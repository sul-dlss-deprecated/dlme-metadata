In pursuance of the decision reached here last December that it would not he possible to resist the Persian claim to take over the management of the lighting and buoying arrangements in their own territory and territorial waters, provisional instractions^which were submitted at P.Z. 181/35 and which were to be subject to any further observations from the Government of India^ were sent to Tehran in Foreign Office telegram No. 2 Saving of 23rd January (P.Z. 548/35). These instructions contemplated handing over to the Persian Government at a fair price, all the lights and buoys maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service in Persian territory or territorial waters including the Qais light vessel, transfer of the latter was, however, to depend on the Persian (Jovernment giving satisfactory undertakings (s) as to the maintenance of the light sht&gt; and (t&gt;) that they would charge reasonable light dues. The Government of India's views which were given in their telegram of 18th January at P.Z. 412/35 were actually received before the issue of the Foreign Office telegram of 23 rd January. They agreed that we could not refuse to hand over to Persia the control of the lighting and buoying arrangements in own territory and territorial waters but as regards 'route' lights they suggested that a scheme suggested by Colonel Wardfbr the re-alignment of the 'route' lights in the Gulf would, if practicable, be preferable to the action proposed in the^breign Office Telegram. Colonel Ward's scheme was further pronounced impracticable by the Admiralty in their letter of 31st Cp z 713 / 35 ) and the Government of India thereupon January (P.Z.i I 1212 5(100 9.32 /[inute Paper.

The Foreign Office accordingly telegraphed to Tehran on 28th February (P.*5L 145U/35) instructing the Minister to present a note to the Persian Government on the lines already contemplated in the provisional instructions. Z. Colonel Y/ard then arrived in Tehran to negotiate &lt; with the Persian Government the details of the transfer to the latter of responsibility for the lighting and buoying arrangements in Persian territory and territorial waters. Records of the discussions between Colonel Ward and the Persian authorities will be found at P.Z. 3378/35 and P.Z. 3528/35. As a result of these discussions&gt; Colonel Ward has been successful in negotiating a most satisfactory provisional agreement with the Persians, subject to confirmation on tne one hand by the Persian Ministry of War and on the other hana by The provisional agreement, which is flagged on the file, provides for the purchase by the Persian Government at the Government of India's valuation of all lights and buoys maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighting Service in Persian territory or territorial waters except the Qais light vessel which the Persians are prepared to rent from the Government of India until such time as they have erected a light house on Qais Island to replace it.

This 3 _ The issue of instructions to the Minister at Tehran to confirm the provisional agreement has been delayed (l) by the question of the disposal of the fixed lights at Henjam and Gharbar maintained by Gable and Wireless It was hoped that it might be possible to settle this question in advance of confirmatidiv, but it has become entangled with the question at present under consideration jof the removal of the Company’s cable stations in Persia I J and the Foreign Office now suggest that since it will not be possible to reach an early decision on the latter question, the question of the disposal of the Henjam and Charbar lights , which in any case is quite umimportant, ^ Is can be shelved for the time being; ( 2 ) the necessity l! i ■ d of confirming that the Navy had not in fact removed from Hen jam at the time of the evacuation, the fixed light and dumb buoy which we have already offered to sell to the Persians.

Kazemi on the 30th April. So far as we can see the only obstacle to this is the fact that we cannot yet give him any instructions about the lights on the cable buildings at Henjam and Charbar, and are not likely to be in a position to do so until the question of the closing of the cable stations has been settled. But it may be some time before a decision is taken on this question and in the circumstances we think that the best thing we can do is to confirm the rest of/ 5. Walton, Esq., C.B. , M.C.of the provisional agreement and leave the relatively unimportant question of the Henjam and Gharhar lights for future settlement. 3. In the circumstances we should like a telegram on the lines of the enclosed draft and (as I am going on leave tomorrow) I should he most grateful if you would let Lambert know as soon as possible after the Whitsun holidays whether you concur in the despatch of something on these lines. 4. The reservation about the views of the Government of India has been included in the draft because we are not certain how far the Government of India’s telegram No* 1236 of the 10th May (India Office letter P.Z. 3229/34 of the 11th May) concurring in the temporary maintenance of the lights and buo^s by Colonel Ward at the expense of the Persian Government is intended to express their concurrence in the rest of the decisions reached at Tehran. But you may think that this reservation is superfluous and in that case it can he omitted. If you prefer to retain it would you be willing/f willing to send a telegram to the Government of India simultaneously with the despatch of the proposed telegram to Tehran asking for them to telegraph their concurrence as soon as possible? 5, I hope that by the time the proposed telegram is despatched the Senior Naval Officer will have furnished the information which we require as to the light that Cable and Wireless Limited say has been moved from Henjam. If the light is the one that has stood on the roof of the cable station nothing need be said about it to Knatehbull-Hugessen in the present telegram. But if it is the Ras-al-Mashia beacon, he will have to be told to amend the list of material already given to the Persian authorities. 6. The provisional agreement which we now propose confirming leaves open the question of the exact arrangements by which the Persian Government will collect the dues wherewith to reimburse Colonel Ward (see Colonel Ward’s letter of the 9th May to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, enclosed in Bagdad despatch Ho. 257of the 10th May and circulated in Foreign Office letter E 3281/33/34 of the 4th June.) This is a question which may need a good deal of discussion, hut that to my mind is all the more reason for clinching the main lines of our settlement with the Persians, i.e. the ’♦provisional Agreement”, as quickly as possible. 7.

Sir, With reference to correspondence ending with Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen 1 s despatch No. 194 of May 2nd last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter from Colonel Ward regarding the proposal to hand over to the Iranian Government the Navigation Lights situated in Iran and in Iranian territorial waters. 2. In his letter and its enclosures Colonel Ward gives detailed information regarding the position, value and general characteristics of the lights in question together with estimates of the expenditure required for their upkeep and suggestions regarding the manner in which this expenditure should he met. This, I understand, will facilitate the continuance of the negotiations in Teluan. 3. Colonel Ward also encloses a statement confirming, subject to slight modifications, the information contained in the memorandum enclosed in Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen’s letter of April 17th to Mirza All Khan Kotamedy. presumably the contents of this statement should he communicated to the Iranian Government without delay. t ^ dpsuatch to His Majesty’s 4.

D.O.A 220 Margil, Basra, Iraq. 9th May, 1935. My dear Sir Archibald, Reference the recent conversations in Tehran concerning the Navigation Lights situated in Iran and in Iranian territorial waters, I think the following might be of some service. It will be seen there is a possibility of them now being handed over to the Government of Iran on or about the 1st July 1935, I therefore feel it my duty to suggest a division in an equitable manner of the present dues and the expenditure etc., in proportion to their running, maintenance costs etc., so that Iran will have some idea of what the charges actually are at present and why they have been so divided. This suggested assessment may also be a useful guide to Iran when they wish to introduce dues to cover their Lighting expenditure and likewise to convey to the Indian Government some idea of how much is likely to be deducted from the present due accruing to them. I accordingly submit herewith a statement showing the revenue and expenditure estimates, together with explanatory notes pertaining to lights within the Territory and under the jurisdiction of the Iranian Government for the early consideration of the Indian Government. For the past two years the Government of India^has allowed , a rebate on the Persian Gulf Light Dues of 3 pies per Net Registered Ton and in view of the assurance of the Iranian Government that they will not enforce a due larger than necessary to defray actual costs etc., for the maintenanc these lights, I have calculated the Revenue from them at rate of 3 pies per N.R.T . T . of both in-coming and outgoing vessels ir A.J.K. Clark Kerr, K.C.M.G., •B.M’S Ambassador, Bagdad. utilisingutilising this Port (Basra) as per details indicated in the accompanying statement. The total expenditure for the upkeep of these lights etc,, is Rs. 85,733« This expenditure has been divided up under 4 Articles as under:- Article 1 - Establishment . This Article has been divided under two separate items viz. (a) Port Establishment, and (b) Iranian Government Establishment, against neither of which has any provision been made. As regards (a) the Port Directorate will not be involved in any additional expenditure in this connection since the existing establishment will do the work* Likewise, if the duties of collection pertaining to (b) are entrusted to the Port Directorate, the Iranian Government also will not have to meet any charges on this account. If, on the other hand, the Iranian Government decide to collect the dues themselves as I expect they will, they will no doubt have to set up a separate and complete Establishment for this purpose, the cost of which is estimated at from ID. 1000 to 1500 per annum. In this event the Iranian Government may find it necessary to raise the rate of Dues from 3 pies per Net Registered Ton to 4 pies to meet the additional expenses involved, which will increase the Revenue to a total of Rs.119001. Article 2 - Running &amp; Maintenance. Under this Article provision has been made for Operations and maintenance of the lights concerned as well as for the hire of NEARCHUS in connection with inspection visits paid in the interests of the upkeep of the Lighting Units. 7 7, - General Charges . The provision under this Article is intended to cover Miscellaneous charges such as Postage, Printing &amp; Stationery etc Article 4Artic ^- 4-Z„,Service of Capital Debt . under this Article provision has been made for replacements and interest charges on the Capital outlay, and is calculated as per details shown in a separate schedule attached. Attached hereto is a detailed statement showing description and characteristics of the various Lights and Buoys I also confirm for the information of the Iranian G-overnment the cost of the list of spares which I gave approximate figures and offered to supply whilst in Tehran (the spare lamp is £324. G.I.P. Basra and not £100 as I finally submitted and which is for a small Buoy light), together with detailed lists of cost of services to be rendered when they take over their lights on or about July 1st, 1935. I would also state that the cost of gas per cylinder is Rs.50 which is the charge at present raised by this Port against the Government of India. It will also be seen from the Notes of the Tehran conversations that the Lighting of Bandar Shahpour will be most likely completed in about 5 months - say October. When these Lights are in operation I am under the impression that the Iranian Government will introduce a Port due on similar lines to that of the Port of Basra. They may like wise introduce a similar due for their other Ports, Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Jask, etc., and I take it this is as it should be, in order that ships using only the Ocean route lights will not be charged for these Ports or Harbour lights in the Light Due. If a charge of 2 pies per G.R.T. for the cost and the upkeep of the minor Port lights was made - at Bushire for instance, I estimate that revenue approximating Rs.6000 would be obtained from shipping using that Port which in my opinion should be ample to maintain the oervice of thes lights,lights, and if* Bandar ohahpour is charged on a somewhat similar basis, ships plying to that Port would know where they stand as regards the service rendered therein and act accordingly. The Harbour or Port lights will then be quite distinct and separate from the light due charged for cost and maintenance of the Ocean Route lights in the Gulf. It will also be seen from the 'T” Notes that it was arranged for me on my return to Basra to give certain information to the Government of Iran as per footnote to the list of spares which I now enclose. I hope authority for my doing so will be given in due course. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J.G. Ward.Statement of Budget Estimates f*oi* year* Explanatory Notes on (l) above. Statement of Capital Assets.

Similarly under the head 'Iranian Government' the column for indication of the necessary provision has been left blank it is anticipated that the Iranian Govt, will itself collect dues in respect of the Lighting Units falling within its Pitorial jurisdiction.

Sir, Tour most obedient, humble Servant, (Sisued) E*M*KiiatchbnllHEEugeseen*A second meeting took place at the Ministry of foreign affairs this afternoon, fhe same persons were present as at the first meeting* Colonel Bayendor opened the proceedings hy stating that a formal assurance had been received from the Ministry of finance that dues would not he levied on shipping at a rate greater than was necessary to cover the costs of operation and maintenance and the amortisation of the capital invested* After His Majesty 1 s Minister had expressed pleasure at the receipt of this assurance, Colonel Bayendor went on to say that the Iranian Government would like to acquire all the lights etoetera mentioned in the list «hioh had teen communicated to the* at the first meeting and at the prices stated in that list, ?&lt;ith the exception of the Qais Island lightship which they would find too expensive to maintain. He proceeded to add that it was the intention of his Government ta ereet instead a lighthouse o» shore which would have a powerful team and wouln same services as the lightship, and which would he cheaper to operate Colonel Bayendor further explained that, while the Iranian Government were ready to purchase as soon as the necessary arrangements coul ively suggested July 1st next as a elate whe ownership might he effected), ii would he and perhaps two years, before the Iranian sufficiently e^iPP ed to 1)6 a * le t0 maintai service themselves* fhey would therefor during this izfceria period Colo e- Ward worn! it, as at present, hut on their hehalf* side of this proposal, he said that th would he ready to defray all the expenses i eady to purchase the lights etcetera, arrangements could he made *he tentat next as a date when the transfer of considerable time e the Iranian authorities would he able to maintain the lighting be most grateful if Colonel Ward would agree to operate their behalf. AS for the financial 3ai d that the Iranian Government the expenses incurred by Colon Wardfard would, like in addition to rent the Qais island lightship, which would remain indispensable until their shor€, light was erected, and he enquired whether Colonel Ward would he prepared to maintain it on the same terms as the other lights. as for the rent the Iranian Government would he prepared to pay a sum which would cover depreciation* fhe Minister then explained that His Majesty's Govern- ment and the Government of India felt that they had a great responsibility towards international shipping, that hitherto we had only been discussing port lights and that the position as regards route lights was somewhat different, since we already maintained a series of such lights outside Iranian territorial waters and intended to continue doing so. Was there not a danger of unnecessary overlapping, the only effect of which would be to increase the charges payable by international shipping ? in reply/Bayendor admitted that the Iranian author ities contemplated the eventual establishment of other eights for the benefit of international shipping,, *•£• island and off Ras-ul-liutaf. but said that their only concrete proposal was for the establishment of a light on -.ais I fhis light would tahe the place of the lightship and, ^being + in a decrease of the cheaper to maintain,might even result in a dues payable by international shipping* . ..

As for the Q,ais Island lightship, it was already there and it seemed a pity to erect a new light. If the Iranian authorities did not wish to maintain it, would it not be simplest for him to continue to do so as at present ? If it was so desired, the lightship 'VY\xnrcA~ could be jaaored outside Iranian territorial waters* Colonel Bayendor reassured him that these other schemes he had spoken of were only indefinite ideas and that there was no question of anything being rushed throu#i; he added that there was no desire to put lights where they were not needed and said that he would be most happy to cooperate further with Colonel War 7 ! in the discussion of technical details* fhey had, however, reached a definite decision to erect a light on q,&amp;is Island and once it was installed, they would have no further need of the jj lightship. Els Majesty* s Minister and Colonel Ward then agreed to accept the proposal that the latter should continue to maintal the existing lights for the present, provided the Government of India gave him the necessary authorisation to fio so, Majesty’s Minister at the request of Colonel Bnyendor gave assurance that His Majesty's Consulate-General at Busnxre would equally maintain for the time being the lights situated within the property of the Consulate-General* His Majesty’s Minister further undertook to communicate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as soon as he »as of instructions in regard to the lights on the bull ‘ &amp; Cables and wireless limited at Kenjaia end QMarlMf As colonel Bayendor was anxious that the Iranian Govern ment should acquire a certain stock of spares at taking over the lights and buoys, Colonel '«ar&amp; furthe undertaking that he would supply any spares and spare parts thattliat might required at cost price, plus freight and handling charges# It was finally agreed that,, as all the delegates would de meeting again next day at luncheon, a list would he drawn uo in the meanwhile hy His Majesty's Legation of the points on which agreement had heen reached^ This list which might he regarded as recording the terms of a provisional agreement would then he communicated to the Iranian delegates for their approval* Hated, Tehran, April 20th, 1935as? a result of th« &amp;i©eus&lt; whloh took plae© at the Miaiatiry for forei^a /ffalr® oa i^rti 16 th and April 2 oth on the subject of limiting m&amp; 'buoying i* the . ere ian dalf, agreement has be i reaish.'-d o- the fo..lowing p^inta :* (a) The Iranian aoverxinaeiit a,gree to purchase from the Govemae&amp;t of India all the liih heuaea* fmops and beacon© mntio od In the attached list and. at the price© abated in that list! with the exception of the r;ale laland lightship; ^ ’f (b) Els Majesty* a minister hai r - usdertaksh to emmm is ate with the imperial jini ©try for rarely Affairs ao mo® m: he is in receipt of inntrustishs with regard to the lights on the buil^- lM 0 * of Cable© and wireless limited at Hen Jam and char bar; {«) II® Majesty* a Minister has agreed that His Majesty* s Oonsulste-chmersl ©t Bushire shsl eootinue to maintain, as lii thert© r the lights which are situated within iw Copy of English ao T British legation, Tehran, April 3oth,1935.

' ’ ■ • ■ v A meeting took place at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs this afternoon at which were present His Majesty^ Minister, Colonel ward and Mr. Loxley, and Colonel Bayendor, another naval officer, Monsieur Motamedy and a further civilian who never spoke throughout the proceedings* !Fh© Minister opened the discussion hy enquiring what were the Iranian proposals in the matter of lighting and buoying, explaining that we had hitherto had charge of this service which was of international benefit and that, in handing these lights and buoys over to Iran, we felt great responsibility in ensuring that the service was transferred and carried on with complete security to international shipping. Colonel Bay en dor said that their first object was to take over and maintain existing lights# They might, where possible, make improvements and they proposed eventually to install certain new lights. Colonel Bayendor was asked whether they proposed, pending the installation of new lights, carry on the existing system as it stood; to wbiea he replied that the question for his Government to decide was whether they were going to take over the material belonging to the Government of India and use it, or whether to buy and install new light*.. The Minister emphasised at this point how essential it was to secure continuity of service. Colonel Bayendor wanted to know what was /meantmeant by the existing system. Bid we intend to convey that where there was, eay f a buoy giving a white, flashing light, there must always be an exactly similar light? Colonel Vard explained that there were two essential points* (1) There must be absolute continuity of service, and (2) Any changes in the existing system must be brought to the notice of mariners well in advance. Colonel Bayendor then said that the Iranians had no immediate changes in view, that they had no desire to take over the service until they were fully equipped to run it and that he would propose to communicate eventually to His majesty’s Legation and all interested parties a full list of the lights, etcetera, that they were going to maintain some three months before they actually began to operate the service. Colonel Ward then said that he $ould wish to be informed in full detail and well in advance of the installation of any new lights and also of the arrangements that would be made to maintain the existing ones. Colonel Bayendor embarked on a list of the existing buoys, etcetera, and soon mentioned his Majesty’s Minister at once observed that Tamb could not oome within the scope of our present discussions. It must be definitely excluded from the negotiations. Colonel Bayendor at once withdrew, saying that he was not concerned with politics and only thought of the technical aide of the question. Motamedy said nothing and the matter was not further discussed. Colonel Bey .noon then .entloo.O &lt;»* on' of hi. ld«. .. to ..tohlll. • «•* »“« «« Colonel «.rd »14 h. ... '' /this— 5 tills and enquired where it would he. Colonel Bay endor said that it would he placed on the ten-fathom line. (H.B. This would probably be about fifteen miles off shore). Asked how he was going to handle these buoys, Colonel Bayendor said that he realised a special ship would be necessary ana that the Government had already asked for tenders. The Minister again spoke of our great international responsibility in this matter. For the sake of the safety of international shipping, it was vital that there should be no break in the lighting service. Colonel Bayendor once more gave a definite assurance that there would be no precipitancy and no desire to embark on the service until the Iranian authorities were fully equipped to maintain it. Th® Minister then mentioned another aspect of our responsibility. At present the Government of India levied a charge on international shipping at a rate that merely covered the expenses of the service and we were vevj anxious to ensure that international shipping would not suffer additional costs in the matter. Colonel Bayendor disclaimed responsitoility and said that he could not speaX with authority. He imagined, bowerer, that the Goremment would levy a tax on the shipping that benefited *rota ti.ese lights and that the rate would have to depend on the coats of the service. The I mister explained thau it *&lt;a8 international custom only to ta*e from shipping the actual costs of service and Colonel payenaor volunteered that h felt sure that his Government would not try and mm a p» out of it. This was a question, however, that uepend on him hut on the Ministry of Finance. Motamedy also /expressed•* 4r *» expressed the oonvietion that the Iranian G^ovsrnmen t would follow the international custom, but the minister said that it would be of great assistance to us to have an authoritative assurance on this point from the Ministry of Finance# After some discussion, liotamedy promised to get in touch with them before the next meeting. The Minister then suggested that he might now com© on to the question of the actual lights, etcetera, to be transferred# Heading from our list he first mentioned Bushire, which caused Colonel Bayendor to break in and enquire about the lights at the entry to the Shatt- el-Arab# Colonel Ward explained that the latter all belonged to the Fort of Basra and that the only lights which we were now discussing were those owned by the Government of India. Colonel Bayendor grasped the point and did not revert to the Shatt lights again# The full list of lights, etcetera, which we were ready to hand over was then communicated to Colon el Bayendor with their values in .Rupees# The beacon at Basidu was no^ mentioned and the Minister explained that he had not yet received final Instructions with regard to the lights on the Bushlre flagstaff and on the telegraph buildings at Henjam ana Oh&amp;rbar* The question of the Qais Island lightship was not discussed at any length as Colon©1 Bayendox his Government would probably find it too expensive over and maintain and that they were more likely ght on the shore. Colonel Bayendor took a copy of the list #£ i prices and said that he would now have to refer to the leral Staff. Before doing so. however, he would be gl»u know whether, in the event of the Iranians wishing to /takeI taKe over these lights, we would he prepared to agree to a provisional period during which we maintained the service and they paid the cost© until such a time as they were in a position to run the whole service on their own. The in is ter and colonel Ward said they had no Instructions on this point but thought it would he possible for us to agree to Colonel Bayendor * s suggestion* Colonel hayendor also took note of the fact that tiie list of lights, etcetera, made no mention of spares and asked if Colonel Ward could supply him with an aoproxifcm&amp;te idea of their cost and if he would b# in a position to supply them# He also requested colonel Ward to give hi® particulars of the characteristics of* the lights in uee. colonel ward explained that it was always possible to alter the ehar act eristics of such lights, but unaertook to supply spares and to comsmnioate approximate prices, together with a rough indication of the costs of Maintaining the service. The meeting thm terminated on the understanding that we would supply these figures tomorrow morning and that they would approach the Ministry of ‘'inane* as regards dues and study our list of prices with the Ministry of War.

HIS Majesty’s Legation present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and, with further reference to the latter’s note verbale of the 22nd November, 1934 (Azar 1, 1313), regarding the question of maritime lights and buoys, have the honour, under instructions ^ ro ^ Hl ® Ma J es , t y ® Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to state that His Majesty s Goveinment willingly agree to the proposal of the Iranian Government that they should assu ^ responsibility for lighting and buoying within their own territory and territoii waters in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The Iranian Government mil no doubt realise that the lights and buoys at present situated wi in iel] ^ , * and territorial waters and belonging to the Government of In Pb, ia Knoyo been managed as part of a unified system in common with otier ig i throughout the two Gulfs, and that, in order to ensure safety o nayig ,. the period while responsibility is being transferred, careful PJ e F 1111 ^ J . n u if tion will be necessary between Colonel Ward, the 0 e lio-htinn lighting service of the Government of India, and the new ra J^r Q i authorities.

My dear Gilbert, Baggallay has shovm me your letter to him, No* P.Z. 2539/35 of the 10th April, enclosing a draft telegram to the Government of India about the proposed light ofljebel Farsi island, and about the status generally of the islands of Farsi, Arabi, Harqus and Kran. 2* I confess that I am not altogether happy about your suggestion that we should ascertain formally from the Sheikhs of Bahrain or Koweit that they see no objection to the proposed light, in order to help to assert Arab claims to the island* 3. It seems clear from the correspondence I have seen that the four islands to which you rexer are at present of genuinely indeterminate status. hs • ar I have been able to ascertain there is not at present any reason to anticipate a Persian claim to tnem, bu if Laithwaite, Esq., G.I.E* n. P m ■ r; *if a Persian claim were made I should have thought that, in view of their distance from the Persian coast, and of the fact that they are generally visited hy Arab fishermen, it should have 'been possible to resist it. In any case much would depend on how the claim was put forward, and I doubt whether there is much to be gained hy considering this very hypothetical contingency further at the present stage. On the other hand, if we now go and interest Koweit or Bahrain in the islands, it seems to me that we may commit ourselves prematurely to a claim by one of those Sheikhs which we shall then have to defend against all comers and which may still leave our own position in regard to the islands indeterminate and unsatisfactory. 4. If there were any means of legitimately taking over the islands ourselves and holding them straight forwardly as British property the position would oe different; but I confess that I am reluctant to try to persuade our Arab proteges to take over islands which, as far as one can see, do not really belong to them*\' them 5, In these circumstances might it not he better, if an unattended light is to be placed on Jebel Farsi, that this should be done without anything being said about it to any Arab ruler or to anyone else, except the mariners whom the light will concern? 6* I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal.T^htvuiuses, Lightships, Buoys and Beacons in Iranian L territory maintained Toy the Persian Gulf Lighting Service.

It is conceivable that, as a p i/! result of these aiscussions, some alteration nay be necessary in the position of the route lights in the Persian Gulf, which H.M.G. think it desirable to maintain so far as possible under their own control and that in this connection an alteration in the position of the Qais lightship may be necessary. But no decision has J yet been reached on this point. J. G. LAITHWAlTfe*leth April, 1935 OFFICE, S.W.l | M 2339/33/34) My dear Laithwaite, Your letter to me of the 8th April enclosed a draft reply to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company about lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf. I think something on the lines you suggest will meet the case. The phrase ’’which His Majesty’s ’’Government think it desirable to maintain so far as ’’possible under their own control” might be thought by the Company a little inconsistent with the fact that we are offering as a first step to sell the light-vessel to the Persians &gt; without explanations into which it is hardly necessary to enter in your letter* But I do not think it matters much. .LVHr^ e, Esq., C.I.F, LaithwaitIMMEDIATE &amp; CONEIDENTIAL. .01923/35.

Ships and is preferable to present arrangements. It is not considered that these proposals would materially affect alignment of route. Prevailing low visibility during sand storms should he taken into account. Frequently merchant vessels have been observed to avoid the main route preferring to pass South of Tumb and Farrur. If Persians have a light at Quais it would be an added convenience if efficiently maintained. The above comments give only navigational view without regard to politics.

Admiralty concur with your view that it is undesirah that route lights in Persian Gulf should pass to Persians As, however, there is nothing to prevent Persians from erecting new route lights in order to justify levy of dues balance of advantage probably lies in allowing them to take over gais Light Vessel if they will undertake to charge dues upon a reasonable scale. Colonel ward is proceeding to Tehran shortly to negotiate on this basis, th. An earlier* version of Colonel Ward s suggestions for re-organisation of lights has been considered in London Atairs-lty view is that any scheme involving the re-alignmen' o.i the existing shipping route is impracticable, since it would traverse waters which have not been sufficiently uosely surveyed. Moreover, new route could not be enfor ces on merchant shipping. Admiralty do not consider light is necessary on iffe Bank and have suggested that if it is necessary to Mre .ais Light Vessel it should be moored in position *® s t of r'crur hoal, thus obviating necessity for buoy “sntioned in your submission.FrMl .The coramaader-in-Chief, East Indies Station. )Vt ..Bahrein. rs te...I8tb January, 1935.

Mendel’s room at the Foreign Office on 6th Tecember, 1934, to discuss the cuestion of the lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf, and *skec asy opinion on the asatter. 2. I strongly concur with the importance of the cistico tlon between 'Port' and 'iioute' lights which was pointetfout by the Admiralty Representatives and consider that it would be most undesirable if the ’Route' Lights were to be malnt&amp;ted in future by the Persifins. 3. The port lirector of Basra, Colonel J.C. ,&lt;ard. also mentioned this matter during my visit to Fesra and stated that he, at the request of H.M. Ambassador in Iraq, had been considering how all 'route' lights could be kept uneer the present administration if Persia persists in her intention to take over all lights in her territory. est ent 4. The only 'route' light affected is the ^ais Light Vessel and Colonel ward had suggested that this vessel &amp;ould be removed and a light be established Instead on Cirri Island. Chen suggesting this, Colonel ward was under the torses ion that Sirri Island belonged to the Sheikh of I ebai. it was nolnted out to colonel ward that such a solution was probably* impracticable in view of past Persian action in connection with'the ownership of Cirri island. 5. Alternative methods of securing the end in view were then discussed and it was finally agreed with Colonel «ard that the following action would be quite practicable ant world meet all requirements lii Move ais Light Vessel to the Stiffs Bank; iii) Establish a Light buoy on the western end of jar or shoal more than 6 miles from the Persian coast. 6. Colonel ..arts did not anticipate any difficulty in “iBteaance and it would appear that with these two marks the passage of shipping, especially that coming f~(H8 the «om, would in f4£ be facilitated ns conmared with the present arrangement of having the one light only oxx v J is island. 7.

The question of a share in the shipping dues collected in the Shatt el Arab also seeius to me to be of lanortance and to be solved by the above proposal, since If all ''route' lights were maintained Independently of Persia that country would not appear to have any reasonable grounds for claiming a share in these dues.

'Shoreham', regarding the proposal to change the present tanker route in the' Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that Colonel Ward returned to Basra on February 17th after a tour of ten days during which he carried out checking surveys on Stiffe Bank, Farur Shoal and Mariner Shoal. 2. Stiffe Bank was sounded by Patent Sounding machine and Kelvin tubes and was ascertained to conform to the general dimensions indicated in the largest scale Admiralty chart. The bank was found to be flat, with an average depth of fifteen fathoms. 3. Owing to the heavy swell running on February l^th, B 1 arur Shoal was sounded from a motor launch. Fno smalles soundings taken over the southern part (viz. 4 fathoms) to show that those on the Admiralty chart of this area (viz. 2 | fathoms) may not be an accurate indication of the actual depth of water. 4. The smallest sounding on Mariner Shoal was approxima J five fathoms. 5. In all three areas the bottom was found to consist of sand and shell and the holding is considered good. 6 . Colonel ?\Tard landed at Jebel Farsi Island opinion that with the gear at his disposal he coulo 1 ffght Honourable ^ John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc..in three weeks, a non-attended light which would give a range of 15 miles, , 7 # Buoys or light floats could be placed on the Parur and Mariner Shoals. B, Colonel Ward has passed on to me portions of his correspondence with the Naval authorities in the Gulf showing that the proposal to shift the present light from Kais to Jebel Farsi is some eight years old and action in this sense could well be taken in the general interests of shipping independent of anything that may be said or done during his forthcoming visit to Tehran. 9 , I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, the Government of India and the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

My dear Laithwaite, The draft telegram to Tehran about the prices of certain lights and buoys in the Gulf will reach you f*s officially today in our letter E 1244/33/34. It has also gone to Admiralty and Board of Trade. I now enclose a re-draft of the telegram to India ^ (to which paragraph 6 of the draft telegram to Tehran refers). You will doubtless amend this as you think fit and obtain the concurrence of such other departments as you think fit. As I mentioned on the telephone Captain Lawson /1 of Gable and Wireless, saw no particular objection to our finding out the value of the lights and trying to make an arrangement with the Persians which v/ould secure the privacy of their officials: nor did he have any particular objection to carrying on as at present, whether the Government of India paid or the Persian Government did so. He Laithwaite, Esq., G.I.E.probably feels that the ideal solution would he that eventually the Persians should set up thdir own lights right av/ay from the company’s buildings, and he does not want the company to become the creditors of the Persians for large sums or to be tied to the arrangement if the Persians default. But otherwise he is quite happy for us to go ahead. Incidentally, he says the company took over the beacon at Jask, as well as the lights at Hen jam and Charbar, from the Indo European Telegraph Department. I do not think he attaches much importance to the ownership of any of this property, which was thrown in with everything else for the lump sum of £450,000. As the beacon is av/ay from the buildings there is no need to make special arrangements regarding its maintenance and as it is included in the Government of India’s list it seems scarcely necessary to mention th^ question ownership at all to Tehran or Ward. If the question becomes acute, the Government of India ana the company must decide between them who is to pocket tho h' 0 V problematicalg 1244/33/34, i F. 0., draft. Dffice FelDruary , 7.755 .

N/53 of February 5 , 1935 , which you may have received direct, but of which copy follows in my despatch No. of 2. Light used on Bushire Residency flag staff is Residency property. Political Resident is being asked for estimate of value, but if value is small, it is proposed, if Government of India agree, that you shoula olfer to lend it to Persian Government free of chaige for so long as it is used on flagstaff. 3. As it is possible for Persian officials to approach flagstaff without entering Town Residency...•Residency it is unnecessary notwithstanding fact that flagstaff is property of Government of Indii to safeguard privacy of members of Residency staff in event of Persian authorities continuing to use flagstaff for navigational purposes, 4. All that is required is that Persian Government should be urged to maintain light on flagstaff unless and until they make alternative arrangements and in that case to give ample time for these arrangements to be brought to notice of mariners. If, by any chance, they ask that Residency should continue to maintain light for time being you may agree. 5. Light on Telegraph building at Gharbar is property of Gable and Wireless Limited. Local representatives of Compaq are being asked, through Government of India and Political Resident, to indicate its value; and if value is sm all a S r ee to arrangement whereby you. should on ex uo lend it to Persian authorities free of charge for so long as it is used in its present position...position and its upkeep is left to company's officials (see next paragraph). 6. As this light is situated on roof of company * s building it would probably be difficult for Persian authorities to maintain it without constantly invading privacy of company’s officials. If this is confirmed, you should in any case (i.e. even if suggestion for lending light free of charge falls through) suggest to Persian Government that unless and until they make alternative arrangements they should employ the company as their agents for the maintenance of the light just as the Government of India have hitherto done. In this case also it is most necessary that mariners should have ample notice of any changes. 7. Paragraphs 5 and 6 will apply equally to light on Telegraph building at Henjam if lights and buoy at Henjam are discussed in spite of terms of paragraph 9 of my telegram Ho.2.

My dear Laithwaite, I am enclosing herewith a copy of an official letter from the Admiralty about lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf. The answers to the three questions in your letter P.Z.412/35 of the 19th January are as follows (a) The Qais light ship could not be altogether suppressed without a certain increase of navigational risk, although it is difficult to say that it is really essential. (b) This is dealt with in the official Admiralty letter. Abu Musa is no good because it would involve a re-alignment o± the rou e. The Admiralty suggest a position west of Parur Shoal, outside Persian territori waters. (c) This is fully answered in the official letter, I am sending copies of this letter to Rend el at the Foreign Office and Gr inis haw at the Bo- of Trade. i Uthwaite, Esq. , India Office, S. W. 1.

January 193 5 Sir, A. \ I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to state that They have had under consideration Foreign Office letter No.E.7700/1662/34 of the 14th January 1935, enclosing a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad on the subject of lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf, together with a telegram No.171 dated 18th January from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India. Their Lordships are in agreement with the view expressed by the Government of India to the effect that it would be desirable to have an alternative scheme of ^route** lights in the Persian Gulf before Colonel Ward embarks on negotiations with the Persian Government. They are, however, of the opinion that any scheme v/hieh involves the re-alignment of the existing shipping route, such as the scheme propounded by Colonel Ward in his letter to Sir Francis Humphreys dated 8th December, is impracticable, both on account of the impossibility of insisting that a different route should be followed by merchant shipping and also because such a route would necessarily traverse waters which have not been surveyed with sufficient closeness to ensure that there are no hidden dangers to navigation. After a careful review of all the circumstances, Their Lordships are of opinion that the most satisfactory alternative to the present system would be the removal of the...... 1( 3er secretary of State, India Office,the Qais lighu vessel to a position to the west of T^arur Such a position would possess great advantages from Shoal the navigational point of view, since the route normally followed passes through the comparatively narrow gap 'between Farur Shoal and Jezirat Farur. Furthermore the light vessel would be situated at a distance of more than 6 miles from either the mainland or Jealrat Farur, and therefore outside waters claimed by Persia as territorial, although with the 'adjacent zone*. Farur shoal is completely submerged at all states of the tide. Having regard to the depth of water, Their Lordships regard it as unnecessary to place a light on Stiffe Bank. The proposal to palace a light buoy on the Shah Allum Shoal does not seem to be directly connected with the immediate problem in issue and will no doubt be considered by the Government of India on its own merits as a possible assistance to vessels making Bahrein. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. As requested by the Foreign Office, the original charts prepared by Colonel Wait'd are enclosed herewith. I am.

You would address note to Minister for Foreign Affairs u following effect: His Majesty’s Government willingly agree to roposal of Persian Government that they should assume esponsibility for lighting and buoying within their own territory and territorial waters in I'ersian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, ersian Government no doubt realise that lights and buoys at resent located in their territory and territorial waters and ) elonging to Goveiamierit of India have hitherto been managed as )&amp;rt of unified system in common with other lights and buoys j hroughout two Gulfs, and that careful preliminary consultation ls necessary between Colonel ward the head of . ersian Gulf lighting service of Government of India, and the new Persian lighting authorities in order to ensure salety of navigation ^ring period of transfer of responsibility. His Majesty s J overament accordingly propose to ask Iragi Government to allow u0lone l ^ard to go Co Tehran to assist you in discussing these questionstestions with Persian Government, If rersian Government , d care to acquire any of lights and buoys mentioned above 1 id belonging to Government of India, His Majesty's Government ill gladly authorise you and Colonel viand to discuss in Idition question of terms upon which transfer of this property mid take place. In meanwhile His Majesty s Government hope iat Persian Government will instruct their maritime ithorities to take no steps to secure control of lights and joys concerned until necessary arrangements have been made ad agreement reached on various questions involved. 3. You would add that as Colonel Ward is also servant of raqi Government exact date of his visit must depend on when he an obtain leave of absence from Iraqi Government. 4. Intention underlying this proposed communication is that olonel Ward shall assist you not only to negotiate comprehensive usiness settlement for transfer at fair price of lights and iuoys belonging to Government of India, but also if possible )btain some guarantee regarding dues* 5. Instructions regarding prices required for material md other details will be communicated to Colonel Ward l ater * Principal item is lightship at Qais Island, valued some £10,000, while other items might come to £5,00Q more, iovernment of India are, however, preparing revise Instructions will cover questions of lights on former Residency flagstaff at Bushire and on telegraph buildings at Henjam an 'harbar and beacon at Basidu. 6. Transfer of Qais lightship (which is 'route, lig ° inlf shipping as distinct from 'port” lights at Bushire, fill, however, depend in addition on Persian. Government giving satisfactory'undertaking, preferably .in writing, (a) ^inten&amp;nce, (b) as' to - dues.* 7.7. 5^ Apart from question of light-vessel, however. His Majesty’.s Government and Government of India (see their telegram No* 171 to India Office, repeated as No. 12 to you) attach greatest importance to question of dues. They would therefore wish you in any case to use your best endeavours to persuade Persian Government to undertake, either as condition of transfer of existing material, or independently, that any dues they decide to charge for the maintenance of their new system shall he cn a reasonable scale. I realise, however, that there are in fact no effective means of preventing Persian Government from collecting what dues they like, (possibly under some other nretext) whether they take over lighting and buoying or not, and care must be taken not to suggest to Persian Government possibilities which might not otherwise have occurred to them. But you could at any rate point out that Government of India have never taken more revenue than has been necessary for maintenance of service, and that this is practice of practically all civilised corntri 8. If Persian Government indicate that they have no intention of acquiring any of existing lights or buoys (jou nay if necessary, and in advance of colonel turd s arrival, pote amounts mentioned in paragraph 5 above as v^xy rout estimate of sums involved, hut without implying that pur at this price is only point involved) or if Colon-1 visit fails to lead to a settlement, you would mtorm them that in that case Government of India will remove lights and tuoys concerned as soon as Persian Government have made their own arrangements, 9, As regards tactics, you should not communicate list of lights and buoys in advance of Colonel -ard might NT j 1 i4. ight only lead to controversy over Rooka Channel lights, nd possibly over Tamb, which is of course entirely separate uestion regarding which each side knows other’s views Iready* We contemplate that on arrival of Colonel Ward you ad he should endeavour to ascertain intentions of Persian avernment with regard to dues, maintenance of existing lights, stallishment of new lights, etco, before showing your own mds, and should especially endeavour throughout to keep them rom raising questions of: (a) lights and buoy at Hen jam (I .realise this is rather forlorn hope), (b) such of lights and buoys in Rooka Channel system as may conceivably be in Persian territorial waters 0 ’ necessary, however, I approve replies about Tamb and Rooka laiinel suggested in paragraph 5 of your telegram Ho* 168• 10o You should make every effort to prevent question of flit of territorial waters from being raised as practical issue* lis could be done by indicating if necessary when detailed igotiations begin that outer anchorage buoy should he included 'cause it forms part of navigation system of port of Bushire, 11. I realise that it may not he possible to reach final 'ttlement during Colonel Ward * s visit, unless this is unreasonably ulongedo But you should endeavour to settle main points while 5 is in Tehran, and in any case I torust that personal discussions Uh him will assist you materially in any later negotiations. You. lould of course keep me and Government of India informed of all 'gotiations., 12.

Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter E 7120/1662/34 of 30th November, 1934 enclosing copies of telegrams from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran relative to the proposal of the Persian Government to take over the management of the lights and buoys in Persian waters, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to forward to you for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad enclosing a letter from Colonel Ward, in which the latter suggests an alternative route for steamers proceeding up and down the Persian Gulf, 2. With regard to Colonel Ward’s remarks respecting the levying of light dues by the Persian Government, I am to observe that the Persian Government will in any event be able to levy such dues as they please at their own ports, but of course nowhere else. 3. The island of Sirri, which is mentioned in Colonel Ward’s proposal (l) as a possible site for a light-house, is in the de facto possession of Persia. It appears, however, to be clear that an additional light will be necessary in the neighbouring waters, if the Qais light-vessel is moved to Stiffa Bank; and I am therefore to suggest that the question whether/ Dnder Secretary of State, India Office.whether the same result could not he obtained by the erection of a light on the island of Abu Musa should be considered. 4. The placing of a light at the Shah Allum Shoal does not appear to affect the case, in that it does not replace any light at present in Persian territorial waters. 5. Similar letters are being sent to the Admiralty and Board of Trade, 6. The set of charts of the Persian Gulf mentioned in paragraph 5 of the enclosed despatch have 'been sent to the Admiralty with a request that they may he passed to the Board of Trade and India Office in due course.

X have now received the enclosed letter fro® hi®, - in which he suggests (a) that the main shipping route in the Oulf should be changed so as to run as far as possible outside Persian territorial waters, and (b) that the necessary consequential alterations should be made in the position ot lights and buoys in the Gulf so as to allow the main route to pass to the Southward of the present one, thus rendering chipping es far as possible independent of the new arrangements proposed by the Persian Government. 3. You will note that, in Colonel Tard's opinion, the ( suggested new route would be as safe and direct a® the present one, and that', in the circumstances of the present time, it would probably be more satisfactory* colon appears in fact to be following the earn© principle adopted by British air lines in operating outside the orbit ^ Persia rather than run the risk of endless complications with hi HAnH ^ith the Persian Oovarnmant# 4« Frora this point of view, his proposals appear to have a good &amp;aal to reooKM&amp;a them, and I shall be glad to be favoured with your observations* 5# The enclosed mt of charts accompanied Colonel l ard’s letter. 6.

Bth T&gt;# cumber, 1934, %ty dear Sir Francis, deference my oonfidential letter of December 6th 1954* It occurred to m$ in view of the fact of the Persian Sovermtent having suggested that the lights and huoys situated on Persian soil and in Persian territorial vaters he handed over to them, that the government of India ,•sight not quite like the idea of trusting the care and saint enane® of these lights on the main Ter si an Gulf route (upon which the safety of many vessels almost entirely depends) to Persian Light-Keepers whose sense of responsibility in respect of the maintenance of these lights my leave much to be desired - quite apart from the fact that by taking over these lights they can, legitimately X think, charge a light due on all ships, a portion of which might conceivably be used for other purposes (i • e• Persian Wavy) • I therefore submit that the lights on the main routes be removed from Persian territorial waters so that fort charges can be levied on those which remain in Persian waters or on Persian soil only , i*e* those st Bush ire, Hanjs Bundar &gt;bbas and Jask, which are local harbours, *md not general light due which we levy on behalf of the Government of India. My proposals therefore are as follows.- (i) Build «n unattended lighthouse on the summit of •Tealrat sirri Island Lat* £6• 54^ N* Long' f&gt;4.31^ IS underatand •o u « * ye, •S s Aabaesador* Beghdad.understand belongs to the meikh of Abu rhabi t similar to the Muscat Light and visible all round for 12 miles, The probable cost of its erection would be about $a»l 00 and could be built by the Port in two months. (2) i&gt;hift the Kais Island Light Vessel to the tiff© Bank (Lat. 26.26 }U Long. 63.9 ?*.) and rename her the Stiff© Bank light Vessel. (3) Place a light buoy on the shah Allum ^hoal (Lat.26.35{r Long. 52.301 E.) which would be of considerable help to vessels making Bahrein. These alterations, as shown on the charts attached (Admiralty Pas. 2837a, 2837B. and 2830 with old course shown in black and proposed in rad) would give ©hipping bound to the Bhatt-al-Arab as safe a course and equally direct as the present one, in fact I am inclined to think it a better course for vessels to follow as they would, in passing South of Tanb Island, pick up the light on Jesirat Sirrl before dipping the Tanb Light and idee vers®. With the Light Vessel on the Stiff© Bank they can set a course as now and the twenty fathom line off Bas Mutaf will indicate whether the vessel is set or not. Yours sincerely, (signed) J.C. rAPH.

The Admiralty have since explained their views as regards the removal of the Q,ais lightship (see Mr. Seal 1 s letter of 22nd December on P. Z. 7909/34). 1 What it comes to is that they are prepared to agree to instructions to the Persians on the/lines of paragraph 17 of the report of the inter-departmental meeting of 6 th December (P. Z. 7773/34), provided that the wording of the note is such as to leave it open to us to remove the Qais lightship outside Persian jurisdiction if it is impossible to strike a bargain with them and that the instructions to Colonel Pewle are such as to leave the issue of the future of the lightship open until he has met the Persians and possibly obtained some information as to their intentions. 2. The Foreign Office are prepared to agree generally with the line taken by the Admiralty and, subject to the Government of India’s observations, we need not dissent from it. 3. The Foreign Office have in these circumstances (Cc' prepared/draft instructions to the Minister at Tehran, which are below and which are substantially ba^ed on conclusions of the meeting of 6th Decembei with modifications to meet the point taken by the Adm‘ Y in their letter of 22nd December.

Milita My dear Rend el You will recollect that at the Meeting on the 6th December to discuss Persian lights and buoys it was arranged that the Admiralty representatives should consult their higher authorities and obtain a decision as soon as possible about Qais lightship. The Admiralty do not wish to insist upon the immediate removal of Qaia lightship. If you will cast your mind back to the meeting you will recollect that the Admiralty representatives subsequently withdrew this suggestion and said that they thought the Admiralty would be prepared to accept the surrender of the lightship to the Persians but only in ( return for an agreement a bikit dues. Our attitude is that the 'route” lights must be distinguifehed from the ‘port” lights not only as a matter of practical navigation but also because the former unlike the latter are a matter of international concern. It seems to us that the Government of India have assumed responsibility on behalf of the civilised world in genera1 1 to maintain a reliable system of lights at a reasonable cost for the benefit of shipping passing up and down the Gulf.t~ The port lights on the other hand are in an entirely different category since they are only of use to shipping actually entering Persian ports. In the light of these considerations, we do not think it would be unreasonable for the Government of Indi adopt the attitude that they are only prepared to leave the Qais ( *ndel f Esq., foreign Office, 8 . W. 1. tQais lightship in Its present position and to share the responsibility for the route lights with the Persian Government if the latter will in its turn recognise the obligation which the Government of India have always observed - namely to ms in tain the lights without charging excessive dues, 'le are now prepared to agree in the despatch of the proposed note to the Persians (see paragraph 17 of the report of the Meeting providing the wording of the note is such as to leave it open to us to remove Qais lightship outside Persian jurisdiction if it is impossible to strike a bargain with them, and provided that Colonel Ward is given instructions in the sense of the following paragraphs, which will leave the issue of the future of the lightship open until he has met the Persians and possibly obtained some information as to their intentions. The instructions we have in mind for Colonel lard would be to the effect that H.M. Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India both attach great importance to avoiding the levy of excessive dues at Abadan or elsewhere by the Persians, as well as to the maintenance of a reliable system of lighting for the route up the Gulf; that he should therefore endeavour to ascertain so far as possible what are the intentions of the - era la ns wi„h rega to the levy of dues, the maintenance of existing lights, and to/establishment of fresh ones, etc.; and that when he has “drawn* them as much as possible he should repot « b coming to any settlement. It will also, WS think, be necessary to warn him to endeavour to keep the Persians off the qiesti Hen jam.Henjao lights . and of those of the Hookah Channel lights which nay he regarded as in Persian territorial waters; and he might also toe told that any Suggestions he can Bake for attaining the objects in view will be carefully considered.

In the absence of any suggestion that the terms on which Persia acquiesce a in the establishment and maintenance of these lights includea e provision that they should become Persian property, I think it is safe to assume that in la% there has been no change in the title to them, and that we are entitled to u&lt;ke them away if %e wish to do soa 1 should perhaps add that this opinion is based rather on general principles then on anything else* If any municipal iaw is applicable to the question, I suppose that it would be Persian law, but even if Persian law contains any relevant Provision, which is, I imagine, unlikely, I think that we could successfully maintain that it would not be applicable to the Property of a foreign government which was placed and has remained ^ Persian territory with at any rate something like t&amp;cit acquiescence on the part of the Persian Government.*&gt;, 2 . 7481 / 34 .

THE Under-Secretary of State for foreign Affairs . presents his 1 compliments to ^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop of the under-mentioned paper. Foreign Office, !% , 193-^ . Reference to previous correspondence :7449/1662/M) l LIOffr?»p iy- ; g BU.)Yi::o I?- TKR pbrsiaw mirp A meeting was held in Mr. Renders room on the evening of the 6th December to discuss this question. The following were present Mr. Rendel Mr. Baggallay Foreign Office Mr. A.E. Lambert India Office Mr. Crombie Captain Jackson ) Commander Dickson Admiralty Mr. Seal Mr. Grlmshaw ) Board of Trade Captain Brandon ) The first point discussed was whether it would be possible in principle to resist the Persian Government’s claim to take over the responsibility for the lighting and buoying system insofar as it lay within Persian territory or territorial water's. After some discussion it was agreed that His Majesty’s Government could not refuse the Persian demand to take over the management of the lighting and buoying system situated within indieoutably Persian territory or territorial waters, but that this did not preclude His Majesty Government from asking reasonable terms for the transfer to Persia of any lights or buoys which were the property of His Majesty’s Government or of the Government of India# UlTHrfAITS pointed out In thie connexion that the Government ofOf India were directly concerned both as the owners of the property and as being responsible for lighting and buoying arrangements for the Gulf and that it would be necessary to consult them and secure their concurrence in any action which might be proposed as the result of the present meeting. In reply to a question by Mr. Rendel he agreed thet speed was of importance, but said he saw no reason to anticipate delay. 2. It was agreed th^t the precise policy to be followed in this question must depend to a large extent on the nature of the various lights and buoys concerned, and the meeting accordingly decided to consider these one by one as described in the attached analytical list of the more important lights prepared by Mr. Baggallay on 27th November (see minutes in E 7120) on the basis of a list supplied by the Chancery of His Majesty^ Legation at Tehran on 6 th October, 1935 (Tehran Ho. 377/0*30/2 of 6 th October - Foreign Office number E 6373/3062/34)). These lights were gone through in order. (1) As regards the Bushire Consulate-General lights, it was agreed that if the flag-staff was British property and was planted in ground owned by the Consulate-General, the lights would be the property of His Majesty^ Government, It was agreed that before a decision could be reached as to whether these lights could be handed over to the Persian Government or not, it would be necessary to ascertain the facts as to the ownership of the ground, etc. The India Office undertook to do this by telegraph. It was agreed, however, that these particular lights were of little importance. ( 2 ) The lights kept up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, It was agreed that these could not be dealt with in any agreem betweenbetween Hie Matty's Government and the Pe ralfin . Persian Oovernment, since they were presumably the private * Private property of the Anwlo- Persian Oil Company, who would no doubt make t eir own arrangement® with the Persian Government for their future maintenance. (3) Lights kept up by Gable and wireless Company Limited for the Government of India. These two light® (one at Charbar and one at Hen jam) both being on the Company's buildings are probably the private property of the Company. The India Office representatives suggested that the Company were acting as agents for the Government of India, who paid them a fee for the maintenance of the lights. It wa® agreed, however, that thi® would not necessarily give the Government of India any right® over the lights, and would ‘ not necessarily justify His Majesty’s Government in objecting to the Iersian Government taking over the Government of India's liability towards the Company for their future maintenance. It was agreed that the India Office should attempt to clear up this point by telegraph. (4) Beacon kept up by the British Maval author! tie® in the roadstead at Basidu. The Admiralty and Board of Trade representatives explained that this wa® merely a wooden beacon of little value or importance. which, apart from eventual renewal, only required repainting from time to time, and that it was unnecessary to make any special provision regarding it or even to mention it in any discussions which might take place with the Persian Government In fact the less said about it tha better. , * °* The remaining ten lights, buoys and beacons all appear * Subsequently found to be thirteen see footnote to list in Annex.appear to be kept up by Colonel Ward's organisation, noting on behalf of the Government of India. They consist of one lightship off Qaie Island (valued by Colonel Ward in 1931 at approximately 158,000 rupees, i.e. about £10,000), a flashing light at Hen Jam. a group flashing light and a atone beacon at Jaak, and three lighted and alx unlighted floating buoys, which (especially the lighted buoya) are of considerable value. All of these sea-marks, except the stone-beacon at Jask, could be removed, - the buoys without any difficulty. The light and the buoy at Hen jam also formed the subject of a brief separate discussion recorded in paragraph 5 below. 4* It was agreed that since the lightship and these buoys were easily removeable it would be reasonable to ask the Persian Government to pay a fair price for them. Failing a fair price Hi© Majesty’s Government would clearly be entitled to remove them. It was assumed at this stage of the discuesion that they were indisputably British (or Government of India) property. &amp;• The Admiralty representatives pointed out that a difficulty would arise in connexion with the lights at Hen jam ♦ which were mainly used by His Majesty's Ships, and could not be regarded in quite the same category as the lights at an ordinary Persian port. It would be particularly unfortunate if the Persians attempted to collect dues from His Majesty s Ships at Hen jam, and apart from such dues the lights were a liability and not an asset. Mould it not b© best to ^ay nothing about these lights and hope that the question would not be raised by the Persians, i.e- treat them on the same ba &amp;is is the beacon at Basidu? It was pointed out however thatthat the Persians would certainly not acquiesce in this, and that in view of their policy on the question of Hen jam they would certainly insist on taking over this light and this huoy unless they were removed by His Majesty’s Government. 6* Mr* RKKDJ2L pointed out that in all the circumstances the balance of argument aeemed to lie in favour of trying as soon as possible to negotiate a business settlement with the Persians, by which they should take over these lights and buoys for a fair price. It had been agreed that we could not prevent the Persians from taking over the lighting and buoying system in territory and waters under their undisputed sovereignty, and it would therefore seem better to attempt to dispose of the question by friendly settlement, rather than play for time or adopt obstructive tactics which would not be to anybody’s ultimate advantage. At this stage of the meeting tnis view appeared to be more or less generally accepted, and it was agreed that the best plan would be to suggest to the Persian Government that arrangements should be made in agreement with the Iraqi Government for Colonel faz'd to be made available for early discussion with the competent Persian authorities with a view to reaching a comprehensive agreement to provide for the transfer. Colonel Ward had great personal prestige and an intimate knowledge of the whole question. He had considerable Influence with the Persians and he would probably be abxe to reach a more favourable agreement with them than anyone else. If» however, the Persians should refuse to pay a reaBonable price for the lights and buoys, those which were easily removeable could still be taken away by His Majesty s ovemaen for us e elsewhere.7. in connexion with the question of the precise list of lights to be handed over, m. mimim raised the question of the light at Tamb* MB. RENDSL explained that the situation as regards the light at Tasib was entirely different from that of the lights in Persian territory, Tamb was not Persian territory and His Majesty’s Government were committed to resisting any Persian aggression against it. They had aade their position quite plain to the Persian Government, and if Persia made any attempt to take over the light at Tamb f the question would, not be one of lighting and buoying, but one of major politics. So long therefore as His Majesty's Government maintained their present policy towards Persian territorial claims in the Persian Gulf - and there was no reason to believe that they would change it — the Board of Trade need have no fear of Persia acquiring control over this light. MB. OKIMSBAW having raised the question of the Little Quoin light, MB. LAITHWAXTS pointed out that this island belonged to Muscat, and that there was equally no question of Persia being able to establish any kind of claim to control tile light. 8. The question was then raised of the lights in the Hookah Channel. It was pointed out that the Persian Government might not intend to raise the question of these lights, since t**ey have not addressed any communication to the Iraqi Government on the subject of the lights. It was Suggested, however, that as the lights for the Hookah Channel ana Shatt al Arab formed a unitary system, it would be highly inexpedient that those few lights In Persian territorial waters should be taken over by Persia. It was also important if ngm '$&gt; ' i if possible to avoid raising the question as to the respective limits of Persian and Iraqi territorial waters at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab* This point was not pursued, but it was j agreed that the uncertainty regarding the position of these lights was a strong reason for not presenting the Persians at the outset with any detailed list of the lights which we should be prepared to hand over, or rather regarding the transfer of which we should be prepared to negotiate, and it was agreed that it would be better not to send in such a list (as suggested In paragraph 3 of Mr* Hugessen*s telegram No. 168 of 26th November) but to leave it to Colonel Ward, when the time came, to discuss with the Persian authorities precisely which lights and buoys should be transferred and on what terms. 9. The question was then discussed whether there was any possibility of linking up this question with that of the proposed 8hatt-el~Arab Conservancy Board Convention, on the lines suggested in paragraph 8 of Mr. Hugessen’s telegram Ho. 168. After considerable discussion it was agreed that the prospects of the Conservancy Board proposals materialising were at present so unfavourable, and that the dangers inherent In any attempt to play for time with the Persians might prove fio serious, that it would be better not to make any such attempt; and that, as between the courses of action suggested In paragraph 3 and paragraph 8 of Mr* Hugessen * s telegram, the balance of argument was definitely in favour of the former* 10* MR. GRIMSKAW then raised the question of dues. He explained that he was acting to some extent as the trustee &amp; ofOt British Shipping interests. T he dues charged for light!,. and buoying services were a matter of vital concern to British shipping, and it was most important that some satisfactory arrangement should be made regarding due© In future. MR explained that hitherto the dues for the whole of the lighting and buoying nei'vloee in the Persian 0ulf had heen charged at Basra under the supervision of Colonel Ward. if say, 50$ Of the lights In the Gulf were removed from Colonel Ward’s supervision and direction, obviously the dues charged by Colonel Ward would have to be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the expenditure for which his administration were responsible. The Persian© would no doubt charge their own dues for the Independent Persian lighting and buoying eervice which they proposed to set up, but these dues would only be charged at Persian ports which much of the ahipplr^ involved did not visit* 11# The Admiralty representatives pointed out that His Majesty’s ©hips and tankers were closely concerned, owing to their frequent visits to refuel ©t Abadan, Although the waterway was entirely in Iraq the Persians could demand the payment of dues before oiling was permitted and this gave them a hold over our tankers at Abadan. 12. MR. fimDMX* said that he thought that it would be luite impossible to conclude any agreement with the Persians regarding the dues which they should levy in the future in Persian ports for the maintenance of their own lights. MR* 0RIM8HAW was prepared to acquiesce in this view, but pressed strongly that Colonel Ward should be instructed to raise the Point. He felt that ha owed it to the British shipping interests concerned to see that every effort was made to ensureensure if poeeible that the Persian. 8houla not ^ exeeaeive dues or dues greater than were neoe B8ar . y for th , maintenance of the lights. fould it v wouia it not be poselble to provide in on exchange of notes with the „ f® Persian Government j for a definite scale of dues, or at any rate for reasonable dues in future? MH. SBJim r 9 lt quite certain that there would be no hope, of obtaining any undertaking of this icind fro« the Persian Govemaent. The lights would be in their own territory, managed for the Persian Government probably by some foreign concessionary company, and he felt pretty sure that the Persians would charge the highest dues they could hope to obtain, irrespective of anything which we night say to them. in any case the question of future dues ooulu hardly be linked up with the agreement for the transfer of the lights and buoys now under consideration, which really amom.teu to little more than the sale of certain property to the Persian Government against a sal table consideration. It was agreed, however, that there would be no objection in putting this point to Colonel yard as soon as possible and asking for his observations as to whether anything could possibly be done to ensure that the dues charged by the rare lane in future were not unreasonable. 13* MR. 8KAL then explained that speaking personally, ^ * 110 right it might be desirable for the lightship at Qais island1 / island to be removed out of Persian territorial waters as soon as possible In any case. MR. R WDWl 6al(J that h© thought that this course would hardly be compatible with the proposal to negotiate a transfer of the lights and buoys on terms. fe could either remove all our property in advance and leave the Persians to provide for the future independently in their own way, or w© could try to conclude a bargain with them and hand over the lights { and buoys against suitable payment. But he did not consider that it would be practicable to attempt to follow both courses simultaneously. MR. SKAL then explained that he | felt that it was important that this lightship should not fall under Persian control* it constituted an important route Xibht' on which the safety of His Majesty’s ships and merchant shipping might depend. The Persians could not be relied upon to run such a light efficiently - at any rate for more than two or three years. The Admiralty would he thought therefore like to move the lightship outside Persian f territorial waters, and indeed outside even the six-mile limit claimed by Persia. They were advised that this would be physically possible, and that they could thus retain control of the lightship. it was suggested however that it would be somewhat invidious to remove the lightship in this way immediately on the eve of the proposed negotiations* It would probably have a very bad effect on any negotiations if they were to be preceded by such a measure. Mr. Beal realised the force of these arguments and expressed the opinion that the Admiralty might be prepared to allow the s Asians to take over the lightship but only If a watertight agreement in respect of dues could be obtained in exchange. 14. ng14. MB. BEAX* developing hie argument further, «ent on to ea^phaeiee the distinction between the ’*port M and w route*' light# The former were raerely at local concern, and could be handed over to the Persians without any ill effect - assuming, that is, that the Persians would be content to pay for them by collecting dues at each port. The route lights, on the other hand, were a matter of international importance, in connexion with which the Government of India had virtually assumed a twofold obligation «* namely to maintain a reliable service, wu* to charge reasonable dues. it would be difficult to justify before other interested Powers a complete abdication of this position. He thought that it might be justifiable to hand over the llghtfhip to the Persians, if in return we could secure a recognition of the obligation to charge reasonable dues; but he felt that any other policy would lead to inferior service at greatly enhanced cost and would be difficult to justify to other Interested parties. MR. tAITHWAlTR said that it was accepted that we could not maintain route or other lights in Persian territorial waters without Persian consent* If, because of Persian action it now became isposaible for us to maintain such lights, he did not see that the Government of India or His Majesty’s Government could be blamed — the responsibility would rest with the Persians* «R. REM BEE pointed out that the Persians having claimed all the lights in their territory and territorial water® *oula certainly not accept the suggestion that Kis Majes^y ^ Government should retain control of the route lights, and that such a suggestion would only lead to a dispute aud woui lead to no settlement. CAPTAIN JACKBGN stated it was v doubtful/16./ doubtful whether the Qai. light ve.eel, although part of the Mis route lighting, wee really absolutely eascntial to the pegulremeats of navigation* 15. GQWmmn mcmm then explained that the Adairalt^ were apprehensive that the Persians, ahile negotiations were still going on, might attempt to remove and talcs possession of the lightship, which would mean that His mjesty'a Oovemraent wouiu lose an asset worth something like £10,000 and that the Haval authorities in the Gulf would he placed In a vw difficult position. i©re the sloops to he authorised to defend British property from theft, by force if necessary? MR* HH?* replied that if the lightship was in fact British property, as find hitherto been assumed, the Persians could not legally do this, and that by doing so they would put the see Ives cut of court. The Admiralty Representatives were inclined to take the view that this would not deter the Persians, or enable His MajestyGovernment to recover the lightship if it were seised, but the point led Mr. arias haw to raise the question whether the lightship and the other lights and buoys in question were legally British property or not. He pointed out that they had now been moored for wy years to Persian soil and that the Persian Government •ifht conceivably contend that they had become Persian* Mo ona was able to throw any light on the precise legal position, or evert on the question whether the lightship ilew any * *8B manned by a crew of any particular nationality* It speared that the lightship was almost entirely automatic and that it was only occasionally visited by the personnel of the administration.16. It agreed that if there wan in fact any loan as to the legal ownership of these lights and buoys and of the lightship, the course which had at first been suggested, by which Colonel lard should attempt to negotiate ilth the competent Persian authorities an agreement for the sale of this material, could no longer be pursued, and that the beat course would be to remove the material as soon and as completely as could be done with due regard to the safety of navigation. The view was generally tehen that since these lights and buoys and the lightship had been paid for by Fie Majesty’s Government or the Government of India, snd placed in their present positions end subsequently aaintained wholly at British expense, the arguments for contending that they were in fact British (or Government of India) property probably conclusive. It was agreed, however, that the foreign Office should consult their Legal Advise re on this point a© soon m possible. It was noted that the history of the establishment of the present lighting and buoying system in the Gulf is given in &amp;om detail on Pages im to 144 of 7.G.15, 17, it was eventually agreed, subject to the rider given telow and subject to the approval of the higher authorities concerned and to the concurrence of the Government of India, that, provided that it could be established that the lights •nd buoys administered by Colonel ward were In fact British (or Government of Indie) property, ® telegram should be sent to Mr. Kbatchbull Hugesaen in the following sense i- Ke should be authorised to reply to the Persian Government ® the general lines suggested in paragraph S of his telegram s ®*168, but in the following modified form, i.e. that His Majesty’s/Hajesty'a Ooverrmmt agrea to the Peretaa propose that the Persian Oovemac-nt should a 68tMe reeponaihuity for lighting and buoying within their territory and territorial waters in for his own confidential information, 0 f the reasons why Hie yajeaty’s Ooveraaent preferred to leave the preparation of such a list to Colonel Sard during his discussions with the Persian authorities concerned* Colonel Ward would, however. | be asked to ascertain from the Persians what their intentions were, both as regards the existing lights and buoys within their territory and any new lights and buoys which they propped to establish within that Territory. Mr. Hugessen eould then go on to inform the Persian Government that Hie Majesty 1 * Government consider that careful preliminary eoaeuitet xgfn will be necessary between the new Persian lighting authorities and Colonel Ward, not only as to the necessary security for shipping during the transfer, but also ae to the precise terms on which the property involved should be transferred to the Persian Government.

Yours sincerely”7 11th December, 1934 , Dear Baggalley, , / j Thank you for your tter of the 8th December (E 7333/1662/34 ) enclosing a draft record of our meeting on Thursday last about lights and buoys the Persian Coast. I return one of the two copies of the draft record which you enclosed. You will see that Captain Brandon and I have suggested certain alterations. As regards those relating to the list of lights etc. which was laid before the meeting, perhaps you will, if you are in any doubt about Captain Brandon’s suggested alterations in paragraphs 2 and 3, communicate with him direct. As regards my alteration in paragraph 12, vis., the sue sti tut ion of ”as soon as possible” for 'when the time came', Captain Brandon and I are certainly under the impression that ^r. Rendel agreed that Colonel Ward r Baggallay, Esq ., Foreign Office, S.W.l.should have the points as to dues, raWd w iaisea oy me a t the meeting, put to him as soon as possible, 1 e in connection with the negotiations with the Persians which he will, if possible, be asked to undertake almost immediately. As the phrase r, when the time came” seems to imply the postponement of the raising of this point to some indefinite future date, T hope that my alteration will be agreed to. As regards my addition to paragraph 17, this point was not mentioned at the meeting, but T hope that it will form part of the instructions to Colonel Ward. In the telegram. No.167, from Teheran of the 25th November, it is stated that plans are being made by the Persians 'to instal new lights and buoys in suitable places and to assure existing lighting arrangements”. In view of this I hope that the Foreign Office will agree to my addition to paragraph 17 and act accordingly. If the Persians have, as stated, plans all ready we ought to know, as soon as possible of what they consist so that we here should know where we are. Finally/Finally as regards the remarks by the Admiralty representatives on the question of the removal of the light vessel at Sals, would you kindly note that If and when the possibility of the removal of this vessel becomes a matter for decision, the Board of Trade, in the interests of British shipping, would like to he given an opportunity of expressing their views on it.

Paragraph 3.

They consist of one lightship off Qais Island (valued by Co lonel Ward in 1931, at approximately 158,000 rupees, i.e. about £10,000), a flashing light at Henjam, a group flashing light and a stone beacon at Jask, and three lighted and six unl\ghted floating buoys, which (especially the lighted buoys) are of considerable value. All of these seamarks except the stone beacon at Jask could be removed - the buoys without any difficulty.

After the second sentence concluding with the words 'Persian Authorities concerned*, insert the following sentence 'Colonel lard would, however, be asked to ascertain from the Persians what their intentions were both as regards the existing lights and buoys within their territory and any new 15 ghts and buoys which they proposed to establish within that territory'. Paragraph 18. In the last sentence substitute 'to' for the word 'with'.zrs Mr. Walt Please see Tehran telegrams of 25th and 26th November on P.Z.7338/34, about the Persian request that the management of lights ana buoys in Persian territory and territorial waters should be handed over to them. This was discussed at a meeting at the Foreign Office on 6 th December, a preliminary uncorrected record of which is below. As you will see, the meeting felt that we could not resist this Persian demand, so far at any rate as indisputable Persian areas were concerned, and that in these circumstances the best course would be to deal with it on the lines suggested in paragraph 3 of Mr. Hugessen’s telegram 168 of 26th November, and to handle the question of material on a business basis - that we should, in other words, give the Persians the option of taking over the material at a fair valuation or of replacing it within a reasonable time by buoys, etc. of their own, on the arrival of which we should remove our equipment. The vexed question of dues was raised by the Board of Trade (it/1 Hi (it* is so ox consiaeTable interest* t*o Inciia)*. Tbe general feeling of tne meeting on this was that there was little hope, given our experience of the Persians, of endeavouring to strike a bargain with them under which, e.g., we should leave equipment in situ in return for an undertaking on their part not to impose dues beyond a certain level, and that the most that could be done was that Colonel Ward, if the discussions at Tehran in which it is suggested that he should participate as an expert materialise, should explore the position of the Persians and if possible lead them in the right direction. 2. It was made clear that India are directly (indeed principally) concerned ana must be consulted before any instructions are sent to the Minister. I have sent Mr. Caron an advance uncorrected copy of the minutes by 4@-4a^i&amp;'-air mail with a view to facilitating consideration once we make an official reference, but we cannot make an official reference unt il; (a)/ ICa) the Foreign Office have pronounced as to the local status of the qai 3 lightship; (h) the Admiralty nave made up their minds as to whether they desire that the lightship should at once he removed from territorial waters lest it should fall into Persian hands; and (c) agreement has heen reached as to tne minutes of the meeting. 3. But there are two points on which I agreed that we should telegraph and we can dispose of these at once. ,It is important to loss as little time as possible,, lest the Persians should forestall us and either provoke an incident by endeavouring to take over material, or require us to remove our own material to make place for material which they have procured themselves from elsewhere. 4. I attach a draft to tne Government of India.a ~ for lighting and buoying arrangeawnte In the Gulf, ana that it woulu be necessary to secure tueir concurrence in any instructions to be sent to the iOaister. 2. Ibe minutes in their final form i^y differ considerably from the draft no* enclosed, but l do not tninic there will be any difference of substance. 4. i am sending a copy of this letter and of its «ncio sure to rdwle.

Partial acquiescence which it would involve might pro duce temporary contentment and should afford ample occupation thus encouraging the hope that questions in ( 3 ) (i) above would not be raised immediately, though I fear this is some- what optimistic* 00 however, questions in (B) (1) are then raised I would suggest replying as regards Tainh that our attitude has long been known to the Persian Government and has only recent ly been defined to them again in the clearest terms (your telegrams 91 to 93) and. that His Majesty’s Government cannot admit any claim on the p&amp;vt of Persian Government to manage lighthouses on territory which does not belong to them. As regards hooka Channel we might answer that this is a matter ior Persian Government to discuss with Iraqi Government 0 I doubt the likelihood of Persia raising Bahrein in this con nexion as I understand their experts did not attempt to examine the lights there. But if they did we could reply on the seme lines as Tamb and as to (B) (2) above I think we raust remain firm against any extravagant Persian claim regarding territorial waters and adhere to attitude cefinea K , in cur note of July 16th (Tehran despatch no. 543).

As to B (3) there would inevitably be risk but matter of dues might arise in negotiations in connerdon with transfer of control or in wider connexion dealt with in succeeding paragraph. * 8 . Above suggestions are, however, subject to further considerations as to importance of maintaining unity of Gulf and Shatt-al-Arab lighting and buoying system (your telegram &lt;- No. 102 of June 30th, 1933). I understood when in Bagdad last week that Iraqi Government are contemplating early reference to the League of Iraqi-Persian frontier question. In the event of a League decision favourable to Iraq the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board would assume increased im portance to Persian Government as a working solution of Shatt-el-Arab question and could be proposed to tnem by Iraqi Government in more favourable circumstances. If we could postpone a definite reply to present Persian claim at least until Iraqi Government had made known their intendon to refer frontier question to Geneva it might be poosJole tablish a connexion between the two questions and Persian Government to join in solution winch would rm needs as regards unity. It is for consideration how far we could go in making our acquiescence in Persian cla' * seated in paragraph 3 conditional upon claims in general scheme covering Gulf and Shat t - el -Arad &lt; 9. There is, I suppose, some risk that if we ® ^ ^Ply too long Persians will take things into their ^ as they did in the ease of their request for exper 1933, it is even possible that the present y(liberate attempt to forestall P - ■ a - E rovi va], tv Tv, Pn j . , P p™, Rr , , •' 1W11 Government • tonowrvanoy toaia proposals, hi n w . w . .

Doubtless time can he gained by raising question of payment but I do not see that it is possible in present circumstances to prevent issue of Tamb coming to a head. Confirmation of this anticipation is furnished by Senior Naval Officer who has just arrived here by air and informs me that second Persian sloop (see Dushire telegram No. 773 of September 6 th to India Oil ice) arrived at September 11th and sent boat ashore 'to look for invisible deserter'* Officer Commanding who displayed some reluctance exchange* normal calls informed HoM.b.

Z. Will you be good enough to pass on the two spares to India and Bushire? Copies have been sent to Bagdad for communication to Ward at Basrah and Watkinson at Ahwaz. The Department of Overseas Trade have not, I should explain, been able to have the map copied yet, as it is rather complicated and has been in constant use for circulation to the various interested British firms. It will be copied as soon as possible. 3. It has, of course, been obvious for some time past that the Persians were bent on taking over /eventually Laithwaite, Esq.eventually the lighting of their own coast, and that we should not oe aole to stop them. Meanwhile the acquisition of a proper system of lights for their new port seenio an inevitable and harmless development and we do not suppose that it will matter much that the lights thus acquired will be visible to shipping approaching the Shat t-el-Arab.

The notice stated that specifications and plans could be obtained from the Ministry of Communications on payment, so we have obtained a set at a cost of Rials fifty. Owing to public holidays, however, we have not been able to obtain the set until to-day and there is no time to copy the specifications or reproduce the plan (which is signed by Monsieur xCindt, the Banish engineer) before the bag closes this evening. We have accordingly agreed with the Commercial Secretariat that they shall send the original to the D.O.T. (see Tehran despatch! No. O.T.(B) 49 of March 24th) in case any British firms wish to tender and that we shall at the same time write to you to asm you to arrange for the specifications and plans to be copied as soon as possible and copies sent to the Port of Basrah authorities m cnarge of and buoys on the Persian coast, and to tne other recipients of copies of this letter.

Sir, Mr. Mallet to Sir John Smon.~(Received December 5.) TTA VF, tbft hnnnnr* fr* fr«onc.Tvn' 4 - Tehran, November 17,1933. IT’ - I am for the moment somewhat at a loss how to interpret this note. It carefully avoids any admission of a special British interest in the lights on the Persian coast, as was perhaps only to be expected, but, on the other hand, it suggests that no change is going to be made in the existing arrangements, which is eminently satisfactory. I should go further and say that it stated definitely that no change was to be made were it not for the reference to a £{ plan.” On the other hand, again, the final paragraph suggests that the Persian Government may intend to supervise these lights themselves henceforward. 4. It is probable that this note, like the notes about the searching of Arab dhows, the visit to Tamb, &amp;c., would have done more to meet our wishes but for the state of feeling created by the arrest of the mudir of customs at Basidu. Until relations are normal again I do not think it would be judicious to ask the Persian Government to be more precise as to their future intentions. In any case it may be better to let the matter rest, at any rate until such time as some progress can be made by the Iraq Government towards inducing the Persian Government to agree to the establishment of the Tripartite Conservancy Board. 5. I am not sure what international protocol the Persian Government have in mind (unless it be Section III (13) of the Final Act of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea), and should be grateful for a copy of any instrument dealing with this subject. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, the Hon. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire (No. 209), His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 89), the senior naval officer in the Persian Gulf (No. 122 M), and to His Majesty’s consul, Ahwaz (No. 94).

[999 e—6]PERSIA. 8094 November 21 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 11 , L iS 7108/3062/34] No. 1. (No. 498.) Mr. Mallet to Si?’ John Sim,on.—(Received November 21 .) 2. The argument used in the third paragraph is logical to a certain extent but only on the assumption that the oral engagement undertaken by the Persian Government not to disturb the status quo cannot apply to the Island of Tamb. The reason given in the fifth paragraph for excluding the island from the scope of this agreement, that “ Persian officials have always gone there,” has no basis of fact of which I am aware, apart from the incident of August 1928 (see annual report f or 1928, pa ra.gra.phs 147 to 155). 3. The refusal to admit a comparison with the Island of Sirri has no rational basis, inasmuch as His Majesty’s Goverment equally claim that Tamb is the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah, both de facto and de jure. The quotation from the Legation notes of the last three years regarding the visits of H.M.S. Ormonde to Sirri is not quite correct. What was said in each case was that mention was made of the proposed visit because the island was in the de facto occupation of Persian customs officials. 4. The reply to the charge of discourtesy takes no note of the fact that all the visits to lights on the Persian coast took place before any reply had been • 1 t r • i c* _ _ _ * i 3 guidance. 5. Unless previous developments have rendered any further communication to the Persian Government regarding the status of Tamb superfluous by the time this despatch has been considered, I suggest that I should reply reiterating the view of His Majesty’s Government that Tamb is de facto eaad de jure the property of the Sheikh of Ras-ul-Khaimah; that at the time of the incident the Persian Government, whatever their own views as to the status of the island might be, were bound by a ‘‘gentleman’s agreement,” which they had not until then repudiated, not to take any steps to alter the status quo at places like Tamb; that the Persian non Inn firm that there has been no violation of this agreement because Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty s Chaige ff (Translation.) le Charge d’Affaires, ONE of the questions alludec 23rd September, 1933), which I 8 th October, 1933) to reply, was October 21, 1933.

In respect of the first point, taking into consideration the information which vou have as to the views and statements of and the proofs (adduced by) the Imperial Government regarding the ownership of the said island, no objectim can be taken to the visit of the Palang to that place, since at a time when the officials of the Imperial Government were engaged in inspecting all the light houses on the Persian coasts, they could not rightly abstain from inspecting the lighthouse on the Island of Tamb, which they consider their indisputable property and an integral part of their territory 4 . The question of the visit of the survey ship Ormonde to the Island of Sirri, which you quote as an example, cannot be compared with this case, since the Persian Government consider the Island of Tamb de jure and de facto to be their property. . . 5 . With regard to the Island of Sirri, which, as your esteemed note makes clear, the British Government recognise to be Persian territory de facto, but in regard to which they consider the de jure rights of Persia open to question, I find it my duty to inform you that my Government have always considered, and still consider, this island as^ their property de jure and de facto. 6 . As regards the observance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf, the interpretation which you propound in this connexion is not agreed to by the Persian Government, nor does it apply to this case, since the officials of the Persian Government have always gone there and have always considered, and still consider, the said island as Persian territory de facto.( l ) 7. With regard to the fact that, as yon consider, the visit made to the lighthouse in question without previous information being given was at any rate discourteous, I find it necessary to inform you that, in connexion with all light houses and buoys, representations have recently been made to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, with the request that necessary instructions may be given to the competent officials to afford the required facilities to the naval experts of the Imperial Government in the performance of their duties, and that you have, in that part of your esteemed note, mentioned this request of the Imperial Government. Therefore I do not think that any discourteous conduct has occurred in this respect. I avail, &amp;c.

Sb at “ mtervlew I had 2 . Feroughi is evidently much obsessed with this question, which he regards as the mam obstacle to better relations with Iraq. I do not encourage Mm to air ms grievances about Iraq to me, but when such questions as the behfviouNnhe Persian navy are under discussion between us it is difficult to prevent him from turning the conversation to this topia On this occasion I had been rehearsing tS whole catalogue of misdeeds of the Persian navy in the hope of persuading him that Major Bayendor was not a fit person to be Senior Naval Officer and I happened to mention the dangerous manner in which Persian men-of-war navigated the ohatt-el-Aiab. I asked his Highness whether in this connexion he had received a report from the Persian Charge d’Affaires of the conversation mentioned in your despatch, and Feroughi replied in the affirmative. From this he launched out into the sad story of Persia’s grievances in the Shatt-el-Arab Everything depended upon the interpretation of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum, which made over the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab to Persia and gave the Persians complete liberty of navigating the river, but did not state that the waters of the river were dehnitely to be Turkish territorial waters. On this, the 1913-14 frontier settlement was drawn up, but the Persian Government had never accepted it and considered it entirely unfair to Persia. His Highness went on to declare that Persia had no desire to grab fresh territory from the young nation of Iraq. Demonstrating his argument with an ashtray which lay between ns, he said : cc For me to take this ashtray and say it is mine, and for you to snatch it back and say ‘No, it is mine,’ would be a merely childish way to behave.

Sheyesteh said that he had passed on to the Ministry of War our e q as to the expert’s identity, but the latter had replied that as it was only a qu of inspecting lights on Persian territory, the matter was a purely 111 d n and it was scarcely necessary to ££ trouble ” the Legation with the exper s ^ We both agreed that this was a strange reply in view of the previous re j,q. ae , ^ assistance.

I said i business of ours, but it might be worth ascertaining whether the expert wa q ^ independent or the representative of some construction company, wiiose object would be contracts. Sheyesteh thought this a great idea 4. We then got on to the main issue. I explained as well as ^^° d ^Q U if necessary it was for the safety and convenience of the vessels navigating ^ that the navigation guides should be maintained on a uniform system ° p its coasts and waters; and that it was for this reason that we weie ^ anxious that before putting into effect any recommendations made by t eif eat % ] ^n\t muii )in?i o. the Persian Government should discuss these recnmmar.a ,• Basra authorities.

I was not concerned for the moment with the ways in which co-operation could be achieved, but only to urge that before making any changes the Persian Government should consult the Port of Basra authorities. 6 . Sheyesteh said that personally he thought onr point of view entirely reasonable, and would see that it was adequately presented to the Ministry of War. He rather gave the impression that he had not studied the question much hitherto, but would now take it up seriously. At the beginning of onr conversa tion he had complained of the amount of work which the charge of two Departments (he still had the European and American Sections) gave him. U1 August 28, 1933. L.

It will he remembered that at the beginning of June the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the British Charge d’Affaires that the Persian Covernment were considering making arrangements for the management of beacons and shore of the Persian Culf light-houses on the s i rt bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, an and on the left bank oi Port authorities (who . . ..bat the Basra Port auu requested that r,nf and Shatt-el-Arao xab run the Persian Gulf . a tn assist the Persian expert ml( . h t be instructed to as. ^ g . f the lights in Question. in his examination o for rprred to the Foreign Oftic Mr .Mallet referred r b,.t chiefly owing to the instructions but, ./Of times that these instructions had to be redrafted in London, he did not get his reply in to the Persian Government's request until 5th August, two months after it had been made. The reply stated that so far as the Gulf was concerned H.M.G. gladly agreed to show the Persian expert the lights situated in Peisian territory or waters, but suggested that the expert’s visit should be put off until the end of September when Colonel Ward, the Basra Port Director, would himself be available to explain the system; as regards the Shatt-el - Arab it was explained that the Persian Government would have to apply direct to the Iraq Government for any facilities. The reply ended with an expression of hope that H.M.G. would in any case be consulted if the Persians contemplated any change in the lighting arrangements and a reminder that the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board had already been suggested as a suitable body to control the lighting system. Ho sooner had Mr.Mallet’s note been delivered to the Persian Government than we received a report from the Political Resident that a French lighting expert had already visited j Hen jam on behalf of the Persian Government on 23rd July. in view of this new situation instructions were sent to the Gulf that the French expert should be given facilities to visit lights Persian soil or in Persian waters but that any possible steps should be taken to prevent him isiting any of the Arab lights, particularly Tamb. Shortly afterwards, however, (17th August) we heard that/ (9 2 f l - uro (it* t 33dinute Paper. Department. on 1712b 5000 3.33 fats that the French expert had already visited Tamb uu the same day as Henjam. Mr.Mallet was instructed to protest against this flagrant violation of the status gjao and it will be remembered that we received h* from the Persians * fairly satisfactory^apolog* for * the incident. The expert returned to Tehram about the middle of September to make his report to the Persian Government. According to information recently received his itinerary in the Gulf appears to have included Kais Light Vessel (18th July), Tamh and Henjam (23rd July), Charbar^about the end of July), Kharag Island (beginning of August), finishing at Muhammerah in September. Mr .Mallet, who had never been informed by the Persian Government about the Frenchman, was instructed to make an oral protest regarding the sendm 0 expert to Henjam without notice, and on 23rd August he addressed another note to the Persian Minister of , „ + i.

This uneasiness was expressed by Mr.Laithwaite at the meeting held on 11th August (see Flag K). It appears, however, that there is little likelihood of the Conservancy Board negotiations being resumed in the near future, since both the Persians and the Iraqis have other preoccupations and it is in any case likely that the Persians will make another attempt to secure a revision of frontier before considering^fhe Conservancy Board proposals. As will be remembered, Sir Francis Humphrys is very much against H.M.G. taking the initiative in the negotiations. Should the Conservancy Board project come to nothing, or should the Persians decide to take over themselves the management of the lighting system in Persian territory it may be necessary to fall back upon Sir Hugh Biscoe’s n n +- two decker scheme or some variant thereof for the management of the lights.

Dear Warner, Thanks for yours of the 19th enclosing draft record of meeting at the Foreign Office on the 11th inst. about the Persian Gulf. The record is very well done and I have only one small point to raise on it. I mentioned at the meeting that it as of some importance to us to ascertain who exactly the French expert was and particularly with what French Company he was connected. We want, of course, to know definitely whether , as we susoect, he is connected with the Ottoman Lighthouse Company. This might be recorded in the note by slightly expanding the paragraph numbered 3 towards the end of the note beginning 'The Foreign Office would also instruct H.M. Charge d' Affaires at Tehran by telegraph aubordinate official'. The sentence following these words might read 'and at the same time to entire what UWarner, Esq.; £ Il0l{ l the French expert’s plans were, what was his name and the name of the French Company on whose behalf he was acting*. I see that in Telegram 122 to M llet, dated l?th ingt you did ask him to seek from the Persian Government *’ in format! regarding Expert and his progranme 5 '.

There were present Mr. C.P.A. Warner Foreign Office .(in the Chair) I Mr. Grimshaw Board of Trade Mr. Laithwaite India Office Captain Jackson) \ Mr. SSeal ) Mr. Lascelles Foreign Office i Admiralty The meeting had Before them telegram No. 88 of the 6 th August from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and telegram Ho. 168 of the 9th August from His Majesty's ChargS d 'Affaires at Tehran. &lt; The first point to he considered was the possibility of taking action to confine the investigations of the French lighting expert „H+.mn harmless limits. general id \ \the Shatt el~Arah; hut .that all possible steps should he taken to prevent him from inspecting the lights on the Arah mauilano. and islands, and, in particular, the position of the frontier is doubtful* The foregoing instructions were to he couched in ■«V general terms, and full discretion was to he left to the Political Resident (who would, of course, take action in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer and the Basra Port • ' -! ' I ■ : . 1 Directorate) as to the precise nature of the action to he taken for warning the lighthouse keepers concerned* Mfi—Grimshaw raised the question whether there general instructions to the effect that the expert should he allowed to examine (and in fact could not he hindered from examining) all lights on Persian territory and in Persian territorial waters outside lighthouse at Tamb, which Persia claims, and the lights in the Rooka Channel, where thethere were not certain lights on the Persian coast which were outside the ordinary three-' mile limit of territorial waters, but within the seven-mile limit which the Persian Government were understood to claim. It was generally agreed, subject to further investigation, that there were no lights of importance in 'this category. The next question to be discussed was how far the position revealed in the two telegrams before the meeting necessitated a modification of the attitude previously adopted by His Majesty's Government with regard to the general question of the future control of lighting in the Shatt-el-Arab and in the Persian Gulf. T.fiithwaite said that, speaking without definite instructions, he would like to enter a caveat regarding the future attitude of Board~-z£ Board scheme as already proposed to the Iraq.! and Persian Governments. In discussing that scheme in the past, it had always heen hoped and assumed that the practical control of the whole system would devolve on a British naval officer,whose technical qualifications would place him in a position of superiority vis-S-vis of hie Persian and Iraqi colleagues. If, however, ■ as now seemed possible, the Persian representative on the Board were to he advised and prompted by a Frenchman versed in the technical problems involved, the position would have radically changed, and it would probably be much more difficult to confine the activities of the Persians to. their own side of the Gulf and prevent them from interfering on the Arab coast. The &lt; Vvc tfvy^v late Lieutenant-Colonel Bisooe's rejected 'two-decker' scheme, involving a subordinate Board for the exclusive control of the Arab lights Lvv (A/y—C-'V if- w Mf f (WiCwould te prominently towards solving thought, should go Laithwai ctifficul'ki 63 After lights, might then have to he reconsidered on its merits as an alternative to the existing proposals. MEs—§. ea l, observed that as the French Company would consider it a sine qua non to make a large profit, there was little danger of their taking any part in the Conservancy Board scheme, if this should ever materialize. Mr« Laithwaite « on the other hand, thought that representatives of the French Company might well try to make trouble hy playing on the vanity of the Persian and Iraqi representatives, encouraging them to comhine and thus to outvote the British Member on the Board. My». ftrlmshaw reminded the meeting that in correspondenoe the possibility had previous been envisaged of securing that the actual work of the Board should be delegated to an Advisory 1 Committee on which British shipping interests sented. be 4Aftep a further discussion of* these points it was generally agreed that for the present at any rate, the existing Conservancy Board scheme must still he regarded as preferable to any other, and the only immediate problem was therefore how best to secure its acceptance by the Persians In reply to an enquiry by Mr« Seal as to the probable chances of bringing the Persians* into line, Mr* Warner thought that the prospects could not be said to be particularly good* When the scheme was originally proposed to the Persian Government in the spring of 1952, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs had been definitely hostile to it, and it was Teymourtache, now in disgrace, who had shown himself relatively favourable and had prevented its definite ejection. ihe .^hah, too, had apparently indicated to King Pei sal that he saw advantage in the scheme, hut Sir Francis Humphrys had said ^ u| ( V OjlJ wjsaid that conversations between the two Sovereigns could not be relied upon as they understood each other very imperfectly. Everything pointed to the fact that the Persian Government were now intent on pressing for a rectification of the frontier in the Shatt, and it seemed unlikely that they would * entertain the Conservancy Board Scheme, until they saw that frontier rectification could not he obtained. On the question of tactics, Mr* Wsrflgr recalled that Sir Francis Humphrys, when last in London, had been insistent that His Majesty's Government should remain in the background and leave merits of the scheme. the Iraqis to urge the The interests of His Majesty's Government in the Shatt-el-Arab were ayinhle. but it could not c ertainly very con was compara'ble 2 , and the historicalchance of securing acceptance of the Conservancy Board scheme would he considerably better once the treaty negotiations had got under way* Mr* Laithwaite and Mr* Grimshaw were also in favour of proceeding with caution and not ’’pushing” the Conservancy Board scheme at this stage. Mr. Grimshaw said he was anxious to ascertain what the position would be if the worst came to the worst and the French company were to obtain a concession and start charging heavy dues. Where could they collect these dues, and how much could they collect? m,. Warner thought that as regards the rate of the charges, the only limit tou1 imposed when It became unprofitable for foreign „UU « °f l 1 ** 1 ' '■ 11 ' Persian shipping- the meeting agreed, as there was practically no As regards the ports at which the Persian dues could be . „ an d Bu shire levied, Ahadan an » would probably be sufficient for the purposesof the ComplyCompany. After further discussion it was agreed that competent advice on these points should he obtained from the Anglo-Per si an Oil Company or from the Bombay Advisory Committee; of these, the latter would be difficult to approach without revealing prematurely too much of the Conservancy Board proposals, and it would, therefore, be preferable for. the Foreign Office to approach 3ir B. Kemball Cook of the Anglo Persian Oil Company with whom they had been in touch on similar questions before. The discussion then turned to the best way of 'shepherding' the French expert pending the return of Colonel Ward to the Gulf. The conclusion was reached that Colonel s/ard # now on leave in Bagdad c i'o,- 1 c hoalfi t., consulted as to whether one of his subordinates on the Port Directorate could ^ Se0 ° nded f0r purpose; and that he shoui be asked to send this subordinateinstructions, especially as regards the avoidance as far as possible of awkward areas bixeli aa uhe Hooka channel. The Foreign Office could then cause the Iraqi Government to be approached through His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad with a view to securing their official consent for the seconding of the official in question* Meanwhile* it was clearly imperative to find out more about the expert’s present plans and also desirable to ascertain whether the Persian Government had yet approached the Iraqis in the mtter of the lights in the shatt-el-Arab. The political Hesident a‘ and His Majesty's Charge d'affaires at Tebr^ should also be .

An inconclusive discussion followed regarding the possibility of claiming compensation in the event of the Persian Government deciding to take over the lights in Persian waters* or* alternatively* of removing e the moored lights and lightships and the fitti etc. from the fixed shore lights. Mr^ Laithwaite pointed out that contrary to the general belief, Persia had agreed, in some ca^es at least* to the establishment of these lights in Persian waters and on Persian soil, and the position was consequently not quite analogous to that of the wireles s stations.r for the establishment of whipv, *, which no permission had been obtained. During the course of the meeting ^ laithwaite suggested that as the Persians might eventually reject both the Conservancy Boaro. schame and the ^ two-decker' 1 Yariant of it* it would he well to ascertain whether a workable scheme could be devised for the control» either quite independently of the Persian system* or in some sort of liaison with it, of the lights in the Shatt-el-Arab and in the non-Persian part ,of the Persian Gulf; and to find out how far such a system would render British shipping independent of the Persian lights if not bound for Persian jt was agreed that the political ports, l^esi&amp;ent should be on this question. ashed to furnish a report lo sum up, therefore, the action agreed on was as follows:- (1)( 1 ) The imreigi Qf^ G g. would 00Ilsult the Basra Port Director regarding the seconding of one of his subordinates to 'shepherd' the French expert, and would ash Colonel Ward to telegraph full instructions to -the subordinate chosen by him for this purpose. r (&amp;) Thereafter, the Foreign Office would seek formal permission from the Iraqi Government* through H^is Majesty , s Embassy at Bagdad, for the seconding of this official, instructing Mr* Ogilvie- Forbes to ascertain at the same time whether the Persian Government had approached the Iraqi Government regarding the inspection of the lights in the Shatt-el-Arab. (3) The Foreign Office would also instruct Hi a Majesty *s pharg6 d*Affaires at Tehran by telegraph to offer the Persian Government the services of thisr J subordinate offir-ioi * 10ial * 8114 at the same time to enquire what the Frenrt , ffrenoh e ^ert- s plans were. (4) KMlSi^Offiee would sound sir B.

(5) The India Office would telegraph to the Government of India (repeating to the Political Resident at Bushire) suggesting that Colonel loch should receive instructions regarding the lights which the French expert might he allowed to examine, and that he should maice enquiries locally regarding the expert's immediate programme. would also request (6) mhP.

The Resident's telegram suggests that the Persians have moved more quickly than had been anticipated in regard to future arrangements for Persian lights and huoys and that a French expert has actually arrived in the.Gulf for the purpose of advising them. The question of the action to he taken was considered at an interdepartmental conference at the Foreign Office yesteraay attended by this Office, Board of Trade and Admiralty, at which the following conclusions were reacnea:- (a) That in view of the weakness of our position legally we had better (as had hitherto been the I A 1 , id ■ ! of all the authorities concerned) grant 171 2b 5000 3/33 general sense -- — f „ Titles for the inspection ol with a good grace fucili t in Persian territorial waters any lisnts or Ouoya „ Kls , . to (Henjnrn, Basiau, Busnrro.

The basic assumption has in the past been that as neither the Persians nor the Iraqis would know anything about the technical details of Culf lighting, effective control would in fact rest with H.iw.G. as represented by the naval officer, and that H.M.G. could in these circumstances be able to secure satisfactory conduct of lighting and ouoying arrangements for the Gulf as a whole without any riok of interference by other members of the Board, main arguments in favour of action on ^ese so long as there was no risk of Persian or Iraqi interference with the Arab coast, are (1) Ihe general desirability of retaining the unified system which has worked so well for many years past ana .fch nas been built up by - H j n. a continued foothola in respect of the ensure H.h-.G ^ ^ ^ judication, Shatt-al-Arab• ^ igft oUt)for a British were the rest of the chairman/—6&gt; — 7 c 1U P&lt;A*i0^i 7^75^' K chairman or even a British member of the.

I suggested s.t tne meeting yesterdiiy tliut tdQ latest developments might make it necessary for us to reconsider our attitude towards the Conservancy Board project, ^t the moment the Persians appear to Pe far from enthusiastic about it. ft, however, they aid in fact accept it and were to appoint a frenchman as their representative on the Board, or if, alternative the Persian member of the Boara were to be officially advised by a representative of an expert French corporation, the chances of our maintaining control of lighting and buoying arrangements might be very substantially lessened. Apart from this, there might be much more danger of the Persians, unaer the inspiration of the foreign expert, endeavouring to interest themselves actively in lighting and buoying arrangements on the opposite side of the Gulf. Finally, there was the risk that with a foreign expert representing a second Oriental country the British member of the Board might find himself outvoted by an Iraqi-Persian combination on occasions when relations oetween this country and Iraq were strained. The meeting agreed that this was the case. discussed tentatively possible action in the event of the Persians pressing their claim to run lights, e uc. in Persian territorial waters entirely eir own. it was agreed that the matter must be examined m greater detail, probably in the light of a e to tne resident and the Government of India, r t in that event our lirst objective might be to arrange for the running of the shatt lights jointly those of the rest of the Gulf by a British-Iraqi ' a to work possibly in liaison with the Persians, Ut t0 C ° ntaln n ° representative!

As I have told you on the telephone, I have heard from ^Ward that he hopes to see Yasin Pasha, uhe Iraqi Minister responsible, on Monday morning at 10.30, and unless he lets me know that this proves impossible, I am expecting yo representatives of the Admiralty and Board of irade at 12 o’clock to meet him. ^ w— COPY SENT BY A!R MAIL n v AIR MAIL • ■ ■ ) , r y / ■ ►Laithwaite, Ssg.30PY (E 3671/3062/34) TOREXGH OFFICE, S.W.l. 13th July, 1933 , Since my conversation with you about ti r, you about the Persian request that their expert should visit the lights on the shore of the Persian Gulf and left ban* of the Shatt-el-Arab, i tove had a further talk with Sir F.Humphrys. As I told you, King Feisal and the Iraqi Ministers who are over here had reacted most unfavourably, when Sir Francis had raised with them earlier the possible advantage of agreeing to show the Persian expert the whole lighting and buoying system in the Shatt-el-Arab as well as in the Persian Gulf. I told Sir Francis that I understood that you were inclined to think that this would be a good plan, (a) as the best means of avoiding the doubtful question of the territorial waters at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab being raised in connexion with the Persian Government expert’s visit, and (b) because it would give you an opportunity of emphasising to the expert that the present system of unified administration was much the mos effective and economical, he appreciated your argument, said that it was not a question on whicn he felt he could . v . ncf ppisal and the Iraqi Ministers return to the cnarge with King ^eis here. He thinks, however, that there might well te advantage in your putting this point to Rustam Beg Haidar (who is, I • •r»rv+ 'f'iiQ.t OX rii ^ understand, your Minister) as your own vrew, ■ ,,, 0 -crested that you might Majesty* s Government.

I understand that it is not yet certain how much longer King Felsal and the Ministers will he staying here; they did propose to leave on Saturday, hut it seems on the whole likely that they will now stay beyond the 30th July. On another point, I should be glad of your confirmation of the impression I got from you that the Port of Basra administration runs the whole lighting and buoying on the Shatt-el-Arab on its own behalf, and that the lights and 'buoys which you run on the behalf of the Government of India are all completely outside the Shatt-el-Arab system. Perhaps you could let me know exactly where the dividing line between the Fort of Basra system and Government of India system comes. As I understand it, we should he correct in replying to the Persian Government's request that the lights main the Government of India are confined to the Persian Sulf proper and do not extend to the Shatt, hut that i ^ crhis on the left His Majesty’s Government know there are torial waters in the hank of the Shatt or in Persian te Shatt. Is this correct?

Sir, I ten directed by the Board of trade to refer to the arrangements under which the lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf are at present maintained, and to state that It appears to them from recent correspondence relating to the proposed tShatt el Arab Conservancy Bo&amp;ra Convention that His Majesty* s Government may at no uistant date have to face tiie possibility of the Persian Government insisting on the transfer to them of that portion of the lighting and buoying service which is on Persian territory, or within Persian territorial waters. r xhe Board now learn from telegrams which were sent to the Foreign Office by His Majesty* s kepresentative at Tehran on the 9th June (Foreign Office reference A. 3063/306^/34) that the Persian Government are proposing to make arrangements for the manageraent of the beacons ana lighthouses on the shore of the Persian *uli ana /bank ider Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.U.l.bunk of tne Uhatt el Arab ana desire that faollltleB ra&amp;y be iven for an expert (who has been appointed; to examine the lights in question. The Board had already regarded with some misgiving the possibility of the lights in question coming directly under Persian management&gt; as this would probably lead to inefficiency and unreliability in their maintenance as well as to the institution of some new charge in the form of light dues in Persian ports, ana would upset the present co-orainateu scheme of lighting in the Chatt el Arab, but they are now disquieted to learn from a note by representatives of this Department who attended a meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 16th June for the purpose of considering Mr. Mallet’s telegrams, that the expert referred to is a representative of Messrs. Barbier, Benard and Turenne, a French firm of lighthouse engineers, who were at one time, /andand may still be Administration, • '-m.*. u u* o Umtt Uth , tou&lt;= Turkish Lighthouses. It is not necessary to remind the Secretary of State of the aim ouUles whioh have by his Majesty’s Government over a i 0 n b p erlod of years owing to the refusal of the lighthouse Company and the Turkish Government who received about a half of the revenue derived from the Turkish light dues, to disclose the accounts of the Lighthouse Administration, or to give proper consideration to the requests made from time to time for reductions in the dues. The Board fear that His Majesty's Government may be faced with the introduction of a similar arrangement in respect of Persian Lighthouses, and they would be glad to learn whether the Secretary of State can hold out any hope that it may be feasible to make strong representatkm possibly in co-operation with other Governments, to the Persian Government on the subject, should it become apparent tnat the French Company have made proposals to the latter Government for the grant of a concession on /lineslinos which will be detrimental to the interests of the shipping community. The Board would suggest the desirability of acquainting i^r• Mallet with the nature of the difficulties experienced in connection with the Turkish concession, with a view to xaIs reporting immediately to the Foreign Office any definite indication that steps are being taken to introduce such a system in Persia. I am to refer to the lengthy correspondence which has passed between the Foreign Office and this Department on the subject of the Red Sea Ligli trio uses and the French Company's Red Sea Lighthouse Concessions of 1S81 and 1899 respectively, and more particularly to your letters of the 7th and 31st August, 1925, (L.4471/181/91). It will be observed that the Concession of 1881, which the Lighthouse Company maintained to be still valid, provided for the erection of lighthouses on the south-east coast of Arabia and in the Persian Gulf as well as in the Red Sea, that one of the sites mentioned is Cguoin island in the /PersianM.01842/33.

Wlth re:r0rQn oe to the interdepartmental meeting on the 16th June about the Persian request that facilities should be granted for a Persian Government expert to inspect the lights, etc*, on the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and the Persian coast of the Persian Gulf, I write to tell you that consequent on Kernel's conversa tion with Sir F. Humphrys, of which Johnstone has given you the gist over the telephone, Rendel and Humphrys have discussed the matter further. Apart from the great importance of securing delay, he considered it highly desirable that Colonel Yfara should personally supervise the expert's inspection o* the lights and beacons. -,ferd, he felt sure, would be able to size up the situation and deal with the expert in the most taotiul and elleotive way, and show him in particular the technical difficulties •G.Iaithwaite, Esq., India Office.of a divinea system of control* Humphrys says that the Persians like and trust Colonel ward, and it would therefore greatly reduce the risk of friction if ward can deal with the matter; on the other hand, 7fard T s subordinates would be quite unsuitable to oarry out this delicate task. On the general question, then, Humphrys suggests that, in replying to the Persians, we should stress the importance of awaiting Ward's return from his forthcoming three months leave before the inspection takes place. AS regards the Iraqi lights, Humphrys maintained his view that His Majesty's Government had no loous standi for intervening between the Persians and the Iraqis on this question, and was convinced that the Iraqis would resent such intervention. At Hendel's previous conversa tion with Humphrys, when the latter expressed the same view on this point, it had been suggested.thays an alternative to our agreeing at once not to make to the Persians any suggestion regarding an inspection by expert of the iraqi lights, Humphrys should^nsult King Peisal and see if t0 a sreepn the middle/middle or Handel's latest conversation with Humphry* on this subject, the latter had an opportunity of going to consult King Feisal and Yassin Pasha, Minister of i’inance, who is over here with him. They both raise strong objection to the idea of the Persian Government expert inspecting any Iraqi lights in the Shatt-el-Arab. Clearly, then, we cannot make the offer, as regards Iraqi lights, which was embodied in the last two sentences of the first paragraph of the draft telegram to Tehran, which wftfr prepared at our meeting. (I should mention that the argument regarding the uncertainty of the extent of Persian and Iraqi territorial waters at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which had influenced the meeting to suggest that it would be well for the Persian Grovernment expert to inspect Iraqi lights in the Shatt-el-Arab, had previously been fully put before Humphrys by Rendel). As regards the final paragraph of the draft telegram, Humphrys entirely agrees with the line taken. 3. I now enclose draft telegram* prepared in the light of the above. We shall be grateful to know as soon as possible whether your Department concur in It- 4 - or hax^e any amendments to suggest, we ought to get a reply off to Mallet very soon. 4.

Conridentlal inromatlon sugsests that the expert will probably be a foreigner. 2 . The history of the Persian Gulf lighting and buoying is given in Mr. Clauson's memorandum of-1928 below. There are obvious arguments in favour of dealing with the lights within and without Persian territorial waters and with the lighting arrangements in the Gulf as a whole, anc a divided control under which the Persians would be responsible for the maintenance and management of the lights on the Persian shore or within Persian territorial waters might prove extremely unsatisfactory in practice. Two/schemes have been put forward in the past with a view to meeting possible demands from the Persians that they should be allowed to take over the control of lighting and buoying in Persian territorial waters - the first that the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board should also deal with lighting and buoying in the Gulf generally; the second that the lighting and buoying should be entrusted to two Boards, the first to be in charge of the 3hatt.el-.rab and, by armngement, in addition, with t e „ +hp p ersl an littoral, the second to lights and buoys on the Per -u 0 -m p deal .its lights edd bw« « ' ^ B “ e ' 3/3.

At the moment the prospects of the 3hatt-el-Arab scheme are far from bright, but it is possible that, if the visit by the Shah to Bagdad next autumn materialises, successful efforts^ might; os made io intsrest him in it. 4. The Foreign Office propose! a meeting on Friday, to be attended by Admiralty, Board of Trade and this Office, to discuss the instructions to be sent to Mr. Mallett. There is no question that if the Persians press their point they can take over the lights and buoys in their territory, certain at any rate of which were erected without their concurrence hy Our position being weak our 'best course is therefore to go so far as possible to meet them, consistently with securing our own interests. In all the circumstances the Foreign Office are disposed to ^ think that we should do best (subject to the observations of the Resident and the Government of India) to return a friendly reply to the immediate request, saying that we shall be delighted to give the expert any facilities that he wants on the Persian shore and the left bank of the y r/b' J (/L Shaft-el-Arab, and ersi-cui « *— fcwsaw ' ‘ ltl a +Y»nr*+.&lt;3d tiO impress ( ’ r -ia hp instructed to impress our own local experts, who cou , . unified contraband the on him the advantage ol a un ^ onlv from the Persian point oi unsatisfactory nature, n on y Persian + .i in an area such as the Persian view, of a dual control iGulf. ___ Persians In laet she. signs ffie Persian Hants Is raises at this sta s e, the i tae Bah ne taken that this .as a complicates matter on-Bich our Governments has been to corresponsence lor a i„ ns tlM ln connection »lth the ahatt-el-Srab cohservanc.

I am rather uneasy about Farsi, Arab!, Harqus and Qran, the indeteminate status of which will he remembered, but on which certain buoys have been placed. We may find it necessary to take a line as to the status of these islands if the expert by any chance wishes to visit them. 6.

The Minister had explained that his Government saw only three ways in which to deal with this question. The first was for 'Iraq, in the Interests of good neighbourly relations, voluntarily to surrender half of the Bhatt to Persia, the second was to refer the question to some suitable International body for arbitration, and the third was to suspend negotiations on this and on all other outstanding matters until the Bhah visited His Majesty in Uraq. 8. The King said that he had impressed on the Persian Minister that the attitude which Nurl Pasha had taken up in this matter was fully supported by the ’Iraqi Government and by himself « The first course which the Minister had suggested should be dismissed as being quite impracticable; the 'Iraqi Government could never eons vital interests. The seeo: 'Iraqi Government could not could never consent to such a sacrifice of their ital interests. The second course was also one to which the Iraqi Government could not agree since they held that their ^ technical/ *e ftlght Honourabletechnical claim to sovereignty over the c, hflt* s vy over the ohatt was indisputable that, in cogence, there was no open question which C ° Uld ^ refe,,re&lt;i ' t0 ^Mtratlon.

These are dealt with below. h Notifications of the various aids to navigation were given from time to time to mariners and in some cases to foreign Consular representatives.

Masthead lights on the Henjam and Chahbar telegraph stations, like those already in existence at Jask, were exhibited in 1914. 8 . In 1913-4 the Political Resident proposed a general overhaul of beacons. The following beacons were to be maintained :—Koweit (Ras-al- Arz), Bushire (Ras-al-Marg), Jask, Henjam and Basidu. New beacons were to be built at Kubbar (near Koweit), Khor Kaliya (near Bahrein) and Halul. That at Halul was to be erected not so much to aid navigation as to establish a foothold against Turkish and German designs; the ownership of the island being, as will be seen from the memorandum on page ||, undecided, though there are some grounds for considering it under Abu Dhabi. All the proposals were sanctioned by the early part of 1914. 9. Later in the same year the question arose of the ownership of certain islands off the coast between Koweit and Bahrein, and, mainly for political reasons, beacons which might help, if necessary, to establish a claim to ownership were sanctioned, and set up in 1915, on the islands of Farsi, 1 Arabi and Harkus. 10. The beacon at Henjam (Ras-al-Mashia) was restored in 1917, and a light placed on it. That at Plalul was removed from charts, &amp;c., on a A-dity. Sept. 28 1928 . report from R.I.M.S.

As this would undermine the British supremacy in matters of lig itrng am nug involve financial difficulties if dues were subsequently levied, it was deci e to drop the project altogether. In 1917, the matter was raised again by he Government of India, who proposed to erect a light without consuUmg i Persian Government; but various delays supervened and it was not till 1923 that the Government, of India stated that they were anxious to pmceed with the construction.

Thus His Majesty s Governme and the Government of India found themselves in exactly the same posit oil as in 1912. Any such scheme for Persian control was strongly deprecate! bv the Secretary of State, though the Government of India were incline to favour it. The Political Resident suggested an alternative light « Nabivu Farm-, but it was decided that, other objections apart, the status the island was such that a prior reference to the Persian Govemuien. u “d be necessary before a light could be established. Ihe question o Sheikh Shuaib lighthouse was accordingly dropped once more. Letter from I.O. to F.O., Aug. 3 1922, P. 2460/22. V.-—-Conclusions. 21. It appears that the lighting and buoying of the Gnlf efficiently carried out since the assumption of responsibility bv the ment of India, and it has been almost entirely to British, activity - a _ larger vessels using the Gulf (of which the overwhelming majon y British) are indebted for the existing aids to navigation. 22. The Persian Government has never been in a position to rnaintam ^ effective service and has never played any constructive part. Ihe pr°P for Persian construction at Sheikh Slraaib and in the Gulf geneia } b IV (/&gt;) and (d)) have been based on the employment of British personae British money. 23. In the Memorandum of the 1st March 1922 to . the United Government the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said :-y“ f he ^ Gulf has for more than a' century been the scene of active British mWyite “H: 1 Pti^, , 8 ^Oferifc illl 'fefl ( leri( it lrraD §®ei| at a per | l - inereFt a of tterti ictediOJia; , it u 4 f ed agiiitt ; coDSilli'^ it was ut ious tip® sl stysW^ the sain# Oilgly (If: diaWf'- irnat ■Toiiinifl'- 'a{W ,: ‘ inf t it tiir and a predominant British tndp P' t trade has been abolished, the waters'S ^, 8 pressed, the slave order has been preserved by the exertions of Grett Britain.'- and bU ° yed and His Majesty’^&amp;oTOm'Srfo'hT' 11 ^™ 6 ^'- haS aIwa ys been the foreign encroachment, and it is on the effim'p 11 i 11 ' su P remac y against of alternative organisation too-ptbpr . ® c I en ^y °1 the service and the lack that the strongest a“;&amp; ifti^nt'Tthe^ ° f can be based.

It is quite certain that we could not willingly leave our shipping to be dependent upon the vagaries of a Persian system Letter 2758 from of lighthouses. The danger would be too great, and the Persian has of t '’ got to show greater capacity for organisation and maintenance before p. ksa. we could agree to such a proposal.” 27. The Government of India have indicated that in their view retention by His Majesty’s Government of responsibility for the lighting pm 9 . and buoying of the Gulf is indispensable. They add* : Present position is, of ccurse, open to attack by Persia from two points of view, firstly, India Office, c - 29th August 1928. many lights and buoys which we maintain lie in limits unquestionably Persian, like Bushire, Task, Bundar Abbas, Kishm, Henjam, Qais. Secondly, our service is financed by dues collected trom vessels (other than Government vessels and local sailing craft) entering not only Basrah but Abadan, which is Persian territory, though anchorage is technically Iraqian. It would, therefore, be not surprising if Persia discarded her passive attitude of acquiescence for active enae a your to oust us out of alX control in Persian waters. Yet, for the reasons discussed in Inter-departmental Conference in 1923, we must strenuously resist any interference with essentials of the status quo . We should, of course, make every effort to satisfy Persian susceptibilities, e.g. by conceding the flying of a Persian flag on the Qais lightship . . . Persian upkeep of at any rate unlit Bushire buoys, vide Risdent’s despatch of 21st July, Ho.275 S., and nominal Persian control of services in Persian waters elsewhere, n d bv admitting Persian representation (e.g.Consul) on our Domoa^ Advisory Commitfee, and perhaps (hut this is beyond our own sphere) on Basrlh Port Trust.
