Expanded trade records are recorded on large folded sheets that organise the trade records according to method of transport (steam versus sailing ship), ports of origin, commodity, quantity, and value in rupees. Most of the trade tables record imports but a few also record exports from Kuwait. The few letters that precede the records pertain to an exchange between the Ruler of Kuwait, Ahmed Al Jabir Al Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ], and the Political Agent in Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Administration of Customs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Customs administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000017#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000017#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000017#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
