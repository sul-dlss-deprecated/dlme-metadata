Many of the summaries are preceded by cover sheets and India Office notes sheets, the latter frequently containing handwritten notes giving a précis of the summary’s contents. The summaries cover a broad range of information, including: the activities of the Shah of Iran, Reza Shah Pahlavi, the Crown Prince, and other members of the royal family; activities of the Iranian Government and its officials; activities, organisation and strength of the Iranian army and Iranian air force; communications and transport, including wireless radio, and civil aviation routes into and out of Iran; British interests in Iran, including oil companies, specifically the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company; foreign interests in Iran; the Iranian press, focussing specifically on its criticism of foreign press and actions; commercial activities in Iran, including mining and factory production; tribal matters, including those in the Bahmai and Baluchistan provinces, and the Qashqai; place name changes in Iran. Proceedings prior to and during the Second World War are also covered in the summaries. These include: German activity in Iran (commercial, political, propaganda, Nazi organisation); movements of peoples; public opinion in Iran in response to events in Europe in 1940; the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August 1941; the abdication of Reza Shah Pahlavi; public opinion in Iran in the wake of the Anglo-Soviet invasion and occupation; social unrest and anti-British feeling.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shah of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Military Attaché, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran (1941)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00003e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
