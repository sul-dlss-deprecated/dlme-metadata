CONFIDENTIAL. i ?&gt; S 7 0 i May 29, 1935. Section 1. [E 2814/403/25] Sir John Simon to Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). (No. 153.) Sir, Foreign Office, May 29, 1935. I HAVE had under consideration your despatches Nos. 3, 26 and 40 of the 6th January, the 29th January and the 12th February respectively, regarding the recent Saudi Regulations on the subject of the ownership by foreigners of real property in Hejaz. 2. The explanatory communique issued by the Saudi Government (a translation of which was enclosed in your despatch No. 26 of the 29th January), and the record of your conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza (as reported in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the memorandum enclosed in your despatch No. 40 of the 12th February), suggest that there is now less danger of a rigorous and inequitable application of these regulations. Should, however, the Saudi authorities proceed against British subjects or protected persons who have been suffered in the past to acquire ownership of land in the Hejaz despite their foreign nationality (class (1) in paragraph 6 of your above-mentioned memo randum), I fear that it will not be possible to do more than to urge in their favour the general tolerance which, in default of direct evidence or of written permission, must presumably have existed to make the acquisition possible, and in the last resort to press for a reasonable opportunity for them to sell their land under equitable conditions. The regulations themselves do not expressly refer to the case of persons who have been suffered in the past to acquire ownership of land in the Hejaz, but as pointed out in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 446 of the 11th December, 1934, it would presumably be open to the Saudi Govern ment to maintain that such ownership was contrary to the law as reaffirmed in article 4 of the regulations. At the same time their contention would surely be weakened by the fact that “ previous Governments” in the form of the Ottoman and Hashimite regimes did in fact tolerate the acquisition of land by Indian and other Moslem “ foreigners.” I am unfortunately not in possession of any information which would answer the enquiry at (b) in paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 3 as to the attitude adopted under the Hashimite regime towards the ownership of land by foreign Moslems, but it appears at least to have been tolerated since cases have survived into the present regime. 3. As regards the case of British subjects or protected persons in class (II) in paragraph 6 of your memorandum, viz., those owning land in the Hejaz, who at the time of acquisition were Ottoman subjects, but who have subsequently become aliens vis-d-vis the Saudi State {e.g., Palestinians and Cypriots), it would not be possible to invoke the Treaty of Lausanne since the Hejaz did not become a party to it and the Saudi Government are clearly under no obligation to observe its provisions. The most that could be done on behalf of this class of person would be to insist on their obtaining a fair and reasonable opportunity to dispose of their land, such as the regulations themselves appear to allow. It now seems possible, however, from paragraph 3 of the translation of the Saudi communique enclosed in your despatch No. 26 that these persons will be allowed to retain their properties indefinitely, subject to the tax imposed by article 11 of the regulations. 4. I assume from telegram No. 7 of the 16th February from the High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (repeated to you as telegram No. 4) that the position of the Hashimite properties has now been satisfactorily settled, and that there is no longer any danger of the regulations being applied in their case. I am, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON.

As this discussion was of a general nature, exploratory on my part and explanatory on the part of Fuad Bey, I do not think it necessary to record it in detail. The principal thing that emerged from it was that Fuad Bey, who had nothing to do with the promulgation of the regulations, is greatly embarrassed and lias been trying to make the best of a bad job. His conversations with the foreign repre sentatives, several of whom have shown interest in the subject, may encourage him to make a further effort to undo the mischief wrought by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and others in his absence. 2. Another fact of some importance which emerged from my conversation with Fuad Bey is that the Saudi Government have made the mess, into which they have got themselves by their ill-considered legislation, still messier by trying to import into it conceptions and one or two terms derived from the former Ottoman legislation on one particular kind of property, viz., Government or “ Miri ” land. This was, as you are aware, the subject of elaborate Turkish legislation (see Young’s Corps de Droit ottoman, Vol. VI, p. 45 ff.), which defined the quasi-proprietorial rights of private occupants of land, the funda mental ownership of which was vested in the State. It dealt, inter alia, with the nature of the titles, which occupants could acquire. I do not know whether that legislation was ever applied in the Hejaz, but there is certainly no machinery now in existence in this country which could give effect to its principles, even if the position as regards the legal character of all titles were not, as Fuad Bey confessed to me, hopelessly confused. 3. I have embodied a short general account of my conversation with Fuad Bey in paragraph 7 of the enclosed memorandum, which I have thought it advisable to circulate to the posts indicated in it, in view of the repercussions of this question in various directions. 4. As the enclosed memorandum brings the whole situation up to date, and as the special question of Hashimite properties is now the subject of separate telegraphic correspondence, I am not sending copies of this covering despatch to anv other British authority. THE Saudi regulations on real property, which were mentioned in para graph 241 of the Jedda report for October and have been referred to in later reports, have proved to be of wider interest than was anticipated. I am therefore circulating this general account of the matter for the benefit of the above posts, although some of them are already fully or partly aware of the facts. 2. The regulations in question were published in two instalments in the Umm-al-Qura of the 19th and 26th October last. They reasserted the principle that no foreigner may acquire real property in the Hejaz, subject to a relaxation already admitted by regulations promulgated in 1931 and reincorporated with EASTERN (Arabia). March 4, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 7. [E 1461/403/25] No. 1. Sir A . Ryan to Sir John Simon. — (Received March 4.) (No. 40.) Sir, Jedda, February 12, 1935. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum by Sir Andrew Ryan on Foreign Ownership of Real Property m the Hejaz. [356 d—7]'2 4 ' slight alterations of form only in the regulations now in question. This relaxation was that a foreign Moslem could acquire property for the sole purpose of converting it simultaneously into a Wakf, hut only a Wakf, for the perpetual benefit of Moslems in the Hejaz. 3. What was really new in the regulations was the provision rcgai ding persons who had acquired their property as Ottoman subjects but who had become aliens vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia. Such persons were required to sell their property^ to a Saudi subject or to convert it into Wakf, as above, within one year and were deprived, by an obscurely worded article, of the right of disposal in the meantime. It was provided that the period might be prolonged on application to the Government, subject to the payment of a tax of 15 per cent, per annum of the income from the property during any extended period allowed. Foreigners inheriting property were similarly required to sell it to a Saudi or convert into Wakf. 4. The basic principle that foreigners may not acquire real property in the Hejaz was incorporated in an Ottoman Law of 1867, the famous “ Law of Sefer,' which conferred on foreigners the right to hold real property in the Ottoman Empire, except in the Hejaz, subject to their Governments adhering to an instru ment known as the Protocol of Sefer. The principle has more than once in the recent past been reasserted by the Saudi authorities. In itself it cannot be contested on any ground of international law or special treaty enabling British subjects to acquire real property in the Hejaz. Nevertheless two classes of question arise, as follows :— (a) In practice many British subjects and protected persons were in the past allowed to acquire property qua Moslems. Can they now be deprived of rights which they acquired by tolerance under previous regimes ? (5) Many persons who were Ottoman subjects and had therefore a clear legal right to acquire property are now subjects of States other than Saudi Arabia which have emerged from the ruin of the Ottoman Empire. Can they now be compelled to part with their property? And, if not protected in any other way, are they protected by article 33 of the Treaty of Lausanne? 5. Arising out of earlier correspondence regarding the regulations, I drew the further attention of His Majesty’s Government to the questions at (a) and (b) above in a despatch No. 3 of the 6th January. Shortly after I had done so, the Saudi Government issued a communique dated the 18th January, which was by way of remedying the grievances created by the regulations of last October, which it purported not to amend but to interpret. The main points in this communique were as follows :— (a) The regulations rested on a basis of Islamic principle applicable only to the Hejaz, not to other parts of Saudi Arabia. ip) The Government were considering possible legislation to enable foreigners to hold Government (“ Miri ”) property “by way of long lease and other proper Sharia means.” (c) The Government did not wish to take retroactive measures against persons, now aliens, who, as Ottoman subjects, had acquired property under the Turkish regime or persons who had acquired it under the Hashimite regime. U had therefore given them the right of applyin 0, for an extension of the period of one year. 6. This communique has not placated the interested foreign missions, least of all perhaps the Iraqi Legation, which apart from its general interest, is specially interested in the case of the properties owned by members of the Hashimite family. Certain xestiictions on the exercise of their rights by members of that family were removed in 1933 and it is now suggested that the regulations of last October may undo the effect of that removal of restrictions. 7. I discussed the whole subject unofficially with Fuad Bev Hamza on the 6th February. He admitted that the article in the regulations which deprives owners of the right of disposal of their properties pending sale or conversion into Wakf was badly worded and said that it did not mean that they could not let their property. He said that the provision of the communiqud mentioned at {c) in paragraph 5 above was intended to be promissory, i.e., that if applications were made for an extension of time they would be granted, and granted for an■SHI si 3 indefinite period. He admitted that the special 15 per cent, tax remained in force. He was vague on various minor points I raised, including the unfortunate political effect of the action of the Government in so far as it might affect the interests of the Hashimites. Incidentally he admitted that the state of tenures in the Hejaz was hopelessly confused and that, though the law’ refers to Govern ment or “Miri ' property, which was the subject of important Turkish legisla- tion, it would be very hard to say what the tenure of any property was. 8. Fuad Bey made no secret of the fact that he disapproved of the regula tions, which were promulgated in his absence. He told me that he had had them by him for a long time, but had always been unwilling to see them promulgated both for economic and political reasons. He has had to face so much criticism by the foreign representatives, although I do not think that any mission has taken the matter up officially as yet, that he may make a further effort to remedy the mischief. In any case, I am inclined to think that Ibn Saud would find some means of meeting the special grievance of the Hashimites, but at present those of the family who are not Saudi subjects are in the same position as other ex-Ottoman owners of property.

Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. c^.F.N Previous papers :— The Amir Abdullah has raised w T ith the British Resident in Transjordan the question of the effect of the new Saudi regulations, making it illegal for foreigners to own real property in the Hejaz, on the Hashimite properties which were restored to the Hashimites as a result of negotiations between Ibn Saud and King Feisal in 1933. It would obviously be unfortunate if the latter arrangement were to be set aside so soon after its conclusion but Sir A. Ryan is inclined to think that Ibn Saud will find means to treat the case of the Hsshimites as one apart. The Saudi regulations, which are flagged at 'A H , have been somewhat mitigated by the issue last January of the official communique at flag »B H , stating (para. 3 / 2730 1000 4.34. (para. 3) that the Saudi Government do not desire to make the regulations retroactive in the case of Ottoman andHashimite proprietors who have since become 'foreigners' in the Hejaz. On the other hand in default of a special arrangement the Hashimites would still under the terms of the communique have to make an application under Article XI of the regulations for the postponement of their operation and submit to a tax of 15% on income. Such an application would also apparently be tantamount to an admission in principle of the illegality of their ownership of property. The Foreign Office are naturally anxious to continue to avoid becoming entangled in this question, but Sir A. Ryan sees no objection to his making informal representations to the Saudis (which would not commit H.M.G. to future responsibility) and he has already in fact taken action in this sense on the basis of instructions previously issued to him in 1933 (P.Z. According to the Amir Abdullah, King Ghazi is likely to approach H.M.G. on the question and Sir F. Humphrys has been warned, if H.M. broaches the matter, to avoid any committment (P.Z.1080/35). Negotiations with the Saudis have hitherto been conducted on behalf of the Hashimites by the Iraqi representative in Saudi-Arabia. ^ urVdSfi^ ^ *Us ^ /2^ F&lt;&amp;-. * r-l.nos 7a~ -T F. w » y — ^ F.

Sir* With reference to ay despatch Wo.3 of 6th Janiary, relative to the recent Saudi legislation on real property in the He jess* I have the honour to forward herewith a \ x - translation of a coau&amp;uniqud of XSth January* which the Saudi here on the same date and which was published in the 'tjaia—al- ura on 24th January. It purports to interpret the regulations promulgated last October and is obviously intended to hi ve a reassuring effect. I believe it to be the work of Puda Bey Hamaa* who was away when the regulations were issued and on his return realised that they were too drastic. Fuad Bey told ae himself on 21st January that the com iuniqud was one of the fruits of his labours at Riyadh and claimed that it removed every objection to the regulations. I hope to discuss the matter more fully with him ^hen he next comes to Jedda* but in the meantime I think the position is that ha has had to compromise with the authors of the regulations. The result is not very satisfactory for the reasons stated in the following paragraphs. 2* sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of the eommmlQud t eal with the acquisition of property by ioreigncrs. The forms? reaffirms the principle that, so far as the Hejaz and the Hej&amp;z only is concerned, foreigners are precluded irom Government circulated of it daily to the foreign missions acquiring/ The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.S.I#, K.C.V.O.,acquiring property# The following sub-paragraph loreshadows some measure of relief for foreignerat who are Moslems, but it contemplates only measures to enable such foreigners to possess Government owned property e.g#t under long leases# Both sub—paragraphs represent the attitude of the Government as being in conformity with Shari*a law but* so far as 1 am aware* that law as such does not preclude any Moslem fro® acquiring property in the Helas in full ownership# In any case* the com^uniqad does not meet the difficulty of foreigners, who* being \ 1 \ ■ Moslems* were allowed in the past to acquire property, despite the provisions of the Ottoman law of 1867. 3. Sub-paregraph 3 of the communique deals with properties owned by persons who* at the time of acquisition, were Ottoman or Hashlmite subjects and were therefore entitled to own property* not only under the Shari*a but under the former civil law* It holds out to ths owners a hop© of favourable consideration of applications under Article 11 of the recent regulations and this is probably intended as a definite promise. It Is not* however* so worded. Moreover it does not set aside the rule in Article 8, which appears to limit the right of the foreign owner to the iUll enjoyment of his property pending sale to a Saudi subject or conversion into ’ratef or the rule in Article 11 Itself that a special tax of 16 of the income from the property must be paid 4. I hope to be able to report further on the subject when I hove been able to discuss it more fully with Fuad during any period of grace allowed Bey/- 2C&gt; Bey Hamsa* In the meantime I would advert to two papers which have reached me since I wrote my despatch under reference* 5. The foreign Secretary to the Oovernmetfc of India wrote me a despatch on 84th December, tfo*F 366-N/54, a copy of which has presumably been communicated to you by the India Office* This despatch crossed a copy of my despatch under reference, which to some extent answered it* I am endeavouring to fora an idea of the scale on which Indians own r«?al property, although I foresee great difficulty in obtaining exact ini ora tit ion. You are doubtless considering the suggestion of the Oovernaent of Indie that, if any representations arc to be made, they should be ^ade in eoncrrt by all the Governments wnoee nationals are affected* For myself, I may say that, while 1 try to keep In touch with ay colleagues In regard to such matters of common interest, I prefer separate action in the conditions prevailing here* 6* You have probably been furnished also with a copy a ^4 &lt;31 4 4 *1 &lt;4 jfe asrwt 4* *% Vi ^ *Pf ' Oft //A. f&gt; f* T* w *• «m %«v#*** «lhVJV^;rAV.*.«a JL J-J** w w** a TVr W * v 'y w W* -■ -w mrnm mm v p addressed by His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Colonial Office regarding the effect of the will be remembered that in the early summer of 1933, Ibn asud removed the restrictions previously Imposed on the enjoyment of their properties in this country by members of the Hashimite family, with one exception* For several years before that decision was taken, His Majesty’s Government were consistently unwilling to intervene officially/officially In the metier tout, haring regard to the InstructIona given to ae at the time, I am assuming that there con toe no object ion to my sounding Fuad Bey personally and cautiously on the question shether the regulations of last October and the enclosed comauniqud apply to Hashimite properties* I am Inclined to think that Iton Baud will find means to treat their case as one apart* 7* X am sending copies of this despatch, and &lt;mcloaure to Hia Excellency the Viceroy of India (Foreign and Political Department) 9 His Excellency the Governor of * * the Straits Settlements, Singapore, and to His Majesty^ High Commissioner for Transjordan,, Jerusalem.

In view of the representations of His Highness the Amir, I am anxious to learn whether it is actually the intention of the Government of Saudi Arabia to apply this law to the Hashimite properties, and I shall be glad therefore if, should no objection be seen. His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah may be invited to ascertain the facts. Should the Government of Saudi Arabia indeed contemplate the application of the law to the Hashimite properties, I trust that ail possible steps will be taken by His Majesty f s Government to dissuade then from this purpose.

OFFICrJoF THE BRITISH RESIDENT, TRANS-JORDAN, Af'MAN,7th December, 193U* Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform you that some few days ago His Highness the Amir spoke'to me with considerable indignation of a law which had recently been promulgated by the Saudi Government which makes it illegal for other than Saudi subjects to own immovable property in the Hejaz and makes it obligatory for foreigners to sell any such property of which they might be possessed to Saudi subjects. 2. His Highness spoke of addressing King Ibn Saud direct on the injustice of this law and the disregard which it shows to an agreement which has been concluaed between King Ali and King Ibn Saud. I managed to dissuade His Highness from writing and suggested that it might be best for me to forward a statement of the case to Your Excellency so that if possible the matter might be taken up by His Majesty’s Minister in Jeddah.. 3. The enclosed memorandum was prepared,at my suggestion, by the Chief Minister’s Secretary on information given him by His Highness and clearly explains the case.

P.COX, BRITISH RESIDENT.3 ^ MEMORANDA ON TNE CASS OP THE IMMOVABLE PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE HASHIMITE FAMILY IN HEJAZ. (Prepared by the order of His Higness the Amir). • At the time of the downfall of the Hashimite regime in Hejaz in 1926 and the occupation of Mecca by King Ibn Saud, an Agreement between King Ali and Ibn Saud was concluded, whereby the latter agreed to recognise and protect the rights of all the members of the Hashimite Family in all immovable property which then belonged to them. The Agreement went even further in providing also for the recognition and protection of the rights of the Hashimite f s servants and dependants in any immovable property belonging to taem. By the terms of that Agreement,King Ibn Saud undertook to leave all such property as the Hashimites were in possession of, uninterfered with* 2. After the Agreement had been signed by the two Kings, Ex-King Ali,before leaving Jeddah delivered the same to the British Consul there and requested him to retain it at the Consulate* 3. Notwithstanding the existence of the Agreement reierred to above, King Ibn Saud later on,seized the property of the Hashimites and a number of their houses were occupied by his relatives and favourites,some of whom continue to live in them till now. 4« The revenues of the property were taken by King Ibn Saud and for the part occupied by his relatives no rent was ever paid to the owners. 5. After the negotiations commenced between King Ibn Saud uid the late King Faisal for the establishment of friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and iraq, and the conclusion35 31 conclusion thereafter, of a Bon Voisinage Agreement between the two countries, King Ibn Saud released his hold over the Hashimite ’ s property. As a result of that action,a sum of about £P. 680 was sent last year to Ex-King All at Baghdad through the Iraqi Foreign Office. This sum of money was said to represent the shares of Ex-King Ali, the late King Faisal and His Highness the Amir Abdullah from the revenues of their property for a period of two years, viz: 1350 and 1351 (A.H. ). The revenue for the past years was not accounted for nor paid* 6. Although the question of the property revenue is a matter which should not be neglected the main object of this memorandum is another more important question, here- after stated:- The Saudi Government have i*ecently enacted a law called (Nizam for the Acquisition of Immovable property in Hejaz). This Nizam, a copy of which is attached to this memorandum, has been published in No.514 dated the 19th October,1934, of ’Um El Qura’, the Official Gazette of the Saudi Government* 8 Attention is particularly drawn to Articles 6,^, %%. 8,104-2 and 13 of the Nizam. 9 ^ The promulgation of the said Nizam gives ri^e to the following questions:- (a) In view of the Agreement referred in paragraph 1 of this memorandum,will the terms of the Nizam apply to the immovable property in Hejaz belonging to the Hashimites ? And, if so, to what extent? (b) in the event of the Nizam not being applicable to the Hashimite’s property,what guarantee does the Saudi Government give for such exception? 10 .10, As they stand,the provision of the Nizam (if x* applicable to the Hashimite’s property) would mean a violation of the terms of the above mentioned Agrement*. What proper line of action should be taken in this respect, is the matter on which the friendly advice of the British Resident is now being sought.Prom f Umm el Qura’ No.514 dated 19.10.34 RPGUTjATION re possession op immovable property in hejaz.

TTbOO/861/20) British Lega Jedda. 30th June f I ^KZ- 4585 1933 Sir, With reference to my despatch No.188 of June 20, relative to Hashimite properties in the Hejaz, I have the honour to state that hasir Bey Al-Gaylani called on me on June 29, and left with me copies of two papers viz, (a) a rescript from the King to the Amir Naysal, as President of the Council of Ministers and (b) a letter from the Amir, as Minister of the Interior, to the agent of one branch of the Hashimite family. I enclose translations of these papers. Nasir Bey regarded them as eminently satisfactory and, on the face of them they appear to restore very completely the rights of all the Ashraf with one exception. This is the Sherif Hhalid Ibn Sadiq, who would appear to be the Sherif Khalid implicated last year in the Ad-Dabbagh conspiracy. 2 . I consider that the only course now to adopt is to let the interested parties judge by experience whether the decision of the Sa^di Government is as favourable as it appears to be on the surface. I have no reason to doubt this, as I believe Ibn Sa f tid to have been genuinely desirous of making a beau geste but there is just a possibility that subordinates may show themselves less well-disposed. In any case very definite progress / has The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.,K.C.V.O., etc., etc. , etc.has been made and I give great credit to the T Iraqi representative for his handling of the business. 3. Nasir Bey seemed doubtful about the position as regards the Amir Zeyd, King Hussein's youngest son, who, as you Know, has certain interests independent of those of the rest of the family, derived from his Turkish mother. He agreed with my view that he could well afford to await developments in this connexion. In any case, this is a matter of even less concern to His Majesty's Government than the claims of the elder brothers. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and His Majesty's High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem.

I have also carried out my ^ intention of keeping in touch with the T Iraqi representative here. I now enclose a translation of a note addressed to the latter by the Sa T udi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a copy of which Nasir Bey was good enough to communicate to me on June 17 . You will see by it that the 3a T udi Government have expressed readiness to relax, although apparentiy/apparently without removing, their control of the properties and have tendered a payment in respect of monies due to three of the co-proprietors, viz.. King Ali, the Amir T Abdullah and Mng Feisal. 3 . The T Iraqi representative is satisfied with the progress he has made* ne is now, I understand, taking steps to have the powers of attorney held hy his secretary legalised by the Sa T udi authorities. He states that one of these powers was given by the Amir T Abdullah but I gather that certain other members of the family, e.g., Sheri T Ali Pasha, the former Grand Sherif now living in Egypt, have taken their own action independently of that of the sons of King Hussein. 4 - I do not propose to take any further action with the oa T udi Government at present. It may still be hoped that, so far as the Amir T Abdullan is concerned, tne situation will be consolidated when the present treaty negotiations have been concluded and when the T Amir and Ibn 3a T ud have met, if the meeting takes place, I have throughout avoided anything calculated to involve His i.ajesty T s Government officially in the matter, naking it plain to the T Iraqi representative that they are unwilling to be so involved and confining myself with Fuad Bey to an intimation that we snould all welcome a settlement. 5* I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem.

No opportunity occurred for the discussion of official business on the road since the Saudi gent in Damascus was also of the party. In the evening Teufik Bey suggested that it would be wise for the King to restore the full control of their property to the Hashimites. Sheikh Yusef informed him that certain payments had already been made and that it wa* the King^ policy to pay the Revenue of their estates to the Hashimites but to retain the control of the properties in Saudi hands until such time as the control of the Haramein Wakfe in Iraq were placed under Saudi control. Teufik Bey said that the two cases could not be compared and that he would like to speak to the King him self on this matter and the matter of the Amir’s reception should he make pilgrimage. Sheikh Yusef attempted to dissuade Teufik Bey but finding him determined to speak of these matters at the Interview with the King, which had been arranged, Sheikh Yusef went to see the King and on his return said that the King His Excellency, The Acting High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, Jerusalem.wmmmmmmmm King had told him that the matter was not of great importance and could easily be settled ?/hen he and Abdullah met. Teufifc Bey believing that Sheikh Yusef habitually wishes to keep people from discussing business direct with the King so that his value as an intermediary may not be diminished continued to insist and next morning after Sheikh Yusef had again come back from seeing the King was conducted to his interview rather later than had been originally arranged. Ibn Saoud enquired after the Amir^ health and after saying that the Amir was the member of Hussein’s familyg) whom he had known and liked the best, he added that he had not started the quarrel and had never been the aggressor therein but had been forced to such measures as he had taken to defend himself. Teufik Bey said the Amir was open hearted by character and that the future seemed much brighter. He thanked the King for the assurance he had given to the Iraqi Consul and said that the matter of Hashimite property, though less important than many others, could, if satisfactorily settled, remove a small cloud from the face of the sun. The King said Teufik must not thank him as He and the Sherifs were old friends and what he had done was only what oould be expected of him and that if any of the family were without property it would be his duty to give them some of his own. Teufik Bey then said that the matter could perhaps best be terminated should the King and the Amir meetmeet at some not far distant date and suggested that the meeting might perhaps be on the oooasion of the Amir making pilgrimage. Ibn Saoud agreed that this was so # and added that he would be happy should the Amir decide to make the pilgrimage. The situation thus appears to be quite satis factory and I am in agreement with Sir Andrew Ryan, to whom full details of his interview were given by Teufik Bey, that he oould not at present usefully do more than to express his pleasure, in conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza, that the situation was so satisfactory.

It is not so muoh vis~ei~vis of Saudi Government, hut of Hashimites that it seems desireihle not to commit His Majesty T s Govemment to intervention. Question concerns private property of Hashimite family. His I'iajesty’s Government have no direct responsibility in matter at all, and, save in respect of Amir Abdullah, they have no clear locus standi for intervention. On other hand, difficulties concerning property may often arise again and cause friction with Ibn Baud; but once committed, it will be difficult vis-a-vis of Hr.shinh.tes to refuse intervention in future. It may not always be possible to influence Hashimites attitude in matter and additional complication of disagreement within family might arise. Unless you see special reasons to contrary, it still seems best therefore that any action on your part shoula be of nature which makes it clear to Hashimites that His Majesty l s Government do not consider themselves directly involved in matter.

Subject to any further views which Sir A.Ryan may wish to express we are disposed at present to take the view that the best method of approach would be that at forthcoming treaty negotiations (but not as part of such negotiations) the delegate from Trans Jordan should cooperate with the Iraqi charge d’affaires in direct discussion with Saudi G vernment. Thoy could if they wished seek Sir A.Ryan’s advice and if they experience difnculties they might invite his mediation with Saudi Government. This would as far as possible be given m his personal capacity since Foreign Office are still inclined to avoid direct intervention of His Majesty’s Government. Before deciding I shall be Glad to receive your views. If you agree generally, I suggest that you consult Amir Abdulla, who, if he concurs, might com amicate with King Faisal with a view to arranging for cooperation of their representatives on lines indicated above. It seems desirable however xfcat the matter should only bo broached with Saudi ^ov.,i.ni.ie.at ii treaty negotiations are proceeding well, if they are not, it would probably be better that a further controversial subject should not be introduced at initial stage.

Acting Iraq representative has spoken to me about question of Kashimite property which he has been pursuing with Saudi Government with indeterminate result. I gather Iraq Government consider property with tne exception of some settled by King Hussein on Amir Zeid, as being joint property of descendants of Aun. In any case Amir Abdullah is co-interested with other parties including King Ali and Faisal. They all seem (gr. unaec.) give general power of attorney to a secretary in Iraq Legation here. I considered formerly that His Majesty's Govern ment could not usefully intervene so long as relations between Ibn Saud and Hashimites were strained and that when treaties between Iraq and this country were concluded it was mainly question for Iraq to deal with. Situation has now changed to the extent that there is prospect of better relations between Ibn Saud and Abdullah. As you are aware latter has himself expressed hopes that means may be found to settle question of property. See record of my conversation with him on February 16th.2 . My present view is that in present more favourable circumstances we ought to do something for Abdullah and that the best course would be to broach question in the course of forthcoming negotiations in agreement with Faisal. Joint or parallel British and Iraqi action might at least put it in the way of settlement, especially as Ion baud is showing generally conciliatory tendencies just now. I have suggested to Iraq representative that he might do well to go slowly for the present. I drafted this telegram hurriedly to catch the post and have not had time to read the whole previous correspondence.

Religious principle underlying above exception distin guished only between Moslems and non-Moslems so that under religious law former even if foreign could acquire property. Application of religious principle produced cases of ownership by foreign Moslems many of which survive. Modem tendency i© to enforce prohibition against all foreigners as such subject to exception in case of property intended to be made Waqf in accordance with law forwarded in despatch of October 4 last to Department of Education Health and Lands and to permission to acquire property for ordinary purposes which is still given to certain resident foreign Moslems of long standing.

Bombay Castle^ 2nd February 1931, from the Secretary to the (government of Bombay, Political Department, to the foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department. Subject;- Claim to the property of Ahdul TahaB who died I am directed By the Governor in Council to forward, for such action as the Government of India may deem necessary, applications dated the 7th and 19th January 1931 respectively from ABdul l^lajid Musa Asia Hafasji and Haji Abdul Baheman Ahmed Asia Eafasji of Godhra, regarding their claims to a share in the property of their late uncle Ahdul ahah who died at Mecca. at MeccaOo&amp;hra, Dated 7.1.19&amp;L To The Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay f Bombay Applicants- Abdul Majid Musa Asia Hafasji, residing at Godhra, in Guhya street Godhra (Panch Mahals). Claim to property of deceased Abdul ¥ahab who died at Mecca in Arabia as domiciled subject of Arabian Government. Sir That the above named Abdul Wahab is my uncle and he went from here to Mecca and domicled there to carry on his trade. That he died last year leaving some property of a large amount in value which was inheritable by his six nephews according to the Sariyat of Islam religion as he had no issue of his own surviving after him. His wife claimed some share in the said legacy. Thus there were seven claimants who were amenable for the inheritance. 2. That last year out of the abovesaid six nephews some three went there in }ecca personally to claim and receive their shares of the inheritance and I claimed my part of the legacy left by my uncle deceased Abdul ISahab by an application addressed to the Governor of Mecca dated 10th December 1929 which was duly accompanied by a certificate of my relationship with the deceased and stating my claim of the share according to the Shariyat of Islam. That the said application was duly acknow ledged by the Government of Mecca and that I received a letter written in Urdu signed by the Khadim of Mecca in which it was written that the property was being assessed and collected and that the share apportionable to me will he duly given to me on the said apportionment of all the shares. 3. That the abovesaid three nephews and the wife of the deceased Abdul ¥ahab have returned from Mecca with their apportionableapportionaole shares out of the legacy left by AMul Wahab and they aid that there are some arrears yet to be recovered on account of the legacy still to be distributed among the ^ claimants and that the share of mine apportionable to me according to my claim has been said to have been deposited in the G-overnment Bank of Mecca for remittance to me. That the said share of mine was not delivered to them as per my application and it was kejt there in the Bank as aoove said, 4. Since the first correspondence regarding this claim of mine i.e., application dated 1012*29 I have passed other reminders which are dated 26.2.1930, 27.6.1930 and 8.12.1930 respectively. That the first two despatches have been duly acknowledged by the Arabian Government and I hold the postal acknowledgments of them all. But the latest one i.e., the one dated 8.12.30 was sent duly registered, is returned as r ef used and hence I am at loss how to proceed further as to receiving and realising my claim of my share of the legacy now rtdlth the Grovernment of Arabia. 5. That the other five claimants who are the nephews likewise did get their shares of the legacy while I am the one who is under the disability to get his claim realized so far by the refusal of the packet containing my reminder and I c have to approach you to have necessary instructions and g idancj and consequent orders on the subject. 6. That if necessary I will submit the packet of my last corresponde: ce addressed to Arabian Governor Mecca, which is returned as refused and is in my hand, on receipt of your similar orders. That if there is any Consul of the Arabian Government at Bombay and if your Honour should refer this to him, I would wait your Honour’s further instructions. 7. That I am a British subject living at Godhra bom at Godhra and so I am entitled to your Honour’s favour and conse quent consideration of my above request for further guidance and further instructions and orders on the subject.

Arrears outstanding due for distribution and payment out of the legacy left oy late Abdul Ifauab of Kecca who died at 1 ecca in 1930. Sir, I have to humbly submit that -&gt;ome of the assets recovered on the legacy left by late Abdul Wahab of Mecca were duly handed over to the legal heirs who appeared at I ecca claiming their legitimate shares of the legacy left by late Abdul lahab. The apportionment was made by the Government of yecca and there were some arrears amounting to the sum of Rs.1900-0-0, which were still to be collected from the debtors who held them for payment to the Government of Mecca and distributed to the legal heirs of the deceased Abdul W&amp;hab, have not yet been received by the legal heirs who received their previous allotments at Mecca and therefore I have to approach your Honour and request that a prompt inquiry be made from the Government of fecca or the Betul—Mahal as it is called ii- Arabia where the custody of the assets and apportionment of shares due on the legacy, of aid Abdul Tahab is carried out and rests on behalf of Arabian Government and they may be asked to make the remittance early to us. 2. That there are seven heirs who are legally entitled to receive their shares of the legacy left by Abdul Wahab and I am the one- a nephew of Abdul Wahab entitled to receive shares of myself as also of Bai iariyam widow of the deceased. Thus the arrears due to be received by me relate the shares of two heirs i.e. , one share of the applicant and one share of Bai Mari yam widow of the deceased who died at GodhraGrO&amp;taxa some days 'back after receiving tier first allotment given her in distribution at Mecca. That the said Mariyam’s guardian and trusteeship vested in me by order of the Arabian G-overnment and the said order is now with me. 3 # Under circumstances I humbly pray that needful may he done by your Honour in this case and I may be obliged by your reply early in the matter with the remittance due for me.

July 21 , 1930. Sir, With reference to your despatch Jo.4939 of Jay 14, I have the honour to state that I again took up the question of the acquisition of property in this country hy Iraq nationals with the Acting ^ inister for Foreign Affairs on July 13. Fuad Bey stated quite positively that this question had in fact been discussed with the Iraq Ministers when he was in Baghdad in aroh* I understood him to say that he had explained the position on the day on which the ion Voisinage agreement was initialled. 2. Lest, lowever, there should be any misunder standing, I obtained a clear statement from Fuad Bey. He informed me quite definitely that the law of the * Hejaz proper, founded on ancient tradition, precluded any foreigner, irrespective of his religion, from acquiring real property in that country; but that in Nejd or in any other part of Ibn Baud 1 s dominions there was no similar restriction. 3 . I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Office. I find that &gt;ir Gilbert Clayton sent to the Colonial Office a copy of his original despatch to Jr.Bond £ 30.9029 of August 28. The intervening papers do not seem to have been sent home from this post, but they dealt only with the efforts made to obtain the information then asked for. As my present despatch e?fiboaies. •... The Acting High Commissioner for Iraq.embodies a pronouncement on the important question of principle raised, I consider it important that it should be in the possession of His Majesty's Government.

The early correspondence in the file (1930-1931) relates to the estates of deceased British Indian citizens (and one Chinese national). The remainder of the file's correspondence is chiefly concerned with the status of private properties in the Hejaz belonging to the Hashimite family. Much of this correspondence documents the progress of negotiations for the aforementioned properties to be restored to the Hashimite family; further correspondence speculates on the possible impact on Hashimite properties of Saudi regulations introduced in October 1934 (a translated copy of which is included in the file, at folios 39-44) which, it is reported, state that foreigners may not own immovable property in the country.The file features the following principal correspondents: His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan); the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Sir John Simon); the High Commissioner for Transjordan (Arthur Grenfell Wauchope); the British Resident, Transjordan (Charles Henry Fortnom Cox); His Majesty's Ambassador in Baghdad (Sir Francis Henry Humphrys); His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires to Jedda (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill); the British Consul General, Kashgar (Frederick Williamson); the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India; Nuri Al Sa'id [Nūrī al-Sa‘īd], former Iraqi Prime Minister; officials of the Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department, and the Government of Bombay's Political Department.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Resident</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Nūrī al-Sa'īd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>House of Hashim (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreigners</topic></subject><subject><topic>Property</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00027f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
