G. Alban, 0. B. E. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Manama t Bahrein Dear Major Alban: In reply to your letter #2082-17/21 relative to a set of wheels and tires to fit a 1939 Pord pickup: It is our impression that if the pickup which Mr. Khalil Kanoo is offering you is a standard 1939 model Ford, the wheels which we can give you will fit the hubs without extra fittings or machine work. We are sending you one wheel and tire complete so that you may fit it to the pickup and make certain that these wheels will fit before sending the other four to you. You will find that the fenders will have to be trimmed to make room for the larger tires. We have found it advisable also to add one additional leaf to each spring so as to raise the body higher to make room for the larger wheels and tires. I believe that you will find that this is the only work necessary. If it be true that a fitting is required to expand the hubs, I suggest that the fittings be made at Bapco if they are to do the other work for you. We make these fittings as required in our own shop, and since we do not carry extras, it would be advantageous to have them made while other wcrk is being done on the car. If you find that the wheel which is being sent to you will serve your purpose, which I hope it will, we will forward four more wheels and tires with two spare tubes. Please advise if we can be of any further assis tance on this subject. Yours very truly,No.2135-17/21• Political Agency, Bahrain. Dated the 27th October 1941.

The arrangement at present is, that I remain in Bahrain until the end of October and then return to Sharjah* 3* The Political Agent suggests that we sell the pick-up while there is still a chance of getting a reasonably good price for it and make do with the truck until new pick-ups come into the market* He thinks that if we wait too long the market value of the pick-up will become negligible. Please let me have your views and ascertain how much the , pick-up would fetch if sold now. The chances of obtaining a new pick-up are uncertain but some new Chevrolet pick-ups may be arriving within the next six months* 4* v I hope all goes well on the Trucial Coast and that you and your family are enjoying good health. Please give my salaams to the Sheikhs when you see them* Yours sincerely, Jassim bin Mohammed, Residency Agent, Sharjah.D.O.lTo.963. British Agency, Sharjah, Dated,20th September 1945 Thanh you for your P.O.No.3708 dated 12th September 1945. T v/as delighted to heat that you have returned to Bahrain. T hope you had a pleasant time in Jerusalem and liked the place very much. As desired, T attach a note containing the information you ’--anted and hope that this is all you v/ant. If you require any other details, please let me know and T will gladly send you. All has been quiet here since you left except t T '0 usual incidents of Americans coming down to the village at night and behaving in an unseemly manner. One v/as reported in a previous Diary and the other happened night before last and will be reported in this fortnight’s Diary. Nobody v/as hurt and no material damage was done. T reported both incidents as they occurred to the ^.A.F.for investigation and necessary action, ^here have been no incidents by the B.A.F.or the BOAC, personnel. Bahrain could not help us over the question of a relief for Ahmad. Finding that he v/as not keeping good health and v/as in great need of a change, I allowed him to go on 50 days r leave and T am now doing his work in addition to mine. His leave expires on the 5th October, ynd T should be very grateful if you would kindly instruct him, if he is still in Bahrain, to return to duty as soon as his leave expires. On the 17th I held a dinner banquet for the Shaikhs and notables at the Agency in celebration of TT.J.Day which v/ent off very well. It v/as like the one we held on the Y.E.Day but on a slightly smaller scale as Bahrain had limited the expenditure to Bs.1,000/- only. 14 Europeans from the Camp were also invited. The Shaikh of Sharjah could not attend as he was sick at Ras al Khaimah. The Shaikh of Has al Khaimah also did not attend as he v/as away in the desert and so did the Regent of Kalba who was away at Kalba. All the other Shaikhs and notables attended. Shaikh Said of Dubai will be leaving -'or Huscat by launch within the next three days on a private visit to the Sultan. The state of affairs at Kalb^ and Khaur Fakkan are as bad as before in spite of the Regent s presence there. I should like to go there on the return of Ahmad, if you see no objection. Regarding the pick-up. As you know it is our sole efficient means of transport and, if we sell it now, we will be completely demobilized. We cannot rely on the truck for several reasons. Firstly, apart from the fact that travelling by it is quite uncomfortable, it cannot negotiate sandy roads- for instance, we cannot travel by it to Ras al Khaimah, Dhaid’ or Abu Dhabi. It is only good for trips from Sharjah to Dubai and the camp, if exigencies of work necessitate touring to Ras al Khaimah, Abu Dhabi or Kalba, we cannot perform, it if we haven’t got the pick-up. We cannot borrow or hire any car from the Shaikh of Sharjah as his cars are not in a good condition (he had recently asked me to lend him one of our cars for his brother to go to Buraimi which I politely refused). Dubai is in exactly the same position as Sharjah. Chances of obtaining reliable transport from the R.A.F. are uncertain. Ifl fact, when I v/anted to proceed to Abu Dhabi and asked the R.A.F.authorities Captain R.C.IAirphy, Political Officer,Trucial Coast, Camp, Bahrain.2 h /* to let me use one of the 'nti-Locust vehicles on this trip, they did not ayree as they demanded v/ritten permission from the Anti-Locust Officer which I did not possess, and after some reluctance, they agreed to let me have the yorris double gear vehicle but it was reduced to a deplorable state of unfitness. It had two punctures on the way, its fan belt broke, its petrol pipe had to be cleaned up after every 5 miles 1 drive. The return journey from Abu Dhabi took me 15 hours! But on the contrary,^ the pick-up did the journey without any incident. Secondly, it is necessary to have two transports always so that if one breaks down or is under repairs, the other one can be used. I do not, therefore, advise the sale of the pick-up how if the chances of obtaining a new pick-up are uncertain. If new pick-ups do come onto the Bahrain market, I do not think any of them will immediately find their way to the Trucial Coast, so I do not expect that prices here will fall considerably. If the pick-up is sold now, it will fetch Bs. 8000/-. We can, however, sell the pick-up if we are sure that we will be able to get a new one after a fortnight or so of our parting with it. I have recently had the pick-up properly overhauled, its body,- engine and underneath parts painted and its upholstery renewed. I have changed some worn-out parts of the engine T *dth new ones which I obtained from the B.A.F. It is now in a fairly good working condition. But unfortunately soon after that, during a trip tb Dubai, its shaft broke. This was not the fault of the car as the shaft was an old one and was bent. I have now received the new shaft from Bahrain which I will have fitted on it. The food situation an the Trucial Coast is satisfactory at present. I have opened barter for barley and it is coming in substantial quantities. Our present stock of wheat is sufficient for t' T o months and our sugar for 3 months. After your departure I impressed on the Shaikhs to observe the strictest economy in the consumption of foodstuff which they willingly did. Although the Shaikh of Sharjah showed some reluctance, as he always does, I succeeded in convincing him that these measures are in his own and his people f s interest. I allowed the sugar of Abu Dhabi which was withheld by us as he was very helpful in a matter which I talked over with him. After releasing the sugar, I watched whether it goes to Abu Dhabi or not, and received reliable information that the sugar actually arrived at Abu Dhabi. I sent you some limes by courtesy of B.C.A.C. I hope they arrived in good condition, please let me know. If you or the P.A. want any moreCONFIDENTIAL URGENT. D.O. No. C/951. The 1st of October, l'J45. Dear Colonel Galloway, Please refer to your telegram No. A/1048, dated the 12th June, 1944, and subsequent correspondence on the subject of a 15-cwt. truck supplied for the Political Officer, frucial coast. 2. I should be grateful if you could give me permission to sell this truck without further delay. Murphy tells me that it is practically useless in the Trucial Coast conditions and if we do not sell it now, we will get very little for it. , \ &lt;; . ' r x f 3. There is also a Ford pick-up bought as long ago and as a result of Sir Geoffrey prior*s Demi-official letter No. C/422, dated the 4th September, 1941, to Major Alban. This is, of course, pretty shaky now, but I do not want to sell it as to do so would leave the Political Officer with practically no transport. I should, however be grateful if you would also give or obtain for me permission to use the money obtained from the sale of the truck for the purchase of a new pick-up. New ones will probably be available here within the next six months or so and as soon as we hear that a new one is available, the old one should then be sold. The proceeds from its sale can be used (i) towards the purchase of the new pick-up, if necessary, or (ii) to augment the Political Officer, Trucial Coast*s Car Fund, or (iii) as may seem appropriate.

I have told the Residency Agent of the Political Resident 1 s orders and have also told him that he will not be held responsible if, in spite of reasonable care being taken, the car is involved in a serious accident.
