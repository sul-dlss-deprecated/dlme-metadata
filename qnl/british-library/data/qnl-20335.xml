Furthermore regarding the question of Bin 3ubah. If I heglect him, disturbance is sure to take place in territo ries Hasa and Q.alif and amongst other tribesmen, as you are well aware they are of different elements and the longer question is delayed the worse it will be for me. It has also been mentioned to me that he has approached the Tuwalah of Shammar and tribesmen of. others of Shammar and others with the xtxiX evil intention of stirring up a moment. I am also preparing in like manner for a move from my side to resist any aggression. I would now therefore req-uest you to inform your Government of this. If any is c^r ^oiag to as a medium and settle the natter whi oh is pending between me and Bin Subah then we should put aside all ideas of aggression and wait; if the matter is to be settled between me and *in Subah direct, and the high Government does not wish to interfere, then I will hav^ to decide how I shall I act. I maj'- however mention that neither^/wish to fight Bin / Subah nor his people but he on the contrary seems to wish to quarrel. l r y object i^ only to avoid the occurance of an evil and see to the comfort LloT*my subjects.

On receipt of His Majesty's Government's message I at once complied with instructions contained therein and sent off to Mecca my cousin Ahmad ibn Thenyan_As-Saud ; I also permitted any person who wished to pay a visit to the Holy hous^of God to accom pany him, their number is very small, as I informed your Honour in my previous letter. This you have already read and must not have found very satisfactory.

After compliments. —As you are probably aware, and as I have before inform ed ' your honour, the present state of Arabia is due to the unsettled state of the world and the machinations of evil-do^rs, consisting mainly of Turkish Agents and their friends. To-day they are interfering with Syria and the people of 'Iraq and are simply playing fast and loose with its people by means of their tools the Sharif and his son. Long ago I pointed all this out to you. Further the Sharif and his sons have without ceasing been instigating His H/T * ^ /Y 6 * 1 * Majesty s officials against me out of sheer hatred for myself and in order to aggran dize himself at my expense ; their object being either to keep me busy or force me to join their party (the Nationalists). God willing they will fail. Regarding Bin Rashid. For long I have been trying to win his good will; but he avoids my advances ; because of the false hopes held out to him by the Sharif. Recently Bin Rashid's party showed their hand, coolness having arisen between us. The Sharif has now promised his support in money and arms. Muni tion and supplies have already reached Hail; more are about to leave from Madina. I have absolutely correct knowledge of this. Saiyid Siddiq Hasan himself has been shown my agent's letters to this effect. (Corroborated by Saiyid Siddiq Hassan in his recent reports from Riyadh.) Regarding Bin Sabah, outwardly he is apparently negotiating in a friendly manner, but secretly he is working against me. Outwardly all the above mentioned individuals pretend friendship with England but behind her back they are intriguing against her interests, and are benefiting themselves from external sources. They are thus making friends with the enemy, in case things go wrong. I, on the other hand, have played straight all along. Matters have now reached a crisis and I request your honour to help me, and explain the whole question to His Majesty's Government. Firstly His Majesty's Government can count on my steady friendship and assistance. Secondly, if they support me, I can assure them that I will never allow any onto'-English intrigue to go on in Centra? Arabia. If, however, I am to be treated like those who are playing the British Govern ment false, kindly let me know in order that I might stop troubing you further with commumcations and letters which have produced no effect so far. False people have now grown rich and gained lands through His Majesty's Government while I am left poorer than ever. My revenues are all mortgaged. To my agent in Bahrein, Abdul Aziz A1 Qusaibia alone, I owe over a lac of rupees. If I pay my revenues to my creditors this year, I shall be left without means to carry on my government. All the money that I have spent has been in the interests of the High Government.I have told you about this in detail before, I beg you to approacli His Majesty 's ernment to increase my subsidy and allow me more financial help. 1 must Government have an answer in order to know how 1 stand.

Annexure I to Enclosure III. No. 9, dated 29th July 1920. From— Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein, (on deputation at Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report below the gist of Bin Saud's long conversation with me last evening in his private majlis. Farhan Beg was also present. Bin Saud started by saying that the world was still very much disturbed « mU sharbak ' and that the British Government had a very difficult task to perform to restore peace and tranquillity, etc. There were troubles everywhere, India, E^ypt, Iraq, Syria and even England itself. The Government were not following a strong or correct policy such as is most essential for the peace and order especially of Arabia and Arab countries. The Government were too lenient and considerate to ensure respect and fear on Arabs' part. Their worst blunder was that really good, respectable and useful men were ignored and cast away while upstarts and mean whining impostors ' aradhil wa mutamalliqin ' were advanced, favoured and pamperecf. This was what the Turk did and ruined himself for ever. He often pondered over things and events and did not see that Government knew exactly ft who was their friend and who was an enemy. He went on to to say that, as he explained to you at length, it was not good policy on Government's part to seek to conciliate Arabs by heaping favours andgifts upon them especially when Government saw that they only got in return contumacy, intrigue and 'rebellion. Arabs could not be well governed except bv force mixed with justice. Constitutional Government such as was being thought of for Iraq will only bring more trouble and unrest and entail serious consequences which were not dreamed of at present. I here tried to put in a few words about the British having accepted a moral responsibility, as a Mandatory Power, of administering the country with the help and co-operation of the natives and gradually training them to look after their own affairs and that this was the matured judgment of the League of Nations and Peace Conference, etc., etc. Bin Saud, however, went on with his usual flow of eloquence. ' Look at the Sharif ' he said ' and his sons Faisal and Abdullah, what are they doing now ? I know for certain that they are extremely pampered (as they are) by the British Government. They are actually intriguing against and vilifying the English in Hejaz, in Syria and Palestine and in Iraq No one, he said, cared for or wanted either the Sharif or any of his sons ; still Government made so much of them and would go on supporting them. He had himself received letters and secret pamph lets from Faisal tempting and cajoling him to join them ; but he could not possibly do so. He could not afford to be unfaithful to his pledges or be disloyal to the British Government as long as they did not break their treaty with him. He has been always true to his word and will always be so, because his religion enforces loyalty to treaty obligations. He quoted from Quran 'Fastaqimu lahummasta^ qimu lakum ' ' [Be faithful to them (who are in treaty with you) as long as they are faithful to you]. He himself on the contrary was not cared for by Government. Even his sub sidy was stopped for two months which act of Government gave him the greatest chagrin. He had been granted thfs comparatively little monetary help (i'anah mali- vah) that is the subsidy in return for great sacrifices he had made for Government. He had only for their sake given up for ever the rich territories of Koweit, Bahrr in, Qatar and Oman all of which were his as having been conquerred by his grand-father Faisal. He could take possession of these lands at any time in the past 'and in the future but he must refrain from any such action which is contrary to treaty and opposed to the interests of his friend, the British Government. He has even now received letters from Syria, from Mosul and from Baghdad itself begging him to take over these places and rule over them or help them in establishing their own govern ment. He refused to listen to these appeals and temptations for Government's sake. Even at the present moment he has delegates here from Syria. He is beset with these difficulties and is doing his best; but he is disregarded by Government who do not help him, and at the same time he is called upon to perform an almost impossible task of holding in check a most turbulent mass of men the ' mutadayinah ' (Akhwan) whose numbers now come to no less than 100,000 men. The whole of Nejd is now by virtue of the religious -awakening, ' barkat-al-din ' so closely united as if all were one heart and soul and, as is too well known, they regard every other people as ' kafir wa mushrik ' (heretics and polytheists or idolaters) whose lives and properties were halal (allowable) to them. Who could check these fiery warriors in their burning religious zeal to spread their creed and conquer all who are near and around them ? Who can check them except God and Abdul Aziz ? They are all hungry (ja'anin) in want of food and clothing and money and he is at his wits' end how to supply their wants. It is with the greatest difficulty that he has been doing so far without any outside means or help from Government in whose interests, as well as his own, he was straining every nerve to work success^ fully and satisfactorily ' ashar al lail wa ajua bil nahar ' i.e., passing sleepless nig t and remaining hungry and abstaining from food by day. And what did His Majesty's Government do ? They put him 'down as a common, almost insignificant, little chief, a Badu in Central Arabia who knew nothing of the world. They regarded him as a junior, even a vassal to the Sharif whom they have made into ' Malik Husain ' and yet this king was still yesterday a subject of the Turks, called only ' Sharif-Mecca,' nominally ' Amir Hejaz ' with a Qaim Maqam's rank. He, Sharif, is being lavishly supplied with money tnd given all material help to an extent that he is not only himself living in ccmfortand luxury, but has enough to spare on outside intrigues in all the countries border ing on or in any way connected with the Hejaz. Large sums as bribes were being sent to Syria, to Iraq and Nejd, 'Asir, Najran, etc. Even Egypt had the advantage of this overflow of gold from Mecca. Difficulties were thus created for, and extra expenses caused to him, Bin Saud. It was as the result of the Sharif's intrigue, for instance, that he. Bin Saud, had to send a big expedition of 10,000 men to Najran and 'Asir under his cousin Abdul Aziz Ibn M us'aid who went out in Ramzan (2 months ago) and was still in 'Asir. The Sharif had incited Ibn Marai with bribes and letters and emissaries to commit several acts of hostility and high handed ness against the Imam Idrisi and also ill-treated Bin Sand's border tribes. Imam Idrisi had written to him (Bin Saud) for help and hence the expedition, both to help defending his distant tribes and his good friend the Idrisi. This expedition alone had cost him a large sum, the last amount despatched to Bin Mus'aid in 'Asir one day before my arrival in Riyadh, was £ 4,000 which, he called God to witness, was obtained on loan. He was heavily in debt and would have to seek mor^ loans although there was no prospect of easy borrowing in Nejd. Qusaibi (Abdul Aziz bin Hasan) alone was due Rs. 90,000 which figure was conveyed to Bin Saud in a letter brought by the man who escorted me from Hofuf to Riyadh. Qatif Ali bin Paris probably claimed a debt of Rs. 50,000. If His Majesty's Government had any regard for him, their sincere and loyal friend, it was time they helped him as he had already submitted matters to Government through the Political Agent, Bahrein. It was British Government who had tied his hands and his own nature and religion ' tabai' wa dini,' were forcing him to abide by his pledges ; otherwise his sheer needs and circumstances would rather have him break off and strike right and left near and far. He need only give the word ' Din ' and the whole of Jazirat-al-Arab would be overrun. His power could be fairly estimated from the fact that the three recent gazus (expeditions) of Ad-Darwish against Koweit, of Saud against Shammar and Bin Mus'aid against 'Asir consisted of 7,000, 15,000 and 10,000 men respectively, going almost simultaneously, and each of these was thoroughly successful. On my expressing a doubt as to whether these and similar gazus were justifi able according to the tenets of Islam and general principles of humanity. Bin Saud said that they were justifiable, necessary, and desira ble : firstly, they were sent out in self defence, he siid, to safeguard essential interests and to avenge wrong done to him and his people. Secondly his creed tells him to regard those Musal- mans who do not follow the real commandments (as the Wahabi does, he evident ly meant to say) as ' Murtad,' apostates, deserving a worse treatment than that meted out to ' Ahl-al-Kitab ' (people of' the book, namely followers of other revealed religions than Islam). The Muslims (Wah'abis were meant of course) were at liberty, nay commanded, to fight such pseudo-Mussalmans whom Quran called the ' Murtad,' apostates, and take their lives and property unless they became Muslims (rather Wahabis). The Sharif and the Hejazis were the worst of all these pseudo-Mussalmans, as they had all evils, smoking, drinking, debauchery and lawi.tah (unnatural crime) prevailing among them and they nad nothing of religion except name. Bin Saud then passed on the Sharif's incessant use of spies and ' muharrikin ' who were employed against Bin Saud. There were many of these in Nejd and Iraq, Jebel Shammar, Yemen, etc. Muhammad Al-Asaimi, Saiyid Talib, Salih ad- Da^histani were the chief of them. He once warned Sir Percy Cox against Saiyid Talib whom he described as ' Mai-Wabrah,' water of Wabrah (on the route from Iraq to Hail according to Farhan Beg), clear, bright, sweet to drink, but as soon as it goes into the stomach it causes a griping pain and motion. Such was the notorious Talib whom Government had now again allowed to return to Iraq. He also said that he had reason to suspect that Shaikh Salim was instigated by Talib and Khaz'al, both of whom were his old friends, but were by nature inclined to mischief. If nothing else Talib would love to get a chance of coming forward as an intermediary professing friendship and goodwill for both sides. Bin Saud wondered how and why this worthy was allowed to return to Iraq at all in these days when there were other disturbing factors in Iraq. These were the topics Bin Saud spoke about to his heart's consent, saying that he loved outspokenness or plain talk and that we were the persons he could best t ilk to, there being none in his own ' Hashiyah,' circle, with whom he could discuss such matters and unburden his mind. C546rD . 12 „He concluded by saying that his patience had nearly been exhausted as all his long representations which lie had been making to Government from time to time about the Sharif and about his own condition and requirements and aspirations had apparently passed away into oblivion, even the full and clear verbal communi cations he made to you in Ilassa in last winter did not bear fruit. I could only say that you had submitted everything perfectly clearly and fully to His Britannic Majesty's Government, and that they will doubtless give these matters their best consideration with, it may be hoped, good results in future. Annexure II to Enclosure III. Memorandum No. 10, dated 30th July 1920. From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion at Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report that Bin Saud today showed me two letters showing that the Sharif has sent Bin Rashid a big supply of arms and ammunition for fighting Bin Saud. One of the letters is anonymous which is written, Bin Saud says, by a secret informer of his living near Medina. It states that on Sunday the 3rd Dhil-Qaadah (20th July) the Sharif sent from Medina an emissary called Daghistani, with a message to Bin Rashid that his request could be met only as far as ammuni tion, arms and supplies went, and those would be supplied when wanted ; but that no force could be -sent from Hejaz to help Bin Rashid to fight against Bin Saud in any case (letter undated and unsigned). The second letter dated 6th Dhil-Qaadah (23rd July) from one Ibrahim bin Sukhaibar who, Bin Saud says, is a native of Riyadh sent secretly on pretence of beirg deported from Nejd having incurred Bin Saud's wrath. In tKis it is stated that writer had returned to Qasim leaving Medina on 2nd Dhil-Qaadah (19th July). Two days before he lelft Medina, Bin Rashid's emissaries had arrived there and were accorded a cordial reception and given valuable gjifts and present. The Sharif had set apart 7 camel-loads of gun (artillery) ammunition for sending to Bin Rashid. The day the writer was leaving one Amir, servant of Bin Rashid, also arrived at Medina, and he, too, was very well received. -He had brought letters from Bin Rashid and the Sharif promised to give him 6,000 boxes of arms and ammunition for Bin Rashid, also 6,000 boxes of gun powder. Camels were being ordered for carrying these to Hail when writer left Medina (on 19th July). On my expressing some doubt on the truth of the story, and the reliability of the writer of the letter in question, Ibrahim bin Sukhaibar, Bin Saud stated that the story might be a little bit exaggerated and in reality lesser quantities than those mentioned above might be given ; but that the man was reliable and is employed especially for secret information. Bin Saud added there were other news to hand from Qasim and elsewhere that Bin Rashid had received arms, ammunition and supplies from the Hejaz Government for fighting Bin Saud, and that he expected more definite information regarding the relations of the Shaiif and Bin Rashid, and latter's intended move on Nejd. Bin Saud said tlrs was the Sharif with whom His Majesty's Government wanted him, Bin Saud, to meet and discuss matters in a friendly way, and arrive at an amicable settlement of outstanding questions, which he knew was next to impossible as long as the Government allowed the Sharif to commit such acts of open hostility unchecked and unpunished. Annexure III to Enclosure III. Demi-official, dated the 31st July 1920. From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein, (on deputa tion, Riyadh), To— Major H. R. P. Dickson , C .I .E., Political Agent, Bahr in. We are ^till lying here in a terrible suspense as Bin Saud would not budge without a final reply to his last letter to you which is expected every hour. He 13 •talks a lot as you will see from two long reports T am sending you today (my Nos. 9 and 10). He is not at ail in good spirits though very kind to us. ^ esterday T had a little brush up with our friend Ahmad Thaniyan whom you know very well. In talkinpr of Bin Saud's affairs and Government's inattention (so called) he said ' Major J )ickson only forwards letters, he has no power, etc.' Both F;,rhan Beg and myself naturally felt annoyed as it was not only imperti nence but wrong and mischievous remark. On our talking rather sharply and telling him how much you had done for Bin Saud whose interests you had'made as your own, the gentleman changed at once and started to speak in a different strain—appreciation, gratitude and the like. : To my amazement Bin Saud himself said in the course of conversation in the evening (probably an echo of Ahmad Thaniyan's talk of the noon) that his agents in Bahrein, ' Wukalai fil Bahrain ' had written to say that Major Dickson did not if . • ^ take as much interest in his (Bin Saud's) affairs as formerly. We both argued the point and Bin Saud was evidently satisfied with our explanations. Farhan is f ^ positive that it is worthy Yusuf Kanoo doing petty mischief. He it is and not Qusaibi (as I thought) who must have written some trash to the Imam, who you know is so fond of getting news from any place or person. The truth of the matter is that poor Bin Saud is extremely bored and worried now-a-days as you will see from my reports and his own letter to you which he sent me to glance at just now. His indebtedness, increasing expenditure, the actions of Sharifs, Bin Rashid and Bin Sabah have all joined together to make Abdul-Aziz unhappy as he appears to me. He is even a bit nervous. In talking to the Kuwi it deputation yesterday morning he blushed red all of a sudden and spoke in greatly irritated, almost undignified, tone ' Take your camels away, there they are, as many as I could collect I cannot keep them as Shariah makes it haram for me to do so. Let Salim expect no good of me, no friendship or relations, all is over. As to Bin Rashid, before the month is out I shall be on his head in Hail.' Still Bin Saud is very kind and courteous to us. He sends for us daili/ about twice a day and also came and saw us in our room today. He took me round to his Madhif (guest house), his big toshakhana and the guests' dining hall. All these point out to a very large expenditure. I saw some dozen big degs each said to hold five zabihah sheep with rice, some scores of Badus dining and an equal number receiving the kisivah and busy putting the robes on as soon as handed to them by Ibn Shalhub and his lieutenants. The Imam looked at all this with much self satisfaction saying ' Hadha shughl Badu wa 'atao hum, ' etc. He would repeatedly say that this entertainment and presents of cloth and money went on daily and emptied his coffers. It is very interesting to note that in talking about general health and doctor for Riyadh Bin Saud said he was very anxious to have a doctor as soon as may be, be it an Indian or an Englishman, he only wanted a good man professionally and morally. I said an English doctor would be better, especially as a surgeon. I did not say but I know from experience that an Indian Muslim doctor (unless he is Wahabi and regular in prayers, fasting, etc., briefly actively religious) will be more hated than an Englishman, who will only have to avoid drinking to be tolerably liked here. Except for the heat Riyadh is a vey good place, only too much of t]:e religious mania, a stranger must expect to hear or overhear curses even in reply to salaam. My habit of prayer-saying has stood in good stead and I have perfoce made a ' Musalman ' of Farhan Beg who was less regular before. The heat and flies bv day make it very unpleasant. Nights are ideal, nice and cool and calm. Water is good and becomes icy cool in the skins covered with gunny bags—a great relief indeed. There are very good gardens, we have been inside of two of both the Imams. Grapes, dates, figs, water melon, hJiokhs are all very good and we at least, get plenty of them. The town is less dirty than Manamah but just under the soor there a e heaps of filth and rubbish. All is well except that we are rather sorry over the prospect of Haj —perhaps we my not get p. chance at all which will be very bad indeed, from all points of view. I hope all is well in Bahrein and that you are enjoying the best of health, by grace 148 / of God. Your orders are every moment awaited. I send this witli two other covers and Bin Sand's letter at 4 p. m . to-day, Saturday, 31st July 1920. Farhan Beg is doing splendidly and sends you his regards. \\ ith best wishes. As I am closing news is received from Asir that Bin Saud s cousin Abdul Aziz bin Mus'aid has captured Ubbaha or Ibbaha the chief town of Assir, and that Bin Marai has, after a severe defeat, fled to the hills. r i he report says that the number of garrison, etc., killed is greater than that at Taiabah last year and the town is now in Akhwans' hands. The ruler is a friend of the Sharif who will no doubt complain to Jeddah and Cairo although he is alleged to have started the quain by instigating Bin Marai, the ruler of 'Asir against the Idrisi and Bin Sand. Bin Sand is very glad of this. Riyadh, 31st July 1920. Annexure IV to Enclosure III. Demi-official, dated the 2nd August 1920. From—Kh mi Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein, (on deputa tion to Riyadh), To— Majoti H. R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahroin. Very many thanks for your kind note of 27th July 1920, which was delivered to me at 8 p.m . last evening. We were in terrible suspense and are only happy to find that Government has approved Bin Sand's suggestion to send a small mission. Both sides are, of course, actively inimical to each other up to the present moment, so much cannot be expected to come out of any interview, etc., still as things now are, this is the best that could be done. He was very glad to see that his proposal was approved, and easily, rather voluntarily, agreed to send off his mission with us on Thursday next, 5th instant. I am writing to you about this separately. A wise statesman, that he is, he wishes to try and mend matters even now as you will see from my memo, of date. But I may say that Bin Saud does not strike me to be quite sincere with Sharif—he abuses the poor old man like a rogue, and every Najdi does the same, so perfectly Bin Saud teaches his people his own views. I sent you rather lengthly reports of all what Bin Saud has talked to us and am sending two more today. I hope you will excuse me for writing at such a great length, but I feel I must tell you all I hear, hence the lengthy reports. I am handicapped in not having a camera or even knowing drawing well, so let me con tent myself with wori-piefcu ej o£ what I see t ,nd hea: in thid part of the world. The turning of faces, covering up of eyes, and muttering of half audible curses, is very little less than what you saw in Hasa—the pious Ikhwan cannot help it on seeing us. We bear up with it all, although Farhan at times becomes so much excited as to be likely to strike. He has also suffered a bit from the climate, heat by day and^cold by night, he is not down in bed, but js always with me when visiting the Imam or his sons, etc. I need not say that he is a great help, and I must thank you again for sending him with me. N He wants me to say that he remembers your advice and wishes, and will do his utmost to prove to your satisfaction (of which I am quite sure). With all his long valuable talks, self-praise and self aggrandisement, I find the Imam Abdul Aziz very polite and good natured. He always calls, at least once, often twice, a day and talks to us alone ' khususi.' I did not trouble him to fix the head of the mission and its members, etc.; he will do it soon I hope and we leave here for Mecca on 5th August. It will be a terribly hurried journey in such a hot time of the year but it cannot be helped. We rely on God. With all good wishes and our joint respects 159 Aunexure V to Enclosure III. Memorandum No. 12, dated the 31st July 1920. From Khai Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion, Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report that just now, 6 a.m. a 'bashir ^carrier of good news—arrived and is received, as usual, with firing of rifles (about 20 shots). His good news is, I gather, that the Ikhwan of the villages of Sufainah and Suwairiqiyah, ' who had been sent^out on a ghazu by the Imam ' Bin Saud (my informer's words quoted) against Bani Abdullah, a section of Mutair, have gained a victory. The Ikhwan have captured the town, or village, of Bani Abdullah (Mutair) called Al-Harrah, which is said to be near Medina, to the west of Medina. Further particulars will be reported if given me by Bin Saud. P.S.—Fiom this and previous reports I have submitted, it will be seen that Bin Saud has at the present moment no less than three ghazus, expeditions, out against Hejaz and 'Asir. I will submit fuller report as soon as I get sufficiently clear and reliable information, which is by no means easy, as I notice every one is so reticent and few are allowed near us. Annexure VI to Enclosure III. Memorandum No. U-C., dated 1st August 1920. From— Kh in Sah : b Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion to Riyadh), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report the following few facts which I hope will be found interesting On the afternoon of Ist August, when I was calling with Farhan on Bin Saud, I noticed unusual bustle in his maktab, office, where there were three clerks writ ing what seemed lists of things, and several persons coming in and going out again and again, some coming up to Bin Saud and whispering something into his 'ear and receiving replies and orders in the same fashion in whimper. I said (getting oppor tunity of one quiet moment which is, as you know, so rare when you are sitting with Bin Saud who goes on rattling one ^ thing or another without stopping to breathe, so to say) I said that I hope he had received a reply, made up his mind and was ordering preparations for Haj. Bin Saud replied that he was letting some of his men to prepare to go out and was ordering necessary supplies for them as he had received news that Bin Rashid had already left Hail for the south. Briefly this means that Bin Saud is now preparing to send another ghazu, expedition, against Ibn Rashid. It will probably be led by Faisal-ad-Dawaish. The pre vious evening Farhan Beg was present when Bin Saud called up a Badu and gave him a letter, spoke some words of encouragement and the like and told him to start of immediately with the letter and deliver it to Ad-Dawaish with salaams. Bin Saud was rather reserved this afternoon, but a few appropriate queries by me elicited this much more : Ibn Rashid had cmie down to a place (I forget name) where there is good water and grazing for camels, and Shammar Badus usually congregate in summer : it is situated on the borders of Bin Sand's and Koweit territory : the object is obviously to try and retaliate the recent ghazu of Saud* •Meaning doubly naughty. He himself tells Bu -b harrain Bin Saud s son at Shuaibah, me he borrowed this name from a slave of theirs and also in response to Salem P.S -Sabah's £ :^:z::TX A ' a , ' y he adopted : eq r t8 and a pp e . a1 / f ? r : ^ bent upon mischief, ' sharr, ' he knew positively, and being forewarned, he ought to became fore-armed. Bin Saud went on to say that it was Aqab bin Ajil, the maternal uncle of Saud the late Emir of Hail, who had usurped all authority at Hail, and who was following this hostile policy towards him. Bin Saud, failing to realize that it would only be suicidal to them, as he was more than a match for them all put together, etc.. etc. c546fd 16At this juncture Bin Sand showed me an anonymous letter (written in a good literary style, so rare now-a-days in these parts) informing Bin Sand (with the highest imaginable compliments and many prayers quoted from the Quran) that both Bin Rashid and Bin Sabah had just sent letters to the Sharif (King Husain) through Salim Saderawi, a big Arab merchant of Bombay, bitterly complaining of Bin Saud's acts, etc., and asking for alliance and help. The writer wondered what the Sharif could do at all for these poor beggars ' and cursed them for their folly in making the request or appeal (the anonymous writer must be some well- read person or 'alim in Koweit, I think). I expresed surprise and said that such a request, if made, could be of little avail, but was futile. Bin Saud, who had by this time returned to his usual flow or volubility of speech, went on to say that such were the habits of Arab Chiefs who would never rest or left their neighbours rest, but must go on quarreling and fighting, robbing and killing. It was the duty of the British Government as a friendly protecting power to give serious attention to Arab affairs. He had expressed his views at great length in the course of his meeting with you (Major Dickson) and to late Captain Shakespear and Mr. Philby previously, also to Sir Percy Cox himself. He had since been writing drawing His Majesty's Government's attention from time to time to the unsatisfactory condition of the Jazirat-al-Arab ; but nothing came out of it all. His representations were disregarded, his friendship and good will which prompted those sincere expressions of wishes, and true faithful advice, were all set at naught. He was now feeling disappointed, nay almost affronted, as if he was put down as ' khafif ' (lit. irresponsible) of little importance, or c&lt; jahil ', ignorant. It was quite clear to him that Government failed to appreciate him, and to realize his position, while they had made Husain bin Ali, that poor beggar with no qualities of the head or heart, ' miskin, faqir, darwesh allazi ma induh aql, wa la induh qalb,' the king and were trumpetting him all over the world as ' Al-Malik, Al-Malik,' the king the king Why did the English not see, he wondered, that if there was any one in Jazirat-al-Arab fit to be styled ' King,' it was he himself, although within himself he was proud of being called Bin Saud. He could, if he wished, become the virtual king of whole Arabia, he who took his forefathers' capital Riyadh, back from Bin Rashid, attacking it with only a hand ful of forty camel-riders, ' Rai arbain dhalul ', and drove the Turk from Hassa in circumstances which were known to the whole world. Perhaps he had been writing too much and too often, but he was forced by circumstances to do so. He knew Government was very busy, but it could not be so busy as not to return him one clear satisfactory reply to all his propositions. Here I interposed saying, I knew the whole correspondence and did not see what letters or communications of his remained un-answered : everything was - given immediate attention and passed on to higher authorities and back, etc., etc. He said that as long as affairs were subject to reference between Bahrein and Baghdad and Cairo and London and Simla and London, mistakes are bound to occur, and reality of matters cannot be understood. Those authorities sitting at a great distance could not know the exact nature or real importance of his or other Arabs' affairs. He would rather have Government appoint a sort of Arab Board or Committee of two or three high, impartial officials who should know all about Arabs and Arabia. They should be permanently stationed at a central place, say, Bushire or Baghdad, and fully empowered to examine and decide all questions or disputes now existing or in future arising between Arab Rulers, and their decisions should be accepted and enforced as final, allowing appeal to London in rare cases only. He concluded by saying that his was a far cry which Govern ment did not hear, but that he had nearly lost patience, and would write only one more letter saying that he would not trespass upon British rights or interests, nor would he trouble those who are in treaty alliance with Government but short of this he must do as he might like to support himself and the masses dependent Upon him for full maintenance. To my mind he seems impatient of the control on him burning to expand and conquer for which he is fully equipped being able to throw a mass of fiery zealots (his own creation, Ikhwan) on to any part of the country. As he says, he need not to move even an inch himself, but give the word, and Arabia will be ablaze. If there is a remedy, I believe it is only a sufficiently enhanced subsidy for Bin • Saud, who is, in my humble opinion, worth anything.11 Annexure VII to Enclosure III. Memorandum No. 15-C., dated the 2nd August 1920. From—Khan S ihib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputation to Riyadh). To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I received your letter of 27th July 1920, last night at 8 p.m . and Bin Saud has also received your letter embodying Government's approval of his proposal to send a mission to Mecca at once. I beg to thank you for conveying the reply, which, fortunately, is quite in time. I, accompanied by Farhan Beg, went to Bin Saud immediately on reading your letter and found Bin Saud pleased with your reply accepting his proposal. He said I was fortunate to go to Haj, and that although much time had been lost in receiving the Government's approval, yet he felt very much relieved and obliged to Government, to Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson, and yourself, for this favour able answer to his late proposal. He then spoke about the general condition of the way the difficulty of travel ling in this hot season and the general unfriendly attitude of the King of H3jaz to wards himself and the people of Nejd. He said that the party would be quite safe up to Ashairah on the border of Nejd, but that farther than that we sould have to rely on God and the Sharif. He remarked laughingly that we doubtless valued our lives sufficiently to care about the matter and ask Government to persuade the Sharif to proivde escort from Ashairah to Mecca. I would therefore, request that if you agree with Bin Saud in thinking that an escort is necessary to take us further, you will kindly refer to the Civil Commis sioner, Baghdad, telegraphically, and have necessary arrangements made in this behalf. Bin Saud has fixed Thursday, the 19th Dhil-Qaadah (5th August 1920), for the departure of the Nejd mission to Mecca. Further particulars, as to who will be in charge, number of men. etc., will be reported as soon as fixed, in any case before I leave Riyadh. We will have to travel very fast to reach in time for the Haj. It is gratifying to note that Bin Saud told me definitely that he will send the most conciliatory and respectful letters, with us, to King Husain and Sharif Abdullah, and will also send some suitable presents, probably two thoroughbred mares. Even in this interview, although he was in very good spirits and jovial mood. Bin Saud made a few remarks of the nature already reported at length. He said he was doing all this for Government's sake, and only to please His Majesty's Government. He did not see much use in doing this, but he clung to the hope that the Sharif would perhaps see the futility of continuing the quarrel. It was a pity the Government did not fully appreciate him, or realize his position. He was not only belittled, but tied hand and foot and let to lie down. By their present policy Government caused a loss to themselves, to him, and to Arabs. Syria and Iraq were up struggling to oust the English, he on the contrary, only allowed more and more rope to Arabs. They will soon become uncontrollable when Government will see too late that not only sheathe British Government), but Bin Saud is a great loser. Independent strength and power of Syria and Iraq would only mean proportionate weakness of him, Bin Saud. If let alone he could control them to the advantage of the British Government, but if she does it herself, so much the better.' # p ^5.—Although he would not say in plain words, it is clear from these remarks as well as those alteady reported that Bin Sand's mind is exercised by the idea of bidding for the headship of Arab Rulers, and more specially of being constituted or appointed something like a Rais or President of the newly born Arab States of Syria and Mesopotamia. He has not ^ttered the word Palestine a§ yet, as far as I can remember, in his half a dozen long coversations of this kind with me. He himself says that it is impossible for him to rule over the Arabs of Meso potamia, Syria, Hejaz, etc., as he cannot derate their religious or social customs or habits for one moment ; nor can he possibly convert them all to his own creed unless. is10 it were by general massacres of thousands of them, which he declares to be un thinkable for him. One can only gather that what he does want is some kind of big name and style 'King,' ' Sultan,' ' Rais ' or what not to proclaim to the broad world his greatness or superiority over all Arabs. Only one thing more would make Bin Saud happy and contented, that is money, which he clearly lacks at present. Enclosure IV to Serial No. 37. t Confidential memorandum No. 257-C., dated Bahrein, the 15th-17th August 1920. , From— Major H. R. P. Dickson , C .I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. Shaikh PTam^d bin Isa eldest son of l^uler of Bahrein, called upon me vester- day with Shaikh Junu.a of Dabai. Both spoke very disparaginly of Bin Saud and the Ikhwan. Shaikh Hamad reported the latest madness (as he called it) of Bin Saud was that he had issued strict orders to Bin Jaluwi, Emir of Hasa, that in future the Shiahs of Hasa and Qatif were to be forbidden to hold religious readings (Qaraiyahs) in their Hussainiyahs and that at Muharram all ceremonies in connexion with the death of Husain were to be banned. ' The order,' said Shaikh Hamad, ' had created the greatest consternation and fury among Hasa and Qatif Shiahs.' , Unless the order were rescinded, Shaikh Hamad thought rebellion was sure to follow Certainly an appeal to Great Britain would be made by Shiahs. It was a similar policy in Faisal's time that brought about Turkish intervention in Hasa, and now Bin Saud was mad enough to try and imitate his grandfather's mistake. Shaikh Jumaa spoke in a similar strain saying how alarmed the people of Dabai were at Bin Saud's increasing power. Shaikh admitted that near Rasa! Khaimah there existed a strong Wahhabi centre today. These were in direct communication with Bin Saud, and were becoming a menace to the peace of the Trucial coast. ^ Shaikh Hamad further reported that a section of the Ajman had been bribed by Shaikh Salim to leave ibn-Hidhlain's camp and go into Koweit territory See my telegram No. 243-C., dated the 15th August 1920. The recalcitrant section had emerged on 10th instant and raided a camp of the Manasir close to Qatif returning in safety with many camels. ' 2. A significant fact is that Shaikh Hamad until a short time was a hot sup porter of Bm baud. Since Bin Shamlan from Koweit visited Bahrein Shaikh Hamad has changed his politics. In this connection please see my No. 239-C. dated 12th August 1920, paragraph 10, I personally look upon the whole Qatif and Hasa story with suspicion At the same time, undoubtely Shaikh Salim is intriguing deeply in these parts his endeavours being to create an anti-hm Saud atmosphere in Bahrein. Monev judiciouly spent m Qatif might easily result in an outbreak, for the Oatifi Shiih is not particularly fond of the Bin Saud regime. In this connection also see Koweit s telegram No. 68-C., dated the 28th July 1920 in which he reports likelv trouble m Hasa. The report emanated from Shaikh Salim an looks as if it was a casV of i he wish being father of the thought. Apart from Shaikh Hamad and Shaikh Abdullah's reports, I have heard of no such alleged orders of Bin Saud against the Shiahs complained of. Nor havp a™ local Shiahs mentioned it to m« here. ^ (3) Local rumour has it that Bin Shamlan presented £ 5,000 to Shaikh Isa from Shaikh Salim. I do not credit the report. A more likely story is that the money was sent to Qatif, while to Shaikh Isa came only the ordinary ' Ladiah as from mler to ruler.

From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein, (on deputa tion with the Nejd Mission, Riyadh), To— Major H-R. P. Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrein. I have already written to you yesterday that our departure for Mecca was de layed, and thus we are to leave Riyadh tomorrow Saturday, 7th August 1920 (21st Dhil-Qaadah 1338). All the choicest requisitioned have, I am told, arrived today and all is ready for the journey which for want of time has evidently become still more arduous in itself. 'Tawakkalan ala Allah,' as the Arab says, we trust in God. The mere fact that we are going, a mission from Bin Saud to Sharif, gives one immense satisfaction. To tell you the truth there was little hope of it as you will see from my last report of' yesterday's date. It is also satisfactory to note that the Naib, Ahmad Thaniyan, is now distinctly better or more sober in his talk or opinions about the Sharif. He is, if I am not mistaken fairly promising and reasonable and will, it is hoped, make matters smooth. The schism or gulf between the two sides is terribly wide, perhaps too wide to be bridged. One can only hope for the best. As Bin Saud is not with us and it is only a Naib in the person of Ahmad Thaniyan I have adopted Farhan Bag's proposition of our own separate mess, etc. The Imam is said to have ordered the general stores, supplies, etc., for the party but I am buying some provisions and sundries, also a few abbas. It will all hellp to give us a sort of independent character in the eyes of the Arabs and also be useful to draw men and get information. That interesting individual Ibn Shalhoob (who by the way is the son of a settler in Riyadh from Haleb, Syria) comes and tells us just now that the Imam will' Send us armed.' This will be irony of fate ; instead of having the whole Nejd pilgrim party unarmed for the satisfaction of the Sharif, we our selves are to go armed. Of course any arms that Bin Saud might give us will be for the journey and intended for show, as usual. I have seen old Imam, Abdur Rahman, who, somehow, succeeded[in shaking off his £&lt; piety ' and condescended to receive us both with more than expected courtesy. He talked of old Indian Ulema, one (last and best known) of them being Maulvi Siddiq Hasan Khan, who rose from the modest position of an ordinary aalim to be Chief Secretary of the last Begum of Bahopl, and latterly married the Begum, re ceiving as a necessary adjunct the title of Nawab. Perhaps the mere chance that I possess the same name as the late Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan of Bhopal, ensured a kind reception for me from this old Imam, who is, naturally a bigoted Wahhabi. Saud, the eldest son, favourite and heir-apparent of Abdul Aziz is a charming youth of 19 or 20 years. He is very affable and may be a near approach to his eminent father later on. He said, he would some day like to'go to Wilayat (England) for a tour. Faisal is rather backward or too young to show any marked qualities. The rest are all poor desolate souls—hopeless bigots, and foolishly disgustingly GWtfi-foreign. ' Bin Saud is writing to Qusaibi to be quick with the light-buoy in Ojair harbour. When I spoke to him he said he had ordered it long ago, and he was glad to learn That P. W. D. man was sent by you to survey. He will write to you on the subject. About our return Bin Saud has repeatedly expressed the desire that we should come back via Riyadh ; but I cannot say nor have I promised him. It will depend on circumstances.^ As it is the journey to Mecca in this hot season and with so deadly a haste is'as much as one can bear. Thank God, we are both keeping fairly fit. Hope you are enjoying good health. We both very much wish to see you in Bahrein on our return. With our respects and good wishes, Enclosure III to Serial No. (40).

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your memorandum No. 25o-V.—0., dated the 23rd July 1920, which reached me in Riyadh on 1st instant, while the 15 books of 21forms for registration of country craft forwarded therewith, have been delivered to me only this morning, having arrived last night. I have explained the use of these forms to Bin Saud and have requested His Excellency kindly to send the books in due proportion to his ports of Qatif, Ojair and Jubail for use there. I am glad to report that Bin Sard has after some discus sion, agreed to order the registration of Najd, Hassa and Qatif dhows at an early date and is sending the books of forms to the Amirs in the above three ports with letters of instructions to enforce registration. I have at his request filled up one form to serve as sample. Enclosure IV to Serial No. (40). Memorandum No. l^-C., dated the 20th Dhil-Qaadah 1338 (Gth August 1920). From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa- » tion with the Nejd Pilgrimage, Riyadh), To-—The Political Agent, Bahrein. I beg to report the following items of news, etc., which have partly been gleaned in conversation with Bin Saud and others, and partly obtained by means of secret informers :— (1) Reference my memorandum* No. 12 of 1st instant (31st July ?), I received secret information that Abdullah bin Abdur Rahman, Bin Saud's brother, received a letter on 1st August, informing him of the Ikhwan victory^over Bani Abdullah, 'and capture of Al-Hurra, west of Medina. The latter stated that the Ikhwan killed 400 of the inhabitants and did not spare women and children. Qn reading this, Abdullah is said to have spoken to those present, expressing his disgust and horror saying that this was not in Islam, that such brutality was not permitted in any religion, and that he feared the Ikhwan will sooner or later incur God's wrath. When visiting Bin Saud the same afternoon, I waited to hear something of it, but when nothing was mentioned by him, I said I had heard firing of some 20 shots early in the morning and wondered what was the matter. Bin Saud said, ' Oh, it was a trifling thing. A man has come with news of some Ikhwan ghazu and success over Bani Abdullah ; the man calls it busharah (happy news) and wants a 44 dhalul ' (riding camel) as his own died on the way ; 1 shall give him one—a common thing.' It will be noticed that Bin Saud did not like to enlighten me on the subject for the obvious reason that this might be reported to His Majesty's Government as one of his (or Ikhwans activities against Hejaz). -(2) Reference previous reports. Bin Saud has now received letters from 'Asir saying that the Ikhwan, under Abdul Aziz bin Musaid as Saud, have gained - complete victory. They have captured Hajlah and Ubbaha or (Iblaba) the capital of ? Asir, after a siege of ten days. Two thousand of the garrison and inhabitants are reported to have been killed, but the ruler, Bin Marai, escaped to the hills. Ikhwan loss reported to be 15 men killed and 4 horses. The Akhwan are in occupa tion and Bin Musaid has appointed Amirs of towns and villages from among the inhabitants themselves. He has offered to restore the town and everything else looted or captured provided that Bin Marai and his people become Moslims (Ikhwan). Imam Idrisi, advised by the late Turkish Wali, who is said to have managed some how or other to remain on, is co-operating with Bin Saud's forces, and giving them moral and material help, the reason being that the Imam idxisi is very friendly to Bin Saud, and an enemy of the Sharif who is said to have instigated the ruler of 'Asir to commit certain aggressive acts against both the Idrisi and Bin Saud. Above is nearly fully confirmed by Bin Saud in conversation. (3) The Ikhwan and their ulema (learned men or priests) are no less a source of anxiety and worry to Bin Saud than a satisfaction in having so many of them as a ready weapon. On the evening of the 3rd instant I heard (from my quarters, which are separated by a wall from the evening majlis of the Imam) him deliverimg a long address in loud harsh tone : ' You have to obey God and His Prophet (peace of God be on his soul'). He always repeats this pious phrase when speaking orreferring to the Holy Prophet)— &lt;c And you have to obey me according to Kitab- Allah (Book of God, Al-Koran) and ' Sunnat Rasuleh ' (recorded customs and traditions of the Prophet. Next morning when I was calling on him, I complimented him as doing the duty of an Imam in addition to his arduous task as a ruler. Thereupon Bin Saud said that he had no rest or peace, he would rather forsake the world and go and live peaceably in a small island if he could, and would fly from his present environments which were so much taxing his energies and weighing him down. He did not even enjoy the ordinary night's rest in his harem, but often passed sleepless nights. The Shaikh (meaning Ab dullah bin Abdul Latif, the chief Alim, Qazi and Mufti of Riyadh) was annoyed and disappointed with the Ikhwan Ulema, as they preached against every body and everything outside their narrow circle and exhorted their followers to shid- dah ' (aggression or use of force). They even strongly criticised him, Bin Saud, for his friendly relations with ' ajanib(foreigners). He had a most difficult task to perform to maintain friendly relations with rule s and powers. Unlike his predecessors, he had to live in treaty relations with powers, like the British, whom he liked for their justice and fair-dealing, otherwise, as Christians, he should forsake and shun them ' Abri ila-Allah minhum '. He had called some ten of these Ulema to wait on the Shaikh and to conciliate him. He had already been with them to the Shaikh on the previous evening when the Shaikh could not be pro pitiated ; but that very morning he had effected a full compromise. The Ikhwan Ulema had solemnly promised to the Shaikh as their spiritual head (Bin Saud, it may be noted here, most wisely ignores himself for a moments, acts as a go- between, and keeps in the back-ground, as, after all, he is only their ruler, and does not stand in the religious bigot's mind for quite as much respect and devotion as does a spiritual head—Shaikh) that they will attend to and settle all cases sent to them by him, and will only refer back to him in case of real doubt or difficulty ; that they will preach in mosques only on subjects or topics of a purely religious nature which will be previously noted down for thern by the Shaikh himself ; that they will without fail, come to Riyadh and receive instructions from the Shaikh at short intervals ; that they will say nothing to what Bin Saud said or did in poli tical external matters or about his relations outside Nejd. With immense influeDce that this Shaikh has over all in Nejd, the above is, I think, the best remedy and safeguard Bin Saud could possibly apply or devise against rampant Ikhwanism which, one is often lead to think is fast getting out of hand control of even so strong and perfect an Arab ruler as Abdul Aziz bin Saud himself. (4) There is a surprisingly large number of men coming to Bin Saud daily from all sides. These visitors really mean a great deal of expense, as, according to the Arab custom, they are all guests, not excluding litigants, who come to fight their own cases or answer charges, and are not only fed, but given £&lt; kiswah ' (robes) and other ' ikram ' (cash present, arms, etc.). One of these is an Abbas al Fallaj from Syria, arrived 10 days ago. is said to have brought letter (whether from Emir Faisal or other leading men, it cannot be as certained. Bin Saud, however, mentioned to me in the course of his conversations that in addition to the pressure laid by His Majesty's Government, he knew that much pressure was brought to bear upon the Sharif from Syria, urging him to try and make peace with him. Bin Saud). This man is said to have come here twice before. He is camping out near the Imam's garden, north of the town, and appears to be of some importance as he has 5 horses and several attendants with him. Some of these daily visitors come with cases and complaints of a serious nature, or inter-tribal disputes, other, for mere ' wajah ' (seeing) Imam, which means a begging visit, to get money or help. But a large proportion are evidently news letters-carriers, who come from far and near. Fine, though evidently expensive, intelligence system is thus created and maintained by the Imam. As ^oon as a man ' nawwakh ' (dismounts from his camel), he is reported by means of a little slip, which is written and sent up by a clerk, always present at the gate (of which I am enclosing two samples herein) and is Slips detained m tins oihce. immediately called up and seen by Bin Saud himself, though for a couple of minutes. His verbal news, or message or letter, as the case may be, is received, and he is sent off to the ' mudhif guest-house. Ordinary visitors are sent away after a day or two of their arrival with ' ikram while others remain according to their business or object of visit, are granted privateinterviews or received in audience in a big well furnished hall and eventually sent back with suitable presents of cash, cloths, arms, etc. All this goes on daily in a perfectly regular methodical way which itself is creditable and characteristic of this wide-awake ruler. (5) Yesterday Bin Saud mentioned two things, both of which seem to be fresh light he has received. Why, he said, he wondered, Thamir-al-Mansur and Yusuf-al-Mansur, were arrested and imprisoned by Government. The latter was possibly an intriguer and agitated against the English as result of a^i-British and cm^-Foreign propaganda from Syria, but the former is up to nothing, he is harmless. Farhan Beg replied that he did not know anything of it, but that these two might be of thejoolish lot who were uselessly trying to get independent government not knowing that they were not fit for it in any sense. The second thing was r Bin Saud said, he had learned that Government had started to send cases for decision or arbitration to Saiyid Talib, who was also employed occasionally in settling diffi cult tribal disputes, etc. If this was true the Government were making a mistake as this would give Talib his longed for opportunity of gaining influence, which was wholly undesirable, for Talib if ever he gets any hold on people, must indulge in his old pastime of intrigue, and against whom will that intrigue be directed ?— against the British Government itself. This he said. Government would find to be a true prophe.sy sooner or later. I am afraid that I am becoming rather prosiac in reporting these remarks and the like ; but I prefer to try and let you know all 1 hear, rather as much of the interesting talks of this interesting gentleman, as I can remember, and be reminded of by my companion, Farhan Beg, who is very helpful to me. Enclosure V to Serial No. (40). Memorandum No. 18-C., dated 5th-6th August 1920. From—Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan , Indian Assistant, Bahrein (on deputa tion with the Nejd Pilgrimage, Camp Riyadh), To—I'he Political Agent, Bahr in. I beg to report that since the receipt of your letter of 27th July 1920 embody ing Government's approval of Bin Saud's proposal to send a mission to Mecca although Bin Saud had expressed his satisfaction and pleasure on the Civil Com missioner's answer yet a tendency was noticed on his part to minimize the advantage of the proposed mission and for the greater part of severely criticizing and blaming (if 1 may say abusing) King Husain. The curious part of it was that Bin Saud did so in hi&gt; private conversation with Farhan Beg and myself and at the same time repeatedly said that he had been telling his people quite different that is good things about the Sharif so that their feeling might be softened and the Haj and a rapprochement made easier, etc. He would not for two days (during 4 interviews) after receipt of the above reply of Civil Commissioner appoint or declare whom he was going to depute, nor the number of men he would send to Mecca. Under these circumstances I asked for a special interview in the evening and accompanied by Farhan Beg saw Bin Saud alone on 3rd instant. After ordi nary exchange of inquiries after health and comfort and usual civilities, I said that I had been waiting to hear his orders and decision about the mission which he had himself proposed as the last resort and which on receipt of your letter on 1st instant, he had promised to despatch with us on Thursday the 5th instant and that I should like to write and inform you of the definite decision, etc., in good time. Bin Saud replied that he had the matter in view but that as he had been telling us he did not see much use, etc. I then asked for his kindness and courtesy to let me speak about the matter and he said ' Samm ' that is ' Bismillah ' do so. I then slowly and cautiously re viewed the whole history in brief of the differences and disputes between him and the Sharif as I had seen the correspondence going on on this. Bin Saud-King Husain, subject for the last 2 years especially reminding him of his own letters and communi cations submitted to Government through Bahrein pointing out that he himselfhad been incessantly and bitterly complaining against various alleged aggressive acts of the King of Hejaz who in turn had been equally frequently complaining of similar hostile acts of his, Bin Saud's ; both had sought a remedy and he himself had submitted definite proposals ; his proposals had from time to time been fully considered by His Majesty's Government and at least three different courses seriously adopted or decided upon and then altered and modified only to meet his own wishes and convenience. (I was, of course referring to (1) the meeting at Aden, (2) Bin Saud going at the head of his people by land and meeting King Husain personally at or near Mecca (3) Bin Saud sending a representative with a friendly mission to Mecca). I also pointed out that you (Major Dickson) and the Civil Commissioner Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, C.M.G., D .S.O., etc., had taken so much trouble in explaining matters to His Britannic Ma esty's Government, making favourable recommendations and generally furthering his interests in every way, practically making his cause their own, and that it would be a great pity indeed if this latest proposal proved a failure. I must say that in this conversation my companion, Farhan Beg-al-Rahmah, whom I had instructed before hand, took a very active and useful part inasmuch as he in his own rough and ready Arab way, practically convey ed the opportune threat (in an affectionate manner, using the words ' ya n ahfuz, ya tawil al umr which so much appeal to an Arab mind) that if he dilly-dallied at this last moment and the chance of Haj for Nejdis and of attempting a friendly settlement or negotiations with the Sharif was lost then he. Bin Saud, will not only lose the sympathies of his powerful friends Colonel Wilson and Major Dickson, but would seriously offend His Majesty's Government, who had already exercised too much patience with him, and pressed the Sharif to acquiesce, etc. To this I signi fied my agreement in suitable words saying this was the time for him to prove to Government the bona fides of his intentions towards King Husain and requests to Government. In short, the result was very favourable and Bin Saud declared that he had, as already promised to me on receipt of your letter on 1st irstant, definitely decided to send a friendly mission headed by one of the Saud (ruling) family. After a little more talking, he declared he would send Ahmad Thaniyan with a very small number of men and will, for the sake of Government, write extremely conciliatory letters and send presents to King Husain and Sharif Abdullah and that he could only hope that good will come of all this and he more than any one else, loved peace and tranquillity, etc. He has ordered Ahmad Thaniyan to be ready to start at once and make all necessav preparations. On the whole, I think, this is a good selection as this gentle- mo n is fairly well read and amenable to reason. He has been to see me twice and we have talked of our business. I think he will do well. The number .going from Rivadh is now practically fixed up and comes to about 150 men, all Haddar, the delegate being only Ahmad Thaniyan, the others are only Ha j is. We may be expected to be joined by about so many, possibly more, as we proceed. Neither Bin Saud. nor Ahmad Thaniyan, can tell how many will Haj, but I gather the im pression that the aggregate will not exceed a few hundreds, it may only be 300 to 400 men, as there is very short time left and only the happy owner of a first rate riding camel can reach in time fo ' the Haj. It is the selection of best dromedaries that has delayed us. W T e are now timed to start on Saturday morning 7th August 1920=21st Dhil-Qaadah 1338, expecting to arrive in Mecca on 21st August= 4th Dhil Haj j. The journey has, thus to b^ performed in great haste in the shortest possible time. • I trust you will kindly inform the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad to have neces- sary warning sent telegraphically to His Britannic Majesty's Agent at Jeddah, Indian Political Officer, Jeddah, and His Majesty King Husa in inorder to have the mission met at Asherah, as Bin Saud has desired.

Just two lines to let you know that we have after all started off for Mecca, thank God. We with a party of ten, that is five slaves and three attendants, Farhan and myself, left Riyadh at 5 a.m . this morning and arrived here at about 9 a.m. 25Ahmad Thaniyan and Iris party of Hajis were to join us liere and their kit has just arrived (3 p.m .). They join us at the ' asha ' dinner 7 p.m ., and We start off with our whole-night marches of which first comes off to-night. Thanks to Farhan Beg's open mouthed talk, I have been given a good kajawah to sit or lie in and hope to be tolerably comfortable, if comfort can be had in travelling across Arabia in summer. Last night when we took leave of the Imam, he spoke very kindly and urged us both to ' stick to Ahmad Thaniyan ' and return via Kiyadh. He said he would write to you and promised to pass letters up and down, if any were sent by or to you. I will try and keep you posted from the route. I am still in the dark about the number of our party. Kindly bear us bobh in mind. Farh^tn has rather frightened me by a casual remark, but I do hope and wish that I shall find you in Bahrein on our return. Of course your own kindness of heart is a security that you will not forget your humble subordinate and sincere friend and admirer. The slaves of Bin Saud are just leaving for Riyadh so I close in hurry. With best respects and all good wishes for your health and prosperous life. Enclosure VII to Serial No. (40).

The object in writing this cordial letter and submitting the same to your Highness is to enquire after your Honour's health. My condition will please you in every respect and nothing important has occurred which may be worthy of mention to your Highness. x I bave agreed that our friends the High British Government should be the means of mediation between us and I have requested them to bring about and establish friendly relations between my Government and that of your Highness ; although in fact there does not seem to be any reason whatsoever why any dispute should exist between us, as I look upon your Highness as an affectionate father. I, therefore, have decided to send my cousin Ahmad al-Thaniyan as-Saud as a special representative to present himself before your Highness with those who are in his company from the side of His Majesty's Government namely Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan and Farhan Beg Al-Rahama two of their good men. Your Highness will kindly acquaint the aforesaid with what is in your mind, our object being to remove all differences and arrive at a settlement of all out standing questions, and also to establish friendly relations, and strengthen the bonds of friendship and to carry into practice good relations between our two countries. I pray to Almighty God, to grant us our desire for the common good of both sides. With my best respects to your honourable sons. My respected father and my sons Saud and Faisal and their brothers offer their best wishes and respects, This is what had to be said to your Higlmess and may you be preserved.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter dated 10th Dhil-Qaadah 1338 (27th July 1920) contents of which I have fully noted espe cially regarding the question of the French and the Sharif and the nationalists. God be praised for this, but my only regret is that my friends the High British Government have not occupied Syria. As regards the Sharif Faisal I felt certain that he would commit .such an action, for two reasons the first being that he is drunk with success and the second that he is ignorant and dishonest. Undoubtedly what has happened is due to the good luck of the Allies, and God has ruined his affairs before he could succeed in his plans or arrange that any of our enemies join him, namely any of the hostile powers. I hope, the Allied Powers will henceforward pay full attention towards the Arab afiairs which may afford ease to all. I hope your honour will in-sha-Allah communicate to me all necessary news. Regarding your party : Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hasan and Shaikh Farhan and my' cousin, Ahmad Al-Thaniyan, left as I informed your honour, and I told them of all news that I received while they were here, and surely they must have informed you in detail.

No. B/103 Dated 5th October 1920. Assumption 'by Ibn Saud of royal status. He broached the subject himself in general terms, claiming that he was de facto paramount Arab chief in Central Arabia and that whether from point of view of noble birth or extent of his sphere he was certainly no less worthy of royal status than Sherif, whose primary status was that of official nominee t.o a Turkish Govt, post, whom for the pur poses of their war policy the allies had recognised as King. I took the line indicated in your telegram of Sth Sept. and had little difficulty in riding him off idea of assuming title of King. He suggested that 'Sultan of Central Arabia woild be appropri ate - but I expressed the view that it was too vague and comprehensive especially with an Ibn Rashid in the field, and recoinnended Sultan of 'Hejd and its dependencies'. He will accept our advice on this point. A g to the most appropriate method of bringing about the change he pointed out that he obviously could not run the risk of aakingany public announcement of his assumption of the title unless he were assured before he did so that we would accept it and he asked me to ascertain the views and if possible obtain the assurance of H.s Govt, I therefore request your authority either to address him officially saying that with reference to his verbal communication to me H.M.Govt, are pleased to comment that they will offer no objection to his assuming the said title should he decided to do so; or altemat: /-ively, that I should inform him semi-off icially that should such an intimation be received from him H.M^Govt. will reply in the sense desired.

Ibn Saud asserted that he had no aggressive or ambitious either against the Sherif or Syria or Mesopotamia, As regards the Sherif it was clear from the reports received from his deputation that the preliminaries of a settlement had been affected and that the Sherif was now desirous of making peace. He, Ibn Saud, was also ready in principle and the more so because H.M's Govt, desired it but he thought it necessary to utter the caveat that he doubted whether peace be^.veen them would really be in the interests of His Majesty's Govt # and asked to explain he replied that the Sherif was talking now-a-days undisguisedly against Great Britain whom he accused of having let him down and failed to fulfil their solumn undertakings to him and his sons. That being the case the assumption was that Sherif's present desire to bury the hatchet was pro'mpted by the hope of getting Ibn Saud to combine with him in pursuit of an anti-British policy. In view of this possibility he thought it essential that H.M.Govt. should be a party to any treaty concluded between them as is warranted by the terms of our own X xkb. treaty with Sluncfct Ibn Saud for were the latter to enter into any independent treaty with Sherif it would be difficult for him to keep us fully informed of its working without being accused by Sherif of betraying ✓ his confidence. I n conclusion he said that on return of his deputation he would immediately inform me of nature of Sherif'a proposals secret or otherwise and obtain the advice of H.M's Govt, before replying. Referring to the occupation of Ebha he gave the impression and I think sincerely that he did not attach much import-importance to it. At all eirents he desired that it was part of any preconceived or far-reaching scheme. The Idrisi with whom he had long had very friendly relations had complained to him bitterly of the 'behaviour of Ibn Aith and asked his assistance and he thought it incumbent on him to respond.

Since Parhan's return I have had atill further reaaon to be pleaaed with hia work. 3yed Siddiq Haaaan 4 \ haa b^en full of hia pi^aiaea both in repiirrl to hia tact hia un-failing cheerfulnesa, and ability to inrratiate himaelf with all he haa come into contact with. I can myself vouch for the 'Giyaai* of Farhan, which ia of a high order. He haa certainly found hia 'metier' as ner- sonal advisor and 'go-between* to myself. I can only hope now, you will use your good offices in gettinn: him the coveted hoyfnour of Khan Sahib. For the future, T recommend Farhan Al Rahmah for such job as he hol^s now A i.e. personal Assistant to^rf Political Officer? especial ly will he be found useful in dealing with the Arabs of Nejd and Bedouin tribes generally. He is no good a f . office work. Both Bin Saud and Shaikh Isa have taken a strong liking to Farhan and both at different times have v» n ^congratulated me on keeping close to me aa -nersonal advisor, a man with the family standing of Farhan. Farhan has now been with me in Bahrein since I ar rived, namely a year ago. He draws no pay except what I have been able to give him out of my private purse and from Jecret Service Funds.

I myself continued to re-nly ' Ye^s, yes' to hia talk in order that he might continue what he waa aayinr, and I found out what waa in hia heart.

The High Gtoveunnent has bean nleaaecl to prant the Egyptians the entire control of their own internal affairs. The Sudan and Palestine which lie to the South and East of Egypt remain under Bristih control. The Suez canal zone renains in the hand of the High Government and a large force of troons will be quartered at Kantara and at Tel El Kabir. Troons actually in Egypt will be withdrawn to these places. Of dourse, the British High Uommiasioner, Lord allenby, will remain in ^gypt to advise the Sultan and generally auperviae mattera« A Britiah Officer will alao remain in charge tn of Public Debt Department. All other Britiah officers will be withdrawn from public services unless the Egyptian Government express a desire to retain them. The general meaning of the reforms is that the High Government remains the protecting power, but allows the Egyptians tofentire ly manage their internal affairs without interference.

Dobbs , C.S .I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward herewith, in case they may be of interest to the Government of India, a copy of a report describing his journey to Riyadh and Mecca with the Nejd Mission to King Hussain by Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan, together with a report on the same subject by Shaikh Earhan Beg A1 Rahmah, Muntafiq, who accompanied the Khan Sahib, Both reports are, I think, interesting, describing the journey through little known country, and the happenings en route, from different points of view. I consider that Khan Sahib Saiyid Siddiq Hassan did very good work on this Mission, but no doubt His Excellency the High Commissioner, to whom copies of these reports, together with certain recommendations, were sent direct by the Political Agent, will take steps to obtain recognition of Saiyid Siddiq Hassan's services, should he think fit. DIARY OE JOURNEY EROM BAHREIN TO MECCA. 1. Left Bahrein, Thursday the 15th July, 1920 = 28th Shawwal 1338 at 10 a m . The Political Agent, Major H. R. P. Dickson, C.LE., very kindly gave his steam launch, 44 The Bahrein', and his own personal friend and Assist- tant, Shaikh Earhan A1 Rahmah of the Muntafiq, Iraq, to assist me. Major Dickson, with his staff and several others, came to see us off on board and gave me a good * send-off 2. Owing to Shimal we had to anchor off Aqariyah near Zallaq, where we reached at 3-30 p.m . Sailed asrain at 2-00 p m . when Shimal went down, arriving 'O^air at 6-30 a.m . Wasted two hours in trying to get into the inner harbour, going as near the wooden pole (mark) as seemed safe ; but the launch was nearly aground (north-west of pole) and had to go back and anchor quarter mile away to the north of the pole. So the Mafras or the sandy bed N.-N.-B. approach to harbour is not at all navigable even for the little '* Bahrein ' draw ing only six feet water. Dredger is a necessity for the improvement of 'Ojair, the • inner harbour being safe and deep and broad; the only difficulty is the Mafras, 4 or 5 miles out. 3. Bin Khair Allah, the Amir, sent me two big lighters and we landed at 11 a.m ., Friday, the 16th July 1920-29th Shawwal. 4. 'Ojair, the port of Hassa, is hardly worth the name of port. There is only an old Turkish Khan and a few huts. The Amir, a slave of Bin Saud's, is a good-natured, middle-aged man. Stops in the south part of the Khan, of which the opposite end is used as customs office by the farmer Bin Earis (Mahdi), a Bahreini, brother of Haji Aii Bin Earis of Qatif. There are a dozen shops outside, fronting the sea. A kachcha wharf is going to be built, and Mr. Nizam-ud-Din, Overseer, Fublic Works Department, has come with me to take necessary notes of survey to make an estimate for Qusaibi by Bin Saud's orders. The Khan is large enough to accommodate something like 500 men or more, built in the style of our Sarais in India with, of course, small towers for defence. Lots of cargo was lying on the wharf, almost the whole of it coming in dho-vs from or via Bahrein. Tables will soon be turned, it seems probable, when 'Ojair is opened to ships and steamers begin to call. Eound five nicely caparisoned dromedaries sent by Bin Jiluvi, Amir of Hassa, waiting for us with two well-armed Badus for escort. These with two camels and two donkeys for load and servants, formed our little caravan, which left 'Ojair at 5 p.m ., after taking an Asha with the Amir at the Customs place. Ser vants and luggage gone ahead two hours ago. 5. I ride a dromedary to-day after something like fifteen years. 1131 F&amp;PD2 6. Halted for prayers at arriving 7-30 p.m ., ten miles west of/ 'Ojair. ^ Said Maghrib and Asha prayers, took coffee and started again afc 8-30 p.m . All in goodspirits. 7. The route is over sandy ground, rather little hills of sand/dunes,' without any path or track, still Muhammad Al As wad knows his way—does not own that he is guided by stars. A few ' Fasil' wild date palm, our Indian Ak, and one or two kinds of shrubs here and there form the only green. Our camels avail themselves of a snatched morsel of these shrubs every now and then. 8. Muwaih was reached at 12-30 after midnight, after a good five hours' run, covering at least 20 miles of deep sand, the patient quiet camels moving up and down the dunes. We felt tired and Farban, remembering Major Dickson's ' Not to cook me too fast,ordered a halt. We slept on the cool sands till 3-^0 a.m ., when Muhammad Al As wad awoke us with a peremptory, even harsh 'Goomoo Salloo Fine star-lit night, cool and calm. No moon, no sound except the little wail of the camel which must needs be tired, having come down over night from Hofuf (over fifty miles) and now doing the return journey afer a few hours' rest. Our kit and servants are still behind though they started from Muwaih with us. Starting at 1 a.m. 9. Sabakhah was passed at sunrise. It is a watering place or where temporary little pools are dug, as at Muwaih, and sweet water comes out in a •ufficient quantity. Small level plainer wadi with a patch of green surrounded by sand hills or dunes (Taus {J* plural of Taas as these are called by Arabs). We passed on at some distance of it, leaving it at about 400 yards to our left (east). The route, seen now, lay over a level plain of whitish (salt) ground, a narrow valley among sand dunes, for about two miles. Saw several little heaps of camel bones, skeletons lying in this valley. These were ' the poor beasts that were ' Inqataa' (= cut off—very expressive word indeed characteristic of the Arabic language) from the train by sheer fatigue and heavy load. This is about middle of the distance between 'Ojair and Hofnf ; the wretched animal must have found himself unable, after a halt, to go on any farther, and been beaten to death by the cruel Rai in an attempt to make him go on. We had to exchange two of our camels which had been giving trouble, sitting down every now and then and refusing to go on (Muhammad- al-Aswad's and Farhan's). Former picked out two out of a lot going down unladen to bring cargo from 'Ojair ; as result we went on at a better pace.' • 10. Oebdeh, I was told, was some miles off to our left (east). It was at this place that the whole of the Turkish Askar (garrison) was surprised and butchered to a man by the Manasir Badoos. 11. Jishtbeh, a big village with a * Soor' wall, was first seen from the last and highest sand-hills (Taus) at 8 a .m ., Jebel Garrah (G=Q= =well-fixed) and Jebel Burais^ah (lit. little bright thing) also seen at a distance of 19 milei or so to the N.-N -W. Former is higher and longer of a dull sandy colour, while the latter, as its name suggests, is small and of a whitish colour. The village is inhabited by the Hassa Arabs and seems to contain seme 300 housen with population of 1,200 to 1,600 souls. Fine little mud-houses, nearly all one story. We passed on to Jafnr, arriving at 9 a.m . From Jishsheh, it may be said, Wadi Hassa begins with a long stretch of date palms, fine gardens and green fields. Barley freshly harvested. Inhabitants are all Falaliiu Plenty of water from springs. 12. J afar, a smaller village than Jishsheh of same type. We could not go on although Hofuf is only two hours' distance. It is now 9 a.m ., but the sun is so (strong and wind Gharbi) so hot that it is (in addition to the fatigue) most discomforting, if not risky, to continue the march to Hofuf. We have Already been moving pretty fast for about 13 hours and must have, I think, covered at least 50 miles. Halted for ' Maqil' (mid-day rest) at one Farhan Al Ajail's, who gave us a good lunch'. Abdullah bin Hasan Al Qusaibi joined us here. He comes to receive us. Had fine grapes, figs, water-mellons and fresh dates, exceptionally good and very cool, ' Laban ' (whey) almost icy- cool owing to Oharbi, hot wind. Took coffee at Amir's and started at 4 p^ m . Baited for Asar prayers.13. Fadhul, a petty little hamlet, where Ibrahim A1 Qusaibi and several Others were waiting to receive us, prayed, took dates and coffee and resumed journey at 5 P.M. Date pilms on all sides. Four little hillocks, looking something like petty pyramids or towers in a line, appear 2 or 3 miles to the south. These are called Arbaah (the four). From Jishsheh onwards the road is a good lerel one on hard ground (at times stony), even a motor or gari could go provided the small ' Jasur'* or bridges over the little canals irrigating.the palms around were broadened a little. Part of tiie way runs between good date palms which are very well tended. We passed by three small fortresses, at short distancess, on the road between Fadhul and Hofuf. These were built by the Turks to protect the road and to serve as an outer defence for Hofuf itself against the incessant attacks of the Arabs. The Qusaibis tell me that since the occupation of Hassa by Bin Saud, these have never been manned, as no danger of disturbance was feared after the oxodus of the Turk (in 1911-12). 14 Jlofuf, commonly called Hassa, was reached at 5-45 p.m ., on Saturday the 17th July 1920 = 30th Shawwal, 1338, 24i hours after leaving 'Ojair. Fairly big walled town of good appearance, with a fort inside, west part. There is also a big mosque in the fort, known as Jamait Ibrahim Fasha, built years ago. Mr. Philby's photographs of this and other places of interest have been published. Good buildinu: in itself, with only one very big dome in the middle, but in comparison to our Indian .lamias of the Fathan Kings and Mughal Emperors this is of no consequence at all. The town has only two gates. We entered by the east gate, where there was a big crowd of Askaris and common people. Found servants standing near by in front of a house. It is our quarter : the former Turkish Eushdior primary school. We passed along the bazaar, about two hundred yards to the Amir's house, where we were received by him. Here we have the great Bin Jiluvi (Abdullah Bin Jiluvi) who, of course, has airs, talks with an amount of reserve and in a patronising tone. Has received us fairly well on the whole, and somehow makes me feel that I, at least, am welcome to him, although he first took the coffee without the usual courtesy of offering it first to the guest. He has reason to be prqud and conceited as he has, an uncouth Badu that he is, achieved what his big predecessors, the Turkish Walis, with high-flown titles, etc., failed to achieve— peace and tranquillity. He is feared and respected by high and low, far and near, for his even handed justice, as the punishments which Bin Jiluvi awards are the severest possible, beyond even the strict ' Shara hand ' He always cuts a man's right hand for theft as soon as it is admitted or proved before him. He beheads the murderer without fail. The last was on Thursday last, the day fixed for ' Hudud ' punishments, 15th July, when an Arab (Akhwan) was decapitated with sword for having recently killed a Shiah Syed, whom the bigot suspected of having smoked before coming out to meet his demand to sell some goods. The story goes that the Akhwan went to buy provisions in a village ; the Shiah Syed offered to supply the wants, and asked the Arab to sit down in the shop, and went Inside for somethins: returning after a few minutes. The Akhwan said that he smelt of tobacco, and that the man must have gone in to smoke. ' You chafir, you smoke titin, you must be butchered '; with these words the poor wretch was stabbed to death with Khanjar. 16. We sat for about quarter of an hour, as it was first meeting. Bin Jiluvi talked of common things, asked after Major Dickson, Shaikh Isa, Yusuf Kanoo, etc., etc. He did not show interest in the talk about Hajj, which Farhan started; shewed ignorance of the Imam's wishes or intentions in the matter. Came to our quarter (the former school) and found servants and kit alright. Two attendants added by the Amir, Muhammad Effendi, with his son-in-law Abdullah came to see us at 6-30 p.m . Both are interesting relics of Turkish times in Hassa. Former is treasurer as before, and latter comparatively a late arrival, young man, is a doctor. Has recently been to Bin Saud at Riyadh, and is now on leave to see his family here. Night was cool and nice after a hot day. Saw the new moon on Saturday, the 16th July, just after the Maghrib prayers. This is now Dhil Qaadah. 16. Sunday, 18th July — 1st Dhil Qaadah. —The Amir, Bin Jiluvi, invited us to coffee at 7 a.m . Had a good long chat. Complains of the Basrah Times having been allowed by the Government to write things in derogation to the Imam. The recent thing published was that Bin Eashid had severely defeated&gt;4 9 k. IIPMCTL and annihilated Bin Saud's force near Shuaibah—this was the reverse of truth, etc. Shaikh Salim of Kuweit was doing mischief and shall suffer sooner than later ; he took hold of distant tribesmen and bribed them, and then presented them to the Political'A^ent, Kuweit, as Bin Rashid's men sent to him, Salim, on a friendly errand. Political Agent, Kuweit, had better be warned by Government not to listen to him, etc. 17. Bin Jiluvi's silence and the doubts expressed by the Qusaibis, Muhammad A1 Hawwas, Sulaiman A1 Pahad A1 Bassam, and others in conversa tion with me, make me a little dubious about the chief or sole object of my mission—theHajj: no signs of the Imam's intended Hajj: none knows, not even the best-informed circles; none of the middle or higher classes can go having had no notice; only Bedouin Akhwan fire-brands may swell the ranks. 30,000 will be least number, they say, and they will go armed to a man. Once started, they will Hajj or ( ie, etc., etc. If Bin Saud had not given notice, not less than 50,000 Nejdis would have gone to the Hajj. I only thank God, and admire Bin baud's w T isdom in keeping it so secret. 18. Monday, 19th July = 2nd Bhil Qaadah. —Visited Shaikh Abu Bakr, •n old Alim and pious man of Iraq origin, whose father settled in Hassa. The Wahhabis destroyed his father's grave, at the instance of Bin Saud some say, sis he was revered as a ' Wali' or saint. 19. Also visited Muhammad Effendi, Qusaibis Hawwas, Bassam and Dhukair, all of whom received us very well and entertained us with fruit and coffee. Nice respectable people, full of praises for their Imam. I noticed again that Bin Jiluvi is not only feared but also respected for his just though harsh administration of this district, which was so notorious for murder or rapine during the time of Turks, only seven years ago. 20. Our departure to-day is postponed again, it is said, to await arrival of good mounts; camels sent for from pome distance. 21. Tuesday, 20th July = 3rd Dhil Qaadah, —Wrote letters to Bahrein. Received several visitors, chief being Harbi bin Aqil, Shaikh of Bani Khalid, and Tami bin Khalid, Shaikh ot Bani Hajar. IS o signs of our onward move. Saw Bin Jiluvi and pointed out the delay. He promised to despatch us to-morrow without fail. Reason of delay does not appear except that special dromedaries requisitioned from distant place are still to come. Those present are not good enough. 22. Hasan and Abdullah Qusaibi called and minor requirements for th« journey arranged for. 23 TFednesday, the 2lst July = 4th Dhil Qaadah. —Bin Jiluvi sent me ten camels, two special for myself and Parhan, three for servants, and five for escort and kit. They were sent with kit to wait for us at the wells, four miles out on the route to Riyadh. Parhan and myself, with three Pidawis, started, at 4 p.m. on horseback. Pound all ready at the wells. One, Pahad bin Jabir of Riyadh, with Muhammad Sulaiman ana Rashid of Buraida and two servants are also going with us. So our caravan of 15 camels and one mare (given as present ' Bubharah ' to Ibn Jabir, who brought good news for Bin Jiluvi of the victory over the Shammar) started off for Riyadh at 6 p.m . Prom the town of Hofuf to this point, wells, there are big sand dunes. The Pidawis returned after I gave them the customary 'Ikram', the others, namely Bin Jiluvi's men and three attendants having been paid in the morning. We carry 14 skins of water, non-available on route till after four days' march or within two days of Riyadh. Escort 'Abdullah Bin 'Adwah of the A]man, (2) his son Mutlaq, (3) Hadhdhal Hajiri, (4) Duhaim Hajiri, (6) Rajih Hajiri. Ground near Hofuf, four miles or so, sandy, then hard, level, stcny valley, with hills on both sides of the route. Passed a hill called ' IJthmaniyah' at 9-30 p.m . and Ghar,' a big den in the rocks, at 11-30 p.m ., and halted for rest at Na'alah, a sandy wadi or plain at 1-00 a.m ., re-starting at 4 a.m . Cool, calm night. Ibn Adwah shouted ' Goomoo Salloo,' got up, prayed and rode off. HOPUF TO NA'ALAH-S HOURS. 24. Thursday, 22nd July = 5th Bhil Qaadah. —Left Na'alah at 4 a.m. The route lies over sandy ground; went down into a deep (200 feet) wadi, Al-Ghawar, deep sands, good deal of pasture— u Ashab ' Arfaj ' and ' Hanzal' like small melons; this is the well-known medicine for boils,wouacl, etc., and proverbial for bitterness Here Tuwain of the Ajman overtook us with a tent sent by Bin Jiluvi, as Farhan had returned the one &amp;iven us from Hofuf when starting from the wells. Very kind of Bin Jiluvi. At 10 a.m . halted at Shaibah, a sandy valley with some pasture. Man and beast wanted food and rest. Took lunch and slept in the tent—poor protection against the mighty sun. Shimal is blowing, so it is tolerable. Still very hot, dusty and uncomfortable. Our camels, some ' Maaqultramelled, others not, grazed in the valley. I slept a little from sheer exhaustion, otherwise too hot to sleep. » Terrible glare of the sun. Have adopted Ghatra and Aqal, which helps to cover the face and neck, and Aba protects from hot wind. Farhan is very jolly and cuts jokes with the Badu escort. 25. Started at 4-30 p.m . and passed through Wadi Shajarab, a small narrow Shaab, river-bed, with some shrubs and one tree, Sumr (Indian Kikar), small stunted. 26. Halted for prayers and dinner at 7-30; re-started at 8-30. Route now lies over hard, stony, level ground, with small black and white pebbles. No pasture. Halted at 2-30 a.m . A good night march which taxed me. Slept at Bizah. No population at all so far. NA'ALAH to BIZAH,—15 HOURS. 27. Friday, the 23rd July = 6th Dhil Qaadah. —Left Bizah at 6 a.m. ~We are still travelling due west from Hofuf. Passed over a little plain, called Rauzah. it is a misnomer, as the two dozen groups of small stunted Sumr (Ifcdian Klkar) cannot be called garden. Good shrubs and pasture. Met a small caravan of four men and ten camels going down to Hofuf. Ground hard and stony. , Passed through Wadi Malsuniyah at 9 a.m . arid then a high ground, sandy with half buried stones in circles. This is, Bin Adwah says, the ruined town of Bin Yazdar of the Bani Hilal—how old he cannot tell. I notice what may have been the Soor, or town wall, a big circle of stones, and many small circles and lines of stones: these might have been houses. Tne town was deserted, I am told, for want of water—drought. No water or population so far anywhere. Ground sandy again. 28. Halted for rest and lunch at 30 a.m . at Jasrah, a little sandy plain with hills in the distance,, Good pasture for camels. Slept better than ,yesterday. Still a strong Shimal is blowing. Re-started at 4 p.m ., passed a high water-shed or plateau of Jasrah, hisrh ground in the middle and low, sandy below on sides with bright reddish sands. Halted at Rijm for prayers and dinner at 7 p m and re-started at 9 p.m ., travelling over sandy ground, and after a while entered into Dahanah, a big deep sandy wadi, in which we travelled very slowly. No path or track, yet Bin Abdullah knows his business and leads up and down big sand hills. Halted at 2 p.m . in Dahanah. Very cool night. Slept three hours. BIZAH TO DAHANAH—13 HOURS. 29. Saturday, 24th July — 7th Dhil Qaadah. —Started at 5 a.m. from Pahanah. This wadi, a very sandy one, contains biggest and most curiously shaped sand dunes around as far as eye can see. At 6-30 a m. met a caravan of Hadhar Duwasir going to Hassa. Pass over a bit of hard ground which extends north of route some 3 or 4 miles, overgrown with good shrubs, ' Ashab' and heather. See several tracks of deer and wolf. This bit is called the Gari Abu Jafan, or land on which Abu Jafan hill empties itself; the surplus rain water is evidently swallowed up by the huge sands of Dahanah. Manif Bai Sufairah ' (of the yellowish she-camel) says he saw two gazelle at a distance which soon disappeared over a sand dune—hill. 30. Halted at 9 a.m . on a clean Jbit of raised ground, still ' Gari'. Saw a big flock of sheep grazing close by, first sign of lUe or habitation since we left Hofuf. Sent to buy a sheep, but the shepherd refused to sell saying he was a servant and had no authority to sell. ol. Fahad bin Jabir gave me ^Aqqah' (dried whey) which mixed with the ice cold water from our water skins is a boon. Took a long deep drink of it, most welcome and enjoyable in such a heat and journey in desert. Every one pleased at the prospect of reaching water 'Al-ma' at Abu Jafan. Bin Adwah over-ruled Farhan and gave one Dallah full of water to each of our 1131 f&amp;pd nfive riding camels, hy the nose, and they looked a bit refreshed» Hadhdhul is said to have stolen half a skin last night,, when all were asleep, and given his camel. Farhan is furious. Lunched and slept and started again for Abu Jafan at 5 p.m . Ground is hard, stony, low, with hills around, dark brown rocks. Good pasture in the valley ; ascending to Abu Jafan; reached at 6-30 p.m. DAHANAH TO ABU JAFAN—6 HOURS. 32. Sunday, 25th July = 8th Dhil Qaadah. —Abu Jafan isagray bill with a narrow valley running between rocks. There are two wells at the entrance. Water is found here, after three days' and nights' marching. Low rocks of good gray and whitish stone. Water is sweet. We got a good sheep here for $5 = RIO and enjoyed our dinner and slept the whole night, after passing three successive nights with hardly three hours' sleep each night. There are three little camps of Duwasir Bedouin in their ' Buyut Shaar*'. There are the ' Mutadayinah *' or Akhwan, who regard every people Kafir, will not salaam or return any one's salaam unless it was an Akh, one of their own class. Farhan and myself prayed with them ai Maghrib : they looked at us askance, not at all pleased at our joining their Jamaat prayer. At a little distance I saw three Bedu women praying, a sure sign, to my mind, of the religion being deep-seated in these callous Bedouin hearts. They are weak, dirty, unhealthy looking people on the whole. Some hundreds of sheep and goats and about 400 camels. Evening and morning saw wonren going round milking camels. Also collecting camels* urine with which they wash their hair—dirty habit. It was a very amusing sight when the camels were given water, drawn in leather buckets from a depth of about 40 feet in big wooden ' Haudh ' open casks, the men drawing water uttering a curious cry ' Chokh,' ' Chokh ', to encourage them to drink, as if any encouragement was needed. Not a single man came to us. The Shaikh is said to be one Ibn Dhuwaiyan in Kharaj. How different these are from their kinsmen, our friends the Dosaris in Badiah, Bahrein. Started at 5 a m ., going up-hill three miles northward. Two flocks of sheep seen with Rai, riding a donkey ahead. One route going to south, to Khar] and Yamamah. Pass Wadi Al-Lalal with three others of this name, collectively called Al-Hillah, all flowing into Dahanah. In Rabi'a, during rains, this route is avoided and the Makhyut route to the south or 'Juda route is travelled by, both of which are said to be more sandy and stiffer than this Bin Adwah, our chief escort, here shows me the Manakh camping ground of Mr. Philby, whom too he escorted to Riyadh and Kharaj in 1918. He escorted Dr. Harrison last winter and remembers with surprise that the •' Brekani' (American) walked long distances ahead of the camels bare-headed although strong &lt;jold Shimal was blowing. At 8 a.m . we come up on high rocks with big deep ravines below, about 300 feet down. We dismount and descend slowly, the way being by no means easy or safe. Many a poor camel has, I am told, fallen down here to rise nO more. Rugged rocks, all round, the highest seen far. The most prominent is called Khashm-Al-Ausah. The hills running south to north are called Al-Urumah, with a big plain opening out to west, and a ring of black, jet black, rocks to west and north. These are called Dughma. Far away to the south-west are the big hills of Jabha, behind which lies the town of Kharaj and other villages of Duwasir Arabs. Halted at 10 a.m . in a sandy wadi with a good pasture surrounded by Dhughm rocks. Tried but could not write diary—hot, dry, dusty day. Lunched and slept. Re-started at 4 p.m . Passed several little wadis river beds called Tarabi. A big black rock seen at a distance to north called Rahaiyrtt-As Sauda, another, further still, called Rahaiyat-Al-Hamra. Halted for prayers and dinner at 6-30 p.m ., re-started at 8 p.m ., reached Uqlat Hamaid at 1 a.m. ABU JAFAN TO UQLAT HAMAID-13 HOURS. 33. Monday, 26tb July = 9th Dhil Qaadah. —Started at 5 a.m . from Uqlat Hamaid, a small plain at the close of hills. Hard ground. Four wells w ith fairly good water at a depth of only 20 feet or so. About a score of Badu huts or Bayat Shaar with sheep and camel ; these are Kharfan section of the Duwasir. Poor, dirty sickly men and women. Farhan acted as ' Gari ' on ' Qari ' on a girl of 6 whom her old father brought to us. She suffers from fever. I gave her quinine pills. A young w oman came up asking for medicine for ' Garah,' boils on the neck, which she unveiled and showed without hesi tation. I gave her Oriental Balm. Several others came up asking formedicines, etc , but we started off, the sun rising. Bin Jabir sent a man ahead with letter to Riyadh saying we would reach to-morrow morning. At 7-30 a.m. passed Shua'ibah Haniyan, a dry river-bed running around at the foot of the high rocky plateau, bx)wl-shaped. At 10 a.m . halted at Wadi Abun Nas, a sandy valley among rocks, with good grazing for camels. After lunch and rest started at 4-30 p.m ., marching over hard rock groun'i with rocks all round at a distance. At 6 p.m , descended into a low wadi or plain where there ia a good pasture of ' Ashab ' and ' Afraj,' etc., some Sumr (Indian Kikar) trees. ^ We now enter Jubail rocks, low muddy hills of dark brown colour extending south to north. La^t rock protruding to the west is called Khashm-Al-Aun from where the route descendsinto the Wadi As-Salai. Halted at 6-30 p m ., Prayed, took dinner and re-started at 8-30 p.m ., marching up to li -30 p.m . Halted on a level rock of Mughaiizat hills. Riyadh is 'only an hour from here. Slept well, very cool night. This was where Abdul Aziz hid with 40 picked camel riders and dashed at Riyadh at midnight, re-captur ing it from Ibn Rashid, 16 years ago, so Bin Jabir tells me. # TJQLAT-HAMAID TO SALAI—10 HOURS. 34. Tuesday, 27th July = 10th Dhil Qaacto/*.—Starting at 5-30 a.m ., we soon came up on the hills called Mugharizat (milked dry). These are really milked dry by the Riyadh valley below on to which all the water of rainfall must flow from these rocks Prom the last of these and the highest you see Riyadh, lying like a princess on a green bed. It is a very pleasing sisrht after a hard journey of five days and nights running. Some people do it in ten days and a special post runner in three only, but often kills his camel. 36. We arrived in Riyadh at 7 a.m . : thus actual time occupied in travel ling (moving) is 65 hours. 36. As soon as we dismounted in front of the 'Qasr palace of the ruler, a secretary whom I later knew to be Ibrahim Bin Jummah Shammari, received us at the gate and took us up and ushered into the ' Maktab,' office of the Imam. - 37. The Imam 1 Bin Saud (Shaikh Sir 'Abdul ' Aziz, K.O.I.E.) received us very kindly and courteously rising and meeting us in the centre of his office. Tall, well-built, fair, good-featured man of about 40. Talks with ease, rather fast. Welcomed our visit which he said is a bit delayed, and repeatedly said that answer to his letter was much delayed by Government. After 15 minutes' ordinary talk, we were sent with Ahmad Thanaiyan to the other, west, side of the Qasr, the quarters set apart for us. Good, commodious, well- furnished house with all requirements. Two attendants and one coffee-man given to us and we settled down comfortably. It is rather hot, but not unplea sant, oppressive like Bahrein. It is dry heat. The wind is Shimal. 38. Ibrahin Bin Jumaah Shammari, secretary, and Bin Shalhub, treasurer, and Ibn Suwaidan, clerk, came to visit us. After Maghrib the Imam called ui to his private Majlis and talked a lot. 39. Wednesday, 28th July = 11th Dhil Qaadah. —Went out for a ride to the Imam's garden, north of the town, called the Shamsiyah. Good garden with excellent date trees and in one part peaches, pomegranates and other fruit trees but no vines. 40. At 9 a.m . wrote letters to Bahrein, informing Political Agent of our arrival here, Bin Sand's remarks regarding going to Hajj that he cannot possibly go if Government, to whom he has made fresh reference while we were on the road to Riyadh, insist on his taking a small number of men and limited number of armed following ; but that he will send a son op other representation with a small body of pilgrims and conciliatory letters for the Sherif, that, too, because Government desire it. 41. Bin Saud to-day talked a lot of the Jariyah incident and Shaikh Salim's hostility to him from beginning to date Even his Vakil and cousin Nasir As-Saud, who took a friendly letter, was insulted. Salim only sought war. Bin Saud seems to be much worried over his rupture with Shaikh Salini and Bin Rashid. He, too, mentions the Basrah Times writing the wrong report that Bin Saud was defeated and 13 out of 3,300 of his men escaped from field. As a matter of fact, he (his son Bu Sharrain) defeated Bin Rashidbadly, killing many hundreds and capturing some hundreds of camels and other booty. He also says that he is ignored and belittled by Government, wlio do not know his real positron, etc. Talks too much indeed and very fast, 'without stopping to breathe, it seems. 42 J he body still aches, but I can enjoy food and drink better than on the road live days. Good Arab fashion pulao and shorba : very cold water, icy cold. Attendants very attentive and well-behaved. 43. Riyadh Thursday, 29th July 12th = Dhil Qaadah.—WioiQ letters to .Bahrein, especially one to Tolitical Agent, covering all I could remember of a Teiy long lecture of the Imam Bin Sand, about his relations with the Sherif, am latter s continuous acts of hostility and aggression in spite of his own oft-expressed good intention ; also about his, Bin Sand's, financial condition large and mcreasmg expenditure and 'debts incurred : owes 1190,000 'to ? :? 00 to Al1 Bm Cus toms Mudir, Qatif, took fresh loan of itoOjOOO for the present expedition to Assir. In Assir, I gather 10,000 men under Musaidare still fighting. His son, Saud plead 15,000 men against Ibn Bashid the other day, while Faisal Al Dawish attacked Qaraiyah at the ea o 7, 0 Akl ^an. All this must entail a very heavy expenditure m spite ot usual- Arab economy. In course of conversation'Bin Saud said tnat . nlim, Khazaal and Talib were his enemies in spite of his havicff been a good friend to each of them formerly. Salim was of a suspecting na ure and^ possessed little or no sense. Khazaal was always iealous of urn and insincere to ah ; while Talib was a double-faced old intriguer whose return to Iraq would only create trouble for Government etc., etc. i • on! noon Shalhub, the Imam's treasurer, and then Ahmad bin lhanaryan visit us and offer any assistance, etc., to make us quite comtcriable. As a matter of fact we are quite so and are only anxious to iret orders to proceed to Mecca as early as possible. Former talks of the great inqessant caHs of the Imam on the treasury and Tosha-Khana, his ever-growin- i' ' 1 . etc., latter about the Mutadaiyanah ^Akhwan), who are an ever-increasing compact body and a great force which the Imam has always at Lis command : two lakhs of these could be mobilized at any moment. 'l wonder if any part of Arabia could possibly maintain so large an army, were it ever raised and marched, as food, water and fodder are so much lacked in this part of the world. v cool ^nd pleasant^ ^ther hot, especially out-of-doors. Nights are ♦rs t ^fday. oOlh July = 7.3th I)hil Qaadah. —Early morning walked out mam A )dur Rahman s garden. It is one of the best vineyards in Riyadh and contains various fruit-trees—pears, peaches, apricots—pomegranates and guavas ; also water-melons A dark, elderly man of half-negro appearance accompamcd us. He is said to be the Imam's half-brother and agent. He treated us with exce.lent fresh grapes and water-melons, which seemed to better than ordinary, as we ate these sitting on the little &lt;t haudll ,, (water reservoir) in the garden with water drawn from a big well bv donkeys, runnine out into tne vineyard all around. It is very nice and cool here.' Went for Jumaah prayer in the Jamia mosque about 300 yards from the palace. All on i'huTff 8 ^ lD ^ mosque smn to stare us with suspicion and dislike, i ,»&gt;{ cou.se, ti e 1 ions U ahhabi does not even deign to look, but turns his tace as we approach near him, and this in spite of the full Arab dress we rathtT I, have adopted. But why forget that we are ' Aianib ' outsiders! non-lsejdis, and as such we are only fit to be suspected and hated, even though w e go to the'r mosque and join thc-ir prayer. Shaikh Abdullah Bin Abdul Latil read th« Khutbah and lead «ie prayers. This old gentleman is the ighest religious authority in Nejd, and has the reputation of profound learning and great piety He is practically the Shaikh-ul-Iskm of Neid (though ho is not so styled) and controls all the Ulama or learned men and Qazis. w horn lie appoints to the mofussil towns and villages. Bin Saud often speaks 01 him with great reverence, and consults him in important state attdirs, always showing mm a respect equal to that he has for his old father in,am , h(.ur lishman. these being the only two persons whose advice is sought and followed by this illustrious ruler. Nothing particularly to note about the JUiutbah 'sermon) or tlie prayer, both being of the old orthodox Sunni type that we arc accustomed to in India, with the necessary W ahhabi omission' ofthe closing prayer for Sultan of Turkey, who is usually styled Amir-ul- Mouniiin ' Commander-of-the-faithful 47. On returning to the palace after prayers, I called on Faisal Bin Abdul Aziz and introduced Farhan to him. Faisal has been married recently and is proud that his marriage has been noticed in English newspapers. He remem bers his visit to England with lively pleasure and great satisfaction : says he would like to learn English, but could not find a teacher in Riyadh. Farhan suggested Mr. Muhammad Raushan Akhtar (proposed secretary of the Baladiyah, Bahrein) as a very suitable person. Farhan subsequently told me that he had also made this suggestion in a private conversation with Bin Saud. 48. In the afternoon we called on Bin Saud who showed me two news letters he had received from his secret informers in Madinah and Buraidah : these would show that the Sherif had latterly sent an envoy in the person of one Saleh A1 Daghistani to Ibn Rashid whom the Sherif is credited to have supplied with 7^ camel-load of guns (artillery) ammunition, 6,000 cases of arms and ammunition and 6,000 boxes (sic) of gun-powder. I have just written and passed this information down to Bahrein together with ^Bin Saud s remarks about this and other alleged hostile acts of King Hussain s. All this is rather disappointing, and makes one fear that these two rulers are not likely to live in peace. 49. Saturday, Sht July = 14th J)hit QaacW.j—Ahmad Thanaiyan called on us and sat an hour or so. States no reply received as yet from Bahrein regarding Bin Saud's proposal to send with us a small body of Nejd Hajj party, in charge of one of the As-Saud, ruling, family. Hints that he himself may be selected for the job. He says the Imam's mind is not a little disturbed to see that Government presses him to go to Mecca with a very limited follow- in^ and without arms. Wondered if Government really considered situation or' knew the full facts about Bin Saud. Bahrein and Baghdad did not sufficiently advocate his cause, so it was ignored and nothing came of his repeated representations : (he even said Major Dickson had no power, but only passed Bin Saud's communications on to Baghdad, which in its turn passed them on to London ; that decisions were made and orders were passed m London without fully knowing circumstances and facts). I had to argue matter and lecture to him on the point to correct his views, and iarhan also spoke, till at last Ahmad saw his own mistake. 60. In the afternoon Bin Saud called us and took us round his Mud hi f, guest-house, a big square hall with balconies in front. It is a two-storey building which is iust completed.- In one corner on the ground floor there is the ' Matbakh ' (kitchen) where 10 or 12 huge kettles were ready with hot pulao (rice and mutton), while some sixty to seventy men sat dmmg in three eroups upstairs. They were eating out of big round trays. I was told that some of the kettles contained two goats' meat and 60 lbs. nee, and others three eoats and 80 lbs of rice. Several scores of men had already caned and some more were waiting outside for their turn. Bin Saud said, with an air o self- satisfaction, that that feeding was going on daily with very slight increase or decrease in number of guests and visitors who are also joined by Imam e slaves or servants. 51. After the Maghrib prayer Bin Saud called us both to his private Mailis, and spoke first about Kuweit-Mutair affairs, which evidently worried him a eood deal. He said that he asked for Government s intervention at the very out-set, but was told that he had better settle it up himself with Shaikh Salim. Now that he was going to do so, Government had changed their mind, and were reminding him of his treaty obligations to submit the dispute to Government's arbitration which he was willing to do. 52 Then the conversation turned to climate and sanitation of Riyadh and need for a doctor. Doctor Harrison had been called through Political Agent, but had been reported to be absent in India. Bin Saud said that Dr. Harrison was liked in Neid as he adopted Arab dress and manners and spoke Arabic. An English doctor of such nature'and manners and of a good moral character would be equally welcojne in Riyadh. An Indian Muslem doctor was not necessarily required, but only proposed by Bin Saud in view of the general prejudice which a Christian could gradually overcome as Dr. Harnsou had succeeded in doing by visiting Hassaand Riyadh.53. A large wooden bowl of fresh camel's milk sent us. Bin Saud takes this as only food at night. It is excellent to drink and very refreshing. 54i. Sunday, let Augusts loth Dhil Qaadah. —At dawn several-rifle shots fired in front of the palace ^ Reason discovered later: a ' Bashir ' (bearer of good news) has arrived with letters for the Imam stating the Akhwan of Sufainahand Suwairaqiyah have captured the village Al-Harra near Medina. My informer adds that the Akhwan have killed 400, i.e., nearly all the inhabitants of that unhappy village, not sparing even women and children. They were Bani Abdullah, a section of the numerous Mutair Arabs inhabiting the borders of the Hejaz and Nejd and often changing sides with King Hussain or Bin Saud, just as it suited them. Sufainah and Suwairiqiyah are instances of Hejaz villages freshly gained by the Akhwan and pushed forward to make Btill more conquests for militant Wahhabism. Nothing is nearer the Bedouin heart than ' Ghazu ** (raiding, plundering and rapine) and when this is sancti fied by ' Tadaiyun ' (lit. becoming wholly religious : now signifying the adoption of the new Akhwan creed) there can be no limit to the Badu cruelty and ferocity in cases like the above. The Imam's brother, Abdullah, is credited with an expression of adherence to have uttered in his Majlis, with many men present, that these blind fanatics must one day be visited with the wrath of God and be doomed to destruction. I wonder if Bin Saud shares such pious or limited sentiments. Later, when I saw Bin Saud and asked him (after waiting to see if he would mention it) about the firing, etc., he said it was an ordinary event; nothing of importance : a man had brousrht news of some fighting and so-called Akhwan success in a distant place on the borders of Nejd and asked for a Dhulul (riding camel) as his own had died of fatigue on the road : he, Bin Saud, would give the man one, as he was accustomed to do in such cases. This was not telling the whole truth. 55. At noon wrote letters to Bahrein, then tried to sleep but could not owing to heat and flies, the latter a great nuisance and seem to be over-growing. Punkha and hand-fans are a great necessity and we employ both as much as possible. 66. After(afternoon) prayers Bin Saud sent us horses and we rode out and met him on his way to the Badu camp, outside Riyadh. Bin Saud wa« riding a very fine mare, a thorough-bred Arab from Jabal Shammar, the best that I have seen. His sons Saud and Faisal and brother Abdullah, several cousins and about two dozen attendants accompanied on good mares. Bin Saud talked on horses and pointed out various gardens and buildings on the way. Reaching the camp, we sat in a big open tent in the centre of some 200 ' Buyut Shaar ' ( tents) scattered over a distance of 1J miles all around. The host is one Salaihi (?), a nice old Badu who has charge of the Imam's camels. Sat about three-quarters of an hour, had the three rounds of coffee, and all the time Bin Saud talked of camels, their uses, kinds, diseases, etc., etc. There was a bustle as hundreds of camels were; returning from the wadis after the day's grazing, and were formed into batches and taken to w T ater on a large well close by. There were over 200 white camels which were part of the recent booty from Bin Rashid, of which the Imam's share alone is said to be 3,000. These are distributed over several different places for convenience of grazing. Prayed Maghrib with the Imam and party, and noticed a slight softening of Wahhabi . (A.khwan) faces around ; perhaps we were, after all, regarded as somewhat like themselves, pseudo-Moslems, if not Moslems. 57. Monday, 2ni August = 16th Dhil Qaadah. —'Wrote letters to Bahrein. Bin Saud is again preparing to send a Ghazu against Bin Rashid. He told me that the youthful Bin Rashid was only a puppet in the hands of his uncle, Ibn Ajal, who was very anti-Bin Saud. His policy would prove suicidal. Most of Shammar and townsmen of Hail hated Ibn Ajal, whose downfall was only a question of time. The Sherif and Shaikh Salim both tried to incite and help Bin Rashid. Salim and Bin Rashid had sent letters and presents to the Sherif through a Kuweit merchant who has a branch in Bombay. Bin Saud said his position was made difficult by the fact that he had to deal with a foreign power. He was not free to do what he liked with those who troubled him. If he were let alone by the English he could finish it up in no time with the Sherif, with balim and Bin Eashid. He did not want conquest : he only wanted rest and peace. If he had not been compelled by circumstances to pull on, he would have left the country and gone to live in a distant island or some unknown corner of the world and there worshipped God.11 58. Information received one Abbas-al Fallaj arrived from Syria ten davs ago ; probably a secret messenger : in camping outside Riyadh, near Imam's garden. Has five horses and several attendants. Is said to have come thrice before. 59. Two big Akhwan Mullas, Muhammad Bin Abdul Latif of Arta\riyah »nd Abdul Aziz Angari of Saderah. are also visiting the Imam to-dav. 60. In the evening (8 to 9 p m .) the Imam read out a portion of Hadith (traditions) to a large gathering of Mullahs and other visitors from the mofussil ia his Majlis and then delivered a lecture of sermon on obedieDce to God and His Prophet as an essential qualification of a Muslim and a Momin (true believer). I could easily hear every word he uttered as I was on the next roof. An Aslim, probably Shaikh Abdullah Bin Abdul Latif, strongly supported what the Imam had said quoting from Al-Quran. 61. I am afraid it is getting rather late for the Hajj. Bin Saud has not had Government's answer as yet, and we are strained in Iliyadh. 62. Tuesday, 3rd August-=. 17th Dhil Qaadah, —With Bin Saud^ permission Farhan and myself went and saw the old imam Abdur Rahman at his house. He is a nice old man, looks over 70, of short stature, rather dark and stout, with hina-dyed beard of medium size. Talks slowly in a low voice and wears a contented look and a pleasant smile. Asked me what part of India I came from and where I learnt my Arabic. Was glad when told that Arabic was taught in public as well as private schools in India. Also said that my name was familiar to him, as he had heard it many years ago w r ben the famous Wahhabi Maulvi Siddiq Hasan Khan carried on his campaign of religious lectures and debates throughout India and Hejaz, more especially Mecca, where he was reputed to have * defeated ' the Ulama of the other Sunni sects in public debates. It may be noted that this gentleman is the author of several Wahhabi books. He rose in life by dint of his great eloquence, and knowledge, and married the last Begum of Bhopal, Sultan Jahan Begum (mother of the present Begum), whereupon he was styled Nawab Siddiq Hasan Khan. 63. The old Imam also asked us about Shaikh Isa's health and the welfare of his sons, and professed his good will and regard for them, calling them the best ' Hamula ' (house). Bin Saud also joined us after a quarter of an hour. I was not a little surprised to see him stoop low down, kiss his father's hand, and then sit at a distance, near the nrdinary (&lt; Hshiyah ' (adherents) of his father. It did impress one to see this wise, capable and strong ruler, who is so much feared and respected by all, pay so great a respect to his old father. I have come to know since our arrival here, in Riyadh, that Bin Saud takes his father's advice and counsel in all important matters, more especially in matters concerning his relations with these outside Nejd. We conveyed Major Dickson's salaams, and the old Imam accepted them with pleasure and uttered the usual prayer and good wishes in reply. Bin Saud was so kind as to commend us both to his father, who blessed us. After having a little more ordinary talk and two rounds of coffee, we returned to our quarters. 64. We passed the day in-doors, feeling rather dull and worried. In the evening, after Maghrib prayer, Bin Saud called us to his private Majlis, and told us with evident satisfaction that his own proposals had been accepted by Government, and he had just then received Major Dickson's letter conveying Sir Arnold Wilson's approval of same and his appreciation of Bin Saud's statesman-like solution of the problem. He would, accordingly, send a repre sentative with us in charge of as many Nejdis as may be ready to go to Mecca for the Hajj. Time was very short, but we could reach by riding light and fast. After some discussion Bin Saud fixed Thursday, the 5th August' for our departure to Mecca. A great relief. One cannot long put up with the hatred seen in every face outside the little circle of the Imam's immediate entourage and those attending to our needs. Ibrahim Shammari, Ibn Shalhub and Ahmad Thanaiyan would have us believe that they are equally looked down upon by the Akhw r an whom they hate in return. Wednesday, 4th August = 16th Dhil Qaadah. —Information received that one Hazam-Al-Alayin, a notable of Anezah, and Shabib Bin Araiiii, headman of Al-Umur section of Bani Khalid, have arrived on a visit to the Imam. Also Shaikhs Muhammad Bin Abdullah of Al-Attar and Mubarak Bu Ithnain of Ar-Rumah arrived this morning with a large following. All these have tribal disputes to settle.66. At 9 a.m Bin Saud visited us, after sendicg Ahmad Thanaiyan tn warn us a few minutes before -hand. This is his first call, though we have been seeing him at his own request or invitation at least daily. He used to sit alone in the small private Majlis outside his office or in the big ' Roshan ' (hall) adjoiniT g our quarters and to send word for us to join him. In the evening he usually received us on the roof lying between one of his private houses and office which is reached by walking about 50 yards Irom our verandah and passing in front of the ' Koshan ' ^hall) and the office. 67. Bin Saud sat about 20 minutes talking of ordinary ipatters. He very kindly said that he stepped in to see if we did not -want anything and were comfortable; that he had been telling his men daily that we must be well looked afier, and had been sending Ahmad Thanaiyan and Bin Shalhub to be quite sure of that; that he had been taking our own word that we were quite comfortable. I assured him that we did not want anything and thanked him for his kindness and consideration. He also said that he hoped that we did not mind his not visiting us in our quarters till then, but that he did not like to disturb us, and preferred to meet us in the Roshan or the Majlis, both being about midway between his office and our quarters. I said it was quite immaterial and we were extremely obliged for his excellent hospitality and great regard always shewn us from the moment we had arrived in his capital. He also said ihat [ must have found the time hanging rather heavily as there were no books or newspapers to read, nor any places of interest to visit. I replied that I had the ' Sabaah Mualliqah *' (old chivalrous Arab poems), Manasik Al Hajji (on the pilgrimage to Mecca), two useful and interesting books with me to read, and sometimes wrote letters, morning and evening; the greater part of the day was too hot to allow of any reading or writing. We could not even otfer the Imam the commonest thing, coffee, as our coffee -boy had locked up the room and gone out. So I had to content myself by apologising and saying ' that after all it was his own house, and w T e his own gi^ests ; he would kindly excuse the shortcoming, whereupon Bin Saud repeated his favourite couplet (O, our guest, if you visit us you w T ill find that we are (like) guests and you (like) the host),' and then departed saying that he was going to Shaikh Abdullah Bin Abdul Latif's, to try and reconcile this powerful old Shaikh to a numjber of 4 Muta wiah ' (mullas or priests)- who have been summoned for disobeying Shaikh Abdullah's injunctions regarding public preaching and disposal of cases, etc., etc. Some of these worthies have been reported publicly criticising Bin Saud's policy a ad relations with the other rulers and the * Ajanib v (foreigners) and preaching * Shiddah ' ,(Jehad) against all non-Nejdis, who are Kafir to their mind. Inw T ardly, I thought, perhaps the old Imam Abdur Kahman, whom we had visited the previous day, was responsible for sending Bin Saud to see us. 68. A little later Bin Saud sent Farhan and myself, one volume each of the books (History of Nejd and Wahhabi movement). This written in old style Arabic, but abuses other - Moslem sects, as could be expected of such a sectarian compilation, 69. Received further information regarding Bin Musaid. He has captured Hajlah and Ibhah, the chief towns of Assir, and the ruler Bin Mhrai (AI-' A'ayadh) is said to have been driven away to the hills. This Bin M'usaid is one of the Al-Jilovi, nephew of the well-known Abdullah Bin Jilovi, Amir of Hassa. The Imam Idrisi is on Bin Musaid's {i .e.. Bin Saud's) side and has been chitfiy instrumental in this Akhwan victory. There has been much blood shed in Ibha (said to be about as large &gt; as Riyadh) and a majority of the inhabitants perished with the Akhwan sword. Report also says that the &lt;?a:-Turkish WaH, now a servant of the Idrisi, took part in this action. Akhwan loss only ]5 men ahd 4 horses. 70. Called on Bin Saud after Asr prayer. Sat talking of common things for about ten minutes. He is going off to see his brother who is camping outside Riyadh. Bin Saud was kind enough to ask (as he does each time when we see him) if we wanted anything. We thanked him sincerely and replied we did not. He also asked us to excuse any shortcomings in, what he called Badu-like, arrangements for food, etc. I assured him that we were quite comfortable and were served with excellent food and plenty of13 Iruit ancl felt quite at home. He rather disappointed us hy saying that arrangements for our departure have not been completed, and we should not be •able to start to-morrow, but will Lave to delay our departure till Saturday next. Have rather anxious time. Wish we may not be too late for the Hajj. Starry night, beautifully cool and calm with a li&lt;rht dry Shimal wind. 70. Farhan Beg suggested that it would be convenient and desirable to have provisions of our own for the journey and for use in Mecca. He also pointed out that we should hav« to entertain Badu, etc., whom we might meet on the way, and would also be spared trouble or unpleasantness with Ahmad Thanaiyan and his party. He also pointed out with much emphasis that I should be able to invite Badu head men and others who might happen to be in or near our camps during the journey. I agreed and purchased all that was necessary. 71. Thursday, loth Augusts 19th Dhil Qaaduh. —Wrote letters to Bahrein. Am much depressed, feeling as if stranded here At 10 a.m ., Ibn Shalhub called on us with Bin Sulaiman a katib (secretary) of Bin Sa'ud. Latter wants medicine for his brother who is suffering from malarial fever and bronchitis. I give him some quinine pills and a little chlorodyne which is received very thankfully—almost as a boon—in the total absence of doctors and medicines here. Ibn Shalhui) inquires about our requirements lor the journey. We ask for 'two pairs of Mizwadas (bags) for carrying clothes and other kit, as the ekdans (boxes) we have brought w ith us from Bahrein are too bulky and inconvenient to be carried on the long journey to Mecca. Offers tents but we have brought two with us from Bahrein. Arms are, he • says, ordered to be supplied us as to all others going with us. After all, we are to go armed, let us hope, for'show only. 72. At 8 p.m . Bin Sa'ud calls us to his private mejlis, and speaks, in the some strain as before, against the Sharif, and the hopelessness of the proposed endeavours to make peace or find a modus wcendi) etc. I thought this was said preparatory to an excuse for still more delays or refusal to send even a representative with a small number of Nejdis. I said that I did not know how far the reports about King Hussein and his attitude of hostility to Bin Sa'ud were true but, even if all what Bin Sa*ud had from time to time heard and said on the subject were taken ior granted, it was only reasonable and human to try and put an end to enmity.and ill-will, that it was His Britannic Majesty's Government's oft-expressed desire that their two great friends Kinf» Hussein and Bin Sa'ud should live in peace ; that both of them had expressed their willingness to meet each other and discuss matters in a friendly way; that after several alternate proposals, the present one had been put forward by Bin Sa'ud himself and accepted by His Majesty's Government, and that it was up to him to put it into action and thereby show T his readiness to accommodate matters. I added that if this latest proposal of sending his representative and a suitable number of Nejdis for the Hajj and for making preliminary negotiations for peace was not acted upon by him, a very good opportunity would be lost and i\iQ bond fide of bis intentions in the matter could possibly be doubted, etc. As previously instructed. Shaikh Farhan supported my above argument, and spoke with less ceremony saying that Government had had too much of that game of shilly-shally, and had got tired of the feuds and mutual recriminations Of King Hussain and Bin Saud and there must be an end to that attitude ; that Colonel Wilson and Major Dickson who were sincere friends find supporters of Bin Sa'ud would be disappointed and displeased if h^ evaded the sSiution which must be pushed through ^ith out any further delay and so on and so forth. 73. At last Bin Sa'ud shook off the last doubts or reluctance lingering in his mind and definitely promised to send with us Ahmad Thanaiyan and as many Nejdis as might be ready equipped for the journey. He fixed upon Ahrrad Thanaiyan after discussing the pros and cons with us and said that his first choice would be Bin Suwailim, the Amir of Qatif, but that he could not be called up in time. Saturday, the 21st Dhil Qa'adah=:7th August, was then fixed for our departure, and we thanked him heartily, took leave to return to our quarters to find the big wooden bowl of fresh camel's milk awaiting us, as usual before bed-time. 7ij. Friday, 6th August=20th Dhil Qa'adah. —Wrote letters and then called on Sa'ud Bu Sharrain, the eldest son of Bin Sa'ud, whom we had met / U31 F&amp;PD14 • twice only by chance along v?ith many others. I have been slow to go round on visits. The reason is firstly that no one is a-calling on us as it is not the custom here, I am told, though personally I doubt it very much and put it down to the religious apathy of the pious Wahhabi. Surely they must be visiting one another, more especially those of their class who come from a far place. Secondly, I have come to know that Bin Sa'ud does not like the idea of our going about and mixing with any of his people—he arranged our visit to his father the Other day at my own request and with some reluctance. Thirdly, I am sure we could not be welcome visitors to all or most houses here as we are stracgers, non'Nejdis and non-Wahhabis, and nor could we expect return calls. 75. It was interesting to learn that Bu Sharrain was a naughty slave boy, and the name was adopted by Sa'ud in his boyhood as he too loved games and fights and tried to excell his playmates. He still retains it with pride. He is about 19 or 20 years old, rather handsome, of a cheerful disposition and affable manner. Most of the conversation was about his recent 4 Ghazu' (expedition) against Bin Rashid, of which he was very proud. He said, if what fhe ' Basrah Times ' had published was true, I should not have found him alive. One proof of his success was the presence of so many white Shammar camels, which I had myself seen, and those who were only a small portion of the booty. He also said in course of conversation that he would some day like to ^o to Wilayah (England). He very much regretted having missed the last opportunity owing to ill-healtb, when Faisal was sent instead of him. Sa'ud has a large establishment and many slaves, who are all well-dressed and very orderly. We were entertained with home-made sweets, grapes, melons and sherbet and coffee. Glad to find the second pleasant and sociable man in Riyadh,, the first being Bin Saud himself. 76. Prayed in the Jamia mosque for the second time. Surprised to see a majority of men entering the mosque with shoes on. Before beginning to, pray, shoes are taken off and placed in front almost touching the head when the ' Sijdah(prostration) part of the prayer is performed. This is truly Wahhabi, First row behind the Imam (leader in prayer, Shaikh Abdullah bin Abdul Latif) is occupied by Bin Sa'ud, his father, brothers, sons and relations and retainers. There are about 20 rows of 200 to 250 men each. The mosque is spacious but low-roofed, and of a very simple unornamented type. Evjen the mosques in our villages in India are better in every way, to say nothing of those of towns. So much for Wahhabi simplicity or puritanism. 77. At 4 p.m a big dust-storm or hurricane arose from the North and soon spread all over, making it as dark as night. Windows and doors bad to be shut, and after half an hour a fairly heavy shower of rain fell and drove away the dust. Water flowed down from roofs into streets, but after an hour the ground looked dry again This rain is quite an unexpected boon r they seldom have rain here at this time of the year, their usual rainy season being a brief spell during rabia (spring). x 78. After Maghrib, Bin Sa'ud had the selected camels collected from two or three grazing centres outside Riyadh, brought before himself. He con descended to examine each one of these excellent mounts and ordered one or two to be substituted by better ones. This shows what a thorough man he really is. He could well have left this job to a servant, but 'Abdul' Aziz did' it himself and remained standing in the street in front of the qasr (palace) for quijte an hour examining the beasts, their 'shidads' (saddles), trappings, etc., and asking questions and making remarks about some of his favourite beasts. 79. He then returned to his usual sitting-place on the roof between his office and private house and there called us. As soon as we sat down he said - that all arrangements for our journey to Mecca had been completed and we .could start early next morning. Ahmad Thanaiyan was to attend to some minor details that evening and to consult us regarding cooks, attendants, etc. It was most important to go as light as possible and yet take everything of necessity as nothing except 'dhabihas' (goats or sheep) could be had on the way. We had every thing we required and were quite ready to go. He then said that he had told me all what he had in his mind about the Sharif. Whatever the Sharif's views, hopes, etc., might be, he himself was always willing and anxious to make a peaceful settlement with King Hussein whomhe regarded like his father. The letter he was sending with Ahmad Thanaij'an would be shown me before it was closed, and a copy sent to Major Dickson. It was as friendly as be could possibly make it, and he was in addition instructing his representative, Ahmad Thanaiyan, to be as conciliatory and accmmodating in all respects as may be compatible with reason and propriety. He, then said that he had ordered a ' mahmil ' (open box-like thing tied on a camel for ridini? in) for me, as he feared that the ordinary ' shidad ' (camels saddle) riding would be too much for me in that hot time of the year. I thanked him heartily and then we said good-bye to this perfect gentleman and wise ruler at about y-45 p.m . as he advised us to start at 4 a.m . next morning and to await Ahmad Thanaiyan and his party in Daraiyah. The last words of the Imam to me were very flattering : ' I hope our friendship now made will always con tinue to grow. If you possibly can try and come back this way, or at least send Farhan with Ahmad Thanaiyan ', to which I replied, ' In-sha-Allah, I shall try and do so.' We departed and went to our quarters. I felt as if I had not sufficiently thanked the Imam for the great friendship, courtesy and regard he had shown me, but Farhan had said quite a lot in the usual Arab way for both of us. 80. At about 19 p.m . Bin Shalhub, with another brought us the arms : one sword with golden work on scabbard and hilt, and one rifle (Turkish army pattern 1331 = 1912) and one belt with 100 rounds a-piece for each of us. 81. Saturday, 7th Augu8t=2l8t Dhil Qa\i(iah. —Eise early about 4 p m. and find seven horses and eight camels ready. After making necessary prepara tions, assortment, loading, etc., started at 5 a.m . and went out of the town through the north (Bin Suwailim) gate. Farhan and myself rode on horses, and the re maining five horses were ridden by five of Bin Sa'ud's slaves—strong, bearty lads. My two servants Ibrahim and Ghazi and Farhan's servant Hamad, each rode a camel—cbmparatively heavier beasts which in addition carried our kit, a fourth camel was under our / coffee-boy Abdur Hahman (Dahaim) bin Musaid bin Mubarak Ad-Dosari of Kharaj, the fifth carried the mahmil, counterbalanced by two bags of my kit, the sixth was ridden by Sa'aid, a Shammari Arab. He was our whole-time attendant in Riyadh and was useful in giving me inform ation. He was one of the Arab irregulars who had served the Turkish forces in the Hejaz, had become a prisoner in the Tarrabah affair, or rather joined the victorious Akhwan incognito, came down to Riyadh, where he married and settled down as one of Bin Sa'ud's personal attendants. The remaining two camels, excellent, light ' Omaniyat ' were going along fully equipped with beautiful ' shidads ' (saddles) and trappings to carry us onwards from Darai yah for the Imam had thought it rather unsafe to ride these from the very outset, they having been grazing out for a long time without being ridden on. 82. When this little train of men andfiften beasts was about to pass out of the gate, one Abdur Rahman, an elderly man came up nearer, and salaamed us in the correct Arab fashion. This surprised me, as it was the first ' Salaam-o- Alaikum ' (salutation) uttered for us in or near Riyadh,lio one having done so at all nor even replied to our own salaams, wnich I always took care to say first (as a Moslem is commanded to do) whenever passing by any Arabs. Farhan often quarrelled with me for ' wasting salaams ' on those who did not care to receive or reply to them but, on the contrary turned away their faces, or ' muttered half-audible curses. Sa'aid told me that this man was a distant relation of Bin Sa'ud's and had been to Mecca twice at the head of the Neid pilgrimages. As we passed along we wished us God-speed, and declared emphatically that time was very short and we should b6 very fortunate if we succeeded in catch ing the Hajj. 88.- The road, a common route, passes through beautiful gardens on both sides and then lies over rocky ground for some miles. The gardens are enclosed in mud walls ranging from six to ten feet or more in height. A few miles out are to be seen half a dozen wells scattered about north and west of Riyadh. These are used for the irrigation of wheat, barley, etc., which is grown here to «ome extent, though the chief grain supply is from Kharaj and its neighbour hood.84. At about 7 a.m . we came upon a good pucca well and a small mosque built on the road at the Tmam's expense. The well is said to have cost 2,000 dollars. Halted and took water which is very good and plentiful, but found at a depth of 60 feet or more. It is midway between Riyadh and Daraiyah, and therefore a great convenience to travellers. We left Irgah, a small hamlet of some 50 houses of farmers and gardeners about 1J miles south-west of the road. 85 Arrived Daraiyah at 9 a.m . This little town lies low down in a Wadi surrounded by rugged rocks. The route is stony, narrow and pteep, with a half-demolished stone wall reaching up to the rock, which forms natural forti fication on three sides, on one side being Wadi Hanifah, a dry rocky river-bed with high banks. There are many date-palms, fruit-gardens and other trees in and around the town. It was long the capital of Nejd and was deserted by the As-Saud after the Turco-Egyptian invasion and terrible defeat and persecu tion by the Turks some 60 years ago. There are many big old houses and buildings, and a very big Jamia mosque in a half-ruinous state. The population has very much dwindled as Eiyadh about 15 miles away now flourishes as the capital. The Amir, a coarse Badu-looking man of about 60, met us at the corner of the street and took us to his mejlis where we had coffee. After an hour grapes, apricots and water-melons were served, and at noon the usual Arab lunch in a big round ' Siniyah ' tray of rice with a whole sheep on top. We were left alone in the mejlis the whole day, the Amir keeping at a respectful (shall I say hateful) distance, making his appearance only twice for a few minutes. His little son a good lad, looked alter us and I made him some ' ikram ' (present). 86. Ahnwid Thanaiyan was late and caused some anxiety. At last he ar rived at 10 p.m . and explained the delay by saying that the Imam had certain things to settle and instructions to give him, so he could not start long before sunset. His party was unexpectedly small. When asked the reason he told me that both the Imam and he himself had refused to let more men join, because the time Fas dangerously short and a large number of men would only be an encumbrance. 87. The Nejd pilgrim party consisted of the following men;— 1. Shaikh Ahmad Bin 'Abdullah Ath-Thanaiyan As-Sa'ud (Bin Sa'ud's cousin and representative). 2. 'Abdullah Bin Hasan Ad-Daghaisar (a notable and distant relation of Bin Sau'd). , ' f . 3. Shaikh 'Abdullah Bin Khalaf (mutawwa or priest). 4. Abdur Eahman Bin Sufairan [personal attendant of (1): accompa nied him to England], 5. Muhammad Bin Qabb [personal attendant of (1)]. 6. Nasir Bin Qabb (coffee-maker). 7. Fahaid Bin Abdur Rahman of Riyadh. 8. Abdur Raliman Bin Mubarak of Riyadh. 9. Sa'ad Bin Muqairim of Riyadh. 10. Hamad-al Tarair of Riyadh. 11. Ibrahim Bin Darban of Riyadh. 12. Abdul Wahhab of Jabal Shammar. 13. Muhammad Bin Saif of Riyadh. 14. Ibn 'Ajjaj of Riyadh. ^ 15. Sagar-al-Atawi, Badu guide. 16. Aayidh Bin Man gash, Badu guide, 17. Abdul Hadi. 18. Hasan-al-Rogi, Badu guide. 19. Abdur Rahman Bin Nassar, cook. * 20. Sulaiyim negro, camel-man and general attendant. 21. Bakhit, negro, camel-man and general attendant.17 22. Ibrahim Negro, camel-man and general attendant. 23. Abdur Rahman Bin Mus^id Doeari, camel-man and general atten- 24. Ibn Amran, camel-man and general attendant. 25. Sa'ad-Allah camel-man and general attendant. 26. Ibn Umar camel-man and general attendant. 27. 'Abdullah of Sadair, camel-man and general attendant. 28. Sulaiman-al-Mutawwa of Qassim. 29. Marid of Qassim. 30. Dahaim of Qassim. 88. Apart from Ahmad Thanaiyan's above explanation, I personally think Bin Sa'ud must have decided at the last moment to curtail the Nejd pilgrims chiefly because he has little faith in the Sharif, and less hopes of a friendly and peaceable solution of the difficulties. In short, he may be inwardly expect ing that our Nejdi party will be roughly handled in the Hejaz, so why not let the risk or sacrifice be as small as possible. 89. We camped on the excellent cool sands of Wadi Hanifah outside and below (south-west) Daraiyah, took coffee, prayed ' Isha'* and then slept a few hours and started at 2 a. m . soon after the mooL had risen. The route lay over the bed of the said Wadi, with high rocky banks for abo^t 10 miles and then over stony ground. 90. The Imam's men with horses took leave for returning to Riyadh, and I gave them letters for Bin Sa'ud and Political Agent, Bahrein. They were all very good lads and I wished that I had asked for a loan of their services for the journey but it was too late then to think of it. Ahmad Thanaiyan, who had been charged with the arrangement of servants, when asked this evening as to those appointed for us said that he had ten or eleven followers who could work for the whole party but that none had been specified for us except our old Riyadh coffee-boy Dahaim. At 5 p.m . halted for ' Fajr prayers and then resumed the march. 91. Jubailah was reached at 7 a.m . It is a half-ruined kachcha fortress with a little village around it on an elevated ridge. A small wadi lies below it, and there are two wells at which some 200 camels were being watered, the water being drawn in large skin-buckets, drawn by two camels on opposite sides. We halted at one of the wells, and some of the party took water. The Amir sent us dates and coffee and after one hour's rest we started again, the road is now on a hard, sandy ground. 92. 'Awainah now in ruins, left about three miles to the north. It was once a prosperous town and the seat of the Al-Maamar rulers of Nejd, the predecessors of Al-Sa'ud, the present rulers. According to Ahmad Thanaiyan, the Al-Maamar perished in a terrible plague, which swept away 300,000 inhabitants of these parts, about 130 years ago. Some of the Al-Maamar are now serving under Bin Sa'ud, chiefly as Amirs. Pahad Bin Maamar, the present Amir of Qassim and Bin Saud's well-known general, is one of them. 93. At II a.m . we camped in a vast plain thinly covered with 'sumar' (Indian kikar) trees and ' ashab ' grass and surrounded by hills. This is called Jjahesiyah. We pitched our tents at a distance of some 40 yards from the ten of Ahmad Bin Thanaiyan and that of his party, as they had shown some aloofness on the way, often marching some 300 yards ahead of us, or keeping some distance behind. I had begun to feel and Farhan to say it out, that we were rather disagreeable companions to these men. Took tea and lay down in my little tent, feeling very tired alter nine hours' ride in the fl mahmil' which, though it was more comfortable than the ordinary ' shidad' (saddle), \^as very confining and jerky, especially as this was my first experience. Lunched at 12-30 and then slept for two hours or so. - 94. I was told that Zaid Bin Khattab (brother of Omar Ibn-al-Khattab, the second Caliph) and many other Sahabah (companions of the Holy Prophet) lay buried in this plain, but the site of their graves was not known, nor could anyone say in which of the early battles these pioneers of Islam had fallen. dant nix f &amp; pd95. Started at 4-30 p.m . and came out of the plain at sunset. Halted for Maghrib prayer, and then began to ascend a hilly track or pass, which was at times very narrow and steep, till at 9 p.m . got down into a rugged deep valley, the camels going very slowly and patiently. We were left far behind, and it was too dark to see even the last of the party ahead of us. Even the usual warning song, 44 Ya Saiyd, Ya Saiya' sung by Dahaim, our coffee-boy, at the top of his voice brought no response, showing we were far behind our lighter and light-thinking friends. Half an hour's attempt to go faster and catch up with them also failed. Then Dahaim took up his rifle and fired four shots. Shortly afterwards Fahad came back running and took us about two miles further where w T e met the party and proceeded in silence till 12-30 a. m., when a halt was made in a plain just under the hills called Mirrkah. JNight was fairly cool and awfully calm. Slept immediately on lying down and was awaked at 4-30 a. m ., still feeling very tired. 96. Monday, 9th August=23rd Delhi Qaadah. —Started at 5 a.m., after 'Fajr' prayer. Are travelling over a level plain of hard soil, with dark brown rocks scattered around at a distance and high hills far away to the north of the route. At 7-30 a. m . arrive at a small mud-tower with a large mud-house attached to it. This is called Barra tower. There are several wells close by where our camels are watered and our water-skins re-filled with fresh water. The water of the outer wells is slightly bitter, but that of a well in the tower is sweet. Break-fasted and resumed the march at 9 a.m. 97. Barra, a small village in a little green plain, w ith good date-palms and bare hills around, lies about two miles away to the north and looks rather picturesque from the road. Passed by a small ' qasr', or summer-house, about 2^ miles west of Barra and halted at 11 a. m . at the farther western end of the plain of Barra, where there was good pasture for the camels, but no treea or shade except the poor shade of our light tents. The sum and glare were very discomforting, and the Shimal wind did not help to relieve the heat. Lunched at noon and slept a little out of sheer fatigue as every bone in the body ached as if pounded in a mortar. This is the second day of the journey and I have not had a word with Ahmad Thanaiyan or anyone else of the party, who are all keeping aloof from us, nor 'has Farhan; though he has several times been riding close by their side, while myself and the three servants and Dahaim can go at a lower speed, our beasts being comparatively heavily laden than theirs. My companion (or host), Ahmad Thanaiyan, only sent me a leg of mutton both times yesterday and to-day as soon as a sheep was killed on halting at noon, and I thanked him through Dahaim, who brought it. I mean to wait and see. Farhan says we must not lower ourselves in their estimation by falling in with them unless and until they salaam and speak to us first or visit us in our tent and join us in eating and drinking as we repre sent His Britannic Majesty's Government and are the guests of their ruler. I concur. 98. Started at 4 p.m ., after saying collective ^Zuhr' and Asr'* prayers, as yesterday. At 8 p. m. we arrived in Shumaisah, a small low r - lying valley surounded by barren hills. There are two wells here and a small Badu (Ataibah) camp. The headman, with five others came and took coffe with us They have large flocks of excellent sheep, but a small number of camels and half a dozen dogs ^o guard the sheep from wolves and thieves. After, watering our camels and taking fresh water,,which is very good, we resumed our march at 10 p. m . and after an hour came to a sandy plain with deep sands and . high dunes called Nafud, round and over many of which our camels walked slowly and laboriously. There was no sign of a route or track for hours, but our guide, Sagar-al-Atawi, led us with an air of certainty, he himself being guided by the stars, which shone brightly in the dark moonless night. At about midnight there were two or three brief pauses to let those behind catch up ; one camel rather heavily laden w r ith provisions refused to climb over a high dune, and the keeper, Bakhit negro, shouted out ' ala hun, ala hun' (go slow, go slow), when we all stopped at the top and then sent down two men who brought up the poor lingerer. We had hoped to finish w ith this sandy portion but at 1 a . m . found ourselves still surrounded by dunes and came to the conclusion that we had lost our way. Man and beast wefe tired to the19 last degree, and a halt was made, every body failing asleep almost immediately on this nice and cool bed of sand. 99. Tuesday, 10th Aug U8t=24th DIM Qa'adah. —The usual shouts of ' Gumu Sallu ' roused us and after hurrying through the brief 'Fajr ' prayer, we started at 5 a. m . coining out of the Nafud, a sea of sand, at 7 a. m.,' when the route, a slight track, lay over an undulating plain of hard soil. The ground was at times black and rocky. The wind is ' gharbi ' (west) to-day and is rather hot and dry unlike the Shimal (north) which prevailed till yester day. There is fair amount of Ashab and Afraj to which the poor beasts help themselves while on the march. 100» At 11-30 a.m . halted in the far (S.-W.) corner of the plain called Huwaitaniyah. Here there are two little camps of about 20 to .25 Buyut Shaar (tents) of the Dalahibah (Ataibah) Bedouin. Large flocks of sheep and goat are to be seen over the farthest end of the plain under the rocks to our south and east, also about iOO camels. There are two wells near the Badu camp whence we obtain water. But it is dirty and bitter with a pecu liar smell. I could take only a little of it with difficulty and preferred to remain thirsty. Earhan and the others who drank more freely got many motions the same afternoon and my bottle of chlorodyne was handy. 101. It is the hottest day we have had so far ; the hot wind, the dust and the glare added to growing fatigue make life most unpleasant. Cannot sleep or rest or do anything but lie down covered with a blanket which affords but little protection or relief. The condensed milk and pine-apple I have brought are more freely used than on the three previous days and two big ' badiyas '* (wooden bowls) of milk and water with sugar added, two tins of pine-apple and some biscuits sent over to Ahmad Thanaiyan's tent, bring us a return of good home-made cakes and ' ugga ' or dried powder like whey, which makes a really enjoyable and very cooling drink. 102. Ghazi, my khalasi, used also as a cook, was too ill to be able to prepare our lunch so we had to do without it. We all, especially Farhan and myself, have little appetite or inclination for the sort of food we are getting here (rice and mutton cooked together) and cold drinks are profusely used to supply the want. 10'3. Farhan ^oes and talks to Ahmad Thanaiyan who comes to my tent with a sorry face, saying that he was ashamed to face me as he had been under a misapprehension about servants and attendants for the journey. He supposed the Iman had fixed it up himself, and so overlooked the matter. Those he had then were good for nothing, etc. I did not want to make much of the matter, and so put him at ease by saying that I did not mind it at all, as my own servants were sufficieDtly looking after me. 104. No rest possible, so make early start at 2-30 p.m ., the idea is to reach Al-Mughirah early to-night, as we are practically without water. Route lies over level sandy ground till 4 p m ., when we have four or five miles of deep sands and dunes to go over and at 5-30 p.m . comedown upon another level bit of hard ground covered with plenty Ashab, etc. We now see in front of us, to the south and west a chain of black rocks behind which is the Mughirah water. Halted once at 4 p.m ., for the ' Asr ' prayer and again at 6-30 p.m . for ' Maghrih ' and ' Isha ' prayers (collective), and took tea and coffee, starting again at 8 p.m . It will be noted that we do not and cannot bother about dinner since leaving Daraiyah, as that would be too much of a luxury and, what is more, would waste two or three hours of the night, the suitable time for travelling. Tea with milk and biscuits, etc. make a substitute for dinner. Besides, one could hardly ride on a camel six or seven hours rucmug after taking dinner. It would also induce sleep which was so much to be avoided. 105. Mughirah was reached after 12-30 a.m . Here also was a temporary camp of the Ataibah Dalahibah Badu who had come down from their northern homes or wandering-places on account of a false alarm that Ibn Rashid's men were going to attack them. These are better-looking desert people than any met with so far, and their women are comparatively well- dressed and wear silver and gold rings and earrings. They do not cover their faces but only draw the top portion of their Abas over their foreheads andii) eyes, if a siranger happens to be close by. Our camels were taken to water rasa ssr , ' 0 '' ho '' - •, M if. trednesday,11th Avy m t=2oth Mil from Mughirah valley at 6 a m ., I saw only one large well near where we oamned but another is said to be further up the valley. Water is very 'ooJ S and sweet, the route lies over a stony plateau or elevated plain in which there are sei era! beds ot jet black stones or pebbles sometimes mixed up with white ' there if iirwik 't TTh , The f were P atches of good 'ashab' here and , ■ ^ bills ot a dull dark colour were visible far awav to the south and he west and smaller rocks to , he north At 10 a.m ., halted^ in a plaL near wflVvIrt ' Awairidh stretching to the south and south-east, ft Mas very not again and the camels having had little ffrazin? were left to graze, as there ^\as good pasture around us near by. 107. At 11 a.m . Karhan and myself went to Ahmad Thanaivan's fpnt ^ where we took tea and then coffee. About half aZLn Thl com-' tn 'V' f hl8 f ^ left T Secin S us aPP^oach it and went o^r to the other open tent of servants and followers. Ahmad Thanaivan read and interpreted in Arabic extracts from a French paper called L'Jsie JraUc 'HkMaeL^ K 1 f% n .V me A laSt Pleading article was beaded Amir pTnnri ^ 0 I IJ™ comrne nted upon a public speech of OTt the dutv i if f e H 0n 0 S relatio,ls with the Allies and pointed out tlie duty and task of the Syrians. ^ Also a column on in Mesopotemia'' which the paper alleged, were due to the harsh treatment of he natives by the English etc, Ahmad Thanaiyan said that the editor bad been awarded a gold medal by King Hussein, and consequently the King's untiringly 3 SOnS ' AU and 'Abdullah were sung iu that paper 108, Lunched at 12-30, and slept two hours in spite of.the ' gharbi ,r and sun s heat. At 4 p.m . we started and soon entered a narrow valley or pass green with good tall 'Shab ' with dark grey rocks all round. The vllley goes wmdmg aloag for some miles. No road or track visible, but our guides Sagar and Aiyidh .are arbitrarily ordering the train 'tayamanu ' , (»o to ^ t e , 'fY 0r f : ^ asiru to the ,eft ) an '' ^ m0T e on } tm sunset, when the usual brut halt is made, 'Maghrib' and 'Isha' prayers finished with coffee taken and the march resumed at 7-80 p.m . One man with a letter has been sent aliead to Shahara, twelve hours from here. Ahmad Thanaivan writes requesting the Amir to have four camels in readiness to be purchased on arrival there to-morrow. These are needed for lightening those of our followers' refusing to more ^ been SOing slow and S ivill S trouble by 1—1 ^ | t W »i, haVe t u ef £ this morning and Dutcnidmi this after- noon, both to the north of our route distant three Or four hours. 110. Halted at 11-30 p m . in a plain called Arz-al-Jumairah. The night sleep ng ^ and ligIlt refreshmeil ts we lie down^to crUA ofVf Tnur8day ? 1 ; lh August~mh Phil, Q^arf^.—started at 4-80 a.m., ^ glad at the prospect of seeing a town, Sba'arah, after a five days'and nights^ mar 1 C iVn i 6 Se v r . , oute lles over a r0ck y and elevated plain studded with / ^ .1 i - 0 n ' J are scattered 0ver to north and west and a chain of - ~ of th 1'tr rn 1111 ! 1 ^ aS far ? tl i e eye Cai1 See nortll ' west to south-east. Some of the litneaillocks appear to be artificial mounds or towers of a conical s lape and being situated close together, one could imagine that these were ancient tombs like the Ihram-Al-Misr (Egyptian pyramids) only much smaller, or dwellings hewn out of rocks. ^ 1 \ 2; ii At ^' 3( i A ' M ' f. aw first g lim P ses ^ Sha'arah, rather a green line « hmff i a a • dlst f nce - 1,1 was reached at 11 a.m . A small town of under I hiSm called 400 f f rds loD ' ^ 200 ^ broad, situated T} / K ahailan on the west and in a level sandy wadi or alley. The town has a 'soor' (high mud wall) around it with three gates north, east and south, with rocks to the West. The Amir is one 'Abdullah—■— Bin Sa ad Bin Masaud of the Bani Za^'d 'who lias joined the Akhwan only last year and is a very staunch (fanatical) Akh, so much so that he did n9t come out to receive or even to see Ahmad Thanaiyan, who camped outside in the Rtnall grove of trees about 200 yards from the south gate. Alter waiting for an hour or so Ahmad Thanaiyan, obviously feeling very much insulted and chagrined went himself with two others, visited the Amir and returned to camp within half an hour. As a result of this visit we got the Amir 's ' dhiyafah 5 ' (feast) in the form of two goats, and some rice, coffee and sugar. But Ahmad Thar.ai- yan changed all his plans: no camels were available for purchase or hire : no attendance which had been promised me ; no one to take letters to Riyadh, and worst of all we were not to stay 24 hours for rest which we sorely needed, but must start after a few hours as Mecca was 11 days' journery at least. This last I could not swallow. I was, in addition to the inconvenience due to lack oi' efficient attendants, very sorry to sue my friend and assistant, Earlian, take so much trouble with our three untrained, inefficient followers, and only Dahaim to assist them. Farhan was unsparing in his efforts, and did not only coad the men to work, but himself performed a good deal of it like the piuting up and pulling down of tents, loading and unloading of the camels with the precious water-skins and adjustingshidads' etc., all rough work involving manual labour, which he was not supposed to do; but he did it ungrudgingly for my sake. 113, Sha'arah is the centre of trade between the Hejaz and Nejd ; has a bazaar in the centre where cloth, rice, sugar, coffee and spices are sold. Many a I adu caravan comes from all sides to buy their needs here. I now see about 50 Buyut Sha'ar lying half a mile south of the town, and a laige number of camels around the two wells Water is very good indeed. Thanks, however, to the Akhwan spirit, manifested in the Amir's refusal to meet no less a man than the cousin and representative of Bin Sa'ud, w e are not allow ed to enter the town and see it. There was a quite a long line of fresh-looking graves rear the camp, and I was told that Slia'arah had lost many of its inhabitants in the last influenza epidemic, which raged all over Nejoi including Eiyadh, Bin Sa'ud himself having lost two sons among other relations. It was hard to leave this cool and nice little spot so soon, but ^e started at 4-30 p. m . though I was feeling extremely tired and every inch of the body was paining like a sore, after five days' and nights' marching—ordinarily Sha'arah is reached on 8th or 9th day after leaving Riyadh 114). Passed under another little cluster of 'Ithl ' ( ?) trees w r ith date- palms to the south-west of the town Two Baduof the Ar-Rogah tribe have at last joined us from the Badu camp here for Hajj. Ahmad Thanaiyan says these will be better guides than our old ones—Sagnr and Aayidh. 115. The route lies south south -west, instead of due west, so far. Camped in a stony little valley at 12 -30 a. m and Lad hardly laid dow n in bed when a very strong hurricane blew from the north. Dust and small stones were blown into everything, and the only remedy was covering with a blanket and lying down behindshidads ' or camels was employed, TVrrible sounds w r ere produced by the force of wind, passing through the hills around, and even the camels got frightened and started an uproar in the pitch dark night. In about half an hour every thing was quiet; again and sleep reigned. 116 Friday, 13lh Angust=27th Bhil Qa'adah. Started at 4 a. m. route lies over sandy ground with black roeks all around. At 9 a. %i. came out on a big sandy Wadi or plain with plenty of Asb^b grass and many ''Sumr' (kiKar) trees surrounded by black hills. At 11-30 a. m . halted in a level sandy plain called MasluJch or Uashib. Here there are four walls (a fifth half ruined or gutted) around which are several parties of Ar-Rogah (Ataibah) Badu men and women w ith some hundreds of camels and half a dozen large flocks of sheep and goats. The principal camp is stated to be behind the nearest hill to the south. Their Shaikhs are Bin Tba'ali and Faihan. The Ar-Rogah were, till lately, counted among the Hejaz tribes but have been freshly gained over by Akhwanism. They are stalwart and comparatively fairer than the other Bedouins we have met so far. ( Their women are equally hardy, and many are drawing water mixed up with men'while others are running about managing their camels and sheep for ' warud ' taking to water in proper order. They 1131 f&amp;pd wdid not cover their faces at all and stood looking at us as we passed by to our campin^-sround, about 4U0 yards west of tbe 'wells. ^ ater, found at a depth of about 25 feet, is plentiful, light and sweet, but rather muddy. 117. Started at 3-30 p m as the brief interval of rest so much needed had to be still further curtailed owing to the Amir of Sha'arah's story that Mecca was 11 days instead of 8 days' journey, as we thought. Route lies over stony bed of a Wadi, winding between hisih rocks. Just before sunset came out cn a vast plain of good hard soil v\ith lots of 14 Ashab ' and other grass. At 7 p.m. halted for prayers and tea, and resumed march at 8-30 p. M., camping at 1-30 a. m . in a sandy plain near hills called Nir-as-Saghir. Good, cool gharbi' (west) wind is blowing and the pitch dark night is, at intervals, relieved by lightning flashes seen for away to the south and south-west. 118. Saturday, 14th August—ZSth Dhil Qaadah. Started at 4-30 A. v. The road, a well-marked track, now passes over rocky ground, and then down into small valleys in succession, till at 8 a. m. wp come out on abig^ sandy plain, with high hills at a distance all around. We have just left llaDabij to our right (north) about ten miles. It is now quite clear to me that our guides are always taking the shortest route and leave out towns and villages, in orJer to save time, and also to avoid the worry of more people trying to join the party which would be an encumbrance. Ahmad Thanaiyan says that the u^ual big Hajj-caravan or a big Ghazu cannot go by this, our route but iollows the route indicated by the map, as that route alone has as much water as can nearly suffice for the demands of men and camels. It is usual for Nejd rims to assemble at Asheirah coming by different routes, and Koweit Hajis join those at Qassim and then go under Bin Sa'ud's flag; the number is some times forty thousand or thereabouts. 119. At 9 a. m . passed by a camp of Albargah Badu a section of the Ataibah, lying in a low valley in about 40 ' Bu^-ut Sha'ar ' (tents), about 300 camels and perhaps one thousand or twelve hundred sheep and goats grazing around. Their Shaikh is a Bin Hindi. 120. At 11 a.m . halted in a sandy nlain with good pasture for camels Lunched and slept as the wind 'gharbi' (west) still blowing; is less hot than last few days. Probably rain has fallen in the distant hills towards the Hejaz (west). Gave medicine to three men, Fahaid, Bin Nassar ami Marid. Former had toothache and the others diarrhea. All cured at once. Started at 4 P.Mi AVe are short of water and Saja wells are five or six hours' distant. Are trying to go faster than usual to get to water. After an eight hours' march had failed to bring us to Sa^a we encamped for the night at 12 midnight, extremely tired and much worried. Bid not get good sleep. 121. Saturday, 15th August=29th Dhil Qnadoh. Started at 4 a.m . At my suggestion Ahmad Thanaiyan has spoken sharply to the two Logah Badu guides, who now admit &lt;4 dhallaina' (we have lost our way) and promise afresh to take us to Saja in five hours. It now appears that we have been moving in a circle more than seven or eight hours and are now as far away from water as at 4 p.m . yesterday. At sunrise pass by a number of strange rocks which Icok like artificial mounds or dunes lying in a sandy plain. 122. Saja wells reached at last at 9-30 a. im . There is no permanent population here, but a large number of the Badu of the Adh-Dhibah section of the Ataibah are camping in their black tents. They have over 1,000 camels and very large flocks of sheep and goats. These are one of the recent converts to Akhwanism from the Hejaz tribes and have been driven south east chiefly by fear of the Harh Bedouins, their hereditary foes. They feel safe and secure on this side, but still grudge the ' zjkat' (5 percent on all property) which Bin Sa'ud's tax collectors are busy levying at the present moment in the Ticinity. 123. The Dhibah Badu men and women look more like ' hadhai' or town- dwellers inasmuch as they are, particularly the women are neatly dressed in long black garments, wear some ornaments and are rather fair. Many o£ them are bringing their camels sheep to water on one or other of the live w T ells situaled close together in this valley, coming over in large parties from behind the nearest bill where they have their camp. There is $ number of black;23 donkeys and four very fine mares. Water is 50 feet from tbe surface, is light and sweet but muddy. They tell us that the Sharif has sent out warning to all the tribes that Nejd-Haji party must be allowed to pass without let or hindrance. Ahrnad Tbanaiyan and his party are very glad to get this reassur ing news as they have, from time to time, more especially from Sha arah onwards, been betraying great fears of being roughly handled in the Hejaz (in due re-pajment of repeated Akhwan raids). 124 Since yesterday the heat is less and the gharbi wind has become cooler. 125. Started at 3 p.m . Route lies over stony ground with tracts of sanda at intervals, and just before sunset passed over a few miles of deep sands. At sunset saw new moon—the Haji moon—and the whole party at once started the Tahlii-o-Takbir' (to say La-ilaha-ill-Allaho-Allah-o-Akbar=there is no God but Allah, Allah is the greatest of all) aloud, in N nomewhat of a chorus of forty voices, which sounded strange in the desert and was very gratifying to me. It continued for about an hour. Stopped tor prayers and then resumed marching. 126. Halted at 1-80 a m . in a sandy plain. The night is pitch dark and cloudy and many flashes of lightning seen in south. . No wind ; rather hot ; but sheer fatigue induced sleep. 127. Monday, 16th Aujust—lst Dhil Hijjah. —Started at 4-30 a.m . after the usual hurried prayers, which do not satisfy me. Good gharbi (west) wind on, and road is over level sandy ground. Next water is at a long distance so we are very particular about our stock, and Farhan enjoins and enforces strictest economy. The whole Nejdi party continues to keep as reticent and aloof as ever, only Ahmad Thanaiyan occasionally—twice or thrice daily—comes and chats in camp or while riding along. I have always tried and turned our conversation to our mission, which I call ' his own mission He (a great disciple of Bin Saud) always talks ill of the poor Sharif, mininiizes his import ance and position and jeers at his actions ; and often finishes by saying that 'Abdul 'Aziz could take Mecca, and for the matter of that, the whole of the Hejaz, in a day if he had the least wish to do so, etc. I, on the contrary, as often speak of the importance and necessity of peace and tranquillity, of the desirability of general concord and agreement between the two Arab rulers, the friends of His I3ritannic Majesty s Government, who had expressed their great concern at the continued differences between these two friends, and had evinced a sincere desire to see peace and prrgress in Arabia; who, as a friendly and protecting power, would not like one of the friends to transgress the rights of the other ; who had, after several proposals, at last, arranged, by the consent of both, to send this present mission. I appealed to Ahmad Thanaiyan's broad- mindedness, and also pointed out the personal advantages of accomplishing the work ; that he will srain good name and credit not only with Bin Saud but also in the eyes of His Britannic Majesty's Government, etc I noticed a gradual favourable change in his views. In one of the conversations he said he was not fully and implicitly trusted by Bin Saud ; that a few years back he had been openly distrusted on account of some difference of opinion with the Imam Abdur Kahrnan (by the way, Ahmad Thanaiyan did not use the word Imam ' for Abdur Bahman in talking to me) ; that he had consequently secretly left Riyadh and gone down to Hassa, and then to Bahrein ; that a rumour was set afloat in Nejd that, he was going to claim and fight for the ruler- ship of Nejd. This was a foolish idea as he never dreamt of this position or rank, which his father, 'Abdullah, had renounced and gone over to Constanti nople. On this pretence his return to Nejd was secured by Bin Saud through the good offices of Sir Bercy Cox. Incidentally, Ahmad Tbanaiyan, expressed gratitude for the kind and considerate treatment he had received from Sir Percy Cox at Basrah. On the whole, I was now 7 satisfied that Ahmad Thanaiyan was amenable to reason and advice, and thus prepared to make matters smooth as much as possible. Anyhow, he was imbued with the spirit of toleration and conciliation instead of the intense hatred and blind opposition w ith which he came out of Riyadh. 128. Halted at ll -oO a.m . in a sandy plain situated in the midst of low hills. Strong gharbi is blowing' and it is very hot aud dusty. All food anddrink is full of dust, to say nothing of clothes and the body. Our tents were twice blown down and repitched for the little rest, if rest it could be called, before resuming what seemed a never-ending march—one of the most unplea sant afternoons indeed. Started at 8-30 p m ., going over a stony tract of land. Just as vie halted for Maghrib prayers a gale of gharbi wind' with a huge dust-storm overtook us, causing the greatest discomfoit and some fright, as some of the camels started to moan aloud. For about three-fourth of an hour nothing was visible, even if one strained his eyes and looked around. This was an embar rassing experience not easily to be forgotten. As soon as the storm subsided we finished with our prayers as usual, took coffee, and resumed the march. Camped at about midnight. Night; if cloudy and pitch dark, with numerous flashes of lightning to the west and soath-w r est. 129. Tuesday, 17t1i Angust=2nd Dhil Uijjah. —Started at 3 a.m ., and at 6 am . ascended a vast ridge called Hurrat-al-Kishab, one of a long chain of • desolate and black hills running north to south. At 7- a.m descended a large plain of white surfaced ground called Sabakha, the whole of. which is covered with hard sal ammoniac, over which the camels could move very slowly. TA e came out ol it at noon and camped on a small piece of rocky ground with very little pasture. It is too hot to allow any rest or sleep. 130. Started at 4 p.m . The route lies over good, level plain of hard, slightly sandy, soil with a chain of black hills visible at a long distance to the west and south-west. At 6-30 p m . suddenly arrived at what seemed shining white sands, but our thirsty camels, three days without water, knew better and stretched out their eager necks and began to drink. What we mistook for streaks-of white sand thus proved to be tiny little streams of rain water running' down from the distant hills in the west and south-west. These streams have just reached here though it must have rained last night when we saw heavy clouds and lightning in this direction. This was a most unexpected and extia- ordinary phenomenon, and caused great jubilation. Man and beast drank to his fill of this excellent, cool, sweet, though muddy, water. As if in thankful ness to the boon, we decided to halt, thus giving up Muwaih (the next water) for which we had given up Murran, to the, north-west. It was a very cool and pleasant night ; some of the party bathed and even washed their clothes, and it goes without saying that the nearly empty water-skins were washed and refilled. For the first time since leaving iliyadh. I had five hours' good sleep, getting up at 1-30 a. m . and resuming the march. 131. JVednesdoy, ISih Angust=3rd Dhil-Hijjah —Started at 2- p. m. in rather lighter spirits than usual. After the brief spell of loading and adjusting of ' s shidads which causes some bustle and is invariably ac companied by the loud wailing of the poor hard-worked, ill-fed, camels, the journey is continued, day after day, in an ominous silence. Few voices are ever heard, especially when travelling at night, and even in the daytime there is very little talking among this party of forty men. This is clearly due to a natural reticence which characterizes the ignorant Arab, but in part results from the orthodox Wahhabi, I should say Akhwan, hatred for strangers and non-TVahl abis. We have tried but failed to remove this barrier and have found it hopeless to fraternise with these worthies. Farhan, myself, and our three servants have all by turns joined them in their Jama'at (congregation) prayers in good iaith, both with the ordinary object of gaining merit (which is promised by God to those Moslems who pray together), as also for showing our Kejdi companions that we are Sunni Moslems like themselves. But unfor- t unately each of us has seen sour faces and heard unpleasant murmurs, which have now etlectually separated us from them. Even among themselves they do not seem to talk sufficiently or to enjoy one another's company—at any rate, X have not seen or heard any one laughing. What a poor state of things this, as compared to what one would expect to see if a similar party of any other people, Asiatics or Europeans, were out on such a journey Add to it the pi* us or, shall I say, fanatical utterance often reported to me (though not personally heard by me) ' Idah baghaita Jannah—Uqtul al Kafir washrib dammah (It you want paradise, kill the Kafir and drink of his blood) which was repeated in sharp rones while urging the camel on and was accompanied by a gesture in the direction of any of my party w ho happened to be nearest BinDagbaisar, Fabaid, Sa'ad, and Bin Saif were those especially known to long for paradise in this simple way. Less complimentry (I mean annoying) remarks were often made by our honest Nejdi companions in regard to us ; we were pointed out to strangers, Badu. etc., as ' Awadam-an-lSVara ' or ' Khuddam- al-Angrez ' (the Christians* men or servants of the English). Once, according to Farhan, the pious Bin Daghaithar replied to a questioner about us ' Hadhaula Nasara, JCuffar ' (those are Christians, infidels). Of course, the ruler him self, his lather, sons, stafl: and entourage do not entertain or ever betray any thing like this blind bigotry and fanaticism. In fact, they condemn .the Akhwan and, outwardly at least, hate and curse him for his excessive intolerance and open hatred of other Moslems; but I have no doubt that in- 'u ardly, the ruler as well as the ruling family countenance and even encourage this spirit because it provides them with a useful political weapon against their real or supposed enimies, the follwers of other religions not excluding Moslems of other denominations. Ahmad Thanaiyan Once admitted this and tried to explain it away somewhat like this : ' These poor ignorants know little of the Moslems of other persuasions and much less about those of other countries. They do not know anything except the names Christians, Jews, etc. So they cannot possibly understand the need for having friendly political relations with them. Hut this ignorance and aloofness on the part of these common people help to keep the 'Baidhat-al-Islam ' (immaculate whiteness of Islam) sale irom contamination through foreign influence, and for this reason it is not altogether undesirable. You see to what state of irreligiousness the Arabs ol other parts like Syria, the Hejaz and Iraq have been reduced, owing to free intercourse with other nations. We Ntjdis cherish and follow our own religion, the true Islam, and we had better live like thi' than seek good name by mixing too ireely with others. I could only express ray outward accept ance of this plea. 132. At 4-30 a.m . halted for prayers, re-starting at 5 am . Soon after sunrise saw two little streams of fresh rain water flowing down from black rocks called Huirat-al-Jvishab, which were reached at 7 a. m . Here, once more, the guides declare we have lost our way for ths third or fourth time which means a total loss of one precious day's march. Ahmad Thanaiyan is furious, and the guides, especially Sagar-al-Ataibi give cheeky answers. Have to turn roui d and go about three miles and then proceed on a well-marked track, travelling over dusty ground. We now see the Hadhn hills in the distance. 133. I recall one of Bin Sand's very interesting remarks : You will see Iladhn ; that is the limit of the Heiaz as the Holy Prophet has said, * Man raa lladhna faqad tanajjad. * (As soon as one sees Hadhn, he is in Nejd.) How can the Sharif claim any ground this way of Hadhn Keedies to says that this if true and abided by, will give Tarrabah and Khurmah to Bin Saud without much ado. 134. At 11-30 a. m . halted in a little sandy plain, thinly covered with Ashab and Afraj grass, a boon to the camels Maiid, the camel-boy, Bakhitand Bin Nassar avail of my medicines •,Quinine and Epsom Salts) without of course, showing the least thankfulness. 135. Started at 3-30 p. m ., after' a brief rest and the usual prayers. Pass over little tracts of small white and black stones with whicli are mixed up tiny little green and red coloured pebbles. Ground is alternately stony and sandy. Halted at 6-30 p. m . for prayers, also took coffee, and resumed the march. The camels, though much spent, seem to go pretty fast, not less than five mile an hour 1 should think. Halted at 11 -30 p. m. ]S t o supper as usual. I content myself with biscuits which I share with Farhan and Ahmad Thanaiyan. Had a good sleep in spite of the fears betrayed by the party who seemed to expect a sudden raid or onslaught. This was to my mind a sure sign that we were then in the Hejaz territory. 136. Thursday, 19th August = 4th Dhil-Eijjah. Started at 4- a. m., going over stony ground with many shrubs all around. At sunrise we found ourselves in a vast jungle of Sumr and Khumt, very prickly stunted trees, which were rather difficult to pass by, without getting one's clothes and bags torn. 1131 f&amp;pd1S7. At 7-30 a.m . we halted for coffee. Here my ' mahmil T ' (riding box) had to be given up, as it had, by now, been reduced to a perfect wreck. T was not a little'disturbed in mind at the prospect of open riding under the Ileiaz sun, but felt some cocsolation on remeLnbering God's warning '* Wa ma antun be balighihe ilia be shaqqil anfas ' [you are not going to achieve it (the , .Hajj) except alter the severest bodily trials]. 138. Here Ahmad Thanaiyan and myself wrote letters to King Hussein and Captain Ajab Khan, respectively, informing them of our approach and requesting that we may be provided with the necessary escort at Asheirah, Sagaral-Ataihh was entrusted with the taslcol' taking the letters, and sent ahead on the best ' Omaniyah ' (camei) we had. 139. The famous 4 Ain-Zubaidah, lam told, passes from near here to Mecca. This is the underground caual from Iraq which Zuhaidah, the wile of Harun-al -Rashid, built for taking the water of the Tigris to Holy Mecca which was in those times suffering for want of water. The story goes that this great princess was longing to perpetuate her memory by means of some groat deed, and this colossal work of cliarity was revealed to her in a dream, and she lavished untold wealth in its accomplishment. 140. An early halt was made at 10 a. m ., as the heat wa 1 ? almost un bearable. The light tents, we have, give only a nominal shelter,. CanixOt sleep at noon in rpite .of extreme fatigue. 141. At 3-30 p.m ., started again. TTe now see fto south-south-east) the black Zala-Tarabah, which is one of the chain of hills called Iladhn. The town of Tarabah is under one, tha highest of those rocks and is commanded by it. Dahaim declares that a gan like one of those possessed by the Imam can hit the town from the top of the zala (lit. a rib). Koute (a slight track) now lies over good level hard ground slightly sandy at times. 142. Halted at 6-30 p.m . for prayers, also took coffee and resumed the march at 7-30 p.m ., and fit 8 o'clock were overtaken by a very strong gale nf gharbi (west) wind which soon compelled us to stop and make our camels sit. Pearful noise, dust and pitch dark prevailed for an hour or so, after which we started again, halting at about midnight. Slight east wind, rather cool and damp. Slept well. The plain is called Helemab. 113. Friday, 20th August=5fh Dhil Started after prayers at 4-30 am. Ground is rather wet as there has been some rain. The route oVer hard ground full of shrubs and numerous ' sumr ' (kilvar) and khamt trees, which hamper the march and ofien tear our clothes and khurjins. Soon after sunrise are sighted the black rocks Al-Harrrh in front of us (west and south-west). 141. At 9 a.m ., arrive at (what later proved to be) Al-Muhdith well?. Here there are thirteen wells built of c ood black stone, very narrow and deep. Water is at a depth of about 50 feet from the ground. Several of these are nearly dry and only live or six central ones have gocd water. There is a small jungle of all bright green ' talha ' trees ar mnd the wells reaching up to the nearest rock about 30 ) yards to the nodh; and looking rather picturesque. Salman Bin Isa, the eldest son of Shaikh Isa, the ruler of Bahrein, died here, about 20 years ago, when returning after the Hajj, There is no sign of his grave to be seen now, though one must have been made at the time. ' Not a stone to toll where I lie.' Some of the party mistook this place for ' Asheriah but Bin Khalaf, who had been to Mecca many years ago, declared that it was anything but Asheirah. Neither he nor any one else could tell where we were and many said ' dhallaira ' (we have lost our way). Alter watering the camels and filling our skins we started again at 11-30 a-M ., going very slow in the hope of being met by the Sharifian escort. The route goes winding through the sandy bed of a shuaib ' (river) with numerous large ' sumr trees ai d other shrubs and high rucks stretching as far as the eye could see. 145 It was not thought safe to go on without an escort and a halt was made at 12-30 p.m . F ah aid Bin Na&gt;sar and Abdul Hadi were sent out to watch on three of the nearest hillocks. Camels were not left to graze, nor. fully un-loaded, but were simply tied up. Those who went round collectingfirewood carried their rifles, ready for an emergency. None caine and the pickets were called and the march resumed at 2-30 p .m , after a hurried lunch. 146. As we were going along slowly and cautiously, three men were sighted about a mile ahead of us riding on camels and coming in our direc tion. A halt was ordered and there was a suspense till the men came up slowly. These proved to be the escort so anxiously awaited. They gave us their names as Awaz-al-Asmi, Jabir Ar-Rogi and Said-Ar-Rogi. Their party of 30 men had been ordered the previous night by telephone and started Irom Taif from three different routes ' to mee^ Bin Sa'ud's 3 ama ' a ^ or men . They were puzzled to see our small parly, and wondered if it was not a different party and an Akhwan ' Ghazu I - J j T . Took coffee and started again. Asheirah ^ left about four miles to our ri^ht (north). There is no permanent population there, I am told, but only temporary Badu camps of Ar-Rogah, Al-Hadhil and others. 148. The route goes winding round hills. At 4 p.m ., we reached a small valley lying under high hills and a party of some ten or twelve Badu were seen on the tdp of one of these about 800 yards away. They fired ten shots in our direction and as others were joining them by twos and tbrCes from behind the hills, about thirty shots more were fired at intervals from this and two other rocks. Fortunately, no one was hit, although a few shots passed just over our heads. We stepped at once, made our camels sit and sat behind them while one of the escort ran up, explained matters and brought off two of the Badu with him. They were Mugatta (Ataibah) Badu, whose Shaikh is Shallah bin Shailyan. The shots they said, were fired only by way of ' ta'aruf (mtroductioni. Tney had Martini rifles and looked like robbers and cut throats in sp?te of their poor physique and rugged appearance. 119. We proceeded going up hill and at 5-30 p.m ., began to descend into the Mudhiq, a narrow rugged and steep pass with high hills on both sides. Had to go very slowly and cautiously as the road was very steep and stony till at last we came out at 7-30 p.m ., on a large river-bed, and then ascended some rocks reaching Aiaghasil (Sail) at 9-30 p. m . Here we were met by one Sharif Sulaiman Al-Jaudah and three others who had beea sent by King Hussein, and camped for the night. Extremely tired but happy to have reached within one day of Holy Mecca. 150. Saturday, the 21st Aiigust~6th Dhll Hijjah. Rise at 4 a.m., and as this is our ' Miqat-al-Hajj ' (place from where the ritual and observance of pilgrimage begin) we all take the necessary bath and put on the tbran. (dress which consists of two sheets of white cloth,'one being tied round the loins and the other thrown over the shoulders. The head must not be covered at all). 151. Staited at 6 a.m ., every one repeating aloud the necessarv ' Talbiyah ' (Labbaik-a Allahuma Labbaik, i.e. Here I am, O Lord ! Here I am, present before Thee) which has to be uttered as often as possible, and always aloud, till the Holy Ka'abah is reached. . . \ 152. At 12 noon arrived at Zemah, a small village in a beautiful little valley with good date-palms and other trees. There are about 50 mud houses of various Arabs, mostly farmers and a very plentiful supply of water from a natural spring. The water comes down from a high rock in the shape or a little waterfall and is collected in a reservoir about 40 feet square. Several little canals are made for irrigation purposes. Here we were received by Sharif Musaid bin Abdul Mohsin, who was sent by King Hussam with a letter of welcome to Ahmad Thanaiyan (in reply to his, sent irom near, Asheirah) with a party of five others, all on horseback. 153. Stopped in a hut in one of the gardens. The shade (the only kind allowed in ' ehram ') is a great relief after marching bare-headed six hours under the Hejaz sun. 154. Two goats wore supplied by Sharif Musaid (on the King s behalf) for lunch and the whole party including the Sharifian escort, lunched toget er. 155. At 4 p.m ., started for Mecca. The road is now a good broad high-way winding through hills and very undulating. It is the Mecca-Tail28 road, and there is a heavy traffic, large caravans of camels going laden mostly with dried hay, firewood aod charcoal, are going to Mecca and others returning. 156. At 6-30 p.m . stopped for prayers, resuming the march at 7 p.m., and arriving at Wadi-al-'Alam at 9-0 p.m . Halted for the night just under Jahal Nur, a high hill on which there is a spring of water and a small tower commemorating an event of the holy prophet's life, when persecuted by the callous unbelieving Quraish, he was forced to fly from Mecca and take refuge on this hill, before his eventual departure, the Hijrah (migration), to Medina. 157. As was necessary according to precept, we soon started off on our camels leaving kit and servants here, for the ' Tawaf-al-Qudum ', first entry '» into the harem of Jxa'abah and reached there at 11 p.m ., returning to camp at about 1 a.m ., atter performing the ceremonies of ' Tawaf *' and ' Sai ' walking round the holy mosque of Ibrahim and between the ' Safa ' ani ' Marwa and then performing ' Taqsir ' cutting the hair—all old relics of the times of the Prophet Ibrahim. 158. Sunday, 22nd August—7th Dhil Qciadah. —At sunrise shaikh Ibrahim A1 Moatiq, a Nejdi (he is a refugee flying from Bin S'aud is a favourite of King Eussain's and a great sycophant and hypocrite) came out.^to our camp with a dozen men, and welcomed us on the King's behalf, saying that His Majesty and his sons were ready to receive us at the ' Qasr ' palace where he would convey us. We started after taking coffee and tea and at 8 a.m . entered the Holy City which now seen in daylight appears to be very large and well-built, with beautiful pucca houses having mostly two to four stories, with big broad streets and bazaars all full and bustling svith people of all lands. One cannot have an idea of the cosmopolitan character of this city without seeing it during this the Hajj season, though, of course, it has a permanent population of multifarious peoples of Asia and Africa.

Sharif Abdullah sent with our party one Mudhi Al Akur of the Hazail tribe, also one Khalaiwi bin Fahran of Jazmah to act as escort as far as Ashairah. Abdullah's intention was that this escort should proceed to Turabah and see that Ahmad Bin Thanaiyan gave warning to the Bin Luwai tribe.h 'I H i 29 % m also to the border Akliwan, not to the raid Hejai territory (as promised).

(2) It will be noticed that the return journey of the mission was by a slightly different route to that taken on the outward or westward, journey a month earlier, and, whereas the journey from Eiyadh to Mecca was done in the remarkable time of 15 days (see Khan Sahib Syed Siddiq Hasan's report), the return journey of the same distance was covered in 23 days B List of Shaikhs of Ataibah, Bugum, Sabia, etc., who have deserted the Hejaz for Nejd. (See appendix A. F.) C List of Al-Murrah Shaikhs and names of Sections of the tribe. (See appendix G,) D Geneeal Observations oe Individuals and Politics in Mecca. (1) King Hvssain. — Short, thick-set, well -covered, very white face, lool\S about 65 years of age. Wears a turban and long jubbah. Courteous on fiist receiving members of mission. Soon, however, showed his real nature. A man of violent and uncontrollable temper. Rages against Bin Sa^ud at all times and seasons w ith the rage of a weak, neurasthenic old man. Just before we, the Nejd Mission, were taken into King Hussain's presence, the Sharif 'Abdullah made apology on his behalf saying : ' I pray you make every allowance and don't contradict the old man (al-shaib) ; you N^ill find him quite impossible with a 'head of wood ', 'rasu mithl al khashab.' ' To my mind King Hussain is violently anti-English, though I know Syed Siddiq Hasan does not quite agree with me. {tefore people, and especially before the members of the mission, the King pretended that the British Government were his friends and supporters, but in private nothing is too bad for them. He continually denounced the English for their deceit and double dealing; especially did he show bitterness over Sir Henry MacMahon's so- y called premises to him. King Hussein in one of his outbursts held out his arm and bared his wrist and said : 44 The English have encircled Arabia with a band of steel just as a bracelet would encircle my arm He gripped his left wrist with his right band to bring home his simile. In my opinion King Hussein certainly deeply engaged in a wide propaganda to put Moslems generally against the English and Europeans. This bears out what Bin Sa'ud told me in Riyadh later and, which 1 believe he has long been trying to explain to His Majesty's Government. King Hussein's opinions of Sir Percy Gox are the reverse of friendly while he makes no seeret of his hatred of' the very name of Philby. He firmly re fused to believe that Sir Percy Cox was* returning to Mesopotamia. ' If he tries to do so I, Hussein, will prevent him ', he said (Ana ma akhalli) ' Minhu hal Coxus Mocus wa hai Philby Milby ', he burst out in wrath on several occa-» sions : ' Both are the greatest entmies of the Arab race Again a^ d again he accused His Majesty's Government of sowing discord among the Arab peoples. 'If it were not for the English ', fie said, u I, Eussein, should now be ruler of all Arab-speaking racts. It was England's way, however, to first make use of me, and then to throw me over ensuring that a ui'ed Arab nation was an impossibility '. ' Who was Bin Sa'ud but a petty Amir who had set himself up with English gold.'* (This was, said not in Ahmad bin Thanaiyan's presence). ' Bin Sa'ud used to receive £3,000 per month from me. Because 1 stopped it, Bin Sa'ud has started all this trouble. If I gave it Mm again, he would lick my sandals.' Tftis arrl Tuch more in the same strain was the fype of conversation I was regaled w ith. 1 had several private talks with King Hussein I might mention.31 Summing up, I think King Hussein to be a regular old fool, without the the ' Siyasi ' of a flee (barghooth) entirely unfit for his position, and a pitiful example of one who might have been great, working entirely against the in terests of Arabs in general. Unfit for his position, it were better for every one if he were dead. Far better if he were deposed and the late Sharif Aii of Mocoa, now in Egypt, were placed on the throne instead. From what I could gather from influential-people it would appear that King Hussein is most unpopular in Mecca. The Kalid-dar of the great mosque was most emphatic in this. He, of course, was prejudiced having recently had his pay reduced. Others, however, were of the same opinion. The dungeon of King Hussein called ' Gabboo ' was described to me at length whilst we w r ere in Mecca It appears to be a cruel and disgusting method of putting criminals to death. Mecca is full of Effendis (ex-Turkish officials). There is no doubt what soever that as long as such rascals are employed by the Sharif he will never be able to put his house in order. (2) Sharif AH is a faqir*' not a man. Has no push or energy. A person altogether of most unprepossessing appearance. Tall, thin, with a small head like that of a bird, he has nothing to say for himself. He has almost as bad a temper as his father when he breaks out. Ali holds the title of Governor of Medina. As assistants he has one Shahadth and Sharif bin Mansur. Ali remained in Mecca during our stay there. (3) (SAarj/is ador.key (hamar) who does nothing but eat and drink and sleep. He docs not even dine among men nor does he know the meaning of a Shaikh's ' Mejlis ' or ' Mudheef '. ' He sups regularly alone with his mcther ', and lhat describes him better than anything I can tell you. For the rest, Sharif 'Abdullah is good-looking, and well-built, but entirely lazy. When asked by me in joke when he was coming to be king over us in Iraq, 'Abdullah raised his hands with a gesture of horror and said : ' Do you suppose 1 shall ever dream of accepting any one's invitation to go and rule over your madmen who are all 4 Nifaq '? Never while I live, I am much more comfortable in Mecca 'Abdullah's one topic of conversation is politics, though he seems to know precious little of what is happening in the world. Certainly in matters con^ oerning Iraq, he is pathetically ignorant. (4) Sharif Shakir is a fine upstandinsr man. He clams to be a Bedouin and lives in Bedouin style. T\ ears a ' kafiyah ' and ^agal', in contradis* tinction to King Hussein, 'Abdullah and Ali, who all wear turbans or ' ammamahs '. Shakir, however, is no more a Bedouin than you are (meaning Major Dickson), hti is a Hadhri, pure and simple, but loves to pose—he thinks it grand. (5) Ahmad Sanojee is Wazir al-Maliyah (Financial Secretary). (6) The Chief Qnzi of Mecca is one 'Abdullah As-Siraj. (7) The city of Mecca is hot and unhealthy, much fever being about. Police arrangement^ in the town are good. Outside, Bedouins do as they - please. E Latest Nbjd News. Notes on the Akhwan, etc. (1) Operations in Assir. —I met Hasan bin Ayadh with bis brother Mohammad; Hasan is ex-ruler of Assir. Both brothers are being kept in Riyadh by the Imam Bin Sa'ud as political prisoners. Hassan has just been allowed to marry a Riyadh lady, the daughter of one Battal-al-Nathlul. It would seem from this that Bin Sa'ud definitely intends adding Assir to his territories. I heard in Riyadh Bin Sa'ud appointed officials and' Amirs in Assir from the local inhabitants. This had caused great satisfaction. (2) Ataihah news. —As mentioned previously, Shallal Bin Shalliyam, chief of the Al-Muggattah section of the Uejaz Ataibah endeavoured to cause trouble32 fo the mission, both going into and coming out of the Hejaz u.. is at present camped in the hills near 'Ashairab. His men fired at the on both occasions, happily without inflicting casualties The Uo principal Shaikhs to-day of the Ataibah are Abdar Rahman bin Bahain and Sultan bin Eumaid. Their word is law. Both are regarded as famous men in war, and are staunch supporters of Bin Sa'ud. B^th haye joined the Akhwan. Bin Tha'ali who is one of the Shaikhs of the Eogah section of the Ataibah who recently came over to Bin Sa'ud from Hejaz was, till last year, serving under Sharif Eaisal in Syria. He has now become &lt;s Mudaiyan' (Akhwan). The Imam has given him a house in Riyadh and has favoured him with many gifts^ His latest honour is a ' bairag ' or flag given him by Bin Sa'ud who has appointed him official collector of zikat from all sections of the great Ataibah tribe residing in the Hejaz (under King Hussein). Bin Thaali's property called Kakhal-al-Mabani lies between Mecca and Medina. He has, of course, had to give this up. (3) Hiyadh personalities.—SsXzh. Bin Adil of Riyadh, a native of Areth is to-day in charge of collection of all zikat from the Bedouins of Neid proper exclusive of Ataibah. * ^ In Hassa th\s work devolves on Abdur Rahman Bin Ma'amir, at present acting Amir of Jubail. (4) Bin Jabir of Riyadh is another person of great importance to-day. He is one of the Imam's trusted generals. It was he who recently led, 2,000 Akh^ an against the Harb tribe and captured Satainah and Suwairiyeh on the Mecca-Medina road. This, at the time, was duly reported by King Hussein. (^) Kowelt news. 'W hile in Riyadh I heard that I'aisal Ad-Dawish with a large torce of Akhwan had attacked Jarah, near Koweit, where Bin Tuwala of the Shammar was camped. Faisal captured all the camels together with 100 camels of Hilal Al-Mutair, an important merchant of Koweit. These latter will doubtless be returned as Hilal is in secret one of Bin Sa'ud's supporters. Feeling against Bin Tuwala was very hitter in Riyadh. He was accused of bein^ the cause of tbe whole Koweit trouble. (0) 'Abchil Aziz Al'Musa'ad and Jbn Ahfaisan are still in Ibha (Assir) and are in constant communication with Bin iSa'ud. {!) IIassa news—Ihv Jarfan of the Ajman, has been bribed over by Ibn Subah of Koweit to join him. Bin Sa'ud has consequently ordered all the Nejd and liassa tribes to bave no dealings with the Ajman unless they become Akhwan and settle down in buildings. (8) Sultan bin Humaid, the great leader of the Ataibah,-look part in the Jarah affair. He is now at Ghat-ghat, the head Quarters of the Atatbah Akhwan. (9) Zikat. The Imam to-day levies ' zikat' from all the Badia tribes at the rate of one rial per forty rials (2 J per cent). 'If any one tries to hide' part ot his property in order to escape from zikat, he is declared to be a 'kaflr' (apostate) and as soon as such concealment becomes known the whole of such property becomes liable to confiscation as it is a crime against the ' Bait-Al- Mal ' (Public treasury) to conceal property and evade payment of 'zikat'. The ' zikat ' on camels is taken at the rate of fifteen rials per five camels and on goat and sheep at one per forty, 2^ per cent. (10) Dcwasii' news. Shortly before I returned from Mecca some trouble' arose among the inhabitants of the Wadi Dowasir and a certain Khalil waa reported to have been beaten in a ftosque, while another man was killed. As a result the Imam sent down his slave Mutrif who arrested and brought the following leaders to Riyadh Shiyaa Al Kharom of the Al-Bu Sabba r a. . Zumam bin Quwaiyid of the Abu Al-Hasan. Shaiban. •- Turki bin Shiyaa. ' Saad bin Dharman, f-v /« , 33 All the above are notables of the Wadi Dowasir and are now still detained in Riyadh. As will be seen later in this report I believe they were executed but 1 cannot be quite certain. (11) I) ha fir news. —Sarghas wa 1 ad Hamud Bin Suwait of Hajrah, Iraq, recently brought a present of a 'shagrah' (mare) to the Imam. He has four other men of the Dhafir tribe with him. They are now guests of Bin Shalhub, Bin Saud's right-hand man. (12) News of Nejd. —Farhad Bin Ma'amar, Amir of Qasim, has taken a ' Ghazu' against Bin RashitTs men. This was in October last. (13) Return of Bin Saud from visiting Sir Fercy Cox. —On his return to Riyadh irom his Ojair visit the Imam held a great Darbar after the Juma'ah prayers. There was a very large gathering and about 300 Akhwan were present in the big audience-hall. The Imam delivered an oration starting with the quotation from the Quran ' Ati-ul-lah wa Rasuluh' etc. (Obey God, the Prophet and your rulers) adding that he who disobeys the ruler becomes a a Kafir (apostate). He then proceeded to say, ' You, O people^ of Nejd are all ignorant of religion. We went up against you and Bin Rashid in support of God's word (Islam) and God heightened and glorified His word, the true religion, and granted us victory over all ' munafiqs' (hypocrites). Now every one of you has wrapped a piece Of white cloth round his head and has stood up claiming religious learning and leadership; every one claims to follow the word of God, but does so only by words not by deeds; this is purely because religion is not ripe (well-ingrained) in your hearts. Now all of you present here must change all this ; you must properly understand the matter in your minds and take a warning and convey it to those who are not present. Understand this, I say, I am placed by God to rule over you and 1 shall punish most severely any breach or disregard of my o^n orders as well as those of my Amirs. ' As he spoke towering above the heads of all,' Bin Sa'ud drew his sword and brandished it over his head, greatly overawing those present. He ceased his peroration with the words ' I have nothing more to tell you He then immediately rose and went out. The Dowasir notables, who were arrested and brought from Wadi Dowasir were also present. Just as the Imam was leaving the hall 20 armed slaves entered, seized and took them away. All the Akhwan were dumb-founded and could scarcely move out of the hall. I regarded them closely as they w r ere leav ing the palace, and remarked that they appeared thoroughly frightened and whispered to each other, 'we must getaway, we must fly'. The Dowasir Shaikhs, I feel sure, were executed. (14)/ Immediately after the events related in the last sec'ion the Imam sent for me and received me in the big MejUs (sitting room) where there were many Akhwan Shaikhs and others present. This was only a preliminary meeting in order to exchange greetings. \\ r e could not talk about aoy political matters before those sitting. In the evening the Imam sent a slave with word that he was unable to sit up that evening owing to fatigue and asked to be excused. (Next morning the Iman sent a slave to call me. I went and saw him in his 'maktab' office. He received me with great kindness and congratulat ed me on my pilgrimage. He also said that his great friend Major Dickson had been asking after my welfare and was anxious about my return. He then told me that he had met Sir Percy Cox and Mr. Philby with Major Dickson and had discussed with them Bin Subah's affairs; had explained that Bin Subah had not inherited any territory outside Koweit town ; that he Bin Saud, had nothing to do with the Anglo -Turkish agreement more especially as the Turks were now a ruined nation. He insisted he would never accept any boundaries outside Koweit. He also told me that he had spoken to Sir Percy Cox and tried to assure him that no Arab (ruler) was really friendly to the English except himself; nor could any of them be faithful to their word. No other 1131 F4PD 'rulers had such large forces as himself, nor was any of them able to defend the religion as he was doing. The British Government should consider all this and should not listen to ' aubash ' (mean fellows) and treat them as thongh they thought them 'sadiq' (truthful men). None of them were. Finally the Imam said that Sir Percy Cox had asked h:im if Shaikh Khaza'al or Syed Talib could fix the boundaries between Koweit and himself and that he Bin Sa'ud had replied that he would never accept either of those men as he knew »them of old. He said also that he had spoken to Sir Percy Cox about his own financial conditions and had been told that all would be well. The above was of course all spoken in private and in confidence. 15. Mishari brother of Sa'ad-Al-Arafah died whilst I was in Riyadh. This should interest Sir Percy Cox. 1G. Muhammad Bin Rashid, a great Akhwan A'alim who accompanied bin Masud on the expedition against Assir, died in Ihha. Bin Sa'ud was much cut up on hearing oi this learned man's death. It means a great loss to Akhwan ranks. 17. Before closing up my report I should like to add two final points for the information of higher authority. These are as follows :— (o) The Akhwan are not nearly as bad as I originally thought them, and all the ivild stories one hears of them in Iraq and Bahrein are false. Bin Sa'ud has taught them so w r ell that the English are . his friends, that whenever you ^o among them, if you only give out that you are an otEcial of the Government, you will receive a great welcome. There are fanatical fools among them, of course, but the majority are endeavouring to purify the religion, and in time Mill be cured of this foolishness and the movement will result in good in the end. (5) The Imam has the Akhwan absolutely and entirely under control. There is not th3 slightest fear they will ever get out of hand. There is no doubt of what I say. (Sd).

In winter the Murrah smerally migrate up to Hassa proper, and may be found in lar-e numbers between Qatif and Hoffuf. 3 This strange tribe is little known. They have many attributes which lead cup to suppose that they are descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of Arabia, possibly the Ilimyarites. They are great camel-owners and breeders but possess no sheep or crops. Are great, hunters, raiders and above all trackers Manv are the wonderful stories told of the tracking powers of these wild people. In appearance they are tall well built, wear lanre-bushy beards and olten wear skins in place of cotton clothing. They are well armed and used to be the terror the Hassa-Nejd trade routes before the present Bin Sa'ud put them down. They are one of the few tribes that know the dreaded ' Euba'a Al-lvhahl or great southern desert. When persued they disappear into its sands ana only emerge to raid again, whilst they drink camels' milk and eat camels meat. Their only other food are dates from Jabrin, which is entirely under their control. • J ■ At the Jabria oasis are reported to exist extensive ancient ruins No man knows when they date back to Very probably they are Himyaritic remains. A visit to Jabrin oi the lolitical Agent, Bahrein, would be well worth while. In the t ic inity of Jabrin exist vast herds of oryx. It was from there that the oryx sent Home to His Majesty the King by Bin Sa'ud were obtained. The Murrah though under Bin Sa'ud's control refuse entirely to become Akh^an. Bin fea ud takes zikat from them when they migrate durin^ the spring to Hassa. He lias found it impossible to collect tribute while at Jabrin. The tribe practices circumcision, but only undergo the operation when fully grown up, and only when about to marry. They have no A'alims and the ceremony of marriage and giving in marriage is performed by the local Shaikh and consists of the simplest of affairs resolving itself into the woman beino- publidy handed over to h^r suitor. Though ihey call themselves Moslems the Murrah are very easy-going in their religious observances. - -, i APPENDIX ' H • Zist of names those who accompanied Ahmad bin Thanaiyan and Farhan Beg Al -Rahmak from Mecca 10 Riyadh, to King Hussein.

As will be seen,Siddiq Hassan has spent,in all, f 5R l/l0/4 not an excessive amount,I thinV,considering the way he went,and the position he had to keep up as His Majesty's representative on the Uejd Mission. Of the above sum £ ?00/- is due to the Bahrain Agency * Treasury,from which an advance was taken,and £ 260/- is due to K.B.Nasib of Muscat. A further £ 2l/l0/4 is to be returned to Siddiq Hassan on account of money paid out of his private purse. I would request that the full amount £ 58l/l0/4 be sent me to BAHRAIN in gold. I can then arrange to repays the Agency Treasury,remit £ 2$0/- direct to k .B.Nasib,and settle up Siddiq Hassan's £ 2l/l0/4. This method I think will be preferable. I trust you will see your way to let me have the money as soon as possible as I know Siddiq Hassan feels uncomfortable about the large sum he has borrowed trom r.B .Nasib, especially,as the latter has started enquiring when he may expect to receive his money back.

Hamid Baghdadi, inviting me to a private meeting next . morning at 10-30 A.M. 2. I went, accordingly, on Saturday, the 28th August, accompanied by Farhan-Al-Rahmah and met Amir Abdullah in his own room in the Qasr. Ordinary conversation went on for a few minutes, then I asked him what prospect there was of starting the work for which the Nejd Mission had come to Mecca. Amir Abdullah replied that it was for that reason that he had wanted to see us, as,th© Hajj being over, it was time to set to work. He wanted to tell us certain things beforehand, in order that f we might be fore-warned and bear them in mind in the course of discussions and negotiations to follow. I thanked him very much saying I looked to him for his wise consul and sincere and useful advice which would help in smoothing matters for the \ good of all concerned. He then said that the chief thing for us to know was that we had, in the person of King Hussein, a very difficult man to deal with. His Hashimite Majesty was most kind-hearted, peace-loving and far-seeing, but, at the same time, most obstinate, excitable and un-compromising. ' r e should, therefore, be ready to excercise the greatest care and patience etc. .Amir Abdullah then said that he wanted to assure me that he ¥/as not speaking officially, nor did he hold any State office at the time. He had lately resigned the Nazarat- Kharajah (Foreign Secretary's post) owing to difficult situa tion resulting from differences between the British Agent, Ool. Vickery and King Hussein. Incidentally, he remarked that Colonel Vickery's policy had been aggressive, and on account of him a regretable 'Barudah' (coldness) had been caused between His Majesty^ Government and the King; that the Colonel had gone to England avowedly on leave, but was not likely to return tot&lt;w c 2 • 3« Ha went on to say that ha was personally anxtoua to Baa strife and blood-ahad betwaon th© inhabitants of tha Hajaz and Najd stopped onoa for all, and paaoa and tranquility rest ored. Ha himself would do all ha oould to secure that object for the good of his own motherland, Arabia, the home of Islam© If Arabs went on quarreling and fighting among themsalves, they would be weakened, and would, eventually, fall n prey to the avarice of stronger nations. Christians and others, who would then naturally rule ovar them as they liked etc. etc. 4. There i/as a pause. I complimented him on his patriot ic views and true Muslim sentiments which v/ere praiseworthy, adding that it was rather fortunate for Arabs that they had sacured the sympathy and good-will of a very great, powerful ancf^ust nation, the British, who were their neighbours and had already given ample proof of friendship and had shown so much solicitude and readiness to help and guide Arabs. Farhan sup ported me in a few appropriate 7/ords, and Amir Abdullah laugh ingly said that he afct did not want to accuse any one, but he was only remarking generally, though he could not see why Great Britain was supporting France against Arabs in Syria, while Arabs too, like the French, were their allies. There was no point in arguing tha matter, he said, and proceeded to say : 5. 'Now,about Bin Saud. He is really nothing but , Arair -i-Nejd*, as were his forefathers ^mara-an-Nejd 1 , like sever al other chiefs in Arabia. Till lately the Sharif of Mecca used, so to speak, to beat and scold him, and his forefathers before him, whenever he or they proved troublesome or refractory and i misbehaved in respect of the Hejaz in Turkish times. Abdul Aziz himself aras always in fear of Mho Sharif of Mecca, even more than he feared Bin Rashid, who has so recently inflicted a severe defeat on him. His Majesty, my father, advised by the British Government, started to give him a subsidy during th© WAR, although he rendered little or no assistance in return, but was always deceiving both the British as well as ourselves. t What we have done for the British and tha allies is known to3. tha whols world, and I n©9d not spaak. about that now. It is only about two yaars ago that the King stoDpod Bin Saud^ sub- aidy and hs got annoyad. He then got up some extra power by means of his unscrupulous ways, ohiefly by cunningly appealing to the fanatioisra of an already fanatio class, the Wahabis of Nejd who are most wild, ignorant Bedouin, incapable of under standing the true principles of Islam* No doubt Abdul Aziz is clever and possesses great powers of intrigue# He is incessant- ^8? j ly spreading his propaganda and, what we fear most, is mislead ing our own He.jaz Amirs and Sheikhs, and tribesmen to rebel against the king. Some have already become disloyal, and even our own Ibn Amm (cousin) Khalid, the Amir of KHURMA, has turn- . ad traitor# You have just bean among them and, being a Muslim yourself, can well understand that their so called 'Din* (creed) of Akhwan is an abominable 'Bidaat* (fad)# Neither th§ book of God, Al-Qurnn*, nor the 'Hadith*,(Tradition) of the Holy Prophet aver taught such things as they are doing now in the name of religion# For instance, where is the text forbidding the use of tobacco. NoOhere at all in the Quran# Then ^dJ the Akhwan brand a smoker as 'Kafir* (heretic) and kill him as — N such* I had to confess to my own sentiments of hatred for the Akhwan, and his extreme intolerenca and fanaticism# I said, quite however, that I cpuld not/see how far Bin Saud was personally responsible for or connected with the movement, adding that he had been known to have bla^med and cursad the'Akhwan at times# To this Amir Abdullah replied that that was doubtless a 'Hilah 1 (trick), and 'Siyasah 1 (policy) of Abdul Aziz, who had really invented the Akhwan to serve as a tool for his own ambitions and was using that tool with^scrudtos. 6. The Akhwan movement. Amir Abdullah said, was an un mistakable 'Fitnah* (trouble or turmoil) against which the Holy / fore- Prophet had/warned Muslims in his lifetime, as , it is stated, that once whan asked to bless NEJD, he said, 'Innaha Qarnun min qurun-ish-Shaitan, tabtadi minha-al-fitan wa tantahi elaiha' (it is a horn of the Satan^turmoils or commotions will arisem ^ 4. tharsin firat and last)# Muslims of* all lando^ mors ospsoially i thoa® of Arabia, oould not but regard that movement rrith auapi oion and abhorenoe. It waa being cleverly engineered and waa apreading like wild fire, ao muoh ao that all neighbouring peoplea were troubled, and even the Hejaz, whioh had the two holieat placea of lalam in it, waa aerioualy menaced. We ahould think what the plight of milliona of Mualima in the He.jaz, ea- peoially in Mecca and Medinah would be if (God forbid) Bin Saud and hia deviliah Akhwan aucceeded in over-running the He.jaz -fk taking poaaeaaion of the two Harema of God and Hia prophet, \ which were annually viaited by many thouaanda of Mualima coming from all parta of the v/orld* ' r ould the Indian Mualima come for the Hejaz in auch an event, he aaked me. I aaid, I did not thini that many of my countryman would be able or willing to make the pilgrimage if Holy Mecca were put by Providence under Akhwan / regime# No one could bear auch intolerence aa they ahowed in religioua matters# 7. Amir Abdullah proceeded to aay that their difficulty ' did not lie ao much in Bin Saud and hia fanatic band aa in aomeltfiing elae : Bin Saud appeared to have the atrongeat sup port of the Britiah at hia back, aa hia hoatile actions against the Hejaz had been looked upon by the British Government with evident complacency or equanimity and little or nothing had been done to stop or discourage him, while King Hussein had constantly been told to do nothing and ait quiet. The reault waa ao aerioua a loaa to the Hejaz which had been ahorn of its districts of KHURMA and TARRABAH and only latterly of BISHAH, RANJAH, J5UFAINAH, SUWAIRAQJYAH and A53IR had been taken only vdtf we had been on our way to Mecca on a deputation of peace• It waa impoaaible for King Huaaein to remain quiet any longer. Something muat be done in self-defence, be it even in diaregard of Britiah advice etc* 8. I expresaed my aurpriae at hia remarka about the atti tude of Hia Britannic Majeaty'a Government, and aaid that there ought to be no miaunderatanding about that. I could aaaure himf*? p 5. that ths Grovermnant had nover supported or even countenanoed Bin Saud's hostile actions against the Hejaz, but, on the con trary, they had often 'blamed Bin Saud for the various Akhwan attacks on thefrentier of the Hejaz, and also taken him to task on more than one oooasion, notably when the Akhwan threatened TAIP, after taking TARRABAH. I added that he knew as well as I did iThat the British Government had. done and were doing muoh more to help King Hussein than they had to Bin Saud, and the mission was the latest proof of British goodwill towards King Hussein and, to a lesser extent, towards Bin Saud# 9. Amir then spoke a little about how he lost TARABAH, his force was small though well-equipped, and the vast super iority in numbers aided by a mere chance, a foolish mistake on his own part in allowing the Badu messenger of Bin Saud, who / was a brother of our guide, Sagar-al-Atawi, to come right into his camp, and then letting him return to the Akhwan, gave them the day# He said the Akhwan losses were unprecedentally great, for they were mown down by hundredo as they came blindly on under his machine-guns. He took pains to describe how he and his staff officers held up to the last moment when he was simply dragged away by 3hakir, and put on a mare, while friend and foe were mixed up, fighting indiscriminately and falling around his tent # 10• A few complimentary words were put in by me and Parhan consoled him by relating the Arab proverb 'Al-Harb Sajal*, which purports to say that fortune often varies in waV 11• Turning to his original topic. Amir Abdullah said cut that Bin Saud s gains were ill-gotten, and^such, they were sure to be lost again, one day or artother«His success and pride were due only to his cunning propaganda, to which he gave the names 'Din^ (religion) and T 'Tadaiyun w (religious awakening)• It was only an intrigue, a sham. What if he had got up some material power, his position was morally weak. He had sold himself to others, and was no longer even an independent chief, but ruled under British suzoraM^y. They had had doubts about Bin Saud's\] J ^oo oopy of treaty# k ^ j 6. position and the British att±tudo, which had been cleared by an official document. Amir Abdullah then took out the docu- rather ment he referred to. It was, I was/surprised to see, an Arabic lithographed copy oj the Treaty of 1915 with Bin Saud, which was concluded by Sir Percy Oox. He read out the paragraph stipulating that Bin Saud could not sell, gift, or otherwise give, any land within his own territories to any foreign power or foreign subject without the previous permission or consent Britannic of His SKittxM Majesty's Government, also the one which pro mises to help and protect Bin Saud against any foreign attack* He then went on to say that all that and more had been surmized % by the Hejaz Cxovernment, and ^thejr suspicions had been confirm^ ed on reading the Treaty in question, copy of which they had taken care to obtain officially. They then saw that Bin Saud had been so openly aggressive without fear, while King Hussein had been advised not to do anything. They feared that any action or counter-attacks from their own side would be active ly opposed by the British Government who had promised to help and protect Bin Saud. They also felt that Bin Saud's territor ial gains at the expense of the Hejaz meant British gains, and the independonce and integrity of the Hejaz were being threat ened. It was their duty and their firm resolve to maintain their own independance at all costs, as they had gained it by means of the'Nahdhah 1 at a great expense, and with the great est sacrifices etc. 12. I said that no one had reason to doubt British goodrwill for king Hussein, and least of all should he, Amir Abdullah, entertain such doubts. Both King Hussein and Bin Saud were friends of the British Government, who had, consequently, always tried to compose their mutual differences, and it was impossible that Government should favour Bin Saud at the ex pense of King Hussein. But Government would, in the interests of peace, endeavour to settle all outstanding disputes by means of friendly advice to both sides, and if necessary, by arbitra tion. I also pointed that the Treaty with Bin Saud did not e- adversly affect the Hejaz in any way. Amir Abdullah then said h*• 7. that they still had hop^s British friandahip and good—^111 and above all, thair justice and fair pXay; that he himself was a great admirer of the British nation, was generally known as their friend, and was even suspected to have leanings towardc the English# 13• He then said that the Hejaz had every thing to gain by British friendship and support, and her strength and inde- pendenoe would not only benefit Arabia, but England also, as England would have then a friendly Government in Arabia capable of reform and progress; while Bin Saud could not be so useful a friend to the British# His extra influence or power was only temporary; if he died the next day he would leave behind an t* ignorant and fanatic people who would struggle and fight among st themselves, only to perish or to fall undsrr foreign yoke,as they were absolutely incapable of any reform or progress etc® It would be best for Bin Saud himself to unite with King Hussein and work together for the common good oj. Arabia, 14# As we had been sitting nearly two hours, I hinted to close the interview by saying that I was glad to have had the honour of meeting the Amir and hoped that he would help the Mission by explaining its object to His Majesty King Hussein, and arranging for an interview between the king and the Mission, so that friendly exchange of views might take place# This he promised to do and we took leave of him# \3e00nd / lo On the morning of Sunday, the 29th August 1920, Amir /ibduxlah o«-i&lt;ll0d ms to join him a.t. th® pa.lciO0o I wont aooompanidd by Farhan Bag, and found th© /imir sitting alone in his room# 2m The first thing he said was that Ahmad Thanaiyan had ask ed for, and had had, an intorview with King Hussein, the previous evening, in which he asked the king to have all discussions in private, that is, only between the King and himself and not in my own and Farhan's presence; that the king had refused to accept that proposal and told Ahmad Thanaiyan that it was the British Government that had arranged to send the Mission with special Indian officer and that no discussions or negotiations could be carried on without British representative being present# 3. I thanked Amir Abdullah and said that what the King had decided was the bast for all concerned- Inwardly, I wondered why such a proposal was put forward by Ahmad Thanaiyan. He himself met me daily before and after that day but never said a word of that# He did not even attribute any such proposal or suggestion to King Hussein or to his sons, all of whom he managed to visit alone, more than once. I was, therefore, convinced that Ahmad Thanaiyan must have made the proposal, though I could not and cannot still understand why he did so. My only idea is that hav ing been sent to Mecca on an un-pleasant task, he wanted to sisoil it, and the easiest way to do this was to have one or two private meetings with the king, with or without his sons present,avowedly for friendly discussions and negotiations, but really for being able to give the subject matter of such meetings any colour that might# suit his own ends or to break off on some pretext^ or other© He might possibly have secret instructions to do so, because his principal. Bin Saud, himself was only with difficulty persuaded and practically sen^ the mission against his own will. 4* Amir Abdullah then said that he v/anted to give me a proof of what he said about Bin 3audgi namely, that he was constantly spoiling thoir Amirs, servants, tribes etc. He showed me a letter ( which I scrutinised and found to be Bin Saud f s) addressed to one Muhammad bin (l forget full name) who is the headman of avillage near TAIF and has the charge of King Husein^ camela: in thia Bin Saud said that he would not allow the Sharif's sons to remain in TAIF or visit it again; if they did so, he. Bin Saud, would tell his people, the Muslims (Akhwan), to attack and capture TAIF; he, addressee, should not be mislead by appearances, but should be careful to follow his own advantage; he should join Khalid, the Amir of Khurma, and take his advice and follow his instructions; the Muslims (Akhwan) were quite prepared to advance on TAIF and thought nothing of the Sharif and his sons, etc» 5# Amir Abdullah commented upon the wording of this letter which he said was very cunningly written and was a true specimftn^ of Bin Saud's subversive correspondence which poisoned many minds and incited simple and unthinking or ill-disposed Sheikhs and Amirs of the Hejaz to be disloyal to their king.. It was thus that the .unirs of KHURMA, TARABAH, BI3HAH and RANJAH had been mislead and had turned traitors to King Husein. These were, in Turkish times and thereafter, under the Hejaz and used to receive regulft*' salaries from Mecca, a fact which could be proved by documentary evidence. Similarly had many of the numerous 'Ataibah tribes been overwearied. Some of the 'Ataibah had even left their friends and property behind and gone down to Nejd; but they would one day break off with Bin Saud who could not possibly afford to give them large bribes for long, while their 'Din' (religion) and 'Tadaiyun' (religious awakening) was in itself disgusting to all Muslims. Bin \ayidh of ASSIR had just been overwhelmed by hordes of .Akhwan for no reason or fault except that he was a friend of the king who had helped him to be indepedant by driving the Turks from ASSIR which was essential as a buffer state betv/een the Hejaz and the Idrisi of YEMEN. They were waiting to see what the British Government would do to ensure peace in Arabia which couM be done only by keeping Bin Saud within his own pro-ner bounds. let him upon Perhaps Grovernment would/go on trespassing^others 1 country, as he had, by tfrelr treaty, become their protected chief, and made his own country a British protectorate or British territory, to which he was tacitly allowed to make additions at the cost of the Hejaz and other neighbouring countries. What Bin Saud gainedindirectly from out of the Hejaz territory was, thus,/gained for the British; but this oould not be suffered at any cost. King Hussein had long been fearing that i^ his forces advanced to check Bin Saud, they 7 would find themselves opposed to British forces# 6« I had to protest that I was surprised and sorry to hear such remarks from a person of high rank and great enlightefi^jpAt like the Amir t and could not believe that British policy could be so mis-understood• King Huaein being the greatest and most esteemec friend of the British Government could not reasonably entertain any such doubts or fears from their side, more especially when His JSKtiiala Britannic Majesty^ Government had actually taken steps to prevent aggressive actions of Bin Saud and had clearly shown their displeasure on more than one ocassion* It was time that both sides acted in a spirit of reconciliation and made the best use of the opportunity offered them by His Britannic Majesty^ Government, in the shape of the present mission, for settling $ their disputes in an amicable way* ?• At this juncture we were called over to the King's room at the other end of the Qasr, Amir Abdullah accompanying us, apo- logising for keeping so long before seeing His Majesty who, he A said, had desired him to come with us for 'kalam khususi' (pri vate talk) or a preliminary exchange of views. 8» We, accordingly, met King Husein in the 'Makhalwan' (private office) where we were received with much courtesy and kindness. As soon as we were seated, the King began to speak, in a rather low tone, saying that his son Abdullah had told him about our convarsation of the previous morning; that His Majesty was pleased to know that we wanted to start the work for which the Mission had come and that he prayed to God for a successful issue© I thanked His Majesty in a few words to which Farhan added a few X . more, including a prayer for his long life. 9. The King then proceeded to say that Ahmad Thanaiyan had been to see him the previous evening. Although he was not feeling quite well, yet he did not like to dis-appoint Ahmad Thanaiyan who asked for a private interview for the first time after arrival in Mecca. The King found Ahmad Thanaiyan had little to talk, but, ^ .... 4. only ask^ that friendly ■'liscuasions ancl negotiations b0 oarrisd on only botwaon himoolf and th® King and hia sons, and not in our preaanoe. The King had repliad that ho could not agroa to that proposal which, if acted upon, was not likaly to baar fruit. Ahmad Thanaiyan was obviously much dis-appointad at the King's raply, but did not prass or argue the point# 10* T said that His Majesty's answer was quite correct, and his decision was the bast for all. 11. Amir Abdullah made a faw remarks to the effect that % i/y^ there must be something^that proposal. He was interrupted by King Hussein who sail that, he could not agree to indapendant discus sions or negotiations simply because the Crovsmment had arranged to sand the Mission, and, consaquantly, their repraaentatives must be witneases to all procaadings. Ha had little trust in Bin Saud, and still less in his cousin and representative, Ahmad Tha- naiyan® It was only because of the British intervention that he had decided to meat Bin Saud, who, however, had somehow changed his mind, and,instead of coming personally, had sant an agent# He wondarad how or why such a change had bean allowed by His Britan nic Majesty's Government# Bin Saud had never shown any inclina tion to make paaoa with him, but, on the contrary, had always persuade a policy of aggression and active hostility, by which ha had already suocaaded in taking possession of so much of the Hejaz territory, and gained extra power and importance. The Kin* o himself had a^prcisad the greatest patience and waited so long to see if things were put right by His Britannic Majesty's Government in whom he had full trust# He felt as if he had neglected his duty of defending his own country and preventing Bin Saud's in roads on the holy land which it had pleased God to entrust to his care. He himself, like any other true Muslem, was most disturbed in mind at the prospect of growing religious fanaticism in Arabia, a the land of Islam. The Akhwan movement,/creation of Bin Saud's, was the most dangerous propaganda by means of which the Wahhabis of Nejd wanted to prevail upon the whole of Arabia, and violate tha Harams of God and His prophet. No Muslim could bear to think5. of t.h« dirs ooriBaquancea to islam that would follow if Bin 5aud and his Akhwan took Mecca and ?.!odina« All the world knew what atrocious acts of sacrilege were perpetrated by the Wahhabis when they had captured the holy city under FAISAL bin SAU!)« The King had his hopes in God, he looked up to Great Britain to sup port and defend him, their friend and ally. 12. I said that, please God, His Majesty^ hopes would be \ realized, and His Britannic Majesty's Government would surely restore and give all help that thay possibly could to/maintain peace in Arabia, more especially in the Hejaz, both for his own sake, and in the interests of Arabs and Islam, as Great Britain was the greatest friend of Islam. 13. The King seemed rather pleased and twice said ^Barak- Allah fik, ya ibni', a complimentary phrase he often used later to express his satisfaction and good wishes# 14. I, then, asked His Majesty when he would be pleased to give the Nejd Mission the auspicious opportunity of a friendly discussion and exchange of views, and he readily re-nlied that we could see him again with Ahmad Thanaiyan, next morning, when he would say all that he had to, and let his son3,Ali and Abdullah, oo-operate with us to decide what was best to. do. His Majesty added in a rather pathetical tone that he, an old man, was abso- lutely unable and unwilling to see strife and bloodshed among ^ Muslims, and feared most lest he might be to blame for that in any way before God, on the'Day of Judgment. 15. Amir Abdullah hinted to me, and I took His Majesty's leave with a few words of thanks, and the usual prayer c^fVhis long life. The King rose as we approached and shook hands with him, before leaving his room.THIRD MEETING Early on Monday morning, 30t]a August 1920, I called on Ahmad Thaniyan as he had had fever the previous evening. I found him 'better and brought him along £ to our quarters where we 'breakfasted and talked together. I gave him a guarded version of our last morning 1 s conversation with Amir Abdullah and King Husain and tried to impress upon his mind that the King and his sons were in correct modd and showed / much readiness to adjust m matters with Bin Saudi and said that it was up to him to try make the best of that opportunity by acting in a broad-minded way and showing a similar spirit of reconciliation. Ahmad Thaniyan betrayed some suspicion as to the object of our private meeting with the King and his son and also expressed hie doubts as to the bona-fide of their intentions etc. , but eventually assured me that he would do all he could to smooth matters. At 9 A.M. we went together to the Q.asr and were received by Amir Ali in his room. Bl-Lewa Sadiq Pasha, Attache to British Agent, Jeddali, who had come with the Mahmal, was also there. After a few minutes 1 ordinary conversation, Amir Ali took us to the King's room, where Amir Abdullah, Abdullah As-Siraj the Qazi-ul-Qazat and Sharif Chakir were summoned by the King and joined us soon. An exchange of usual enquiries after one another's health having had, while coffee went round, the King addressed Ahmad Thaniyan and said that he was very pleased to meet the Mission especially the able representative of the illustrious Amir Ibn Saud whom he had looked forv/ard to meet in person, as also the honoured representative of E.M ! s Government. There was no real enmity or ill-will between kimKief himself and Bin Saud Y /hom he regarded with the highest esteem and honour as the Head of the great and noble house of Al-Saud, the Amirs of Nejd. He himselfhimself was the descendant of the Holy Prophet whose progeny were entitled to what the Holy Quran clearly said 'La asalukum 'alaihi min ajr illa^al^mawaddata fil qlq|^^a ,1 ( quoting the Prophet's words meaning 'l do not ask you,Muslims, for any recompense for my services to you except you^love for kith and kin ) • He himself had, thus, a £ God-given claim to the love and goodwill of all I-Luslims whose servant he was# Ahmad Thaniyan assented and said Bin Saud, too, regarded A His Majesty as father and was anxious to come and kiss his hand, but time.was too short for Bin ^aud to arrange to come personalis i which he might do next Hajj season as he had not performed the pilgrimage so far and was very desirous of discharging that religious duty. I supported Ahmad Thaniyan in a few words adding that Bin Saud had expressed to me his great regret at not being able *o come ana have the tVo-fold pleasure of Hajj and meeting His Maj esty. he King then proceeded to say that he wanted to assure ' the Mission that he most regretted the existing situation and strained relations between the two sides, both being Muslims and j neighbours. Above all, he was most anxious to see strife and bioodashed among Muslims ended for good arid all. Apart from former events which were too well-known to need mention, the latest bloodshed in Sufainah and Suwairaqiyah and last of all in Assir, had very much pained him and his heart bled for poor help- lebs Arabs, the inhabitants of those places, who 'were not only his bretheren in Islam, but also his own subjects and adherents. Even t-.eir v omen ana children had been killed by the Akhwan and only God knew hoT^nany of them had perished. He was sorry to hear even of the imprisonment ofTifamir Beg As-Saadun in Iraq, \ and then how much more could his sorrow be for the hundreds of men, women and children killed in his own country. He called God ■ toto witness that he did not seek any personal gains, territorial acqtisition or self-aggrandisement. He, in his old age, could not covet any conquest or annexation, 'but only wanted rest and peace and sought the integrity of his own territory of the Kijaz. His Majesty then took up a map which lay rolled up on his table nearby and showed us Sufainah anil Ettwairaqiyah on the map, saying repeatedly and rather exci^tedly that those places were in the heart of the Hijaz, adding still more excitedly, that 1 he could not possibly consent to the'Amir'Bin Saud or any one else capturing them or any part of the Eijaz. Ahmad Thaniyan rejoined, in a slightly irritated tone, that it was not the^Imam'Ein Saud who had captured those places or any other place belonging to the Hijaz, but that it was only the usual inter-tribal fighting and capture by one Bedouin people against another which had been going on f^r ages and would go on as long as Badu existed in Arabia. This added to the King*s excitement, who, however, spoke with some restraint saying that it was no use denying facts; the Akhwan, who were none other than Bin Saud»s forces, had attacked and taken the said villages as also they had taken Assir, a dependency of the Hijaz. All those expeditions had, undoubtedly, been sent by Bin Saud for conquest and that was a direct offence and aggression against the Hijaz. i Here, again, Ahmad Thaniyan showed irritation and said, i , only rather sharply, that His Majesty was concerned/with his own territory the Hijaz and had nothing to do with Assir which was quite a separate district. What did it matter to the King if Bin Saua had made an attack on Assir / although he did so as a necessary measure in delence of his own subjects whfim Ibn *Aayidh had been persecuting, so had to be punished. Bin Saud might, similarly^, be forced to take any other defensive measures against any of the other chiefs in Arabia and would not^answerable to the King who was welcome to have his own territory the Hijaz proper. TheThe king got excited and was going to speak tut Amir Atdullah intervened at this juncture, sajinfe U.ai, perhaps t-.e .Amir' Ahmad Thaniyan meant to say that ' might was right' and that Bin Saud teing a great and powefful ruler, was free to do what he liked with his weaker neighbours. In any case, the question requiring a solution was how far the dispute hetvreen Hejd and Hijas was real and sutstantial and how much of it was due to misunderstanding or misinterpretation or things. If that could he ascertained perhaps some settlement might he arrived at that would save any further trouble to hoth sides. He, therefore, hoped that His Majesty would he pleased to allow a full and free exchange of views to be had in fnendlj discussions between 'Amir' Ahmad Thaniyan and those whom His a&amp;ajKty Majesty would appoint as his representatives in the presence of the British representative. The King ( who had recovered his temper ) calmly said that he himself was most anxious to arrive at e clear decision and was ready to welcome any settlement that would ensure rest and peace and prevent further bloodshed. He did not want anything but the integrity of his own country the Hij a z in which the districts of Tarabah, Khurmah, Bishah and Ranjah must, as of old, be included and these must be evacuated as also Ebha and Assir. All these belonged to Hijaz and had been aggressively occupied by 'Amir' Bin Saud and the Akhwan, and unless these were restored there could be no settlement or agreement- If any one present there could show that he himself had acted wrongly or enemically towards Bin Saud or any other ruler, he would humbly admit r-is own fault and would give jip avey every thing ( abdicate ) rather than be a party to strife^ and bloodshed. The Amirs of Tarabah, Khurma.aMt Bishah and Ranjah had alv/ays been appointed and ■oaid from Mecca even as late as 1918 since v/hen these places had•v. * -- had been taken poEsession of by Bin Saud» Ahmad Thaniyan was going to speak, but Amir Abdullah again intervened saying His Majesty should allow his servants $o discuss matters fully with the Mission and submit result to him, whereupon^: the King said that he desired Amirs Ali and Abdullah with the Qazi-ul-Q.azat and Sharif Shakir to do so. Sadiq Pasha was also asked to witness the proceedings. Y!e all departed from the King who stood up to shake hands with Ahmad Thaniyan, Parhan and myself saying that he would accept any thing decided upon by us for which we thanked His Majesty. 'PK,44 &lt;- FOURTH MEETING. 1. This was immediately attended by all the above, viz; Amirs Ali and Abdullah, the Qazi-ul-Q.azat and Sharif Shakir now formally repesenting the King, and Ahmad Thaniyan, myself with Farhan and Sadiq Pasha. As soon as we were seated in Amir Ali* s room, Amir Abdullah delivered a sort of presedential or opening address in which he thanked H.B.M*s Government for arranging to send the mission. Bin Saud for sending his able am and enlightened cousin as his representative with a vevy friend-, ly letter for King Kusain. He then said that His Hashimite Majesty also deserved thanks of all for so kindly receiving the mission and for expressing his keen and sincere desire to make 4 a fTrendly settlement with his illustrious neighbour the Amir already of Nejd. Both the principals had thus/given a proof of their mutual goodwill and peaceful intentions towards each other. It was then the duty of the Nejd Mission and the Hashimite Committee to try and find a final solution of the difficulties and to make a full and final settlement in order that there more might be no/cause for disagreement or dispute of any kintft whatsoever, Fo real cause existed for any ill-will or enmity. Both sides were brethren in faith and in race. The chief thing was to settle boundaries which should be respected by both sides. Evil men, mostly self-seeking ignorant Bedouins, must not be allowed to carry tales and sow seeds of discord. Such people had been playing one side against the other and milking both alternately, often changing sides for a little gain or money# Religious fanaciticism should not be encouraged in Nejd or its evil consequences would be most deplorable to Arabia and Islam. Above all, no people outside ITejd proper should be proselytised as was being done under the Akhwan movement. Free intercourse should be encouraged between ITe -'d and Ilijaz as of old and the ruling families should strengthen their mutual flrendship and goodwill by means of intermarrii-e andfell u and frequent exchange of visits etc:• 2, Ahmad Thaniyan, who seemed to 'be rather depressed on hearing this outburst of eloquence, replied briefly* He thanked 1 the Amir Abdullah for all-he said about H.M.'s Government and the Imam Abdul Aziz who loved peace and tranquility, end. hoped, with the help of God, / at a friendly settlement. He expressed his thankfulness for the kind reception, but regretted he had not been empowered to settle any boundary questions but only to come and offer Bin Saud*s friendship and goodwill to His Majesty King Husain whom Bin Saud would one day personally meet to decide such boundary disputes as had unfortunately cropped up. 3. Amir Abdullah was evidently dissatisfied with this as were also his other collegues who spoke a little, especially the Q.azi-ul-Q.asat and Sharif Shakir both of wh4m whispered together. Amir Ali ( a man of few words ) said that the Amir Ahmad Thaniyan seemed to be willing to do all except what was most necessary, that is, the settlement of the boundaries of the Hijaz and ffajd, wikxt without which there could be no hope of putting an end to existing quarrels. He hoped the Fajd Mission^ will not have come to Mecca in vain or was it that they had come only for the Hajj. 4, Amir Abdullah resumed saying that K.M f s Government had all along impressed upon King Husain that Bin Saud was ready and willing to compose the existing differnces and would personally meet the King in Mecca to do so. but it the last/ moment they were told that the Mission was sent instead. The King had waited all the time and had welcomed the opportunity for a friendly settlement. Bin Saud had, on the other hand, been interfering with Amirs and tribesmen of the Hijaa not . excluding Khalid, ^kinsman of theirs. They possessed documentary evidence to show that Khurma, Tarabah, Bishah and Ranjah were all Ami rates under Mecca from v/here the Amirs tkxrx were appointed i■ ' appointed and salary paid both in Turkish times amd jbkx since. The ! Attai'bah were all purely a Hijaz trihe and loyal subjects of the Sharif 'but they had been alternately threatened and cajoled' and proselytised and won over by Amir Abdul Aziz by means of the Akhwan. Similarly were the Eagum, the Suba^a and others being actually interfered with in the vicinity of Mecca itself. Such actions could not be tolerated any longer, especially when King Husain gave no cause or reason and was himself being constantly advised by H.M 1 s Government to maintair peaceful attitude and leave the settlement of all disputes in their hands. The so called- 'Din 11 taught by the Akhwan was not what the Holy Quran or Hadith ( traditions J inculcated but * it was a mere fanatic movement which-created most dangerous sentiments against all Muslims not to say Christians and others. Such absoulte intolerance could not be sufferred in the Hi^az in which were two Holy Places of Islam. Thousands of Muslims frajm all parts of the world representing diverse castes and creeds and nationalities came, worshipped and stayed in Mecca and Medina and King Husain was responsible for their safety etc: . 5. Ahmad Thaniyan said the Imam'Ein Saud had no evil intentions against the King or the Hijaz. The Holy Places were held in the highest respect by Abdul Aziz and the people of Najd as by all Muslims and no attack or aggressive action was ever made or contempalted against them by Bin Saud who had been wrongly blamed for late tribal raids which were very common and were due to various local causes. Bin Saud, too, had had his' \ complaints which he always submitted to H.B.M 1 s Government and was advised to wait for decision or friendly settlement. Both remove sides should clear all doubts and/misunderstandings for which # purpose the Mission was sent to Mecca. 6. I supported Ahmad Thaniyan and*pointed out that the Najd Mission had been sent with the object of a friendly exchange of views which should facilitate good understanding and amicable settlement. It was only reasonable to expect that both l* Tooth sides would make the 'best of that opportunity afforded them 'by the firendly solicitude of H.B.M* 8 Government for the ■oeace of Arabia. They should all co-opers/ce in a spirit of ^ / sincerity and hroadmindedness* The Hajd Mission was not empowered to settle the broad and difficult boundary questions which could well be left for the two principals to settle when they met in person^under the auspices of h.b.m' s Government. The representatives should, however, try and oridge the guj-f and do all they could to make final settlement as easy as possible. . , 7. Amirs Ali and Abdullah said that there was nothing else to be done except the settlement of the Hijaz frontier ^ and that peace was not possible wii^hout the XKiuaia-iiorn restoration of the districts taken by Bin Saud to King Kusain who had clearly told the Mission that he would not agree to anything short of that. They themselves saw no other solution. The Qazi -ul-qazat and the Sharif Shakir also spoke in the same strain and former asked me v/hat proposal, if any, I could make to help solve the difficulty in face of the King* s declared attitude and Ahmad Thaniyan* s refusal to go into the boundary question which was the only question to oe settled in the interests of all concerned. It was for that purpose that the Mission had been sent and welcomed. 8 # I said that they could all see that it was no use pressing the IT a J d Mission to do anything beyond its competence. They had had a friendly exchange of views in which His Majesty and his able sons had particularly professed a laud able willingness to compose the existing differnces and Amir Ahmad Thaniyan had responded with equal broadmindedncss • I hoped the sentiments of friendliness and goodwill expressed by them would go a long way to clear misunderstandings and to/ instill mutual trust. Both sides should try and forget them the past and take steps to ©'bviate any further trouble. This could best he done by agreeing to stop and forbid any kind of either hostile movement and undesirable action on the part of ray /ruler or his respective subjects. Such an agreement could certainly be expected to be a fore-runner of a full and final settlement which would ensure a luting peace between the Hijaz and Najd. 9. Sadiq Pasha and Shaikh Farhan sopke a little in support of my above proposal and then Ahmad Thaniyan said that he had already assured the King and those present in the Committee that the Imam Bin Saud was sincerely desirous of making peace with His Majesty King Husain and that he as Bin Saudis attorney would ! gladly endorse such an agreement if it pleased the King and his t i- worthy representatives the Hashimite Committee to write one in the presence of British n epreseiitatives. 10. After a little further discussion/ as to the pros and cons of the proposed step, Amir Abdullah said that he and I should draft an agreement which would then be submitted to the King by Amir Ali. 11. As it was time for lunch all of us lunched with Amir Ali ( without previous intimation ) and a very friendly conversation prevailed for an hour or so after which all departed. 'm y P I F T H M E E I IT G » 1, This was of en informal or private nature• On receiving a note from AMIR ABDULLAH I went to the Q,aEr accompanied by Farhan Al-Rahmali at 8 P .M. returning at 10 P.M. on 50th August. 2. AMIR ABLITLLAF copke a great deal about Bin Saud T s actions and intentions in/ respect of the HIJAZ and KING HIIBAIIT, much in the strain as tlready noted in detail in describing previous meetings. He also expressed his own doubts as to the gulf being successfully bridged. I confined myself to ordinary remarks, generally conveying a sense of hopefulness and encouragement for an agreement of peace, and allowed PARHA! to say as little as possible by way of discussion. Finally I said that, as far as I could,see, both sides had realised and i regretted past mistakes and shown a spirit of reconciliation. I BIT SAUD was more than willing to be on peace terms with KING HUSAI1T who had himself expressed similar desire; so there was no use in wasting time over any further discusslonc which were neither necessary nor desirable. The best thing to do was to write the agreement and sign it in good faith relying upon Providence. AKIP ALI came in ( after we had been tailing about half an hour ) With a big register. Both brothers were at great pains trying to show that their claim for KHTJRMA, TARABAH, BISHAH end 1AKJAE was rightful, and quite indisputable; one which KING HUSAIN would never give up or compromise etc: AMIR ALI said they possessed the strongest pszrikiE documentary evidence dne being that register itself. 5. This regsiter was then shown me as being the record of salaries of the Turkish Civil Administration in HIJAZ. It ran from 1527-1331 and showed among others, the names with designations and monthly salaries of the Amirs of the above &lt; fourfour districtE togetlier with their Asslstante and Clerks. The Amire kxk were not satisfied until I had examined it well arc; said that it seemed to me to te a clear record in itself. 4. Eventually, I had to say that there was no point in trying to raise the toundary question again as that could noc te settled or definitely dealt with fey the Kajd Mission. The preliminary agreement of peace and good-will was all thai Wc-vS possible and that was what had heen agreed upon in that day's formal meeting. I relied upon their good sense and hoped the agreement would 'be completed/ or a gooo opportunity will have teen thrown away and the Najd Mission will have returned without doing any good etc: . 5. Both brothers then talked a little in Turkish. PHI?. ABDULLAH turned to me and said lightly that he 'believed that i 'being a SUimi and HA1TAFI, like themselves, would not advocate EIIT SAUD 1 s cause as he was a \7AHABI Etc; i saiv i was a well- wisher anc. sympathiser of 'both sides as to ih were Muslims ^i-d ftiends of the Government I served and reprsented. After a few moment's talk in similar strain and FARHAN 1 s profuse express sions of our goodwill and sympathy for KING HUSAIIT and his worthy sons, AMIR ABDULLAH took out a skk sheet of paper and showed me his draft agreement which he /said he had written out that afterncon for me to make any additions or alterations i liked. He would then hand it over to AMIR ALI ( who had just left us saying he had a headache ) for BUbn^itting it to the KING for approval. 6. i criticised the draft as carefully as i could and with some difficulty persuaded him to make certain alterations and additions, notably;- (1). He wrote '♦Haiat-al-rWasitah-al-Britanniyah talabat' ( lit. The British Mediatory Representation or British Arbitration Axbii^rommission demanded a settlement etc; ). i altered this ( with much difficulty ) to ,, Bi Mahzar Muwafidin-al- BritanniyahBri tanniyah' { i.e. Settlement is made in the presence of ^■xitish Rep j'esentatives }• My mission was a passive one and my role that of an on-looker* It was not to arbitrate ot decide, press oi demand 'but only to assist and advice in a general way m order to let the two parties come to an understanding. (2). His ' H as r a- al - Ami r Ibn Saud' 7;as altered to 'Saadat- 9 cvl I l.n Saud'. I pointed out that the word' Amir' was not appiopriate for a ruler cf l'bn Saud* s position. I knew he resented the use of this word and often said that he had many •■Amirs' under him. I could not very well tell ABDULLAH that m: SAUL called himself a 'MALIK' ( King ) and was sometimes s.ylcd 'SULTAT' oy his own subjects, who, however, always spoke of and addressed him ae 'IMAM' ty far a suitable deeigriati. (5)« Ai; e : i: -- ciin Quwwah ^'ajdiyah Rasmiyaii au ghair- rasEiiyah' ( any hostile movement by a Najd force official, regular, or non-official, irregular ). This was changed to'any Kajd forces 1 # (4). 'Tunsab^lal-Akhwan 11 ( movements or raids by the Akhvvan ). This was orrjhitted as superfluous: the distinction ious . f Akhwan * was only ano ther name for FaJ d Wka Wahabis ■ - v.-ere included in the term used in (3). (£} .'(Jabla Mudhiye Khamsat ashur' ( 'final agreement mftst be concluded within five months' ). This was changed to'as early as possible'. Ahmad Thaniyan had spoken in that day's meeting and again told me thtt he would not sign anything speaking of Akhwan as apart from Najdis. All Najdis were Aihwan who would be bound by anything that bound Fajdie, and thai no time limit was possible for him to fix without reference to IE' SATO, except perhaps the next Hajj season, though the px o spective event of a final agreement might come off sooner. Csixth meeting . O n Tuesday 31 et August s 16th Zil Haj j Earhevia and mysel' to the Qasr at 9 A.II. by appointment made the previous evening. Ahmad Thaniyan wae found sitting alone in Amir Al^s room, which we passed and were ushered into Amir Abdullah* s room. After a few minutes Amir Abdullah, came in and said that he naa spoken to the KIHG about our previous evening^ discussion ^ anc also shown him the draft agreement. The KI1TG ha^not approved of it and wanted to speak to us privately ( without Ahmad Thuniyan being present )• ? • '•te accordingly went with Amir Ali to the KIITG who was then bidding good-bye to some Egyptian Military Officers of the M^hmal. As soon as we were seated, the King, after a particularly cordial exchange^greetings and enquiries after health, proceeded to say that he had been told by Ali about the previous evening* s private interview v;£ had^with his sons and about the agreement which I had suggested should be signed. He had already told us that he would accept any settlement that would ensure peace, provided that it did not deprive him of his real rights. He swerw in the name of God that that was his real and full intention. He had waited two years with his hands tied by British Government. Hsu Had we not been present with the MISSION, he would not have *bne * word with Ahmad Thaniyan or even Bin Saud if he had come in person. As Government had sent us to Mecca, he would speak out what he nad to say. He was surpirsed that Bin Saud had teeei been allowed * to do all that he had done, although ^ritiah Government could have stopped him by one words no force was needed. He himself was faithful and loyal to Government ever since he was advised A in the Nahdah. But if Government wanted to supplant him by Bin Saud or J if^coTild not or v /ould not restrain Bin Saud, then they had better say so and he would willingly give up 'atanazil' ( abdicate ). He could no longer put up with the wrong £ done him and the bloodshed and looting carried on by BIN SAITD in the HIJAZ and ASSIR.2. Ml C f j . % 4. 5. ASSIR. Bin Saud 1 e forces must 'be withdrawn from TARABAII, KHTJHI1AH, ASSIR and SUPAIHAH, and he must 'be confined to Najd Territory which -vvas what hie father Ahdur Rahman, hie uncle Abdullah and his grandfather Faisal originally possessed. It was common knowledge that CK'AEA, ITAF'AI SAJA with some other frontier villages were originally under Mecca and given as gift 'by SHARIF MUHALEIAD BUT ATTN to one of his dependants Ihn Rubai f an. The Turkish Government records showed unmistakahly that TARABAH, KHURT'ilA, RAITJAH and BISKAH were HIJAZ districts* He had 'been patiently waiting to see these restored to him 'by Government , s orders# Bin Baud* s character was too well-known; he had no faith and could never 'be depended upon. He had just let loose his hungry dogs of the Akhwan upon Ibn Sabah whose father had protected and sheltered Bin Eaud when homeless refugee in Koweit running for life from Ibn Rashid. But as H.B.M's Government had advised him to meet Bin Saud in person he had consented to do so, although it was most repugnant to his own mind. In deference to Governments wishes,he would himself go to any place at any time,if desired, for meeting Bin Saud under British auspices as he had no power or wish to oppose Great Britain and was most anxious to have i peace restored and bloodshed prevented. Yet Bin Saud had not come and had 'broken his promise to Government. I said that Government was most anxious to see both its great friends and powerful rulers in Arabia at peace and had for that reason arranged the Mission which was then waiting upom His Majesty. As there had been unavoidable delay in exchanging communications,it had become impossible ta for Bin Saud himself to come in time for the Ha3j,but the opportunity for a friendly tu settlement should not be lost and^proposed preliminary agreement should be signed which would be an earnest of H.M.s peaoful intentions. Therefore,King Husaain suddenly arose from his chair, iU pulled up his sleaveiand advancing to nearest wall mad© a 'Taya- K mmum ,, (the subsitute for , ablutions preparatory to prayer) and ——» m MMMH Hi ^ i and then took up a Quran from a table near by and swore most sole mnly, holding the Q,uran in his left hand and placing his right hand on to the Holy Book,saying ^ God knows I sincerely desire peace. If British Government finds me in fault or refractory let them say so and I will at once abdicate. If Government continues to let Bin Saud do what he has been doing so far without punishing him,I will resign, God is my witness ^.Then putting down the Quran on the table,he advanced towards us and kissed my turban and then kissed Parhan on the forehead, saying ' Sa^^ijK HAdhd indiyd ibni^ ( this is all I have to say,Son.) Then,to Farhan w you are an Arab-nlike myself and faithful to Great Britain as I am myself M . 5. All this looked very dramatic and we stood from begining to end without knowing what to say. The King then sat down and we followed suit. He was very much moved and looked as if he was about to shed tears. He went on to say that everything was in Government's hand. They could stop and punish Bin Saud in one day, if they liked to do so. He then said I should telegraph to Govern ment what he had said that day. The Mission must/ make a full and final settlement of all outstanding questions and the first con dition of agreement must be immediate withdrawal of Bin Saud's forces fjrom TARABAK,KHURMA,SUFENAH and ASSIR. The tribes of Mutair- al-'Alaya/Ataibah-al-klaya and Subaii,being purely Hijaz tribes, % must not be interfered with Bin Saud who must not carry on the Akhwan propaganda among or offer &gt;j|«y inducements to these or other Hijaz tribes. Failing this,there could be no peace and no agree ment at all. 6. As he was too much excited to reason with,I only said that,please God,a satisfactory solution would be arrived at. 7. The King then showed me a letter which he had received from Hassan bin Ali ibn ^Aayidh chief of Assir, shortly before that district was over-run by the Afehwan. It purported to say that the writer had formerly helped the Turks and submitted to their rule and later rose against and expelled them from Assir/ that in both cases he moved at the instance of King Hussain wl'om A he' he regarded as hiB father/ guide and protector, that he was constantly troubled and menaced by the Idrisi on one side and by Bin Saud on the other,that he looked up to King Hussain for help and would repay it in permansnt friendship and loyalty to which end he was prepared to enter into an alliariyoe with King Hubsain. The King ercpathically said that that letter shewed y clearly that Ibn ; Aayidh was his friend and ally and consequent! a he himself was bound to help him. He asked me to take a copy of that letter for Government's information and I did so ( appendix B ). There was a pause and Amir Ali who sat all the time as a qui it spectator,now asked the King if we might go over to the committed who fcfere waiting in another room. The King assented with a last word that he would like my informing Government that he was deeply in sympathy with Ibn ^ayidh as and also with Thamir Beg-as-Saad&amp;n^that he would not be happy until Government re-installed both of them in their respective places. We took leave and went over to the other room,where Ahmad Thanaiyan was sitting with Amir Abdullah,Qasi-al-QUzat and Sharif Shakir. El-ficwa Sadiq Pasha was however,absent. Amir Ali said the King had told us what the conditions of the agreement should be and as it was then rather late for enter ing into any further discussion, the committee should assEinble in the evening. All went away accordingly only Ahmad Thanaiyan and Amir Abdullah remained there. Amir Ali invited all to dinner at 9 P.M. after which work was to be attended to.' ^ 1 seventh meeting. 0o0 At 9 P.M. on ZlBt August = 16th cill including Sadiq Pasha were present. Ordinary ccrversation went on at dinner and for some tirne aftervmrds^ Amir Abdullah. ✓ then said that he had written a draft asreement and shewn me and also told Ahmad Thanaiyan what it contained,but that i had suggested certain alterations• His own draft hac no b3an shewn to the King who was not likely to approve of it much less with the alterations which i^ad been suggested by me,as those reduced the ^KHjaaKaix proposed agreemont to a promise that both sides will refrain from further hostilities till % they could settle their differences at some future date. 2, Ahmad Thanaiyan ( whom T had privately told about Abdulla* draft and my own alterarions ) said that he had already explained the object of his Mission and the extent of his authority. Bin Saud had sent him to try and remove doubts and misunderstandings,to offer Bin Saud*8 friendship and good will to King Hussain and to give an undertaking that there would be no aggression or hostilities on Bin Saud's part a provided there were none on the part, of the King* The ^boundry the dispute must necessarily await settlement till both principals , could meet in person. That could be arranged to ta'ie place at a reasonably early date, in next TT aj3 season or even earlier still• He himself would try his best to sicure that meeting, but he was unable to do anything more at the time as he had no power or authority beyond what he had 0Lfer9 ^ uo do. Amir Ali and QazU -ul-Quzat spoke a little and latter said pointedly that the whole thing came to nothing more than a temporary respite or truce during the present ilajj. There could be no real peace or friendship as long as the cause was not removed and King Hussain felt aggrieved owing to the I occupation of part of his territory. Both sides were Muslims and the tenets of Islam forbade prolongation of a quarrel etc. The I J1 The wlnole trouble was due to religious differences then why not have a big assembly of the Ulema of Hijaz and Nejd to decide and then guide the inhabitants by preaching toleration and goodwill instead of the hatred and prosecution of one another which was going on between the Hanbali of Nejd and the Sunnah of Hijaz while both really came under the same Sunni sect of Islam. Ahmad Thanaiyan made a few remarks calculated to xiift show approval and agreemen'' 9 but he obviously spoKe with his tongue in his cheek. He then talked a little with Abdullah ( further in Turkish announced that there was no need for discussion but a that next morning he and I should write a draft agreement which should then be read in a full meeting and submitted to ^ King for approval.'&gt; i eighth meeting. to On the morning o^ 1st September, i went Hi Amir Abdullah bffioe and after a brief diecussion and beating about the bush. Amir Abdullah re-wrote the former draft agreement as altered by me. His only remarks worth nothing were ( X) that while King Hussain was extremely desirous o^ a final settle-* m©nt being made within a few months,if not on that very ocoasior both Ahmad Thanaiyan and myself were going to put 31 off in definitely. That was due either to Bin Saudis own intention to ^ain time or perhaps Government would for some reason give him more rope. To this i replied that it was only due to the limit ed authority of the Nejd Mission which was not competent to settle the broad questions oi boundaries etc. the that King Hussain was only independent sovereicV 1 and his Government the only Government in Arabia recognised as such by the Foreign powers**' ^ ^ThaTbeing the ^ca8e ,Bin Saud who was always styled 'Amir Nejd',could not fitly the referred to in the proposed agreement as ^uler* or 'Government*. He had nothing like a Government, but was everything himself. With some reasoning Abdul 1 all gave up the contention and wrote 'Ruler of Wejd' and •His Excellency Imam Tbn Saud*. The rest of the work consisted of merely copying the former draft which was finished before all the others Joined us. The draft was tnen read over and,after very few remarks by Ahmad Thanaiyan and the others,passed as acceptable to all. Agiir All then took it to King Hussain who presently invited all the members to see him. As soon as all were seated,the King,who appeared to be very disappointed and Irritated, said that he had been given to understand that the Nejd Mission did not want to do more then'undertake that there would be no more advance or encroaohment upon the Hijaz till all the matters in dispute couldcould be settled at some unknown future time. :ie was quite unable to agree to that ae he had waited long to see his wrongs redressed. The Mission had oome to the holy town, oerformed the pilgrimege and was welcome to stay as long as it suited the members who were his br^ther^ and honoured guests, but no paper could be signed by way of an agree^e.i unless it contained as the first condition the immediate evacuation of the occupied Hijaz districts. The respected Amir,agent of Bin Saud, could take that as the last word the king had to say and the British representative could communicate the same to his Government. If Great Britain . wanted to see the Hijaz shorn of its frontier districts, he had only one course open to him he would resign and let Bin Saud be made King of the Hijaz as he was so powerful, had a high pedigree and possessed great abilities etc. Ahmad Thanaiyan replied that Bin Saud had not ; | and would not occupy any of the Hijaz territory which was His Majesty's own and would ever mm * remain his. Bin Saud had often declared that in his letters to the King and | to H.B.M's Government and admitted that his .wn religious beliefs prevented his ever thinking of taking over the administration of the Hijaz. As he had already explained he was powerless to sign artf paper dealing with any of the disputed places and it only remained for him to take leave of the King and return to Riyadh which he was also corapell- I ed to do owing to his own ill-health in Mecca. # The aazi -al -^uzat spoke saying it was unreasonabl . . to allow that opportunity pass without making a settlement and it was for the British representative to see thai- it , were done. He was interrupted by King Hussain who said that there was no use prolonging discussion, he /would not , accept any settlement unless it secured to him the resto ration of T ARAB AH, KHDRM.A, SUFAIM AH and ASSIR and fixed the pre-war frontier of the Hijaz as it had been since the timetim© of hie uncle and Bin Saudis grandfather Faidal. « After a few remarks of the kind already stated, Ahmad Thanaiyan arose and took leave of the King and Farhan and myself followed,returning to Amir Abdullah's room. Abdullah oame baok shortly afterwards and said that iK after we had departed he and his colleagues of the Hashi- mite Committee had begged the King to give his consent to the preliminary agreement, but they could not move His Majesty who was going to write to us what he had verbal declared that morning. It was very difficult to persuade the King as he was feeling very much aggrieved and disappointed. We left with a request to Abdullah to push the matter through if possible,or arrange for the early return of the Nejd Mission as there was nothing else to be done and members had been suffering from ill-health ever since their arrival in Mecca. The same evening I received a note from Amir Ali reminding me to coramunicate to Government Ahmad Thanaiyan's tc refusal conclude a satisfactory agreement and the King's A answer of that morning. I had fever so I could not write back,but sent Fnrhan to say that I still hoped thq draft agreement would be assented to and signed as tha^ was the only thing to do with advantage to both sides. A little later came the King's letter which oontair ed what he had said that morning, namely,that the iission must settle boundries of the Hijaz whish must be fixed at what they we ^ e fe B 2^ h V , ' ar;he mUSt 0b; ' 9Ct t0 thlS left^dlf^itety settlemant,failing which he would abdicate and let H.B.M's Government instal Bin Saud who was powerful efficient and of a noble descent, ^ Original letter attached ( Appendix J ). (6) To Baghdad only.H1HETH MEETING. 0o0 On 2nd September at 4 P.M. Amir All sent me a fair copy of the draft agreement with a note saying that King Hussain had been approached again and had,with great difficui. ty,consented to the agreement being concluded as in the copy which he then forwarded,but that it was impossible to put off the final settlement of the boundary beyond three to four months. He added a wish that I should be able to persuade Ahmad Thanaiyan to fix that time limit which was most esseni , or two slight alterations in this copy,refused to accept any time—limit and asked me to obtain the original draft passed in the last meeting. I sent a note to Amir Ali accordingly and in reply received an invitation to go to the Cias^r at 9 P .M. and discuss the so-called difference or alterations in the draft agreement. We all went to the Qasr at 9 P.M. where we were received by Amirs Ali and Abdullah. Both expressed regret at what they called unnecessary adherance to words wnile the meaningswere the same. After some discussion they gave in and Amir Abdullah handed me the origihal draft to make three copies which should be signed next morning. Ordinary converse ation went on for about an hour, in the course of wiich could easily be restored by means of frequent exchange of visits among members of the two ruling lamilies and b\ i- ur ' marriage. This last idea Uls.n had originated with the King who wanted to ask for the hand of one of the Imam^s daughter! for his youngest son Zaid. Ahmad Thanaiyan agreed that those were the best means of re -establishing friendship pmd good- will,but that a beginning should be made by allow- tial. I took it to Ahmad Thanaiyan who^ pointed out one Abdullah said that friendly relations between Nejd and Hi .jaz.Nejd and the Hijaz. ^.mir All pointed out that in view of the existing strictneBs of the AJkhwan it was impossible for him safely to come into close contact with the Ilijazi who was a great smoker. He mk wondered why the Akhwan held smoking to 'be a sin punishable with death. Both the brothers &amp; finally said that freedom of trade and carvans from and Nejd would be gladly extended after Bin Saud anfl King Hub sain had g ezohaned letters ratifying the agreement. On the morning of 3rd September I sent Farhan to Abdullah, with three copies of the agreemant which were prepared for signature and were meant,one each,for King Kussain^Bin Saud,and Government record. Farhan returned rather disappointed and told me he had been kept waiting out side for about one hour and then called in by Abdullah who received the copies very coldly glanced at them and said that he had nsoaivail very little hopethat the terms '[lakim- i-Nejd w 11 Imam Abdul Aziz' in reference to Bin Saud would be accepted by the King or the Hashimite Committee. Farhan also stated that Abdullah wanted me to go and see him that evening for some further discussion* I was, however,Unable to go^as I had fever and sent word accordingly. At 9 P.M. I received a note from Abdullah saying that he hoped I should be kixiglat all right and that the agreement would be signed next morning when all were expected to be present a^ the Q,asr at 4 O'clock (9A .M.). On 4th September Ahmad Thanaiyan and myseli' went i to the Qasr accompanied by Farhan and found Amir Abdullah, the Qazi-al -Quzat and Sharif Shakir present. Amir Ali was j absent and stated to be indisposed. Abdullah spoke a little sayingthe object of the Nejd Mission had been attained and the King had given his consent^the agreement being signed in the hope that it would be beginning of a final settlement i and lasting peace as both sideC had had an opportunity of explaining their respective claims and rights in the presenc of an officer of H .B.M.•s Government and had gained mutual confidenceconfidence, etc. He added^that the words ,t ImaI^l ,1 and w IiakHI had been objected to ^ae they had never been used before in any official paper in the Hijaz but in deference to Ahmad THanaiyan's wishes the Hashimite Committee would let these remain* Ahmad Thanaiyan and myself thanked Amir Abdullah and the Committee. A clerk was then called in and three copies of the agreement were written out and signed uy all present and also Amir All's signature obtained. Amir Abdullal then closed the business with short spoeol thanking K.3.4*6 Government,Bin Saud and the Hejd Mission,followed by an mwiu . esohange of thanks and oomplimentB among those present. Telegram of thanks were drafted by Amir Abdullah and XiiE Ahmad Thanaiyan both of whom declared that they wished send separate telegrams to Baghdad and Bahrain. After lunch I informed the British Agent,Jeddah, by telephone and later sent telegrams to Bahrain and 8 Baghdad,giving the gist of the agreement and also sent Arabic copy of the agreement to Major Batten Acting British Agent,Jeddah. Translation attached for ready reference ( Appendix 0 )•Translation of an agreement dated 20th Dhil Hajl (=4th September 1920 ) signed at Llecca by the representatives of Hie Majesty T &lt;ing Huseain and His Excellency Shaikh Sir Abdul Aziz bin TVbdun Rahman Al Faisal Al Baud G.C.I.E. IN THE NAME OF GOD,THE MERCIFUL THE COMPASSIONATE. After the praise of God. It is herein recorded that after discussion and negotiations between the Amir Aiimad bin Thanaiyan As-Saud the a£ent of His Excellency Ein Saud, in presence of his two colleagues, the respected'Syed Siddiq Hassan Khan Gahib and Farhan Beg Al Rahmaii,who are deputed by His Britar^ic Majeetyfe Government as 'Kazirs' ( delegates ) and the committee appoint ed by and on bahalf of His Hashmite Majesty for settlement of a djeputed questions, and for restoring uood^will and agreement between the two contracting parties,it is lound tnat the authority borne by the aforesaid Amir Ahmad is not full and final,such as would be required for finally and completely settling the outstanding question. Accordingly,the committee appointed by both sides has hereby 'agreed that all host ile /w and undesir^able aggressive acts shall be stoped and disconti nued and all and any actions calculated to disturb the peace sK&amp;il be refrained from by both parties,and every endeavour will be m de to re 'establish friendly relations both mo^al and material ( between the two Governments ). With a view to ■k securing that ( object ) the aforesaid Amir Ahmad bin Thanaiya has hereby agreed,in the name and on behalf of his principal His Excellency the Imam Abdul Aziz bin Saui Ruler of Nej-'i, to stop and prevent all and any aggressive movements,whatso ever, that may be directed against the territories anJ poss essions of the Hashimite Government, and likewise to stop all such hostile acts or movements, open sad or secret,t,i:a^ may t committed by or ascribed fo the ( Nejd ) tribes. And the Hashimite Committe, under the presidentship of His Highness the Amir Ali ,and the membership o p His High- noseofficial organ of th« Hijaz Oovermaent, publishes th« following official notification in its issue which reaches us to-day;- 'The Ooremment notifies to all its officials on the northern coast and the interior that oneHaazah al-Ohauth, a native of Eadinah and a member of the faaily of Saiyid Ha shim, fled the city during the Pilgria season to avoid the punishment nhich was due to hia for having taken part in the theft of the offer* ings to the Hujrat at-TShirah (? the Tomb of the Prophet ?)• The aovernment learned that he was in figypt, but, on applying for his extradition with a view to trying hia for this appalling criae, he took refuge with the officials of the French Govern- aent t and was sent to Syria. Orders are hereby given for his # arrest if possible -&gt; and it is indeed the duty of every Muslia to strive his utmost to bring him to book for having t dared to profane the Hujrat at-Tihirah, as is alleged* Ho reliable information has be'«i received here peftMpati regarding Ibn Sa'ud's Shaaaar campaign since his letter to Shaikh Ahmad, as reported in ay telegram No, 70-0, dated 23th April 1^21 but there has been a ruaour here for several days that peace has been arranged between then* Political Agent, Kuwait* Copy to Political Resident, Bushire ' » Political Agent, Bahrain*f 0 Office of the High Comroisaioner, Baghdad, 4th Jfay 1921. his excellency the high Commissioner. His Excellency lhaikh Sir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Hahman al Faisal al 3aud, G« C« I. ;« J.uler of Bejd and i3ependancie6. On the 7th of April I had the pleasure of sending ^our Kxcellency from Basrah a short telegram informing you of my return and saying that I would communicate further after reaching .Baghdad and receiving the latest news from your side through your delegate Ahmad Beg bin ihanayan. 1 now have the honour to address you again* Before leaving for Cairo I addressed to 'you three letters dated 15th February and one dated 18th February through Political A^ent, Bahrain. I trust they reached you safely. I am now able to inform you of the decision of His Majesty^ Goverru ent regarding t*o more of the questions fhich were then outstanding between us namely: Firstly the amount of financial help which the British aovernment feel able to continue to afford to you and Secondly the question of your title in the future as ruler of your territories. In regard to the first matter I am now informed that His Maje8ty 9 s Government after full discussion feel unable owing to the very stringent financial situation that exists in England ( as well as in other countries who were engaged in the late war) to accept the recommendations madein your behalf in full. The Ri^ht i onourable the Secretary of tate was most sympathotlc at the Conference and I am sure gare all the help that he possibly could but it will not be hidden froa you that the Cabinet of His Majesty 1 s Goyerniaent is obliged to consider such a matter not only by itself on its own particular merits but also in conjuntion with sereral other parallel cases and it was considered that full com pliance with our recoKanendations made in regard to yourself would have placed his Majesty^ Government in a very embarrassing position in relation to other friends, Eventually it was decided that the present subsidy of £ 50C0/» per month should be continued to you and that in case at the present Juncture you might be troubled with any temporary inconvenience a special cash gift of &amp; 20 # C00/- in addition to the subsidy for the current month should be now afforded to you. I should explain that tills friendly decision and others which are under discussion are of course contingent upon Your Excellency's faithful observance of certain preliminary stipulations which I trill specify later in this letter, but which indeed differ little from those which have always existed between yourself and my government in the past, -before leaving this subject of your finances, I think it wall to eaqplain to Your Excellency that I am authorised to assure you, that at any rate, it is not the intention of Ilia Majesty's Government to afford to His High ness the {Jherif of Mecca any greater financial assistance than they are fixing for yourself. Of that you may rest assured* The second matter is the question of your assumption of a royal title*- In this connection it gives your friend much pleasure to be the medium of intimating to you that should you see fit at the desire or with the consent of your subjectsto asBune the titl« of Sult&amp;n of Kejd and its dependencies, Hie Majesty 9 a OoTermnent will be prepared to accord their recognition of auch a title. The title which I hare cited above aeems to be the moat aultable and natural one for Your Honour to aaaiune and I think thia was your own view alao. Accordingly in regard to thia matter I shall await a further communication or announcement from yourself, Aa regards the queation of your boundaries with Koweit! Praise be to God, t. is difficulty has 'been greatly simpli fied by Ahmad bin Jaabar's accession to the Shaikhship and by his satisfactory meeting with you. The present position therefore is aa followa:- Pleaae refer to my letter of the 15th February. The territory included in the Red Circle ia what His Majeaty'a Government have definitely reoogniaed to be the undiaputed territory of ,the tihaikhdom of Kowelt and that being the caae i they count on Your xcellency 1 s acceptance of that declaion. Aa regarda the territory lying between the red and green linea on the Map it ia perhaps auperfluoua now, in view of the satisfactory understanding which has been reached between youraelf and lihaikh Ahmad bin Jaabar to pursue the question of your claims or his claims within this outer area. I should like your view^ on this point, that is to say vjhether you wish to pursue tho matter further or wish to leave it as it is. The beat plan would seem to be for you and Shaikh Ahmad bin Jaabar to come to a friendly underatanding and inform ae what solution you have reached. Two other matters which I ahould wiah to discuss are the question of this yea^s pilgrimage and the atatua of Khurma and Turabah. As regards the former I have informed His Majesty's Government that you have had considerable difficulty Insr in prohibiting your subjects from undertaking the HaJ for the past two seasons running; that you cannot see your way to do this a third time and consider it essential that those who wish to proceed this year should be allowed to do 80 # Further that while it is obyiously not possible for your subjects to moke the journey without arms for self-protection, nevertheless you are prepared to give full assurances that they shall indulge in no active aggression against the tfherif or his subjects during their passage throu^i Eejaz territory. In return for this assurance I am asking that assurances may also be taken from His Highness the Sherif that he will reciprocate the above undertakings and that your subjects will be given the same consideration as other pilgrims. I trust this will appear satisfactory and reasonable to you. Then as regards the status of Khurma and furabah, I have informed the Secretary of Ht&amp;te that in view of the difficulty at the present juncture of arranging for any .British Commission to proceed to the spot ^or deciding the status and fixing boundaries of that region, the b^st solution and one which I am sure will be accepted by your self would appear to be that His Majesty^s Government should announce that they consider Khurma and Turabah to be in a position of local independence or autonomy under a Governor chosen by themselves, and that the latter will deal with the Hejaz (iovernment ir. matters concerning Hejaa and similarly with Your Kxcellency in matters concerning your government and your tribes. I trust you will inform me of your approval of such a solution. 'i&amp;e last thing that I have to touch upon is the subject of the conditions of which His Majesty 1 s Government ask your acceptance in return for their friendly support cf your interests as above indicated. liese conditions are;— \(1) i^iat you refrain and restrain your adherents from aggressive action against the llejaa, Koweit and Iraq (ii) that you afford co-operation in thg matter of the Kaj by maintaining tho safety o^ pilgrims routes to your territory tiii; that you consent to be guided* generally by the wishes of His Majesty 1 s Government in regard to your foreign policy and to co-operate with them in promoting their policy /i.ich has for its object the maintenance of peaceful conditions in Arab countries and the promotion of the economic interests of both parties, (iv) X must explain to you confidentially that the question o the future form o^ Government and the rulership of the independent Arab State of Iraq is one shich will have to be decided within the next few months. The attitude of ills Majesty^ Gcverranent in this matter is this, Subject to the reservation that the future ruler must be one whom they regard as suitable, they desire to be guided by the wishes of the majority of the people of Iraq, They have no intention of imposing anybody upon Iraq ©.gainst the will of tho majority, iii ti is connection as you perhaps are aware there io talk re, the candidature amsng others of one of the cons of the Jherix, ^.he fo-ct is that the tJherif has been informed 1,1 ari8wer tc ) ' iE! enquiries and claima, that the attitude of the British (.overnment is as above explained and has been told that if the people of Iraq want one of his sons and if one of the aaid sons wishes to aooept the rulership, Kis Majesty's Government will not stand in hie way. But should the people of Iraq express a wish for him, one of the primary conditions which the British Uovernment required from him before they ' accepted him would be that he should undertake to come to a satisfactory understanding with yourself, an underst.nwhich His Majesty^ Uov^r^ ent would expect me to negotiate. They also ask the sane condition of Your Excellency namely that should such a contingency arise as the accession of a • son of the $ierif t to the rulership of Iraq you should be prepared to enter into a treaty of neighbourly peace with him, ■■ In-ormetl His Ilajesty's Government that I felt quite oonfldnnt you would be ready to fulfil your part in the above connection when the matter were explained to you and you were informed that if Iraq decided in favour of a son of the aherif, the policy of the British Government would be as above described. ;our friend wishes greatly that he could have had the advantage of a meetiag with you at this important juncture but it hardly seems poosible, as I cannot leave here Just now. i'ailinp; that I had hoped to send a truoted representative to lisouse these matters fully with you but that again owing to the season and the uncertainty of your own movements does not appear feasible. I have been obliged therefore to have recourse to a letter in the first instance which will be supplemented by full explanations by Ahmed Beg Thanayan. 1 very much hope that the letter will find you in th ? best of health and your affairs prospering.

July, i have the honour to inform you that, according to the Residency Agent at Sharja, there is no truth whatever in the report that Akhwan tenets have macb ^reat headway in Ajinan. 2. The Agent states that tm young men belonging to Ajman went to Nejd some time ago as students and returned from there imbued with Akhwan ideas and with exaggerated notions of Bin Saud ! s power. The Shaikh of Ajman was a good deal impressed by their talk of Bin Saud and seems to have had thoughts of joining in the Akhwan crusade. At the time of our visit in May last he was very strongly under the influence of these two men and the truculent attitude he then adopted was due largely to their advice. 3. The destruction of his towers appears to have acted like a cold-water douche,and, having to make a scapegoat of someone, the Shaikh drove out Bin Saud ! s two panegyrists directly afterwards. The Agent understood they had gone back to Nejd and stated positively that there were now no exponents of Akhwan doctrines at Ajman. 4. It was noticed that the tower which we left standing in a wrecked condition had since fallen down. A beginning has been made with the building of a new tower near by. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your .obedient Servant Commander &amp; Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf.■ • - ■ r oit 1 ^ ^v- / 61/6 Telegram R. From High Commissioner,Baghdad. To Political,Kuwait.

It is now on way out but considerable anxiety has been felt during the period as the Sultan's • Agent at Bahrain was unable to meet bills drawn on him causing loss of prestige and expense* I suggest that as an alternative that the subsidy should be drawn in rupees on the first of each month from the Eastern Bank at Bahrain by draft on London at the current market value of £ 5,000 gold. The Bank would ascertain rate of exchange and the sultan would bear remittance charges. No extra expenditure would be thrown on His Majesty's Government the difficulty of shipment and export of gold from India would be obviated and the transaction would be a direct one between the Sultan and London. From conversation with his Agent here I anticipate that the Sultan will concur in this arrangement. I strongly recommend that His Majesty's Government accord their approval and request telegraphic instructions. • .

Please refer to the Secretary of State's telegram No. 3386 of the 7th July, regarding Ihn Saudis subsidy. We have asked the High Commissioner, Baghdad, to let us know in what form of currency Ihn Saud wishes to have the equivalent of the £5000 sterling which we are to pay on behalf of the Colonial Office, and on receipt of a reply the necessary instructions will be issued for the shipment of rupees or sovereigns as desired. If, as is likely sovereigns are asked for, we propose to instruct the Deputy Controller of the Currency, Bombay, to ship such number of sovereigns the gold value of which converted at the average London price of gold during the week prior to that of shipment, together with the remittance charges converted at the offi-' cial rate for the month, would amount to about £:5000 sterling.

They are Shiahs and complain of Alrhwan oppression. It is probbble that they will request that their representations be not revealed unless we are prepared to crive protection, as they fear reprisals. Plense wire what attitude I should adopt in the event of being approached in the above sense. If such action liVely to be embarrassing for us shall I endeavour to discourage movement from maturity, but I am informed it is strongly supported. PoliticalTelegram R. 61/6 2^6 Trevor,Bushire.
