A high block of undulating tableland, forming one of the eastern huluhs of the Astarabad province. It is supported at a height of from 1,000 to1,500 feet above the plain of Gurgan by the southern spurs of the Kuh Zirkai. The plateau has a length of about 30 miles, with a width of 10 to 12. It has ample wood and water and a most fertile soil, supporting with out irrigation a population said to number 7,000 families. Its climate and scenery are magnificent. As a cantonment for any force holding the Gurgan-Atrak plain, either of Ituropean or of Persian troops (for, unless natives, the latter also suffer severely from the climate of Astaiabad), no better spot is to be found in the whole range of the Elburz.’ Its population, which perhaps bears a larger ratio to area than that of any other rural community in Persia, are a fine, hardy race, chiefly GariH Turks , they speak Turkish, as well as Persian. In this sub-division 1,500 armed men might be collected in a day. The glens leading from the Kuhsar plateau to the plain occupied by the Guklan Turkomans are inhabited by a small tribe of Turk or Baluch origin, which, from the natural strength of its country and the light hold the Persians have on the frontier, is able to maintain a certain independence. It was once found so difficult to control it from Astarabad that it was handed over to the Ilkhani of Bujnurd, who was able to reach it, if necessary. It has, however, submitted and paid the arrears of tribute due. It numbers 1,000 tents, and has a great reputation for courage, strength, and expertness with its guns.— (Napier.) Kuhsar, instead of being the blank place represented on tie map, is stud ded with villages, and its population is estimated at 1,500 families, Persians and Turks. The people look healthy and prosperous. From its mountain, position Kuhsar is comparatively secure from raids although in former days the Yamuts and Tekkes paid it more than one visit! .

Nos. 1 and 2 are quite close to one another, and No. 3 has been aban doned owing to repeated attacks by the Yamuts. Formerly the Kuhsar district used to furnish a number of footmen, but these have been done away with, and savdrs have been appointed instead, who are liable to be called to serve on the Astarabad frontier when required. Most of the people have a gun of some sort. The Kuhsar people send their flocks in the winter months to the Guklan country, paying a fixed rate for their protection. The Sangar, Naudeh, and other villages make similar arrangements with the Yamuts. The Kuhsar cattle are very fine, and Armenians constantly come to pur chase them for the garrison of Askhabad.— (MacLean.)474 KUL—KUM two and three miles respectively to the west, and after them the Knchalc.

A considerable village of from 350 to 400 houses, in the Sadam Rustak district of the province of Astarabad on the road from Ashraf to the town of Astarabad, and 16 miles from the latter place. It is situated half-a-mile north of the road in a dense forest, which extends to the shore 4 or 5 miles distant, and in which are to be seen many very fine trees, oak, sycamore, and beech. On these latter a great quantity of misletoe grows, with ' which the inhabitants feed their cattle. The village is the largest in this part of the province, and belongs to the huluk of Anahzan ; it covers a very great extent of ground, each family having its separate homestead, with barns and paddocks neatly fenced. The villagers are a haggard, ill-looking, fever-stricken set, contrasting most unfavourably with the fine-looking population of the forest villages farther east. The (ause of this difference is to be found probably in difference of position ; the western side of the province being more completely shut in between the mountains and the sea, and having probably a heavier rainfall. Moreover, it is surrounded by swampy jungle. Kurd Mahalleh has a small fort known as Mull a Kaleh, 2 miles distant, to the north of the Kara Su river.

The who ! e pass between Darrud and Guhstan or Turuqbeh is called Kutal-i-NIshapur by the Meshed people and Kutal-i-Meshed by the Mshapur people ; parts of the pass are named after the villages close by.—{Schindler.) The ridge runs north and south, and has a broad summit covered with fields of snow, across which the pass leads. The ascent from the Meshed Side is by a fairly good path, and takes one hour and five minutes from the Pain Gudar serai, which lies at the foot of a great bluff, where the defile branches to the left and right. From the summit of the ridge both the Meshed plain and city and the Mshapur plain and city, with many villages can be seen. The descent is due west by a very steep and stony pass down mto a deep and dark defile.—(.Mew;.) The journey (from Jagharq to Darrud across this pass) takes a horseman 7| hours and mules 9| hours. Start (from Jiigharq) at 6-15 a m Travel up-stream gradually ascending. Road bad, old stone serai to right at 9-45. This is marked on map as 6,910 feet.

Reach nearly level ground at 12-55 and continue till 1-25, when small bridge is crossed to the right, and Darrud is reached at 1-45 p.m. The baggage started at 6-30 a.m. and arrived at 4 p.m. —(Thngler Thomson.) “ From Jagharq to Robat-i-Pain Gudar the road follows up the bed of the Jagharq stream the whole way, and is very rough and stony and tiring for animals. The first half of the road runs through thick foliage. After that the gardens gradually give place to willows and briars, and thev too cease about the 7th mile. 7 The rohdt is reached at the 9th mile. It is a low, stone, vaulted structure at the junction of two roads, one the main road leading to Darrud and the other a path to Khur, both on the Mshapur side of the range. * The roof of the rohdt is the only level spot to pitch a tent on. The hills are bare and stony all round. From Robat-i-Pain Gudar I rode up to the summit of the pass, distant about 3 miles The first portion has a gradual ascent, but then comes a very steep pull up the side of the hill, and after an hour’s climb one lands on a ridge near a stone hut, built for the protection of travellers caught in a storm when crossmg. Another twenty minutes lands one at the summit.

The annual pro duction of wheat and barley amounts to 13,200 and 6,500 Indian maunda respectively. Good water-supply from the Lain Su {q.v.). — {Oranoffsky, 1894.) LAIN SU— A stream in north-eastern Khorasan. It rises near Mount Kara Jangir in the Kupeh Dagh range, and flows in an easterly direction down a wild ravine to the village of Lain, where it turns north-east and flows to the ruins of Sangufan, and then enters Russian territory. The three villages of Lain (Upper, Middle and Lower) are situated in the valley and are all surrounded by orchards. The Lain Su is joined from the east by the Khakistar, which has its source in the Kuh-i-Hazar Masjid, and joins the former river at the ruins of Robat-i-Khakistar. The Lain stream at Robat-i-Khakistar flows strongly, and is some 10 or 12 feet broad and 1 foot deep. Below Robat-i-Khakistar it is said that the Russians take all the water of the Lain stream which runs on to Kakhka, and that they have prohibited all cultivation in Persian territory between the robdt and the frontier. As all the land belonging to the Lain village lies below the robdt, they have now no irrigated lands whatever and have to depend on rain crops in the hills. The Lain Sii forms the boundary between Kalat and Darreh Gaz. The shortest route between Kakhka and Meshed runs down the Lain and Khakistar va\\ey—{Napier ; C. E. Yate ; Oranoffsky, 1894.)

A sub-district of tbe Nishapur district of Khorasan, about 40 miles north-east of Sabzawar and 32 miles north-west of Nishapur, celebrated for its turquoise mines. The principal place of the district is the village, Ma'dan, which consists of two villages, the Kaleh-i-Bala and the Kaleh-i-Pain, with a population of about 1,200 souls. A few smaller villages, here called Jcaldtehs, belong to the Ma’dan village, and contain about 300 inhabitants. The total population of the Ma'dan villages was, on the 1st July 1882, 1,501 (400 houses in November 1897, according to Colonel Yate). Twelve other large and several smaller villages also belong to this district. The Ma’dan village and the territory belonging to it cover about 40 square miles of ground. Most of this is situated in a wide, open valley, which has no particular name ; but Schindler names it the Maidan valley. This valley, running east and west, is bounded on the north by the turquoise moun tains,* and on the south by the Batau mountains ; on the east by some low hills separating it from the Nishapur plain, and on the west the ground falls gently to the Jaghatai-Juvain valley. The drainage of the Ma’dan valley is formed by the Kal-i-Mansura, which rarely has any water and flows nearly due west to the Jaghatai-Juvain valley. Some of the inhabitants of the Ma’dan village say that their ancestors were Jews ; others say that they came originally from Badakhshan, where they were ruby-cutters. Many of the inhabitants are Saiyids of the family of the fifth Imam ; and one of the sons of that Imam lies buried at the village of Garmab, a few miles north-west of the mines. In a genea logical tree of one of these Saiyids, written in the fourteenth century, Schindler noticed that the name of the village was formerly Pashan, chang ed later into Fishan. The turquoise mines are ra»ely mentioned in Persian history. ^ This hill is apparently composed of the same dark-coloured rock that is so common in the hills of this country; there is nothing to mark any difference between it and any other of the numerous hills about, and riding past no one would suppose that it contained mines of any sort. The turquoise mines are situated in small ravines on the face of this hill, which is about a mile to the north of the village.—(C. E. Yate.) The mines are not, as one might imagine, dotted about in large valleys some dis tance apart. These are mere ravines on the steep hillside, most of them not 100 yards across. What one sees is, first of all, two villages side by side on undulating ground at an elevation of 5,100 feet above the sea. The miners live in these. After a gradual ascent by an excellent road, for one mile, the foot of a modest hill about 1,000 feet in height is reached. The so-called valleys (ravines) are on the face of this hill, and from the first to the last, the distance, as the crow flies, is not more than half a mile. These do not include the khaki mines. One could visit every mine comfortably, ascending and descending the various ravines, in three hours — (Ringler Thomson, 1895.)The mountains of the district consist of nummulitic limestones and sand stones, lying on clay slates and enclosing immense beds of gypsum and rock- salt. The slates rise in the Batau mountains, whose peaks they form, to the absolute height of 6,400 feet—1,860 feet above the lowest part of the Ma’dan valley. The limestones rise in the Si Sar peak, 3 miles east of the Kaleh-i-Bala, to an absolute height of 5,900 feet. The stratified rocks are, on the north side of the valley, broken through by porphyries and green stones, and in consequence greatly metamorphosed, and the turquoise bearing ridges consist entirely of porphyries, greenstones, and metamor phosed lime and sandstones. This ridge rises to an absolute height of 6,655 feet. The turquoises come from veins in the metamorphosed strata, which have partly lost their original stratification, and contain minute pieces of pure silica.* The general direction of the turquoise veins is north 70° east, south 70° west, the same as that of the strike of the stratified rocks. The highest spot at which turquoises have been found lies 5,800 feet above sea-level; the lowest spot, 4,800 feet. The climate is very salubrious. The greatest heat does not exceed 82° or 83° F. The greatest cold is very seldom below 4° F. below freezing point. Wheat and barley and mulberry trees grow well at an absolute height of 5,000 to 5,300 feet. Asafoetida and fig trees, the latter bearing no fruit, grow on the mountain slopes to a height of 6,000 feet. The rain fall slightly exceeds that of the greater part of Khorasan. A strong north wind blows continually, and keeps the air very pure. Some years ago when most of the villages of the district were ravaged by the plague, and two years ago when there was an epidemic of diphtheria in the neighbourhood, the Ma’dan village remained free of sickness. The inhabitants of the Ma’dan village are entirely occupied with the obtaining, cutting, and selling of turquoises. Agriculture is thus very much neglected. Water is not plentiful, but certainly enough for the sowing of 100 to 150 kharwars of grain. As it is, only 10 to 15 kharudrs of grain are sown, and the harvest hardly ever produces more than 100 kharwdrs. The villages in the immediate neighbourhood, with the same kind of ground and soil, and almost the same climate, have many daim fields (i.e., watered by rains only). The Ma’dan village has none. Some families occupy themselves withtherearingof silkworms, and produce about 120 fb. of silk per annum. Poppy had been sown in a garden in 1881, but it was found to contain very little opium ; and the people have since then abstained from poppy cultivation. Nearly all the male inhabitants of the Ma’dan village are invet rate opium-smokers, and many women have also acquired that vice. The gain of the turquoises has made the people careless about anything else. There are, however, very few of the inhabitants who possess anything * The turquoise is not, as one might imagine, found in the exact shape one sees it when set in rings, etc. In one of the earliest stages it is a sort of soft, white chalk, which is said to have medicinal properties, and which I saw the people eating with apparent zest. Then it is seen like hard chalk, and then in veins of light and dark green and blue in the chips of rock lying around. It is found in an uneven, irregular and even jagged shape embedded in the rock or soft sandstone, and much of it is always ground away by the cutter with his wheel of emery stone.— (Thomson.) 18 LB. 3 Q490 MAD-MAD worth speaking about. A good turquoise is found, and the money obtained from its sale is spent at once. Men can often be seen at the mines, who yearly pay to the Government 60 tumdns, and who gain another 150 tumans besides, having nothing to eat. The mines belonging to the Ma’dan villlage are— (1) the turquoise mines; I (3) a lead mine; (2) a salt mine ; | (4) a millstone quarry. _ (1) The turquoise mines are of two sorts :— (а) the mines proper, shafts and galleries in rock ; (б) the khaki mines, diggings in the detritus of a disintegrated rock washed down towards the plains. ' ,. (a) The mines 'proper .—1 he most easterly, and according to all accounts the oldest, mine is the ’Abd-ur-Razaq, which was formerly called the Abu ’Ishaqi, and is mentioned by that name in old books. It is at the absolute height of 5.900 feet. It is a very extensive mine, and has a depth of about 160 feet vertically from its mouth. For the last few years very few tur quoises have been obtained from this mine ; but its stones are greatly esteemed. Close to this mine, and in the same valley, .are the Surkh, Shahpardar, and Akali Mines, which are at present neglected. A little to the west of the Abd-ur-Razaq valley is the Darreh-i-Safid, “ the white val ley,” with the old mine Maliki, the upper and lower Zak, and the Mirza Ahmadi. The former are immense mines, but almost entirely filled up. In the lower Zak, now a vertical shaft of 60 feet in depth and about 250 feet in circumference, one can plainly see how the mines have got to tiieir present ruinous state. It is apparent that the mines were formerly well directed. Vertical shafts were cut into the rock for the purpose of lighting and ventilating the mines, whilst the entjunos to the mine was by lateral galleries driven iti on the slope of the mountains. Schindler thinks it very probable that the mines were, as late as the first quarter of the 18th century, worked by the Government. The mines were then, when the Safavian dynasty came to an end, neglected and left to the people of the village, or perhaps, as now, farmed to them. The farmers only thought of getting a quick return for their money, and cut away the rock wherever they saw any turquo.ses, exactly as they do at the present day. The result was that the supporting pillars and the rock between the different shafts were cut away, and the roof, so to say, of the whole mine fell in, filling it up. The three above- mentioned mines have been filled up like this. An estimate of the original depth of the Zak mine can be formed from its present depth, which is only to the surface of the formerly superincumbent roof, and from a shaft or burrow dug into the rubbish of the old mine. This burrow commences where the fallen-down roof begins, at a depth of 60 feet from the mouth of the mine, and goes down for about another 60 feet vertical. At the end of this burrow, 120 feet below the mouth of the mine, there are still no signs of the original old mine. Several attempts have been made to clear this ’mine ; but up to now no one has had the will to provide the necessary funds, or the patience to wait till the completion of the work. The turquoises of the “ White Valley ” are also very good ; but not so good as those of the ’Abd-ur-Razaq. Many turquoises, generally small, are found in the rubbishMAD—MAD 491 of tlie old mines ; they are much prized for theii good colour. The mouth of the Mirza AhmadI mine, which once probably formed part of the Zak mines, lies about 80 feet lower than that of the Zak mine, and goes down 80 feet vertical. It has also very good turquoises ; but working in it is very precarious, on account of the bad state of the galleries and the amount of loose rubbish they contain. The next valley is the Dar-i-Kuh. In it are several very important mines,—the Karbalai KarimI, the Dar-i-Kuh, and others. The Dar-i-Kuh (door of the mountain) mine is very deep going down some 150 feet vertical. It is an old and very extensive mine, and some of its galleries extend as far as the Zak mine. It is very dan gerous, on account of the amount of rubbish it contains. The rubbish is badly propped up by stones and small sticks, and several labourers have, at times, been buried in it. One of its galleries, called the Daniki, goes for about 100 feet through rubbish. The width of this gallery is about from 1 to 2 feet, its height not more; and the descent down it very dangerous. Only three or four of the miners have the courage to go into this gallery. Some galleries of this mine are coir pletely filled up, and could only be cleared at great expense and with difficulty. Above the mine can be seen many shafts, which formerly lighted and ventilated the mine, but i re now filled up. All the mines in the Dar-i-Kiih valley are worked, and contain good turquoises. Further west is the Darreh-i-Siah, the “ Black Valley,” with th old ’AJi Mirzai and the Ra’ish mines. The ’All Mirzai, particularly the lower one of that name, is very dangerous. The rock is very soft and much disinte grated. In often falls and fills up the mine. A part of this mine is called the “ Bi R ;,h Rau,” “ the shaft without a road,” to go down into which is very difficult. The turquoises of ’All Mirzai are not very good; their colour soon fades. On the top of the Ra’ish mines in the same valley, a vein of torquoises was discovered only a year or two ago, and a new mine was opened there, with the name of the “ Sar-i-Ra’ish ” (the “ Head of the Ra’ish”). In it are found turquoises of great size and good colour ; but the colour soon fades, and the stone becomes a dirty green with white and grey spots. As long as these turquoises are kept damp, they preserve their colour : if once they get dry, they are worth very little. The next valley, called the Darreh-i-Sabz, the “Green Valley,” contains the old ArdaTani and Sabz mines and the new Anjiri mines. The Ardalani was once a great mine. More than twelve old shafts, all now filled up, are still to be seen; its present entrance is by a large artificial cave with a dome-like roof. It has a vertical depth of 85 feet; but is badly ventilated, having several galleries full of foul air. Such galleries are called Chiragh Kush, i.e., “lamp extinguishers.” The Ardalani turquoises are not good.. The Sabz mine has, as its name implies, green turquoises, and is at present filled up. The Anjiri mines, which have their name from the fig trees growing in the valley, are new mines. They produced during the last few years a very great quantity of turquoises, which had a fine colour and were sold well. The colour of these turquoises, however, soon faded, and the pos sessors were not at all satisfied with their purchases. Schindler can- 3 q siCONFIDENTIAL.CONFIDENTIAL.

The people appear far more clean and comfortable, both in their houses and dress, than the generality of Persian peasants ; this may be accounted for by their paying no taxes, and by the profit they make by selling provisions to travellers. The original fort of ’Abbasabad is now ruined and lies to the north of the present village. ’Abbasabad has a post-house. The caravanserai has 36 rooms with doors, and 14 rooms open to the front ; it has two gates and a stream of water runs through its court. ’Abbasabad belongs to the Farumad sub-district of Shahrud-Bustam.— (Gibbons', Clerk', Eastwick', Petty, Bellew, Rozario', Napier', Khanikofj ; Schindler.) ’ABBASABAD (No. 4)— A village in the Turbat-i-Haidari district of Khorasan, a mile to the left of the road between Khaf and Turbat-i-Haidan, 51 miles from the former and 20£ miles from the latter.

A village in the Atak, called Bauard by the Turkomans, on the north-west frontier of Khorasan, and situated about midway between Kalat-i-Nadiri and Darreh Gaz, 35 miles from either place. It was a large town in the time of Nadir Shah, and remains of large brick buildings are still to be seen in its now only extensive ruins. It was inhabited by the ’Alili Turkomans, up to about 1866 when, quarrelling with the Governor of Darreh Gaz, they went off to Khiva and only returned after some years to settle at Kahkah. The tract has a reputation for surpassing fertility. Melons grown there are said to attain a weight of 15 lbs. and wheat to give a return of a hundred fold. For many years the valley was uninhabited. Both Turkomans and Kurds after settling in it found it untenable. Its rich harvests w'ere too great a temptation for plundering neighbours to withstand. In 1874 it was partly re-peopled, and contained about 150 houses of Turkoman subjects of Darreh Gaz. It possesses ample past ure, and is watered by a fine stream, Par-i-Su.

About 100 families of nomad ’Arabs who live in tents during the spring and summer, grazing their flocks in the district, return to the village in the winter, when the population is nearly doubled. The old fort in which the houses wnre situated during the time of the Turcoman raids is now deserted and in rums, and the people have built houses round it in the open.

It guards both the mountain pass and the passage of the Kashaf Rhd, flowing between its scarped banks. From the east the pass is closed by towers placed in com manding positions overhanging the defile, so that the position of Akdar- band becomes one of very considerable importance as regards the defence- of this frontier, as by it lies the only practicable road between Maz daran and the range bounding the Meshed valley on the south.

A large village in tlie Chinaran sub-division of the Meshed district of Khorasan. It is situated most picturesquely on the spurs of the Binalud Mountains enclosing a glen. A circle of high cliffs encloses a basin, in which lies the village and a great extent of terraced vineyards and gardens. A crag within the basin is crowned by a ruined fort built by Mamish Khan of Chinaran. The corn lands lie above the cliffs and out of the sight of the village. The only practicable road to Akhlamand leads through a deep and narrow gorge, with solid walls of rock 200 to 300 feet in height on either side. There is a path leading from Akhlamand over the hills to Bar, but it runs up a sort of “ devil’s staircase ” and nothing much but village donkeys can get over it. Akhlamand is consequently almost unapproachable except through the gorge, and there are the remains of a wall built across this about half a mile below the village. The road is blocked sometimes for a day by floods in spring, but never for longer than that. The village is in two parts, called the upper and lower, situated on the northern branch of the stream, and contains some 300 houses altogether. The river runs up some distance beyond through a deep and precipitous gorge, the bottom of which is full of trees, principally walnuts. The place is noted for its apples. In former days is it said to have been known as BIsheh-i-Gurazan, or the “pig jungle” from the number of wild boar it contained. Akhlamand contains thirty-six ploughs of cultivable land, of which 16 belong to the shrine of Imam Riza at Meshed, 9. to Government and only 11 to the people. The revenue amounts to 400 tumdns in cash, 200 kharwdrs of grain and 192 khanvdrs of chopped straw. A couple (Napier says 4) of miles below the village is a fine large dam built of stone and mortar, 260 (Napier says 250) paces in length and some 14 in breadth (Napier says 23 in width at the top), with a height of about 40 (Napier says 50) feet, closing the mouth of the glen and intended to retain the water of the Akhlamand stream. Four circular wells of solid masonry, built within the stone work of the dam, provide for the escape of water through tunnels or arched passages; communicating with it at the base. The dam is damaged at present (1897), and water, which now passes through a sluice under it, is held up only for a short time in the spring. The land in front of the dam is all under cultivation. —{Napier ; C. E. Yate ; Mania Bakhsh.) AKHLI— A village containing about 200 families in the Bujnurd district of Khora- san .—{Mania Bakhsh.) IK KALEII (No. 1)— Lat. 36° 56' 40'; Long. 54° 24' 30'.—{Napier.) A fort on the south side of the river Gurgan, in Astarabad, 10| miles north of the town of Astarabad on the_ road to Kara Kala, and about 35 miles from the Atrak. The river at Ak Kaleh is crossed by a 4-arched bridge with a 10-foot roadway, the depth of the river at this point being 15 to 16 feet. The fort is a rectangular work of about 500 feet sides. It is of no military value whatever. The bridge can be surprised at any moment,16 AKK—AKY and not a gun can be trained on to command its approach, by many degrees. It is supposed to be a fete-de-powi; but as the bridge is left quite unprotected [ on the north bank, it can hardly be said to fulfil its function. It is said that this defect has been brought to the notice of the Shah, who directed that a strong work should be erected on the north side to cover the bridge. His Majesty’s directions have been fulfilled by the erection of a summer house three storeys high. The bridge is falling into disrepair. The fort is garrisoned by 300 sarbdzes (infantry soldiers) and 20 gun ners with 3 Austrian and 3 Persian guns at the bridge over the Gurgan, 13 miles north of Astarabad.—; Napier ; Thomson ; C. E.

It lies at the foot of the Sarai range which bounds the valley on the south. The Armutli plain drains westward through an opening at the end of the valley, through a gorge which is one of the sources of the Gurgan. It joins the main Gurgan defile a few miles below the village of Dasht The plain is only cultivated in the vicinity of Armutli, Robat-i-Karabil and Robat-i- Ishq. The soil of the valley is very soft and adhesive after rain, and difficult for wheels on that account. It is nearly level. In dry weather guns passalong with ease. In the spring of 1888 the Rukn-ud-Daiileh brought his guns this way from Simalqan, to which he had driven them from Meshed via Kuchan and Bujmlrd. The passes by which the Yamuts cross into the Armutli plain from the north are as follows, beginning from the east:— 1. The Chalbash pass. 2. The Yakeh Taqlan. 3. The Chanda ’Abbas pass. 4. The branch of the Gurgan defile which carries off the drainage of the Armutli plain, at the western end of the valley.

An island at the mouth of Astarabad bay, on which are the barracks of the Russian garrison of detachments of two regiments of infantry, and the residence of the Commodore of the East Caspian Squadron and other officials. Three or four small vessels of war and a few steam-launches are stationed in the bay to watch the Turkomans, and collect the duty levied on their boats. These trade only between their own ports and the village ports of the Astarabad and Mazandaran coasts and the island of Chilikan, 1 _ _ whence they bring cargoes of naphtha and salt. See aV&gt; Astarabad Bay. -Every boat is bound to show the Russians a pass. This rule is rigorously enforced, and has put an entire stop to the piratical incursions of the Turkomans, from which the coast had so long suffered It is very favourably situated for commerce. The inhabitants of ABushun migrated to it on the destruction of their city. There is an excellent harbour to the south of the island, where ships drawing 8 or 10 feet of water can lie off within half-a-mile of the shore ’ r and the sea is never sufficiently heavy to prevent communication with the land. There is a new pier, about 16 feet broad and nearly 350 feet long, that would enable boats to disembark troops or stores readily. Khamkoff says that the Great Ashurada island is not half the size it was 4&lt;J years avo. The whole of the western portion is washed away ; while, on the other hand Little Ashurada island on the eastern side is beipg enlarged. He predicts that in 20 years Great Ashuiada will not exist. _ The value to Russia of Ashuiada consists m a measure m the fact that there are only 9 feet of water all along this coast; so, under cover of the naval station here, she can disembark troops and stores m Astaralad bay.— {Napier ; Pushchin', Lovett) Petrusevitch.)

A number of sailing and steam ships-of-war are always stationed here, detached from the Baku squadron. The place of anchorage is on the south-east side of the island, at 450 yards from the shore, having a depth of about 17 feet of water ; the bottom being a grey mud. On the island a wooden church has been built, and some houses in which the officials of the station reside ; also a j ost office, magazine, club, library ; as well as houses for the families of the officers and men serving on the station. On account of the scarcity of timber, most of the buildings on the island of Ashurada are constructed of reeds and plastered mud. Gardens have been laid out in the western end of the island near the church, and trees have been planted around almost every house. The principal buildings are the church, the house of the Commandant, and the wooden store-house of the Transcaspian Company. In many parts of the inhabited portion of the island wells have been sunk, which give good, sweet water. The latitude of the island, at the sun dial near the Commandant’s house, is 36° 54 / 35' / and the longitude 53° 26' 15' ; its distance from Baku is 280 miles. Although the climate of the island of Ashurada and of the bay of Astarabad is considered feverish, yet sickness is less prevalent here than in many other places on the southern and western shores of the Caspian ; e.g., at Enzali, the island of Sari, and the mouth of the Kiuri, where fever is of a fatal kind. The sailors living on board ship are in a more favourable condition of health than the residents on the island, and therefore suffer less from fevers. The bay of Astarabad, which extends on a parallel from the Eastern Turkoman shore, has a length of about 42 miles, and its greatest width in the eastern portion is about 8 miles ; it gradually narrows to the west, and near the end becomes quite narrow and shallow. The eastern bank of the bay is low, marshy, and almost entirely covered with reeds. The southern shore is also low, but in many places is clothed by a thick growth of forest or underwood. This vegetation decreases near the Kara Su, and from this point the eastern portion of the bay commences, on which hardly any forest is met with, but in its place a scanty undergrowth and a barren, sandy plain, in places covered with reeds. On the southern or Gaz shore, the oak, maple, chirar (plane tree), beech, walnut, mulberry, etc., flourish in abundance ; whilst of fruit trees, the vine, pomegranate, orange, fig, lemon, Grecian walnut, and almond grow in gardens and in a wild state. Here and there, where the forest thins, are extensive meadows sown with rice, sesamum, wheat, cotton, etc. On the shore villages are scattered about without any regularity, the inhabitants of which live in the greatest poverty. The most considerable of these is B.' ndar-i-Gaz, which lies almost on the meridian of Ashurada, near the stream of the same name, and about 2 miles from the shore. There is a Persian custom house here, almost all the trade between the province of Astarabad and Russia passing through Gaz. The country about this village, as indeed the greater part of this littoral, is marshy, and becomesAST—AST 37 impassable after rain. On the meridian of the Kara Tappeh stream, and about 5 miles from the shore, lies the town of Ashraf, once celebrated for its magnificent palaces and gardens of cypress, mulberry, pomegranate, lemon, and orange trees. At f mile to the north of Ashraf stands the castle of Sufiabad amidst the ruins of the Sufiabad palace. From this castle, which is built on the summit of a hill and is plainly visible from Astarabad Bay, a magnificent view of the Caspian Sea is obtained. These palaces and gardens, constructed at the close of the sixteenth century by the Persian Shah ’Abbas, are now but a group of desolate ruins. A large number of streams have their source in the adjacent mountains, and follow a winding course through the fertile region on the south of the bay, many of them not drying up with the summer heats, but reaching the bay itself. The principal of them are the Kara Su and the Bagu, up which small boats can proceed during the spring floods. The Kara Su or Charnaya falls into the bay on the east, and is distinguished from the other above-men tioned rivers as much by its considerable size as by the transparency and sweet taste of its waters. All the remaining streams are inconsiderable , the water in them, although sweet, is diverted at flood time for the irriga tion of the fields, and acquires a turbid appearance and a bad taste. The peninsula of Putamkui or Mian Kali was uninhabited up to 1873 ; after this date Persian forts were built on the western side for the defence of the Persian villages on the coast from the attacks of the Turkomans. In 1876 three towers were built on the extremity of the sandspit for a similar purpose. This peninsula is low, sandy, and marshy, in many places covered with thick reeds and thin brushwood. Reeds are still more plentiful on the shor s of the bay, and serve as a retreat for the boats of the piratical Turkomans when pursued by the Russians from the Astarabad station. Astarabad Bay is deepest in its eastern portion, opposite the islands of Ashurada (20 or 25 feet). Going westward the depth gradually decreases and 31 to 4 miles from the end it is under 6 feet. The bottom is mud mixed in places with sand. The shores are generally low, shelving sand banks, almost entirely covered with reeds ; the southern shore is more shelving than the northern, which, from the Turkoman shore to the meridian of the Kara Tappeh, is composed in a great measure of sand and small par ticles of mud. This sand disappears as the centre of the bay is approached , and in the deep water only mud is met with. The southern shore is cut up bv numerous streams and channels, the beds of which are of very adhesive mud The ground to the west of the river Kara Tappeh is particularly soft, and this extehds over the whole of that portion of the baj ; so that it is impossible to reach the shore on foot except at the risk of sticking in the mud. The islands afford the most suitable landing places in the bay, especially Ashurada, opposite to which there is 12 feet of water not more than a cable length from the shore ; opposite the two other islands the same depth is found at two cables’ length from the shore. On the northern shore of these islands, that is, outside the bay, 12-feet soundings are met with at a considerably greater distance - viz., 1 mile from Great Ashur and li miles from Middle Ashui. On tie northern38 AST—AST shore of Little Ashhr a sand-bank runs out in a nor’-nor’-easterly direction, where 12 feet of water is not to be found nearer than 3| miles from the bank. Near the end of this sand-bank, in a depth of from 16 to 17 feet of water, and 4J miles* in a direction bearing 15° north-east from Little Ashur, and 6| miles at a bearing of 51° from Great Ashur, is placed a floating lightship. The height of the lantern above the sea is 38‘5 feet, and its horizontal spread of light is 7'1 miles; but at an elevation of 10 feet the light is visible up to 10£ miles. The lightship is black and one- masted. By day a yellow flag with a blue cross is hoisted, and at night a reflecting apparatus of eight lamps. In stormy and thick weather a bell is rung every ten minutes. The latitude of the lightship is 36° 58' 30 /l ', and longitude 53° 31' 55' east of Greenwich. It lies 287 miles south-east from the island of Nargin, 255 miles south-east from the end of the Shakau sand spit that bounds Baku Bay, and 116 miles sou’-sou’-east from the end of the island of Ugurchin. This lightship serves to mark the passage by the narrow channel, depth 15 to 20 feet, which lies between the above-mentioned sand-bank and the Turkoman coast. The length of the channel from the lightship to Little Ashur is barely 4 miles ; the width about a mile. At the western extremity of the sand-bank, almost in mid channel, lies a shoal marked on the eastern side by a black buoy. Another buoy painted white is placed at the extremity of the sand-bank, which runs out to the east from Little Ashur. In order to enter the Astarabad Bay by this channel, a course south or south-J east must be held from the lightship on the black buoy, which is left to the west ; thence the same course may be held, or a slight bend may be made to the west, and the course be directed on the white buoy. Having passed this on the west side, a westerly course will lead straight on to the Ashur roadstead, where ships can anchor at from 200 to 500 yards from the shore in 17 feet of water having a muddy bottom. The distance between the lightship and the black buoy is If miles, between the black and white buoys is 3 miles, and from the latter to the Ashur road stead is 4 miles, so that the whole distance from the lightship to the roadstead is 8f miles,* the bottom being mud the whole way. To enter the Astarabad Bay in stormy weather, when it is impossible to see the kghtship or to hear signals, it is necessary to keep in the deep water by the eastern shore and to cast the lead frequently. When the ship is about 6 or 7 miles north of the lightship, the eastern shore should be hugged, which is distinguished at this spot (south of the Hasan Quli Bay) by but slight depth of water. After this a depth of 25 feet is reach ed, and a course sou’-sou’-east is held until a less depth of water is reached. About the latitude of Khwaja Nafas, a depth of from 14 to 15 feet should be found and a soft clay bottom ; thence the course is south, keeping to the Turkoman shore in a depth of 17 to 18 feet. The soft mud shows the proximity of the Turkoman coast, where the depth of water lessens gradually : a sandy bottom betokens the nearness of the Ashurada sand-bank, where the depth of ^ater rapidly decreases, so that from 21 feet, 10 and 8 feet are very quickly reached. * Probably geographical miles.AST-AST 39 Astarabad Bay is completely sheltered from wind, and affords one of the most favourable anchorages in the Caspian Sea, both as regards bottom and depth of water, and also as regards extent. The prevalent wind is westerly, and it blows more frequently in summer than in winter : it raises the water of the bay, and when very violent inundates all the islands, not excepting Great Ashurada, which, however, at its western and higher end escapes complete submersion. To the influence of this wind, too, must be attributed the formation of the Putamkui sand-bank and the Ashur islands and also the change in the outline of the islands which is progress ing at the present time, by which the north-western part of the island of Ashurada is being gradually washed away by the action of the wind and waves whilst the eastern end of the island is constantly increasing. The channel between Great Ashur and Putamkui has from the above cause gradually deepened in the course of 15 years (from 1859 to 1874) to the amount of 2 feet, and from the later date it has been used by Turkoman boats and others drawing 4 to 5 feet of water The other winds m the bay are not remarkable for violence ; but after the west winds, the north west and north are most prevalent, and in winter blow strongly In summer a so-called hot wind blows at intervals from the south-west V\ hen this wind drops, there is generally a sea breeze m the day time and a lard breeze at night. There is no constant current m the bay, but one is formed bv the ebb and flow of the water, and on this account depends on the force and duration of the wind. At the commencement of a westerly vmd the water flows out of the bay ;_but afterwards, when the wmd increases, the ^The^ater^eve^varies during the year from 2 to 3| feet; the water being lowest in December and January, and highest m June and July Opposite the place of anchorage, that is to say on the south-eastern shore of Great Ashurlda, a wooden pier has been constructed, alongside which small craft and cutters can He with ease. On the Gaz shore there are no landmg places at all: and communica tion with this part of the coast is therefore unfavourable, both from the sticky mud of which the bottom is composed,' and from the shelving nature of the shore, which does not permit of even small craft approaching H Kshtg in the Astarabad Bay, as well as in all other Persian waters, is farmed out to Armenians. The most common fish are the white dolphm “itls^possibkto 'coast'along the whole of the southern shore of the Caspian bugging the land the whole way. From the lightship the course is west’bv south for 46 miles, the depth being from 20 to 40 feet The village of Farrukhabad can be recognized by a tower of defence situated on the shore From Farrukhabad to Meshed-i-Sar, course south-west 75 , ^ cint 224 miles, depth of water from 50 to 55 feet; from Meshcd-i- Sar to the Chapkal roadstead, course north-west 75° distance 124 anles^ Prom Safid Rud to Enzali the course is along the shore north-west 82, From , t h rapidly increases in proportion to distance from shore From’ Enzali to Astara, course north-west 25°, distance 63 miles. From Enzali to the western extremity of Nargm the .course is north-west40 AST—AST 70°, distance 170 miles. Following the same course, and passing the Baku group of islands, a greater or less depth of water will indicate any deviation of the course to east or west. Above the latitude of the Kura Rock the remarkable depth of 18 fathoms is met with, with a rocky bottom, which shows a slight deviation off the course to the west. If this deviation should be considerable, the above-mentioned deep water will be left to the east, and then it will be necessary to be on the look-out for the Kura Bank and St. Ignatius. In case of doubt, or when encountering strong easterly winds, it is best to make for the Kura Rock, and, having determined its position, continue the course according to circumstances. From Enzali to Apsharun, the course is north-west 15°, and the distance to the latitude of the Shah- kuf sand-spit is 171 miles. Off the island of Los the depth of water in the course is about 35 fathoms, and, as the Shahkuf sand-spit is approached, the ~ depth gradually decreases to 9 or 10 fathoms. From the Ashurada light ship to Astara the course is north-west 70J°, and the distance 268 miles ; to the Kura Rock, north-west 611°, distance 254 miles ; to the north-east bank, north-west 574°, distance 263 miles, leaving the Kura Bank 5 miles to the north, and passing its meridian in a depth of about 25 fathoms, from which spot to the north-east bank is 12 miles. If the depth on the meridian of the Kura Bank should be less than the above, it indicates either that the course has deviated to the north or that the ship is near the shore. As, however, the sea between the Kura Bank and the Kura Rock is quite free from any danger from hidden rocks, it is best to keep some degrees lower so as to pass near the Kura Rock ; and, when the shore is seen, to change the course as much as may be necessary to the north. The course from the Ashurada lightship to Baku is north-west 44°, and the distance of the island of Nargin, directly on which the course lies, is 278 miles. The bank of Makarof, 9 feet high, is left 4£ miles to the west. As soon as a ship passes the latitude of this bank, the Baku towns of Ushi and Apsharun are sight ed, on which the course can always be directed. The course to Apsharun is north-west 41°, and the distance to the sand-spit of Shahkuf about 260 miles. Lastly, if it is desired to go from the Ashurada lightship to the eastern side of the naphthian rocks ,a course north-west 36° must be held. As the latitude of these rocks is approached, it is necessary to cast the lead and to avoid a depth of less than 23 fathoms. The distance is about 245 miles.— (Pushchin.) ASTARABAD (District) (No. 3)— The greatest width of the district, excluding the tributary Turkoman Extent and nature of tracts from the Kara Su to the borders of country. Shahrud, is about 40 miles ; its greatest length 6 a , verage i J ld ^ from Gulugah, east to the limits of Kuhsar scarcely more ^than 12 a b ou ^ 100 miles. By its natural features it is miles. conveniently divided into two longitudinal sections—the northern or lower, consisting of plain, the southern or upper of mountain. The plain between the Bay Ashurada and the mountains, known as the Anahzan buluh, has a width of about 8 miles ; between the Kara Su and the mountains it widens to about -4 JAST-AST 41 12 miles ; tlience eastwards to Naudeh, 50 miles in a direct line, it main tains a uniform width of about 10 miles. Nearly the whole of this area is covered with dense forest. There is a strip of open country towards the Kara Su, and some considerable clearings to the east, which together might perhaps amount to one-fifth ; the remaining four-fifths is unin habited, and almost impenetrable ; for where the forest is thin, a dense growth of thorn bushes takes its place. The mountainous section includes, to the west, the upper course of the Mountains. Nikah river, the mountains Shah Kfih (10,000 * Approximate elevation, feet*), Jehan Numeh (8,900 feet), and Gaz Dagh (7,300 feet), with all their valleys and plateaux. Eastward it takes in only the lower northern slopes of Elburz till it reaches the valley of Naudeh, where the Kuhsar plateau stretches out again to a width of 10 to 15 miles. More uhan half this area must be covered with forest j. the remainder is chiefly mountain pasture and barren rock. Save in the' Kuhsar, where there are some fine stretches of cornland, the cultivated area would bear but a small proportion to the forest and waste. Astarabad is rendered by natural obstacles peculiarly difficult of access. Routes and roads. It is most open towards the Caspian, but there still intervene between the town and the shore of the Ashurada Bay 14 miles of low, swampy forest land, over which the impedimenta of an army could not be transported without the construction of a road and numerous bridges. Troops landed at Gumish Tappeh might, by a detour reach Astarabad.. without much difficulty, save in time of flood. The distance would be 30 miles. The Anahzan buluk, forming the western border, is covered with impenetrable forest, and traversed by numerous small streams flowing in deep and muddy beds. The Shah ’Abbas causeway was once an efficient highway, though it is now so completely ruined by neglect that the traffic of the country passes on either side of it through deep sloughs, which are, however, preferable to the broken pavement of the road with its treacherous pitfalls. The nature of the streams, flowing invariably in narrow and permanent beds, and the unlimited supply of wood at hand, would facilitate the construction of a temporary road for the passage of troops ; and a well raised and drained permanent-way might, with moderate care, be kept open at all seasons. To the south the district is cut off from easy access with the highlands Across the Elburz of Kllor asan and ’Iraq by the Elburz. The passes leading directly south across the range are all exceedingly difficult, and could not be traversed by a properly equipped army without much delay and labour in road-making. Exclusive of village paths, which are for the most part fit only for mule- traffic, there are three principal lines that might be improved into fair military roads. The first passes through Anahzan, the village Gulugah, and Mazandaran as far as the Pul-i-Nikah, where it turns south-east, following the Nikah or Shamshirbur stream up to its source. The second follows the same line as far as Gulugah ; then turning south over a great forest covered spur, 48 I. B. f42 AST—AST meets the former at Radkan. The third crosses the mountains due south east of Astarabad by the Quzluq pass. To the east the district is shut in by the hilly country drained by the Gurgan and Atrak ; but there is one magnificent natural pass through the chain, which would facilitate the opening of communication with the eastern provinces. To the south-east there is a route across the Gurgan plain and up the Atrak and its tributaries, the , Chandir and Ab-i-Sunt, and past Kara Kala to the Akhal “Atak,” which will, according to native information, be found to present many advantages over the desert route by Kizil Arvat. Northwards Astarabad and the Atrak-Gurgan plain are shut in by the desert that extends to the foot of the Ust Urt plateau and north-east to the Oxus. There are several routes across this desert, of which, however, no fresh information is available. One of them, from Chikishlj a: north by the Aiden Well, and thence as far as ftrta Kineh, has been traversed by a Russian column, the retreat of which appears to have resulted from failure of baggage animals rather than from want of water. The difficulties of any such routes are nevertheless, no doubt, enormous— a fact that enhances the value of the desert steppe as a political boundary. The population of Astarabad itself, taken from an official computation of the number of houses now inhabited, is said to be 10,000. Six souls are allowed to each house. The population of the eastern buluks —Katul, Fidarisk, and Kuhsar— r , has been estimated at about 31,000, which may be a little under the mark. Anahzan is for its extent thinly peopled, and Shahkuh-u-Savar has scarcely any population. The tracts about Astarabad and the base of Western buluks. Payg a comparatively large population. The peopl) of the eastern buluks are chiefly Garill Turks, and speak Turkish as well as Persian. They are a fine, Character. hardy race, of good physique, with a great reputation for courage, and are for the most part well armed. Estimating the population of the eastern buluks at 30,000 men, about 6,000 to 7,000 adults would be found fit to bear arms and ready at very short notice. In the Kfthsar, it has been estimated, 1,500 men might be had in a day; at Naudeh, 1,000; and at Ramujan, 1,000. Between Fidarisk and Katul, where the population is denser, an equal number would, no doubt, be found as readily. The glens leading from the Kuhsar plateau to the plain held by the Guklan Turkomans are inhabited by a small The Hajilar clan. tribe of Turk, or, by one account, Baluch origin; who, from the natural strength of their country, and the light hold of the Persians on the Gurgan plain, are able to maintain a certain amount of independence. It was lately found so difficult to control them from Astarabad that they were temporarily handed over to the tender mercies of the Ilkhani of Bujnurd, who was able to reach them, if necessary. They, however, submitted and paid the arrears of the tribute due. They number 1,000 tents, and have an immense local reputation for courage.AST—AST 43 strength, and expertness with their guns. . In the western buluks the population is slightly more mixed : there are many Tajiks and some few villages of Kajars ; also two villages, Yangi Mahalleh and Muhammadabad, near Astarabad, chiefly of Hazara Barbaris, immigrants of an ancient date. There is a mixture also of lats a_ tribe apparently of Persian origin, found in larger numbers m Mazandaran. Though inferior to the people of the east in appearance and reputation the peasantry of the west are hardy, fairly armed and well acquainted with the forest paths and the proper modes of bush-fighting. A levy en masse there would produce about the same number of armed men as m the eas of the district. The town population is very mixed. There are Tajiks, Kajars, and T v , and a number of families of Afghans and Hazaras, as well as a colony o Turis from Kurram. It increased slightly during the famine, but is still far below what it once was, as is evidenced by large spaces within enclosure covered with ruins and vacant habitations. The material condition of the Astarabad population is as might be expect- ed, far superior to that of the population of Material condition. Khorasan. The peasants in the eastern and mountain tract and the lowland villages, from which an annual immigration to the “ mllda ” or summer quarters, is customary, are physically as fine or nearly J a/’the average Klorasan peasant, and they have also a robust, “ 25m and on the coast, haggard, fever-worn faces are however • nnrl pvil effect of the climate is most marked on the ciniaren, ITeZedateared to be well led and sufficiently clothed ; and a very large p ' portion sodothed as to show that they had little need to work wrth the.r ha Th 3 ere were in fact signs on all prrts of a steady progress in material prosperity, due to increased security and an increased demand for *be Pro- ductLs of the land-causes that will, it may be presumed, continue to 5acTsk5nTvZges aldtheZfS old q anats are common enough «»,—-a room for further I“P r ° ve 5(&gt;overnment towards the Turkomans, nomio- “sZ'rZ^; for aZree'for the defence of the border has still to be maintained and paid. F 244 AST—AST Though the times are so much changed, and their Turkoman neighbours Eolations with Turkomans. are not ^ scour g e the J once were to the peasantry of Astarabad, the latter still regard the roving nomad as a deadly enemy. The “ Charvds,” or nomadic Yamuts, are alone the object of this feeling, for the nomad who has settled down and joined the “ Chumur,” or agricul tural class, becomes a neighbour, with w^hoin intercourse is maintained more or less close and friendly, as his connection with the plundering camps is distant or otherwise. Towards their own Government, in spite of their more prosperous condi tions, the feelings of the people are as hostile as in other parts ; and it is said that they are entirely open to Russian influence, and would accept Russian rule as a deliverance. The evils of a weak and unsympathetic government have been as keenly felt on this border as in the eastern districts ; and the contrast between the Russian system and their own is fully appreciated. The extension of Russian rule is regarded apparently by all classes as inevitable and a matter of time merely. Possibly actual contact will arouse feelings of antagonism ; but, to judge from the spirit of the people, Russian annexation would be followed by the voluntary submis sion of all the important classes. Russian influence has for years been at work in the country, and the “sense of the inevitable,” which alone must go far to crush out all idea of opposition, is aided by a firm belief in the superior material advantages that would be secured by Russian rule; among the first and greatest of which is believed to be complete relief from troubles at the hands of the Turkomans. “ May the Russians come to-morrow, if their coming will stay the hands of these descendants of the evil one,” is a sentiment reiterated so often, and with so much fervour, that it wmuld, without doubt, have great effect in paving the way to a peaceful subjugation. The power that makes light of the Turkomans cannot in their imagination have any equal upon earth. ^ It is worthy of note that though there is an immense area of cultivable Resources waste, both irrigated and unirrigated, capable of bearing wheat crops, and no great scarcity of labour, even the pressure of five years’ famine in the neighbouring highlands failed to produce any but the most moderate extension of grain culture in the Persian villages or the Turkoman camps. The difficulties of export across the Elburz, and the insecurity of the roads along the border were the chief obstacles to a remunerative export of corn ; and to these obstacles, no doubt, the loss of many thousand lives in Khorasan may be charged. In the Gurgan tracts, in the autumn of 1872, when the famine was at its height, wheat was in such abundance that no market could be found for it in the country; and it did not repay export. The second staple food in the district, and all along the southern Rice&gt; shores of the Caspian, is rice. In the western buluJcs little else is gjown, the wheat-growing tracts^ being chiefly to the east about Fidarisk and Katul. A large quantity is exported to Shahrud and to Russia from Gaz. The greater portion of this would, of course, be at the disposal of a force holding theAST—AST 45 -X, country and main lines of communication. The Guklan and the Yamut “ Chumurs ” grow a considerable quantity of wheat beyond their own requirements, for sale and barter to the “ Chdrvds ” or nomad Yamuts ; but this source of supply would not be available to a Russian force unless they succeeded in securing the hearty co-operation of the tribes. From the resources of the district of Astarabad alone it would thus Resources of Astarabad in- appear that a large force could hardly be sufficient for a large force. supported for any length of time, and could certainly not rely upon the district as a base from whence a continuous supply for a distant expedition might be collected. Improvements of com munications will, no doubt, lead to a great extension of the corn-growing area and of the capabilities of the district for supply; but such improve ments progress slowly in Persia. Large armies have nevertheless within recent times been marched into and maintained for some months in and about Astaiabad. ASTARABAD (Province) (No. 4)— A province of Persia between lat. 36° 45' 0' and 37° 20',0' and long. 54° and 56°. It is bounded on the north by the Gurgan river, south by the Elburz mountains and Shahrud district, west by the Caspian and Mazandaran, from which it is divided by the Gulugah stream, and east by the district of J ajarm and the plateau of Armutli. The Turkoman tribes north of the Gurgan own a nominal allegiance to the Shah and to the Governor of Astarabad. It is divided into the following districts under their respective governors Anahzan, Sadam Rustak, Astarabad Rustak, Katul. The two former lie west of Astarabad, Shahkuh and Savar, Findarisk and Ku hsar, Astarabad Rustak to the north, and the remainder to the east. The south portion is lofty and mountainous ; but immediately below, an extensive plain of surpassing beauty and richness stretches out to the north, east, and west. Towards the Caspian, however, the country, though still remaining level, loses its beauty and fertility, and exhibits the well-known characteristics of a steppe. Great part of the surface, both towards the south slope and throughout the rich plain, is covered with magnificent forests, so close and tangled as not only to be often impassable, but to exclude the proper circulation of the air and generate pestilential vapours. The diseases thus spread over the province have repeatedly made fearful ravages, and are so much dreaded by the roving Turkomans, of whom the rural population chiefly consists, that when rain sets in and begins to form stagnant pools and swamps, they retire beyond the Atrak, preferring the verge of a burning sandy desert to the fatal luxuriance of Astarabad. The inhabitants of the villages, being stationary, have not the same resource, and suffer severely from sickness. The total revenue of the province of Astarabad amounts to about £6,350; £3,000 from the province, £3,000 from the Turkomans, £300 from the town, and £50 from the fisheries. Of this, £2,000 are allowed the governor as a salary, though he probably manages to obtain more than double that sum by means of fines, confiscations, presents, etc. The remainder of the revenue is expended in the salaries of the different Government officers and a part for the pay of the irregular soldiery, who are all matchlockmen.46 AST—AST and receive a nominal pay of £1 a year. A rough approximation of the population of the province is given by Mr. Holmes, who visited it in 1843, at 83,000. The dress of the people of Astarabad is the same as that of the Mazandar- anls, and most of them speak both Persian and Turkish. Besides the native peasantry, there are about 100 families from Kara Pagh settled here and called Maqsudlis, and from 100 to 120 families of Baluchis. Of the Kajar tribe, there are now only about 500 families—400 in the town and 100 among the villages ; the rest are scattered all over Persia, with the various governors of provinces who have been chosen from this tribe. The climate of Astarabad is unwholesome, being excessively hot in sum mer and damp and often cold in winter. The people have a pale and haggard appearance ; and such a thing as a rosy cheek is not to be seen in the province. The roads of the province are partly good, partly swampy and difficult. Astarabad possesses many torrents, which in the autumn become either dry or mere rivulets, but can boast of only one river—the Kara Su. The Gurgan and the Atrak are in a territory in a measure subject to Persia and under the government of this province, but can hardly be said to belong to it geographically. There are fine sturgeon fisheries at the mouths of all these streams, and also in the Bay of Astarabad. The agricultural products of Astarabad are rice,* barley, wheat, cotton, and sesame. Several kinds of “ kirbas,” a native manufacture of cotton, are made, and a considerable quantity of soap. The mountainous districts are rich in mineral products, especially iron ; coal is found in Shahkuh, but the people do not understand how to work it properly. The Russian trade with the Astarabad province is not very considerable. Of the articles exported to Russia, the chief are cotton, walnut-wood, tim ber, and sesamum oil; the two former are conveyed by ship to several ports on the Caspian and to Astrakhan, whence they are taken up the Volga. The Persian walnut is not of special value, and is subject to become worm- eaten. Sesamum oil is exported to Astrakhan/, but it does not go beyond this town, as it commands but little sale in Russia. The Turkomans sell small quantities of carpets, fine felt, swan’s down, etc. The principal imports from Russia are iron, copper, and porcelain utensils, samavars (tea- urns), cast-iron articles, candles, sugar, etc. From Baku come kerosine and salt, and from Chilikan Island naphtha and salt. Tea from India. It is difficult to estimate the resources of the province with reference to its capability for the support of a body of troops, as taxes are not here levied on the produce as in other parts of Persia. The land tenure in this Government is thus regulated : for rice lands, 5| kharudrs per qismat, considered as rent, is paid to the landlord, be he a private individual or, as in the case of khdlisa lands, the Shah. This rent amounts to 1J tons of rice for 2'04 acres under rice cultivation. Khushk-i-ZuTat, that is, barley, wheat, etc., pay as rent one-tenth part of the produce. The saifi crops, that is, oil-seeds, cotton, lentils, and garden produce, pay one-eighth of the produce. * The crown lands in the Astarabad district yield 12,000 kharwars of rice per n nnum, and the value of this is credited to the Government Treasury at the fixed rata of 2 turmns per Astarabad kharwar (585lhs.).— [G. E. Y ate, 189k )AST—AST 47 It is known that in 1863 a force of 40,000 men under Mukammad Mirza Khan the then Sipah Salar, remained encamped about Astarabad for eight months. The price of bread and meat did not rise. The sole commodity of which the cost was enhanced was rice. Since that date, owing to the security and peace resulting from the Russian occupation of Turkomama, the productiveness of the district has so much increased, that it is generally asserted that five times the quantity of cereals required for local con sumption are raised. The surplus is exported largely to Shahrud and Khorasan, and a small quantity to the Russian ports from Gaz. For commissariat purposes the district surrounding the town of Astar abad might conveniently be divided into five zones the first zone having a radius of 2 miles from the city ; the second zone of 4 miles ; the third of 8 miles ; the fourth of 12 miles ; and, finally, the fifth of 16 miles.

Assuming the low rate of four persons per house, the result is a popula tion of 20,216 souls ; and, applying the proportion quoted above of a surplus of 500 per cent, on the local consumption of food, we have food apparently produced sufficient for the yearly consumption of over 100,000 souls. There would, therefore, evidently be supplies sufficient for a con siderable force, after leaving a broad margin for errors and omissions in the above calculation. As regards the possible development of the resources of Astarabad under a different administration to the present, considering the great fertility of the soil, not only of the uplands to the south, but of the easily irrigated tract between the Kara Su and the Atrak ; considering also the untouched resources in timber, the limitless water power available in the mountain gorges, and also the mildness of the climate—it is easy to see that by a proper development of these resources, and by colonization by German and Russian peasants, the products might be multiplied twenty times. In 1724 Peter the Great invaded the territory south of the Caucasus, and having taken Darband entered into a treaty with Persia, by which that power ceded Daghistan, Shirvan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Astarabad ; but the attempt to take over the three latter was never made. Nevertheless the noteworthy fact remains that the whole of the Caspian provinces of Persia were ceded to Russia by a treaty, which has never been formally annulled.— (Holmes ; Kinneir ; Monteith ; Chesnsy ; Eastwick ; Fraser ; Pushchin ; Lovett ; Astarabad Trade Report, 1990). ASTARABAD (Town) (No. 5)—Lat. 36° 50' 52' ; Long. 54° 25' 26'; Elev. 377'— (Lemm.) The chief and only city'of the province of the same name. It is situated at the foot of the north-west slope of the Elburz and on the river Astar^ which falls into the Astarabad bay in the south-east of the Caspian, 20 miles below. It is enclosed within a crenellated mud wall* about 35 feet high and from 3 to 4 miles in circumference, flanked by a series of round towers ; and it had once been strengthened by a ditch, now in most places filled up. These defences, particularly on the north and east sides of the town, are in ruins, and would oppose no obstacle to an attack. There are three gateways—one to the west, where the walls are in the best repair ; one to the south ; and one to the north-east; they are roofed, and have small chambers on each side serving as a lodging for the guard. The present town by no means fills up the space enclosed, which is partly occupied by gardens and heaps of rubbish, the remains of former habitations.. It is divided into three quarters,■f’ and contains about 1,200 inhabited houses and about 10,000 inhabitants. The houses are built with mud or sun-dried bricks of a light, open style of architecture, with projecting fronts and sloping roofs covered with red tiles or thatch. Many of them have sn all gardens filled with orange, pomegranate, cherry, and other fruit trees ; and * Now quite out of dis’opair (1909). t NaTfcandan, Maidan or Darvazeh Nau and Sabz Moshod (formerly known as Sukhtoh Chinar). 48 I.

Astarabad has five gates ; the Shahrud or Bustam gate to the east, that of Cnehil Dukhtar or Forty Virgins (so called from a raid made by Turkomans in which 40 maidens were captured) to the south ; the Mazandaran to the west; the Sabz Meshed and Dankivan (in ruins) to the north ; on the west, too, there is a ridge running out for £ mile to an eminence some 200 feet high, which has once been fortified and f loo ^ s as for an acropolis. The town is inhabited by the natives of the province, among whom may be reckoned 400 families of the Kajar tribe, the reigning family of Persia ; but here, as in all Asiatic towns, it is impossible to form a just idea of the population; as the num ber of indmduals composing a family differs widely, according to the rank and consideration of its head. During the winter the weather is generally mild, though damp and unhealthy, but the heat in summer becomes intense ; ‘ Rnd at that season the governor with about 200 of the richer inhabitants retire to their summer houses, situated among the mountains on one of the roads to Tehran. There are three caravanserais adjoining the lazars. The lattsr are meanly built and in some places in ruins. The streets were all originally paved, probably by Shah ’Abbas when he made the cause way ; and though they have doubtless been occasionally repaired, the present condition of the principal thoroughfare is very dilapidated. They are partly broken up ; and the channels by which the water used to run off being thus interrupted, pools are formed which become larger every day by the loosen ing of the adjacent stones. Some of the less frequented streets are in better order, and the paving sound, though uneven. There are neither ancient nor modern_buildings of any interest. The palace of the Governor, originally built by Agha Muhammad Shah, consists of several audience halls and other apartments, st 11 m good repair ; the principal of which, though now spoilt and half in ruins, was at one time yearly decorated with gilding and paintings.

In April 1912 the Russian military authorities bought a large tract of ground, about a mile square, 3 miles from Astarabad, on the road to Shahrud, commanding the Kuzluk pass, where they intended to build barracks. All the district is covered with dense forest, but this si e had 1 een almost en tirely cleared. Toe Russian Consul, M. Ivanow, had also bought a large tract of valley, containing two villages, on the slopes behind Astarabad.

East wick says the most curious thing to be Seen at Astaiabad is the amlar or prison a place about 10 feet square, in which Turkomans, when taken, were kept before execution. In one corner of this den were piled at the time of his visit 41 human heads stuffed with straw. The garrison of the Astarabad town consisted at the end of the year 1894 of 500 infantry soldiers, 60 artillerymen and 3 Austrian and 9 Persian guns. Some 40 or 50 petty merchants, residing at Astarabad carry on a trade withThe surrounding provinces. Some of it is in transit to Meshed, and the “ shals ” and “namads ” of the Turkomans are sent to Tehran, and from thence to all parts of Persia. The remainder seems to be almost entirely confined to the consumption of the town and neighbouring villages.^ The imnorts from Tehran are European manufactures, chiefly English a. silks and velvets from Kashan—from Russia, cloth, iron, glass, hardware whited boxes loaf-sugar, prints, chinaware, and. a very small quantity of La • from Khiva ox hides and various skins ; from Meshed, a^few cloaks and other manufactures; and from the Turkomans, “ namads,^ 'dials, salt, horses fndLphtC The exports are: soap, of which a greadeal is manufactured here and goes to aU the neighbouring provinces ; oil of sesamum and the see , to Russia and the neighbouring provinces, are also usedintffi manu facture of soap ; “ sldls ” and “ namads” in transit to Ml parts of Persia an 1 In Russia • manufactures of Kashan and British goods m transit in s:= ‘ — is derived from taxes on shops.

On the coast they have a fishery, which is frequented by Russians only, who pay to the Governor of Astarabad 100 iumans annually for the liberty. Seven or eight small ships are employed in this fishery, which consists of sturgeon, from which they extract the caviare. The most direct route from Baku to India would pass by the bay of Astarabad. This gulf in its shallowest parts has a depth of at least 14 feet, and is therefore accessible to ships drawing 10 feet of water. All parts of the coast from the village of Saluka northwards to the river Kara Su, and even farther, are suitable for the establishment of landing stages for troops. The climate of Astarabad is, as statistics show, very unhealthy ; but the fatality that exists may be chiefly attributed to the faulty construction of the houses, to the indolent and filthy habits of the inhabitants, to their gorging themselves in the season with unwholesome fruits, such as water melons and green figs, and to their habit of using water from the gutters that flow from house to house, gathering an ever-inceasing absorption of abominations. The temperature inside the British Consulate from April to the end of October 1881 varied from 100° as a maximum to 49° as a minimum. It is probable that troops located on the heights overlooking the city to the south, or in gardens inside the town, would have no unusual amount of sickness, provided all needful sanitary and dietary precautions were observed. Water-supply from 2 qundts and the Ab-i-Khwaja Muzaffar. The difference between Astarabad and Meshed in November is very great. In Astarabad orange and lime trees are in full fruit, and the oaks only have not yet shed their leaves. The sun by day is hot at times, and yet, a few hundred feet up, the hill sides are all covered with snow. The country is wonderfully green all round, and, though the town is deep in mud, the temperature is pleasant, and were it not for the mud the place might be an agreeable winter residence. A telegraph line connects Astarabad with Tehran. From Astarabad there is a telegraph line to Ak Kaleh and another to Meshed-i-Sar, but these are purely local Persian lines. There is another to Chat and so to Russian territory. (Kinneir ; Fraser', Chesney', Holmes', Stuart; Monteith; East- wick; Napier; Baker; MacGregor; Lovett; HExploration; C.

ATAK, DAMAN-I-KtH, KUPEH-I-DAGH, or KURIN DAGH— The Atak is the name applied to the mountains stretching from Kizil Arvat on the north-west, to Sarakhs on the south-east (which forms the north-east frontier of Persia), as also to the long, narrow tract of country on their outer side, the skirt or fringe of the mountain. Thus Kariz, Askhabad, and Gavars are equally included in the Atak with Darreh Gaz and Kalat districts, within the ridge which forms the boundary line. The Atak includes, therefore, the Akhal oasis ; and the Tekke Turkoman tribe are the chief inhabitants from end to end. The climate of the Atak is good and healthy, and the mountain sides have considerable forests in places. The Ataks of Kalat and Darreh Gaz are fully described under the article Darreh Gaz. The Atak was formerly Persian territory, but this is no longer the case. In 1884, after occupying the villages of Persian subjects lying on the northern bank of the river Atrak, and the villages and pasture grounds situated north of Bujnurd and Kuchan, Russia asked the Shah to appoint a Commission to fix the boundary line. Sulaiman Khan Sahib-i-Ikhtiar and General Raza Khan were sent to the northern frontier, and here they were joined by Colonel Karvoff from St. Petersburg. Work was commenced from Gurgan near Astarabad. The Persian Commissioners to their horror found that in addition to the pasture grounds, etc., which they had already occupied, the Russians had now advanced their boundary to the north bank of the most southern tributaries of the Atak, and were thus occupying all the small, fertile basins inhabited by Persians subjects from time immemorial. Again, starting farther east towards the hilly country, they found that the Russian officials had annexed not less than half the entire hill range lying north of Bujnurd and Kuchan. They represented this matter to the Shah, but were ordered to leave the Russian officials to do whatever they liked. Thus Colonel Karvoff fixed his boundary pillars just where he chose, taking over a tract of fertile country containing many large villages, viz., Nakhar, Kali Kaleh, Garmab, Galgun and Kalta-Chinar. Those Persian subjects who were Shi’ahs emigrated en masse, and thus thousands of people were rendered homeless. Further, without asking or consulting the Persian Commissioners, the Tsar’s Government occupied the following villages lying north of Darreh Gaz and Kalat-i-Nadirl Unao, Gavars, Baba Durmaz, Karan, Khusru, Khisran, Hisala Sukhti, Agla,54 ATA—ATR Darreh, Pislitalv (ruins), Bavard (ruins), Kakhka, Dushakh, Mihna and Cheh- cheh. It is true these villages are inhabited by Kara Dashni, Amrall, ’Alili, Akhal and Merv Tekke Turkt mans, but they were Persian subjects up to 1884 and used to give one-tenth of their produce to the Persian Government. Further than this, the Russians forcibly occupied the lands lying on the northern slopes of the Kalat-i-Nadirl defile. These lands were tilled by the inhabitants of Kalat-i-Nadiri, but are now in possession of Tekke Turkomans .—(Fraser ; Petrusevitch ; C. Stephen ; Schindler.)

Ateh BAl— One of the sections of the Chfini tribe of Yamut Turkomans, inhabiting the tract between the Gurgan and Atrak rivers and numbering 350 tents.— (Thomson) Yate.) ATRAK— A river to the north of Khorasan. It rises near the village of Tabarik, about 17 miles east-nor’-east from Kuchan, in a small stream coming from the direction of the Kuh Kamas hill, and pursues a westerly course to the Caspian, into which it falls at Hasan Qull Bay after a course of nearly 300 miles. From its source to a spot near Shirvan called Kara Qazan (the Black Caldron), the bed of the Atrak is for a considerable portion of the year dry ; hence its true source has been sometimes assigned to this latter place. When Connolly crossed it in April, some 15 miles from its mouth, it had a breadth of about 40 yards, and a depth of 3 feet. In the spring its banks are overflowed, and the Turkomans sow melon and jangan * in the alluvial soil. From the Chat-i-Atrak, the point of junction of all the principal tributaries to the sea, the river has a course of about 80 miles bending towards the south and away from the outer range. The fertile plain, between it and the Gurgan river, lies on one side, varying in width from 50 to 30 miles, and on the other a wide expanse of barren desert stretches far away to the north. The banks of the Atrak are said to have none of the surpassing fertility of the Gurgan plain. There are pastures and patches of culti vation watered by canals from the Atrak, but not the spontaneous and luxuriant vegetation of the tracts farther south. The ruins of large cities testify, however, to the fact that the northern plain in former times supported a large population. The Sharif Yamuts inhabit the land on the right bank of the Atrak, and the ChunI Yamuts are located near its embouchure. * Halcus sorghum, Indian-col'n.ATR-ATR Mr. O’Donovan saw the Atrak from a point a few miles above Chat, where it is joined by the Sumbar, to its mouth near Hasan Qull. He says that until close to the delta it flows along the bottom of a steep sided ravine, varying in breadth from three-quarters of a mile to 400 yards, the banks being from 40 to 60 feet high. The bottom of this ravine is more or less flat; and in its midst is the river channel which winds very much, with a canal-like regularity of bank. This channel varies in width from 12 to 30 feet. Its ordinary depth is from 5 to 6 feet ; but there are very many places where it is much deeper. The sides of the river slope regularly at an angle of 45°, and owing to the slippery nature of the loamy soil there are only certain places where it is possible to bathe. The fordable points are at long intervals, and only exist from the latter end of August to the end of January. In April 1880 the river channel was quite full and entirely unfordable, except at one point about a quarter of a mile below Chat, where the Cossacks were in the habit of crossing in search of forage in the plains beyond. The infantry made use of a small raft, on which they ferried themselves to and fro by means of a stout rope stretched from either bank. The breadth of the river at this point was about 35 feet. Except at certain places, the river is inaccessible to four-footed animals; and over its greater extent to men also, owing to the perpendicular nature and great height of the sides of the ravine. All round the entrenched camp of Chat the ground is seamed and scarred by torrent beds, which nearly all disappear within 100 yards at the edge of the cliff, and, burrowing into the earth, appear again at its base in the form of caves. These burrows make the approach to the camp very dangerous; camels and horses being liable to fall through. On the northern side of the Atrak, immediately to the west of Chat, are a series of deep, steep-sided ravines, by which the winter rainfall makes its way to the river. The Sumbar flows straight through a ravine precisely similar to that of the Atrak, and its immediate channel is of about the same dimensions ; but it ordinarily contains much less water. In April, when the average depth of the Atrak was from 5 to 6 feet, the Sumbar, close to its junction with the latter, had little more than a foot of water, and one 'crossed it by an easy leap. The great size of the ravine, however, indicates that at times the mass of water must be very considerable. Notwithstanding the great depth to which both rivers have cut their channels, there is not a single pebble to be found ; the only solid matter, apart from the indurated clay to be found being fragments of ancient brick and white glazed tiles, and nodules of vitreous scoriae from the kilns in which they were made. Small as was the quantity of water in the Sumbar it was an almost insuperable obstacle to camels even when not laden. The water of the Atrak is, in summer, very brackish, and at all times much charged with suspended marl. A bucket of it allowed to stand for ail hour deposits over an inch of fine, yellow mud.56 ATR-ATR . I he water of the Sumbar is more aaline and charged with silt The troops procure water for culinary and drinking purposes from the Atrak above its junction with the Sumbar. ^ The great prevalence of scurvy at Chat was probably as much due to the use of this saline water as to the absence of fresh vegetables. At the junction of the rivers there is a constant eddy, and this has excavated a kind of basin some 40 feet wide and very deep. All along the water’s margin, and in the ravine of both rivers, the bush known as saksal (saxaul) grows in considerable quantities, and is the only fuel obtainable h or a long way above and below Chat, these bushes have been cut away by the troops, who are now obliged to use naphtha refuse (astatkl) for cooking purposes. Ordinarily, the current of both rivers is about half a mile an hour ; but when flooded, the stream has the rapidity of a mill race. Judg ing jrom the watermarks in the ravine outside the regular channel, the Atrak must sometimes have a depth of from 25 to 30 feet. pl ace called Baiat-i-Haji, the third station along the Atrak from Chikishlyar, the ravine has its greatest dimensions, being over three- quarters of a mile wide. Here it forms an immense, irregular amphitheatre, with masses of earth standing like islands in its midst, between which the river zigzags. At Yaghi Ulum, the next station, the ravine is very wine and the sides are much torn by torrents. At Gudri, the second station from Chikishlyar, the ground suddenly falls towards the west, and the ravine opens out and gradually merges into the plain towards Dalih. From Dahli to the point where the Atrak enters the lagoon of Ha^an Qull the distance is about 25 or 30 miles. From laghi Ulum to Gudri the course of the river is nearly due south, but at the latter station it turns to the east. Formerly, about 5 miles from the lagoon, it turned northward, entering the latter nearly opposite Hasan Quli. Now it bends to the south, and skirting the edge of a long, low hill known as the Dangir Tappeh or Guklan Tappeh, flows into the lagoon one-third of its length from the southern extremity. The Russian staff map marks one of its old positions ; for there are many channels across the delta. The efforts made by the Russian working party, under Colonel Shelkovinkov, to turn the river northward by destroying the dam at the ford near Gudri, .have been entirely unsuccessful; the only result being the formation of a couple of marshy lakes at Dalili and Boiunbash, the water of which is unfit to use owing to its stagnation and the decaying vegetable matter which it contains. Owing to the amount of water absorbed by these marshes, and the quantity drawn off by irrigation canals to the Turkoman corn-fields, the Atrak, within 2 or 3 miles of the lagoon, is greatly diminished in volume. At the point where the telegraph line passes, it is 3 feet deep and 30 feet wide. Entering the agoon it turns slightly northward and reaches the sea by a passage half a mile wide between the two land spits, which, running nearly north and south, seperate the waters of the lagoon from the sea. Shortly after entering the lagoon the Atrak becomes unfordable.ATT-AZA 5T According to the Akhal-Khorasan Boundary Convention of 11th—23rd March 1882, the course of the river Atrak serves as the frontier between the possessions of the Russian Empire and Persia east of the Caspian Sea, between Hasan Quli Gulf and Chat-i-Atrak.— [MacGregor ; C.

A large number of families of the Baliich tribe are said to have been moved by Mahmud of Ghazni from Baluchistan to Sistan, whence they were brought to Khorasan by Nadir Shah and Karim Khan Zand. They num ber about 3,000 families at present, and are scattered in the Meshed, NTshapur, Juvain, Sabzawar, Turbat-i-Haidari, Turshiz, Tabas, Jam* Bakharz and Khaf districts. Besides these there are still several thousand families in the Sistan and Kain districts, where they are under the local governors. The Baluchis in Khorasan have no tribal chief at present, except the headmen of differ ent sections of the tribe. The Baluch families in the Meshed, NishapSr, Juvain, Sabzawar, Tur bat-i-Haidari, Turshiz, Tabas, Jam, Bakharz and Khaf districts are not under the local governors. They have a separate governor of their own, who is generally one of the subordinate officials at Meshed, and is changed every year by the Governor-General of Khorasan. These Baluchis altogether pay an annual revenue of tiimans 8,000 in cash, 2,616 Jcharwdrs of grain (f wheat and £ barley) and 667 kharwdrs of chopped straw. The Baluchis in the Turbat-i-Haidari district number about 1,300 families, and pay a revenue of 3,700 tumdns per annum.— {Maula Bakhsh.) BAM— Elev. 5,250'. A large village containing about 500 families of Bughiri Turks, the head-quarters of the Bam-Safiabad district, situated between two ndlds, a distance of 3 or 4 miles from the foot of the Shah Jehan mountain, 42 miles from Chaqaneh, 12 miles from Fathabad and 17 miles from Safiabad. Water good. Supplies procurable.—(C. E. Yate.)BANDAR GAZ.— Bandar Gaz has 20 large Armenian shops, 8 offices of carry ing and trading companies, and 100 other shops. There is a customs wharf or pier, made of wood on piles ; this is 440 yards long, 6 yards wide, 3$ yards above sea level. It cost 2,000 iumans to build. There is another pier of the same description, built and owned by the Ashraff petroleum company to land the pe troleum brought by their steamers from Baku. This pier is 435 yards long, 4 feet wide, 7 feet above water level. The petroleum is taken from the steamers by large tank lighters to the pier head : it is then pumped into a tank at the pier head, and is carried on shore by a pipe which runs the whole length of the pier. On account of the shoal water, steamers anchor a verst off the two piers. Two large cargo lighters are always kept moored at the steamer anchorage; these lighters are 50 yards X10 yards. These lighters are used to load and unload the steamers : the goods being actually brought on shore by 10 large boats belonging to natives of Bandar Gaz. These last boats measure 18x6x2| yards, carry 500 yoo ’s, cost 600 roubles : they are kept moored close to the customs pier. A mail steamer from Baku calls once a week, one or two cargo steamers also generally call every week. The Ashraff Company has a petroleum reservoir here with a capacity of 60,000 poo 5 . In Bandar Gaz the petroleum is put into 5-pood tins for transport inland. Exports from Bandar Gaz to Russia consist mostly of wool, cotton and dried fruits. | Turkoman boats bring salt to Bandar Gaz from Chikishlair and return with various goods. These are decked sailing boats: 25x8x3| yards, they can carry 1,000 poods or 100BAL—BAM 70 #• BALOCH— Baliich nomads are found wandering almost all over Khorasan. They are most numerous in the Turshiz, Turbat-i-Haidari, Khaf, and Kain dis tricts. They even visit the camps of the Ja’afarbai Yamuts, and travel to , the Gurgan and Atrak rivers. They also communicate with their brethren in Baluchistan. Wherever they wander, they have to pay revenue to the Persian Government.

Its elevation is between 5,000 and 6,000 feet.— (Stewart.) BAMRUD or BAMRUD— Elev. 2,900.—(tf. D. Napier). A fortified village in Khorasan situated in the valley between the|Bamrud Hill and Ahangaran range. It is of considerable size, and contains probably about 600 inhabitants. It is 44 miles east of Kaln on the road to Ghurian, and 96 miles from the latter. Outside the fort there is a lofty mosque, partly in ruins. There is a small canal of water which is brought from the neighbouring mountains (Khwaja Shaz), and which never dries up. The water is slightly brackish. The annual production of grain is about 1,500 kharvdrs, of which about 600 kharudrs are surplus and are exported to Chahrakhts and other villages in the Zir Kuh district. Rates : wheat, 2 maunds; barley, 3 maunds ; kali, 20 maunds, per krdn. Fuel and grazing plentiful. There are 1,800 sheep and goats, 50 donkeys, and 100 cattle. Mdlidt is 190 tumdns. There are 20 families of Bahluri mdlddrs who own 3,000 sheep and goats at 1 farsakh from here. In winter they go to Pusht-i-Kuh-i-Bamrud. There is a service of 12 Savdrs, who are paid at the rate of 200 krdns each per annum. Not a single tree is to be found here, and a strong wind prevails. There is a customs station here under the Rals-i-Gumruk of Turbat-i- Haidari .—(MacGregor ; Stewart ; H. D. Napier ; ’’Abbas 'All, 1907.) BAMSIPAND— A village of Khorasan, 80 miles from Nishapur, on the road to Damghan- — (Kinneir.) BANDAR-I-GAZ— A village 32 miles from Astarabad. It is the principal port on the south-east coast of the Caspian, and consists of a few houses and shops, built out of packing cases, and a pier. General Maclean, writing in 1889, says the length of the pier is 300 meters and its width about 8 feet. At its sea end there is enough water for boats of several feet draught. The large Turkoman three-masted boats come alongside to unload. The structure seemed firm and in good order, and would make a good landing place for troops, and for guns, if L ngths of wood were laid along the sides to pre vent the wheels slipping over. The road between Astarabad and Bandar-i-Gaz is covered with deep and adhesive mud, and is cut up by canals without bridges. It would be next to impossible for a force to march from Gaz to Astarabad in the present state of the roads ; where there is no mud, there are forests, rice fields and impassable bramble hedges and thickets. There is a Persian Government telegraph office. Post Office and Custom House. The village of Gaz, which is in the Anahzan sub-division, is an hour’s distance from Bandar-i-Gaz, or “ Kinareh,” as it used to be called. There are 5 or 6 Armenian families at Gaz, some of whom own wool and cotton presses, 80 houses, 150 shops, 4 caravanserais and 3 public baths.?2 BAN- BAN There is a Russian Consular Agent from Lankaran at Bandar-i-Gaz and a Russian telegraph clerk. Tne Persian Foreign Office is represented by a Sarhad Idr. Mr. Rosenblum opened a bank here in 1907. Tne Caucasus and Mercury Company have an agent. In summer drinking water has to be fetched from Kurd Mahalleh.—(Aapier; MacGregor ; Maclean ; Astarahad Trade Report, 1909.) BAND-I-DUKHTAR— A dam in Kalat-i-Nadiri, Khorasan, which stretches across the Kaleh river near the village of Nafta.— {MacGregor.) BAND-I-FARIMAN or BAND-I-FARlDUN— A dam in Khorasan, 7 miles due south of the village of Fariman {g.v.). It is advantageously situated between two hills composed of a hard stone, which confine the valley through which the stream enters the plain of Fari man. The dam was built hundreds of years ago and was repaired by the late Hakim-ul-Mulk (poisoned at Rasht in 1903). On his death it passed by purchase to the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, the present Atabegd-Azam. Its dimensions are : total length, [366 feet; length of actual dam, 160 feet; height, §0 feet. Foundations sunk to a depth of 28 feet. The width of the masonry, which is faced on both sides with brick and filled in with boulders set in mortar, is 20 feet. There are two sluices for water, which escapes by a single channel with also a flood channel. At the back of the dam is a huge buttress. The quality of the work can only be described as iair.—{Sykes, 1905.) BAND-I-GULISTAN— The band, situated about a mile below the village of Gulistan, is built across a narrow, rocky gorge at a bend of the stream, and consists of a substantial structure of large, burnt brick, some 50 yards across from rock to rock and 15 yards in width at the top, with a perpendicular face some 40 or 50 feet in height. There is a curious well built of blocks of cut stone to take the overflow of water through an arched channel at the bottom. Out side this, again, is a circular flight of steps permitting people to ascend and descend when there is no water flowing down the well, as is the case at present. The slight stream in the river-bed goes underneath the band and emerges through a sluice at the other side. Water is only held up during the spring floods. At other times the place is dry. The band is said to have been constructed during the time of the Safavian dynasty, and the water collected by it belongs to the shrine at Meshed.—(C'- E. Yate.) BAND-I-NASIRl— A dam near Sangbast, about 24 miles south-east of the town of Meshed, in the Nasiria or Sangbast sub-division of that district, built about the year 1860 A.D. by the Husam-us-Sultaneh, Governor-General of Khorasan, and called after Nasir-ud-Din Shah. It receives and collects the waters of the hills of the Sar-i-Jam and Turbat, and discharges the same for purposes of cultivation into the Jimabad plain.—(A/aw/a BakhsL)BAND-I-SALlMl— An ancient dam, now partly mined, about 4 miles north of Salami, a village 15f miles from Khaf to the west of the road to Turbat-i-Haidari- It is said to be over 50 yards in length, about the same in thickness at the base and 20 yards wide at the top, capable, if repaired, of holding up water sufficient to irrigate 100 ploughs of land. Such water as is now held up by the band is used in the autumn for sowing the crops. A small quantity of supplies can be obtained from a few houses on the bank of the tank, which is about a mile in circumference, when full. The band and its lands have recently been purchased from the Shah by Amir Bahadur of Tehran, who intends to keep it in repair. There are the ruins of an old town called Sabah in the vicinity, where gold coins have been found.—(0. E. Yate; Wanliss, 1903 ; Watson, 1906.) BAND-I-TURUQ— A masonry dam constructed across the stream rising in the hills to the south-east of Turuq {q.v.), and emerging into the Meshed valley at that village. The dam is situated some 6 miles up stream and west-sou’- west of Turuq, and although somewhat out of repair, holds up a large volume of water. Its dimensions are—height, 60 feet; average width, 27 feet, with one buttress 18 feet wide; length, 270 feet. The dam is reached either from Turuq by a difficult track—much of which is in the stream-bed—involving the passage of several narrow gorges, or from Meshed direct by an easier path over the plateau formed by the hills to the south-west of the city. It is the property of the shrine of the Imam Riza.— (Redl, 1906.) BAN! KAFUJ— A tribe of Arab descent in Khorasan, inhabiting the neighbourhood of Tabas and Tun. BANl KAZD— A tribe of Arab descent in Khorasan inhabiting the neighbourhood of Tabas and Tun. BAN-I-MID— A clan of Baluchis, numbering about 300 families.

The ruins are between Zurabad and Burj-i-Qalich Khan, about two miles from the latter. At Ban! Tak is a fine plain which in older times was irrigated by a qandt. Soil of the low hills is said to be excellent. The Timuris say that wheat of fine quality was formerly grown by them as rain crops. The pass is called Bani Tak from a high peak west of Burj-i-Qalich Khan, at the base of which goes a drivable road to Mahmudabad. It is situated between Burj-i-Qalich Khan and the village of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. Its top is 9f miles from the former and about 11J miles from the latter. The ascent is easy, and height by aneroid 5,000 feet (probably 200 feet lower). 48 I. B. K74 BAQ—BAR The Nusrat-ul-Mulk drove in his carriage over this pass in autumn, when he went to meet the Prince Rukn-ud-Dauleh at Zuiabad. It is, however, not quite fit for wheels in its present state, the path being narrow in many places and cut up. Gradients on both sides are easy, and the sod soft and easily worked. The pass presents no obstacle to construction of cart road or railway. The other pass which goes to Mahmudabad is said to be even easier.—(MacAeaw, 1888.) BAQ BAQU— See BAGH BAGHU— BAR— A sub-district of Nishaphr, with 15 villages and several hamlets, and a population of about 2,000. Its principal place is Bar.

It trends in a north-westerly direction, and con nects the elevated tablelands of Sar Bisheh and Alghur with those of Bajistan of the Tabas and Tun district. Its eastern slopes drain into the Kaln valley, where its several streams form a considerable rivulet, which flows past the town to the eastward.—(BeZZew.) BARASH (Stream)— A stream in north-eastern Khorasan, which rises in the Jam mountain, at Sar-i-Chashmeh and flows into the Kashaf Rud, 1 mile west of Bagh Baghu. It has not a continuous flow, and there is generally only water in places where there happen to be springs. Towards the end of its courso it flows through soil impregnated with salt, which gives a saline taste to the water. The river is bounded by low hills. The road from Sarakha to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam runs along the valley.— (Oranoffshj, 1894.) BARAZ-I-KANLt}— A section of Kurds of the Za’afaranlu tribe of Kuchan settled in the Sar-i- Vilaiat and Kuchan districts .—(Maula Bakhsh.)

It has about 100 houses, and an abundant water-supply from a hill spring. r It is surrounded with fruit gardens, poppy beds, and corn fields.— (Belleiv.) BARBARI— The local (and, probably, correct) term for Hazaras {q.v.) as they are called in India. As it is, to some extent, the badge of a conquered and persecuted race, when out of their own country they prefer to call them selves H-izaras, but the Hazara, as known in Persia, is an Afghan of the Afghans, and very different to the Mongol type of Barbari. Many new villages have been formed of late years round Meshed by Barb aria, who are an industrious people. Just as the “ Hazara ” in India frequently undertakes coolie work, so the “ Barbari ” in these parts under takes any work he can get. They now number in Khorasan 30,000 and are said to be gradually eating out the Persians. Barbaris are Shi’ahs and Hazaras (as known in Khorasan) are Sunnis—• [ReAl, 1909.)

A village containing about 30 families of Tartars and 10 of Jalairs on the road from Meshed to Kalat-i-Nadiri, about 16 miles from the latter place. Water in two springs, one slightly brackish, but not sufficient forT6 BAR—BAR irrigation, the crops being entirely dependent on rainfall. Supplies pro curable. They live by grazing large flocks of sheep and goats ; for their fields produce, at all times, light crops. Shut in by high mountains, except to the north-east, with an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet and a poor, stony soil, it is surprising that any population should be able to subsist. But the Kalat valleys on the north and the higher part of the range are said to have a population of 8,000 or 10,000, who, in former days, taxed the efforts of the most powerful rulers of Khorasan to subdue them.— (Napier ; MacGregor; C.

Bijistan is in a valley ; the mountains surrounding it consist of mounds of basalt, granite, metamorphie rook, green rock, slates, and yellow and red sandstones. Drift stones of every description and saline deposits are found in the watercourse ; good-sized bana trees, together with smaller plants of rhubarb, absinthe, broom, tulips, and lilies, are seen about the hills. Barley, wheat, opium, and silk are produced in fair quantity. The district suffered fearfully from the famine of 1872 by death and emigra tions. The villages are, for the most part, well watered, and their fields fertile.

The chief village of the buluk or sub-division of the same name belonging •to the district of Tabas in the province of Khorasan. It is situated 77 miles south-west of Turbat-i-Haidarl and 93 miles north-west of Kain, and is the third stage (33 miles) from Tun on the road to Meshed. It contains about 1,500 houses surrounded by gardens and has a popula tion of some 7,000 souls (Rozario says only 2,000). It has also a ruined fort, a ruined caravanserai, 4 hammdms (baths), 9 water-mills, 20 mosques and 200 shops. It is famous for the manufacture of a very costly species of a baraJc cloth made of goat’s wool, and of a cheap silk material called Chadar-i-Shah, which 'are exported to all parts of Persia and are much esteemed. Large quantities of apples, figs and other fruits are grown in the gardens north-west of the town, and the place is celebrated for its excellent water melons and abundant fruit. Four large qandts supply it with water. The remains of an ancient qandt are still to be seen, of which the tradi tion is that it was built in the time of the Safavi kings, and that whoever drank of its water became mad. Its situation is at the base of a bare hill running east and west for 3 or 4 miles, and the position of the city is indefensible, it being commanded by higher ground east and south within all ranges. The annual outturn of grain of Bijistan is estimated by Lieutenant Vaughan to be 6,000 Jcharudrs (wheat and barley) which is insufficient for local consumption ; wheat is therefore imported. The villages possess 300 cows, 3,000 sheep and 400 donkeys.— {Stewart ; MacGregor ; Rozario ; Vaughan ; Napier ; H. M. Temple.)

BUJNURD (No. 1) (District)— The Chiefship of Bujnurd now consists of the following districts' Bujnurd, Incha, Simalqan, Maneh, Jajarm, and Isfafain. Gurgan, inhabit ed by Guklan Turkomans, has recently been transferred to the Governor ship of Astirabad, owing to the Bujnurd Chief having been unable to enforce his authority over them. The present arrangement has not, hotv- ever, proved any more successful, as the Guklans are now ydghi (inde pendent), and pay no revenue at all. Their independent attitude has been rendered possible by the fact that th y are now on friendly terms with their neighbours, Ysttmts. The districts of Bam Safiabad and Juvain were formerly under the rp , . , , , Chief of Bujnurd, but they have been severed from the chietsmp and placed under separate governors. Jajarm and Isfarain might also be excluded from the chiefship at any time, at the pleasure of the Governor-General of Khorasan. The plateau or basin in which stands the town of Bujnurd is situated. Bujnurd. about the centre of the chiefship, and is enclosed by a knot of the principal mountains of the central section of the Eastern Elburz. It has an area of 80 square miles, is level in the centre, and rises on all sides in ravine-cleft slopes and rocky glens,_ to the summit of irregular, but everywhere high and difficult, ridges #BUJ—BUJ S3 To the north 7 o* 8 miles of impracticable ground intervene between ihn plateau and the Garma Khan, a tributary of the Atrak. North-east is a high peak known as the Akhir Kuh-,,or “ last mountain, ” so called because westwards and northwards as far as the outer Atrak ridge and Karl Kara there is nothing visible but a wide expanse of comparatively low, broken country, formed of ridges and plateaux cut up by innumerable Maneh and Simalqan. ravines. From the base of this peak north- ,, + ,, west the fertile valley of Maneh descends to the Atrakv Westward, across the mountain barrier* lies the wide plateau of Simalqan, broken by many deep ravines* reaching to the Atrak from the base of the Kurkhud peak. South and south-west rise the lofty mountains, Aleh Dagh, Kuh-i-Saluk, and Takht-i- Mirza, beyond which is the plain of Isfarain and Juvain. West of Aleh- Dagh is the prominent Kurkhud peak, and along the base of both moun tains stretches the plateau or plain of Shaughan, draining south, and extending to Chandir and the Gurgan. The plateau of Bujnurd has a height of 3,200 feet. Maneh, Simalqan and Shaughan are lower, but all have an equally fertile soil and ample water. The mountains, for the most part of limestone and trap, afford good pasturage and often wide tracts of arable land, bearing good crops of wheat and barley. They are well-wooded on their northern slopes with juniper. To the west a thin forest of deciduous trees extends up the valleys. The plain of Isfarain and Jajarm is parched and arid in the extreme, and could under no circumstances support a large population. The soil is* however, alluvial and fertile, and well repays irrigation where practicable. This plain drains west and south past Jajarm into the Kal-i-Shur, and thence to the kavir. It is divided from Juvain on the south by a low range of hills. The plateau of Bujnurd itself is so enclosed by mountains and so R situated, that no important road, either com mercial or military, will ever pass through it. The valley of the Atrak and that of its tributary the Garma Khan, are absolutely impracticable as a highway through the chain of Elburz, and the routes north to the Atrak, described in a previous report, are such as would be avoided by traders or by modern armies. A route that may at some future time have importance passes from Bustam through Jajarm and Isfarain, in the. south of the chiefship, to Meshed ; and the old trade route to Gurgan traverses the plain of Isfarain and the plateau of Shaughan. The mass of the population of Bujnurd are, as above noted, Kurds of p the Shadillu tribe, who inhabit chiefly Bujniird opn a ion, itself and the frontier villages of Simalqan and Maneh. The chief of Bujnurd estimates their present number at 15,000 families. Seven per cent, of the population are Turks. The town of Bujnurd has 1,500 houses, chiefly of Shadillu ; but there are also a few families of Za’afaranlu, political refugees, and of Tajiks and Turks driven by famine from other districts. On the plateau and in the hill-skirtsBUJ—BUJ 89 ater. goad psof lopes S !1|) we, id so lorn- : Ii it.' are Itlie has are also 13 villages, with a population of 1,200 households almost entirely of Shadillu Kurds. The valley of Maneh has 10 villages and hamlets, with 300 households of Shadillu, and a few families of Turks. The Simalqan plateau has 12 villages, with an aggregate of 400 houses of Shadillu and Garili Turks. Up to a compar tively recent date there were also in this portion of the chiefship a number of nomads of the Guklan tribe ; but the acquisition of Kara Kala, in such close proximity, by the Akhal Tekke, forced them to descend to the Gurgan plain, where they still remain in political con nection with the Ilkhani of Bujnurd, who collects their revenue on the part of the Government of Astarabad. The Guklans in the Gurgan number about 2,000 families at present. The Shaughan plain, with the hill-skirts about it, has five villages and a number of hamlets or kalehs with about 400 houses. Jajarm, which must formerly have been a place of some importance, is now in the last stage of decay. A miserable village of 500 houses only remains amid the ruins of what must have been a considerable town under Arab rule. There are also 3 small hamlets, Juvar, Darreh and Garma, making a total of about 900 houses. The people are entirely “ ’Ajam ” or Persian, which is strange, as the name of the town and all the ruins visible are certainly Arab, and there is in the neighbouring district of Bustam a large mixture of Arab blood. In Isfarain the principal village is Mianabad, containing about 700 families and about 50 small villages and hamlets. The Chehar Deh Sankhas sub-division contains several villages. The chief village, Sankbas, has some 300 families of Persian-speaking people. The Shadillu Kurds were transported to this frontier from the west by Shah ; Abbas at the end of the sixteenth century. The disastrous famines of 1872 and several previous years that ruined the agriculture and dispersed the population of other parts of Khorasan. Condition ot the population. , , * i., n -j. a. j c ^ ^ brought wealth and prosperity to the Kurds of Kuchan and Bujnurd. Their grain-crops, lying for the most part at a con siderable elevation, and sheltered from the burning wind of the southern deserts, are independent of irrigation. Though lighter by reason of the want of seasonable rainfall, they were still sufficient to feed the people and many thousands of immigi ants, and to leave a large balance for exporta tion. The Ilkhani of Bujnurd cited as an evidence of the improved condi tion of his people, that the number of women in the town had been doubled by importations during the famine. Young girls from the distressed dis tricts were sold by their parents to the Kurds for a few loads of grain. The peasants also of the outlying villages have laid by money and increased their stock of household goods. There was certainly every appearance of prosperity ; the villages teemed with infant life, and all classes were well clothed, fed, and housed. The tracts lying south of the mountain chain Isfaraln and Jajarm, had suffered somewhat, but there had been few deaths, the destitute having found food and shelter among the Kurds. With the exception of Isfarain and Jajarm, the valleys included in the Chiefship are green and fertile, and would be capable of supperting a far 48 IB M \ u-; r- &gt;\larger population than they do at present. Dry seasons are unknown, but the country was visited by locusts in 1903, 1904, and 1905, which caused a famine resulting in some deaths. The conditions obtaining during the Khorasan famines, when it is reported that women were sold to the Kurds of Bujnurdfora few loads of grain each, were reversed during these years, and numbers of Kurdish women and children were sold to the Turkomans. In this way about 2,000 persons are said to have been sold into slavery, but a still larger number of people left the country in search of food, and went to other parts of Persia and Russia, few cf whom ha v e since returned. The total annual out-turn of grain of the Bujr urd district is estimated at 27,840 amws. Of this 20,840 khanvdrs are required for Iccal con sumption and about 7,000 Jchartvdrs are available for export. Of the latter about 4,000 kharwdrs are exported to Russian territory, and the rest to the Tehran pilgrim route, for stages between Sabzawar and Shahrud to Jajarm, and to the Guklan and Yamut sub-districts of Astarabad. Isfaram is estimated to produce about 14,400 kharudrs annually, and the amount available, after the consumption of the people, is about 6,000 khar wdrs, which is exported to Sabzawar and to the Tehran pilgrim route for stages between Sabzawar and Shahrud. The annual produce of Jajarm is estimated to be 3,200 kharwdrs only. This is insufficient for its own requirements, and it has to import about 2,000 khancdrs annually from Bujnurd and Simalqan Agricultural Products .—Cotton is grown in Simalqan and Maneh, but the chief centre of cultivation is Isfarain, whence it is exported by Armenian traders to Transcaspia. Saffron seed was imported from Blrjand by the late Chief, and for a few years its cultivation was very successful, but for some reason or another it has now been abandoned. Grapes of numerous varieties, and apples are extensively grown. Raisins are grown and exported to Transcaspia, but in smaller quantities than from the neighbouring district of Kuchan. .Walnuts grow wild, and are similarly exported. Other fruits grown include almost all vanities found in Khorasan. The poppy is extensively cultivated, and the juice smuggled into Russian territory. Minerals .—Copper ore is found near Khairabad. There are signs of the mines having been worked in ancient times, but they are not worked at present. Coal is found in large quantities around Bujnind and in Isfarain. It has been used by the Chief of Bujnurd as fuel in his green houses, but owing to the extensive forests in the hills, wcod is so cheap that coal mining does not pay. Lead exists in Isfarain, but the mines are not worked. A beautiful species of marble is quarried near Bujnurd, specimens of which, let into the walls as tiles, and also used as table tops, can be seen in the Chief’s palace. An excellent sand is found in Bujnurd for glass making. Trade .—There is a good bazaar in Bujnurd. Foreign trade is mostly in the hands of a few Russian Armenians, who import cotton piece-goods, mmeni oil, sugar, iron, etc., from Transcaspia.BUJ—BUJ 91 h«. Exports consist of cotton, hides, gilims (carpets), raisins, walnuts, grain, fruit, poppy-juice, and silk. There are a few Muhammadan Russian subjects resident in Bujnurd, who are engaged in buying cattle for Transcaspia, and more come over during the summer months for the same purpose. Sericulture .—A Greek (Ottoman subject) named Dimadi, who lives in Bujnurd with his family, imports seed from Constantinople and dis tributes. it in the different districts of the Chiefship. The arrangement made is that the villagers take a quarter, and Dimadi three-quarters, of the net produce of cocoons. The climate of Bujnurd is said to be suitable for sericulture, but, owing to want of care, the out-turn of silk is poor. Owing to famines, Dimadi has lost money in recent years, but he is in hopes of recouping himself and extending the cultivation to Gurgan and the Ramian and Gumb \d-i-Kabus districts. He has a small silk factory in Bujnurd. Transport Animals, Cattle, and Sheep .—The following is the estimated number in the Chiefship :— Horses 2,000. This includes horses belonging to the savdrs maintained by the Chief, of which the supposed number is 700. Camels 2,000. Sheep 50,000. The number of cattle and sheep was considerably reduced during the recent famine year Customs Posts in Bujnurd.—There are customs pests at the following places:— Khanabad, Robat, Kaifan, Mlanzau, Meshed-i-Ghulaman, Raz, and Khartul. The Customs officials at the above places are all natives of the country. There is no European in charge, the Chief Customs Officer’s duties being carried out_by the Post-Master. The force at the command of the Ilkhani of the Shadillu consists of about . . , 700 horse. Of these about 100 men are very wclh Gavah- 068 ° f Bu ^ mir mounted, armed with Berdan rifles and dressed in cava ry. imitation of Russian Cossacks. Some few of the chief’s own retainers have good English and Russian “ double barrels. The remainder are scattered over different parts, chiefly in Manch and Simalqan. The wholn 700 men, if armed properly and disciplined, would form an admirable body of light cavalry, ready and able to ride over any ground, having the most perfect command of their horses and great endurance. Their horses are, strangely enough, all obtained from the Turkomans. There are not more than two or three dozen mares in the chiefship. Pasturage is insufficient for large numbers, and the stock is entirely in the hands of the Turkomans, whom nothing will induce to part with a good mare or stallion. All the remounts required by the Shadillu are procured from the Guklan and Yamut Turkrmans. This force of 800 men is stationed in detachments on the Atrak, at Maneh and Simalqan, at Shaughan, and at Bujnurd. They are mostly natives of the district, and for the most part stationed in their own villages,, forming thus a species of mounted militia or yeomanry. Besides rent-free M.2-0 4b 92 BUJ-BUJ lands, they have a small assignment of grain in lieu of pay, and a share in the profits arising from each successful expedition against parties of raiding Yamut Turkomans in which they may be engaged. Their horses and arms are supplied for the most part by their chiefs. In addition to this body of cavalry, there is a force of 300 militia footmen Footmen ^khani’s disposal, who are regularly enrolled, and paid by grain assignments. They are armed either with swords or guns of native manufacture. Their chief duty is to guard the roads across the Atrak valley that are open to the Turkomans ; but they are not pushed forward beyond Simalqan, or its last village, Kalehd- Khan. According to the Chief’s own statement, there are 2,000 breech loading rifles in the country. There are no guns. The Shadillfi tribe may be further reckoned as able to turn out at the bid ding of their chief about 3,000 armed men. The villagers are almost invariably of fine physique, armed with good guns of native make, and accus tomed to a life of almost constant warfare. The people of the outlying tracts may, in fact, be regarded as always under arms ; for they have regular picket duty on the mountain passes leading into their valleys^, and are fre quently summoned to aid in repelling attacks, or to join the Ilkhani in his raids on the Turkoman “ obas.” On these occasions their duty is to stop pursuit by holding the heights on either side of the glen, which the mounted body may select for their retreat. Jajarmis an intermediate post between Bujnurd and Nardin, and has a body of 100 to 150 horsemen and two light guns a J arm - under the command of the Ilkhani s deputy, who has also charge of the town and three villages. The horsemen of Jajarm are of various tribes, and equally well armed and equipped with those of Bujnurd. The duties required of the Ilkhani, with h's force of 800 horses and 300 Positions to be guarded foot, are in the first place to cover the districts in his by the Ilkhani. rear, Bustam, Sabzawar, and Juvain ; and for this purpose it is necessary for him to watch and close on the first alarm all the passes from the right flank of Nardin, i.e., from T _. , | | the Murtaza ’AH Maidan to the Darband-i-Hisar or jarm ° Chardeh, a line of about 40 to 50 miles in length. There are in this distance four passes practicable for a large number of Weak point of the horsemen, and many paths over which a few men may line. scramble with difficulty and by stealth only. The whole line from the flank of the Nardin line of posts to the Chukal mountains is left to the men of Jajarm, whose Chukah. numbers are insufficient to do more than give timely warning of danger. The three passes, Gudar-i-Kuhsar. Tang-i-Kazi, and Dehaneh-i-Gulbin, can be passed by horsemen for the most part at speed, and are consequently taken by the larger plundering bodies, who are able to defy any efforts of the weak detachment usually in the fort of Jajarm. This is therefore the weakest part of the whole border liE.© cBUJ-BUJ 03 The passes to the east, round the flanks of the Kuh-i-Behar, are guarded c, , - , , by a detachment at Shaughan ; and for seven or eight Shaughao border. ^^ ^ ^ of | urkomans has been ab , e 8 to pass that way. The line of uninhabited country from Shaughan, right round by Simal- qan to the Atrak, has also to be guarded for the ujnrn oi er. protection of the Bujnurd villages ; and this task is naturally most efficiently performed by the Shadillu, aided as they are by the impracticable nature of their country. The Ilkhani is expected to keep in check the Yamuts on the Gurgen Offensive duties of and Atrak. This being a most profitable service is Shadillu. also very efficiently performed, though it has hitherto had little effect in checking incursion into those parts. Lastly, the Guklans are “ under the skirt ” of the Shadillu, who aid them when too hard pressed by their enemies the Yamuts. In case ot very pressing need, the Bujnurd force may be reinforced from three different directions. The Ilkhani has the right Supports. demand reinforcements from the horsemen of Nardin and the Hazara and Tlmuri sai drs who are under the orders of the Governor-General of Khorasan. He may also demand assistance from the chief of the Za’afaranlu. This, however, is seldom done, and only on occa sions requiring the collection of a large force. Telegraphs.— There is a single line between Kuchan and Bujnfird, running via Shi van. The line is in better repair than the majority of Persian lines. Roads. The country is practicable everywhere for baggage animals, and tracks run in every direction. The only road by which wheeled artillery could enter the country is that by Kuchan and Zubaran. Consular Agents.— -There are no British or Russian Consular Agents in Bujnurd. The Russian Agent in Kuchan, one Pasha Khan, a Caucasian Muham madan, has additional charge of the Bujnurd Consular district. He visits Bujnurd once a year, remaining there for a month or two. The Chief's Family.—The late Ilkhani, Yar Muhammad Khan (Sahm- ud-Dauleh), who died in 1904, had a very large family, said by Colonel Yate to number 74. The following is a list of the most important members :— , (1) Nasratullah Khan, by a Guklan Turkoman slave girl, now aged 30, holds rank of Mir Panj. Sulaiman Khan, by the same mother, married a daughter of the present Karguzar of Meshed, by whom he had two daughters. Was murdered by his father in 1897. ’Azlzullah Khan (Salar-i-Mafakhan), by the Ilkhani’s principal wife. Presentchief of Bujnurd. Aged 26. Married daughter of Yazir-i-Nizam, now Commander in-Chief at Tabriz. Also holds rank of Amir Tuman. (4) Habibullah Khan (Shuja’-ul-Mamalik), by the same mother as the Chief. Aged 22. Holds rank of Amir Tuman. Is nomi nally Governor of Isfaraln. Married sister of Shuja’-ud-Dauleh, the deposed Governor of Kuchan. ( 2 ) (3)94 BUJ-BUJ (5) Daughter married to son of VazIr-i-Nizam. (6) Daughter married to Shuza-ut-Taulieh of Meshed. Also nine other sons and three daughters. Ten or eleven siga, widows of the late chief, are supported by the present Chief, who spends 7,000 tumdns a year on their maintenance. The late Chief had only two regular wives, one the mother of the present Chief, the other died childless and bequeathed her property to the Imam Jumeh of Meshed. Disputes regard ing the bequest are still' going on. Recent Events in Bujniird .—The late Ilkhanl murdered his eldest son Sulaiman Khan, in 1897, in consequence of which act he was summoned to Tehran, and_ heavily fined. He was also deprived of the district of Gurgan. The Ilkhani made a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1900, and visited France and Russia en route, in the latter country being accorded unusual honours. He was accompanied at the start by his son, Shuja’-ul-Mamalik, but for the latter the attractions of Paris proved more potent than the calls of religion, and he returned without having set foot in Arabia. The Ilkhani brought back with him the electric plant with which the palac&amp; is now lighted, and a good deal of expensive furniture. The old Chief died in 1904, and was succeeded by his third son, ’ Azizullah Khan. His eldest brother made some attempt to enlist the sympathies of the people on his own behalf, but was unsuccessful. He was appointed for a short time to the Governorship of Jajarm, but was subsequently recalled. On his accession, the Salar is said to have paid tumdns 30,000 to the Shah, 5,000 of which was for Isfarain. Tumdns 15,000 of this amount came from his own treasury, and the remainder was borrowed from the Russian Bank. * In 1904, after his father’s death, the Chief was summoned to meet the Sipah Salar (Amir Khan, brother of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh) at Shahrud, and on payment of a sum of tumdns 8,000 the Gurgan district was restored to&gt; him, and he was also given the title of Salar. The Chief was shortly after summoned to Tehran. During his absence, Nasratullah Khan made an attempt to obtain possession of Isfarain, and the Asaf-ud-Dauleh, Governor-General of Khurasan, took the opportunity of handing over the Governorship of Isf rain to Muhammad Ja’afar Khan, a nominee of his own. The Salar then proceeded to Meshed, and by payment of a considerable sum obtained the recall of Muhammad Ja’afar Khan. He&gt; afterwards appointed his own brother, the Shuja’-ul-Mamalik, to the post. In 1904 theGuklan Turkomans were instigated by their priest, Qilich Ishan, to refuse the payment of revenue ; in consequence of which the Chief took a force into Gurgan to exact payment himself. The Guklans, however, had made up their differences with the Yamuts, and, being joined by the latter, were able to defy the Kurdish savdrs. Some fighting took place without much damage being done to either side, and the Chief, seeing his forces were inadequate to coerce the Turkomans, retired to Bujnurd. A Persian commissioner was appointed to enquire into the matter, and Gurgan was eventually separated from Bujnurd and put under the Gover nor of Astarabad. So far, however, the latter has not been any more- successful in obtaining the payment of revenue.BUJ—BUJ 95 In the last month of last year (October 1905) a raid was made by Yamiit Turkomans on Sirazu and Takmaran, two villages of Sarazubis, situated near the Bujnurd frontier, in the Kuchan district. Ten men were killed, and 63 women and tumans 40,000 worth of property were carried away. Amir Khan, the Asaf-ud-Dauleh s son, who was at the time Governor of Kuchan, was dismissed by the Persian Government in consequence of this raid. A number of relatives of the captives went to petition the Shah and beg that steps should be taken to recover the captives. The course taken by the Tehran G overnment in the matter has been to hold the Chief of Bujnurd responsible for the raid, and to insist in his making reparation. For the purpose numerous Ma’murs have been sent successively to Bujnurd, each of whom has departed somewhat richer than he came, but without any other result. The most recent of these was in Bujnurd in October ; he had instruc tions to demand that the Chief should lecover the captives by force, buy them back, or else present himself at Tehran. Political note. Charges against the C^e/.—Mention has already been made of the raid by Yamut Turkomans on Kuchan territory, which took place in 1905. Further particulars of this affair are as follows The Yamuts numbered about a hundred. The route taken was along the northern bank of the Atrak, by the villages of Khartut and Katlish. The people selected for attack were pastoral Kurds living in encampments in the Sirazu and Takmaran valleys. Ten men were killed and 63 women and girls carried off, besides animals and property valued at tvmdns 40,000. One Turkoman was killed. The raiders returned by Shah-u-Chagh, Sulukli, Raz, Meshed-i-Ghulaman, and Khartut, but avoided the posts at the above villages. The Governor of Kuchan at this time was Amir Khan, who had been appointed to the post by his father, the Asaf-ud-DauPh, Governor-General of Khorasan, when the Kurd Chieftain Shuja’-ud-Dauleh was removed. The raid was taken to reflect on his capacity in the difficult position of a Persian Governor of a Kurdish tribe, and he was retired. The Asaf-ud- Dauleh then accused the Salar-i-Mafakhan of having planned the raid in order to discre At Amir Khan and obtain the reinstatement of his kinsman, the Sh ja’-ud-Dauleh. A number of people at the same time went to Teh an (some say at the As J-ud-Dauleh’s instigation) to represent their case. The Mullas of Tehran and Karbala interested themselves in the matt n and the Shah sent a Ma^mur to Bujnurd to insist on the Salar’s recovering the captives. The Salar pleaded innocence and his inability to comply with the order. A Md’mur of Turkeman extraction was then smt to investigate and report on the occurrence. The Salar state* that this report was favourable—no doubt he paid for a favourable report—others say that he condemned the Salar. Other Ma’murs have been sent since then. One Sarhang Haji Ali Abbas Khan was at Bujnurd in 1906. His instructions were to call on the Salar to recover the captives by force, to buy them back, or to present himself at Tehran. The demand, as the Sarhang said, practically signified dismissal from the Chiefship, as the recovery of the captives was out of the questionwith the force at the Salar’s disposal, while his treasury had been depleted by the numerous demands made on it since his father's death, and would certainly be unequal to paying a ransom, if this was otherwise practicable. (It does not seem to have occurred to the Persian Govern ment what an extraordinary confession of weakness and incapacity the suggestion of ransom coming from them amounts to.) The question oE whether or no the Chief was guilty of complicity in the raid is one that it would be impossible to answer without a c .reful sifting of the evidence on both sides. Many people believe that he was at any rate cognisant of the raid. It is ev n affirmed by some that the Yamuts were led by certain Turkomans settled in the Simalqan valley. Others scout the idea of the Chief’s personal knowledge of the raid, but say that his sawars at the frontier posts must have connived at the escape of the raiders. An old man of the Kuchan district, who apparently had no in terest in the matter, said it was impossible for a Slu’ah to send his co religionists into captivity among Sunnis, or for a Kurd to abet the capture of Kurds by Turkomans. The question of the Chief’s guilt or innocence, however, does not present itself to the Persian mind as one of any practical importance. It is suffi cient that he has been accused, for everyone, from the Shah to the Ma’mur, who conveys his orders, to seize the opportunity of squeezing him. It is not unlikely that the Central Government also sees in the occurrence a pretext for carrying out, in the case of Bujnurd, what seems to have become their settled policy—the abolition of hereditary Chieftains. This, however, may be postponed till the Salar has exhausted his treasury and private means in the hope of keeping his State. In the meantime, the captives are in the hands of the Yamuts, and as the process of squeezing the Bujnurd Chief is more in accordance wilh Persian tastes than meddling with well-armed Turkomans, they seem likely to remain there. The geographical position of the Chiefship would seem to mark Russia as the Power to whom the Salar would more naturally look for help than ourselves, but he seemed to mistrust Russian motives. Though he frankly admitted that he was on friendly terms with the Russian authorities at Gumbad-i-Kabus, he evidently resented very keenly their interference with his cultivation on the Atrak, and he was under the firm impression that the power of the Yamuts was chiefly due to the superior weapons which they have been allowed to obtain from Russian territory, and to the protection afforded to them by that Power. Water Dispute with Russians .—Colonel Yate visited the northern part of Bujnurd in 1897, he mentioned the village Kharaqi, on the bank of the Atrak, as having been recently populated. He remarked on the number of old water channels showing former cultivation, and added that if the fear of the Yamuts was removed, there was no reason why these tracts should not be cultivated again, “ unless, indeed, Russia stepped in and prohibited further cultivation on the plea of there not being sufficient water for her Turkoman subjects lower down.” This is, in fact, what has happened. Cultivation was extended round Pishkaleh, Mamgaglu, and Gazabad till 1899, when Russian Cossacksappeared and destroyed the band on the Atrak. The late Chief was suspected of having been paid to say nothing, but the Karguzar at Bufnurd made objections, with the result that orders were sent from Tehran to restore the band. This was done. In 1902, however, the place was visited by the Russian Commissioner from Gumbad-i-Kabus in company with the Ihtisham-ul-Vazara, and the latter conceded the Russian demands, since when the cultivation has been abandoned. The Chief assured me that there was no cultivation by Russian subjects lower down the Atrak which could suffer by his people using the water, and that he had made representations to Tehran on the subject, but with no result. Boundary Dispute with Kuchdn .—About 30 years ago, a party of Kuchan Kurds immigrated to the Isfarain frontier and founded three villages, the largest of which are Muhammadabad and ’Aliabad. Since this time they have been paying revenue to the Chief of Bujnurd. The villages are claimed by the Governor of Kuchan on the ground that the inhabitants are Za’a- faranlu Kurds, and he has recently sent word to the Katkhudds of the dis puted area, to pay revenue to Kuchan. The Bujnurd Chief has, on the other hand, issued orders that revenue collectors are to be turned out by_force. Claim against the Chief by Imam Jumeh .—The widow of the late Ilkhani named Laka-us-Saltaneh died in 1905, and, being childless, bequeathed her entire property, valued at tumdns 150,000, to the Imam Jumeh of Bujnurd. The legality of the deed is disputed by the Chief. The Imam’s claims are, however, supported by the priests in Meshed, and the Governor-General has recently despatched a Md'mur, the Muzaffar-un-Nizam, with some 70 savdrs, to take possession of the property and hand it over to the Imam Jumeh. Claim by Muntakhab-ul-Mulk, Kdrguzdr of Meshed .—When the Muntakhab-ul-Mulk was Karguzar at Bujnurd, his daughter was taken in marriage by the late Ilkhani’s son, Sulaiman Khan, who was subsequently murdered. By the marriage deed an estate, known as the Kaleh-i-Biar, in Bujnurd is said to have become her property. The Muntakhab’s claim is for this estate and its produce up to the present time, also for a main tenance allowance for Sulaiman Khan’s widow. The Muzaffar-un-Nizam, now in Bujnurd, has orders to settle the case. Nusratullah Khan.—When the Salar obtained the Chiefship on the death of his father, Nusratulkh Khan, his elder half-brother, was made Governor of Isfarain. He was, however, relieved of the charge very soon after. During the present year (1906) he came to Meshed, and orders were obtained from Tehran appointing him Governor of Isfarain. The Asaf- ud-Dauleh in the meantime had received inducements from the Salar to allow matters to stand as they were, and the latter appointed his younger brother to the post. Since the Chief has been in trouble over the Kuchan raid, there has been some talk of Nasratullah Khan being given the Chiefship, but although he has a certain number of supporters, he would not have a sufficient following to be able to carry on unless his brother were deported. The Sahm-ud-Dauleh, his uncle, the late Ilkhani, was a man of so much influence that he enjoyed a better position than his power, resources, and. 48 I. B. Npersonal ability could have earned for him. His grandfather, Najaf ’AH Khan, died in imprisonment in Tehran. The annual revenue of the districts under the chief of Bujnurd is as follows :— Cash. Kind. S ~~ Crain § wheat, i barley. Rice. Chopped straw. Tumdns. Kharvcdrs. Kharwdrs. Kharwdrs. Bujnurd . 13,900 , 2,251 Isfarain . 4,330 \ 4,531 500 1,780 J&amp;jarm . 1,555 J •• 400 Total 19,785 4,531 500 4,t31 Since the days of the Ilkhani Jasar Quli Khan, the Gulden tribe has been under the direct management of Bujnurd, and the influence of the Sahm- ud-Dauleh procured him an accession of authority. The tribute, or revenue, due by the tribe is collected by a Deputy of the Ilkhani,jwho lives at Chaqur, the chief settlement of the Guklans. The cavalry of the tribe are also under his orders, and he has authority to coerce and punish offenders. The revenue of the Guklans is fixed at 6,031 tumans 'per annum, and after deducting the pay and allowances of 200 sarars, who are kept up at a cost of about 3,000 tumans per annum, the balance is remitted by the chief to the Governor of Astarabad. In addition to the revenue shown in the statement, the Chief derives about 1,000 kharwdrs of revenue grain, and the Shuja’-ul-Mamalik about 450 Icharwdrs from private States. Nusratullah Khan also gets a return of about tumdns 1,000 from his estates in Garm Khaneh, Jajarm, and Bujnurd.

In Persian records generally written Buzinjird, perhaps originally Bizan- yurt, was founded about 200 years ago by Tuli Khan II on the site of the ruined Buzinjird. The town is picturesquely situated on a small and beautiful plain covered with cultivation, sprinkled with gardens and trees, and surrounded by mountains. The place may be described as a square, situated about 2 miles from the hill to the north, built round a mound on the north side, on which stood the former Ilkhani’s residence, called the ark. The place was surround ed on all sides by a very decent wall which no longer exists, and now Buj nurd is simply a large, open village with a long bazar in the centre, contain ing about 500 shops. The town consists of some 2,000 houses, all of mud with flat roofs, and a population of about 10,000 souls, mostly Shadillu Kurds with a small proportion of Turks and Tajiks. There are four gates—the Qibleh, on the north ; Kuchan on the east; Meshed on the south ; and the Gurgan on the west. There are four main streets : one, from the Qibleh gate, winds round the western face of the old citadel, and then goes south to the Meshed gate ; another, from the Kuchan gate, runs irregularly to the west, and ends at the Gurgan gate. Down part of the street leading to the old ark is a stream of water and some trees are planted, giving it a cheerful shade. The palace built by the old Ilkhani and the grounds and orangeries are well kept and in excellent order. The former is decorated with many hundred square yards of glazed tile work, and is well and solidly built in a style more European than Persian. The interior of the house indi cates similiar tastes ; a hall hung with old weapons, armour, and huntingtrophies; big reception rooms, in which is a good deal of cheap and showy Austrian and German ware of the kind that seems to attract the Eastern fancy ; a gun room, and so on,—the whole perhaps a little more elaborate than the size of the State and its resources would lead one to expect. It is said, indeed, that the present Chief was at first a good deal handicapped by the amount of money his father had spent on the palace and its fittings. The town has eleven Mahallehs which are as follows:—Shahr-i-Taza, Vasat, Darvazeh-i-Gurgan, Sultan, Masjid-i-Haji Muhammad Khan , Sarban, Sar-i-Mahalleh, Darvazeh-i-Kuchan, Shaikh Muhammad Taki, Haji Mulla Naki, Haji Mulla Ibrahim. There are four mosques and five public baths. The citadel having become ruined, the Governor, Yar Muhammad Khan, Sahm-ud-Dauleh, built himself a house outside the town in the garden of Yazdan Quli Khan, his father. Other fine gardens outside the town are Bagh-i-Dilkusha of Ja’afar Quli Khan, IlkhanI; Bagh-i-Amir Guna Khan, Bagh-i-Haidar Quli Khan, Bagh-i-’Ali Murad Khan, Bagh-i-Kahar Quli Khan, and others. South of the town and surrounded by fine old trees is the grave of Sultan Saiyid ’Abbas ibn-Musa-ibn-Kaziam. There is a post office and a Persian Government telegraph office in the town. The only manufactures are copper pots and striped silks as made elsewhere in Northern Khorasan, also woollen and silk socks, gloves and purses.— {MacGregor; Schindler; C. E.

It consists of some 800 houses, and is surrounded by a circle of cultivation for a radius of about 3 miles. It is enclosed by a wall in the last stage of dissolution, and covers an area of about 500 yards by 400, the long side facing the north. There are four gates, one in - each face, and in the north-west angle is the ark or citadel, which, though rather imposing at a distance, has no importance whatever as a fortified position. The water is good and all supplies are procurable, though there is no bazar and no merchants. The only manufacture is barak, a soft, warm material made from the hair of goats. Though the place has much cul tivation, it could not probably export much grain without running the risk of a bad year, such as 1871, when it is said that over 1,000 inhabitants died. Bushruieh is the chief place of the buluk of the same name in the district of Tabas. The buluk consists of the following villages :—Aspak, ’Aliabad, Tarij, Rukha, Arishk, Murdistan, Deh-i-Nau, Khurramabad, etc. The revenue of the buluk is 1,500 tumdns ver annum.—(MacGreqor : Maula Bakhsh.)

BUSTAM, or BUSTAN (No. 2 )—(Town)— Lat. 36° 29' 20' ; Long. 55° 45' ; Elev. 4,630' — (Lemm). A town in Khorasan, 5 miles north-east of Shahrfid, renowned for the fertility of its soil, its good water, and excellent horses. The cotton goods of the locality are also held in much repute. The town of Bustam lies on a level plain enclosed by mountains distant from 4 to 10 miles, and is watered by a small stream and numerous qandts ; mud walls of some height, with a thickness of 6 or 8 feet at the base, and numerous flanking towers enclose it ; its circuit may be about 1| miles. The gateways are defended by strong towers of burnt brick. A circle of gardens and groves of “ sanpd ” (sweet willow) trees gives cover right up to the walls. Within the first wall is another, very thick and solid j there are chambers cut in its base to a depth of 10 to 12 feet. This second wall is not complete ; but the gaps are backed by irregular mud walUd enclosures, and it would form a very serviceable inner line of defence. In the centre of the town is the ark or citadel ; a square enclosure with substantial mud walls, and a good ditch of about 30 feet by 15 feet.The bazar and inhabited part of the town cover a comparatively small space near the arlc ; and the remainder of the enclosure is filled with strong walled gardens. There is space for a large number of men ; and the valley in ordinary seasons* would afford ample supplies of grain. In the square of the citadel were, in 1874, four old field guns. Bustam contains five baths, seven mosques and eight water-mills. The town is divided into four mahallehs, viz., —Mahalleh-i-Bazar, Mahalleh i-Rangrazan, Mahalleh-i-Sar Asia and Mahalleh-i-Kashaba. The road from Shahrud to Bustam goes through a level plain. Bustam is an important position ; for, supposing a Russian force were to be disembark ed near Ashurada, there is at present nothing to prevent its occupying the whole of Khorasan, whilst by seizing the important position of Shahrud-Bustam, they would cover their flank by virtually cutting: Persia in half. The Persians do not seem to recognize its importance, as scarcely anything has been done to protect it. There is plenty of water in the height of summer for a force of 60,000 men. The district is very productive, and it would be impossible to invest it, if properly fortified. Bustam is separated from Sbahrud by a bare, rocky hill. (Napier l MacGregor ?

A fortified village of considerable size in Darreh Gaz district, Northern Khorasan, on the road from Kalat-i-Nadiri, 8 miles south of Muhammad- abad, and divided from it by a low, rocky ridge. It lies in a plain at the foot of the main range, surrounded by small mountains, which separate it from the desert. In the middle of this plain is a spring; but the mam water- supply is derived from a rapid river which descends from the Quran Dagh range near Duringar, and then waters several villages and towns in the plains. It is defended by a good wall and ditch, enclosing a space of about 500 yards square. In 1872 the village was nearly destroyed by lekke Turkomans, of whom 3,000 horsemen and 2,000 footmen invaded the valley, sacked the village, forcing the gates and carrying off 1,500 o the people with all their goods and cattle.

'For a considerable part of the year, they are away in the Balkan and Misrian districts, and some of their camps move onto near Kizil Arvat and the Akhal country ; but they all return during the harvest season to the Atak and Gurgan districts for the pur pose of reaping and storing their gram. The Charvas remaining in or visiting Persian territory are estimated to be about 2,400 families. See ‘‘Yamut.”— [Thompson ; G. E.

The village of Astaneh is 1 mile beyond it. A stream flows from the spring, watering gardens and cultivation bordering the road. It is chiefly remarkable for the great volume of water that issues from one point, and the complete sterility of the Holy spring. valley and surrounding mountains, from which it is presumably fed. The discharge at the spring head was found to be at a rough calculation 100 cubic feet per second. The water is perfectly pure, having apparently no matter in suspension ; but it is credited with some healing properties, and is said to be especially efficacious in all skin diseases. Possibly the persons who resort to it would find the springs of their own villages equally so if more freely resorted to. A large tank shaded by a fine plane tree is filled from the spring, and contains a number of tench said to be sacred. These are said to be fed by pilgrims who come in thousands from Mazandaran, to which there is a good road. A building erected by the Shah on the edge of the tank might, if not occupied by some of the pious fraternity of tramps usually to be found hanging about such places, be available for any European travellers who chose to pay a small sum, and would be a most pleasant lodging in the summeer. Being at the junction of one of the main trade routes from Mazandaran and Astarabad to Shahrud and Damghan, and a route much used by pil grims bound to Meshed, the spring is visited yearly by large numbers of travellers, who usually halt a day to bathe in the stream and pay their res pects to the local idol —amark, v/hich those who are so inclined, believe is the impression of the foot of 5 All. The foot-print has been very neatly carved out on a block of stone, and is protected by a wooden railing from too close an inspection. CHASHMEH I-BlSH QARDASH— See Bish Qardash.

A spring in the Bizaqi sub-division of the Chinaran buluk of Meshed in Khorasan, 4 or 5 miles north-east from Gunabad and about 25 miles north-west of Meshed.CHA-CHA 125 At the foot of the hill to the south of the spring and just above it are the ruins of a large palace which was apparently built of stone and bricks. The spring issues from a picturesque rock at the foot of a detached sour of the northern range of the Elburz, known as Kuh-i-Radkan. The hill opposite Chashmeh-i-Gilas towards the south Js a spur of the Kuh-i- Daulat Khaneh locally known as Kuh-i-NIshapur. The spring has about ten sangs* of water which collects in a large basin, from 12 to 20 feet deep, made by an ancient dam constructed to raise the water to a high level and to divert it from its natural course towards the east or from the western channel towards the old town of Tus. Amir ’All Shi], the Prime Minister of Sultan Husain Baikara, who is famous for having constructed a large number of works of public utility during his lifetime, built a canal and made the water of Chashmeh-i-Giiaa flow through it to Meshed about the year 1490 A.D. The water was the property of the Persian Government at first, but was endowed to the shrine of Imam Riza by Shah ’Abbas about the year 1597 A.D. As the water does not run in a straight line, it is said to traverse aoout 48 miles before it reaches Meshed. After leaving the spring, it irrigates lands belonging to the village of Chashmeh-i-Gilas and then those of the villages Karajangal and Kalateh-i- ’Abdullah Khan. Lower down it is joined by a large stream from Band-i- Gulistan. A mile below the village of Amirabad the whole water is drawn off into a canal, which runs down to Meshed and flows through the main and central street and the shrine square, entering the town by the Bala Khiaban and leaving it by the Pain Khiaban gate, after which it runs down to Turuq. The water of Chashmeh-i-Gilas is so remarkably pure and clear that at the depth of 12 or 14 feet every stone at the bottom, except at the north eastern corner, which is overgrown with reeds and grass, is visible. The basin is full of fish and crabs which can be seen swimming about. The wa ter, however, is divested of all the purity of its original source, and becomes very muddy and dirty before it reaches the town of Meshed. The actual source of supply probably lies high up in the mountains to the north, and at least 15 to 20 miles distant. The village of Chashmeh-i- Gilas has a population of 50 families of Kurds who own 70 cattle and 300 sheep and goats and 10 horses. The annual production of wheat and barley amounts to 2,700 and 2,250 Indian maunds, respectively.—(Aaper ; Mania BaJchsh ; OranoffsJcy, 1894.)

No habitation. No supplies procurable.— (C. E. Yate.) CHASHMEH-I-SABZ (No. 1.)—Elev. 7,700'. A spring or little lake in a basin in the hills north-east of Nishapur in the Gulmakan sub-division of the Meshed district of Khorasan, 13 miles from Gulmakan, about 28 miles from Nishapur, and about 48 miles from Meshed. There seems to be no doubt that the lake is very ancient, and that it was much larger in former times than it is at present. A ledge of the former shore is still pointed out by old local guides, and it is said that the basin inwhich the lake is situated, and which is estimated by them to be about five thousand paces in circumference, was surrounded by hills on all sides, and was full of deep water which overflowed into the ravine leading down towards Gulmakan, but that the water forced out a channel between the hills, which reduced the level to its present state. The best road from Nishapur to Chashmeh-i-Sabz is via Buzan, about 12 miles, thence to the spring about 16 miles. The road from Gulmakan to Chashmeh-i-Sabz leads up the valley of the Chashmeh-i-Sabz stream the whole way. The distance, about 13 miles, is ridden over at a walk in about 4 J hours, but baggage mules take about 6 hours to do it. Gardens and plantations are passed for the first 3 miles, but beyond that there is nothing but a line of willows and wild briar along the bed of the stream. The ascent is gradual the whole way. St; rting at 4,600 h-1 from Gulmakan the ascent is roughly about 500 feet per 3 miles. For the last mile and a half it is steeper, but nothing of any account, it Chashmeh-i-Sabz itself is about 7,700 feet. At present consists of a small natural lake about 300 or 400 yards in length, and 100 to 150 in breadth, fringed with reeds, and with lofty mountains on west, south and east. The lake is fed by a number of springs, and about four sangs of water flow down from it to Gulmakan and irrigate gardens and lands belonging to that village. There are lots of chikor along the valley of the stream, and wild pig and wild sheep are said to abound. There are no habitations anywhere near Chashmeh-i-Sabz, and all supplies have to be taken up from Gulmakan. There are no tiees or shade, but plenty of good grazing and firewood can be got from the willow trees down the stream and the thorn plants on the hills around. The lake contains a lot of small fish of the same species as the common fish found in the rivers of the country. The highest point on the range of the hills in which Chashmeh-i-Sabz lies is probably over 11,000 feet. Colonel C. E. Yate went up to the top of the range. The height of the path along the main ridge or watershed of the range, where he struck it, was about 10,700 feet. He took his horse up the whole way without difficulty and says that along the top even camels can travel ; that they are brought up there by the nomads in the spring; and that one can apparently ride along the top of the range from one end to the other without any difficulty. Snow lies all the year round at seme places on the range, which is entirely bare of wood, but is covered with a round, dry thorn bush which burns freely .—(Schindler ; C. E. Yate; Mania Bakhsh.) CHASHMEH-I-SABZ (No. 2)— A small spring in Khorasan, 23 or 24 miles from Btizinbad, on the road to Rui Khaf near the Khaibar range of hills. It is a pasturing ground for shepherds of the Bahluri tribe, who have a camp near Buzinabad ; but they do not have their families here, as it is too exposed to Turkoman raids. A favourite Turkoman raiding road passes by here.

CHEHAR ’AMAQ (Khorasan)— The name given to the nomad tribes of the Herat district. _ _ Originally the Chehar ’Amaq tribes were four, t'.e., Jamshidi, Firuz Kuhi Taimdw, and Timuri; but at present at least six tribes are included in the above designation, i.e., Hazara and Qipchaq, in addition to the four first mentioned. _ # j * * The maiority of these people live in black goat s-hair tents, ana trust chiefly to their flocks and herds for their livelihood. Both in Afghanistan and Persia, however, some portion of the tribes are settled. ^ The most usual plan is to have a qisfildq or settled winter residence, while in the summer they wander about and visit their ydildq or summer quarters in search of pasture for their flocks.Timuri .—The Timuri claim to be descended from Mir Saiyid Kasim also known as Mir Saiyid Kalal, who was the descendant of Imam Jaiar Sadik, the sixth in descent from ’AIL His descendants remained about Herat, and became very powerful ; especially one Haji Khan. In his time the Timuti were settled chiefly in Badghls, north of Herat, between the Murghab and Hari Rud. A large portion of the tribe moved over from Badghis, and occupied Khaf and its district, which was'then Afghan. Amir Qalich Khan, Haji Khan s son, rose to great influence in Herat, quarrelled with Mir Hasan Khan, the Vazir of Shah Mahmud, and killed him ; seized the citadel of Herat, and declared himself a partizan of Shah Zaman, against Shah Mahmud. Ho gave up the citadel to Shah Zaman, and withdrew himself and the rest of his tribe to Khaf ; having gone to Tehran and visited Fath ’Ali Shah, he declared himself a Persian subject. The Timuri also occupied a large portion of the Sabzawar district of Afghanistan and remained there. They are very Arab-looking in features, though larger and coarser-mad© men. Their language is Persian at present. About 2,000 families of Timuri are said to be still in the Herat, Sabza war and Farah districts of Afghanistan. The Timuri in Khorasan number about 6,000 families at present. They are scattered in the Meshed, Jam, Bakharz Khaf, Zurabad and SaraBha districts, and are under Mir ’Ali MardanKhan, a direct descendant of Saiyid Mir Kalal. . Mir ’Ali Mardan Khan was first appointed Sarhang (Lieutenant-Colonef), but has gradually been promoted to be Sardar (General of the Ist^ class)- He was granted the title of Nusrat-ul-Mulk by the late ISasir-ud-Din Shah on the occasion of the latter’s first visit to Khorasan in the year 1867, for valuable services rendered by him to the Persian Government during the Turkoman raids on the Khorasan frontier. He was Governor of Persian Sarakhs in 1884, and has been Deputy Governor-General of Khorasan and Sistan several times^ He was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Shah’s forces in Khorasan at tho beginning of the year 1895. In September 1895 he was treacherously seized by the Shihab-ul-Mulk (now Asaf-ud-Dauleh), the then Governor-General of Khorasa i. and confined in a village 30 miles from Meshed. ^ As Governor of the districts adjoining the Herat frontier (Jam, Bakhara and Khaf), which he ruled for a long time, the Nusrat-ul-Mulk was most useful to the British Agency in Khorasan. He was always a friend ot the English and his fall was a blow to British interests in Khorasan. On the matter being brought to the notice of the^ late Nasir-ud-Dm- Shah, His Majesty found great fault with the Shihab-ul-Mulk lor his proceedings and censured him in severe terms, while the Shihab-ul-Mulk endeavoured to exculpate himself by heaping false charges aeamst the Nusrat-ul-Mulk. . , ,-i The districts governed by the Nusrat-ul-Mulk not only conta ned the bulk of his tribe, but were those in which British interests chiefly centred because they bordered on Afghan territory. It was in his capacity as Governor of these districts that the Nusrat-ul-Mulk proved himself so valuable a friend to the British. Government, and, what is remarkable lor a - * Rm CHE-CHE Persian official, he was able to act in concert with the British Agency in Khorasan, without in any way running counter to the interests of his country or failing in his loyalty to the Shah. Through the influence of the British Legation the Nusrat-ul-Mulk was afterwards, at his own request, summoned to Tehran by the late Nasir- .ud-Dm Shah. During the Nusrat-uI-MuIk*s absence in Tehran the Shihab-ul-Mulk tried to deprive him of the chiefship of the Tinmrl tribe, and to place it under Mir Asadullah Khan, but without success, as the tribe remained loyal to the Nusrat-ul-Mulk. The late Nasir-ud-Din Shah knew the Kusrat-uI-MuIk personally, and treated him with great consideration as being the only powerful chief in Klprasan who was loyal to his Government. His Majesty intended to send him back to Meshed, and to restore him to his appointment of Sardar (Com- mander-in-Chief) of the Khorasan Army and Governor of Jam, Bakharz and Khaf, as soon as possible. On Nasir-ud-Din Shah’s death, however, the Russians tried to bring pressure to bear on the Persian Government to prevent the Nusrat-ul-Mulk^s return toKhorasan, on the plea that he had a secret understanding with the English and was hostile to the Russians. The Persian Government yielded to this demand, but eventually, after the Nusrat-ul-Mulk had promised not to give offence to the Russians, in future, he was, on the recommendation of his father-in-law Rukn-ud-Dauleh (Muzaffar-ud-Dm Shah’s uncle, and Governor-General of Khorasap. and Sistan), allowed to return to Meshed in April 1898, to resume the 'chiefship of the Timuri tribe, without the Government of Jam, Bakharz and Khaf. He is now in mortal terror of the Russians, and is obliged to be on visit ing terms with the Russian Consulate-General and to keep away from the British Agency at Meshed. The Nusrat-ul-Mulk is over 60 years of age and has no sons. On his death he will probably be succeeded as Chief of the Tlmurl tribe in Khora san by Mir Asadullah Khan. Mir Asadullah Khan is the head of a section of about 300 families of Tiinuri at present. These Timu i are part of about 1,000 families who in 1858 emigrated from the Herat district under their chief Mir Attaullah Khan (father of Asaduliah Khan) and settled in Persia, being granted lands in the Kuh S-urkh district south of Nishapur. More than two-thirds of these, however, returned to Afghanistan. Mir Asadullah Khan received the rank of Amir Tiiman (Major-General) and the title of Shaukat-ud-Dauleh from the late Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1893. After the Nu-rat-ul-Mulk’s departure to Tehran he was appointed Governor of Jam and Zurabad, which districts are still held by him. He d d not, however, get the Government of Bakharz and Khaf, which were placed under different Governors. The Shaukat-ud-Dauleh is about 40 years of age (1898) and has two sons named Abu Turab Khan (aged 15) and Mirza Husain Khan (aged 4). He has Russian proclivities and is very anti-English. The Persian Government by their ill-treatment of the nomads settled on their border have alienated all the Timuri; and this tribe would undoubtedly welcome and make common cause with any invader, even the hated Afghan.Jamshidi —Are the next * Amaq tribe. Their head-quarters are at Kushk, 4:0 miles north of Herat. They were originally Persians ; but through con tinual contact with the Turkomans have lost nearly all trace of their Persian origin. They were a powerful tribe and had»mueh political influence, ai d had a good deal to say to Afghan affairs during the rule of Ya’qhb Kl.an and Aiyftb Khan in Herat. Owing to adverse circumstances, however, they have lost all their powerful chiefs and influence, and the number of their families in the Herat district, which amounted to about 5,000 in l&amp;Sd, has consider ably decreased, some having fled to Panjdeh and a number being scattered indifferent directions. The following is a brief history of this tribe During the reign of Shah Kamran the Jamshidi tribe _ numbered about 12,000 families, and were settled under their chief Zaman Khan, son of Kara Khan in the Badghis district of Herat. Mir Ahmad Khan, ’Abdullah Khan, and Mehdi Quli Khan, sons of Jabbar Khan, son of Mahmud Khan, who were Jamshidi headmen and cousins of Zaman Khan, were inimical to the latter. 1 From Badghis the Jamshidi migrated to Merv and afterwards to Dr^anj. About 2,000 families, however, remained and settled at Kurrukh. Khin Hazrat, the Amir of Urganj, appointed Mir Ahmad Khan chief of the Jamshidi tribe and conferred the title of Khan upon him. ’Abdullah Kh&amp;n was appointed chief of the Jamshidi in the Herat district, but he fled to Maimana, whereupon Allah Yar Khan, son of Zaman Khan, was appointed chief in his place. About this time disputes arose between the Urganji and Jamshidi tribes when Mir Ahmad Khan was killed. The Khan of Urganj then appointed Mehdi Quli Khan chief of the Jamshidi, and conferred the title of Khan iqa upon him. During the disturbances which arose in Urganj, Mehdi Quli Khan, who was anxious to return to his former residence, effected his escape and came to Andkhui. ^ Herat was then being besieged by the Persian General, Prince Sultan Murad Mirza Hisam-us-Sultaneh, who, acting under the orders of the Persian Gov ernment, persuaded 2,000 families of Jamshidi to migrate to Khorasan under their chief Allah Yar Khan, son of Zarran Khan, and settled them m the Sar-i-Jam district. After the Hisam -us-Sultaneh’s return from Herat the Jamshidi families who wete in Andkh&amp;i cattie to Herat and settled in Badghis their chief being Mehdi Quli Khan, Khan Aqa, who was after wards murdered by Sardar Aiyub Khan at Herat. His son Yalangtush Khan succeeded him, but he also was kilted by Amir ’Abdur Rehman Khan. The Jamshidi, who had migrated to Khorasan, remained m the oar-i- Jam district for about six months, but as the Turkoman raids were sequent in that district, they moved to Kaneh Gusheh and Karbakkeh near Meshed whence a large number of the families were gradually sent back to Herat by their chief Allah Yar Khan. The Persian authorities becoming aware ot this Allah Yar Khan fled to Herat. On his flight the remaining families were placed under the Rauti chief, Isma’il Khan. These families were then moved to Kushkaneh in the Kuchan district, where they remained with the Rauti tribe (described later on) for a few years. After that they were brought back to Kaneh Gusheh and Karbakkeh. In the mean time Allah Yar Khan, who was not pleased with the treatment which he R 21-32 CHE—CHE received from Sardax Ya’qiib Khan at Herat, fled to Meshed and was re instated as chief of the Jamshidi tribe in Khorasan. The Jairshidi were then about 300 families, but their number was reduced to 150 families by a famine which subsequently occurred in Khorasan. Allah YarKhan died at Karbakkeh and was succeeded as chief of the Jamshi li tribe by his son Zulfikar Khan. In the year 1885 one-half of the Jamshidi families were sent to Pas Karnar, and the rest also joined them there thiee years afterwards. At this time the number of the Jamshidi was reduced by deaths and other causes to about 80 families only, which is their strength at present. In 1889 Zulfikar Khan opened negotations with the Russians, whereupon he and his famlies were sent back by the Persian authorities in Khora san from Pas Kamar to Karbakkeh. Zulfikar Khan fled from Kar bakk&lt;h to Russ an territory, where upon his younger brother Muhammad ’Azlm Khan was appomted chief of the Jamshidi tribe. The Jamshidi tribe in Khorasan is now settled at Jalalabad and Jizabadnear Shahan-i- Garmab about 40 miles southeast of Meshed. Zulfikar Khan returned to Meshed and afterwards settled at Shurja near Pas Kamar, where he lives at present with a small number of families The Jamshidi in Khorasan have a service of savdrs 50. ^ Zulfikar Khan and his brothers Muhammad ’Azlm Khan and Raza Qull Khan receive allowances from the Persian Government. Zulfikar Khan is about 40 years of age. . _ About 50 families of Jamshidi fled from the Herat district to Rhora- gan in 1893, and settled at Ban! Tak in the Zurabad district under their chief SaTd Ahmad Beg, aged about 50. Sa’Id Ahmed Beg, however, committed an offence and fled back to Herat in August 1898, forcing the Jamshidi families at BanI Tak to return with him to Afghan territory. The Jamshidi have many horsemen and their cavalry is considered of good quality. Rautl. —The RautI, though generally considered a section of the Jamshidi tribe in Khorasan, is really a separate tribe. It derives its name from the Diravat district of Kandahar. About 2,000 families of this tribe originally emigrated from Dira vat to Herat, but owing to some misunderstanding between two sections of the tribe, about seven hundred families migrated i to the TaimanI country and joined the tribe of that name. The rest of the tribe settled in the Budghls district whence they were moved to Maruchak by order of Nadir Shah. There they intermarried with the Jamshidi. From Maruchak they migrated to the Karajangal hills, whence they were moved to the Kushk; neh district of Kuchan by order of Nadir Shah. After Nadir Shah’s death they migrated from Kushkaneh to Sarakhs and thence returned to Badghls. Ahmad Shah Afghan restored to them their old lands at Chehar Darreh, Shir Rud, and Kara Bagh, and conferred the title of Khan upon their chief Nadar Khan. Afterwards the tribe again migrated from the Herat district to Khorasan and settled at Zurabad whence they returned again to Herat and settled in Kushk. In the year 1857 the Rautl tribe, then numbering about 700 families, migrated from Badghls to Kuhsan, whence they were induced by the Persians to move to Khorasan. They were allotted lands in the Sar-i-Jam sub-district of Meshed where they settled, but owing to Turkoman raids they were obliged toremove themselves from there to Kaneh Gusheh and Karbakkeh, villages near Meshed. Their chief then was Ismail Khan, son of Allahehar Khan. Prom Kaneh Gusheh and Karbakkeh they were again moved to the Kush- kaneh district of Kuchan but again returned to Kaneh Gusheh and Kar bakkeh. They were then about 550 families, but this number was reduced to about 200 families by famine, which subsequently occurred in Khorasan, and other causes. In the year 1885 they were moved to Pas Kamar on the Kashaf Hud where they are settled at present. They now number 120 families only. On Isma’il Khan's death, his son HajI Muhammad Amin Khan, the present chief of the Rauti tribe, succeeded him. He is about 60 years of age. _ . , . He has a service of fifty savars, and he and his brothers Darvish All Khan and Qalich Khan receive allowances from the Persian Government. Firuz Kuhi .—This ’Amaq tribe now occupies the mountain country from Kaleh Nau almost to Maimana. The present chief is Bahram Khan. Kadis or Gadis is the chief seat of the tribe ; Bahram Khan being chief of this portion of the country as well as of the whole tribe. Chakhcharan is another Firuz Kuhi place. The local chief is Muham mad Khan, and he has about 1,000 families who follow him. The Firuz Kuhi are of Persian origin, having come, it is said, from Firuz Kuh in the Elburz mountains, not far from Damavand. TamdnI.—Less is known of this tribe of ’Amaqs than of the others. They are said to number 17,000 families, and are the most numerous of all the ’Amaq tribes. Their chief place is Tivara, south-east of Herat, where the chief of the whole tribe, Anbia Khan, resides. They are said be very uncivilized. The TaimanI are said to be of Turanian, not of Persian origin. A larger proportion of this tribe have settled habitations than the other ’Amaqs, and only a portion are nomads. Hazara .—After the last siege of Herat the Persian General, the Hisam-us- Sultaneh, Governor-General of Khorasan, moved about 5,000 families of the Sunni Hazara tribe of Kaleh Nau, the head-quarters of the tribe in the Herat district, to Khorasan. They were allotted lands in the Jam and Bakharz districts, and their chief, Yusuf Khan, was given the rank and pay of Sartlp (Colonel) with a service of a number of Hazara savars (irregular cavalry). After a short time about 2,000 families returned to Kaleh Nau, whereupon the Persian Government did not consider it advisable to leave the remain* ing families in the frontier districts. They, therefore, moved them to Isfaraln, where they remained for some years. From Isfaraln they weie moved to Kaneh Gusheh, a village near Meshed. In the year 1877 Yusuf Khan was appointed Governor of Bakharz, where he built the village of Muhsinabad on the Herat frontier, and settled a number of the families there. His son IsmaTl Khan remained with a number of the families at Kaneh Gusheh. Yusuf Khan died in the year 1885 and his son Isma’il Khan succeeded him. The Hazaras in Khorasan now number about 1,200 families and live at Kaneh Gusheh, Kana Bist, Kalateh Chinar and Muhsinabad, in the MeshedCHE—CHE ■and Bakharz districts. There are some families in the Zurabad districts also. Isma’il Khan is at present (1898) the chief of all the Sunni Hazaras m Khorasan and is about 52 years of age. He was made an Amir Tiiman ^Major-General) and granted the title of Shuja’-ul-Mulk by the late Nasir- fid-DIn Shah in 1894. t In 1896 he was again appointed Governor of Bakharz, which appointment he still (1898) holds. He lives at Meshed himself, and his brother Sartip Muhammad Raza Khan is Deputy Governor of Bakharz on his behalf. The Shuja’-ul-Mulk has a son named’Abdul Faiz Khan, aged 22 years. The other ’Amaq tribe, Qipchaq, is too far away from the Persian border to need mention in detail .—[StewartMaula Bakhsh ,) CHEHARBAGH.— Elev. 7,100'. A gipsy encampment, consisting of a tower and some enclosures, m the Astarabad district, between Chehar Deh and Ziarat, on the road to Astar- abad from Mazandaran. It is situated in a valley of the same name, hemmed in by the Lari and Lindi mountains to the north and by the Shah Kuh range to the south. The valley is reached by crossing the Quzluq Kutal at the head of the valley (north-west), and then descending from 7,600 feet, the level of the water parting, to 7,100 in the neighbourhood of Cheharbagh. The scenery changes as if by magic, and is very different from that of the Caspian provinces. The valley presents a dull, uniform, yellow ochre tint, mitigated by a sparse sprinkling of funeral-looking yews and hum mocks of heather and thistles. There is good water here and pasturage.

A small village in Khorasan, 10 miles from Tabas, on the road to Khur. Vaughan says : 17 miles west of Tabas on the western confines of the Dasht-i-Kavir. It contained only 50 houses in 1875, having suffered muchCHE—CHE 135 an, from the famine of 1871. There are gardens here and a good supply of sweet water. The whole country around is composed of sand , but, thanks to the water with which the sand is irrigated, dates are produced in great abundance, and a few other trees, such as mulberry and pomegra nates, are to be seen. Tobacco and grain are grown in small quan tities, and dates in very large quantities indeed, and exported to all parts of Persia. The names of the four villages from which the place takes it name are Jhqar, Targhinan, Tashkanan and Mihdiabad, con taining in all about 200 houses. Juqar, the largest of the four villages, contains an aggregate of 800 inhabitants. There are two caravan roads from here to Meshed ordinarily used by pilgrims—one by Bijistan, and the other by Nishapur, both passing by Tabas, at a distance of 10 miles. It contains a fine serai built of burnt bricks. It is about 80 yards square, exclusive of the outer court, which is about the same size, and through which access to the inner building is alone obtainable. It contains accommodation for about 250 men and 300 horses. It is strongly built, but has no flank defence. The roof has an all-round wall and a 5-foot parapet badly loopholed.

A group of four villages in Astarabad, north of Damghan, 12 miles north of Chashmeh-i-’Ali. They are situated in the midst of gardens at the foot of some high, rocky hills. Their names are Kaleh Tsh, Zirdamuks, Varasam, Harab-i-Deh. The revenue is about £25 in money and 40 Iharwars in produce, and they are bound to furnish 200 soldiers to the Government. Barley and wheat form the chief cultivation, which crops, however, occasionally fail on account of drought, when grain is importe d from Astarabad. The inhabitants of this village are exempted _from_ all taxes on condition of furnishing 300 men to the regiment of Damghan ; and in consequence of this immunity they are said to be very rich. The village is a great depot for mules, which are sold in Khorasan. The style of the houses and dress of the inhabitants areon the Traq model. A fine stream, coming from the snows of the Shah Kuh range, rushes through the villages, and is sub-divided and distributed by numerous side channels, conveying the water to the fields. They all have numerous walled gardens, with rows of poplar and willow trees and stunted mulber ries, and the inevitable imdmzddeh. There are a few mosques and a bath and’a public bakery—a great economiser of time—in which excellent bread resembling biscuits is made, by which means each peasant is not employed, as in India, in passing most of his time baking his own bread. Situ ated as this village is on one of the main trade routes with Persia, a number of mules are always kept up, and can be readily obtained at short notice. ™ t t ™ B —Lovett says that the Tang-i-Sar and Chashmeh-i- Ah valleys can be best observed from Chebar Deh.

DAMAN-I-KUH— 4-1. ° f i ^ un ^ ain ® on the northern frontier of Khorasan, also called the Atak and Kupeh Dagh. It begins at Kizil Arvat, near the Little Balkan mountains and extends as far as Darreh Gaz in the south-west. At its base to which all the rivers descend from the northern slopes, are all the villages of the Akhal Tekke. At the same time the frontier line of Persian settlements extends m almost a straight line from west to east as far as Sarakhs ; pro jecting, as at Kalat and Darreh Gaz, somewhat to the north. Consequently in the east, at Datreh Gaz, the Akhal Tekke and Persian settlements almost join ; while on the west they are about 132 miles apart. The whole of the triangle between the Persian and Tekke settlements is filled with spurs of the Elburz and Daman-i-Kuh range. Here are many beautiful valleys, once peopled and still showing signs of prosperity. The climate is exceed- in &amp;v good and healthy, and there is forest on the mountain sides, though not so much as in the province of Astarafcad. The mountains are not so rugged as those of Kalat and Darreh Gaz, and in many places there are pasturages amongst the slopes. The Atrak river has its sources in these moun- taii's ; The strategical importance to Russia of extending her frontier to this river consists in the security that the possession of the passes over the Daman-i-Kuh will afford to her communications, which, in case of a further advance eastward, must, except she obtain permission to pass t rough Persian territory, lead along the foot of the northern slopes of the Daman-i-Kuh, where water and forage are obtainable—(RefrwsmM; Intelligence Division, War Office, 1880.) {See also Atak.)

The cliffs on either side rise sheer out of the water to I a height of 200 feet, and are quite impracticable ; while the bends l of the defile present numerous excellent sites for forts. It can, however, be easily turned by infantry going to right or left over the hills, which are not difficult.— (MacGregor.) DARBAND-I-ARGHAVAN SHAH— A pass in Khorasan forming the southern entrance to the natural fortress of Kalat-i-Nadiri. There is a guard here of Persian Infantry, and there are a few villages perched on the ledge of the hill, mostly on the west. The water of the stream here is said to be unwholesome. In spite of a swift current, the gravel bed is-covered with a coating of loi g weeds, by which the water is slightly coloured. From the gateway, which has recently been erected, the road leads under the walls of a small, round fort, showing a couple of guns, through the village of Arghavan Shah,;and down a green, fertile valley with a good stretch of rice cultivation, to the village of Guk Gumbad, in which is the residence of the Khan of Kalat.

It lies on a river of the same name.— (MacGregor.) DARREH GAZ— Lat. between 36° 30' 0' and 37° 40' 0' ; Long, between 58° 30' 0' and 60° 20' 0'. One of the northern districts of Khorasan. The name is said to be derived from Dara or Darius, who is said to have founded the place. The great Nadir Shah was born in this district, and the house in which he was brought up still exists, it is said, in the town of Muhammadabad, the head-quarters of the district. This district, comprising a single, fertile valley and the mountains enclosing it, is the only Persian possession on the northern watershed of the Elburz, east of Astarabad, save a few small villages in the Kalat Atak. It has been maintained with very varying fortunes against the constant attacks of a powerful enemy, not by the weak, unsympathetic, and dilatory efforts of Government, but solely through the tenacious resistance of the brave and hardy tribesmen, who have clung to their fertile lands through every adversity, returning again and again with unconquerable persistence to their devastated homes and ruined fields and vineyards. Boundaries .—The boundaries are fairly well defined. The small stream rising in the Maidan-i-Khuni plateau, on the direct route from Meshed and Kuchan to Darreh Gaz, known as the Rud-i-Qibqan, and lower down as the Ab-i-Vard or Yart, may be held to mark the boundary line. There are no villages on the lower course of this stream, but its water, when it reaches the plain, is diverted to some of the Darreh Gaz Atak villages. From the Maidan-i-Khuni the southern and wester nboundary line of Darreh Gah runs along the main chain of the northern section of the Elburz, which divides it from Kuchan, and which is called the Allahu Akbar range, running from Hazar Masjid. It then crosses the Darreh Gaz stream above Duringar, and strikes north to the crest of the Atak chain, known there as the Kuh-i-Asalm (or Asalmeh). The northern boundary crosses over to the northernmost summit of the Asalm range, passing along its ridge in a south-easterly direction, and then skirting round to the north of the village of Kalateh Chinar, it runs to the point where the ZIrkuh and Kizil Dagh mountains join. Extending thence south-eastward along the summits of the Zir Kuh range, until it issues into the valley of the Baba Durmaz stream. It then takes a northerly direction and reaches the oasis at the road from Gavars to Lutfabad, leaving the fortress of Baba Durmaz to the east. Thence it descends to the border of Kalat-i-Nadiri. The tract150 BAR—DAR thus included consists of the southern slopes of, and spurs descending from, the mountains of Kuchan, or the Allahu Akbar Kuh, the whole , open'portion of the valley watered by the voluminous Duringar river, and the spur of the Atak chain enclosing it to the south. Its total length from east to west is nearly 40 miles, and its average breadth about SO miles, giving an area of about 1,200 square miles, of which it may be reckoned 400 square miles are level and more or less cultivable. I Plain. This plain or valley is one of the most-favoured spots in Khora- san. It receives the whole drainage of a valley 70 to 80 miles long, and is completely encircled by mountains rising at many points up to 7,000 and 8,000 feet in height. It has an elevation of 1,200 feet at Muham- madabad, a fertile soil, and fine pasturage. From the crest of the Allahu Akbar pass which overhangs the valley, 23 large villages, each with exten sive gardens and vineyards, may be counted ; and cultivation extends in an unbroken sheet from the slopes of the mountains on either side to the river banks. To the south-east and west the mountains rise to a great height and form an almost unbroken wall with short, steep, buttress-like spurs. To the north a chain of lower hills (the Kizil Baiar, an 5ff-shoot from the Daman-i-Kuh), rising, however, at one point to a considerable height, completes the enclosure. There is a gap in the west where the Duringar river enters, and another north-west, known as the Dehaneh-i- 1 ’Ishqabad, and a third north, by which the river joins the ocean-like expanse of the Kivan desert. , i i- n Darreh Gaz Passing through this northern gap and the low lulls confining it, the character of the country and soil changes at once. The soil becomes sandy and saline, and the hill slopes barren. The whole aspect of the landscape is arid, parched, and forbidding, save where the course of the river and the lands irrigated from it are chequered with culti vation, green pastures, and thickets of tamarisk {gaz), willow, alder, and thorny scfub. The villages lie along the border of the river, and to the right and left, to a distance of 8 or 10 miles from the hill slopes ; each one is a little oasis in the sandy desert. In the spring a green herbage, affording good pasturage, springs up, covering the plain wherever it is not already covered by shifting sands. The rice fields are 16 miles down the course of a small stream running towards the plain of Darreh Gaz. There are a few towers built for protection, but no fixed settlement. The crops used to be as often reaped by the Turkomans as by the lawful owners, but since the occupation of the Akhal bv Russia in 1881, and of other Turkoman districts later on, all Turkoman raids have ceased. The poor people of the Atak villages that have pass ed into Russian possession have certainly accepted Russian rule as a boon, as it has brought with it security from the constant attacks of their maraud ing neighbours—a security that their own Government was unable to give them There was not a house in the 20 Atak villages that had not lost some member killed or carried off into hopeless slavery. The price for which a man could be ransomed was from 25 to 50 tumans—a, sum far bevond the reach of the ordinary villagers. For the first few miles from the foot of the hills the soil of the Atak is poor and sandy. It is in many parts also saline and covered with salmeDAR—DAE 151 efflorescence. Farther out it becomes more fertile. The fertile belt extends from 4 or 5 to 16 and 20 miles, and is then lost in a sandy waste that extends to the Caspian and Aral. The Atak of Darreh Gaz belonged to Persia, and was ruled by the Persian Governor of Darreh Gaz without interruption, and certainly was very strong ly held since Lutf ’ Ali Khan built Lutfabad about the commencement of the 19th century. Previous to 1832 the Atak of Darreh Gaz, w&lt;is, as were most Q-j -^tie outlying provinces of Ivhorasan, more or less independent of Kajar rule ; but in that year ’Abbas Mirza forced it to submit, and since then it has, though very subject to Turkoman raids, formed a portion of Persia. In 1882, however, the Russian Governor of Askhabad proclaimed that all the Sunni villages in the Atak belonged to Russia, and that they were not in future to pay any revenue to the Persian Government; and, as a matter of fact, this has been actually carried out. See Atak. Mountains .— The principal peaks of the enclosing mountains are the Zarrin Kuh, nor’-nor’-west of the chief village (about 6,000 feet) ; the Kuh-i-Kuchan, standing isolated at the west end of the valley, about 4,000 feet ; Kuh-i-Asalmeh, west of the valley, standing far up on the north side of the river; Kuh-i-Aleh Dagh, also the west, on the south side of the river ; and the Kuh-i-Duz a little to the south of west. These last three are not less than 8,000 feet in height. The lower hills and hill-skirts are of soft marls, and shales weathered into easy slopes, the higher masses of limestones and slates. There are no forest trees, and even the character istic juniper is rarely seen; but the pasturage herbage is more luxuriant on the southern face of the chain', and the ravines are well filled with thickets of barberry, dwarf maple, and ether deciduous shrubs. Darreh Gaz n'vcr—This river, also called the Duringar river, is the largest of the streams flowing north from the Atak range. It rises in the junc tion of the Elburz and Daman-i-Kuh between Darreh Gaz and Kuchan, and drains the plateau noith-west of Kuchan, flews west through the glen of Shuraq Durb Adam, and through a narrow defile enclosed by cliffs of great height into the glen of Duringar, past the first Darreh Gaz villages, and thence winding between rugged hills enters the basin of Darreh Gaz, and traversing it in an easterly direction for 13 or 14 miles, bends north to the Atak. Its whole course is about 80 miles, and where unreduced by irrigation it has a depth of 2^ feet and ft width of 20 feet, about 16 miles from the darband or gap by which the Atak is gained ; its waste waters are lost in the desert. If unreduced by numerous irrigation channels, it would no doubt reach the hollows of the Tejen. The principal routes from the Darreh Gaz valley are :— (1) East to Merv across the desert, caravan route. (2) East and south-east to Ab-i-Vard, Chehar Deh, and Sarakhs. A caravan route. ^ * (3) East to Kalat by Igdaliq. Practicable for mules. ’ (4) South to Meshed and Kuchan by the Allahu Akbar pass. Prac ticable for mules. (5) West and south-west by the Davand pass to Kuchan. Practic able for mules and camels.152 DAR—DAR (6) North-west to Askhabad in Akhal Atak. Practicable for mules and camels. Principal villages .—These are Muhammadabad, Chapashli, and Nau- khandan. The first stands 2 miles from the northern range of hills, and about that distance from the stream, and is enclosed in a broad circle of woods, vineyards, and gardens. It numbers 1,000 houses, is clean and well built, and defended by a good wall standing on a rampart of earth, at the base of which is a deep ditch. Both rampart and ditch are as usual deficient in flanking defence, but the place is much stronger than the forts of the country usually are. The walls form a rectangle of about 400 yards by 500 yards. On the north-western side is a high mound, the site of an ancient fire temple, from which a good view of the interior is obtained. This village is the residence of the Khan, and the place of refuge of the inhabitants of the small villages and hamlets for some miles round. Chapashli is distant 8 miles south by road from Muhammadabad, and divided from it by a low, rocky ridge. It was nearly destroyed by the Tekke Turkomans in 1870 ; though many houses are still in ruins, the walls are kept in good repair, and its vineyards and gardens are extensive and productive. It is the residence of one of the chiefs cousins, who, with 100 horsemen, watches the eastern side of the valley. The population numbers about 400 families of Turks and Kurds. Naukhandan is a fine village, the residence of the chief’s son. It lies 8 miles north-west of Muhammadabad on the banks of the stream, and numbers 700 houses. Its vineyards and gardens are said to be more productive than any in the valley. Population .—The population is a mixed one, formed from the various Turk and Kurd tribes of the border. According to the chief many tappeh* ot ancient mounds exist in the district, shewing that it had been thickly populated in ancient times, but Chingiz Khan made a clean sweep of the country, and it has never since recovered. The remaining aboriginal Per sian population was probably swept out of the valley by the first waves of Turkoman conquest, and there are now no traces left of it save per haps some high, circular mounds, which, according to local belief, were the sites of fire temples. The only evidence of former antiquity, that tells any intelligible tale, is a small masonry imamzddeh with a Cufic inscrip tion, dating some 700 to 800 years back. Of the inhabitants of that period there is only this single trace. The oldest tribe, i.e., the tribe that has been settled longest now in the valley, is that of the Chief of Darreh Gaz, whose ancestors migrated from Karshi on the Oxus, and were granted the village of Chapashli. They form, however, but a small portion ; the rest being made up of Afshars, Garilis, and Kurds of all the tribes, living on the other side of the range, who have settled in the valley at various times, taking the places of families slaughtered in their homes, or carried into captivity by the Turkomans. The people of the few villages on the south side of the Allahu Akbar pass are Kaivanlu Kurds from Radkan, from 50 to 100 families. In the east of the valley the villages are inhabited by Turks and Afghans ; to- the west from Naukkandan upwards the population is entirely Kurdish*DAR—DAR 153 ttules W je oi is, is oiger gle of oftlie id tie its for It lea stream, lemro TarioM laffk tlicllf p of tie aalPer’ ive per- if, were ;y, tlat inscrip- i, tie leCliei is, and ■, lot a Korda settled gltered jAkbar In tie ana ; te luidisl* There are in all in the valley, in addition to the three principal villages, about 30 small, fortified hamlets, bringing up the population to about 10,000 souls. Resources .—The Ataks are the granary of Kalat and Darreh Gaz. femce the Persian Government has ceased to exercise control over the region, and all the surplus harvest produced there has been sent to ^skhabad, the price of corn in Darreh Gaz has risen from 2 tumans to 5 per Ichar- wdr, and the population is suffering in consequence. A small quantity of grain is also exported to Radkan and Meshed, but only the continu ance of very high prices can ever repay the transport over the difficult Allahu Akbar pass. The land in the Atak is so fertile, and the water- supply so abundant, that large numbers of the inhabitants of. surrounding Persian districts will probably seek refuge there from* the oppression of their own rulers ; which, as the population decreases, will become more onerous. In the valley itself, too, the land is very fertile and water abundant. With these advantages, and with no scarcity of hands, the construction of a good road connecting it with the interior would at once stimulate agriculture, and vastly improve the condition of the people. There is. room in the valley and glens ascending from it for at least 5,000 families-, in addition to the present population. In the Atak the grain crops return from 20 to 25 fold. Cultivation in the valley and Atak is capable of an almost unlimited increase, on unirrigated lands in both, on irrigable lands in the latter. A very small quantity of silk is raised, and some cotton, tobacco, and opium ; the latter for home consumption. A few years ago its use was unknown ; now it is largely consumed by all classes, but more especially by the Khans and their followers. ... The present annual outturn of grain in the Darreh Gaz district is estimat ed at about 14,000 kharwars, of which about 5,000 Jcharwdrs are export ed to Russian territory (Transcaspia).* The transport available for hire in the district is estimated as follows : camels, 300; mules and ponies, 1,000 ; donkeys, 100. The villagers have no horses and the Khan no stud. _ According to the Chief of Darreh Gaz they got all their horses from the Turkomans in olden days, but since the Russian occupation their inter course with the Turkomans has entirely ceased, and they have much fewer horses now than formerly, when the chief used to keep a number of horse men to check Turkoman raids these, being no longer required, have been dismissed. • i Revenue.—The revenue of the Darreh Gaz district is all realized m cash. Origin of Chiefs family .— Shortly after the birth of Nadir Shah, a petty Khan of Karshi, Muhammad Baba Khan, Beglarbegi, migrated to Persia with a few hundred men of Chapashli Turks of his own race, and was. granted lands at Darreh Gaz by Baba Ahmad Beg, Afshar,. Governor of - i-Yard and of the country round. They rebuilt the village of Chapashl which had been destroyed, an d brought its fertile lands into cultivation ^^Oranoffsky in 1894 estimated the annual outturn of wheat and barley at 28,O0d and 14,790 kharwdrs, respectively. ^ 48 IB /After some years’ quiet occupation a new governor, who was no other than Nadir, was appointed to Ab-i-Vard. Baba Khan became prime favour ite of Nadir’s, and served him devotedly. He followed him through all his campaigns, and was rewarded after his accession to the Persian throne by the governorship of Herat, and subsequently of other provinces of Persia. He was killed at the siege of Bukhara some years later. His nephew, Bihbud Khan, who commanded some of Nadir’s troops in Buk hara, returned as governor of Ab-i-Vard, and was witness of the destruction of all the flourishing towns of the Atak, during the times of anarchy in Khorasan that attended the wars of the Zand and the Kajar. He was himself slain by a Turkoman arrow. Unable, without aid, to withstand the constant attacks of their Turkoman neighbours, the settled population of the Atak retired, after severe loss, to the highlands. Aqa Muham mad Khan, son of Bihbud Khan, who succeeded to the governorship, occu pied the valley of Darreh Gaz, having, as Khorasan was practically indepen dent, no title but that of the strongest. He and his family maintained them selves by the sword alone ; for the support of their suzerains, the Shahs of Persia, was always wanting when most required. Had they been dependent on it, they would most assuredly have been driven back to the barren moun- trins behind them ; while,but for their own sturdy resistance, their seat would have been occupied by one or the other of their neighbours and enemies, the chiefs of Kalat, Radkan, and Kuchan. The chiefs of the latter place, in fact, regarded the petty chiefship on their border as in some sort dependent on ^hem—an assumption that would long ago, if not vigorously resisted, have ended in complete subjection. The following is a pedigree of the family:156 DAR—DAR ’Abbas Quli Khan, son of Beglar Khan, known as the diti or madman, has a curious history. His life passed in chronic rebellion, and he was reduced only by a large force with a number of guns. He was subsequently imprisoned at Tabriz, from which place he escaped and joined the SaVar, who was in rebellion at Meshed. Obtaining a pardon by timely sub mission, he returned to his chiefship, and distinguished himself by the most reckless bravery at the capture of Merv by the Persians. He was Governor of Merv for some time and died there. His son, Bahadur Khan succeeded him, but was shortly driven out. Allah Yar Khan, who sue- ceeded him, was active, intelligent and energetic. He was removed from his chiefship sometime afterwards, but not for any disloyal conduct. His successor, Daulat Murad Khan, showed himself quite unfit for so difficult a post. During his two years’ tenure the Turkomans devastated the whole valley, shutting the people up in the larger villages. The village of Chapashli was taken and sacked, and about 7,000 inhabitants of the valley 'were said to have been carried off. Allah Yar Khan was sent back by the Hisam-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Khorasan, and restored the country to its former prosperity. He was, however, dismissed again in 1882 and his brother Muhammad ’AH Khan was appointed governor of the district in his place. Muham mad ’AH Khan was granted the rank of Mir Panj (Brigadier-General), and the title of Mansur-ul-Mulk was conferred upon him as a personal distinc tion by the late Naslr-ud-Din Shah in 1893. '|i- He held the post of Governor of Darreh Gaz till 1897, when he was super seded by his brother Kara Khan Aqa who secured the appointment by giving a handsome present to the Rukn-ud-Dauleh, the newly appointed Governor-General of Khorasan. The independence of the Governor of Darreh Gaz is now a thing of the past. Though the Government has so far remained in the family and has been regarded as hereditary, the Governor- General of Khorasan can appoint another man, with the sanction of the Persian Government, whenever he likes.— {Napier; Condie-Stephen’, Stewart; Petrusevitch; C.

DASHT (No. 4 )—Elev. 3,200'. A village situated at the south-eastern end of the Gurgan defile, 17 miles from Robat-i-Karabil and 1 mile south of road from Bujnurd to Astarabad. It contains 50 families of Turks. These 50 families provide a guard of 25 savdrs, who are all armed with Werndl rifles. These men are supposed to keep a watch on the road from Shaughan, the valley lying to the west of Incha, and other places, by which the Yamuts cross the Karatigan hills to the north. The hills to the north and north-west of Dasht are wooded on the upper slopes with mdzu trees. Below them aresprinkled small junipers, but these end here and are not to be seen farther west. Water good. Supplies scarce. Close by, in the hills, is a village Daraz, which pays blackmail to the Turkomans. A shrine to Daniel also exists in the range which is known as the Kuh-i-Quzluq.—(C. E.

A water-shed in Kurdish Khorasan, some 3,000 feet high, which divides the Kabh-i-Mura system from that of the Gurgan. It is low-lying and barren, but capable of cultivation. There is no such plain as the Dasht-i-Armutli. The Karabil valley gradually narrows, as it goes west, and at Armutll is barely a mile in width, and half-way to Dasht becomes quite narrow. The road there leaves it and descends through the hills to the south into the Dasht plain.— {Napier ; MacGregor; C. E. Yate.) DASH T-I-GARM A B— A gently sloping pasture tract in Khorasan,' close to Shurab, on the Tehran-Meshed road.— {Bellew ; Goldsrnid.) DASHT-I-KAVIR— Lat. 33° to 36°; Long. 52° to 58°. The great Salt Desert that occupies the centre of Khorasan. It com- i mences east of Kum, and stretches nearly due east to the boundary of Turshiz, fully 400 miles. Its width varies from 80 to 150 miles. It is composed of dark soil, which has the appearance of having been turned up by the plough, but which is covered with a thick salt efflorescence, which glitters painfully to the eyes. It is absolutely destitute of the slightest sign of vegetation or of animal life. The surface of the kavir | is not smooth, but honey-combed, with small holes about 9 inches , deep and the size of a man’s head, so as to form very difficult walking for animals ; but as the soil of the kavir binds well, a good road could doubtless be made over it.160 DAS—DAS The Tcavir has every appearance of having been the bed of a shallow sea. The mountains bear all the characteristics of strata formed in the bed of a shallow sea or lake ; and their red colony caused by the presence of oxide of iron, would support this theory. When the uprising occurred which drained the sea, this desert still remained considerably below the level of the neighbouring Persian high lands, and the rivers continued to drain into it and formed marshes. They dry up during the fierce summer heats, to become marshes again when the winter floods occur. This process is repeated for ages, and in the course of time the whole soil over which the marsh extends becomes •encrusted with salt. When springs are present on a portion of the kavir, the salt is extracted in the following manner. The water is made to pass over a considerable piece of the kavir until it becomes very strongly impregnated with salt; it is then run down into a shallow basin and allowed to evaporate, leaving a cake of salt nearly a foot thick. There are various sorts of kavir, depending upon the soil and the amount of salt. One sort is in ridges looking as if the ground had been ploughed up, then left fallow for some time* and a glazy coating of salt clay after wards poured all over it. When this glazy coating is trodden upon it gives way, and the horse’s hoof sinks into a powdery sort of soil containing much salt. If this sort of kavir is ridden over, a continued crackling sound is. heard, caused by the horse’s feet breaking through the glazy surface. At other times, the whole surface seems rotten, and the horse’s feet sink deeply into it, causing salt to show white on the surface. Sometimes a damp spot is come upon* looking as if it had sweated up from below.— [MacGregor ; Steavart.) DASHT-I-KHAK— A hamlet in Kirman about 20 miles north of Zarand on the road to Ravar. It is the first hamlet reached from the south belonging to the sub-district of Kuhistan.— (Sykes, 1894.) DASHT-I-LUT— Lat. 31° O' to 33° 30'; Long. 55° 0' to 59° 30'. A desert in Khorasan occupying a considerable tract in the south-east of the province. Its area maybe described as a parallelogram ; the angles being marked by the towns Neh, Tabas, Yazd, and Kirman. Its least elevated point will be found on a straight line joining Khabis and Neh. It is without doubt the lowest depression of surface in all Khorasan, for the absolute height of its northern boundary varies between 3,000 and 4,000- feet ; its south-eastern limit at Deh Saif is only 1,200 feet, and its lowest point is probably not more than 400 or 500 feet in absolute height. Its mean slope is in the direction of north-north-east to south-south-west. The term liit is a general term for wastes in this part of the country, but j differs from kavir, inasmuch as the former may have sand interspersed over its surface, but not kavir ; and thelut desert is generally sprinkled, on the borders at any rate, with thorny shrubs which afford grazing for camels. In a track called lut there is no water, but the soil is not altogether saline, and therefore does not preclude the formation of hauzes —a very important i point. The lut soil consists generally of a. greyish, coarse-grained sand,overlying a sandy bed, cemented into a compact mass by a solution of salt. The interior of the desert is entirely devoid of all signs of animal or vegetable life. The temperature of the surface of the soil of the lut in the month of April in the shade at midday was 100° Fakr., and at 18 inches below the surface was 96° Fahr. The relative humidity of the air was, under the same conditions, 11-2 per 100 of complete saturation at the temperature of the air in the shade. This is 0 - 8 per 100 less than the dryness observed by Baron Humboldt in the Barabinskaya steppe, which he considered to be the greatest recorded dryness in the surface of the earth.— (Khanikoff; MacGregor .) DASHT-I-NAMID or TAG-I-NAMADl— A plateau in Eastern Khoras&amp;n, extending north and south between parallel ranges of hills. It extends west as far as the Kuh-i-Ahangaran, and east to Anardarra in Afghanistan and constitutes the boundary be tween Persia and Aighanistan. It is covered with excellent pasture, in which assafoetida, wormwood, orchids, tulips, etc., abound. It derives its name from the narrdd trees with which it is covered. The chain of hills which form the eastern boundary is not the straight, well-defined range shown on the map, but is a tangle of small hills ; there are said to be several watering-places along the eastern foot of these hills. The nomad tribes which graze their flocks and herds on this plain have a regular system of dividing the grazing ground. None of the Persian grazing grounds are more than 4 miles from the foot of the hills. Beh Bizeh, where there is a customs post, is the only village actually situated among the hills. There are two depressions or daqqs in this plain, into which the rivers of the neigh bourhood drain; one being near An&amp;rdarra and the other more to the , south.— (Bellew ; Stowart ; Keyes, 1904; Kennion, 1908.)

An important village m the Dasht-i-Piaz sub-division of the Kain district in Khorasan, on the road between Kain and Kakh, 16 miles from the latter town. It is so called from being a salubrious spot, enjoying immunity from epidemics, etc., and during the last cholera epidemic is said to have maintained its wonted reputation so as to record only 100 casualties out of its population of 1,500. It is situated at the entrance of a wide glen at the north of the Nimbuluk valley, and is surrounded by extensive gardens, amongst which some magnificent plane trees are to be seen. Its chief products are opium, silk, wheat, cotton, barley, and vegetables. The population consists of Saiyids, merchants, men of letters and the natives. The latter form the labouring and artizan class, and wear a sheepskin cap, conical in shape, like those of the Turkomans. It contains some 300 houses and an old fort, and has four qandts (one of which, built by the Kabus, is said never to run dry), the remains of an ancient mosque, with ruins of other large buildings, and a very old hammdm. — (Goldsmid; Bellew ; Rozario.)

A pass near the source of the Gurgan river in Kurdish Khorasan. It has hills on either side wooded to their summits with oak, and the defile which, as a rule, does not exceed 200 yards in width, is full of trees of various sorts. The road is stony in places, and in others, to judge from the holes, it must be very muddy in wet weather. The jungle is so dense that nothing but a pack animal could get through, and a regular road would have to be cut through the wood before it could be made passable for wheels. Laden camels must have difficulty in getting through. The descent is gradual, about 1,100 feet in the first 11 miles. ’ The stream for the first half of the way is very small, but lower down it in creases in size to some 12 feet in width, and nearly a foot in depth. The village of Ishaqi, which is situated in the defile, is about 12 miles from Dasht. It lies away up in the hills to the south and is not visible from the road. It contains some 20 families of Turks. From Ishaqi the road continues on down the defile through thick woods. The trees on the hill side are of fair but not of great size, but the oaks in the defile rise to a height, in places, of 100 and 120 feet, with a circum ference of 14 or 15 feet at the base. In addition to the oaks there are species of beeches and sycamores and a dozen other kinds of trees, and the glades are full of brambles, ferns and bracken. Some 4 miles below Ishaqi, or about 15 miles from the beginning of the defile from Dasht, the defile gradually widens, and the narrow pass may be said to end there. At about the 5th mile the road passes through an old cemetery said to have belonged to Garili Turks, the ancient inhabitants of the country before the Kurds arrived. Some 2 miles beyond the cemetery the first Guklan obd is reached. Beyond this the hills on either side widen out and decrease in height, and one passes through an open, grassy valley with wooded hills on each side, those on the south being rather more wooded than the northern ones. The stream flowing through the Dehaneh-i-Gurgan is not the main Gurgan river, but only an affluent of it called Ab-i-Dehaneh, which joins the Gurgan river at AjI Kaushan near Darreh Gaz, some 8 or 9 miles to the west by north of Chaqur. The main stream of the Gurgan river takes its rise from a spring called Yalall Chashmeh at the foot of the Gull Dagh range. Wild pig and pheasants abound in the defile.—(C. E. Yate.)

Those lying up stream are known as Duringar-i-Turki; the lower hamlets Duringar*i-Kurdi, the former being inhabited by Turks, the latter by Kurds—the latter a section of the Za’af- aranlus of Kuchan. They muster altogether about 200 “ tufangchs ” (musketeers), which would give a population of from 1,000 to 1,200 souls.

DURINGAR (No. 2) (River)— A river in north-eastern Khorasan which rises north of Kuchan. Its principal source is at Shuraq, whence it flows north to Durb Adam and then turns north-east to the village of Duringar. _ From here it changes its course to the south-east and reaches Mahmudabad, where it again turns north-east and flows into the Trans-Caspian depression at the village of Mir K aleh. Its total length is about 64 miles. From Shuraq to the village of Durb Adam it flows down a valley about 300 paces broad, which immediately south of the latter is a rocky ravine, bounded by the Zubaran range on the west and Chuli on the east. From Durb Adam to the village of Duringar it flows down a rocky ravine. From Duringar down to Palkall * the valley never exceeds 300 yards m breadth. From Palkall to Gulriz the Duringar flows down the Darreh Gaz plain and thence down the valley, which contracts at Gulkhandan, and then opens out as it approaches the Trans-Caspian depression. From Duringar to Mir Kaleh the river valley is highly cultivated and thickly studded with villages, surrounded by splendid orchards^ The valley is also capable of an almost unlimited increase of cultivation m the unirrigated lands. A very small quantity of silk is raised and some cotton tobacco, and opium, the latter for home consumption. Prior to about the year 1870 the use of the latter drug was unknown, but since its introduction it has been largely consumed by all classes. Ample sup plies are procurable. A road to Kalateh Chinar and Annau m t e Atak leads off north-west from the villages up a narrow glen . _ Large quantities of potatoes and raisins are exported from the Duringar villages to Askhabad (Trans-Caspia). _ . The breadth of the river at Durb Adam is about 10 yards, with a velocity of 1 foot a second ; at Zainadallu and Naukhandan it is about 8 yards broad with a velocity of 3 feet a second. „ The valley from Artik, on the Central Asian Railway, to Muhammad abad is perfectly suitable for wheeled traffic. The Duringar receives the Incha as a tributary, which comes m from the east. This stream has its source a little north of Mount Maidan and * Pronounced Polu Kolu- Z 2180 DUE- DUS falls into the Duringar above Shuraq ; the valley of this stream is bounded on the north by the Chuli range, and on the south by the Kupeh Dagh watershed and one of its offshoots.

DUZUNG QIRIH— Name of a hill on the Afghan frontier east of Zuiabad — {Mania Bakhsh,)182 ELB—ELB E ELBURZ— A range of mountains in Persia, part of the great mountain system of Asia. All authorities seem to agree that they are connected with the Paropamisus range, the watershed of which runs south of Herat, Ghurian, Khaf and Turshiz, to a point on the road between BIrjumand and Gaud-i- Baghin (Khorasan, which Clerk says is the highest point on the road between Shahrud and Herat) near Bustam ; thence _one range runs back again north-east and east round the north part of Khorasan, dividing it from the Atak, and eventually dying away about Kalat-i-Nadiri •, the other range goes with a direction south-west to the peak of Damavand; it then turns west, and trends to north-west till turned by thg Kizil Uzun river, whence one spur is thrown west parallel to that river ; here the main range turns south-west, and, crossing Khamseh, is joined with the mountains of Ardalan near the sources of the Kizil Uzun river. The Elburz, like every range in South-West Asia, may be said to owe its origin eventually to the Pamirs ; for, as has been shewn above, it is con nected with the mountains of the Paropamisus by a range which runs south of Meshed and north of the Great Salt Desert of Khorasan ; and the moun tains of Ardalan being connected with those of Ararat and the Caucasus, it is clear that the Elburz may be regarded as the connecting link between the two. The Eastern Elburz may be said to commence from the latitude of Astarabad, whence it extends in a serried, unbroken line eastward for about 100 miles to the point where the Naudeh valley cuts deep into the chain. Thence it spreads out forming a broad expanse of hilly country, extending north to the banks of the main stream of the Atrak, and east for about 70 miles. To the west this tract is supported by the Kuh-i-Zirkai, which abuts on the Gurgan plain. A line of heights connected by low ridges divides it from the Jajarm plain on the south. It is traversed from east to west by numerous plateaux, more or less level, forming the Gurgan drainage basin, but draining also south to the desert and north into the Atrak. Beyond the Kuh-i-Zirkai the range loses its covering of forest, and the hill slopes become bare and rugged; but the plateaux are for the most part fertile, well watered, and capable of supporting a considerable population. From the Shaughan and Simalqan plateaux rises the Aleh Dagh, a high mass of mountains which, together with the Kuh-i-Saluq to the south-east, of about the same height and of greater extent, drops its northern spurs into the plain of Bujnurd, and its southern spurs into the Jajarm or Isfaraln plain. r East from Aleh Dagh and Saluq the range extends in a high, unbroken ime, falling abruptly into the plain of Isfarain and with easy undulations into that of Kuchan. Takht-i-Mirza and ShahJehan, the two highest points, reach an absolute elevation of 10,000 or 11,000 feet, while above the plains north and south they rise 5,000 feet and 4,000 feet respectively.East of Shall Jehan the range bends south-east, and is broken by the plateaux of Sultan Maidan, Bam, and Safiabad. Rising from there it forms a high mass known as the Kuh-i-Mihrabad, dividing the districts of Nishapur and Meshed, falls again at Sharifabad where the lower Meshed road crosses it, and continues south-east about 180 miles farther to Bakharz, where it attains again a considerable elevation, and thence on in a broken line nearly to Farhat on the Herat and Farah road. This chain may be said to form the southern branch of the east Elburz. The northern chain is connected with it by an open, elevated tract, divid ing the Meshed or Hari Rud basin from that of Kuchan on the Atrak. A line of peaks stretches from a point 30 to 40 miles north of Bujnurd along the Atak, and thence south-east towards Kalat, supporting to the south an elevated expanse of down, of easy slope and cultivable, reach ing to the valley of Kuchan and Shirvan, and to the north falling with a steep slope to the Atak, and throwing out north-west a line of heights ex tending for about 100 miles into the desert in low ridges and sandhills, but falling just short of junction with the Balkan ridge, and elevated pastures on the shore of the sea. Eastward extend several long, rugged spurs, the most northern one overhanging the Atrak as far as Darreh Gaz, to the south of which it falls into the plain ; a second running north of Darreh Gaz, into the plain between Darreh Gaz and Ab-i-Vard, across which lies the pass of Allahu Akbar ; a third, a low ridge connecting with the Kalat range. In the north-east slopes of this line of peaks rises the Darreh Gaz stream flowing to the Atrak. In the south-west the different tributary streams of the Atrak, enclosed by spurs, extend far into the Atrak-Gurgan plain. East of the Allahu Akbar pass the Kalat range extends south-east for about 180 miles to the Hari Rud, falling north into the Atak, and south into the plain of Meshed. It has a uniform width of about 45 to 50 miles and is exceedingly rugged in outline, the spurs running into the Atak being more precipitous and inaccessible than any other part of the whole range. The principal elevations, the Kuh-i-’Imarat, Kuh-i-Tamas, Kara Dagh, and Takkeh-Khaneh—the last eastwards—have a nearly uniform elevation of about 10,000 feet above the sea level. The drainage of the east Elburz passes almost entirely to the west and north. South, the wide plain of Juvain and Isfarain (which is divided only by a single narrow ridge), with a width of from 30 to 40 miles, and a length from the border of Nishapur to Riabad west of Jajarm of about 130 miles, is drained by a single narrow and shallow channel known as the Kal-i-Shur, which flows under the Pul-i-Abrisham. The surface of the plain is level and the soil fertile; but from lack of water it appears sterile, and is but little cultivated. Tiie first pass in the Elburz, east of Astarabad, is one from the Bustam plain, crossing the chain to Gurgan, a line little likely to be used, and presenting also great natural difficulties. It was traversed about the year 1870 by a Persian force of 40,000 men with thirty guns. Leaving Bustam it passes over the plain north-east, crosses a high shoulder of the Khush Yailaq mountain, into the Naudeh valley at Chanishk, and thence up the valley to Nardin, the Qalpush plateau, and over a high ridge of the Gurgan. The total ascent by this route would be from 7,000 to 8,000 feet; the184 ELB—ELB total descent from 8,000 to 10,000. The Persian guns were dragged by hand all through the pass. The road over the Khush Yailaq mountain would, in ordinary winters, be closed for two or three months. The next pass in succession is that by Nardin and hiaudeh. This, though little used, is shorter and easier, and oilers facilities for the construction of a railway only exceeded by those of the more circuitous route to the east by the Gurgan defile. The main chain is, for some 20 miles, from the Kuh-i-Buhar to Nardin, broken into low, disconnected ridges, between which intervene wide expanses of ravine-cleft pasture lands. Beyond Nardin the ridge rises again and continues in an unbroken line westward. Trap rock predominates in the geological formation, and the rich soil thus afforded supports a more than ordinarily luxuriant vegetation. From Nardin northward to the Atrak, the only pass said to be passable for guns is that over the Qalpush plain, and thence over the high spurs of the Kurkhud mountain into the valley of the Garma Khan, crossing the stream at Chehil Guzar; but any line crossing the whole of the Atrak tributaries must necessarily be a difficult one. Buinurd, Nishapur, and Meshed may be reached by the old highway ot_ Shahabad,’ which runs up the Gurgan stream to Gurgan, through the defile Chunda ’Abbas, Robat-i-Karabil, Robat-i-Tshq,_ and Shaughan ; thence to Bujnurd by the pass of Firuzeh, and to Nishapur through the Darband-i-Hisar and the Juvain plain. . The upper part of the Gurgan valley is narrow, but the road good and gradients very easy, for the ascent in 18 to 20 miles cannot be above 2,000 to 2 500 feet. The defile of Gnrgan had once a good road through it and beyond to the open plateau, which was said to be (in 1874) passable for horsemen in spite of a dense growth of forest. The plateau_x undulate very easily, and have a width of several miles. The Bujnurd pass is difficult, but that of the Darband-i-Hisar exceedingly easy. The route keens throughout so ‘ low that no great inconvenience could ever be experienced from snow in the winter. For a railway to the east no better line could be selected. Yr r- on'/i From Kuchan to the Atak there are two passes—one by Ughaz, said to be very easy, and the other by the Davand pass, a line nearly as good as that by Naudeh, but attaining a greater elevation, and _ consequently more liable to be closed in winter; that portion of it also lying across the high plateau is much exposed. From Kuchan east there are no passes that can be considered practicable for wheeled carriages, or that could be rendered so with any amount of labour at short notice. _ . • With the Nardin or Naudeh and the Gurgan pass held, a force marching eastward from the sea would be compelled to make a march of some days northward from the Atrak through a waterless country to turn the Atak chain, and thence to march 355 miles through a country produemg hw.y enough to support the present nomadic population to Akdarband whence the country south and east for a great distance is uninhabited insufficiently watered, and very rough. The detour would add m materially to the distance to be traversed, and would double the difficulties- of supplies and communication. - -The Elburz mountains are said to abound in mineral wealth, particular ly in coal, lead, and iron. Coal is found in two places within 30 miles of Tehran, while the whole of the Elburz may be regarded as a fine fuel district. A lecture by Colonel Lovett, C.S.I., at the Royal Geographical Society of January 1883, shows clearly what had been done in regard to the survey in the Elburz, and what remains for future surveyors to accomplish.— {Todd) Fraser) Chesney) Cleric) Napier) Lovett.)180 FAX—FAK FAIZABlD (No. 1)— F A large village in the Bashtin sub-division of the Sabzawar district in Khorasan, situated to the south of the road from Mihr to Ribad.

A picturesque village in the province of Astarabad on the road from Jajarm to Astarabad, and about 35 miles west of the latter town. It is described as looking at a distance like a rambling collection of old barns over-grow r n wdth tropical vegetation. A closer inspection, however, show T s that there is much order and regularity in the disposition of the farms, and an almost Chinese precision and neatness in ordering the pre cincts of each little homestead. The centre building is usually of two storeys; the whole, to the top of the tiled or, more commonly, thatched roof, not more than 15 to 18 feet. The walls, framed with timbers, are formed of neatly woven cane-work plastered inside with mud. A wide verandah runs round the four sides, forming a covered and well-protected balcony for wdnter or wet weather use. A thatch-roof room, raised 25 to 30 feet from the ground on posts, is used in summer as a sleeping place by the family. In winter the loft or platform is used as a receptacle for cotton, silk, etc. Flanking the farm-house are usually two or three long barns wdth timber posts, and walls of the kind vulgarly known as “wattle and daub.” Each of these has a paddock, with a neat fence of split cane ; . the straw ricks are well raised from the ground on cross beams, and in a corner of the enclosure stand three or four gigantic barrel shaped baskets plastered inside with mud, in which wheat and rice are stored. Each enclosure has its group of orange trees also railed in, and a few vines. The paddocks are filled wdth fine cattle, and the well-raised and drained path ways and extensive cultivated dealings give an appearance of comfoit and substance: the surplus produce of the village lands finds its way as far as Jajarm and Astarabad: a large and increasing area is sown with cotton. Fidarisk is the chief village of the buluJc of the same name, and contains about 1,000 families, including those of the surrounding hamlets. This buluJc lies south of that of Katul, and includes the wLole belt of forest as far as the Naudeh stream and the lower slopes of Khush Yallaq. It is traversed by several large streams ; the Naudeh, the Ramian, and the ’Audehrush Rud, feeders of the Gurgan river. There are 31 villages and hamlets; tne principal of which are Fidarisk and Ramian with 200 families, and Naudeh, 50 families. There is much heavy forest, but also extensive meadows and cane patches.

GARDANEH-l-ZARDALtJ FURUSH— See Khush Yai 1 aq.—( Schindler.) GARlLl— A tribe of Turks in Astarabad and Khorasan. According to the Sani’-ud Dauleh the Garili Turks were the ancient inhabitants of Mongolia and Tartary and had a kingdom of their own which was at the zenith of its glory before the Mongols under Chingiz Khan cape into power. The king of the Garilis then was Oung Khan who had his capital at Kara Koram. After the death of the father of Chingiz Khan, the latter fled to Kara Koram and appealed to Oung Khan for protection. Oung Khan took him into favour, which excited the jealousy of his sons, who intrigued and succeeded in poisoning their father’s mind against Chingiz Khan. Oung Khan eventually made up his mind to put Chingiz Khan to death, but the latter got news of the king’s intention and effected his escape. He returned to his tribe and managed to collect an army with which he succeeded in overthrowing the Garili Kingdom, killing Oung Khan and laying the foundations for his own rise. _ When Hulaku Khan was sent by Mangu Khan with a large army to govern Persia and extend his conquests to the westward in 1253 A.D., the former selected one of every ten families of all the different tribes of Mon golia and Tartary to accompany him. Among these were 12,000 families of the Garili Turks. The other tribes went with Hulaku Khan as far as Syria, Anatolia and ’Iraq-i-’Arab, but the Garili Turks remained in Khorasan. They settled in the districts of Kuchan, Shirvan and Bujnurd, and remained there till they were driven out by Kurds during the reign of Shah ’Abbas, Safavi, about the year 1600 A. D. A large number of their families were also settled on the Chaman-i-Qalpush, an extensive fertile plain bounded on the north by Gurgan, on the south by Nardin, on the east by the Jaiarm and on the west by Firang, Farsian and Fidarisk. After Nadir Shah’s deatn these were raided by the Turkomans, who killed a large number of them. In consequence of this the survivors fled from the country and were scattered in different directions. The people who remained were those belonging to the ’Ashqi or Shuki section _ who ^ were all forcibly removed to the Astarabad district during the reign of Aqa Muhammad Shah towards the end of the eighteenth century, with the exception of a small number who were also forced by Sardar Zulfikar Khan of Samnan to take flight during the reign of Fath ’AH Shah Kajar at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The majority of the tribe, numbering about 5,000 families, are now settled in the Katul, Fidarisk and Kuhsar districts of Astarabad. The rest are scattered in the198 GAR-GAR Jajarm, Juvain and Sabzawar districts of Khorasan. Qazim Khan of the Ramazanlu section (who were the Khavanin and chiefs of the Garili Turks in Khorasan) gained favour with Nadir Shah, and was Governor of Jajarm during his reign. The Garili Turks have no tribal chief of their own at present.— {Maula Bakhsh.)

A pass in Khorasan, whose summit is 15 miles from Jaghrq, on the road to KIshapur from Meshed ; affording an extensive view of the plain of Meshed on the one side, and that of Nishapur on the other. The ascent from the east is very steep and difficult, and the descent is even more so. The road is narrow and rocky, and utterly impracticable for guns or even camels. It is only passable at all in summer. The heights cannot be crowned, but it is said that the pass can be turned from Darrud. The range runs from north-west to south-east; gradually subsiding towards the latter direction, but in the former rising into the lofty snow- clad mountains of Khavar and Binalud. Yate rode up to the summit of the pass, distant about 3 miles from Robat- i-Pa-i-Gudar, which is 9 miles from Jagharq. The first portion has a gradual ascent, but then comes a very steep pull up the side of the hill, and after an hour’s climb one lands on a ridge near a stone hut, built for the protection of travellers caught in a storm when crossing. Another ^ twenty minutes lands one at the summit. Taking 6,910 feet to be the height of the robdt, as marked on the map, there is a rise of about 1,515 feet to the hut and of 2,325 feet to the summit according to the aneriod, the height of the pass by it being 9,235 feet. The top of the range looks as if it could be ridden over, and in spring is said to be covered with rich grass. Large numbers of nomads come up during May and June, Baluchis from the Nishapur side and Timuris from the Meshed side, and their black tents and flocks are then to be seen in every ravine where water is. About a farsalch to the north-west of the pass stands the Lukk-i-Tarsa, the peak apparently marked on the map as 10,112, and 2 farsakhs beyond that again, a still higher peak named Lukk-i-Shirbad, but the height of206 GUD-GtJD this is not given on the map. The line of telegraph, no longer crosses this range. The line follows the high road from Nishapur vi&amp; Qadamgah and Sharifabad to Meshed. The descent on the far side of the pass is very steep. The pass is closed by snow all the winter from Nov ember till March. During the summer there is constant traffic of pilgrims mounted on donkeys or mules, but all heavy traffic follows the high road.— (Bellew ; Goldsmid ; C. E. Yate ; Winter.)

The summit of the pass is 800 feet above the level of Kain. The ascent from the south is easy in dry weather, but would be impassable for laden beasts in wet weather on account of the clay in the soil. The descent is by an easy gradient to the valley of Nimbuluk, divided here from th^ Kain sub-division.— {Bellew ; Goldsmid ; MacGregor.)

A pass in Khorasan, over a range of hills forming the watershed between the districts of Kain and Tabas. The pass lies on the road from Kam to Kakh, about 5 miles from the latte’: village. The ascent from the south is gradual, but the descent is by a very narrow foot-path on the steep slope of a great clay mound. In wet weather this is impassable for camels, and would require making for guns ; but this could be easily done. There is an easy and short route direct across the Gunabad plain — {Bellew.)

The road up to it ascends gradu* ally for 8 miles, while the descent is very easy, through a picturesque valley with trees and water, and bounded by rugged ridges of a red stone. The pass abounds in strong positions, and the road is completely command ed by a very steep, rugged, and impracticable ridge, which rises along the right the whole way. There is abundance of water, the soil is good, and climate lovely on the range.—-{MacGregor.) GUDAR-I-KAMl— A pass in Khorasan, about 12 miles from Bijistan on the road to Kakh.

A pass in Khorasan, 10 miles from Turbat-i-Haidari, on the road to Meshed, and 1,355 feet above the level of the former town. Both the ascent and descent are easy and gradual. The southern entrance to the pass is about 30 miles wide and gradually contracts. A few hundred yards from the entrance the road ascends a steep, stony incline, and is only sufficiently wide to admit of camels moving in single file, and would be difficult for both wheeled transport and laden animals in bad weather. The summit of the pass is reached at three-quarters of a mile, and the descent is gradual and easy • with a small stream, Chashmeh-i-Gul Khar, on the right.—(C. Wanliss, August 1903.) GUDAR-I-KHUMARI— A pass in Khorasan, 18 miles from iurbat-i-Haidari, on the road to Meshed. It is 1-|- miles in length and is practicable for both wheeled and camel transport. For some distance the road runs along the bed of a stream and the pass is very narrow, not being more than 10 feet in places and very stony.

GUDAR-I-MUHAMMAD MIRZA— Lat. 35° 43' 0'; Long. 59° 22' 0'; Elev. 6,400—(Yapfer). A pass in Khorasan, on the road from Turbat-i-Haidari to Meshed, 34 miles from the former place. The road from Turbat-i-Haidari, after cross ing the Julg h-i-Rukh, enters the pass. The distance from the entrance208 GUD-GUD to the summit is 4 miles ; the ascent in places is steep, and the pass narrows and would be very difficult for guns, more especially in bad weather. At lialf a mile from the summit a track branches off to the right and joins the main track about a mile farther on ; it is more difficult than the main track and only practicable for mules and pedestrians. The descent is less steep than the ascent, and at three-quarters of a mile from the summit the small village of Muhammad Mfrza is passed on the left, where there is a spring of water from which a stream flows down the valley alongside the road. The road winds about through the valley, and at 3 miles from the top of the pass enters a gorge about 40 feet wide and a quarter of a mile long with hills rising up sheer on either side, and then enters the valley of Safid.— (C.

The descent on the north side leads down along winding defile, flanked by bare, rugged hills of chlorite trap and granite ; then, at 4 miles from the entrance, passes through a narrow gorge between high, perpendicular hills of green and red rocks, and emerges on to the valley of Robat-i-Safld.

It forms the water-shed between the Birjand valley and that of Sehdeh The small village of Piran is situated at the southern entrance to the pass which winds very much, the summit being reached at 2| miles. The ascent is not very steep and is passable for wheeled traffic, although the surface is very tTA 18 and i ° f a mile *™t a road anches off to the right to Ghip, which joins the main road a mile beyond that village.

GCDtJSHA— A village in the Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam district in Khorasan, 13 miles from Kalleh Minar pass, 24 miles from Shahn-i-Bala, 9 miles from Havas and 59 miles from Meshed. It occupies a very strong position on the westerly road from Meshed to- Herat. The fort is placed high above the left bank of the stream with steep, scarped sides. It could, no doubt, be made almost impregnable, as it is not commanded, and a short covered way would enable the garrison to procure water from over the cliff. Gudusha is inhabited solely by Barbaris, emigrants from the Hazarajat in former days, who are now settled over this part of the country in con siderable numbers. They are only cultivators^ owning no land themselves. For instance Gudusha belongs to Mirza Muhammad Husain, Herati, formerly Mustaufi andVazir at Meshed, who farms out the land to tho Barbaris at half the produce. Out of this he supplies the seed and pays the Government levenue, and the Barbari supplies the bulloeks and the labour. These terms are rather more favourable than usual, to induce men to settle here. Water good. Supplies scarce.— (MacGregor ; C. E. Yate.)

GdKCHA (Tribe or settlement)— Gukcha is a section of the Kirrikh branch of the Guklan Turkomans, and their obd is situated upon the open plateau near the junction of the Sar-i-Sd stream, coming from the Kara Balkhan valley, with the Gurgan river just below Bindar, and on the high ground between the two. To the north and north-west of Gukcha lies a low range of hills, called Tapashi, extending from the Qamiva range on the east and gradually sinking into the plain on the west, beyond which is Yamut territory. The whole country lying to the north of the Gurgan looks an utter desert, and in fact is known as chul and is apparently waterless. The Sar-i-Su stream coming down from the Qarnlva and Kara Ealkhan valleys is the limit of the water-supply on the north, and, except for a few springs, there is said to be little or no water all the way to the Atrak.

GUKLAN— A Turkoman tribe inhabiting a tract north of Khorasan. Their country formerly extended on the Gurgan from near Astarabad eastwards to the district of Bujnurd, the limits being from Guli Dagh on the west to Gum- bad-i-Kabus on the east, and from the Kai valley to the river Gurgan, 75 miles. But at present the Guklan occupy a comparatively sma 1 l tract of country at the head of the Gurgan river, stretching from Yas Tappeh on the southern bank of the Gurgan river, on the west to the source of the Gurgan at Yalali Chashmeh and to the Dehaneh-i-Gurgan at Yangaran, on the east, or roughly speaking, from about longitude 55° to 56°, while, as a matter of fact, there are only two or three oba all told on the northern bank of the Gurgan, below the junction of its northern affluent, the Sar-i-Su, atGukcha, and those are close to the river. The Qarniva valley which runs into the Kara Balkhan valley from the north, is in fact, the most northern settlement of the Guklan. It is inhabited by the Shaikh Khwaja section, who are all Saiyids and number some 250 families. There is no continuous Guklan territory extending to and beyond the Atrak. The watershed of the Gurgan limits the Guklan territory lo the north and north-west, and none of the latter dare cross into the valley of the Atrak. Up to the year 1804, the Yamuts occupied the country along the Atrak as far east as Chinaran, a district to the south of the Atrak, some distance above Chat, on the stream which is called Chinaran Su. The country between the upper valleys of th,e Gurgan and the river Atrak above Chat is now said to be entirely uninhabited, and there are no Guklans there. The Guklans at Kara Kala and Chandir in Russian territory are thus entirely separated from their tribesmen in Gurgan, just as much as those in Khiva are. The Guklans are of rather a different type to the other Turkomans. Some are rather white and others are of an unhealthy sort of colour, but all seem to have more beard than either Tekke or Sarik. They are fairly well mounted, as a rule, and wear sheepskin hats rather flatter and larger than the usual run. They strike one as rather cadaverous-look ing men at first sight and as not particularly manly. They have taken largely of late to opium-smoking. Even the women now smoke. Like all Turkomans the Guklans have neither trees, gardens, water, nor fields anywhere near their settlements, the kibitka (black tents) being simply stuck down in the middle of the bare, dry plain, the only difference bet ween the Guklans and other Turkomans being that the former seem to have a partiality for putting their kibitka in straight rows, which the other have not. The women have to fetch the water up from the nearest supply, whatever the distance. • The Guklans are cultivators pure and simple, and are not nomadic in their habits. They live in kibitka, but seldom change the site of their oba, and the consequence is that their settlements are filthily dirty. The interior of their kibitka is dirty too, and they have none of the cleanliness 2 D 2212 GUK—GUK t and fine carpets, etc., of Tekkes or Sariks. Not that the people are poor ; on the contrary, they seem to be w 11 off, and the headmen are notoriously wealthy, so much so that Subhan Quli Khan, the head of the Shaghal Tappeh obd, is said to possess three wives for whom he paid a thousand turmns apiece. The ordinary price for the majority of the people is 100 tumdns for a girl, and 400 tumdns for a widow, the latter having an extra price, as she is supposed to be trained and ready to look after the house and cattle, which a young girl is not. The Guklans are not an industrious race like the Tekke and Sarik, and _ they make no carpets, only a few coarse rugs. Felts are about their only manufacture, and if the Hakim cannot get cash he often takes revenue in felts, etc. The Guklans are all armed with Berdans purchased by them at the rate of 20 tumdns per riffe. They say they had some difficulty in getting sufficient ammunition, but that the Russians supply the Yamuts with ammunition and they get it from them. The Guklans themselves say that they are not strong enough to dare to show themselves north of the Qarniva hills, which form the watershed between the Upper Gurgan and the Atrak. They seem to live in constant dread of the Yamfit, and in the fields every man has his gun or rifle beside him, and in fact never moves out without it. At night the villages are regularly guarded by a cordon of watchers. Even in the daytime the mules are not allowed to graze out of sight. The Guklans living on the northern bank of the Gurgan below the junction of the Sar-i-Su, being Khwaja or Saiyid are, by reason of their sanctity as descendants of the prophet, never molested by the Yamut, and can go unarmed to and fro between the tribes as they like. The Guklan seem to be not only at constant strife with the Yamut, but also with^the Garili (Turks) and other Persian subjects in the Fidarisk district of Astarabad, and in fact there seems to be little to choose be tween any of these tribes. Sometimes the Garili of Sangar-i-Haji Lar take the_ opportunity to swoop down and drive off flocks of sheep from the Guklan settlements, in retaliation for cattle of theirs previously driven off by other Guklans, and raids and counter-raids for cattle-lifting are con stantly going on between them. The different parties, however, in these little encounters seem to meet again subsequently without animosity, and no general disturbance of the peace results. Since the occupation of the Akhal district by Russia, several migra tions of Persian Guklans to Russian territory are said to have taken place. Fifty families of the Arkakli section migrated to Chandir (in Russian territory) in 1888, and others at different times. ^ hen the Tekke ruled the country no Guklan dared go there, but now there are said to be some 400 families at Kara Kala and 200 families ? an - C ^ r * ^ ne Sec ^ 0n Guklans, the Garkas, numbering about 200 families, has gone over bodily, and detachments from both the Kai and Arkakli have followed suit. It may, ^ however, be mentioned that sometimes numbers of Guklan mi £ ra te from Russian to Persian territory also. For instance, in some f0 or 80 Tuktakmish, a section of the Kai branch, migrated toPersia, when rne Russians commenced to take forced labour from them, and were settled by the Chief of Bujnurd at Incha-i-Bala and Incha-i- Pain, where they now are. But these are considered to be Bujnurd sub jects, and do not form part of the Gurgan Guklans. Some 100 other families of Dilli and Jan Kurbanli sections of the Kai branch are also said to have lately come from Khiva, and are now settled at Chiklik at the head of the Kara Balkhan valley. The revenue assessment of the Guklans in Persian territory is fixed at 6,031 tumdns per annum, which has to be collected by the chief of Bujnurd wl o has permanent charge of them, and after deducting the pay and allowances of the 200 savdrs who are now kept up at a cost of about 3,000 tumdns per annum, the balance is paid by the Chief to the credit of the Astarabad treasury. The Government assessment being fixed, it is thus to the interest of the Chief and his local deputy to enumerate the Gflklan at the lowest possible figure (900 or 1,000 families), as all the surplus revenue derived goes into their own pockets, and were the Persian Govern ment to get news that the numbers were increased, or the country more quiet, they would promptly put on an extra assessment. The following table prepared by Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, under the supervision of Colonel C. E. Yate, C.M.G., C.I.E., in 1894, gives the names and numbers of the different sections of the Guklans, in Persian ter ritory, as they are now said to stand :— List showing the, tribes and numbers of Gukldn Turkomans in Gurgdn {Persian territory).

A Russian post, founded In 1879, situated some 50 mites east-north-east of Astarabad, some 4 mites tolhe noithof the main route from Astarabad to Bujnurd, and about a mile to ih ’ south of 1 he river Gurgan. Th- gumbad or dome, whh h in shape somewhat resembles a light house, was built in A. D. 997 by Kabus, son of Vashingir, 1 he head of 1 he local d3 r nasty. It is set in a mound rising some 80 feet above 1 he very level plain. The whole of 1h s mound has been occupied bylhe Russians who have fortified it with a ditch. The house of the Russian official almost tone hes the gumbad on the south side. On the north side is a guard house on the mound. On the same side, at the foot of the mound, are barracks for, 50 Cossacks and 100 Turkoman levies. Close by on the south side oi the mound are some 20 shops, owned by Armenians and Persians.' There, too, are the Persian Kdrgvzdri, guarded by 20 sarbazes, and the Telegraph office. The telegraph line runs to Fort Chata-i-Atrak or Chatli 35 miles distant, and thence to Kizil Arvat. To the north, about a mite away near the river, is the Persian Custom House. The Russians maintain a permanent boundary commission here. It - was formerly at Maraveh Tappeh, on the frontier, but about 1900, on the pretext that the water-supply there was bad, they removed it to its present quarters. The country for mites around being treeless, flat and bare, the lower is visible for miles on every side Supplies are abundant. Water (muddy) from the river about 1 mite to the north.

There is a large amount of lararii cultiva tion on the slopes of the hills. The inhabitants are an ’Arab colony brought here from Baghdad by Nadir Shah, and they all §peak Arabic among themselves. There is another ’Arab hamlet called Nizaman, situated about 2 miles higher up the valley than Gumi; the inhabitants of both these villages do not inter-marry with the Persians.— (Dobbs October 1903.) GtJMISH TAPPEH (Turkish), SEREBRANNEI BUGOR (Russian), (Silver Hills)—Lat. 37° 5' 38'; Long. 53° 34' Z2'-—(Puschin). A hill and village of the Ateh Eaf Yamht Turkomans, situated on the Gurgan river, about 2 miles from where it debouches into the Caspian. It lies 38 miles south of the Belei Bugor or White bills, and 8£ miles north of the Ashurada light ship. The Turkoman aul oba is situated on the north of the hill and includes some 500 Tcibitka. It possesses a number of lodka, or fishing and coasting luggers. They are mostly half decked, the largest measuring about 36 feet in length, having two masts, and, when heavily laden, drawing 4 to 5 feet of water. Excluding the Chdrvd obd scattered around over the plain, the settle ment here consists of some 300 to 400 kibitka, stretching for about 300 or 400 yards on either bank of the old bed of the Gurgan. In the midst of these stand some 200 wooden sheds raised on piles off the ground, which are the shops of the principal traders; two or three of these sheds are double-storied and roofed with tiles. The village is miles from the sea, and the goods are all towed up and down the old channel of the river in dug-outs called taimul. The river-bed between the village and the sea is not as big as an ordinary canal, being only some 10 feet broad and a foot or two in depth, and is filled with salt water from the sea. About the year 1886, it is said, the Gurgan river changed its course, and the water now all flows into the sea at Khwaja Nafas, nearly 5 miles from the south, and all drinking-water has to be brought from there either by boats or camels.The prosperity of Gumish Tappeh has considerably decreased in con sequence. The people probably would have deserted it altogether had it not been for their shops and sheds, which they cannot move without great expense. The shops are moslty full of Russian broad-cloth, chintzes, Turkey red and coloured handkerchiefs, samavars, sugar, tea-pots, and earthenware, all of a very inferior quality ; also large numbers of wooden bowls. Near the sea a large thatched shed on piles marks the Russian fish curing establishment. Here some two or three Armenians from Astrakhan are engaged in salting fish and preparing caviare for the Russian mar ket. They have the monopoly of all fish caught, under a sub-contract with the contractor for the whole Persian coast. The mound known as Gumish Tappeh, which gives its name to the place, lies about 1 mile to the north-west of the settlement, and is a mass of broken bricks. Those dug out whole are some 14 inches square and 3| in thickness. The mound is hardly visible at any distance, being small, and only some 20 feet in height at its highest point next the sea. The principal portion of it consists of two regular, low, flat mounds, some 6 or 8 feet in height, which run out on either side to the north and south of what looks as if it had been a small promontory jutting out into the sea, and then, curving round some 300 yards apart, gradually sink down into the plain on the east, so gradually, in fact, that it is difficult to tell where they end. Ghmish, Tappeh is said to have been formerly connected with the Kizil Han (q, v,), or ancient wall. These levels appear to have varied greatly on the south-east coast of the Caspian. On the way to the Tappeh there is a slight beach, which the sea is said to have come up to not so very long ago, and the whole plain beyond is so dead level that it must have been under water at some time or another. At present the sea is a good £ mile from the little promontory at the west of the mound, and yet the report that bricks are to be found under the water farther out still, would seem to show that dry lai d at one time extended even farther west than it does now. The idea here at present is that the sea is gradually drying up. There are no signs of stonework on the mound, except a few slabs which had apparently been used for tombstones. The sea shore is all mud, or rather the ordinary soil of the plain, which becomes very sticky when wet with salt water. There is no trace of any sand. J _ At Gumish Tappeh some 40 lodha are anchored outside. None are in the river, and it is now impossible for them to enter the river. As a matter of fact a small dug-out or canoe can only get in and out with difficulty. There is no sign of the 120 lodlca reported as belonging to the place, though the people claim to have 100. There is a customs house here —(&lt;7. E. Yate • Astarabad Trade Report, 1909.) GUN— A village in Khorasan, 12 miles from Sabzawar, on the road to Nishaphr.

According to the information I received, the grain crop of these villages should be not more than 4,680 kharvdrs, while the population would require more than 8,780 kharwdrs, leaving a deficit of at least 4,100 kharwdrs (189 tons); but this is probably incorrect.

GURG AB or KUH-I-GURG AB— Some hills in Northern Khorasan, on the north side of the Nardin plain or lake basin, about 8 miles west by north of Jajarm.— {MacGregor.) GURG AN (No. 1) (River)—Lat. 37° 4' 0'; Long. 54° 3' 0'—{Napier). Anver of Khorasan which, rising on the plateau of Armutli, and flowing in a westerly direction, after a course of about 200 miles, falls into the Caspian Sea to the north of Astarabad Bay. In its upper parts it is peopled by Guklan Turkomans, and in its lower by the Yamut tribe of the same people. Near its mouth its banks are frequently over-flowed, and they have become complete morasses in this direction. It is supposed that it was in order to stay these floods that the Kizil Ilan {q. v.), or Alexander’s wall, was erected on the north bank. Though there is deep water in the river itself, even boats drawing the minimum of water cannot ascend it, owing to the extreme shallowness of the Caspian Sea at its mouth. The river Gurgan measures about 25 yards from bank to bank. Below Gumish Tappeh its breadth increases to 40 yards ; its bed is deep, and in spring, when the snows of the Elburz melt, there is much water in it; but in summer (except when occasionally swelled by the rains which the mountains attract) it is shallow. Even during the hottest portion of the year, when the water is at the lowest, the river is fordable only at a few points below Ak Kaleh. These points are known as bands or dams by the Turkomans, and the fordable line runs obliquely across the stream. These earth ridges are probably artificial, and constructed to check the flow of the river when flooded, so as to force the stream into the irrigation canals. During the greater portion of the space indicated, viz., from Ak Kaleh to its mouth, the average depth of the river is from 6 to 7 feet when lowest. In some places it is 2 to 3 feet deeper, owing to the existence of holes. The river bank for the most part is an almost vertical earth-cliff going sheer down to the water’s edge. At Ak Kaleh the height of the bank above low water is about 14 or 1G feet. Access is obtained to the fords either by some roughly-torn rain gully, or by a steep ramp, worn parallel to the river by the descent of camels and horses. The river bank gradually diminishes in height towards the mouth. From the river’s mouth to a point 4 miles above it the river is altogether unfordable. The Gurgan winds but little. Nearly opposite Astarabad it suddenly turns to the northward, preserving that direction during 10 or 12 miles of its course, and then again resumes its course westward to the sea. A mile above Gumish Tappeh the height of the river bank does not exceed 5 or 6 feet, and at the village itself is not more than 3 feet at low water. 48 I. B. 2 f226 GUR—GUR This height it preserves down to its mouth. When the river is at its ordinary level it has a current of about ^ mile an hour. During time the speed is between 3 and 4 miles an hour. , , At its embouchure the distance between the northern outlet at Gumish Tappeh and the southern channel at KhwajaNafasis 4 imles.

The fkst flood, however, carried away the dam, and no attempts to turn the river have been made since. The old bed is now some 10 or 15 feet above the present level of the water. After that the river continued to flow in two channels, one to Khwaja Nafas and the other to Gumish Tappeh, till about the year 1886, when the latter_branch ran dry. There are three bridges now across the river, one at Ak Kal'ch, one at Oba-i-’Aneh Khan Ja’afarbai, and one at Oba-i-Haji Muhammad Khan, about 4 miles farther down. The two latter Yates saw. They are both slight, wooden structures built on high piles, and stretch across on a level with the banks. They were erected by a carpenter from Astrakhan at a cost, it is said, of only 250 tumdns each. The piles are said to have been lOf zar's (3£'—1 zar’) in length, of which 41 are sunk in the bed of the river and 6 are above it, and the bridge is said to be 55 zar’s in length, and 4 (14 feet) in breadth. The river here runs between perpendicular banks some 20 feet below the level of the plain. There is nothing to mark the course of the river, and so sudden is the drop that a hundred yards off no one could tell that the river was near. At present the water all flows into the sea at Khwaja Nafas (nearly 5 miles to the south of Gumish Tappeh). There the river deepens through the village, and it is apparently deep enough for unladen lodka or sailing boats to come up. The old bed of the Gurgan river between Gumish Tappeh and the sea is not as big as an ordinary canal, being only some 10 feet broad and a foot or two in depth, and is filled with salt water from the sea.—(G. E. Yate.) GURGAN or JURJAN (No. 2) (City)-Lat. 37° 10' 0'; Long. 55° 14' 0'. The ruins of an old city, the capital of Gurgan, about 60 miles north er, st of the town of Astarabad and on the high left bank of the Gurgan river. There are the ruins of an irregular shaped fort situated on the tongue of land between the Sumbar stream and the Gurgan river, just above the junc tion of the former with the latter at a spot called Kara Kaman. To the south of the Sumbar stream there are long lines of low mounds marking the site of some la ge quadrilateral enclosure, and on the north, in the ruins known as Jurjan ; the ground for a considerable distance is a mass of broken bricks of a small size, and the line of the ditch and of the mounds, marking what were the walls of the fort, stands out quite clearly. The only building standing is an old domed mausoleum now mostly under ground.—(G. E. Yate.) GURGAN or JURJAN (No 3) (Country)— The valley or the country of the river Gurgan, called Jurjan by the ’Arabs, and Gurgan by the Persians. Near the mouth of the Gurgan defile the country is an open, grassy valley with wooded hills on either side, those on the south being rather more wooded than the northern ones. The valley widens gradually till at Chaqur the hills come to an end, and beyond is a vast plain gradually sloping west. The wood and jungle end a F 2228 GUR—GUR with the hills at Nila Kuh. There are no trees in the plain beyond, which is covered with low reeds and grass. The valley of the Gurgan river continues for some 8 miles beyond the Dilma spring in a general north-easterly direction, the road through it going past Shaugha and thence to Fucha and Simalqan, but there is no water all the way to Shaugha. To the north and north-west of Gukcha lies a low range of hills, called Tipashi, extending from the Qarniva range on the east and gradually sinking into the plain on the west, beyond which is Yamut territory. The whole country lying to the north of the Gurgan river looks an utter desert, and in fact is known as chul, and is apparently waterless. The Sar-i-Su stream coming down from the Qarniva and Kara Balkhan valleys is the limit of the water-supply on the north, and except for a few springs there is said to be little or no water all the way to the Atrak. The northern portion of the Gurgan country is not as green and wooded as that at the mouth of the Gurgan defile. The farther north one goes, the more arid the country becomes, and the hills forming the watershed between the Atrak and the Gurgan are brown and bare, and apparently almost entirely destitute of water. The wooded slopes of the hills to the south, however, make the scene a pretty one. The traces of former population are to be seen all over the country. Five miles below Shaghal Tappeh are the ruins of Shahrak and an old cemetery belonging to the Garrlin There is a graveyard and zidrat on the left bank of the Kara Sir, a small stream with a white, low bed, full of reeds, coming down from the Nila Kuh hill, built on the site of some old town, and the ground is full of briclcjs and there are traces of stonework. Near the settlement of the Aidarvish section of the Guklans, or about 10 miles from Gukcha, mounds are scattered about in the plain, and the hill-sides marked by long lines of ancient terraces; while Yas Tappeh, a mound near Yankak, is covered with broken tiles. Qaplan Tappeh (at the edge of the oak forest about 4 miles to the west by north of Sangar-i-Haji Lar) and Yaram Tappeh (about 8 miles from Qaplan Tappeh) seem to be the ruins of large towns. The whole of the land in the valley is rich and fertile and the soil is ex cellent. What is required is population to cultivate it, to make it one of the richest districts in Persia. No irrigation is required except for rice, and the rain supply is ample for all other crops, so much so that the whole country is as green in November as other parts of Persia are in early spring. The summer in Gurgan is said to be excessively hot, when flies abound and became a nuisance. The Gurgan country is a sub-district of Astarabad. The upper portion is at present inhabited by the Guklan Turkomans, and the lower portion by the Yamht Turkomans. For purposes of administration the Yamuts are under the Governor’ oi Astarabad and the Guklans under the Governor of Bujnurd. The latter deputes a Deputy Governor to Gurgan every year to collect the revenue from the Ghklans. The head-quarters of the Deputy Governnor are at Chaqiir, the principal settlement of a powerful section of the tribe. The Deputy Governor, however, resides in Gurgan for four or five months in the year during the winter. During the summer the Guldens are more or less left to themselves, the head of the levy savdrs being the only man in charge.

HARI RUD or AB-I-HERAT— A river on the north-east frontier of Persia, which forms the boundary between that country and Afghanistan from Pul-i-Khatun to the point 48 I. B. 2 a234 HAR—HAR where Kal-i-Kalleh joins it from Hashtadan. Below Pul-i-Khatun this river is called the Tejen (q v.) From opposite Kafir Kaleh to Kaman-i-Behisht the Hari Rud flows be tween low banks through marshy country. The hills bounding the valley on the right are higher than those on the left and stretch down to the river ed&lt;m. The valley on the left bank as far as Fish Rebat is about f mile broad, but below that contracts to about £ mile. For the whole of this distance its banks are covered with tamarisk, and between Kafir Kaleh and the ruins of Kalasang, beyond this belt of tamarisk, stretches a strip of splendid grass much resorted to in summer by Barakzai nomads and their flocks from the neighbourhood of Sabzawar. ^ Slightly to the north of the ruins of Kaman-i-Behisht a low range of hills stretches, immediately to the left bank of the river, and the road, which has hitherto followed the valley, is obliged to ascend the high bank at this point and run at some distance from the river. Lower down at 5 miles the Jam river flows into the Hari Rud from the west, and forms a marsh thickly overgrown with reeds for the last § mile of its course. The junction of these two rivers is called He; an Du Ab. At this point the Hari Rud flows in a bed two to three miles wide, and the normal width of the stream before the winter snows is 20 to 30 yards. About 4 miles above the junction Kala Khaki, situated on the Afghan bank, commands a ford which is used on one of the regular Herat-Meshed roads via Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. From the mouth of the Jam to that of the Istul,the course of the river along the valley, bounded on the east and west by the Paropamisus and Jam mountains, respectively, is very tortuous ; and when the river is full it is impossible for even single horsemen to follow the river bank. There is no vegetation along this portion, except where the valley broad ens out. . . , Below the junction of the Istui the valley of the Hari Rud again broadens out in places to § mile, and is covered with tamarisk and ether bushes. The channel is closer to the right bank, which is somewhat higher than the left. . Farther to the north the Zulfibar hills come down to the river from the east and forming a perpendicular wall stretch as far down as the ruins of Haji Samitdin From here down to Pul-i-Khatun the river winds from one side of the valley to the other; in places offshoots from the Jam mountains approach the river from the west, and from the east those of the Akar Chashm eh mountain and finally the Deh an eh Garmab range. Is ear the ruins of Garn ab the valley opens out and then contracts again near Pul-i-Khatun, where it is encumbered in places by masses of rock.^ At Pul-i-Khatun, it makes a sharp bend to the west to avoid the Dehaneh Garmab range. The normal current is 4 feet, and in flood time, 7 feet, a second, in May 1894 the depth at Pish Rebat was 7 feet and the breadth 75 paces ; at Haji Samitdin the depth was feet and the breadth 75 paces ; at Pul-i-Khatun the depth was 4 feet and the breadth 50 paces. Owing to evaporation and the amount drawn off for irrigation purposes, the volume of water is less in the lower than in the upper reaches of t^ e river, horpurposes of irrigation the water is divided between Russia and Persia in the proportion of five-sixths and one-sixth, respectively. There are folds at Pul-i-Khatun, Haji Samitdin, Zulfikar, Kaleh Khaki and Pish Robat. The ford at Pul-i- Khatun is deep and the bottom encumbered with rocks, whilst that at Pish Robat is deep and only suitable for caval ry. The only bridge across the portion of the Hari Rud under description is at Pul-i-Khatun, where the old stone bridge was restored by the Russians at a cost of £2,000. There is not a continuous road leading along the left bank from Kafir Kaleh to Sarakhs, as offshoots of the Jam Roa(is ' mountains stretch down to the river edge be tween the points of junction of the rivers Jam and Istui with the Hari Rud, and also between Haji Samitdin and Pul-i-Khatun, and obstruct free communication. A road exists for the remainder of the distance, which would require a certain amount of labour between Kafir Kaleh and the Jam river, and from the Istui river to Haji Samitdin to make it fit for wheeled traffic. The valley of the Hari Rud above Pul-i-Khatun could not be utilized for a Russian advance on Herat for the reasons given above. The following tributaries flow into the Hari Rud from the west, viz. :— The Jam, Mala, Istui, Gukhlari, Pain Gukhlari, Karau and Kashaf Rfitd.— {Oranoffsky 1894; Logofctt, 1902.)

HASAN QULl (No. 1)— ' A bay situated on the south-east shore of the Caspian Sea, between the hills called by the Russians the Belei Bugor and Serebrannei Bugor (the White Hills and Silver Hills), being 24£ miles from the former and 14 miles from the latter, 33 miles from the south-east angle of Astarabad bay, and 23| miles from the Ashurada light-ship. The entrance to the bay is formed by two sandspits, of which the northern is called chagil and the southern kaj. Both of them are low and sandy ; the first is quite destitute of any vegetation, whilst the latter is covered with reeds.The width of this channel is miles and the depth 4 feet, except at the bar at the entrance, where it is only 2 feet deep. The bay itself is shallow, the greatest depth not exceeding 4 feet; and this is only met with in the western side near the extreme end of the northern sandspit. The lati tude of this point is 37° 25' 45', and the longitude 53° 29' 45', and the compass deviation 2° 16' 0' E. The bay of Hasan Qull has a very irregular formation ; its greatest length, including the Atrak estuary, is from nor’-nor’-west to sou’-sou’- east, about 21 miles, and its greatest width from west-sou’-west to east- nor’-east about 12 miles. On the northern shore of the bay is the hill called HajI Isa, and 11 miles to the south-east of this there is another similar hill called Sangri Tappeh. Both these hills are remarkable for having wells of sweet water in their vicinity. The river Atrak falls into the south-east corner of the bay by several branches, all quite shallow at the mouth. The water of the river at this point, as well as the water in the whole of the bay, is brackish, except in spring or during the north-east storms, when the water of the bay and the river becomes sweet. The bay of Hasan Quli abounds with fish, and the nomad tribes at the mouth of the Atrak, the Yamilt Turkomans, derive a considerable profit from the fishing trade. Many of them employ them selves also in the manufacture of carpets and the cultivation of millet, musk, and water melons. The northern and north-western shores of the bay are covered with sand, and the southern and south-eastern pro duce a mass of reeds. In the vicinity of the plains and reeds bordering on the Atrak, are found wolves, foxes, wild pigs, jiran (wild goats), jackals etc. The sea shore opposite the bay of Hasan Quli is low and sandy ; so much so that at the distance of some 3 or 4 miles from the end of the northern sandspit only 6 feet of water is found; at 6 or 7 miles from the shore the depth reaches 18 feet. The bottom along the whole seashore of the bay is of blue mud. Vessels bound for Hasan Quli bay prefer coming to an anchorage 9 miles to the north of the entrance to the bay, opposite the Turkoman aid, Chikishlyar, in a depth of 18 feet and a clay bottom, at about 24 miles from the shore. The coast at this point is more accessible, 12 feet of water being found not more than a mile from the shore, and small craft can approach close to it. (Pushchin.)

Good water from a kdrlz. — (C. Wanliss, August 1903.) HASHTADAN— A sub-division of the Bakharz, situated on the eastern frontier of Khorasan, east of Khaf. The Hashtadan valley was a disputed tract and both the Persians and Afghans laid claims to it. The dispute was, however, settled in 1891 by General MacLean by a division of the Avater-supply available for irrigation. Since then the tracts allotted to Persia and Afghanistan have been occupied. The greater part of the district belongs to the Nusrat-ul-Mulk, the Persian Timuri chief, who has built a number of new villages. The inhabitants are partly Hazaras and partly Persians, . the former predominating. Their chief is Muhammad Riza Khan, Shuja’-ul-Mulk, who has 800 Hazara savdrs under his orders. The actual garrison in Taiabad consists of 200 soldiers, 20 gunners, and 50 Hazara sardrs. Inhabitants. There are also two guns. A considerable number of nomads, Afghans, Baluchis, Hazaras and TimurTs, encamp on tbe plain near the Afghan border, where there is most excellent grass, real English turf, among the low hills during spring, and probably lasting well on into the summer. The soil is light and sandy, and early in March the whole plain was literally alive with tortoises, so much so that one’s horse could not canter along without crushing them. Unfortunately there is a scarcity of water. The Hashtadan valley is the favonrite wintering ground of Bahluri and Baluch nomads, who visit the place ev ry year with their flocks, and remain there during the winter and spring when grass is plentiful. Wild asses used to abound in the plain, but they have disappeared since the place was occupied. They are said to have moved further south towards the Namaksar (salt lake). The mound of Hashtadan is the usual tappeh covered with bits of bricks and pottery, marking the ruin of some ancient citadel, and the plain around is covered in the same way far on every side, showing that the city was of large extent; on the northern side of the plain again there are the ruins of Kulukh Fardeh, but these are apparently of modern origin, as a graveyard still exists with a tombstone bearing date 1080 Hijrah (1669 A. D.). Pasture.HAU-HAU 240 ing with the exception of gaz, of which there is abundance.

When this king (799 of the Hijrah) named his son, Shah Rukh, Governor of Khorasan, he sent 1,000 families, or hazdra, of these nomads with him to Herat as a body-guard, being men. attached to the dynasty, and upon whom he could depend. Surrounded by a Persian population, they forgot their own tongue ; but as they generally intermarried amongst themselves, they preserved their Mongol appear ance. Another 1,000 families of the same tribe were transferred to Badakhshan where they are still, and have retained their mother tongue. They are called the Hazara Barlas.

Much more than this, however, is actually realized by the Governor, the villages and the cultivation having been largely increased of late. • Cotton and opium are now largely grown, and the people of Isfarain— men, women and children—are almost all addicted to opium-smoking. Formerly Isfaram was under Bujnfird. then for many years it had a separate Governor of its own, and though about the year 1888 A.D. it was again restored to the chief of Bujnurd, under whom it is at present, it might at any time be taken away from Bujnurd and placed under a separate Governor at the pleasure of the Governor-General of Khorasan. The chief village of the district is at present Mlanatad, where head quarters of the Governor are. Though this village is sometimes called Isfarain, the name Isfaram applies to the district, and there is now no village of Isfarain.

It has a length of about 19 miles, and flows through a defile formed by two spurs of the Galabak mountains, and is encumbered by fragments of rock. The breadth of the valley is inconsiderable, and above Kaleh Istui, for a distance of 3 miles, it is so narrow that communication along it is impossible. At Kaleh Istui it receives two tributaries, one from the north-west and the other from the south ; here the valley broadens out and is cultivated. Farther down the valley again contracts and is difficult to follow, owing to the mass of boulders with which it is strewn. Clumps of bushes and trees of various kinds grow in the valley, as well as on the sides of the hills enclosing it. Kaleh Istui is inhabited by only 4 or 5 families, and the cultivation in the neighbourhood belongs to the inhabitants of the village of Khatai. The road from Zulfikar to Pish Robat follows the valley of the Istui.— (Oranoffsky, 1894.)256 IYA—IZQ ’lYAR— A village in the Jajarm district, Khorasan, 6 or 7 miles from Jajarm, on the road to Nardin.

There are few gardens or trees here, the dryness of the climate and the high winds prevalent m the winter and spring which destroy all vegetation not protected by a covering of snow, leave the villagers dependent on their wheat crops. In the famine years 1870-72 the wheat failed, and the village was almost destroyed, only, 30 families’ remaining. In 1894 the inhabitants possessed 100 cattle, 800 sheep and goats, and 40 horses; the production of wheat and barley was 4,500 and 7,700 Indian maunds, respectively. — (Schindler ; Oranoffsky, 1894.)

The district occupied by these people extends from the mouth of the Gurgan right away to the Balkan and through the Aleh Dagh and Sina Dagh, up to the lands adjacent to Kizil Arvat. The Ja’afarbais have small boats, with which they trade to some extent along the Caspian coast adjacent to them. The Ja’afarbais are large camel, sheep and cattle owners. The sheep and wool all go to Russia and also some cattle. The J. ’afarbai chumur are the sailors, fishermen, and traders of the tribe. These are the best of all. Their kibitka are well and even luxuriantly furnished, the women are well-dressed and covered with silver ornaments, and they and the children are mostly fair-complexioned. The men, as a rule, seem all well-to-do. All look comfortably off, wear cloth clothes, and many of them are even dressed in fur-lined over-coats. The majority of the traders speak Persian, play chess, and show other signs of civilizaCon. They keep their own accounts, and even have a school for their children. Raids and thefts are, by all accounts, unknown among them and peace and security apparently prevail. Like all other Yamfits, however, they acknowledge no authority. There is no headman among them, whose authority is generally obeyed. [Thomson \ C. E. Yate.) JAGHARQ (No. 1) (District)— A sub-division of the Meshed district in Khorasan. It is one of the best sub-divisions of Meshed as regards climate, water, fruit, (tc., and is situated in a glen of the Binalud range through which passes the Darrud route from Nishapur to Meshed, used by travellers and pilgrims during the summer. The glen is not more than three or four hundred yards wide and is very narrow at the bottom, which forms the bed of the stream. It abounds in orchards in which the following trees flourish in luxuriant profusion, viz., the vine, apple, quince, plum, peach, pear, apricot, cherry, filbert, walnut and mulberry, with willows and poplars, whilst higher up are found the elm, ash and plane-tree. The sides of the glen are steep and are irrigated by numerous water- channels taken off from the Jagharq stream, and the whole space from side to side is one mass of foliage of trees of all kinds. In the whole valley there is hardly any cultivation, and nothing but gardens. The people are dependent, to a great extent, on the sale of fruit and wood, but are well off.' / All the land and gardens in the sub-division belong to the villagers in petty holdings, who pay a fixed revenue to Government. There are no landlords, and neither the Government nor the shrine at Meshed holds any property in these hills. The ground is so steep that it is difficult to find a place level enough for tents anywhere except in orchards, very few of which are level enough for a camp, and the soil of those near the villages is very wet from constant irrigathn. Ihe natives are well made and hardy, the women fair, and the children rosy and beautiful, with dark eyes. The people are chiefly ’Ajam and speak Persian.The Jagharq sub-division extends from 12 to 24 miles west of the town of Meshed and contains the following villages :— Nasuhabad. Hisar. Gulistan. Turuqbeh. ’Ambaran. These villages are the sanitaria and the favourite resort of the Meshed . people during the summer months. The population of the sub-division is estimated at about 850 families, or about 3,500 souls. The revenue amounts to tundns 1,510 in cash and 42 kharwars of grain per annum .—{Napier ; Belleiv ; Rozario ; C. E. Yate \ Maula BaJchsh.) • j . JAGHARQ (No. 2) (Pass)— See Darrud (Pass).

A village in Khorasan charmingly situated in the Binalud hills on the upper road between Meshed and Mshapur, and about 20 miles from the former. It contains about 220 inhabited houses, and is built on the slope of a high slate hill right down to the edge of the stream. The houses are so hidden away in the trees that one sees nothing of them, but those fronting the narrow road passing through the village. The village possesses extensive orchards, fuel and timber plantations, and terraced vineyards. The trees felled for timber are chiefly plane and poplar. The plantations for firewood are thick copses cut down to the stumps after the wood has attained a girth of 5 to 6 inches.—-(Refa;; Khanikoff ; C. E. Yate ; Binqler Thomson, 1895,- Sykes 1909.) JAGHATAI or JUVAIN (No. 1) (District)— A small sub-district in Khorasan, between the district of Sabzawar, NIshapur, Bam-Safiabad, Isfaraln and Jajarm. The name Jaghatai, a Mongol word, must have been derived from Jaghatai, the second son of Chingiz Khan, who obtained possession of Khorasan on his father’s death in 1227 A.D., and probably settled some of his tribesmen in it, though the present inhabitants seem to have little knowledge of their own origin and call themselves Turks,2b2 JAG-JAG Its position and productive capabilities give it an importance which it could not otherwise claim. On the south it is separated from Sabzawar by a high ridge known as the Kuh-i-Jaghatai (Juvain) {q.v.). To the north the district is bounded by a low, rocky ridge, running mostly due east and west across the great plain that lies between the main ridge of the Elburz and its rocky outer barriers and it extends with varying width, but in an unbroken level, from Bustam to Nishapur. At this point it has a width of__not less than 40 miles. Beyond this dividing ridge is the valley of Isfarain ; which, in common with Juvain, drains west and south past the town of Jajarm into the Kal Shur, and thence to the kavlr. The width of the valley at this point is about 20 miles. On the west the valley is bounded by the Kal Shur and Jajarm, and on the east by the petty districts of Bam and Safiabad and by Nishapur. Its total length is about 53 miles, giv ing an area of 1,100 square miles, of which about one-sixth—the extreme southern portion—is mountainous. The remaining area consists of a plain sloping gently to its centre and to the west, with a barren bare surface but a fertile alluvial soil, needing only irrigation to render it extremely productive. The hill-skirts to the south and a narrow strip of country following the central line of depression are now alone cultivated ; but there are evidences in the lines of old qandts that in former days a great deal that is now waste was under the plough. The general elevation of the plain is about 4,000 feet which is sufficient to give it a good climate. Being dependent on artificial irrigation, the district suffered severely during the famine, and the villages, save a few in the mountains, lost, it is reckoned, half their population. Formerly, with a comparatively good supply of water, a large propor tion of adult males and a very fertile soil, Juvain used to produce grain enough to supply to some extent the necessities of Jajarm and Sabza war, as well as a considerable proportion of silk and cotton, but an in creased population and improved communications have reduced this surplus to nothing. The people themselves, however, continue in ordinary seasons to raise enough for their own consumption, for this favourable climate and good soil enable them to sow unirrigated lands with advantage. In some seasons in many of the villages the unirrigated sowings were ten times the extent of the irrigated, and there are evidences of a good crop. At present the Juvain district is estimated to produce about 7,500 kharwdrs of grain (f wheat and £ barley), the whole of which is consumed in the country. • The transport available for hire in the district is estimated at 100 camels and a similar number of mules and donkeys. The district is divided into two buluks —Jaghatai and Nikah. The first includes all the villages along the centre depression from Farishian on the border, to the Jajarm border, and the barren plain separating Jaghatai from Nikah which lies 20 miles to the east of it, and those on the skirts of the mountains, numbering in all about 25 inhabited villages. Amongst these is Jaghatai (q.v.). The bvluk of Nikah includes all thevillages in the eastern'portion of the central depression, numbering abou 40 now inhabited. It has very great capabilities, evidenced by the remains of large villages, now ruined, and of numerous qandts. A rough estimate of the population gives 2,500 houses and a popula tion of 12,500. At present the head-quarters of Juvain are at Jaghatai, the principal village of the district. The villagers are Turks, principally of the Qilichi tribe (calling them selves also Jaghatai) and Haji Maghanli (who call themselves a section of the Garilis). Besides these there are about 400 families of Baluch nomads (who migrated to the Juvain district at the time of the famine of 1871, and have remained there ever since) and 600 families of Kaivanlu Kurds (who are settled at Shahr-i-Staneh). The annual Government revenue of the district is fixed at tumdns 16,400 in cash and 10 kharwdrs of grain, but about 20,000 tumdiis are actually realized from the people. Silk used to be largly cultivated in Juvain, but silk-worm disease appeared about the year 1884 and destroyed the worms. The production is now much reduced in consequence. The position of Juvain is an important one, for it lies on the main road from Shahrud on the west to Nishapur and Meshed on the east. When the Turkomans are more settled, the old trade route from Kishapur to the Caspian traversing it from north to south, either in Juvain or Is- farain, would also be the position or base of any force defending the Gurgan pass from attack from the north. To the south-east, a distance of 90 miles over a level plain, on which, save for about 20 miles, there is ample water, lies Nishapur. To the north west, 40 miles across a barren plain, deficient in water, but in which no doubt wells could be dug without difficulty, is Jajarm, a large town dur ing the ’Arab occupation, but now a mere village. Thirty-five miles north, over a level plain, crossed by one low ridge, is Isfarain ; and 10 miles beyond, slightly to the west, is the Darband-i- Hisar {q.v.), the pass leading to the Gurgan. West, over a level plain or series of plateaux, deficient in water, with a few villages, distant 140 miles by road, is Shahrud. West for 25 miles and then south-west 20 miles, along the banks of the Kal Shur is a good road leading to the present highway, whence Sabzawar can be reach ed in two marches. There are three direct roads to Sabzawar over the Jaghatai Kuh, but that by Manidir and Fariumad is alone passable for laden mules. The other two are little better than footpaths, though horsemen pass occasionally. It was formerly held by a family of native chiefs of the Turk race, and of some renown. In the reign of Fath ’All Shah, Allah Yar Khan of Jagha tai held Mazlnan, and a considerable tract of country around it. Allah Yar Khan was the chief of the most powerful section of the Qilichis. He was the independent ruler of Sabzawar and Juvain. He fortified Mazinan and Sabzawar, built a fortified town called Ak Kaleh in the Juvain valley, and joined the Salar’s rebellion in Khorasan with264 JAG—JAJ his son ’Ali Murad and grandson Sulaiman Khan. All three were, how ever, eventually captured and taken to Tehran, and subsequently died. This put an end to the chief ship. The government of the district is now administered by a nominee of the Governor-General of Khorasan ; but it may be deemed by position and connection an appanage of the Sabzawar government or district.— (Napier; C.

JAGHATAI (No. 3) (Village)—Lat. 36° 37' 40'; Long. 57° 3' 20'; (Napier); Elev. 4,600'.— (C. E. Yale.) A large village in the Jaghatai mountains in Khorasan. It is about 600 by 400 yards in size, and surrounded by a high wall, with substantial flank ing towers. Having very little irrigated cornland, the population was nearly destroyed by the famine of 1870-72, and only 100 houses were left inhabited. There is an ample supply of drinkable water ; and since the famine years there have been excellent crops of grain. There is a good camping-ground here. The village is the seat of the local Governor and principal place of the Juvain district. It is situated on the northern slopes of the Jaghatai mountains immediately overlooking the Juvain valley to its north, about 14 miles from Kumisdan, and 7 miles from Dasturan or Dishkijan. It contains about 600 houses of Persians and Qilichi Turks at present. There ar a good bazar and several mosques and public baths. On a hillock to the south of the village stand the ruins of an old mud fort called Karsi, some 50 yards square, and also an imdmzddeh containing a tombstone to the memory of ’All Khan, Qarat, son of the late Muhammad Beg Qarat, dated 1269 (A. D. 1852). Qarat is said to be a section of the Garilis. The name Garili or Gari (‘ li ’ simply meaning “ descendants of ”) is probably only another form of Qarai, or Qaralt, who, according to * Tarikh-i-Rashidi, page 16, Mr. Elias, * were a tribe of Turks, who called note. themselves Mongols when the latter were ruling.

JlJARM— Lat. 36° 57' 24'; Long. 56° 23' 45'; Elev. 3,094'—(Zmw)&gt; 2,950'—(C. E. Yate.) Originally Ja-i-Garm (“hot place”), abbreviated into Jagarm and transformed by the ’Arabs into Jajarm.A village in Khorasan, about halfway between the towns of Bujnftrd and Shahrud, 28 miles from Sankhas, 21 miles from Shafiabad (the border village of Juvain), 51 miles from Jaghatai and 168 miles from Sabzawar, jid Jaghatai (Juvain). North-east of Jajarm is the Kuh-i-Sang Tarashan, to the north is the Kuh-i-Zarrin Kamar, west by south the Kuh-i-Kababeh. The Turkomans in their raids towards the Shahrud-Meshed road used to pass through a valley between the Zarrin Kamar and the Sang Tarashan hills. Formerly Jajarm was a large town. At present it is only a village and contains about 500 houses, all having domed roofs from the impossibility of procuring wood for rafters, and the whole is surrounded by a dilapidat ed wall. The village has two gates, one east, the other west, a caravanserai and seven mosques. The large mosque, the Masjid-i-Jama’, has some fine old tiles. The village has seven quarters (Mahal!eh) : viz., Mahalleh of Sarsang, Sar-i-Bazar, Maksudll, Dehkanha, Hajiha, ’Imarat-i-Kazi, and Sar Mahalleh. From the great extent of the old wall of the place, it is clear that the population of 350 families in the year 1874 was small in comparison to that in the time of Nadir Shah, when there were some 5,000 families. As late as the reign of Fath ’AH Shah (1884), the town furnished 200 men to the regiment known as the Lashkar-i-’Arab-u-’Ajam. Its decline is at tributed entirely to the Turkomans, who destroyed the irrigation works by which only so large a population could have been maintained. The present population of the village of Jajarm is estimated at about 2,000 souls, and that of the whole district including the three villages of Garma, Aivar and Darreh (which contain from 50 to 100 families each) at about 3,000 souls. The inhabitants belong to the following ten tribes:— 1. Maksudli, a branch of the Garili Turks of Qalpush who settled her© 100 years ago. 2. Ganjai. 3. ’Arab from the ’Arabs of Shahrud-Bustam. 4. Uzbeg from Khvarazm. 5. Shakiri from Bukhara. 6. Fakhrani. 7. Husaini, Saiyids, also called Shaikh-ulTslamis. 8. Ramazanlu, a noble branch of the Garili Turks. 9. Hajiha. 10. Dehkanha. In the centre of the village stands the arh or citadel of former days, known by the name of Narin Kaleh, a mound some 70 or 80 feet in height, surmounted with the remains of mud walls and bastions. These, however, do not apparently represent the original fortifications, as below them again, and buried in the slope of the mound, are said to be another and older series of bastions and walls. Part of these latter have recently been exposed on the western side, and consist of two walls, one above the other, 48 I. B. 2266 JAJ—JAJ apparently loop-holed. The mound is circular, or rather oval, about 140 by 100 to 120 yards in diameter at the top, with what has been a large moat all round it at the bottom. There is no trace of any stone or brick work in the mound. One silver coin found in the ruins was inscribed with the name of the mint of Jajarm and dated 739 A.H. (1339 A.D.). The name of the king could not be deciphered, but the coin showed that at that time Jajarm was large enough to have a mint of its owm. To the north of the village lies an old fort, said to have been destroyed by Nadir, who was opposed here by the Garili Turks. Of these now only a few families remain, and they have lost their Turk! and speak Persian. To the south-east of the present village, a mass of broken bricks and other ruins extend for a longer way. Outside the eastern gate, about half a mile from the village, stands a domed brick building some thirty feet square, containing the tomb of Khwaia ’Ali-bin-Muhammad Ziyar ; at least that is the name given to the shrine ; there is no inscription of any kind to testify to the name. To the north of this mausoleum stands another ruined building in stone and mortar, a square room, surrounded by cloisters. There are said to have been water tanks on each side of it. In the' floor of the room is a hole which leads down to a large whitewashed underground room, sup posed to have been a sarddb for living in during the hot weather. This vault is now full of bones and skulls and skeletons in cloth. The village tradition is that an army was seized wdth cholera at Jajarm, and the bodies were deposited in these vaults instead of being separately buried. There are many low mounds all round, and these are said to contain simi lar underground chambers. South-east of the towm and as far as the northern Pul-i-Abrisham over the Kal h-i-Mura, extends a Jcavlr w hich supplies Jajarm and the neighbour hood with salt. The plain of Jajarm is parched and arid in the extreme, and could, under no circumstances, support a large population. The soil is, however, alluvial and fertile, and well repays irrigation when practicable. Jajarm is not well supplied with water, and has few gardens. It pos sesses eight qandts, but these contain very little water. What water there is, is at present mostly used in the growing of cotton for export to Russia through the Armenian traders in Sabzaw : ar. With the w r ater-supply at the present time available some barley and wheat and a little rice are grown, but the crops raised are insufficient for the inhabitants, who import largely from Shahrud and the Simalqan districts ; supplying in exchange salt obtained from the water of the Kal-i-Shur, a briny stream flowing through the plain to the south. The present annual outturn of grain in Jajarm is estimated at 3,200 kharwdrs. The silk industry which Jajarm formerly possessed has now died out. Transport available for hire in the district is estimated as follows Camels .. .. .. 150 Mules and ponies • • • • .. 100 Donkeys.. • • .. 200The direct road from Jajarm to Bustam is via Robat-i-Savanj, Ria* bad and Mazaj (Magas or Maghz). Between Jajarm and Maiamai, a distance of about 60 miles, there are no habitations. Jajarm was for a long time under the Astarabad government. Whe 11 Isma’il Mirza, a son of Fath ’AH Shah, was governor of Shahrud-Bustam, Jajarm formed part of that government. After Muhammad Shah’s visit to Qalpush, Jajarm was entrusted to Muhammad Hasan Khan of Nardin and was made part of Bujnurd. On Nasr-ud-Din Shah’s first visit to Khorasan (1867) Jajarm, Nardin, Shahrud-Bustam, Samnan, and Damghan were formed into one government, and some years ago Jajarm. and Nardin were joined to Bujnurd. At present Jajarm and Buj nurd form one government under the chief of Bujnurd. The scanty revenue of Jajarm was, until* 1880, entirely devoted to th e maintenance of 100 horsemen and two light guns for border defence ; these were, however, quite insufficient for the protection of the border. At present the revenue amounts to 1,550 tumdns in cash, 400 Jcharudrs of grain (f wheat and | barley) and 400 kharwdrs of chopped straw.— {MacGregor; Napier; Schinder; C. E.

It lies to the north and east of Bakharz from which it is divided on the west by the Bizak or Yaktan range. Its eastern boundary goes up to the Hari Rud. Its northern boundary is quite undefined, but maybe roughly put at the crest of the Kuh-i-Qad- i-Shamshlr, which divides its drainage from that of the Meshed river. Its principal villages are Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, Farlman, Qalanadarabad, and Husainabad. The population may number 12,000 souls consisting of Timurls, with some Heratis, and a local tribe known as Jamis of Per sian origin. A body of some 800 inferior horsemen is maintained, and besides the services of perhaps 2,000 matchlockmen would be forthcom ing. The revenue is 13,000 tumdns. — {MacGregor.) See Turbat-i-Shaikh- Jam. JAM (No. 2) (River)— A river in Khor.' san, which has its source a little to the north of Khair- abad, situated on the main Meshed-Herat caravan route. It first flows in a south-easterly direction between the villages of Muhammadabad and Langar, and passing Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam reaches Kaleh Jamrud, where it turns to the north-east and flows into the Hari Rud. 5 miles north of the ruins of Kaman-i-B ‘hisht, at Dehaneh Du Ab. The total length of the Jam valley is about 66 miles. Between Langar and Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam it flows in a deep chan nel, with banks overgrown with bushes ; lower down it flows through salt marshes, in consequence of which the water has a brackish taste. The river takes its rise at an altitude of 4,079 feet and where it falls into the Hari Rud the elevation is 1,840 feet, so that the fall is 2,239 feet in the course of 66 miles, or 33'9 feet per mile. Its greatest width is not more than 15 paces, and its depth 2 to 3 feet. These figures, however, alter considerably in spring during the melting of the snow in the mountains, when the Jam has its source not near Khairabad, but in the Kalleh Minar range. At ordinary times the river is easily fordable except in the latter part of its course, where, owing to the muddy nature of its bottom, it would present some slight difficulty. More difficult than the crossing of the river itself would be the numerous irrigation canals which take off on both banks. These canals are deep, with vertical banks, and stretch from the ruins at Langar to Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. The Jam, running from west to east, crosses all the roads leading from Sarakhs and Zffiabad to Langar, Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Kafir Kaleh. — {Oranoffsky, 1894.)

A peak in the Elburz range, 10 miles south-west of Astaralad. It is the highest point between the ridge of Shah Kuh, 13,000 feet, and the Nisvar peak, also 13,000 feet. The mountain is formed entirely of sand stone and limestone without a trace of volcanic rock. The slopes are clothed with a thick forest of oak. The branches of every tree and bush in the ridge incline to the south, thus showing the direction of the prevail ing wind, which, bearing with it dense clouds of vapour from the sea, keeps the northern face of the mountains bathed in moisture. The J ban Numeh plateau is 6,500 feet high, and is crossed by the road from Astarabad to Chehar Deb by the Sanduq pass. There is a stream of good water running through it, and there are about 45 wooden huts, each capable of affording cover'to from 10 to 20 men. —(Napier ; Lovett.)

JILlAN or GIL IAN— Name of two villages south-east of Shirvan in Northern Khorasan* About 5 miles from Zu-i-Iram, and just above the village Kazmakan, is a narrow gorge leading to Isfaiain through a range which separates the Kafir Kaleh plain (Isfaiain) from the Shirvan plain. The gorge is a little over a mile in length, and in parts only 500 yards wide ; on both sides are almost perpendicular cliffs. A fine stream of water, which comes from Istakhri, a village with 100 Turk families from Merv and about 5 miles south-west of the entrance of the gorge, runs through the gorge and, pass ing Razmakan, flows to Shirvan. At the southern end of the gorge stands the Kaleh-i-Musa Khan, a little square fort completely command ing the entrance, and on both sides of the gorge on the top of the rocks are some watch-towers. A little below Kaleh-i-Musa Khan is the village Jilian-i-Bala (Upper Jilian) with 50 families of the Pehlavanlu Kurds, a branch of the Za’afaranlus, and at the northern end of the gorge is the village Jilian-i-Pain (Lower Jilian) with 100 families of Persians. Lower Jilian has twm mosques, a college and two public baths. From the many ruins near this village it seems that Jilian was formerly a more con siderable place, and in fact the inhabitants relate that Jilian was formerly the seat of the government of the Pain-i-Vilaiat district, and Kuchan that of the Bala Vilaiat district; and that old documents exist in which it is shown that Bujnurd, Maneh, Simalqan and even Isfarain were sub ordinate to Jilian.— {Schindler.) JILIN BILIN— Elev. 7,900'. A pass in Astarabad between ’Aliabad and Haft Chashmeh.

It contains about 600 houses and 100 shops of all sorts in the hdzdr and elsewhere, at present. Outside the town is an ark or citadel, which, though presenting an imposing appearance from a distance, is in a ruinous state as regards its defences. There are numerous fruit gardens, and their produce is immense, owing to the fertility of the soil and the abundance of water. The view from the high central tower of the citadel is a striking and most unusual one for Persia. Around the town, for a radius of nearly a mile, are waving fields of golden coloured wheat. Beyond them in every direction is cultivated ground, on which the young opium lies green. The whole of this expanse is dotted about with walled fruit gardens filled with large fruit trees, while farther still beyond them, numerous belts of trees, with domes and minarets rising above them mark the positions of other villages.

The plain is cultivated for miles round in patches, and yields over 1,000 Icharwars of grain in a good year (700,000 lh), in a bad year about 300 kharwdrs (210,000 lb). It is the property of the Mu’azzaz-ul-Mulk, who some years ago bought it from the Shah. Some eight miles to the north-east are the remains of a band, with brackish stream, known as Band-i-Shah. This band has been broken down for years. The stream is a favourite camping ground for Baluchis, 200 or 300 of whose tents can be seen there in the spring and early summer. These Baluchis weave the .best nomad rugs in Khorasan. There are two other small villages near:—Sadrabad or Band-i-Uzbeg some four miles to the north-west, and Kaleh Nau about four miles to north-east.

KAI—KAI N KAlN (No. 1) (District)— The Kaln district includes the whole of the south-east corner of Kho- rasan, extending from south of Khaf to the border of Sistan, and from the crest of the Tun range to the Afghan border, or a length of about 300 miles by 150, the southern part, however, sloping off from about the 300th mile to Sistan. The country of Kain is entirely mountainous, but be tween its hill ranges it supports a number of wild plateaux and fertile valleys, that mostly trend from north-west to south-east, and rarge in elevation from 4,000 to 7,000 feet above the sea. The principal products of the province of Kain are wheat, saffron^ carpets, a cloth called barak, unmanufactured silk, nuts of all sorts, dried fruits, almonds, and a small quantity of cotton. _ The Kain district consists of ten buluks, or divisions, each of which contains from 20 to 30 villages and a great number of mazraeh, or hamlets. The inhabitants of Kain are of various races and tribes, both of Arab and Persian descent, with an admixture of Afghans and Baluchis. The population is probably not less than 80,000 sonh.—{Goldsmid ; Bellew ; MacGregor.) The Kain district is traversed from north to south by two main ranges, one, commencing from Kakh, passes down the centre Geography. ^ the country separating Nimbuluk, Kain, and Sunnikhaneh from Alghur and N&lt; harjan, and forming the watershed between the low ground of theDasht-i-Lut on the west and the Namaksar and Dasht-i-Nam di on the east. The range is from 6,000 to 8,000 feet above sea-level. The other range, commencing from the Kuh-i-Khaibar, is called the Ahangaran ; its highest peaks are 9,500 feet. Kis ng steep and rugged from the plain of Isfideh on its western side, it slopes more gradually towards Afghanistan, and contains a number of villages on the eastern side, which nestle close up under the brow of the mountain forming the buliik of Zirkuh. There is a good supply of water from springs in the mountains, but, below, the nature of the soil and the lie of the land do not admit of the construction of kdrizes, which would bring the water out on to the plain that forms a prolongation of the Dasht-i-Namadi, The Ahangaran range, therefore, practically forms the eastern limit of Birjand, though its actual limit extends over an Dasht-i-Nama . uninhabited and nearly waterless tract to beyond Yazdan. This tract is, however, not a bare, sandy desert; camels would find grazing anywhere, and within a few miles of the Ahangaran range vegetation is more abundant than on the Persian side, and the scrub is thick and high. These two main ranges are united by a continuous chain of hills, passing from the village of Ahangaran to the north of Durukhsh, and about 20 miles broad, forming the bidiik of Shakhin, and separating the plain of Isfideh from that of Sunnikhaneh. North of Kain, which lies among the hills, and beyond Buzinabad, is a barren and little inhabited tract cut off from Nimbuluk by an arm of the Kakh range. West again of Nimbuluk comes the border of Tabas, and south of that another barren tract of country, bordering on the Dasht-i-Lut and containing a salt basin some miles in length, called the Kavir-i-Muhammadabad. This is the limit to Birjand to the west ofthis latitude, but farther south it extends to Khur, and thence includes all the country on the east side of the Dasht-i-Lut. The valley of Blrjand and Khusf, 6 to 15 miles in breadth, is separated from the bare plain below the Kavir-i-Muhammadabad by a band of 16 to 20 miles of moun tainous country, conspicuous peaks of which are the Kuh-i-Ark and the Kuh-i-Shushau. Immediately south of Blrjand a massive and lofty range of over 8,000 feet,, called fthe Kuh-i-Baqaran, separating the buluk of Neharjan from ’Arabkhaneh, which consists of a barren region of hill ranges and narrow valleys running north-west and south-east. South of this again is the buluk of Nehbandan, a bare, stony country, interspersed with low hills and sloping gradually down towards the clay flat of Sistan. The only rivers in the whole of this district are the Rud i-Shur and the , Rud-i-Khusf. Both of them are more or less salt. The former rises in the hills near Kain. From Kam it flows in a general north-easterly direction, passing between the Kuh-i-Khaibar and the Ahangaran range, and thence to the Kamaksar. Ordinarily its stream is from 10 to 15 feet broad and a few inches deep, but the river-bed varies from 50 to 150 yards in breadth. The river rising in the hills north-west of Birjand, flows through Khusf, and on south-west till it is lost in the Dasht-i-Lut In February, 23 miles below. Khusf, it was 30 feet broad by 1 foot deep. In this part of Persia one often passes a dozen dry river-beds and broad watercourses in a single march, but it is very rarely that one detects any moisture in them, so one * is inclined to think that there must have been a greater rainfall formerly than is now the case. The hills are so bare of trees and any vegetation that,, when it does rain, all the water runs off at once, and the water-courses are dry again in a few hours. According to Dr. Bellew, the district of Kam is divided into nine buluks —Neh, Sunnikhaneh, Zir Kuh, Khusf, Alghur, Neharjan, Kam, Nlmbuluk, and Sahva. With the exception of Sahva, about which nothing could be learned and Khusf, which certainly does not include Durukhsh, they seem to be very correct. They do not, however, appear to include the little explored country to the south-west of Birjand. I had no access to any official sources, and found that the villagers themselves were extremely vague on the subject, so that I cannot exactly state what the buluks are. The following divisions will, however, include the whole district :— Nlmbuluk has 32 villages, containing 6,224 inhabitants.

Add to the above list 57 kaldteh at an average of 15 houses each, and the total number of inhabitants for the whole of the Kain dis trict becomes about 92,200. Though very Villages in the Kain istnct. | ew v iU a g es i n Kain are surrounded by a wall, many of them have some kind of fort as a place of refuge in the villlage, usually in a ruinous condition, now that Turkoman and Baluch raids are a matter of history. Taking them as a whole, the inhabitants of Kain are a fine race, and properly trained under Europeans officers, they would make fairly good soldiers. When their late Amir was besieged in Nasratabad by the SIs- tanis a force marched from Birjand to his relief, As soldiers. variously estimated at from 6,000 to 12,000 men. In view of such contingencies in the future, the Amir is said to have stored some thousands of guns in Birjand with which to arm the peasantry. These would be, no doubt, guns of native manufacture, but they shoot very straight up to 100 yards. Persians live much better than Indians. Their dome-roofed mud houses are superior to those of an Indian village. Very good bread can be obtained anywhere. It is made of whole Mode of life. meal, wheat and barley mixed. Even the poorest people eat meat, and generally very good mutton, which can be bought in any bazar. Wages are more than twice as high as in India. Meteorological Observations. Thermometer.

During the reign of the Khalifeh Haiun-ur-Rashid, at the commencement of the ninth century, the whole tribe of Khuzaima was forced to emigrate from Arabia to Khorasan, and was settled in the Kainat district as a check on the Turkomans, the turbulent tribes of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. The tribe remained wealthy flock-owners, and gradually increased in power till Mir ’Ali Khan, their chief about the end of the seventeenth century, became Amir of Kain. Mir ’Alam Khan, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the last Amir of the whole of Kain, died in the year 1891, while he was on his way back to Birjand from Meshed, where he had gone to pay his respects to the Sahib Divan, the then Governor-General of Khorasan and Sistan. He was chief of Kain as well as of Sistan, was very powerful, and was much respected and trusted by the Persian Government. His country, though situated on the most lawless border of Persia, which was formerly perpetually swept by raids of Turkomans, Afghans, and Baluchis, became, owing to his strong firm rule, as safe as any other part of the interior of Persia. He showed himself jeal ous of the proceedings of the British Commission under Sir F. Goldsmid, which was sent to Sistan in 1870-72 to lay down the boundary between Afghanistan and Persian Sistan, and made himself very obstructive. Though his rule was severe, he was not unpopular with the people except in Sistan, where he was disliked for his extortions of money from the s&amp;rddrs and leading men. He was born in about 1827 and was 64 years of age when he died in 1891. On his death the title of Hashmat-ul- Mulk was given to his eldest son, Mir ’AH Akbar Khan, with the Governor ship of Sistan, and a new title, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was conferred on the second son, Mir Isma’Il Khan, with the Governorship of Kain. By this the family has been split up into two, and the power of the old Amir propor tionately reduced. The Persian Government have now dropped the title of Amir, and simply designate the sons as Hukmrdns (Governors) of Kain and Sistan. In 1908, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk was superseded by his brother, the Hashmat-ul-Mulk, to whom the title of Husam-ud-Dauleh was given, his son becoming the Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The preponderance of the trade of Kain is said to be with Bandar Abbas, but this is not certain. The wool trade is mostly in the hands of Armenian merchants at Sab- zawar who have agents at Birjand, the chief town of the Kain district, and about 5,000 camel-loads of wool and other goods are said to be exported annually to Sabzawar, whence they go on to Russia by Askhabad and the Caspian Sea. The imports from Bandar Abbas are tea, spices, sugar, iron, indigo, copper and piece goods. A large quantity of sugar and piece goods are also imported from Russia by the agents of the Russian firms at Sabzawar.— (C. E. Yate.)KAI—KAI 287 Besides the foregoing amount the annual presents taken by the chief of Kain from his Deputy Governors are estimated to amount to over 10,000 tumdns. As this large sum also eventually comes out of the pockets of the people, the total amount of annual revenue actually realized may be put down in round figures at 45,000 tumdns, or £9,000 .—(Maula Bakhsh.) KAIN (No. 2) (Sub-district)— One of the sub-divisions of the Kain district in Khorasan. It contains the following villages — Khanaq. y Khushgu. Ishfashad. Kalateh-i-Bala. Firuzafcad. Asadabad. Khurbag. ’Askarl. Bazanabad. Pa-i-Gudar. Rum. Razdumbal. Vazar. Nangirift. Naughab. Zavar. Sehdeh. Mehanj. Shur Margh. Farrukhabad. Shahaq. Bilurl. Afriz. Shibl. Sar-i-Ab. Bihad. The population of these 31 villages, at an average of 50 houses each, is estimated at 1,550 families or 6,200 inhabitants. This, added to 10,000, the population of the town of Kain, gives the total population of the buluk at 16,200 souls. There are 400 camels and about 20,000 sheep and goats belonging to the buluk, which is said to produce enough grain for its own consumption, and occasionally a slight surplus which is sent to Birjand. In happier days the buluk could show large yields of silk, but this has decreased considerably of late, having been supeiseded by the cultiva tion of saffron, wheat and opium. The buluk possesses a large number of good donkeys which are avail able for transport. The revenue of the buluk of Kam is tumdns 5,580 per annum.— [H. D. Napier ; Maula Bakhsh.) KAIN (No. 3) (Town)—Lat. 33° 42' O'; Long. 59° 8' O'; Elev. 4,800'— (Walker.) A town in Khorasan, situated 63 miles north of Birjand via Sehdeh and Rum, on the route followed by the Meshed-Sisian telegraph line. It is situated on the eastern side of a broad valby, about 2 miles by 6, stretching north and south at the base of a lofty hill called Abuzar. Kain was formerly the capital of the district of that name, but has been supplanted in this respect by Birjand. Kain was known to the ancients as Artacona, and was visited by Alexan der with his army. The present town, however, is not that visited by Alexander, but was built by the Uzbegs. The inhabitants state that it was founded by Cain the son of Adam. About 2 miles from the pre sent town on a steep hill to the south called Abuzar, are the ruins of a very288 KAI—KAI 4 strong stone fort, the Kaleh-i-Kuh, many of the buildings of which, and even the outer walls, are still in good preservation. The walls are all built of stone and mortar, and enclosed in a space of considerable extent on the summit of a semi-detached hill. The total length of the fort was some 600 or 700 yards, and the interior is full of ruined buildings. Behind these extensive fortifications is a natural reservoir in the rock, containing some 12 feet of water. The road up the difficult ascent is very bad indeed. Another fort, the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, is a mile distant to the east. Men digging for gypsum find coins. There is a modern shrine in good repair at the foot of the hill; this is the mausoleum of the saint Abuzar who gives his name to the hill. This Kain was destroyed by Shah Rukh, who built the present town; and the Uzbegs held Kain until the time of Shah ’Abbas the Great, who expelled them. The modern town has a population of between 10,000 and 15,000 souls, of which one-fourth are Saiyids and one-fourth mullas, who are exempt from all taxation. The town is surrounded by a mud wall about 20 feet high and 1 foot thick, but it has been allowed to fall into disrepair, and the southern portion is broken down in many places. The town has considerably increased in size of late years, and now a great part of it, including all the houses of the wealthier inhabitants, is outside the walls. The masjid is the only building of any size in the town; it is built of burnt bricks, and, according to an inscription on a stone above the arch, was built in the year 770 Hi jrah. There are some 40 or 50 miserable shops in the bazar selling cheap Rus sian goods. The cultivation of silk has revived somewhat of late years, and the annual production amounts to about 10,500 Indian maunds. The cultivation of saffron has now assumed important dimensions, and the surrounding district supplies nearly the whole of Persia with this com modity. It is an exceedingly remunerative crop and fetches about 282 Jcrdns per maund (Kain) (1 maund Kain=3 lb 10 oz.). In normal years there is barely sufficient grain produced to meet local requirements, and generally it has to be imported from the Khaf district. This town possesses 12 kdrlzes and the water-supply is abundant. There is a telegraph and post office in the town.— {MacGregor ; Goldsmid ; 1 ate ; Wanliss, 1903 j Watson, 1906.) KAIVANLU— One of the Kurd tribes, moved from the west of Persia to Khorasan by Shah ’Abbas Safavi about the year 1600 A. D., at the same time as the Za’afaranlu, Shadillu and other Kurds. At that time they are said to have numbered about 12,000 families, but the number has gradually dwindled down. The author of the diary of the Shah’s visit to Khorasan in 1867 gives the numbers then at 5,000. Now, probably -3,000 is nearer the mark. During the general disorganization which occurred in the country after the death of Shah ’Abbas, this tribe was forced to recross the mountains from the Atrak where it was settled. It then occupied lands between Chinaran and Kuchan and held all the mountains as far as Darreh Gaz. Though few in numbers the Kaivanlus are prosperous, but they have no separate importance „KAI-KAJ 289 At present three sections of the tribe hold the Radkan district down to Chashmeh-i-Gilas. The district has fine and ample water. In the summer they go up into the Hazar Masjid hills, at the back. Five other sections live in the hills on the Darreh Gaz border, others are scattered about Khora- san, some 6,000 families being settled at Shahr-i-Staneh in the Juvain district. The chief of Radkan, the head-quarters of the tribe at present, is Muhammad Ibrahim Khan, son of Muhammad Riza Khan, the late chief of the Kaivanlu tribe. Ibrahim Khan is not, however, recognised by the Persian Government as chief of the whole tribe (as his father was), and the different sections of the tribe are now under the governors for the time being of the districts where they are settled or camped. Radkan is an appanage of the Government of Meshed.— (Napier; C. E. Yate\ Mania Bakhsh.) KlJlR— A Turkish word derived from Qachmak, to run away, to de* ert; the name of the royal tribe of Persia. The Kajars inhabit portions of Astara- bad, Mazandaran, Khorasan, and Tehran, and number about 10,000 families. The divisions of the tribe and the names of their chiefs are at present (October 1896) as follows:— Ilkhdni of all the Kajars, ’All Raza Khan Azad-ul-Mulk ; Ndib-i-llkkdni Mirza Muhammad Khan, son of Azad-ul-Mulk.

Besides the twelve chiefs there are about 400 less important Khans, a Controller, a Treasurer and eight (one chief, seven assistants) Yasdval (mace-bearers). A pedigree of the reigning Shah of Persia extracted from Lord Curzon’s “ Persia ” is given on opposite page. 2 0 411 . B.kaj-kaj 291 “ The tribe of Kajar were originally from Syria. They were brought from that country to Persia in the year of the Hijrah 803 by Timur. After the death of that prince and his immediate successor, this tribe increased m much in numbers, and shewed, on repeated occasions, so seditious and in mb ordinate a spirit, that Shah Tahmasp, fearing their power one day might subvert the government, determined to divide them in such a manner as to render them incapable of united action He in consequence separated them into divisions—one of which called Azc anlu he sent to the tov n of Merv inKhoiasan ; one to Ponnah (?) m Azarbaljan ; °ne to Kazvln in ’Iiaq ; one to Ganja iu Georgia (these afterwards attached themselves to Nadir Shah and earned the title of Kajar Afsbar ; they declined from the death of that monarch) ; and another to Astarabad in Mazandaran. In that part of this numerous tribe which was sent to Astarabad there were two chief families. The one was distinguished by the name of Yukarita-h, the other by that of the Ashagabash. The latter became celebrated for the number of wairiors and statesmen whom it produced, who successively reached the highest honours in the court of the Safavian monarehs ; and in the commencement of the weak rei&lt;-n of Shah Tahmasp, the last and most unfortunate prince of that race, Path ’AH Khan Kajar, who was the representative of the Ashagabash fami’v obtained the height of power, and was entrusted by his indolent sovereign with the seal of empire, which he employed more to further his own ambition than to advance the interest of his master., r- ^ “ 4t this period Nadir Quli Karklu, so well known afterwards by the name of Nadir Shah, entered the service of Shah 1725 A. D. Tahmasp, and began early to form those vast projects of ambition which he afterwards matured. Path ’AH Khan, who&gt; was in fact pursuing the same road, was from his character the only noble that Nadir conceived had the spirit and ability to oppose his aggrandize ment. • He therefore detern ined to remove him ; and combining with those ministers who were jealous of Fath’Ali Khan’s fortune, he procured from the prince, in a moment of intoxication, an order for his confinement, which was carried into execution on the 29th September 1725 ; and the unfortunate Path ’All was lodged as a prisoner in the camp of his rival, by whose order he was immediately assassinated. Husain Khan, the son of Path ’All, the moment he heard of his father’s fate, mounted a fPet horse and fl d to Turk^mania, and while Nadir Shah lived he never visited Persia. But taking advantage of the troubles that occurred at that tyrant’s death, he returned, aided by a body of Turkomans, to his native town, Astarabad ; and collecting all his tribe in that quarter, soon formed an army, which made him master of the prov inces of Mazandaran and Gllan. Elated with his success, he marched against ’Adil Shah, the brother of Nadir Shah, by whom he was com- pletelv defeated ; and his eldest son, Aqa Muhammad, fell a prisoner in to the bands of the victor, who on the spot deprived him of his virility.^ “ The dissensions that arose in the family or Nadir Slab soon ended in its destruckon ; and Persia was for a period without a men reh, to: n by the most bloody civil wars, carried on by usurpers, who rose like baneful weeds in every village of that distracted empire. 2 0.2292 KAJ—KAJ “ The chief among those were Husain Khan in Mazandaran, As’ad Khan Afghan in Azarbaijan, ’AH Mardan Bakhtiari at Isfahan, and Karim Khan Zand in ’Iraq. The contest for power raged with violence for nearly five years. Fortune then declared for Karim Khan Zand. As’ad Khan Afghan became his prisoner. Husain Khan Kajar and ’AH Mardan Bakhtiari fell in battle. The more insignificant pretenders to sovereignty were all either taken or fled, and peace was restored to Persia. “ Aqa Muhammad Kajar, who had escaped from his confinement and joined his father, was, on the latter’s death, made prisoner and brought, with his brothers, to Shiiaz, where they were retained as hostages for the good behaviour of their tribe by Karim Khan who, the better to secure the family in hfs interests, married one of their sisters. “ Husain Quli Khan, another son of Muhammad Husain Khan, and the only one that was full brother to Aqa Muhammad (the others being of different mothers), fled into the mountains of Mazandaran, &gt; and raised serious commotions in that quarter. These were, however, soon quelled ; and Husain Quli was taken and put to death. He left two sons—the eldest, Path ’All Khan (afterwards Path ’AH Sbah, and the second, Husain Quli Khan). During the life of Karim Khan, Aqa Muhammad remained at Shiraz, and was treated with icspect and confidence. Karim Khan entertained the highest opinion of his abilities, and took no measure of consequence without consulting him. When that prince expired, on the 13th of the month of Safar, 1193 Hijrah, 1779 A. D., the sister of Aqa Muhammad immediately sent him intelligence of the important event, and he lost not a moment at so critical a juncture. Attended by his brothers, he left Shiiaz under the pretext of hunting, and fled to Mazan daran, where, favoured by the contentions that ensued on Karim Khan’s death, he arrived in safety, and was welcomed with joy by his tribe, who collected from all quarters round his standard. “ The troubles and revolutions in the provinces of Pars and ’Iraq left him undisturbed in Mazandaran, and he made such excellent use of his time, that in two years the whole province of Mazandaran and several neighbouring districts were settled under his authority. “ In the 3rd year, 1783 A.D., of this power, he advanced with all his force against Tehran—which, under its gallant governor, Isma’il Khan, who held it for ’AH Murad Khan, King of Pars, resisted his attacks for ten months. After that period Aqa Muhammad succeeded in bribing some of the principal officers, who assassinated their governor and admitted him at night into tho town. He only enjoyed till the morning the fruits of his treachery. When day appeared, the brother of Isma’il Khan, fired with grievous despair, collected a few adherents and made a violent attack on Aqa Muhammad, whom he repulsed with great loss from the city. On the same day that this misfortune occurred, news arrived of ’AH Murad Khan having marched from Isfahan with a large army to the rehef of Tehran. Aqa Muhammmad instantly retired to Mazandaran, where he was pursued by Shaikh Valz Khan, the son of ’AH Murad; and, unable to resist such an enemy, Aqa Muhammad retreated as his enemy advanced, and at last fled to the fort of Astarabad on the shores of the Caspian, while the whole province of Mazandaran submitted to the conqueror—who.supported by bis father, ’All Murad, at Tehian, remained at the town of Sari, and detached a strong force under Muhammad Tahir to besiege Astarabad. The success of these operations seemed certain, and Aoa Muhammad’s ruin inevitable : he was saved by means as unexpected as extraordinary. Hamza, a native of Mazandaran, who had been taken prisoner by Shaikh Vaiz Khan, contrived to make his escape, and, flying to the mountains, assembled a party of his countrymen, with whom he completely destroy ed the grand causeway, by which Muhammad Tahir Khan Zand, who was besieging Astarabad, received his supplies. The consequence of this action was immediate distress for provisions in the camp of the besiegers, —who, worn down by want and sickness, began to desert in all directions. The troops in Astarabad, aided by the citizens and encouraged by the wretched state of their enemies, made a general sally ; nor did they find it difficult to overcome men already subdued by disease and famine. They made a general slaughter of 6,000. Only one was spared to convey the in telligence to Shaikh Vaiz Khan, who fled with precipitation to Teh ran, where he found his father in the Isst stage of dropsy. This, added to his misfortune at Astarabad, and the intelligence he received, that Ja’afar Khan, whom he had entrusted with a command in Armenia, had rebelled, made him resolve on retreating towards Isfahan, but he expired before he reached that capital. “ The troubles that followed that event in Fars were most favourable for Aqa Muhammad, who not only regained Mazandaran, but also took Tehran, and made it the capital of his government. “ Ja’afar Khan, who had succeed ’Ali Murad at Isfahan, sent no less than four armies against Aqa Muhammad, who successively defeated them, and pursued his last victory so well that he got possession of Ka- shan. Ja’afar Khan was so terrified at this success, that he precipitately abandoned Isfahan, and fled, with a few followers, to Shiraz, leaving behind him almost all his property. Aqa Muhammad took instant advantage of this pusillanimous conduct, and in two days made himself master of Isfahan, which war left totally defenceless. Ja’afar Khan establish ed himself at Shiraz. Aqa Muhammad for the present contented himself with settling the country round Isfahan, in which city he left a governor and returned to his own capital, Teh an. “ This year, 1788 A. D., was not more distinguished b) Aqa Muhammad’s success against his enemies than by his cruelties to his friends, and particu larly to his own family. The moment his power seemed fixed, he began to show his real character, which he had before carefully disguised. He seized and put out the eyes of his brother Mustafa Quli. His brother Mirza died in an attempt to escape. Murtaza Quli Khan, another brother, fled to the Empress Catherine, by whom he was honourably received ; and he was treated with distinction by the Russians till he died. Of the nobles who were put to death, the chief was ’Ali Khan Khamseh ; and Khusrti Khan, Ardalani, despoiled of all his property, died in extreme misery. “In the year 1789 A. D., Aqa Muhammad, who now governed all Mazandaran, ’Iraq, and part of Armenia, advanced against Shiraz ; but when within two days’ march of that city, retreated without effecting any thing of importance.294 KAJ—KAJ ‘ ‘ In the same year, and soon after his retreat, Ja’afar Khan was put to death by the former governor of Shl.az, Saiyida Murad Khan ; and the latter was in a short period deposed by Lutf ’AH Khan, the son of Ja’afar. Aqa Muhammad, hearing of these discensions, hastened again to Shiraz. Lutf ’AH assembled a small force and went to meet him, but was defeated and obliged to find safety within the walls of the town. Aqa Muhammad continued before Shiraz forty days ; but finding all his exertions inefficient, he retreated to Tehran, wdiere he employed himself in plans for subject ing the whole of Armenia. “In the succeeding year, 1790 A. D., fortune obtained for Aqa Muhammad what he had in vain endeavoured to accomplish. Lutf ’AH Khan, the young prince of Persia, though gallant and generous, was sus picious, headstrong, and violent, and had in a few months disgusted all the nobles about 1 im ; and none more than Haji Ibrahim, his Vazir, a man of the most uncommon abilities. When Lutf ’AH marched towards Isfa han to recover that city, he left tlis minister at Shiraz; and the latter took advantage of the trust to ruin his prince, and to transfer the fortunes of the Zand family to that of the Kajars. It was urged by his friends that he knew it was Lutf ’All's intention to put him to death, if he returned ; but this is not easily reconciled to the circumstance of that prince having left him in sole charge of his family and capital. “ On the night of the 18th Zil Hijja* 1204 (1790 A. D.), when the army was within three miles of Isfahan, Muhammad Husain Khan, brother of Haji Ibrahim, in consequence of a preconcerted plan, raised an alarm in camp, and fled with the troops under his command. This example was followed by most others ; and Lutf ’AH, left with a few attendants, and ignorant of the cause of t e alarm or defection of his army, hastened to Shbaz, where he soon became acquainted with the extent of his misfor tune, as he was refused admittance, and even those who had attended his person attempted to kill him. In this extreme he fled to the countrv of Dashtistan on the seashore. “.Haji Ibrahim immediately sent a messenger to Aqa Muhammad to inform him that he wmuld deliver up the fort of Shiraz to whomever he chose to, send, as it was his desire to put an end to war that had so long desolated the country. Aqa Muhammad received the news in Armenia, and despatched 8,COO men to Shiiaz in three divisions at three different periods, under his chief officers, Mustafa Quli Khan, Bala Kajar, Jan Muhammad Khan, and Raza Quli Khan. Lutf AH heard of their approach ; and though he could only assemble between four and five hundred men, he scorned to give up the struggle ; and, advancing towards ShLaz, he attacked the Kajar generals separately and combined, and always with success. In the last great action he had with them he took prisoner Raza Quli Khan, with 1,200 men, to whom he behav d with great cruelty. Aqa Muhammad, on receiving these accounts, advanced with his whole army, which amounted to about 60,000 men. When encamped within three days of Shiraz, Lutf ’AH, concealing his want of numbers under the shade of night, attacked, with a body not exceeding 500, this * The last month of the Arabian year.immense force. He completely surprised the camp—all was terror and confusion. He had advanced close to the tent of Aqa Muhammad, and had he proceeded, he would have been sovereign of Persia by one of the most bold and wonderful actions that ever was recorded in history. But he unfortunately listened to a pretended friend, who assured him that Aqa Muhammad and every soldier of his army had fled, and that only the baggage and treasure remained; and that if he attempted to seize that before morning, he would lose in a promiscuous plunder what, if preserved, would make him a rich monarch. Thus deceived he waited till day; and when that broke, an extraordinary spectacle was presented. Aqa Muhammad, surrounded by about 10,000 of his army, mostlv the infantry, which were all that remained, and the victorious Lutf ’AH Khan, a few hundred yards from his tent, with about fifty horsemen, the rest having separated to plunder. Lutf ’AH Khan, of course fled. Aqa Muhammad advanced and took possession of ShLaz where he remained till the whole of his army reassembled. Some of the fugitives did not stop till they reached Tehran, which is upwards of 20 days’ journey. 4 ‘ Aqa Muhammad now assumed the sovereignty of all Persia. He seized every relation of the Zand family, and those whom he did not put to death he deprived of their sight. He distributed the women of Lutf ’AH Khan among his mule-drivers, the greatest disgrace he could possibly inflict. On HajI Ibrahim he bestowed the highest honour, and twelve months afterwards, when he determined to follow Lutf ’AH Khan (who, assisted bj about 200 followers, had taken Kinhan), he appointed him governor of all Pars. “ Tllls expedition of Aqa Muhammad was attended with the most shocking ravages; he laid waste the country and murdered the inhabitants as he went along. He was nine months besieging the town of Kirman before he could take it; and Lutf AH Khan having, previous to its surrender, cut his way through the strongest part of his army with only seven attendants, he is said to have given way to the most savage fury and to have wreaked all his vengeance on the “inhabitants. The men who were not slain had their eyes plucked out, and it is affirmed on undoubted authority that seven hundred suffered this dreadful punishment in one day. The women and children were delivered up to the lust and fury of the savage Turkomans. Lutf ’AH Khan fled to Bam, which is about two hundred and forty miles from Kirman. Its faithless inhabitants first invited him to their fort; then seized him and sent him to Aqa Muhammad, who immediately deprived him of sight, and then sent him to Tehran, where he rvas put to death. Ihus perished, in the 28th year of his age, a prince, who was perhaps never surpassed in personal strength and undaunted courage. He is also said to have been generous and charitable ; but his temper was proud and unequal, and his passion so irregular and violent, that he was no less the terror of his friends than of his enemies. Aqa Muhammad after this success marched from Kirman to Shiraz the fortifications of which city he razed to the ground. He appointed Haji Ibrahim Vazir to the empire, and after a halt of two months went to Tehran.296 KAJ-KAJ “ In the year 1794 A.D., Aqa Muhammad proclaimed his nephew, Fath ’All Khan, commonly called Baba Khan, 1794 A. D. successor to the throne, and, appointing him to the government of Persia proper, sent him to reside at Shiraz. He also put to death his brother. Ja’afar Quli Khan, from motives of jealousy. “ In 1795 A.D. he marched into the province of Armenia, all of which he subdued except the fort of Shisheh—which 1795 A. D. under its governor, Ibrahim Kulbal (?) Khan, gallantly resisted his attack for eight months. Despairing of success, he rais ed the siege and marched into Georgia. He was encountered near Tiflis, • The prince Herakly or tte capital of the prince, by the Vaii Arkuli Heraclius, so well known in Khan, whom he defeated, and the city in con- Europe. He was upwards of sequence fell into his possession. He only re- 100 years of age at this period, niained there .twelve days, which he employed in destroying and burning the town and in acts of most inhuman cruelty. All of the inhabitants that were spared from the sword were given to his army as slaves. After these excesses he returned to Teh]an, and commenced prepara tions for an expedition against Khorasan, which extensive province was ruled by a number of petty princes and chiefs, who had neither owned the authority of the prince of Kandahar nor of Persia since the death of Nadir Shah. “ The chief of these were Shah Rukh, grandson to Nadir, who ruled at Meshed ; Mir Husain Khan, of Tabas ; Allah Yar Khan, of Sabzawar; Mustafa Khan, of Turshiz ; Ja’far Khan, of NishapSr ; Mihr ’Ali Khan, of Birjand, and Amir Guna Khan, of Kuchan. These rulers, who had never united in one cause, were not only distracted at this period by their inter nal quarrels, but alarmed by an invasion of Uzbegs. They in consequence received Aqa Muhammad more as a friend than an enemy, and he ad vanced to Meshed without opposition. He made himself master of that city ; and Shah Rukh, who was blinded in a former revolution, fell into his hands, with his family, except his eldest son Nasir Mirza, who made his escape to Herat. “ Whether Aqa Mahummad’s conduct to this family was prompted by avarice, or revenge of the early wrongs he had received from one of its branches, or both, it is immaterial to imagine. The cruelties he commit ted on them were shocking to nature. Round the head of Shah Rukh he made a ring of paste, and poured boiling oil .upon his crown. The excruciating torture forced that prince to confess where the remains of the jewels and treasure brought from India by Nadir Shah were concealed, but the discovery did not save his life, of which he was deprived by the cruel means mentioned. All the males of this unfortunate family were made eunuchs and the females, old and young, were distributed among the ! mule-drivers of the army. After these and a thousand other actions of a similiar nature, Aqa Muhammad returned to Tehran, leaving garrisons in Meshed and other forts in Khorasan. “ In the year 1797 A. D., he learned that the Empress of Russia, resent- ing his attack on the Georgians, had sent an ' ' army amounting to 30,000 men, and that they had advanced as far as the city of Ardabil. He immediately began pre parations to oppose them, but before these were made, the death of the JEmpress Catherine occasioned a change of measures in the Russian Court, and the troops were recalled. The king turned the great force he had collected against the fort of Shisheh, which the governor, Ibrahim Kulbal, alarmed at his numbers, evacuated and fled. The moment Aqa Muhammad received this intelligence, he crossed the Aras with a small party, leaving the bulk of his army under Haji Ibrahim on the Persian side of that river. He easily got possession of Shisheh and began to exercise not only the most wanton cruelties on the inhabitants, but on his own adherents ; and to take such delight in shedding blood, that it is affirmed he seldom said his prayers without giving signals in the midst of them to those around him to strike off the heads of some with whom he was offended. “ But his fate was near. On the night of the 18th of Zil Hijja, as he was going to rest, he called three of his personal servants, and upbraiding’ them for having lost or stolen one or two piastres, he told them to go and take leave of their families and to say their prayers, as he would certainly put them to death next morning. Retiring disconsolate from his pre sence, they met Sbadi Khan Shakaki, who had been playing at chess with the king and had lost a large sum, which had ruffled his temper ; and on his asking them the cause of their grief, they briefly stated what had occurred, and added the certainty of the king doing as he had threatened. ‘'If you are assured of that,’ said Shadi Khan,‘ where is the risk in a brave attempt to save your lives’? Encouraged by this speech from a man of the first rank in the state, they consulted together, and in two hours returned to the chamber of Aqa Muhammad, and perceiving that he was asleep, they desired, as from him, the guards to retire, lest they should disturb his repose. As they were known to be personal servanfs, the command was instantly obeyed. The guards had no' sooner removed than they went into the room and, falling upon the sleeping, king, despatched him with a hundred wounds, ‘ ‘ It was sunrise next day before this event was known. The moment;: it became public, the army in Shisheh dispersed. Some joined Haji Ibrahim ; others went to Husain Quli Khan ; and many retired altogether from a* scene where they anticipated nothing but confusion. “ The body of Aqa Muhammad, left unprotected, fell into the hands of the Armenians, who for two days, in revenge for their wrongs, treated it with every indignity, dragging it by the heels through the streets ; and to complete their insult, they buried it in the common sewer of the town. Aqa Muhammad was a man of great abilities, but destitute of every virtue. Avarice and cruelty were the predominant passions of his mind the former he carried to an extreme, of which history furnishes no example;: The great wisdom of Haji Ibiahim, the minister, and the fidelity of 1798 A. D. Mirza Muhammad Khan Kajar, Governor of Tehran, added to the cruel precautions which Aqa Muhammad had taken, secured a quiet succession to Baba Khan. That prince, who was at Shiraz, received the accounts of his uncle’s fate on the 7th of Muharram, 1212 Hijrah, and instantly set out for the capital, where he arrived in a few days and was acknowledged as sovereign. “ The only person who made any opposition to his succession was Shadi Khan Shakaki. That noble, who has been already mentioned, and whose298 KAJ—KAJ power was very great, marched with his tribe, who were numerous, towards Tehran, and assumed the insignia and titles of royalty. Baba Khan advanced towards Kazvin to meet him ; and an action was fought, in which Shad! Khan *vas defeated. After this action that nobleman, ashamed of his conduct, threw himself on the king’s clemency, who not only pardoned him, but took him into favour. “ Isma’il Khalil Khan, of Shisheh, observing this clement disposition in the young monarch, sent the corpse of Aqa Muhammad in great pomp, and supplicated pardon for his past conduct. Baba Khan accepted his submission, and had the body of his uncle conveyed in great state to be interred at the holy Najaf. ‘ ‘ The Yali of Georgia also addressed a letter of allegiance and submis sion, which was graciously received. The king gave strict orders for the apprehension of his uncle’s murderers, all of whom were taken and put to death. “ Haji Ibrahim continued in the office of Vazir ; and all the’ZJwara in the stations they had before held. This conduct diffused confidence through all ranks, and the country began to assume the most promising aspects. This peace was disturbed by the rebellion of Husain Quli Khan, the king’s brother. That prince, who was governor of Fars, instigated by restless and ambitious men, assumed the rank of sovereign and made preparations to oppose his brother. “ One of his first actions was to take Bushire, which he easily effect ed ; the Shaikh and all the chief inhabitants making their escape in boats. He next advanced to meet the king, who was approaching from Tehran. When the armies were drawn out opposite to each other, and an engagement was expected to begin every moment, Husain ’ Quli Khan, to the utter astonishment of his troops, rode off towards his brother’s line, attended by a single horseman. The moment he came near, he alighted and kissed his stirrup. Baba Khan dismounted and embraced him ; and a complete reconciliation took place. It is said this was chiefly effected by their mother, who was almost distracted at the difference that had arisen between them. The king took Husain Quli Khan to court, and bestowed the government of Fars on Muhammad ’AH Khan Kajar. “ In 1799 A. D. the king marched to Khorasan ; but on account of the 1799 A. D. protracted siege of ^Nishapur, the disaffection of of the principal chiefs, and a scarcity of provisions, he was obliged to return without effecting anything of con sequence. After his return from the Khorasan expedition he removed Muhammad ’All from the government of Fars on account of his oppress ing the poor, and appointed the prince Husain ’All Mirza to that high station. He then sent another of his sons into Armenia, and one to Isfahan.” The above is extracted from Sir John Malcolm’s “ Memoirs of the Kajirs.” From the date of the succession of Fath ’All Shah till now the crown of Persia has remained in the hands of the Kajars.KAJDARAKHT— A village of 20 houses, 10 miles from Turbat-i-Haidail, on the road to Turshiz.

A village in Khorasan, 90 miles from Turbat-i-Haidan, 13 miles from J&amp;min (or Jumand) and 15 miles from Khizri on the road to Birjancl. It is situated on rising ground, up a barren, stony slope at the mouth of a ravine, at the base of the lofty Siah Kuh hills bounding the valley of G\ii abaci to the south and west. The population, in 1872, consisted of some 500 families; but it had suffered greatly from the famine of the pre ceding year. At present the village, which is a good sized one, contains about 1,500 houses, and possesses 100 cattle and 2,000 sheep. The land under cultivation is mostly terraced out on the slope below the village. Its water-supply from four qanats and fifty natural springs is excellent. Muttas and Saiyids, of course, abound in the village, where there is also a madraseh, or college, two masjids, two caravanserais and 30 miscel laneous shops. Two ancient mud citadels, constructed one within the other, form another remarkable feature in the village. They were built on an elevation above the village, with high walls and flanking towers, were connected by a draw-bridge, and each had an independent supply . of water, but they are in ruins now. The principal manufactures in the town are iron agricultural implements and small, inlaid pocket saws, for which there are as many as 40 iron-wwkers’ shops, and a kind of silk embroidery, called kaslnda.

Opium for the market at Yazd is extensively cultivated in the neighbouring valley, as well as cotton. The inhabitants are Persians ; and there are a few houses of a tribe called Zanyin.

KALAT CHAl (River)— A river in north-eastern Khorasan, which rises a little to the south-wes* . of Kalat in the slopes of the Kuh-i-Tmarat. It at first flows along the foot of the southern wall of this range in a north-westerly direction, and then turns almost due'east and pierces it by a remarkable natural gap known as the Darband, or defile, of Arghavan Shah. The narrowest part of this gap, which has a width of about 40 paces, is closed by gates so constructed as to give free passage to the stream when swollen by floods. The whole length of the passage or gap is about 400 yards, which gives the width of base of the enclosing wall at that point The crest, 500 feet above the stream, is so narrow, that a single man with difficulty finds foothold on it. Clearing this remarkable defile the stream widens out over a pebbly bed, and, passing under a small fort defended by two guns, and round the little village of Arghavan Shah of 30 houses, enters a green and fertile valley, into which the plateaux on either side descend easily, leaving between their slopes a strip of level ground, through which the stream meanders gently, shaded by thickets of fruit and forest trees. The moist ground lying between the loops and bends of the stream bears fine crops of rice, and the hill slopel are terraced and covered with orchards and vineyards, small in extent, but very productive. Passing the village of Guk Gumbad, the valley widens slightly till it reaches the centre of the plateau, where the stream enters a deep, rocky gorge, and flows nearly north between precipitous banks to the northern wall of enclosing heights, through which it passes by a gap similar to that of Arghavan Shah, known as the Darband-i-Nafta. Thence it winds through a maze of low hills to the Trans-Caspian depression, where its waters irrigate the rice-fields of Chehar Deh, crossing the Russo-Persian frontier at HajI Chashmeh. The stream, where it flows through the Kalat, is clear and bright; but its water is said by the natives to be impregnated from its source with naphtha. From this or some other cause,—possibly from the malaria that it generates in its passage through a low, narrow, pent-up valley with a good deal of irrigated land,—it certainly has a most marked dele'terious effect on the health of all, save the natives, living within its influence. The total length of the river is 30 miles. East of the village of Istiksu it r?ceives as a tributary on the right bank the small stream of Mirza Giasht, &gt;viiich flows through a narrow defile : on the left bank near the same villageit receives the stream of Istiksii. At the defile of Arghavan’Shah it is joined by the small stream of Yangi Kaleh, which in its turn receives the Kara Su. AH these tributaries are insignificant streams.

KALAT-I-NADIRI— A district of Khorasan, situated on the north-east frontier of Persia, and bounded on the north by Trans-Caspia, on the west by Darreh Gaz, on the east by Sarakhs, and on the south by Chul-i-Khaneh. The district has a length of about 70 to 80 miles and a width of about rvnprai foatnrp* 30 miles ’ and is defended by a number of as strong defiles as are to be found in the world. It consists of a series of valleys descending from the ridge to the plain ; those to the westward having a general direction north-east, those to the eastward nearly east-sou’-east. Each valley is confined by precipitous spurs, which fall away in rugged outlines to the lower ranges. These are of inconsiderable height and of easy, rounded outline, being composed for the most paH of clays, chalk, and marls; but they spread a most intricate maze of ravines and glens between the plain and the bases of the main s £ l l tnspurs. The valleys, where they widen out, and many spots in the lower hills are inhabited and cultivated, or are capable of cultivation. Beyond the lower hills extends the hill-skirt, or Atak. So large a portion of this tract n is unoccupied, that a better idea of the real ex- eop e portions. tent and value of the district will be obtained from a detail of the peopled portions only. These are—- Is*.—The valley of the Ab-i-Khur, on the lower course of which stream are the villages of the Chehcheh. 2nd .—The valley of the Ab-i-Mihneh. 3 rd' —X n succession to the west is the principal valley. The plateau of Kalat, the famous natural fortress of Khorasan, lies in it; and its drainage lee ds a fine stream that fertilizes a portion of the Atrak. The stream is known as the Ab-i-Kalat. Beyond this valley is a stretch of broken country extending to the glen of Ab-i-Vard, traversed by two or three inconsiderable streams, on the banks of which are five or six small villages. The plateau of Kalat merits further description. It is an elevated tract of plateau land, of considerable extent, rising Plateau of Kalat. * n p ar t s i n to mountains and traversed by many deep valleys. Enclosing it completely is a chain of heights or ridges, so narrow, lofty, and precipitous as to form a perfect wall, penetrable only at a few points' The cliffs forming this wall, rising from their base as they do to a height of about 1,500 feet above the general level of the country, can owe their origin only to some violent convulsion of nature, acting upon a limited area with sufficient force to elevate and distort the whole surface. Even so, the wonderful completeness and uniformity of the chance disposition of the mountainous masses forming the barrier is beyond all conception—a phenomenon probably without parallel, and of which the most accurate drawings alone could convey any distinct impression. The total length of the plateau from east to west is about 18 miles, and its breadth varies from 6 to 10 miles, giving Extent. an arga o £ gojnewhat i ess than 150 square miles. It slopes for the most part inwards from the crest of the enclosing ridges, and drains into the Kalat stream. This stream, Kalat stream. rising about due south of Kalat in the slopes of the Kuh-i-’Imarat, flows round its southern wall, and enters at the north-east corner by a remarkable natural gap in the rocky boundary, known as the Darband, or defile of Arghavan Shah. The narrowest part of this gap, which has a width of about 40 paces, is closed by gates so constructed as to give free passage to the stream when swollen by floods. The whole length of the passage or gap is about 400 yards, which gives the width of base of the enclosing wall at that point. The crest, 500 feet above the stream, is so narrow that a single man with difficulty finds foothold on it. The principal elevation within the circuit of the plateau is the Kuh-i- Principal elevation in the Khisht in the nt&gt;rth-west corner, which has an plateau. elevation above the valley of 1,500 feet and an absolute height of 4,000 feet. It, together with the whole of the 2 (*2303 KAL—KAL .;v &lt; r., i. y , z plateau in that direction, is formed of chalk filled with marine shells, known as ‘gryphcea: The strata form a bed of about 4,000 feet in thick ness ; and each in succession downward increases in density, the lower attaining the appearance and texture of hard, shelly limestone. The Kuh-i-Karatava lies above the Darband-i-Nafta, supporting a portion of the northern cliffs and rising high above them ; and the Kuh-i-Sirzar in the extreme east. The elevation of the two last cannot be less than 5,000 feet; and their formation does not differ from that of other portions of the plateau. On the south side of the stream is a remarkablv rugged peak rising about 1,000 feet above the valley, formed of red sandstone, with a cap of white limestone of about 150 feet in thickness. The whole circuit of the cliffs enclosing the Kalat plateau cannot be less than from 50 to 60 miles. Their crests form a narrrow ridge slightly serrated, but still of almost uniform height. The interior slope falls away in some places in a sharp, inaccessible incline, in others in long, easy undulations, reaching to the edges of the deep ravines formed by the erosion of the soft rocks that seam the plateau in every direction. Besides the Darband-i-Arghavan Shah and the Darband-i-Nafta, by Gates. which the stream enters and leaves the plateau, and which are practicable for artillery, there are three other gates practicable for horsemen,—the “ Darband-i-Cl'ub Bast,” the “ Darband-i-Kushtani ” and the Darband-i-Dihchi.” Besides these, there are at least four paths, which are just practicable for infantry, viz. :— (1) at a little to the right of where the road from Bardeh (or Vardeh) first comes under the cliffs and turns towards Arghavan ; (2) by the ridge which connects Kalat in the north-west with the mountain system on the south (this path is well known and is called Kuingushi, and leads to Giiu) ; (3) a path immediately under the Sar-i-Karmari Khisht peak ; (4) a path close on the left of the Nafta gate. All these paths are defended by towers, and might easily be rendered quite impracticable. On the northern side of Kalat, there is the Darband-i-Nafta; the hills come down on their sides to within about 60 feet ; and as they are sheer scarps, the only entrance is by the bed of the river, which is closed by a loopholed wall made to let the river run through. In addition to the above defences, every spot where the hill seems to offer the possibility of ascent and there are about 100 practicable for unencumbered and active footmen is either artificially further scarped, or stopped by loopholed walls, while in each little bit of level ground above is a tower. If held in sufficient strength, it would be probably quite impossible to force it, as, in addition to the obstructions in front, the bed of the river is flanked by walls built upon the face of the cliff for a distance of 200 yards or so. Nevertheless, it was, some few years prior to 1875, entered by a party of Tekke Turkomans ; but this must be attributed more to the negligence and paucity of the garrison than to the strength or gallantry of the assailants. There is no doubt that in Kalat is to be found an extremely strong position, in which any number of troops could be collected ; but, with allits strength, it has two very fatal sources of weakness. First, it is situated to the north of an exceedingly difficult range of mountains, across which it would be very difficult to transport supplies ; and, if cut off from its sup plies in this direction, it would not be possible to collect sufficient from the small villages in the district. Secondly, its size is a source of weakness. It would require a garrison far beyond the power of any State to devote to its care. In its present state, with its slender garrison of half-hearted soldiers scattered all over the place, and separated from each other and from all support by miles of difficult and impracticable roads, it is not probable that it would hold out very long against any skilful or determined attack. The garrison consists of two companies stationed at Mesned, woo are ^ . changed occasionally. Two hundred savdrs gxist almost entirely on paper. For some years no artillery has been stationed in the fortress. In Firdausi’s great epic, known as the Shah Ndmeh, the district is refer- red to as Kalat and Charam, the latter being an important village some 6 miles to the west of Kalat. In it a grim tragedy was enacted on the occasion of the invasion of Turan or Central Asia by the forces of Kai Khusran, a legendary monarch of Persia. It was inhabited by his half-brother, Faiud, who was independent, and the Shah enjoined upon Tus, his commander-in-chief, the necessity of avoiding the district. However, it was found that the alternative routes led through deserts, and the Persian army perforce en tered the gorges to the south of the district. Faiud, hearing of the approach of a mighty host, took up his position on a lofty crag, and watch ed the army defile below him. He was accosted by the hero Bahram, who, upon being shown the Kaianian mole on Famd’s arm, reported to Tus that it was the Shah’s brother. Tus, however, cherished sinister designs, and wished' to sack Charam. He consequently refused to acknowledge the identity of Farud, who was attacked. After kill ing various heroes in Homeric style, he retreated to the fort, whence he shortly afterwards sallied out and gave battle, until the whole of his force was exterminated and he himse f was mortally wounded. Return ing to his fastness with difficulty, he was received by his mother, who fired the treasury and hamstrung the horses. The women committed suicide by throwing themselves from the top of the fortress, and, finally, Farud and his mother killed themselves. Tus burst in the gate, to find nothing living inside, but merely a mass of ashes, on which to satiate his thirst for plunder. From the above it does not appear that Kalat was renovmed for its natural strength in the tenth century of our era, when Firdausi lived : nor have we any details as to its occupation by Arghavan Shah : but when blood-drinking Tamerlane strode across the stage of Asia, it won a match less reputation. Tamerlane found Kalat in the possession of a certain ’AH Beg and attempted its capture by surprise. In this he failed, although he seized many flocks of camels and sheep. He then formally invested what is now known as the Nafta darhand in person, his Amirs attack ing the other entrances. Some Badakshani hillmen disco ered a track, up which they effected an entrance, and matters looked black for the510 KAL-KAL \ defenders : but ’ Ali Beg proposed a meeting to arrange the terms of surren der, and took advantage of its being granted to break down this track. Fourteen assaults were then delivered, but were repulsed without difficulty, and the World-Conqueror was forced to retire defeated. Two years later, Amir Shaikh ’Ali, a nephew of Tamerlane, escaladed the natural barrier : but, once there, found himself caught, and when his arrows were expended, was forced to surrender. Shortly afterwards plague broke out and wrought such havoc among the defenders that ’Ali Beg surrendered to Tamerlane, and was put to death. Kalat apparently does not again figure large in the history of Khorasan until the star of Nadir Shah, the last great Persian Conqueror, rose on the murky horizon, and in a few years restored to Persia her dignity and prestige, which the Afghan invasion had, for a while, shattered. Nadir Shah was a glorified robber who was born in the neighbouring district of Darreh Gaz, and throughout hiis career cherished a strong affection for the fortress which was henceforward to be known by his name. After his glorious triumphs in Afghanistan, in India, in Bokhara, and at Khiva, the dread Afshar repaired to Kalat in A.D. 1740, when he commenced fortifying it by building the works which are now to be seen. Nadir cherished a dream that, one day, he would retire to spend his closing years in this safe retreat, and it was here that he stored the untold millions of India with the famous diamond, the Daria-i-Nur ; his family too was sent to live in the same fastness. Fate, however, never permitted the realization of these idle dreams, and Nadir was assassinated in A. D. 1747, and fell, cursed by the whole nation. A nephew, ’Ali Qull Khan, was elected his successor. His first act was to send a band of Bakhtiari horsemen to seize the treasure at Kalat. The carelessness of the garrison, a member of which had neglect ed to pull up the ladder by which means alone there was communication with the outside world, made everything easy, and in a few hours every male descendant of the Conqueror of India was put to the sword. One scion of the house, Shah Rukh, a grandson and but a boy, was spared, in case the nobles clamoured for a member of the royal house ; and with this grim tragedy the account of Kalat-i-Nadiri may fitly be brought to a close, just as grim tragedy ushered it on to the stage of history. Major C. 0. Bruce, who visited the fortress in 1902, describes it as fol lows :— ‘ ‘ Turning the last corner upon leaving the gorge, the traveller is suddenly confronted by the wonderful walls of Kalat-i-Nadiri, rising clear against the sky to a perpendicular height of 700 or 800 feet. It is impossible at first to believe that the upper part of them is not artificial. Rising from the valley are a series of steep, rocky buttresses ; the actual walls ^stand upon these buttresses, and the two together rise abruptly from the bed of the small stresm. Approaching the walls at right angles, the track turns immediately below them sharp to the left, and for another 2 miles runs parallel along the foot of them. Winding down a small, valley, it gradually narrows to the inevitable wall of rock with no apparent opening. Within 200 yards of the rock a narrow gorge can be made out leading through it, which gorge is the method by which the stream' finds its way in. Wading down this we kept close to the sheer wall upon one side ; onek turn to the right, another to the left, and we found ourselves facing the famous Arghavan Shah gate of Kalat. ‘ ‘ Right across the narrow gorge the gateway is built, which bars all entrance to the interior. ‘ ‘ Profiting by Lord Curzon’s example I had decided not to show myself at all at the main gate, so, after a brief stay, we retraced our steps until again outside the entrance to the gorge. Upon either side of the inner gate small mud towers are perched upon pinnacles of rock : I should say both inside and outside, not on either side. These are, of course, useless for defence now. Once outside we took the track leading west under the walls, towards Kakhka, and for nearly three hours followed it down small, winding valleys. Sometimes a low ridge separated us from the walls, but the eye constantly rested upon their summit. By noon we came to a small stream. Opposite to where it approaches closest to the wall, a rugged bluff, which, I believe, forms the south-west corner of Kalat’s enclosure, towers perpendicularly up. Here we halted for our midday meal, lighting upon two wild hillmen hunters. They had just shot two chikor with their antiquated weapons ; the birds were at once purchased at a fabulous price and thus we made friends. The river level is 3,100 feet. So far we had met no one from the time of leaving the gate of Kalat, except one Persian soldier who was riding a donkey, from which he promptly got down to ask for money. He asked a few questions, to which Ata Muhammad gave evasive answers and plied the soldier in return. He belonged to the Kalat garrison, which he said was relieved every three months, and that he had just been to his home close by on leave. My original plan to attempt to get inside Kalat was to employ a native hunter from the mountains as a guide to show me a w T ay to climb in by one of the secret paths : and, for this reason, I had slept the previous night in the village to try and make friends with some of the shikaris. Lord Curzon has left on record the impossibility of finding any native who dare do so, for fear of the known punishment which the Persian Governor, the Khan of Kalat, would inflict upon any one acting in such a capacity. The old lambardar I had spent the night with at Bulghur had promised to act as my guide after the offer of a considerable rew 7 ard, but was, I think, beginning to repent his bargain somewhat. Anyhow, when we halted for our midday meal by the stream he was nowhere within reach, although we had agreed that he should catch us up, after two hours, past the Kalat gate ; for in that vicinity we were to make the attempt to climb in. After waiting, if the climb was to be made that day, there w^as no more time to waste, so I decided to chance the risk of letting our in tention become known, and to try and get one of the shikaris to give the track away. Asking Ata Muhammad, he said there was no harm in trying ; and I told him to offer the men 5 krdns. He asked them quietly if they knew of any tracks, and they said “ Yes ” ; after some hesitation one of them said, if I would go with him alone, he would take me in if I could climb. At 1-15 p.m. we started from the little stream, leaving Ata Muhammad, the ponies, and the other shikaris to await our return. The valley we were in was a very lonely one ; we had not seen even a shepherd312 KAL-KAL all day. From the bed of the stream the shikari took his way over the lower slopes of the bluff north-west, shortly turning north. At the bottom of a rugged ndld and river-bed the actual climb commences. It took tis 1 hour and 35 minutes to scale the walls, and as I have no wish to be taken for a De Rougemont, I prefer not to attempt a detailed description. It is sufficient for present purposes to state that it is the worst climb I have ever attempted in any country, and that it is altogether impossible (a) at night; {b) in wet or bad weather ; (e) without a guide. After f hour’s climbing we reached what I thought, by the overhanging rocks, was nearly the top. On a pinnacle of sheer cliff, perched just like an eagle’s nest, was a small stone fort. From inside it the drop, looking over the front edge was 300 to 400 feet sheer down. The height of the nest was 3,950 feet above sea-level. Its direction, looking out to its front, north-west, its view magnificent. Shortly after passing this we gained the actual base of the upper rock w r all. Outside this, all along, there runs a narrow berm ; the drop, some 1,000 feet but not absolutely precipitous, though nothing could save you if once you slipped. Following this along for 20 minutes, though the distance was not great, we found ourselves GO feet below the real summit —a sheer wall of rock. From this point it was a stiff climb straight in, and at 2-50 p.m. we stood up inside the famous fortress. After a halt to recover and to get back ideas as to what was most neces sary to note, I made, much against the shikari*s wish, for a high bit of ground. J mile north-west of where we had climbed in, and made the following observations: ‘ ‘ For G00 yards along the summit of the walls where we had entered nature has been aided by a stone breastwork, carefully built of hewn stones, varying from 12 to 14 feet high down to 3 or 4 feet, outside ; inside, uniformly about 4 feet G inches high. Along the length of 600 yards there are three towers of stone (in decay), the wall being roughly loopholed here and there. “ The total extent of Kalat-i-Nadiri, inside from east to west, 1 should put at 17 to 18 miles ; from north to south 6 to 7 miles. The south wall, over which we climbed in, runs west-sou’-west by east-nor’-east. “ The interior may be rougniy divided into three distinct parts, as seems to have been done by nature. The west half, centre, and east half. The centre is chiefly a high plateau, which stretches right from the south wall at a height of 5,050 feet to within IJ to 3 miles of the north wall, ending abruptly in two high bluffs, which face north and appear to be 200 to 300 feet above the spot where I took these observations (5,050 feet). This was £ hour’s walk to the east of where we had climbed in, and close to the remains of some ruined buildings, within £ mile of the south walk The extent of the plateau is 3 to 4 miles from the south wall to the bluffs ; general direction south to north. Two to three miles across from north west to east-sou -east, it is cultivated roughly in places, and was being ploughed, when I was there, with the rude Persian wood instrument. The Kalat stream enters Kalat by the Ar'ghavah Shah gate, already referred to, and is said to pass out by the main northern gate in the direc tion of Dushakh. For the first mile from the entrance gate the course of the stream is north, a little west. After the first mile the gorge, by which it entered, opens out into a large valley; the stream first bending east, shortly again north. From the plateau its course cannotbe followed right across Kalat, owing to the high blutts, already men tioned, round the east side of which the stream flows. Along the hanks of the stream, chiefly upon the west bank, upon some flat ground lying between the bluff which faces south, and the stream itself, lies all the cultivation and all the inhabitants dwell there. 1 saw with my glasses (No. 12 most powerful Zeiss), from a distance of 4 or 5 miles, mud huts of the ordinary Persian kind, trees, cattle, natives, and fields under cultivation. The course of the stream was blocked from view when it took a further left-hand course under the bluff. Close to the spot where we lay are some remains of an old building, probably those of the palace, built for his own occupation by Nadir Shah, when that warrior made Kalat his private treasure store. Only the foundation and a few remains of low walls are now left ; these are 18 to 24 inches high. The building had been brick ; now grass-grown mounds 611 up much of the interior space. In rear of the main building are ruins of detached houses, such as servants’ quarters would be. The dimensions of the house itself are 40 yards square ; the whole remains would have covered a piece of ground 70 to 80 yards square. “ There are two other main villages, one of wtiich can be seen from above the Arghavan Shah gate through the go^ge, situated on the slope of main valley. Except for these I believe that the inhabited portion of Kalat is entirely confined to the valley of the main stream, where, the shikari told Ata Muhammed, the Khan’s offices, telegraph and bazar are, as well as the soldiers’ quarters. “ The left half of Kalat lies between the plateau and the west wall. It consists entirely of rugged, wild, small hills and valleys, with the excep tion of one watercourse running from immediately below where we climb ed in, north-west, to emerge by the north-west gate—the Dihchi gate. This watercourse was dry when I saw it, though large enough for a fair stream of water, and its course could be traced almost all across the left portion of Kalat. The natives say it does not run now, as the water has failed. It must once have been fed by springs from close under the south wall upon the inside. In this portion of the interior there is no cultivation of any kind, nor any sign of inhabitants or a village, so far as could be seen. We looked down from the spot where we climbed in upon a network of steep ndlds and small ravines—all sandy, rocky, dry, inhospitable country. The general level of the hilltops and flats, between the ravines, is about 3.950 feet; of the bottom le vel of the ndlds and ravines 3,450 feet. This divi sion of the place is only used as a hunting ground by the native shikaris, who make their way into Kalat by the climb we came. They hunt the wild sheep, the ovis poli, so the character of the country may be im agined. It gave me the impression of a wild ‘ never visited spot.’ The east portion of Kalat, distant from where we were upon the plateau 8 to 9 miles, is the highest part of the interior. Its character is a compro mise between the central and left half portions. Upon the farthest side, near the east and south-east walls, there are ridges, certainly higher than any point upon the plateau. The highest part of Kalat is either there or the most eastern of the two bluffs. By far the larger portion of the interior is uninhabited. Except for the two villages already referred to, the314 KAL-KAL river valley is the only inhabited part. The ground, inside the walls in the east end of Kalat, falls gradually away from the southern and eastern walls at first, after wards rising in parts. In the west it drops immediately from inside the walls ; these forming the edge of a regular basm. lo the north-west and north the walls are considerably lower than those on the sou’-sou’-east and east. Where the dry river-bed runs out to the north west gate they appear lowest. Three mam gates were easily made out from the plateau : that to the north Dushakh, north-west the Ddichi gate and in the south wall the Arghavan Shah gate. The possibility of climbing into Kalat is now established for any one. The shikari with me told Ata Muhammed there were only three such tracks as we had climbed, but there are probably one or two spots where the wa Is could be scaled. The point where Lord Curzon made the attempt could, I think, be made use of, but there and all along the southern ^ wall any one choosing that side must be easily detected by the natives.” f n Maior Molesworth Sykes obtained permission from the Governor- General of Khorasan to visit the famous fortress m lh05, and describes it ^“ItHhape, as the attached plan shows, exactly resembles the profile of a wild boar, its general direction running west-nor -west. The south ern wall already*referred' to is the most uniform m appearance and some 15 miles in length. It is broken at the Darband-i-Arghavan Shah, which represents the boar’s mouth, and again at the south-east extremity there is a second entrance, known as the Kushtam. This latter is situated on a lon^, narrow spur in which the fortress terminates to the south-east, thus continuing the extaordinary resemblance referred to above, the whole of this stupendous wall rises almost sheer to an altitude ol some 2 000 feet. Of this perhaps one-half the distance is chmbable : crest is composed of a black rock, resembling in shape a wedge, which is so narrow on its inaccessible summit that it would be impossible to “Continuing in a west-nor’-west direction from the darfiarid of Argha van Shah, the snout of the fortress is most clearly defined, and the boars eye is the Dihchl entrance |on the north. This side rises at least 3,000 feet above the valley, but struck me as less inaccessible. At the sam time it is only fair to mention that I inspected it from the crest only. _ boar’s back is broken by the Deh Nafta darhand, and through it the river, which enters Kalat-i-Nadiri by the Arghavan Shah darhand flows down to water the fertile oasis of Dushakh. It is known as the I^afta river. ‘ ‘ On the east side there is the fifth darhand of Chub Bast, and, as sta. e above, the fortress ends in a narrow spur to the east. . . ‘ ‘ So much for the circumference, which is perhaps 60 miles in penmet I now turn to the interior. . . ,r ‘ ‘ The life of Kalat centres in the narrow valley some 12 miles m le ^6 which runs approximately from west to east between the Arghavan and Nafta darhands. Almost throughout there is a narrow strip ot cu - vation, which supports some 2,000 inhabitants. Elsewhere t ere are or four small villages dependent on rain crops. What particular y s me w is the hilly nature of the interior. Hills are everywhere, ^ among them being the Kuh-i-Baba Kumaili, which rises to over 6,000 &gt;and more or less fills up the south-east corner. Elsewhere, once the nar row valley is left, the rough track winds across a maze of low hills, so much so that internal communications are extraordinarily difficult. The altitude ®f the main valley is about 3,000 feet, and, partly owing to its shut- in condition, it is extremely hot in summer. The mam water-supply is drawn from the river ; but there are a few small springs of good water. * The climate is unhealthy, and the mosquitoes so active that everyone uses curtains—almost the only corner of Persia where this custom prevails. The darbandoi Arghivan Shah, by which we entered the fortress, is ! by no means strong, and had been recently injured by a flood ; but at every turn, towers or forts supplemented the handiwork of nature, the whole constituting an impregnable position, if held by a resolute force. To-day, however, the darband is garrisoned by a handful of ragged Persian soldiery, who, by their appearance,-constitute a telling proof of the decay of virility which has befallen historic Iran. A few yards beyond the entrance we passed an inscription of Arghavan Shah or Arghun, after whom the darband is named. It is of more than usual interest to recall that it was this monarch who despatched an embassy to Kublai Khan, and was thus instrumental in procuring the return of Marco Polo to Europe, as he alone was acquainted with the sea route from China to Persia, and was also deemed sufficiently trustworthy to take charge- of the lady Kokachin, who, according to the illustrious Venetian, was moulti bele dame et avenant. Arghun Shah, furthermore, sent embassies to the Pope and to the kings of France and England. In 1290 Edw T ard I accredited Geoffrey de Langley to visit the Moghul, with a gift of ‘ ‘ some gerfalcons and other jewels of our land.” ” To resume, passing the inscription, we emerged from the gorge at the^ village of Arghavan^ Shah, which is inhabited by Jalayar and GarashuJ® Turks. Thenceforward there was a continuous strip of cultivation with numerous gardens. After passing a ruined ice-house, whence a track leads to the Dihchi darband, we skirted a hamlet termed Khvarizm Mahalleh. It is peopled by a few families from Khvarizm of Khiva,, planted by Nadir Shah, who, like the monarehs of Chaldea, transported; tribes from one side of Central Asia to another. “Four miles from our camp we reached the Governor’s residence, known as Kabud Gumbad or the “ Blue Dome,” a name derived from its mosque. “We returned his call on historic soil, for he received us in the gardens in which is situated the Tmarat-i-Nadir or “Building of Nadir.” This consisted of a central dome, some 90 feet in height, constructed of a variety of stone resembling Devonian sandstone. The interior of the dome was some 50 feet in diameter, and there were traces of decoration in gold, blue, and black. This central dome of fluted pillars was surrounded by four sets of rooms, each consisting of an arch with a chamber on either side. The whole was cased with marble, which, with the utter disregard to means displayed by Orientals, was quarried in Urumieh, near Tabriz, and transported some 1,300 miles from the western to the eastern frontier of Persia by forced labour, which, as Sir John Malcolm testifies, was the source of much human misery. The stone panels are covered with trees;316 KAL—KAL and birds chiselled in relief : but some of them are plain, thus represent ing an unfinished appearance. Beneath are extensive vaults. This was the famous treasury of Nadir Shah, and the cellars, some 150 years ago, contained more bullion and wealth than any conqueror has amass ed since Alexander the Great rifled the hoards of the Acha3menians, The whole is interesting rather than strikmg, and the design is mean and betrays no grandiose inspiration, such as would be befitting to a thesaurus which includes the Darla-i-Nur or the still more famous Peacock Throne. “ After concluding our inspection, we rode to the northern wall, which, unlike the southern, is hidden from the valley by an interior range. A two hours’ ascent to an altitude of 4,500 feet brought us to the hamlet of Khisht, to the west of which, covering several acres, was the palace in which the family of Nadir Shah was surprised in the manner already re lated. The buildings were of coarse stone, and the rums of a Persian bath were visible, but here again everything presented the same aspect of incompleteness, and the most interesting remains consisted of elaborate masses of masonry, which fi 1 d the steep valleys and were designed to store the water-supply. Indeed, to-day, the villagers depend on these reservoirs, and their crops are fed by the rainfall, there being no spring on these hills. “A second ascent brought us, at an elevation of 6,000 feet, to the highest peak of the northern wall. As may be supposed, the view was superb, and from our point of v ntage we looked down on the great plain of Asia, which stretches in unrivalled monotony to the arctic tundra of Siberia. Almost at our feet lay Dushakh and Kakhka, with the Trans-Caspian Rail way. Tearing ourselves away with difficulty from gazing across the yellow plain, we turned our eyes to the great fort. As mentioned above, the northern face is more regular, and appeared to be less impracticable; but we only saw it from the crest, which is here an easy slope. The lower portion is, however, said to consist of sheer cliff, although certainly one shepherd’s track was distinctly vis ble running up the steep hillside. Looking into the valley, we saw a maze of low hills, which to the south- east terminated in flat-topped Kuh-i-Baba Kumaili. “ We camped at Kabud Gumbad, and, making an early start, rode east down the valley. The river runs between high cliffs, which are united by a remarkable dam, some 90 feet wide and perhaps 250 feet in height. It is constructed of red-brick, and is said to date from a period anterior to that of Nadir. A few miles lower down, ruined waifs marked the site of the once extensive pleasance of the Great Conqueror and, nearing the natural walls of the fort, we passed Deh Nafta, a village inhabited by Kuzai ’Arabs, who were also brought to this Happy Valley by the same master mind. Below, the river runs through cliffs which attain to an unrivalled pitch of sullen grandeur, Nowhere have I seen anything to match ihe impressiveness of this impregnable defile, which repulsed Tamerlane’s repeated onslaughts, and which fully merits the epithet “awesome ” which is applied to it by the Persian historian.” Both the plateau and mountain slopes are entirely devoid of trees and L shrubs. Even the juniper, which is found ^so plentifully on the adjoining ranges, is Vegetation.absent. The surface of the ground is covered, however, with a thick growth of aromatic herbs and grass, sfEording excell nt pasture. The culturable portions of the plateau are of considerable extent. Cultwable tracts. There is first the valley, which has a rich alluvial soil, and, in a belt of 8 miles long by about ^broad, produces all the rice and fruit, silk and cotton that are needed to feed and clothe the whole of the inhabitants. It has an eleva tion of 2,500 feet, and is the only irrigated tract within the enclosure of the plateau. The more level parts of the highlands of the plateau have a fine, light soil that returns crops of from 10 to 15 fold of wheat and barley, with very little labour on the part of the cultivators. Such lands lie at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the level of the valley. The area now under cultivation is small, and its produce does not exceed local re quirements ; but there is unlimited room for extension to meet the wants of any probable future increase of the population. The crops, though dependent on rainfall and dew, never fail save under exceptional visitation of drought. The fact is remarkable, as the rain fall and snowfall on the north side of the mountains, though perhaps, as alleged by the natives, greater than on the south side, can hardly be suffi cient to nourish vegetation, and the high plateau lands are entirely devoid of surface water and springs, owing, no doubt, to the lightness o c the soil, the soft texture of the rocks below it, and the great depth to which the innumerable drainage lines have sunk. Barley, wheat and higffiground rice, cotton, lucerne, melons and grapes Produce. are P roduced in the irrigated valleys of the interior. At present the plateau of Kalatd-Nadirl contains the following eight Population. villages, ins.de the fo tress.

It is hexagonal, with a bastion at each corner each face inside being about 16 yards in length. The foundations seem to be carried down to a considerable depth, also an unusual thing in buildings in this country. There is a spring just below the fort to the west of the hill on which the fort stands, but the fort seems to have been supplied with water from a well. _ i i There are a number of large earthenware jars of a deep red colour and very well made, built into the walls and bastions in all directions. The Sani’-ud-Dauleh, who describes this fort, considers that these jars were meant for the storage of flour, not for water, as a well mside the fort contained water ; but he remarks that this well has no sign of having been artificially made, and looks as if it was natural, there being no mark of pick-axes, etc., in it. The Sani^ud-Dauleh says the water of the spring smells of sulphur, and that the well m his time (1882) was filled up to within 20 zar's (or 68.2 feet) of the top.

KALEH-I-MUR A (also known by the following names : — Shurab, Ab-i- Shur, Kal-i-Shur, Ab-i-Pul-i-Abr!sham, Kal-i-Abrisham)— A river in Khorasan rising in the mountainous district near the Aleh Dagh mountains, flowing west and receiving the drainage of a large tract of country, extending from Jajarm in the west to beyond the eastern limits of the Juvain and Isfaraln plains. One of its tributaries rises on the north-western slopes of the Haidari mountain near Sultan Maidan, and passing the Mar Kuh then runs through the Isfarain plain ; another rises in the mountains between Sultan Maidan and the ’Arbakai district; an other, the Kal-i-Mansura, rises in the Bar-i-Ma’dan district ; others come from the north and the west, and having all joined in the western part of the Juvain plain, north of the Pul-i-Abrisham on the Shahiud- Meshed high road, the united waters are called Kaleh-i-Mura. Most of the tributaries are known by the name of the villages near which they rise. From the Pul-i-Abrisham the river runs southwards ; south of the Shahrud- Turshiz high road it bends a little to the east, and then empties itself into the great depression of Khorasan, the great Kavir. Except in early spring or after heavy rains there is ordinarily but little water in its bed, most of the water of its tributaries being used for irrigation. The water of most of its tributaries is sweet, but from the western part of Juvain downwards the water of the river is very brackish, excepting always in early spring or after heavy rains, when the water is fresh. Bel- lew says—‘ ‘ The river here (Pul-i-Abrisham) carries a good stream of clear, fresh water on a sandy bottom. ” The Fariumad plateau is not drained by this river. The Fariumad stream joins the one which flows down to Mazinan, and its overflow forms the salt marsh in the depression west of Mazinan.— (Bellew ; MacGregor ; Napier; Stewart ; Schindler.)KALEH-I-NAJAF or NAJAFABAD— A large village in the Garmakhan sub-division of the Bujnurd district in northern Khorasan.

A pass, va 11 ey and defile in eastern Khorasan between Meshed and Shahr-K Nau (Bakharz). The pass, which is situated at 13 miles from Gudusha, 11 miles from Shahn-i-Bala, 38 miles from Shahr-i-Nau and 72 miles from Meshed, divides the drainage of the Bakharz district from that of Turbat- i-Shaikh Jam. From the direct'on of Meshed the road to the pass winds by a narrow path over a difficult slope, with the hills closing up on both sides. The summit of the pass is called Gardaneh-i-Kal eh Minar. It abounds in strong'positions, and the road is comp'etely commanded by a very steep, rugged, impracticable ridge, which runs along the leit the whole way. The descent is gradual to the plain for about 8 miles, and is quite good and practicable for artillery. From the direction of Shahr-i-Nau (Bakharz) the road to the pass is, easy. Starting from Shahn-i-Bala the first crest over a ridge is reached at the 8th mile. Thence a slight descent, and a second rise leads to the top. of the Kalleh Minar pass at about the 11th mile. A descent of sonae S 1 or 4 miles on the north side brings one out, through a gorge into a gradually widening valley, with a stream in the centre and grassy sward on either 48 LB. o T330 KAL-KAM side, down whieh tlie road runs till the small Barbari vibage of Chehar Tagan, wh ch is situated at the foot of the pass, is reached at the 18th mile. The range is connected to the west with the Bakharz ridge and first iuns east and west, but to the east of Kalleh Minar it runs more south. It might aptly be called the Jam range. The ascent to the summit of the range is very easy, through a picturesque valley, with trees and water, and bounded by rugged ridges of red stone. This valley affords the most splendid grazing-ground, even in July, and for this reason it is clearly the line that should be taken by the cavalry of a force proceeding to the east, if other things permitted. The defile affords a very strong position. The northern entrance is almost completely shut up by the hill through which the road passes and a few hours’ work here would render this one of the strongest positions that could be found anywhere. The hills on both sides come down and seem to meet, and do actually come within 30 feet of each other. Behind is a semi-detached hill which, rising abruptly and perpendicularly out of the bed of the river, commands the whole valley as far as the range of rifled artillery. The defile is certainly impracticable for artillery as it stands ; but it could easily be made practicable in a few hours, as the s hi of the hi 1 soft. The village of Kalleh Minar has a population of 100 families of Bar bar is, who own 120 cattle and 300 sheep and goats.

A village on the customs frontier of Khorasan, on the main caravan route between Meshed and Herat, situated on a perfectly flat plain, about 15 miles from the Hari Rud and 98 from Turbat-i-Haidarf. It is in the Bakharz district and contains about 150 houses, of which half are inside the fort and the remainder outside. The fort is on the western side of the village and is surrounded by the usual mud wall, about 20 feet high. It is built in the form of a square.with bastions at each of the four angles undone in the centre of each face; The faces are about 100 yards in length. About a £ of a mile to the west of the existing fort are the ruins of another old fort, situated on the top o£ a mound r This mound has an excellent command over the whole of the surrounding country to the north and east, but is itself commanded by a low-lying range of hills about £ mile to the west. The karlz, which sup plies the village with water, flows immediately below the eastern slope of the mound. Kariz has a certain strategic importance owing to its position on the most direct route between Meshed and Herat, and also between Pul-i- Khatun and Sistan. The Russians have a small post stationed here in connection with the quarantine cordon, consisting of a doctor and 6 Cossacks under a 8ub- Lieutenant. There is also a British Agent and 3 saidrs belonging to the Meshed Consulate-General, Herat-Meshed dak service. Half a mile to the north-west, and close to the small village of Sadabad,. is a spacious caravanserai, built and owned by the Mu’avin-ul-Ayala, which is leased to the Russian Loan and Discount Bank, and is used by them as a factory for washing and packing wool, and in which some 200 handsi are employed. The Russian Nadezda Transport Company has also a representative here, Supphes are plentiful and there are altogether some 30 shops in the- village, supplied with Russian goods. The inhabitants possess about 80' cattle,. 500 sheep and goats and 30 camels. There is a plentiful supply of? water from 4 Hrizes, and a considerable amount of cultivation.

KARlZ-I-ZIMA— Ruins, about 2 miles south-west of Kariz-i-’Umar.— {MacLean.) KASHAF ROD— A river of Khorasan, sometimes known as the Ab- : Meshed, which rises in the Chinaran sub-district of Meshed, close to the Chashmeh-i-Gnas. It flows at first in a north-easterly direction, but after it crosses the Kuchan- Meshed road it turns south-east and fl ,ws fn this direction as far as Ak- darband, whence it flows due east to Pul-i-Khatun, where it joins the Hari Riid. It is quite wrong to call this river Kara Su as it is sometimes marked on our maps. The name Kara Su or “ black water ” was given to it by the Tur komans, owing to the belt of tamarisk and thorn jungle that runs along both banks, supplying an almost unlimited supply of camel-graz : ng and very fair horse-grazing. Ibis jungle is especially dense between Langarak and Shurchah or Shurja. As far as Langarak, the river flows in a w de valley, contracting at that village about a mile, enclosed by low hills with higher and steeper hills behind them ; the hills on the north are generally higher and steeper than those on the south. From Langarak on, the valley steadily narrows, till at Baghbaghu the river valley or bed is to all intents and purposes a ndld, the width varying from 25 yards to 1 mile, it being generally enclosed by steep banks 50 to 100 feet high. I here is a very difficult defile between Ak- darband and SLurchah through which the river flows, with the track crossing ,.nd recrossing the river, which is only just passable for horsemen and quite impassable in flood ; the banks are steep and precipitous, the iiver- bed in no place being more than 25 yards wide. Old Akdarband and towers commanding the defile are now in ruins. From Shurchah to Pas Kamar, the river valley is still narrow and shut in by fai ly higli lulls but gradually broadening out towards Pas Kamar. From Pas Kamar to Pul-i-Khatun, the hills on the le t bank get lower and lower, but on ihe right bank get higher, running up to some spurs running out from the Jam hills. The total length of the river is some 130 miles. Ihe quantity and quality of the water in the river between Meshed and Pul-i-Khatun varies in the most extraordinary manner. In places it flows in a stream of 20 yards by 2 feet at | mile per hour, anda few miles farther on it dwindles to a tiny rivulet 4 feet by 1 inch, crawl ing along at about | mile an hour. This is caused by the quantity of water taken out for cultivation, the whole streim be ng frequently diverted for th s purpose, but it soon regains its volume owing to numerous small streams and springs which flow into it. Just below Meshed, from which it is distant about 5 miles, the river flows with fairly open banks, with a volume of some 12 yard? by 1 foot 3 inches up to as much as 4 feet in places. The quality varies quite as strangely : from Meshed to Langaiak it is brackish but drinkable, from here cn it gets salter and salter, till at Baghbagnu it is quite undrinkable, and generally remains so to Akdaiband. Hence it improves owing to large streams of fresh water coming into it and frequent springs. After passing Shurchah it gets worse again ; at Pas Kama • it is brackish but drinkable. The remarks as to quantity and quality refer only to summer and autumn, when the river is at its lowest. The total fall from source to Pul-i-Khatun is 1,787 feet, or 5 9 feet as an average, per mile. Between Pul-i-Khatun and Kuzqan the river is hard to cross except at the recognized crossing places, this is due to the steepness of the banks and the treacherous nature of the bottom, which is generally mud of a quick sand nature. This is specially applicable to the section between Langarak and Akdarband, where it is particularly dangerous. In summer the water is nowhere deep enough to prevent a passage, but in winter it is quite impassable, though, being so narrow, it would be very easy to make temporary bridges. In the upper reaches there are many fords, but below Meshed there are but few, the best and easiest is the one at Baghbaghu. When crossing the Ka^haf Pud it must be borne in mind that there are many canals more or less at right angles to the river, which, in many cases, are much more difficult obstacles than the river itself. The Kashaf Rud valley from Ohashmeh-i-Gfilas to Kuzqan is very densely populated, and cultivated almost without intenupti n, consequently a great quantity of the river water is drawn off for irrigation purposes. To the east of Kuzqan the population is considerably less populous. The Kashaf Rud crosses all the roads coming from Transcaspia, Chehckeh and the east, to Meshed, Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam and Pish Robat. There are three bridges across the river, two north of Meshed on the road to CKhcheh and Dushakh, the third south of that town, near Kuzqan, on the road from Meshed to Pul-i-Khatun. All three bridges are stone and very solidly buiit. Eight miles above I’sma’rlabad (2) the river divides into two arms re uniting again at IsmarTabad (2), forming an island some 8 miles by an average of half a mile, which is partly cultivated. There is a . oad along the river from Meshed. The Kashaf Rud has the o owing tributaries on the r’ght bank : Ab-i-Tureq ,Ab-i-Shirad (called the Sang Bast by Oranoffsky), the KaTeh Minar stieam, the Barash and the Bik Kashmir. On the left bank— Rivers Tulgar, Tukhrmnji, Andiu, Pirzu, Tabatku, and Mazda an. —[Oranoffsky ; Smyth, 1902.)KAS-KAT 340 KASHIDAR— Lat. 36° 55' 30'; Long. 55° 42' 0”.—{Napier.)

KHAF (No. 1)—Lat. 34° 34' 16'; Long. 60° 5' 0'; Elev. 2,800'. The capital of the Khaf district of Khorasan, 117 miles west of Herat and 70 miles south-east of Turbat-i-Haidari. It is situated under a range of bare hills, the Khwaja Yar, which lie to the west of the town, is well supplied with grain and water, and has much cultivation and many gardens in its vicinity. Some of the gardens contain very fine pine trees. It is properly called Rui Khaf or Khaf-i-Pain, in contradistinction to Khaf-i-Bala, which is another name for Nasi abad (vide Khaf district). The population is about 2,000, but must have originally been four or five times as large. Most of the shops and buildings are now in ruins and this is said to have been caused, to a great extent, by the exactions of Darvish ’AH Khan, one of the former Governors, and the usury of the Hindus, of whom there is a small colony in the place. These Hindus all come from Shikarpur, where they have their wives and families, but have been established at Khaf for the last century, fresh men coming and going continually. Their chief trade is money-lending and they ar said to charge 40 to 50 p r cent, per annum, but at the same lime they have small shops and sell groceries, cloth, indigo, etc. The present town of Khaf is said to have been built by Amir Qilich Khan, Timurl, a powerful and semi-independent chief o' the Khaf, Jam, Bakharz,and Zurabad districts, who died at the beginning of the 19th century. It must originally h ve bnn very strong and is surrounded by four walls one within the other : all except the outer wall being sur rounded by a d tch and having double gates. In the centre of the town is the ark, the residence of the Governor. Most of the houses inside the walls are now in ruins, and the whole place now wears a most desolute appearance ; but it must have been a fine building once, and has three large millstone doors, as at Asadabad. The greater par; of the popua'ions, who are marly all limuris and are Sunnis, inhabit the southern portion of the town. The town possesses 1,100 cattle, 6,000 sheep and goats. The total production of wheat and barley in ordinary years (f wheat, J barley) is about 21,000 Indian maunds. A certain amount of tobac o and silk is also produced, the mdlidt on the latter amounting to 22 tumdns per annum. There are 43 watermills and 2 windmills, the burner each gr ndimr from 19 to 20 Indian maunds and the latter 19 Indian maunds, iu 24 hourA The mdlidt is 1,200 tumdns.

According to the Akhal-Khorasan Boundary * Ratifications exchanged at Treaty of il h December 1881 * the northern Tehran on March 1882. boundary of Khorasan is defined as follows :— Beginning at the Hasan Qull gulf the course of the river Atrak serves as the frontier as far as Chat. From Chat the frontier line follows in a north easterly direction, the ridges of the Sangu Dagh and Sagirim ranges, thence extending northward to the Chandir river, reaching the bed of that river at Chaqan Kalek. From Chaqan Kaleh it runs in a northerly direction to ridge of the mountains dividing the Chandir and Sumbar valleys, and extends along the ridge of these mountains in an easterly direction, descending to the bed of the Sumbar at the spot where the Ach Agaian stream falls into it. From this point eastward the bed of the Sumbar marks the frontier as far as the ruins of Medjet Daine. Thence the road to Durrud forms the frontier line as far as the ridge of the Kupeh Dagh, along the ridge of which the frontier extends south-eastward, but before reaching the upper part of the Garmab pass turns to the south along the mountain heights dividing the valley of the Sumbar from the source of the Garmab. Thence taking a south easterly direction across the summits of the Misinu and Chub Bast mountains, it reaches the road from Garmab to Ribad, passing at a distance of one verst to the north of the latter spot. From this point the frontier line runs along the ridge of the mountains as far as the summit of the Dalang mountains, whence, passing on the northern side of the village of Khairabad, it extends in a north-easterly direction as far as the boundaries of Guk Kutal. From the boundaries of Guk Kutal the frontier line crosses to the gorge of the river Firuzeh, intersecting that gorge on the northern side at the village of Firuzeh.f mountains to the most easterly point of the range. From here the frontier line crosses over to the northernmost summit of the Asalm'L range, passing along its ridge in a south-easterly direction, and then skirting round to the north of the village of Kalat'h Ohinar it runs to the point where the Zir Kuh and Kizil Dagh mountains join, extending thence south-east ward along the summits of the Zir Kuh range until it issues into the valley of the Baba Durmaz stream. It then takes a northerly direction and reaches the oasis on the road from Gavars to Lutfabad, leaving the for tress of Baba Durmkz to the east. The treaty of 1893 defines the frontier south-east of Baba Durmaz to the Hari Rud, giving a slight increase of territory to Russia. Details M. B. passes, and runs along the crest of these M.

After the first line insert the following “ For a history of Khorasan see article under_ “ Meshed ”,I KHO-KHO 3 51 are not forthcoming, but roughly beyond Baba Durmaz the frontier line takes a south-easterly direction towards Safar Kaleh, and then it runs to the north-east towards Lutfabad, whence it again takes a south-easterly di rec ’ tion to Kara Dagh. From Kara Dagh it runs to the north of Darband i-Haii Bulan in a south-easterly direction to Darband-i-Chehcheh, whence it takes an easterly direction and runs to Ruknabad, whence it joins the river Tejen or Hari Rud, whioh forms the boundary_ between Russian and Persian territories between Sarakhs and Pul-i-Khatun. The Kal-i-Khlleh marks the Perso-Afghan Boundary from the Hari Rud, to Hashtadan. South of Hashtadan as far as Chah-i-Sagak the boundary is not defined, but is supposed to run across the Namaksar, and thence first in a south-easterly and afterwards in a southerly direction towards Chah-i-Sagak. From Chah-i-Sagak the frontier line continues to run in a southerly direction as far as Siah Kuh, a hill in the north of Sistan. Here it follows the Sistan boundary as defined by Colonel A. _H. McMahon in 1903, viz., a straight line from Siah Kuh at Sh dghamij thence in a straight line to the most western of the mounds oi Tappeh- -Kurki, thence in a straight line to the most western of the mounds of Tappeh-i-Shahirakl; thence in a straight line to Tappeh-i-Tilai; thence in a straight line separating the hamlets of Deh ’All Mardan on the west from Deh Ali Jangl on the east to the Shila-i-Shamshiri, leaving Deh Hasan Kharut on the east. The boundary then follows the left bank of the water channel which joins the Shila-i-Shamshirl near to Deh Hasan Kharut, until a point near Deh Yar Muhammad, where the Sikhsar has been diverted towards the west to form this channel. Thence it follows the Sikhsar and Nad-i- 5 Ali channels to the point of separation of the Kad-’.-’Ali and Rud-i-Parian ; thence along the Helmand to the Band- ! -Kuhak and thence in a straight line to the °hill known as Kuh-i-Malik Siah, in the range dividing Sistan from the desert of Kirman. From the Kuh-i-Malik feiah the line may be said to go to the fort of Nasratabad, Sipi and thence, according to Khanikoff, the boundary goes to Deh Saif on the road from Kirman to Sistan. It then crosses the desert called Dasht-i-Lut, touching the hill Naiband and passing west of Pusht-i-Badam, which belongs to Tabas (Khorasan). From this a line drawn through the Dasht-i-Kavir to Pul-i- Abrisham near ’Abbasabad will give the boundary in this direction. The western boundary runs from Pul-i-Abrisham towards Kuh-i-Khush Yailaq and thence to Qalpush, whence it continues to run in a northerly direction till it reaches the Atrak river. The extent of the country thus described would be on the average about 500 miles in length from north-west to south-east, and a little over 300 miles in average breadth, having an area of 150,000 to 200,000 square miles. The whole of Khorasan, with the exception of the tracts immediately bor dering on the desert, is essentially moun- Nature of the country. tainous ; and the ranges of the province can be traced to belong to one system, which is connected with and commences from the continuation of the Elburz range north of Shahrud. Starting from the mountain as known the Shahkuh, the ridge runs past the Chilchillan and the Shahvar Kuh, and Mountains. thence by the Abri Kuh, to the Khush Yailaq.352 KHO—KHO From this it contijiues in a north-easterly direction to the Kuh-i-Kurkhud opening out for a space on the Broad, undulating slopes of the Qalpush plain and the Dasht-i-Armutli, whose elevated plateaux form the water shed between the drainage of the Gurgan and the Kaleh-i-Mura system. So far, the range throws out no great spurs, except that of the Kuh-i- Jehan Mftra, which leaves it above Shahkuh and runs towards the Caspian. On the north the range descends steeply to the basin of the in a southerly direction as far as Siah Kuh, a hill in the north of Sistan. Gurgan; and on the south spurs, viz., those of the Kuh-i-Baba and Kuh-i-Buhar, are short and unimportant. There is, however, a ridge, which may be called the Maiamai ridge, that would seem to have its origin in a spur, which, starting from Khush Yallaq, bounds the valley called Pusht-i-Bustam on the south, runs east of Bustam and then, turning nearly due east, is broken up into more or less disconnected ridges round Maiamai —where, however, there is an apparently isolated peak, which rises to a height of 6,000 feet above the sea level. From the Kuh-i-Kurkhud the main range runs on, under the name of “Aleh-Dagh,” south-west of Bujnurd, past the Darband-i-Firuzeh, to the Kuh-i-Takht-i-Mirza, whence a spur, called the Kuh-i-Saluq, which encloses the Shaughan valley in the-south, is thrown out to the south-west. From the Aleh Dagh other spurs run down towards the Atrak, one of which en circles the Bujnurd basin on the north; while from the Takht-i-Mlrza (“The Prince’s Seat”) rises the ridge, which encloses it on the south. From“ The Prince’s Seat” the main range runs east by south, and then south-east, and under the name of the Kuh-i-Shah Jehan bounds the Kuchan valley in the south, and under that of Kuh-i-Binalud lies to the south of the Meshed valley. At this point it will be well to consider the range which runs along the whole northern frontier of Khorasan. Its connection with the range now being described is maintained by a watershed thrown out from the northern range at the Hazar Jarib near the Kuh-i-Tahmasp, and forming a ridge between the valleys of Radkan and Ja’afarabad. From the Kuh-i-Tahmasp the range runs east-south-east and west-north-west. In the latter direction it opens out into a high undulating plateau, called Maidan-i-Khuni, and then runs past Kuh-i-Duz, round the head of the Duringar drainage, to a point above Askhabad. Th; nee it continues in one unbroken line to close on to the Caspian, where the old bed of the Oxus is supposed to have entered that sea. The east part is called the Qaran Dagh ; the western, the Kupeh Dagh. On the north this range, as far as is known, throws out no large spur ; but on the south there are some considerable offshoots between the Sunt and the Chandir, and between the latter and the Atrak, also, one which divides the Kushkaneh valley from that of Ziristan. From the point above Askhabad, noted, the ridge changes its character to the extent that, whereas west of that point the main spurs are thrown out to the south, east of it they are thrown out to the north. The first of tiles'! is a ridge, which runs parallel with the main range, and, bounding the Duringar valley on the north, is known at its end, if not throughout its whole length as the Zarrin Kuh.Passing by a minor spur, which goes from the Kuh-i-Duz between the drainage of Duringar and Mahmudabad, a spur is met with, which, start ing from the head of the Zangalanlu river runs east, parallel with the main range, and then turns sharp to the north-west, enclosing the Darreh Gaz basin. Over this range lies the Allahu Akbar pass ; between Zangalanlu and Darreh Gaz it is called the Kara Juqar. We may now take up this northern range again from the Kuh-i-Tahm- asp whence its course is east-south-east. On the north it throws out steep spurs between the various rivers—as between the Zangalanlu and Tirgan, the latter and the Lain; and again, between the Lain and Igdaliq. The next spur is one which is crossed at the Guk Kutal, and which runs to the north and then east, round the west and north sides of Kalat-i-Nadiri; while another comes from the main range west of Vardeh, and enclosing that valley on the north, is crossed by the Mirza Kushti pass on the road to Kalat, and then twists round to the north, throwing out ramifications, which form the south and east sides of Kalat. From the Kutal Diveh Buyun* where the range is called the Kara Dagh (“ Black mountain’.’), the spurs on both sides become more and more insignficant; till at Mazdaran the range forms a knife-like crest, with no offshoots at all; and above Shurja it dies away in undulations, terminated by the Tejen. Turning now to the main southern range at a point west of Meshed, where it is called Kuh-i-Binalud, there is only one spur calling for notice. This is one which runs out from about Sultan Maidan to the south, andj dividing the drainage of the Kaleh-i-Mura system from that of Nishapur* turns west and forms the ridge known as the Juvain or Jaghatai ridge! This bounds Sabzawar on the north, and is connected by a ridge the crest of which is said to be 4,295 feet above the sea, and which divides Nishapur from Sabzawar, with another ridge, called Kuh-i-Mish, which cuts off the Sabzawar plain from the great desert. We no&gt;v come to a point in the main range, where to the south of Meshed it gives a very decided dip ; so much so that it may be almost said that a new range commences south of Sharifabad. Still, as in going south-east from Nishapur to, say, Fariman, there is a distinct ascent over a ridge, it may be considered that here is the link that connects the mountains of northern Khorasan with those on the east. From this watershed the Kuh-i-Surkh ridge runs off to the west, bounding Nishapur on the south ; and farther south, either from the ridge. crossed north of Robat-i-Safid, or from the Gudar-i-Rukh or Muhammad Mirza, a ridge runs out to the east, dividing the drainage of Sar-i-Jam from that of Jam.^ From this ridge originate the hills called Qad-i-Shamshir or Kuh-i-Kughar and Kuh-i-Chehil Sang, which drain on the one. side to Meshed and on the other to the Jam river. From the Gudar-i-Rukh the range turns west, round tiie head of the Qalandarabad drainage to the Gudar-i-Baidar, where the ranges of Kuh- i-Na^ir to the west and Kuh-i-Buras to the east join. From the Gudar-i-Baidar the range runs south-east, separating Bakharz from Turbat. On the east it throws out no important spur, the hills sloping 48 I. B. * Vide “ Diveh Bunnell.” 2Y351 KHO-KHO easily towards Himmatabad and Shahr-i-Nau ; though there is a low rid&lt;?e intervening between the latter and Meshed-i-Riza. From this point a ridge is said to run round the head of Turbat, and to be continuous with the Kuh-i-Azqand, which bounds the Turshiz plain on the north. From the west of Shahr-i-Nau the range runs on to the south-east, dividing Khaf from Meshed-i-Riza. There is no doubt that it goes on south to Kariz and is the same range crossed between Ghurian and Khaf, of which the Kuh-i-Sang-i-Dukhtar is a spur, and on which is the Kuh-i-Dushakh. This range runs parallel with the Hari Rud, and ends in the Herat valley. This terminates the eastern branches of the range, but its western * ramifications are less clearly defined. It is, however, very probable that the part of the range near Khaf is connected with the hills about Tun by the intermediate spurs of the Kuh-i-Sinu and the Kuh-i-Khaibar. As suming this connection, we will continue the description from this point. From Tun the range runs south-east; and before reaching the latitude of Kain, it throws out a spur, over which is the Gudar-i-Gud pass, Thence it turns more east round the head of the south drainage of Kain. and is crossed by the Gudar-i-Khunuk ; shortly after which it throws out to the south-east a spur called the Kuh-i-Gazik. But the main range now turns south and a little west to the Samand-i-Shah pass, from which a spur goes south-west to the north of Birjand, and eventually dies away in the desert. The main range is continued in the Kuh-i-Mianabad, which bounds the Birjand basin on the north-east, and is crossed by the road between Is- fizar and Darmian. Running south-east from the Samand-i-Shah pass * to the south of the above pass the range then turns south ; and is crossed by the Gudar-i-Gandeh Kuh between Sistan and Birjand. After this it throws out a spur, called the Kuh-i-Baqaran, wdiich bounds the Birjand valley on the south, and probably dies away in th,e desert near Khusf. Finally, we will return to the point where the Tun range is connected, as it is supposed, with that of Khaf, and trace the west and north ramifica tions of this range. In the first place, the range runs north in the direction of Bijistan, near which it probably ends in the desert. To the west it throws out spurs as far as Tun—all of which end in the desert. This leaves the mountains about Tabas unconnected with the Khorasan system, though further exploration may perhaps show that they are continuous with the range to the north of Yazd. Khorasan cannot boast of many rivers ; and those that there are are , mostly small. The most important is the Atrak, which rises to the north-east of Kuchan and flows into the Caspian ; the Gurgan, which also flows into the Caspian ; the Kashaf Rud or Ab-i-Meshed, which joins its waters with those of the Hari Rud ; andthe Kaleh-i-Mura, of which the KaraSu is a tributary, which, rising in the Isfarain hills south of Bujnurd, flows south between Shahrud and Sabzawar and loses itself in the great salt desert. All the other rivers are mere torrents, which, though they have often a perennial jsupply near their source, are so much drawn on by irrigation, that it is only in flood that they have sufficient water to reach their last resting-place in the thirsty desert.Regarding the drainage beds of the torrents already referred to on the Drainage west of the Tun range, the largest bed is that of Khusif, which collects its waters from the Muminabad and Baqaran ranges and turns south towards Kirman. On the east, all the drainage of the tract called Sar-i-Jam and the east drain age of the Bivazhan run into the Kashaf Rud. The drainage of Mmbuluk, Kaln, and of Khaf-i-Pain goes to the Daqq-i-Dualan; that of the Zir Kuh tract, which includes all to the feast of the Kuh-i-Ahangaran range, compris ing Gulvardeh, Shurab, Yazdan, and Kaland, drains to the Daqq-i-Qarsh Ab close to the Kuh-i-Kabuda, that of Furg, Darmian, Avaz, Tabas, drains to the Daqq-i-Tundi in the Dasht-i-Namadi. Should a Russian force be disembarked near Askhabad, there is nothing Political im rtance P revent occupying the whole of Khora- p ‘ san ; whilst, by seizing the important position of Shahrud-Bastam, they could cover their flank by virtually cutting Persia in half. The Persians do not seem to recognize its importance, and nothing has been done to protect it. It lies so near Ashurada that it could be immediately seized by the Russians. There is plenty of water in the height of summer for a force of 60,000 men ; the district is very productive, and it would be impossible to invest it, if properly fortified. After seizing the Shahrud-Bustam defile, the force would advance up the valley of the Gurgan and over the Kafar and Sultan Maidan passes on Meshed. This is by far the easiest route, and probably available for wheeled traffic beyond Chohar Deh. Political Divisions, follows :— 1 . Bakharz. 2 . Bam-Safialad. 3. Bujnurd. 4. Darreh Gaz. 5.

Anything worthy of the name of a fortification does not exist on the Persian Border ; the forts are mere ruined towers. Khorasan is inhabited by a great variety of races ; only the portion Inhabitants fy in g near the northern and southern roads from Meshed to Tehran being occupied by Persians.

The figures given under the head “ Annual Revenue ” have been obtained from the official revenue papers for the year 1889-90, since when there has been no change in the revenue. 3 . The figures given under the head “ Annual Outturn ” are based on figures given under the head “ Annual Revenue,” which (Annual Revenue) represents one-eighth of the total outturn in all districts, with the exception of a few, where the proportion is different. The number of ploughs generally form the basis of the assessment of revenue in Khorasan. The outturn of one plough, though varying at different places, is, on the average, 20 kharwars per annum, and the average rate of revenue levied by Government annually on each plough is 4| iu/ndns in cash. 2J khanvdrs of chopped straw, and 2| khaiwdrs of grain in kind. The total outturn is, therefore, eight times the revenue grain in all districts in Khordsdn, except Darreh Gaz, Kain. Khusf, and Tabas, where the whole revenue is levied in cash ; Sarakhs, where the revenue is remitted ; and Juvain, Bam, anl Safiabad, where the rate is different, the greater part of the revenue there also being received in cash. 4 . The figures given under the heads “ Required for Consumption of People ” and “ Excess for Export ” are approximate, native sources of information having mainly to be relied upon. The excess is probably under, not over, the true figures. 5. The quantity of grain exported to Russian territory (Trans-Caspia) is estimated at 40,000 kharwdrs or 317,070 Indian maunds, i.e., 4,000 kha wdrs from Bujnurd. 30,000 from Kuchan, 5,000 from Darreh Gaz, and 1,000 from Sarakhs. 6 . The best season for procuring supplies is the end of summer. In J muary less than half the quantity is procurable. Kuchan and Shirvan are the main depots for exports to Trans-Caspia, the business being systematically conducted by Armenians employed by capitalists in Russia. The Agents advance money to the peasants, collect their grain after the harvest, store it at the depots, and export when the Trans-Caspian market is favourable.368 KHO-KHO Table showing the resources of the Astarabad, Shahrad-Bustam, Samnan, and Damghan districts .— Transport animals.

(a) Trans-Caspia imports from Kuchan, Bujnurd, and Darreh Gaz. (ft) The requirements of Meshed are heavy from Kuchan, Kishapur, and the districts east of Meshed. (c) The Tehran pilgrim route is supplied from Bujnurd, Isfarain, and Nishapur. (d) The Jajarm, Shahrud-Bastam • from Bujnurd, Isfarain, and the Guklan country ; Samnan from Damghan ; Yazd from Bujnurd and Isfarain. Thus, the grain-producing centres being (intheorderofimportance) Kuchan, Bujnurd, Isfarain, Chinaran. Darreh Gaz, and Radkan, supplies necessarily radiate therefrom to the surrounding less-favoured districts producing thereby several great currents of grain traffic, one north to Trans-Caspia ; another east to Meshed, a third .south to the pilgrim route, a fourth south-west to Shahrud, with its two branches to Samnan and Yazd Trans-Caspia takes the largest share of the surplus, and its steady demand for cereals has given an enor mous impetus to the grain production of Khorasan. At present the surplus of Kuchan, Bujnurd, Isfarain, Chinaran, Radkan, etc., is competed for by Trans-Caspia and those districts in or adjoining Khorasan, where the out-turn of grain is insufficient for local requirements, but there is little doubt Russia could obtain a much larger proportion of the surplus if she were prepared to pay the price. The introduction of cotton has not yet materially affected the cultivation of grain. In Kuchan and Bujnurd the climate has been found unsuitable, and in those districts where its cultivation is regarded more favcura hie, for instance, in Darreh Gaz and Nishapur, the development has not progressed at the expense of the grainers. It would seem, indeed, that a greater area of land has been placed under the plough,not that cottonhas oustedthe wheat and barley. September 1890.370 KHO—KHO Mineral productions. The mineral products of Khorasan consist of turquoise mines at Ma’dan, near Nishapur. Salt is found all over it in the shape of a thick efflorescence ; and iron, lead, alum, gold, and copper are said to exist. Coal is said to exist in large quantities in the hills some 20 miles to the south of Meshed. Coal certainly does exist, as small quantities are occasion ally extracted for use of the electric engine in the Meshed shrine : it is said to be of fair quality, though rather friable. I can express no opinion as to its quantity, as no proper examination has been made of the coal-field : the Persian, who has the present right to work this coal, told me that the coal-fields are of many square miles extent, and that the only reason they have not been worked more extensively before is that steam pumps would be required to keep down the water that rapidly fills up any excavation. Two copper mines are being worked, one in the Sabzawar, the other in the Turbat-i-Haidari district. , . T , The animal products are horses, camels. Animal products.. -« ^ r sheep, and oxen* The produce of Khorasan consists of fruit in great variety and most kinds Produce § ra ^ n 5 some silk, saffron, large quantities of assafoetida, and cotton ; also manna, tobacco, pistachio nuts, and gums. The manufactures of this province consist of the celebrated Khorasa i sabres, fire-arms of superior make, stoneware, carpets of considerable fineness, namdehs, woollen clothes, cotton goods, pushtins, or sheepskin pelisses, velvets, armour, etc. Owing to cessation of raids and robberies, maintenance of peace and increased facilities of traffic with foreign countries,the trade of Khorasan has expand ed considerably during the past 15 years. An idea of the amount of ex pansion may be obtained from the fact that the customs-dues of Khorasan, which were farmed in the year 1868 j for tumans 7,000, have gradually increased to tumans 100,000 in 1898, The imports from foreign countries are as follows :— Manufactures. Trade and commerce. From India. Tea, indigo, coffee, spices, piece-goods, muslin, cotton, yarn, twist, cop^ per, tin, glass, books, cutlery and pans. From Russian territory. Tea, sugar, candles, kerosine oil, paper, piece-goods, iron, steel, brassy lead, tin, matches, furniture, glassware, chinaware, gold lace, cutlery, haberdashery, fancy goods, cotton, yarn, twist and tobacco, Merv and Bukharan carpets, camel-hair cloth, hides, skins, leather, and saddlery.

Pushtins, harah cloth, carpets, woollen bags, sheep and lambskins, pistachios, manna, and seeds. * The import of aniline dyes is now absolutely prohibited. The exports to all foreign countries consist of silk, asafcetida, wool, cotton, cumin seeds, fresh and dried fruits, shawls, carpets, 'pushtins, tobacco, skins, and leather. Up till 1897 the British trade with Khorasan, and with Central Asia through Khorasan, was much above the Russian trade in value, but the position has now been reversed. This is due to various causes, such as the introduction by the Russian Government, on their Trans-Caspian frontier, of the new customs regulations by which all Europeans and Anglo-Indian goods am excluded fom the Central Asian markets, with the exception of a few articles which Russia cannot produce or provide ; the diversion of the Indian trade in articles admitted into Russian territory from the Bandar Abbas route to the Batoum route ; and the careful study of Persian tastes T - - L 11 11 succeeded in an market. * ;S trade with d as a distri- i market, irkistan, and &gt;atoum. route ade by giving ;rent districts been crowned have no such ied by long, ., and having lost ground, and Bidtish Administration.

After “ tumans 100,000 in 1898 ’ ’ add :— /j'' “ In 1910-1911 the total value of British trade into and out of Khorasan was estimated at £385,000, and in 1911- 1912 at £486,126 ; which represents a tairly large proportion of the total British trade of Persia, namely £3,071,579, and £3,773,005 for the two years mentioned, respectively. Much of the trade of Khorasan is carried on by the Nushki route, as that is one of the safest for caravans. The figures for 1910, 1911, and 1912 were:— imports, £59,688, £42,925, £89,921, and exports for the last two years £8,159 and £12,883, respectively. Russian trade with Khorasan has nearly doubled in the last seven years, and is still (1912) increasing rapidly. In 1910- 11 imports and exports totalled £1,875,758, and in 1911- 12 £2,376,191. The exports, as is always the case, exceed the imports by a substantial amount. 'N. (Sykes.)KHO-KHO 371 From Afghanistan.

Up till 1897 the British trade with Khorasan, and with Central Asia through Khorasan, was much above the Russian trade in value, but the position has now been reversed. This is due to various causes, such as the introduction by the Russian Government, on their Trans-Caspian frontier, of the new customs regulations by which all Europeans and Anglo-Indian goods ar) excluded fom the Central Asian markets, with the exception of a few articles which Russia cannot produce or provide ; the diversion of the Indian trade in articles admitted into Russian territory from the Bandar Abbas route to the Batoum route ; and the careful study of Tersian tastes and requirements by Russian manufacturers, who have thus succeeded in ousting many articles of British manufacture from the Persian market. The commercial importance of Khorasan depended not on its trade w r ith Russia, but on that with India, as Meshed, its capital, served as a distri buting centre for Anglo-Indian goods for the Central Asian market. The exclusion of Anglo-Indian goods from Bokhara and Turkistan, and the diversion of the trade from the Bandar Abbas to the Batoum. route have', howmver, divested Meshed of that importance. The efforts of the Russian Gov ernment to increase their trade by giving subsidies, making roads, establishing consular agencies in different districts of Khorasan, and affording other facilities to their traders have been crowned with success. On the other hand, British and Indian traders have no such facilities. They are handicapped by their goods being carried by long, difficult, and expensive journeys before they reach Khorasan, and having had to work under many great disadvantages, they have lost ground. For these reasons the Russian trade has steadily improved and Bihtish trade has steadily declined.

Delete the present entry under Population and insert :— “ The population of Khorasan is perhaps 1,500,000 to 2,000,000. Meshed, the capital of the province, and the most sacred city of Persia, has a permanent population of 80,000 and is visited by 50,000 or more pilgrims every year. During 1910 and 1911 the number of pilgr ims was rather less on account of disturbances.” ( 1 i Si 31 A376 KHO—KHO of Khorasan : these ‘ field ’ guns are rifled muzzle-loading guns, about 9 pounders. Their ammunition, equipment, harness, etc., is of the most primitive type, and no horses are kept with them (for instance, the 49 horses belonging to the Meshed gnns are permanently at Radkan for the grazing). There are also about 4 brass mountain guns, of very small size—about 4 pounders—as the gun and carriage can be all put on one horse. These seem much newer than the field guns.— {Kinneir ; Malcolm ; Fraser ; Chesney ; Gibbons ; War Office, Persia, Part I \ Mac Gregor ; Napier ; Condie-Stephen ; C. E.

It contains 1,800 to 2,000 inhabitants, and is about 30 miles from Birjand on the road to Tabas, being the first village of the latter district. It has an old fort, but the village is outside it. On two sides of the village are steep cliffs, about 20 feet high. At the foot of the cliffs, which are very abrupt and have only two paths, there is stagnant water in large pools of considerable depth. Just beyond these pools the ground rises a little, and on this rising ground the village is built. On a third side of the village, where there are no cliffs, is a salt marsh of considerable extent—so that the village would present great difficulties to an attacking force without artillery. Good water is obtainable, and supplies in fair quantities.— (MacGregor, Stewart.) . &gt; • KHOR (No. 1)— A group of villages in Khorasan on the road from Yazd to Nishapur and 21 miles from Badrashkand.

The principal village is built on steeply-sloping ground over the valley, which is here very narrow and bounded by steep, bare mountains.— (Gill.) KHUR (No. 2) or KHAUR— Lat. 36° 36' 0' ; Long. 60° 12'0'.—(Aajner.) A village and pass in Khorasan, on the road from Meshed to Kalat-i- Nadiri by Qaratigan. The road here is very difficult and stony. The vil lage contains some 100 houses : it lies at the head of the Chehcheh valley, 38 miles by road from Kalat. The stream from which the pass takes its name runs from west to east; and after passing through a rocky fissure one-third of a mile in length, loses itself in a swamp, 20 miles beyond new Chehcheh. , The village is situated in the Kara Dagh mountains at the source of the Khurchai stream. By an agreement arrived at between the Russian and Persian Governments, the inhabitants of this village are never to exceed the number of 300, families. The land allotted to them for cultivation reaches from Khhr fort northward as far as Darband, which is situated south of the Nakifort. Only one-third of this land may be cultivated every year.Shaltuk (rice), may be sown, but tbe amount shall not exceed three Jcharwdrs. Til (sesamum), cotton, and melons may be raised within the same limits. No water may be taken to the level ground in the Khur pass (vide “ Khurchai ”). In 1894 the population consisted of 300 Persian families who owned 500 cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats. The annual production of wheat and barley in normal years is 13,500 and 4,500 Indian maunds, respec tively.— (MacGregor ; Perso-Russian Agreement, 1884 ; Oranoffsky, 1894.) KHtRASHAH, KHARAQSHAH, or KHCD-I-SHAH— One of the villages forming the Chehar Deh group of Sankhas. It is situated 1 mile north-west of Sankhas and has a wall with 8 towers, 2 mosques, five gardens, and 4 mills. Its population consists of 150 fami lies of which 60 are Saiyids.— (Napier \ Schindler.) KHURCH— A village in north-eastern Khorasan, situated about 3 miles south of the village of Radkan. It contains about 70 families of Kurds, who own 50 cattle and 100 sheep and goats. The normal annual production of wheat and barley is 4,050 and 1,800 Indian maunds, respectively.— (Oranoffsky, 1894.) KHUR CHAI— A stream in Khorasan, which, rising near the village of Khfir, from which it takes its name, flows in a nor^h-easterly direction through the Chehcheh pass, where it is locally known as the Chehcheh, and falls into the Tejen. Until lately most of the water of this stream has been ex pended in irrigation before it reached the Tejen; but in 1884 an agreement was ratified by the Persian and Russian Governments to the effect that, in the first place, the canals irrigating;the cultivation north of Darband should be at once destroyed, and the cultivation of this neighbourhood put a stop to ; secondly, that there should be a restriction of the number of inhabitants ' in the villages of Khur at the source of the stream Chehcheh and AmLabad. From the Harim pass to the entrance of Darband only one bank of the stream was to be cultivated yearly, and only one channel was to be used to irrigate this cultivation. After harvest the water of this channel was to flow back to the stream. The cotton and melon cultivation of Chehcheh was curtailed to an amount not exceeding 100 mans. No shaltuk (rice) crops w re to be permitted. Throughout the entire length of the Chehcheh -pass, i.e., between Darband and the village of Amirabad, where the Ab-i- Garm joins the Khur, there was to be no cultivation at all. No portion of the water of the Ab-i-Garm was to be diverted. These and several similar conditions were evidently made by the Russian Government with a view to the water of the Khur being economised, and to enable a sufficient amount to reach the Tejen. This water-supply between Mihna and Sarakhs would greatly facilitate the movement of troops across the desert, through which the Askhabad-Sarakhs road passes.

The numbers of houses in these villages are rather uncertain, but ac cepting them, and taking an average of 50 houses for those not specified, gives a total of 1,670 houses, and 6,680 inhabitants, consisting of Nakhls, Zanguis, and Persians, of which the NakhI tribe predominate. Khusf is the head-quarters of the Nakhi tribe, which used to be govern ed by its hereditary chief. The tribe numbers Nakhi tribe. perhaps 5,000 souls, some of whom live in Chahak and the hills around. They fancy themselves somewhat as fighting men, and boast that they used to beat the Balfxchis when they raided up as far as Khur from SIstan. I saw a few good men, but the majority did not strike me as being superior to the Persians of this part. The Zangui tribe belongs properly to Tabas. Thus at Khfir half the _ population being Zanguis and half Nakhis, and Zangm tn e. Khtir being a frontier village, half the revenue goes to the Amad-ul-Mulk, the Governor of Tabas, and half to the chief of Kain. It is not a great corn-growing country, but is said to contain 45,000 •sheep and 1,000 camels. The revenue of the Khusf sub-division is tumans 2,680 per annum .—{Mania Bakhsh ', H. D. Napier.) KHUSF (No. 2) (River)—' A river in Khorasan, having its rise in the mountains between Birjand And Tfin, and losing itself in the desert of Lilt. This river has little440 KHU—KHU water, and the little it has is completely absorbed by the field’irrigation of the district; but its dry bed traverses the entire length of the desert. Water has never been seen in this bed—within the memory of man. Even in the most rainy seasons, the current hardly ever goes beyond r the limit of the inhabited portion of the country ; and yet this channel is too deeply cut in the desert soil to allow of its origin being attributed to some meteorological accident. The bed evidently owes its origin to the gradual and continued action of flowing water : which leads to the belief that , the level of rivers and streams has long ago considerably sunk, and t ■ that in consequence the total quantity of Sweet water has diminished ; in this part of the old world, and the desert has enlarged its limits.— (Khanikoff.)

On the plain between the Gurgan and the Atrak rivers, about 3 miles from the right bank of the former from opposite Oba-i-Hatim Mulla Atehbal, 4 or 5 miles east of Ak Kaleh, the depression is shallow and not so well marked, but on the southern bank of it stretches a long, low mound extending in one straight line into the hori zon both east and west, the exact bearings being 64° east and 244° west. The mound is full of large, thick bricks, and there can be no doubt that it marks the remains of an ancient wall.

KUCHAN (No. 1) (District)— The chiefship of Kuchan is the most flourishing and populous in the Kuchan: district of Khora,an. It extends north-east from Extent and boundaries. the border of Bujnurd, 50 miles, to the border of Radkan, the district of the Kaivanlu Kurds, and from the crest of the Atak range, south-west, about 40 to 50 miles, to the watershed of the Shah Jehan mountain, where it borders on Bam-Safiabad, and Isfarain ; a total area of about 2,000 to 2,500 square miles. MacGregor estimates the area of this district at about 3,500 square miles. Its western boundary runs about north from the border of Isfarain, and passing 14 to 15 miles east of Bujnurd, includes the Kushkaneh plateau, and strikes the Atraknear Yangi Kaleh. Thence th' northern bonndary follows th ‘ Atak crest to a point 8 to 10 miles west of Duringar, and nearly opposite Anau. The eastern boundary runs from the south-east to Kaleh Yusuf Kban, and across the plain to the border of the Sultan Maidan. The whole of these boundaries are tolerably well defined. The area above given includes the whole of the fertile plain of Kuchan pj a i n&gt; and Shiivan, which has a total length from Kaleh \ usuf Khan to the Tang-i-Raza-abad of 50 miles, and an average width of about 20 miles, making in all 1,000 square miles. This level plain occupies nearly the centre of the district. North the Mountains north. slopes rise easily into the wide, open, ravine-cleft P latea ux which reach to the A: ak crest, and de scend in an abrupt, rugged wall, supported by buttress-like spurs, into the plain. A central line of rocky peaks traverses these plateaux from north-west to south-east. To the south the slopes rise more abruptly to a rugged chain, marked by Mountains south, prominent peak of Shah Jehan, the south ern spurs of which fall into the Isfarain and Juvain plain. The extent of plateau land is difficult to estimate ; but it cannot be less t ^ ie norti ^ ern section of the mountainous portion of the district, which would give an area of about 250 square miles.KUC—KUC 447 The principal mountain peaks of the chief ship are—in the south, SMh Prominent peaks.

The soil is alluvial and fertile ; and silk, cotton, and rice are raised. But the staple product is grain, for which there are numerous and easily accessible markets. _ , 1A In the lower part of the plain, about 30 miles from Kuchan and 10 miles in % 1 from the defile known as the Tang-i-Raza-abad, . ShxrvSn. is tlie town 0 f Shir van—a thriving, clean, popu- lous little place, well protected, after the fashion of the country by walls and towers^ There are 10 to 12 villages within a circle of 5 miles of the town. The soil is fertile and better watered than that of the upper valley. The plateaux north of KOchan, which dram east into the Atrak and F west into the Darreh Gaz stream, have m all Villages of the plateau. about a dozen villages, some of them of con siderable size. They have an average elevation of 5,000 feet, and the soil is light and fertile, bearing good crops of gram, returning from ten to fifteen fold without irrigation. Save m spring, these highlands have a bleak, cheerless aspect, being destitute of trees and swept con stantly by high winds. , ,, . , The village stands out in wide, undulating stretches of arable land, un sheltered and unscreened by the usual circle of gardens and vineyards Tlie valleys descending from the plateaux and the elevated ndges of the mountains north of hueban have many fine Villages of the northern villages. They are well watered, have fertile soil valleys. an( i extensive groves and vineyards. The higher elevations are wooded with juniper and the ravines with barberry, wdd pomegranates and thorn brakes. In spring there is good pasturage. The principal villages of this tract are Sburaq and Lurb Adam, in a wild idea at the head of the Darreh Gaz stream, numbering, with hamlets, 150 houses of Turks and Kurds ; Gifan, to the south-west of the last, so iamed from a small stream which flows past SLirvan mto the Atrak : and the Kushkaneh and other large villages lying on a plateau just south of the crest of the Atak range, draining into the Atrak. The southern mountains have on their slopes many large villages with gardens and vineyards and large extents ot un- Villages of the southern brigated arable land. The limit of cultivation mountains. extends far up towards the crest of the range, and the slopes afford fine pasturage. The upper villages are inhabited chiefly bv Garili (a.v.) Turks ; the lower, in common with the villagers m the phm of Kuchan, by Za’afaranlu Kurds. The villages m this tract number from 20 to 30, exclusive of many small hamlets. It is known as the Buluk-i-Junubl (Southern sub-division). ' The mass of the population of Khchan are Za’afaranM Kurds who may be estimated at about four-fiivhs of the who e. Population. The balance includes Turks of the Garili tribe, a few families of the old Atak tribes, now known, from the names of the towns they inhabited, as Anauis, ’Isbqabadis, Minnais, and probably a so of Turk origin, and a sprinkling of ’Ajams or Persians.There are from 2,000 to 3,000 tents of nomads of the Za afaranlu and ’Airarlu tribes, moving for the most part about the skirts of the plain and in the southern mountains. The Za’afaianlu at the time of their first settlement had, according to their traditions, 24,000 families, or about 120,000 souls. If so, they must have decreased much in numbers ; for at the highest estimate they cannot have, now, more than half that number* Prom an average of the population of the villages passed through, And from careful local inquiry, the following computation, which is probab y near the truth, though possibly slightly excessive, was made .

The plain is an almost unbroken sheet of cultivation, and the villages cover a large extent of ground ; their size being, however, exaggerated by the fine gardens and groves surrounding them. The Za’afaranlu are a fine, robust race, the men of good stature and stout, with usually fair complexions as compared with Material condition. ^ p e0 pi e 0 f ot h er p ar ts. They appear invari* ably well fed and clothed, and their villages are neatly built, clean, and en* livened by troops of children of all ages-*—an unusual sight. They bear a high character for courage, and are always civil, hospitable, and honest in their dealings. Their independent, manly bearing marks them as superior to the inhabitants of the southern districts, and is also an evidence of their prosperous condition. Kuchan is beyond dispute the most productive tract in Khorasan ; it may, in fact, be termed the granary of the prov- Resources. sur pi us produce finds its way into Russian territory and the markets of Meshed and of all the towns of th6 eastern borders ; and it is in seasons when the crops of the southern dis tricts fail by reason of drought that its value is most felt. The drainage of two great chains of mountains gives it unequalled ad vantages of irrigation ; and large tracts of corn land lying at a considerable elevation, sheltered from the parching south winds, and within reach of the moisture-laden breezes from the Caspian and the fertile plains and valleys to the east of it, ensure a fair supply of grain, even when the annual rainfall is deficient. The following extract, translated from the Shah’s Diary in Khorasan, will show how fully the importance of this tract is ap preciated ; and it is also worthy of special note that nearly the whole of it lies north of the main branch of the Atiak :— “ The soil of that place (Kuchan) is the most productive of any in th e vicinity of Meshed. The corn land, which is both irrigated and unirrigated 48 I. B. 3 L450 KUC-KUC is in a favourable year the source of supply of everal of the towns of Khorasan ; and so dependent are they upon this supply, that any dis- curbance or accident of seasons occurring in Fuel an, likely to injure the crops, at once affects the prices current in all the towns of the province.” Save a small proportion of the town people and of the nomads, the whole population is engaged in the production of com. The amount of silk and cotton raised is small. The average annual outturn of grain of the district is estimated at Produce Of grain. 71,440 kharwars (566 280 Indian maunds). Of this about 30,440 kharndrs are required for the consumption of the people and the ba'ance 41,000 kharudrs (325.000 Indian maunds) is the surplus available for export. About 30,000 kharudrs of this are exported to Russian territory (Transcaspia) and the rest to Meshed and Sabzawar, etc. This surplus may appear to be a very large amount in proportion to the numbers of the population ; but it must be remem bered that agriculture, and especially the cultivation of wheat, is the only industry of the district, and that the unirrigated lands capable of bearing crops are of great extent, and return ten and fifteen fold for the labour cf ploughing to the depth of a few inches and sowing broadcast. On the plateau the same land is never sown two sea on. in succession, each field or hill slope being allowed a fallow of from one to two or three years. The store? of corn of the Kuchan villages would prove an invaluable resource to any fo*ce occupying Meshed. For even shouM the people be hostile, the country is so open and e sy that a force of cavalry might reach Kuchan in a few hours, without any fear of being entangled in mounta nous or difficult ground. Transport. . transport available for hire in the district is as follows :— Camels, about .. .. # 2 Mules and ponies, about .. .. j q^q Donkeys, about .. .. # _ j 200 The enrolled or paid forces of Kuchan consist, in the first place, of a body Irregular forces. horse, recruited among the Za’a^aianlu. vi m , They are mounted and aimed by the Chief and are thoroughly efficient for the work required of them. In fact, so good are o orses and men, that a little, better discipline and better arms on’y are required to make them thoroughly efficient light ho se, admirably fitted to perform what a-e the most important dukes of mounted infantry. In common with all the horsemen of this border, whethe Kurd or Turkoman, ey are unused to charge home, as cavalry in Europe are expected to do, with sword or lance. ^ Their weapon is the gun, wki h they use always if possible at speed, either when circling round, or retreating from their enemy. ® Lach horseman receives from 10 to 15 tumdns in cash and an assignment on a vi age for com to about the same value, making his pay up to about 10 rupees V er rmnsem. He lives also, save when at Kuchan, at freeNo horses are bred, the chief only having a few mares. He is entirely dependent for remounts on purchase. With an unlimited supply of men fit to ride, the chief would thus with the utmost efforts be unable to collect more than 15 000 horse. The Kushkaneh plateau, which has fine pastures, furnishes about a third of the Kuehan horse ; and a body of that number is usually stationed there to defend the weakest po nt of the border, and to be ready to raid without delay in any direction the chief may direct. At Shirvan there are also 30 to 40 shamkldlchis, (mounted match 1 ockmen). The adult male peasants of the district must number not less than from 15,000 to 20,000; and a large proporticn are armed. The border villagers are inured to war, and are fair marksmen. In their own mountains they would prove form dable adversaries. The chief, or as he is sometimes styled the llklidni of the Za afaranlu, holds his country on somewhat the same terms as the Tenure o c i fb ips. Illehani of Bujnurd. He is bound to give military service when required, and to guard his border and the district &gt; in his rear ; but, in consideration o c the superior productiveness of his country, he is r quired to pay a large sum yearly in the shape of revenue. This sum has been gradually increased until it now reaches 40,000 tumdns in cash and 8,930 kharwd s of grain, (§ wheat and i barley), and 1,345 kharwars of chopped straw per annur • T n addition to this, a yearly tribute in hors s and go d co n is exacted. These terms are easy when the wealth of the distric' is considered ; and the complete exemption of the people from regu lar mili' a y service is, ; t he price, a cheap boon. In addition 1o the protection of his own border* on which the security of the district r in the rear depends, the chief is bound to aid the llkhdni of Bujnurd ; but such rs istance is seldom required, and the feud between these two tribes makes any cordial co-operation impossible. The Chief of Darreht Gaz also has the right to demand assitance, if necessary. Rira Qulr Khan succeeded Amir Guna Khan as the 3rd chief. He maintained himse f for some time in rebellion against the authority of FatK ’Ali Shah. R za Qulr Khan was succeeded by Sam Khan, who was the 4th chief and the firs f of the family to get the title of Shuja’-ud-Dauleh. Sam Khan died about the year 1805 A.D. On his death his son Khan Bah a Khan was a minor. He was appoint ed Governor with his unc 1 e Amir Husain Khan as Deputy Governor. The latter, however, soon got all the power into his own hands, and eventually was recognized as the 5th chief and given the title of Shuja’-ud-Dau 1 eh. Amir Husain Khan was in his time the most influential chief in Khora- ean. He bore a high character for personal courage. He was, however^ ambitious, proud and extravagant; qualities which secured respect, while they interfered with his popularity. With his ambition he did not com bine any of the talents that would have made it dangerous, but was, on the con'rary, shallow and imprudent. He was popularly believed to be aim ing at the chief post in the province ; and with his wealth, influence and a great assumption of piety, which secured him the go r d will of the priest- hood, the pr'ce was hardly beyond his reach, if his pride had not brought him in 1881 into collision with the then Governor General, a mishap that 3L2452 KUC-KUC ■ “w caused his temporary banishment and disgrace. In the winter of 1873 he refused to attend a summons of the Governor General to reply to some r. charges brought against him. A force was taken by the Governor General in person, as far as Sarkan, a village a short distance from Kuchan. The Kurds held by their chief and prepared to resist the royal troops, and open w ' war was only averted by concessions on both sides. The season was very unfavourable and the attitude of the Za’afaranlus determined, while the k Kuchan chief knew well that the ultimate result of resistance could only be most disastrous to himself. He was allowed to remain in his chiefship, but on payment of a heavy bribe, under the name of a fine, to his superior ; and the troops returned to Meshed. He had, however, to deal with an implacable and powerful enemy and was afterwards forced to present himself, first at Meshed and then at Tehran, and suffered imprisonment and confiscation of all his property, while his eldest son ’Abdul Hasan Khan was driven into open rebellion. Amir Husain Khan was eventually reinstated and enjoyed peace forth© r latter 12 years of his life. He had a bad fall from his horse while accom panying the Persian Boundary Commissioner to Firuzeh, and succumbed to the injuries he had received. , On his death the present Chief, Muhammad Nasir Khan, succeeded to the Governorship and the title of Shuja’-ud-Dauleh. He was dismissed by the Shah at the end of 1894, and his cousin Khan Baba Khan, son of Sam [ Khan, the 4th chief, was granted the title of Muzaffar-us-Saltaneh and appointed Chief of the Za’afaranlu tribe and Governor of Kuchan in his place, with Sartip Ramzan Khan, the most favourite servant of Amir Husain , Khan, as Deputy Governor. The intrigues caused by this change, however, fed to the murder of Ramzan Khan, the removal of Khan Baba Khan and the reinstatement of Muhammad Nasir Khan, about the middle of 1895. Idle present Chief of Kuchan (1898), Muhammad Nasir Khan, Shuja’- I ud-Dauleh, is a man of 34 years of age, (in 189&amp;) and one of the most pro minent chieftains in Khorasan. He is, however, proud, and extravagant in'his personal expenditure. Among the Za’afaranlu, the chief is unpopular. His pride and the exactions necessary to maintain his lavish expenditure ,■ are alleged to be the chief causes. Muhammad Nasir Khan, Shuja’-ud-Dauleh, has no sons, only two daughters, and it is said that owing to opium, charas, drink, etc., he is not likely now to have a son. His elder brother Abdul Hasan Khan, who died of cholera at Tehran in 1892, has left a son, named Abdul Riza Khan, now about 18 years of age. The Chief is on friendly terms with the Russians, receiving presents from them. His father supplied the Russian troops in 1880-81 with pro visions, and, like the other border chiefs, he respected and was grateful to the power that had relieved him from the Turkoman raids.— (Napier ; Mac Gregor \ O’’Donovan-, C.

A town in northern Khorasan, containing some 2,000 houses, inhabited by Za afaranlil Kurds, Turks, and Persians. Napier estimates the popula- lisWiHi at 9,000. The town was in a ruinous condition in 1875, from til9effects of frequent earthquakes which prevail in this district. All the houses were of mud, and nearly all flat-roofed ; though a new kind of building is said to be built. It consists of a tent roof with no walls, erected of poles tied to each other and to a ridge pole, the ends buried in the earth, and the whole covered with a layer of earth. There is a poor bazar ; with scarcely anything in it, beyond the ordinary country produce ; but a good number of copper pots and woollen stockings are made and exported via Rasht : sheepskin pelisses are also manufactured. Outside the town for more than a mile round is one vast vineyard, and an excellent wine is produced. Beyond this radius, there is a large extent of wheat cultivation. In the north-east of the town is a hill rising about 150 feet at a distance of 2,500 or 3,000 yards, which is called Nadir-i -Tappeh and completely commands the town at this range. The town is fo;tiffed in the usual manner, and must have been a strong place at one time ; the ditch being about 35 feet deep and 30 feet broad, and the line of fortification extending about a mile and a half in circumference. The walls, however, in many places were knocked down by the earthquake of 1872, and have not since been repaired. A fine stream flows past the north side of the town, irrigating the lands. on either bank as far as Shlrvan, and eventually falling into the Atrak. Kuchan is noted for its fruits, as well as its grapes.—(Rarwes ; Na'pier ; MacGregor.) Kuchan has got two gates, Darvazeh-i-Meshed and Darvazeh-i-Bujnurd. The mound with the ruined citadel stands in the middle of the town, and the rums are inhabited by gipsies and called Mahalkh-i-Karishmal (gipsies). The town has 8 mahallehs : Mahalleh-i-Sandalsuz, Baba Khanjar, Kara Ulang, Pa-i-Kharas, Pa-i-Chinar, Sarban Mahalleh, Pa-i-Bagh, Mahalleh-i-ShahvardI Khan ; 8 mosques, and 10 public baths. A great space in the southern part of the town, about one quarter of the area within the town wall, is covered with fields ; this was the part of the town destroyed by the crown- prince ’Abbas Mirza when he besieged the town about 65 years ago. It is now called Kurd Mahalleh.—(ScAmRer.) Kuchan was again visited by a severe earthquake in 1894, which des troyed most of the town.— (F. McSwiney.) The shops are all being constructed of wooden posts, with the interstices only filled up with mud and plastered over. The posts are all jointed and tied together to make the building as firm and yet as light as possible, with a view to future earthquakes ; the great pity is that when rebuilding the shops, the Shuja’-ud-Dauleh did not take the opportunity to make the people widen the street, but, as it is, everybody is rebuilding on the site of his former house, or wherever he likes, without any reference to order or regularity. Owing to the press of work wages are said to be abnormally high, carpenters and masons getting as much as 8 and 10 Jcrdns a day. The population, which is now said to have decreased to 20,000, are still mostly housed in the wigwams and shanties run up by them with old timber after the earthquake, and no attempt has been made at rebuilding the town in general. The place is quite free, however, from all smell. Kuchan appears to have no particular industry ; coarse silk cloth for coats and bed-wrappers, and woollen and silk socks are the only manufactures. The population of the town is rated much too high, I think, by the Shuja’-ud-Dauleh and his Bounty Governor. The latter numbered it at454 KUC-KUH 20.000, but I should be inclined to say that 20,000 was probably the population before the earthquake and that now it has decreased to about 10.000. I do not t; iak h e are now more than 2,000 families in the place. The village of Khabusiian lies lower down—a couple of miles below the gorge—and is said to be the site of the old Kuchan. Possibly it may have been destroyed by an earthquake in its day and deserted for the present Ku;hai, just as the latter was destroyed in 1893, and was so nearly deserted for a fresh site still farther east in 1894.— (C. E. Yate, 1894.) At the beginning of 1895 another earthquake, in which about 700 lives were lost, completely destroyed the old town of Kfichan and turned it into a mass of ruins, whereupon it was decided to abandon the site altogether and to build p new town ne r Hsihai, a village about 7| miles east of the old town. (For information regarding the new town, see Naslria.) Though the majority of the population have removed to the new town, a number of people who own vineyards and gardens at old Kuchan have rema ned there to look after them. Therefore old Kuchan may now be describ* ed as a village containing about 200 wooden huts.— Bakhsh.) KUCHAN (No. 3) or GARMA KHAN— (River). A stream in Kh&lt; rasan, which rises in the mountains north of the town of old Kuchan, and flows west to the Kuchan plain past Shirvan, and thence passes into a narrow defile, enclosed by high mountains, known as the Gar- ma Khan, in which it flows till it reaches the Gurgan plain. It is crossed at a few miles from Shirvan by the road thence to Bujnurd ; it flows then in a deep bed, with steep, gravelly banks, passable at all times, both banks being about equal in height and the approaches level. This stream is, in fact, the main tributary of the Atrak in its early course. This is the same as the Tafca ik.— {Napier.) KUGl {MacGregor) or K AHUGISH {Gill)— Lax. 34° 59' 0' ; Long. 57° 38' O'; Elev. 2,940'.— {Stewart.) A stage in Khorasan on the. road from Tabas to Sabzawar, and 114 miles from the former town. There is good water here in a well, 12 feet deep, but no habitation or supplies. The spot can be recognised by a detached hill about J mile west of the road. The well of Kahugish lies on the north-east side of this hill. Some graves lying between the hill and the road may also serve to identify the spot.— {MacGregor ; Gill.) KtJH-I-B AJ VIRD— A range of hills shutting ir the Turshiz plain to the noith.—{Stewart.) KUH-I- AH ANGAR AN- A range of mountains in southern Khorasan, which is known farther on as Khwaja Shahz. At the foot of the range, about 13 miles fromChah- rakhts (Shahrakht), stands the small village of Ahangaran, shortly after passing which a pass in the mountains is entered.— {Stewart.)

KtH-I-AK MESHED— A high mountain in the main range of northern Khorasan, extending from the Shaughan plain in the west to beyond Zu Iram in the east. Its principal western spur is the Kuh-i-Saluq {q.v.), its eastern spurs are the Kuh-i-Takht-i-Mirza and Kuh-i-KazI. Oi e of the western spurs is crossed by the Siah Khaneh pass, south of Bujnurd. The highest peak of this range has an elevation of about 10,000 feet.— (Schindler.)

A mountain range in northern Khorasan, about 10 miles from Askh- abad in the Atak, and passed by the road thence to Darreh Gaz a short dis tance to the east. This range is, in reality, part of the Atak chain, and is only locally known by this name, which in reality belongs to a single mountain west of the Darreh Gaz plain, far up on the north side of the Darreh Gaz stream. It forms the northern boundary L of the Darreh Gaz dis trict.— (Napier.) KtfH-I-ASFtZEH- A mountain in Khoiasan on a range to the north of Kuchan, bearing from that place 330°.— (MacGregor.) u KtH-I-ATAK— A border range, between northern Khorasan and the Turkoman coun try.

A town in Kirman, 93 miles north-north-west of the city of that name with which it is connected by a road running via Zarand. Situated in a fertile valley, some 6 miles long by 2 broad, Kuh Banan is the^ centre of a group of villages, and possesses about 1,000 houses with 4,000 inhabitants. On a spur above the town are the remains of an old fort, and a little lower, about a mile from the town, stands a platform of hewn stone, with two low towers above it, called the throne of Latif Shah The latter was a Governor of the district who was slain by the Afghan* under Ashraf and Muhammad when they sacked the district. From its position near the frontier of Kirman, Kuh Banan was in early times a place of some importance, and was frequently seized and held as the ruler of Yazd. Marco Polo describes it, under the name of Cobinan bv a large town, possessing much iron and steel and ondanique, “ where they make steel mirrors of great size and beauty, and also prepare ‘ Tutia ’ (a thing very good for the eyes).” The only industry of anv importance now carried on is carpet-making, but the patterns produced here are inferior to those of Kirman, having too much white. The water is good, and supplies are procurable in large quantities while there is excellent camel grazing in the neighbourhood. The revenue in 1902 was 600 tumans—(Stack ; Sykes, 1902 ; Wyatt, 1899.) KUH BANAN (2)- A plain or plateau east-south-east of Yazd, and north-west of Kirman on the boundary between them. It has an area of perhaps a dozensquare miles backed by a semi-circle of hills, and green with orchards and fields and extensively interspersed with white patches of salt. Five villaffes stand in the plain, Kuh Banan itself being the chief; they are wTltered and cultivate more poppy than wheat.—1882.) KUH-I-BIGtT— A range of hills bounding the Turshiz plain on the south.— KUH-I-BIHUD— The western continuation of the Kuh-i-Baras Khorasan.— (Bellew.) KUH-I-BINALUD— in the Kain district of be jT- en Meshed and Ni ^apur, extending f om Shanfabad in the south to Sultan Maidan in the north. Nearly every °^ tS P® aks or hl g h e r ran ges has a separate name, being generally called after the village wkch lies nearest to it. For instance, the high hills north and north-east of Nishapur (fiBW to 10,000 feet) are called Kuh-i-Mihra- nur’- tWtn f00t ’ ab ° Ut 6 miIes north of Msh ^- pur those to the east of Mihrabad are the Kuh-i-Kharv (10,000—11000 feet), Bellew s Kavar range, from the village Kharv (generally pronounced tW^d'l WV18 n n0Un - C i! d '^ aur )’ near Darrud, and the ranges north of « d Q adam g ab and Shanfabad bear the names Kuh-i-Langar nd Kuh-i-Bivazhan, from the village Langar and the sub-district and villageKUH—KUH 457 Bivazhan. The hills north-west of Nistapur and enclosing the Bar district are known by the name of the Kuh-i-Bar 5 some of their higher peaks are the Kuh-i-Sarbi (10,400 feet), Zargaran, Ushturub, Tahiri, Alkhas, Na’ldagh (8,7-00 feet), Kuruna (7,800 feet). North-east of Bar are the Kuzahi hills, so called from their enclosing a plateau which is always full of snow and supplies many springs (kuza f a waterpot), and at the north-western extremity of the range are the Kuh-i-Dalba and Kuh-i-Haidari hills. The whole range is also sometimes called Kuh-i-Mshapur, particularly by the people of the Chinaran plain, who again distinguish the hills of Akhlamand, Firizi, etc., after villages on the eastern slopes. The drainage from the Binalud range supports a great part of the Meshed district, almost the whole of the Nishapur district and, through the Sultan Maidan river, a part of Isfaiain. The range is separated from the Isfaraln hills by the Mamsh and Sultan Maidan plains, and is also distinct from the hills with the turquoise mines. It consists principally of sandstones and nummulitic limestones lying on clay slates and gneiss, often broken through by immense masses of volcanic rock, which form high peaks. The mineral riches of tlm range are not very great ; near Turuqbeh there is an old gold mine (auriferous quartz in gneiss) ; near Sbandfz there are marble quarries; near Firizi coal has been found in sandstone ; near Bar there are old mines of lead and copper, and traces of turquoise have been found in the Mihrabad hills north of Nishapur. Only one road leads over this range, viz., the road from Meshed to Nisha pur, via Turuqbeh, Jagharq andDarrud (Darrud pass, alt. 9,003 feet), and that is closed by snow in winter. The usual road from Meshed to Nishapur, is via Sharifabad. Communication between the villages east and west of the range is kept up (in summer only) by very difficult and sometimes dangerous footpaths.— (Schindler.) KUH-I-BINAR— A magnificent scarped hill in Astarabad, seen to the left of the hutal Chilchilian on the road from Shahrud to Shahkuh.— (MacGregor.) KUH-I-BIZ A— A range of low hills in Khorasan some miles north of Mazinan. So called from the village Biza (g.v.) which lies in one of its valleys.— (Schindler.) , KUH-I-BIZAK— A range of hills 40 mil s from the Perso-Afghan border, west of Turbat- i-Shaikh Jam, the culminating peak of which rises behind Shahr-i-Nau, the princip 1 village of the Bakharz district. It has snow on its sides far into the summer. From Kuh-i-Bizak the range falls away eastward, passing behind Taiabad and Kafir Kaleh to the banks of the Hari Bud.— (Na / pier. x , KUB-I-BUHAR or KUH-I-BEH AR— Lat. 37° 10' 0°; Long. 56° 40' 0' Elev. 8,000'.— (Napier.) A range of hills in Kurdish Khorasan, a few miles to the west of Sankhas (Sang-i-Khvast). The highest summit attains a height of 8,000 feet above the sea. MacGregor says it is a spur of the Shahkhh range. The Buhar458 KUH—KUE ridge lias the same geological formation as the Jaghatai mountains on the south side of the plain. Trap rock predominates, and the dark rich soil afforded by these supports a more than ordinarily luxuriant vegetation. The daim, or unirrigated wheat crops, on the mountain slopes are particu larly good, the yield being ten to fifteen-fold more than in other paits. Copper and lead are said to have been found inBuhar but never worked ; of the presence of the former there are numerous indications.— {Napier.)

KtTH-I-CHEHILSANG— A range of mountains in north-eastern Khorasan, which runs parallel with the Kuh-i-Kiighar, and divides the drainage of the Jam district from that of the Meshed river. It is also called “ Kuh-i-Yughar ” (q.v.) and seems identical with the range called by Napier “ Kuh-i-Qad-i-Sham- shir.”— {MacGregor.) See Kuh-i-Kughar.— {C. E. Yate.) KUH-I-CHIQAB or CHAQAB— A border mountain in northern Khorasan, between which and the Kuh- i-Buhar is the easiest and most used Turkoman pass, leading from the Robat- i-’Ishq (or Ishq) in the Shaugban valley. The pass has a spring of water, which enables the raiders to make the distance to the Alhaq spring on the high road of Khoiasan, over 40 miles, in one stretch. The Kuh-i-Chiqab is steep and rugged, and rises to 2,000 or 3,000 feet in height above the plain.— {Napier.) KUH-I-CHIQAR—Lat. 37° 5' 6 '; L©ng. 56° 36' 0'.

The crest of this range is said to abound in fine pastures, with plenty of water. {MacGregor ; Napier.) A conical hill rises out of the main ridge on the east side but, with this exception, it is merely a more elevated ridge, than the surrounding moun tains, sloping gently to the east, but precipitous on the western sides. On the highest point of the crest, 9,600 feet about sea-level, are cairns built by pilgrims. An extensive view from the summit, ranging from the Meshed Valley on the south, across Lain and Darreh Gaz to Trans-Caspia on the north. On a clear day Askhabad is visible, 50 or 60 mules distant.

The highest peak in the Kuh-i-Jaghatai-Juvain is the Kuh-i-Zar, which is 5,000 or 6,000 feet. It is formed for the most part of trap rocks overlying marls and clays. In its glens are many springs, which water a succession of small hamlets, with extensive gardens, vineyards, and groves of mulberry, raised for silk cultivation. The soil of the glen and slopes, of disintegrated trap and rich marls, is most fertile.— {MacGregor, Napier.) KUH-I-JEHAN ARKIAN— . r ^ ie Ba m -Safiabad district is separated from the Kuchan district (accord ing to the Shah s diary of 1867, page 314) by the Kuh-i-Jehan Arklan, the northern slopes of which are said to be occupied by the Za’afaranlu Kurds and the southern slopes by the Bughiri Turks. * The Kuh-i-Jehan Ar- kiarnsa lofty mountain standing out to the north by west of Bam. Itis locally called Kuh-i-Shali Jehan, and this seems to be the general name. Arkian was an ancient town some 3 or 4 miles north-west of Bam, and the site of it is now occupied by a village called Jeban, hence the name Jehan Arkian cpioted by the Shah 5 s diarist, a name which appears to be sometimes applied to the whole Bam district. The Sani’-ud-Dauleh in his Matla-ush- Shams gives the following explanation regarding the name of the mountain “ it is said that on the top of Kuh-i-Shah Jehan are two mausoleums called Shah Jehan and Jehan Arkian. Therefore, the skirts on this side (to the south of the road to Meshed) are called Shah Jehan, and those on the other side Jehan Arkian, as the tomb of Shah Jehan inclines towards this (i.e. the road) side, and the tomb of Jehan Arkian on that _side.” The Shah Jehan range is said to be quite distinct from the Aleh Dagh.— (Ct E. Yate.) KUH-I-JAMI— A range of hills in Khorasan, some 30 miles above Tuman Aqa. The Hari Rud is said to make its way through them at the Tang-i-Daria.

It con tains four tanks, all of which are cut from the rock and the largest of which, 50 feet square by 20 feet deep, is lined throughout with brick. On other peaks below are the remains of buildings.— (Sykes, 1905.) KUH-I-SANG-I-DUKHTAR— A range of hills in Khorasan to the north-west of Ghurian, said to be a spur of the range crossed between Ghurian and Khaf. Napier says the name only applies to an isolated bill south of the above spur.— (MacGregor \ Napier )492 MAD-MAD eiders that the great fall in the price of turquoises in Europe is mainly due to the quantity of stones of these and of the Sar-i-Ra’ish mines, which have been sent to Europe and kept moist in damp earthenware pots till they were sold. Out of the damp they lost their colour, and in a year or two thus became quite faded. European jewellers in consequence have at present no confidence in these turquoises, and buy at very low prices. The next and last, and also most westerly valley is the one with the Kamari mine. This mine is full of water at present, and several attempts made to empty it have failed. It has some thick veins of turquoises; but the stones are of no use for rings, being usually worked into armlets, seals, etc. A little to the south of the ’All Mirzai mine lies the Khujuri mine— very extensive, but partly filled up. It had sixty years ago very good tur quoises, but at present it is not worked. There are many more mines with names, perhaps a hundred, and more than a hundred nameless ones ; but they are either parts of those already enumerated or unimportant. Work in these mines is carried on with picks and crowbars, and gunpowder. Blasting with gunpowder has come into vogue only within the last twenty years. Formerly all the work was done by picks, and much better. The picks extracted the turquoises entire. The gunpowder does more work but breaks the stones into small pieces. (6) The ‘ ‘ khdlcl ’ ’ mines. —These are diggings in the detritus and rubbish collected at the foot of the above-mentioned mines, and the alluvial soil, consisting of the detritus of rocks, and extending from the foot of the mountain a mile or so into the plain.* The finest turquoises are at present found in the khaki mines. In fact, good ring stones are at present only obtainable from the khaki mines. Work here is carried on by promis cuous diggings, without any system whatever. The earth is brought to the surface,—sifted, and searched for turquoises ; the latter work being generally done by the children. A fine turquoise, valued at Rs. 2,000, was found in the khaki mines, and presented to the Shah. (2) The salt mine is situated about 6 miles east ol the Ma’dan village, near the little hamlet of Kara Quchi. The salt consists of an immense bed of rock salt enclosed by gypsum and nummulitic limestone. The salt is verv white and clear ; in many parts quite as transparent as glass. (3) The lead mine lies about 6 miles south of the village of Ma’dan in the Batau mountain. The lead occurs in irregular veins, striking N. 40° E., S. 40° W., in the slates underlying the limestones. The mine is not an important one and has not been worked for many years ; in fact, not since the accession of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. As soon as the news of Muhammad Shah s decease reached Khorasan the ’Amarlu Kurds revolted and took possession of the turquoise mines. The inhabitants of the Ma’dan village fled to the Batau mountain, and worked the lead mine for a few months, till order was restored and the Kurds left the turquoise mines. The mine has since then been neglected. (4) The millstone quarry lies about 4 miles south of the Ma’dan village, on the northern slope of the Batau mountain. The stones are cut out of a rough sandstone, lying under the sandstone of the nummulitic formation. * Any one who wants to work in the IchcUci mines on his own account has to pay the farmers 1 krdn a day for the privilege.— [Thomson.) ~ *About 20 or 30 pairs of stones are obtained annually, and sold at about 6 tumdns a pair. The Persian Government, up to the 21st March 1882, has received, on account of these four mines, the sum of 8,000 tumdns per annum. Either the inhabitants of the Ma’dan village paid this sum themselves, and worked the mines at their own risk, or some person farmed the mines from the Government for the same sum,—retained one or two mines for his own exclusive benefit, worked one or two others in partnership with some of the villages, and sub-let the remainder for 5,000 or 6,000 tumdns per annum to the villagers. The villagers generally paid whatever was agreed upon in turquoises ; and they could sell the turquoises they obtained when and how they liked. The money they had to pay was divided, at the rate of 60 tumdns a head, among the ra’dyats —some rd’dyats according to their means, number of children, etc., paying a whole head ; others seven-eighths, three- fourths, etc., to one-quarter of a head, or 15 tumdns a year. The Jcadkhu- dds,* of whom there were five, paid nothing, and fixed the amount each ra'dyat was to pay. Some Saiyxds, two or three mullds, the barbers, and some of the relatives and friends of the kadkhudds, were also exempted. The barbers of this district possess firmans of the Safavian monarchs exempting them from taxes in perpetuity. The salt mine was given to the Saiyids of the village, in lieu of 250 tumdns pension, during Karim Khan’s reign. The Saiyids lately sold their right to the salt mine for about 2,000 tumdns to some of the villagers, who since then call the mine their private property. In the Government accounts, however, the mine still figures as Crown property at a yearly rent of 250 tumdns, and this sum is included in the 8,000 tumdns which the Government receives from the turquoise mine and its villages. From the 21st March 1882, His Majesty the Shah gave the turquoise mines of the Ma’dan district to the Mukhbir-ud-Dauleh for a period of 15 years, the latter paying 9,000 tumdns for the first year and 18,000 tumdns for the remaining 14 years. The turquoises at the mine are first divided into three classes :— (1) Angushtdrl. (2) Bdrkhdneh. (3) 'Arabi. (1) All turquoises of good and fast colour and favourable shape are classed with the ‘ angushtdri ’ stones (ring stones). They are sold by the piece. It is impossible to fix any price, or classify them according to different qualities. A stone two-thirds of an inch in length, two-fifths of an inch in width, and about \ inch thick, cut * paikdni ’ shape, was valued at Meshed at £300. Another of the same prize, shape and cut was only valued at £80. Turquoises the size of a pea are sometimes sold for £8. The colour most prized is deep sky-blue. A small speck of a lighter colour, which only connoisseurs can distinguish, or an almost imperceptible tinge of green, decreases the value considerably. Then there is that indefinable property of a good turquoise, the i zat,' &gt; something like the water of a diamond or the lustre of a pearl. A fine-coloured turquoise without the '‘zat ’ is not worth much. A deep colour, almost an indigo-like blue, is called ‘ talkh ’ (bitter) * Headmen.494 MAD—MAD and decreases the value of the stone. The best angushtdrl stones are found in the khaki diggings and in the Abd-ur-Razaq mine. (2) The hdrkhdneh stones are generally divided into four qualities and sold by weight. The first quality costs at the mines between 1,500 and 1,600 tumdns per Tabriz man, equal to about £90 per lb. The fourth quality is worth 70 to 80 tumdns per man. Only the first and part of the second quality are sent to Europe ; the others are sold in the country to Persian jewellers and goldsmiths, particularly at Meshed, and are employ ed for encrusting Persian articles of jewellery, armlets, daggers, sword- hilts and sheaths, horse trappings, etc. At Meshed small, cut turquoises of the third quality can be bought at the rate of from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 per iOO. Many of the hdrkhdneh stones sent to Europe are employed by European jewellers for rings ; but the mere fact of the miners themselves not classing them with the angushtdrl stones proves them to be of an inferior quality. (3) ’Arabi turquoises. —All stones not belonging to the first two kinds are called 'arabi. Their name is of recent origin, and was first adopt-d at the mines for bad, and in Persia, unsaleable, stones. Some of the miners, when on a pilgrimage to Mecca, had taken with them a quantity of bad turquoises, and sold them well to the Arabs. Since then any pale-gre n or spotted turquoise is called 'arabi. The whitish turquoises of this k nd are called i shirbumi * or 'shirfam ’ and round pieces with a whie crest are called chaghaleh. Many of the so-calltd 'arabi turquoise, are,, however, bought by the Persians, and many go to Europe. The large flat pieces and slabs used for armlets, brooches, etc., at the mines called ‘ tufal, are now classed with the arabi stones, although some of them are very much esteemed ; pieces of 2 inches in length, 1 inch in width, and k inch in thickness being sometimes valued at 10 tumdns. Stones of a greenish colour, called gul-i-kasni (chickory), aie bought principally by Afghans. 12 lb in weight of pale-coloured ‘ tufal ’ stones are sold at the mines sometimes for as much as 180 tumdns. About 200 men of the Ma dan village work in the mines and n the khaki digging 8 * an d 25 or 30, the Rish Safids (the elders of the village) by the turquoises and sell them to the merchants and jewellers, either at Meshed or at the mines. The original finders of the turquoise do not gain much. A man who works in the mines gains on an average about 5 krdns (2s.) per diem in turquoises. Work in the mines is difficult, but sur \ A miner never returns empty-handed. In the diggings the work s comparatively easy : bnt a man is never sure of finding a turquoise. It oft n happens that a miner after working hard for a few months in the mines, and having saved a few tumdns, tries his chance at the diggings and works there ; find ing nothing until his money is finished, he sells and paw .s his goods and chattels; still finds nothing, and finally, to keep starvation out of his doors, has to return to the mines. Good workmen never go to the khaki diggings, but send their children there. (P the 200 miners in the village, quite lo0 work in the mines. Tne old and weak, or those who possess a little property and are in no eeitain want of daily grain, and the lazy, work in the khaki During the summer many strangers come to the mines and try their chance in the diggings. The Rish Safids generally buy their tur quoises direct from the workmen, and then sell them to the merchantsat Meshed, or to *dallals ’ (commission agents), who visit the mines. The first profit on all turquoises is never less that TO per cent., and generally amounts to about 20 per cent. It is calculated that turquoises bought for 10 tumans at the mines sell for 25 tinmans in Europe. The miners themselves rarely cut their turquoises,* and they, therefore, seldom know if they have found good stones or not. The Risk Safid, who first buys the stones, often half-cuts them, and is then able to sort them. The angushtdrl stones are put aside and sold singly, and enormous profits are made. The annual outturn of the mines, mountains, and diggings averaged for the last few years 25,000 turndns’’ worth of turquoises valued at the mines. The final purchasers probably pay three times this amount. The turquoises are now cut generally by wheels made of a composition of emery and gum. The emery is brought from Badakhshan ; the gum from India. The cutter drives his wheel with his right hand by means of a stick and piece of string, which latter is twisted round the axle of the wheel. He holds the stone with his left hand against the wheel, the thumb and finger holding the stone being protected by rags, leather, or flat pieces of wood. Wheels have not been long in use—perhaps only 30 years ; formerly nearly all turquoises were cut on slabs of sandstone. The turquoise was held on a slit in a piece of wood, and was rapidly rubbed up and down the slab. Even now many stones are cut in this manner. Very small stones are never cut on the wheel, but always on the slab. After the turquoises have been cut, they are polished by being rubbed— first, on a slab of very fine sandstone ( * maskdl ’), and then on a piece of soft leather with turquoise dust that has been collected from the wheels. The polishing process is called * jila dadan.’ The pay of a turquoise-cutter, either at the mines or at Meshed, is one or 2 krdns per diem, the cutter providing wheel and other necessaries. A cutter on stone never receives more than 1 krdn per diem. The final polishing is generally done by children, who receive from ^ to J krdn per diem. One man can cut a handful of turquoises a day. One polisher does for three cutters. Turquoises are cut in various shapes. The shape depends on the size and original shape of the stone, as well as on its quality. The two principal shapes are the ‘paikdni ’ and the ‘ musattah,* that is, the conical and the flat. The less the oone is truncated, the more the turquoise is prized ; and again, a conical turquoise with an elliptical, is worth more than one with a circular, base. Turquoises not having suffi cient thickness for the paikdnl cut, and being thicker than necessary for the flat cut, are cut en cabochon ; and the higher the convex surface, the greater the value of the stone. Only very fine and deep-coloured turquoises are cut in the paikdni shape : the apex of a bad and pale-coloured turquoise if cut paikdni shape, would appear almost white. The slabs of the 'arabi quality are generally cut plain, without any convex surface. Smaller stone are used for seals; the larger sort for armlets, etc. The larger stones are seldom free from flaws, and seldom have a good colour, but the jewellers ,* No stones are out at the mines now, but all in Meshed.— [Thomson.)496 MAD—MAD very cleverly hide the flaws with a scroll of gold work, or cover them with characters engraved upon them. The salt mine of Ma’dan, by supplying all the country as far as Kuchan and Askhabad, has thus the greatest sale of salt of all this north-eastern part of Khorasan. It sells at a low estimate—15,000 loads of 150 to 180 pounds each per annum, or a total quantity of about 1,100 tons. The salt is sold at the mines at the rate of about 1 krdn per donkey load of 150 to 180 lb., which is about 13 krdns or 5s. 2d. per ton. The expenditure in obtaining this amount hardly amounts to £ 120 per annum. The salt mine, therefore, worked by the people who held it at a rent of 250 tumdns per annum, yielded an enormous profit to them. The rent was, therefore, increased to 600 tumdns in 1882, and to 1,000 tumdns in 1883. Schindler gives his report on the work at the mines during 1882-83 as follows :— “ j have mentioned that the Mukhbir-ud-Dauleh obtained from His Majesty the Shah the concession of the turquoise mines for 15 years, to begin from the 21st March 1882. The Shah was to receive 9,000 tumdns for the first year and 18,000 tumdns for each of the remaining H years. The Mukhbir-ud-Dauleh took into partnership Amin-ud-Danleh, Nasir-ud-Dauleh, and two Tehran merchants, HajI ’Ali NajI and Abdul BakI, and agreed to about f of the responsibilities, the other J being divided among the other four partners. I was sent to the mines in April 1882, as director of mines and governor of Ma’dan. I had orders to work all mines, mountains, and khaki, and monopolize the whole turquoise trade for the company, by sending all turquoises to Tehran. I arrived at ^ae mines in May, and had, after a fortnight, organized an administration, arranged the proper working of the mines, and abolished the promiscuous sale and purchase of the turquoises by the ra'dyats. As I worked all mines for the benefit of the company, the rd’dyats could not be in justice expected to pay any tax on the mines, and I reduced the 8,000 tumdns to 500, which I calculated on their sheep, cattle, fields, etc. The ra'dyats were very much satisfied with this arrangement ; but difficulties soon arose. The partners, instead of letting me do as I considered best, and as really was best for them, interfered continually. Every day I received different orders. The Risk Saflds, who under the new regime found themselves deprived of the gains they formerly had, when they could buy turquoises at the mines and sell them at Meshed, intrigued. The partners of the company neglected to supply me with money ; and once, when I had kept the villagers for seven weeks without their money, there was a strike. The villagers revolted, etc. In spite of these difficulties, I worked the mines—if not at a profit, certainly not at a loss—and left them in May 1883.” i The partners then arranged to take again, as tax from the villager^, 8,000 tumdns instead of 500 as before, work a few mines themselves, and let the others separately to some of the Rlsh Safids and villagers. They also continued to monopolize the turquoise trade, and prohibit the selling of the turquoises by the ra’dyats to any but their own agents. They have discontinued the despatch of all turquoises to Tehran, as well as the cutting of them there. They now keep only the good turquoises, andMAD—MAD 497 sell the inferior qualities at Meshed. These mines may with good arrange- ments be worked without a loss ; but the profit is, as can be seen from the accompanying table, very small :— , j Income.

Brie] Summary of past history and present working of the turquoise mines y November 1897. The following account compiled by Khan Bahadur Maula Bakhsh, gives particulars regarding the past history and present working of the mines :— “ According to the Sani’-ud-Dauleh, the turquoise mines are not mention ed in ancient history, and the oldest account of them appears in the Tan- suknameh-i-Ilkhani by Khwaja Nasir-ud-Din Tusi, written during the reign of Hulaku Khan (1253-64 A.D.). Up to the end of the reign of the Safavian dynasty the mines are said to have been worked by the Persian .-Government. During the anarchy which ensued and existed in Persia between that period and Muhammad Shah’s time they passed from one hand to the other, and were worked by such local chiefs or tribes as could take possession of and retain them by force of arms from time to time. Towards the end of Muhammad Shah’s time they are said to have been let by the Persian Government to the miners living in the two villages near the mines for only 500 tumdns a year, but the rent gradually rose to 3,000 tumdns per annum. In the year 1879 Haji Abul Kasim Khan Isfahan!, the Malik-ut-Tujjar of Meshed, increased the rent to 8,000 tumdns and worked the mines with great profit for three years. * Tumdn=4:S. n 3 48 I. B.498 MAD-MAD In 1882 the Mukhbir-ud-Dauleh, the Telegraph Minister, formed a com pany, rented the mines from the Persian Government for 15 years on a fixed rent of 9,000 tumdns for the first and 18,000 tumdns for each succeed ing year, and retained them till 1884. Full particulars regarding this are given in this Gazetteer (page 496). In 1885 the Malik-ut-Tujjar again obtained the mines at 9,000 tumdns a year, and held them till 1893 (during which period he is said to have made a fortune out of them) when he was ousted by the Naiyir-ud-Dau- leh, Governor of Nishapur, who increased the rent to 11,000 tumdns per annum and had the mines for two years. In 1894 the Timuri Chief and the Herat! Bankers, Haji Muhammad Hasan and Haji ’AH Akbar, rented the mines for a term of ten years at an increased annual rent of 13,200 tumdns 'per annum. This contract was signed by the late Shah himself and was confirmed by the present Shah. Despite this, it was cancelled after two years, as at the end of the year 1896-97 the rent was suddenly raised to 23,200 tumdns a year by the Malik-ut-Tujjar, who now holds the mines. The instability of the engagements of the Persian Government has been the cause of the ruin of the mines, and has prevented the contractors from working the mines systematically or carrying out any improvements. The concession for working the turquoise mines (as mentioned above) includes the Government of the Ma’dan district, comprising territory about 40 miles square, which contains 13 villages and a few small hamlets called kaldtehs with a population of about 1,500 families. The concession also includes the working of the salt and lead mines and the millstone quarry. Besides the two Ma’dan villages called Kaleh-i-Bala and Kaleh-i-Paln, there are the following villages in the district :— Sar-i-Chah (a large village situated to the north of the turquoise hills), Garmab, Marzan, Nusk, Pehna, Ardlan, Tuznadar, Tiran, Burz-i-Nun, Karakul and Khairabad. 1 The lead mine and the millstone quarry, situated in the Batau h 11s to the south of the turquoise hills, are not important, and the present contractor does not consider it worth his while to work them. The salt mines (situated about 4 or 5 miles to the east of the turquoise mines)* on the road to Nishapur, are sub-let by the contractor for 250 tumdns a year. ^ Full information is given above regarding the different mines in the turquoise hill. Stated briefly they are situated in seven different ravines called the— 1. Darreh-i ALu ’Ishq. t 2. Darreh-i-Ssfid. 3. Darreh-i-Kuh. * The salt is excavated from these by blasting with powder from the solid rock-salt of which the hill is composed. This salt is very white and clear, and at the pit mouth there was only a layer of some 20 or 30 feet of earth above it. The shaft runs straight into the hill in the form of a cave or tunnel, and requires no propping up or supports of any sort. The salt is considered superior to that obtained from salt lakes, and the mines here supply the Sabzawar, Kuchan and Bujnurd districts, the price at the pit mouth being 1 krdn (4 d.) per donkey load of 130 to ICO lb .—{C E. Yate )' MAD—MAD 499 4. Darreh-i-Siah. 5. Darreh-i-Sabz. 6. Darreh-i-Kamar 7. Darreh-i-Khiiruji. The oldest and the most important turquoise mines were the (1) Ahd-ur- Razaq and the''(2) Surkh, (3) Shahpardar and (4) Aqali mines, but these have all been filled up by careless working and are unworkable now, except at great outlay which no contractor ventures to incur, not being sure of being allowed to retain the contract to the end of his term. The most important mine now worked by the contractor is the Zak-i- tJHa (upper Zak) mine, situated in the Darreh-i-Safid. Out of the two other mines situated in the same darreh the Zak-i-Sufleh (lower Zak) is filled up and unworkable ; the MIrza Ahmadi is sub-let to the miners, who work it themselves. All these are old mines. Out of the mines situated in the Darreh-i-Kuh, only one is worked at pre sent. It is called Danaki and is sub-let to the miners. The Karbalai, Karimi and other mines in this ravine are deserted, because it does not pay to work them. The ’Ali Mlrzai and Ra’ish mines situated in the Darreh-i-Siah are sub-let to the miners who are working them at present. The contractor is working only one new mine in this ravine, which is called the Gaudal-i-Karbalal Hasan. Out of the mines situated in the Darreh-i-Sabz, the Abi and the Anjirl are subject to the miners, and the contractor works only one mine called Chiragh Kush, a branch of the Andalani, the most important old mine in this ravine, which is filled up and deserted at present. The mine in the Darreh-i-Kamar which yielded ’ arabl turquoises is filled up with water, and cannot be worked now. The Khuruji mines are also neglected at present, as it does not pay to work them. To sum up, the Mirza Ahmadi, ’Ali Mirzai, Ra’ish, Abi, Anjiri mines, and about half a dozen other minor ones are sub-let by the contractor for about 1,500 tumans per annum, and the only mines worked by the present contrac tor himself are the (1) Zak-i-Ulia, (2) Chiragh Kush, and (3) Gaudal-i- Karbalai Hasan. These mines are worked for twelve hours daily (9 a.m. to 9 p.m.) by two sets of workmen. Each set consists of four classes of workmen, viz. :— The Zdbit, or overseer, on 3 krdns a day. The Ustad, or workman, on 1J to 2 krdns a day. The Amala, or cooly, on | to 1 krdn a day. The Fala, or inferior cooly, on | to | kran a day. The overseer superintends the working of three or four workmen, a\d collects the stones. The workman excavates the rock. The cooly removes and carries the debris from the mine to the open.500 MAD—MAD The inferior cooly breaks the stones brought out of the mine and picks out the turquoises, which are collected by the Zakit. The establishment employed on the above three mines at present is:— On the Zak-i-Vlla mine *— % Between Between 9 a.m. to 3 P.M. 3 and 9 p.m. Zabita .. .. 3 3 Ustada .. .. ,. 12 12 Coolies .. .. .. .. 25 Nil On the Chirdgh Kush mines — • Zdbits .. .. .. 3 3 Ustada .. .. 12 12 Coolies .. • 6 Nil On the GaudaUi-Karboldi Hasan mine — Between Between 9 a.m. to 3 P.M. 3 and 9 P.M. Zdbita ,, ,. 3 3 Ustads .. ,, .. 12 3 Coolies 6 Nil. Two ustads make a hole about a foot long in the rock with a sharp tool and a hammer and then blast it with gunpowder. The stones thus blasted out are sent out of the mine where they are broken and the turquoises picked out. The smaller pebbles are then sifted and washed, , and the small Btones left in them collected, after which the refuse is thrown away. All the establishments employed in the three mines are under a head are kept by two mlrzds (clerks) receiving 10 tumdns each per month. Besides these, two ghuldms (mounted messengers) on 6 tumdns each per month are employed for carrying, once a week, in a sealed bag, the stones excavated in six working days (Saturday to Thursday) to the contractor at Meshed, where they are cut and set into rings for sale. Fifty soldiers of the Qardl (Turbat-i-Haidaii Battalion) under a Ndib or Jamaddr are employed as guards on the mines. Th se aro paid by the contractor at the rate of 7^ krdns each per month and are relieved every six months. * To reach it we ascended a very steep path, and had to leave our horses half-way up. It is nearly at the top and on the precipitous side of the hill, and must be considerably over 6,000 feet above the sea. At the mouth there is a small kdge with just sufficient room for half a dozen men to sit on it, and to break the fragments of rock which are being brought up continually from below. They break these frag ments with hammers, and when they discover a turquoise they extract it Avith its shell of rock, and place it on one side. And it is thus sent to Meshed. No one can really judge whether it will be good or bad till the cutter has subjected it to grinding. Around the mouth of the mine, perched on other ledges, are numbers of small boys who sift the earth of soft sandstone which comes up from the mine. The mouth of the mine is a hollowed out cave, about 12 yards across, with a shaft at the mouth about 5 yards in diameter, running straight down. Two men sit at the top and turn, with their feet, a wheel which brings up bags containing the debris, and Avhich are received, emptied and returned by another man. Forty feet down the shaft others were at work on a ledge in the same manner, so that the mine cannot be much less than 100 feet in depth and must be pretty extensh^e. Some of the mines are entered meiely by a shc.ft down which there is just room for a man to descend.— [Thomson.) kThe contractor’s working expenses (excluding the pay of the establish ment! viz the cost of gunpowder, oil, etc., are said to amount to abou 120 limans a week, and the outturn comes to between 300 and 400 iumans &amp; The^axes realized by the contractor, besides the _rent of the turquoise and salt mines sub-let to the miners, are 8,000 *wwamfrom_ 400 families of the miners living in the two Ma’dan villages, and ihO tumans from the inhabitants and owners of other villages in the Ma’dan district. The miners are not paid in cash, their wages being accounted for towards the payment of taxes. , . . ^, The out-turn of the turquoise mines during the_ year 1896-97 is sta ed on good authority to have amounted to 19,000 tumans.—{C. E. l ate, 18^7.) ***** 10^ May 1899.—In the afternoon I visited the Ma’dan-i-Ra ishi in a hill overlooking Ma’dan. 1 t, - • n Below it on the opposite side of the hill is the Abd-ur-Razaq mine, and below it again lie the Dikud Bam and Chiragh Kush mines. llth May 1899.—In the forenoon I visited the Ma dan-i- Abd-ur-Rr zaq. It lay about half a mile from the village and some 500 feet up the hi . The outside is a great cave in the rock which contains several galleries, all of which have separate names. The Malik-ut-Tujjar of Meshed has farmed the turquoise mines at an annual rent of 24,000 tumdns for ten years. This siim includes the rent of salt mines, which are four in number, together with millstone quarries and the village of Ma dan. The following mines are worked at present: 1. Karbalai Hasani. 2. Ra’ishi. 3. Mirza Ahmadi. 4. Karbalai Kaiimi. 5. Zaki. 6. Tilai. 7. ’Abd-ur-Raz^q. These mines are named after the persons who worked them in former It is said that the best turquoises are found in the Karbalai Kaiimi mine, but the ’Abd-ur-Razaq also produces really good stones. Owing to no money being expended the mine fell in and was not worked for a long time. It is now being worked again. _ . The ’Abd-ur-Razaq mine is situated m a hill known as Kuh-i-Abu Ishaqi, and near to it there are the following mines which, being filled^up, a,re not worked at present, and are considered parts of the ’Abd-ur-Razaq mine 1 Rashid Khani. 2. Pustini.502 MAD—MAD 3. Kalantari. 4. Chilma Band!. 5. Chehil Nafari. 6. Jeliangiri. Besides the above there are other mines also which are filled up, and not worked at present. Their names are as follows :— 1. Anjiri. 2. Ardalani. 3. Ghar-i-Sabz 4. Kamari. 5. Siah. • The range of hills, in which the above mines and those which are at pre sent worked are situated, is known as Kuh-i-Ma’dan. A large sum of money is required to clear out these mines. Hitherto contracts after being sold have been cancelled and given to higher bidders, to the great detriment of the mines. The Malik-ut-Tujjar has the necessary capital, but will not expend it. The work of mining is carried on by means of pickaxes, crowbars and blast ing, the latter, besides being dangerous to the labourers, spoils the turquoises in a great measure. The former tries to make as much money as he can re gardless of damage being done to the mines. The industry is consequently being injured. Formerly some of the mines were sub-rented to the villagers, who used to work for themselves independently of the contractor, selling the stones to dealers or the contractor himself, but all the mines are at present worked by the Malik-ut-Tujjar himself, and he has besides prohibited the sale of turquoises at Ma’dan on penalty of severe punishment, which has caused great rise in the value of turquoises. Still, the labourers, when working in the mines, steal turquoises, but cannot sell them openly at Ma’dan, but when collected the turquoises are taken to Meshed, Sabzawar and Nlsha- pur, where they are sold. There are three gangs of labourers, numbering about 300 persons, who work in the mines day and night. The first gang works from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., the second from 2 p.m. to 8 a.m. and the third from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The mines are very dark and the work of mining is carried on by the light of lamps in which country oil is used. The Malik-ut-Tujjar has the following establishment at the Ma’dan :— 1. Mubashir, or manager of the mines. 2. Naib, or the official in charge of the 2 hamlets of the Ma’dan. 3. Mustaufi, or Accountant. Zabits (watchmen) 20. There is also a detachment of Persian Infantry posted at Ma’dan. As soon as turquoises are taken out of the mines, one of the Zabits who is al ways present at the mines takes them over, and having put them in a bag, seals it and sends it to the Mubashir, who weekly despatches the bag to Meshed to the Malik-ut-Tujjar. The turquoises are not cut or dressed at Ma’dan, and therefore it is impossible to value the daily or weekly outturn.It is said that about a hundred thousand tumdns worth of turquoises were taken out of the mines last year. The expenditure incurred at the Ma’dan is given as follows :— Tumdns. Rent of the mines Presents distributed to the ministers and other officials Pay of the establishment and wages of the labourers 24.000 6,000 20.000 Total .. 60,000 The balance of 50,000 tumdns includes wages of cutting and dressing stone charges for exporting turquoises to Europe, Russia and India and the profit of the Malik-ut-Tujjar. Only a very small number of turquoises are sold at Meshed by the Malik- ut-Tujjar, as he puts very high prices on them. Stones of superior quality are exported to Russia and other countries in Europe, and those of inferior quality are exported to India. The village of Ma’dan has two hamlets, and the number of families living in them is estimated to be about four hundred. About three hundred per sons work in the turquoise mines. The natives of the Ma’dan village are exempted from the payment of duty at the salt mines and millstone quar ries, provided they work these mines for themselves, but others are charged one Jcrdn per donkey-load of salt. Besides the rock mines there are mines in mounds of earth called Ma’dan- i-Khaki. Stones of the most perfect colour and quality are found in these mines, which are far less productive as regards numbers of stones than those found in the rock mines. The Khaki mines are free from taxation. Very little cultivation is carried on at the village of Ma’dan. The pro duce is insufficient for the consumption of the people. At a distance frem Ma’dan there is a lead mine in a hill, which was once worked. There are six qandts of water at the village of Ma’dan, supplies are procur able.

The district suffered much by the great flood of 1870, which destroyed some villages and many gardens. It grows cotton and raises some silk. It pays very little to the Government, but 200 of its men are supposed to be always in readiness to accompany and pro tect caravans going to and coming from Shahrud. The district has eleven villages.—(1) Mazinan, (2) Behmanabad, (3) Saviz, (4) Davarzan, (5) Kaha,_(6) Nehardan, (7) Abrud, (8) Biza, (9) Mur, (10) Kamiabin (also Chanhabun), (11) Kalaleh. To the latter belong several small hamlets to the east of the village of Mazinan. The mountain due north of the latter is the Kuh-i-Biza. The principal water-supply of the district is the stream which comes from the Garra Kuh, the western part of the Juvain or Jagha- tai mountain. The ground is very fertile, and the corn-fields of Mazi nan are of vast extent. On the south and west the district is bounded by a kavlr or salt marsh, on the north by the Saviz and Jaghatai mountains on the east the plain extends to Sabzawar.—(NcAMer.)

It is the principal place of the Mazinan district {q.v., and has 300 houses. The present village was built within the last 17 years after the o.d \illage, 2 mile to the south, was almost totally destroyed by a great flood. The new village is enclosed by a wall with 20 towers, and occupies the site of Yangi Kakh, built during Fath ’Ali Shah’s reign by the rebel Allah Yar Khan Qilichi of Juvain. Mazinan has a post house, a telegraph station, a good public bath, a mosque and a college. Between old and new Mazinan (the former now completely deserted) is a fine cara vanserai built by Shah ’Abbas II, in A. H. 1074, and close by there are the ruins of a very ancient building called the Caravanserai Mamurii v from the Abbasi KLaliieh of that name), the bricks of which measured 30 x 27 x 8 centimetres. Out of the 200 tufangchi which the Mazinan dis trict has to supply, this village has to provide 50.

MESHED (No. 1) (City)—Lat. 36° 17' 13'; Long. 59° 36' 15'Elev. 3,104'.— {Lemm.) A city, the capital of Khora-an, situated near the eastern frontier of that province, about 545 miles east of Tehran, Situation. 234 miles north-west of Herat, and 177 miles, sou’-sou’-east of Astarabad. The Meshed valley, on the south-west edge of which the city is situated, is a narrow, cigar-shaped basin or depression 10 or 15 miles wide, and at least 150 miles long from north-west to south-east, contracting very rapidly at its south-east extremity. It is traversed by the Kashaf Kud on its course south-east to join the Hari Rud, the river at its nearest point to the town lying about 4 miles to the north-east. The south-western mo-untain wall—a flexure of the main Nlshapur range—approaches to a little more than 2 miles from the city, the in tervening space—sandy and little cultivated—and, indeed, the city itself, sloping gently up to the south-west. The neighbourhood of the city is- here much intersected by qandts. The principal or best known peaks of this subsidiary range, of which the summit forms a slightly cup-shaped and irregular plateau some 500 feet above Meshed, are taken in order from south-east to north-west, known as Kuh-i-Chang Kalagh, Kuh-i-Klialaj, Kuh-i-Majuni, Kuh-i-Abshar, Kuh-i- Sangi, a small, isolated double cone on the plain to the w T est of the Ark gate, Kuh-i-Zakharia, Kuh-i-Nandanxh, Kuh-i-Vairani and Kuh-i-Band-i- Gulistan. This range is said to contain a vein of gold, the expense of working which has been greater than the resultant profit, and to it lead several rough cart-roads, merging, as the hills are reached, into mule-tracks, by which the stone foL building and other purposes is conveyed to the city. From the south to the south-east of the town lie low, rocky hills at dis tances varying from 5 to 15 miles, the Kashaf Rud escaping at the south east angle of the chain and its valley narrowing to a restricted gorge before reaching Pul-i-Khatun. To the north-east, a fertile plain from 10 to 15 miles in width separates Meshed from its north-eastern barrier, a range with a general altitude of 6,000 to 7,000 feet, rising at its highest point in the Hazar Jarib moun tains to 9,700 feet. Here the plain is dotted with frequent villages which, with their surrounding cultivation, extend up to the walls of the city, the richest villages occurring in the vicinity of the Kashaf Rud. To the north and again to the east, south-east, and south, a belt o£ walled vineyards and fruit-gardens extends outwards from J mile to 1 mile from the walls.5H MES-MES Communicationa. From Meshed the principal routes leave the city as follows :— (1) At the north-west corner by the Bala Khiaban Grate to Kuchan, whence it branches to Askhabad and to Bujnurd. (No. 44, Yol. 1 Kontes). (2) At the south side by the Idgah or Pain Khiaban Gates to Sharif- abad (21 miles), whence it branches to Tehran (545 miles) and to Turbat-i-Haidari (82 miles). (3) At the south-east face by the Pain Khiaban Gate to Herat (234 miles). (4) At the south-east face by the Pain Khiaban Gate, branching at Robat-i-Mahi to Pul-i-Khatun (88 miles) and Sarakhs (99 miles). (5) At the north-east face by the Naughan Gate branching at Qardeh to Kakhka (90 miles) and Kalat-i-Nadiri (72 miles). (6) At the west face by the Sarrab Gate to Nishapur (66 miles) vid Gulistan and Jagharq. This is a shorter route than that by Sharifabad, but being a somewhat difficult mule-track, it is used by caravans in summer only. The first three of the above-mentioned routes, though in many parts susceptible of improvement and repair, are crossable for their whole extent. On the Meshed-Tehran route (vid Nishapur, Sabzawar, and Samnan) relays of horses are maintained for the postal waggons and for travellers’ carriages, 8 being the normal number of horses available at each stage. On the Askhabad route no relays of horses are at present available, but it is more than probable that the Russians will shortly inaugurate a relay service. A constant stream of fourgons conveys goods to and from Askhabad, and in lesser number to and from Tehran. The establishment of the Meshed Post Office os s * consists of a Postmaster and 5 clerks. Posts leave the city as follows : — Monday. —To Askhabad, Sarakhs and Sistan. Tuesday. —To Tehran. Thursday. —To Askhabad and Sistan. Saturday. —To Askhabad and Tehran. Parcels from England or the Continent should be addressed to the frontier village Gaudan-Bajgiran via Askhabad. Parcels addressed via Bushire take 70 days en route: those by Askhabad 20 days.

All the above lines are single with wooden poles of local make. Juniper is preferred, where obtainable, owing to its immunity from the ravages of white ants, but poplar is frequently used, particularly in the neighbour hood of Meshed. The Persian Government farms out the Directorship of the Khorasan tele graphs, the present lessee being the Khabir-us-Saltaneh, resident at Meshed. The establishment of the Meshed telegraph office consists of a Nazim, with a Cashier and Accountant, an English signaller of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, two Russian signallers, one Armenian and two Persian signallers. The history of Meshed constitutes an epitome of that of Khorasan, and in no small degree bears upon the fortunes of 18 01y ' the ruling dynasties of Persia. It is a long record of conquest and counter-conquest, plunder and restitution, of which the merest abstract can be given here. The city, as indeed its name implies (Meshed sc. “ place of witness or martyrdom”) owes its very existence to the shrine, the last resting-place of the revered saint Imam Riza, with which its history is intimately and inextricably connected. Imam Riza, son of Imam Musa, and 8th of the 12 Imams or prophets, had before his death, which occurred during the ninth century in the ancient city of Tus, indicated the walled village of Sanabad as the place of his sepulchre, and Ibn Haukul (circa 902—968 A.) refers to the tomb of both the Imam and the famous Khalif Harun-ar-Rashid as at Sanabad, and elsewhere, as at Naughan, a town which existed in the vicinity. The name of Sanabad to-day survives only in one of the canals conveying water to the city, and that of Naughan in one of the city quarters. As far as the tangled skein of antiquity can be unravelled, we gather that the city of Tus, the ruins of which lie some 14 miles to the nor’-nor’-west of Meshed, was founded by Tus, one of the heroes of Fir dausi’s Shahnameh, and finally destroyed in 1389 A.D., after a protracted siege, by Miranshah, son of Tamarlane, when engaged in suppressing a revolt against his father’s authority. The city was razed and 10,000 of the population massacred, and, owing to its destruction and to the growing 3 T 2MG MES—MES attraction of the tomb of the holy Imam at Sanabad, which had already caused the absorption of much of the population of Tus, the present city of Meshed sprang into being. In 1037 A.D., during the reign of Sultan Mas’ud Ghasnavi, the dome of the shrine was built and some fortifications erected by Suri, Governor of Nlshapiir, and in 1121 A.D., a wall was built which sufficed to protect the town against a raid of the Ghaz Turkomans in 1153, but did not avail against the same aggressors 8 years later, when the town was plundered, but the shrine spared. In 1296, soon after the accession of Ghazan, great-grandson of Hulaku Khan, to the throne, the Tartar princes rose against him and one of them, D ud, son of Burah, sacked Meshed among other towns of Khorasan. Meshed is mentioned by Yaqut, and also by Batuta who travelled in Kho rasan in 1334, as a populous town. From his account it is apparent that it had already attained to considerable importance even before the complete destruction of Tus, and that it was at that time, owing to the tomb of the Khalif Hamn, as much a resort of Sunni, as of Shi’ah, pilgrimage. In 1418, Sultan Shah Rukh made a pilgrimage to Meshed and presented the shrine with a golden candelabrum, and the same year saw the comple tion of the mosque built by his wife, Gauhar Shad. In 1507, during the reign of Shaibani Khan, the Usbegs captured the city and massacred many of the inhabitants, and in 1525, at the commence ment of the reign of Shah Tahm Asp, it was once again besieged and taken by Ubaid Khan Usbeg. Tahm Asp retook it in 1528, but owing to the unfinished condition of the city walls, he was only enabled to finally secure it two years later. A further siege by Ubaid Khan in 1535 was rendered abortive by the strength of the city defences, but the efforts of Muhammad Sultan Usbeg to capture the city in 1544 were attended by success, and many of the inhabitants were put to the sword. In 1579, and again in 1581, Murtaza Qull Khan, a Governor appointed two years previously by Shah Isma’Il II, unsuccessfully attempted to hold tFe city against ’All Quli Khan, the guardian of the young Shah ’AbbUs, whose head-quarters it became prior to his assumption of the reins of Gov- -ernment at Kazvin. The most serious calamity which had as yet overtaken the city occur red in 1589, when, after a siege of four months, Meshed fell to the victorious arms of ’Abdul Mumin Khan, Governor of Balkh. In the general massacre which ensued even the priests and Saiyids were not spared : the shrine was sacked and its costly treasures and rare manuscripts became the prey of the victorious Usbegs. Nine years later, on the flight of the Usbegs, Shah ’Abbas re-occupied the city, restored the shrine, and with the proceeds of the famous diamond presented by Qutb Shah of the Deccan, lost in the siege and finally restored by an Usbeg prince, purchased lands on its behalf. In 1601, the same monarch still further beautified this edifice and con structed the Khlaban or main street, and his successors when visiting Meshed left traces of their presence by their munificence to the holy fane. After a comparatively protracted period of peace, the city was again to experience the shock of war in 1726 when Malik Mahmud SistanI, who had •occupied Meshed in 1722, sustained two menths’ siege against Shah TahmMES—MES MG attraction of the tomb of the holy Imam at Sanabad, which had already caused the absorption of much of the population of Tus, the present city of Meshed sprang into being. In 1037 A.D., during the reign of Sultan Mas’ud Ghasnavl, the dome of the shrine was built and some fortifications erected by Surl, Governor of Nishapur, and in 1121 A.D., a wall was built which sufficed to protect the town against a raid of the Ghaz Turkomans in 1153, but did not avail against the same aggressors 8 years later, when the town was plundered, but the shrine spared. In 1296, soon after the accession of Ghazan, great-grandson of Hulaku Khan, to the throne, the Tartar princes rose against him and one of them, D ud, son of Burah, sacked Meshed among other towns of Khorasan. Meshed is mentioned by Yaqut, and also by Batuta who travelled in Kho rasan in 1334, as a populous town. From his account it is apparent that it had already attained to considerable importance even before the complete destruction of Tus, and Chat it was at that time, owing to the tomb of the Khallf Harun, as much a resort of Sunni, as of Shi’ah, pilgrimage. In 1418, Sultan Shah Rukh made a pilgrimage to Meshed and presented the shrine with a golden candelabrum, and the same year saw the comple tion of the mosque built by his wife, Gauhar Shad. In 1507, during the reign of Shaibani Khan, the Usbegs captured the city and massacred many of the inhabitants, and in 1525, at the commence ment of the reign of Shah Tahm Asp, it was once again besieged and taken by Ubald Khan Usbeg.

Again in 1729, this time against a fresh enemy—an Abdali Afghan force from Herat—siege was laid to the town, which under Ibrahim Khan, brother of Nadir Quli Beg Afshar, succeeded in holding the enemy at bay till Nadir himself came to the rescue. Once more, after an interval of 20 years, we find Meshed involved in th e events of this turbulent period, for it was in 1749 that Mirza Saiyid Muham- ^ mad, the Mutavall or guardian of the shrine, treacherously seized and blinded Shah Rukh, himself assuming the title of Shah Sulaiman, only to undergo the same fate in his turn. After the re-instatement of Shah Rukh, the shrine fared badly at the hands of his sons Nasrullah Mirza and Nadir Mirza, each of whom plundered it in turn. On the capture of Meshed by Ahmad Shah Abdali of Herat, Shah Rukh was left in possession till his final deposition at the hands of Aqa Muhammad Shah in 1796. At this period the fortunes of the city, harried by incessant Turkoman raids, were at their lowest, and the population had sunk from 60,000 to 20,000. In 1802, Nadir Mirza held the city against the Kajar troops. To obtain the sinews of war he again had recourse to the treasures of the shrine, but his efforts were unavailing and he was captured and sent to Tehran, where he was put to death by Fath 5 Ali Shah. ► This latter monarch visited the city in 1818, and built the new court of the shrine, the Sahn-i-Nau. From 1825 to 1828, the city and surrounding district suffered from the raids of the Khan of Khiva, till order was for the time restored by a Per sian force under ’Abbas Mirza. For close on 20 years comparative peace prevailed in the city, which was, however, involved in the rebellion of Hasan Khan Salar in 1847. The Hashmat-ud-Dauleh, who had been deput ed to suppress the revolt, occupied the town till ejected by a rising of the people, in which 700 Persian troops were slain. The great privations endured by the people induced them to turn against the Salar two years later. He was seized in the shrine whither he had fled, and was subsequently executed by the Shah’s decree. During the last 50 years of the nineteenth century, Meshed has been on several occasions visited by the reigning Shah, and various additions and adornments have been made to the shrine. A severe outbreak of cholera occurred in 1868, followed three years later by a famine which devastated the whole oi Jvnorasan. Immunity against the raids of the Turkomans was not secured till the Russian victory at Guk Tappeh (Geok Tepe) in 1880 reduced these robbers to subjection. Since that date the defences have been suffered to fall into their present ruinous condition. In 1892, cholera again visited the city, and in 1904 that dread scourge claimed some 8 000 victims. The town of Meshed averages about 1| to 2 miles in length by 1 mile in Descriptions of the city. breadth &gt; and ^ surrounded by a mud wall of very irregular trace, with a circumference of518 MES—MES I approximately 6 miles. Its contour is roughly circular. At the angles are Defences bastions in the shape of round mud towers, and at intervals along the wall small towers are distributed. The wall, originally 9 feet thick at the base and 4 feet thick at the top, with a small ditch below the rampart, a low parapet on the crest of the counterscarp, and a broad and deep ditch beyond, is now much eroded by weather and neglect, and together with the bastions has fallen into utter disrepair, in many places permitting the passage of a man, and in several that of a horse ; while the ditch has in many parts entirely disappeared and only presents its original dimensions near the Ark Gate. At this point a small overflow stream exists in the ditch, and a sufficiently formidable obstacle could be created by damming the stream. A rough road makes the circuit of the city. Gates. The wall is pierced by 6 main gates, viz. :— The Bala Khiaban .. .. North-west. The Sarrab .. .. West. The Ark The Idgah The Pain Khiaban The Naughan .. South-west. .. South. .. South-east. .. North-east. The Customs maintain posts for the examination of goods entering the city by the Bala and Pain Khiaban and Idgah Gates, the introduction of any commodities by the others being prohibited. The construction of a seventh gate for Customs purposes between the Ark and Sarrab Gates is shortly to be undertaken, while the Russian Bank has built a gate in the south-west face between the Ark and Idgah Gates for communication with their recently acquired residential premises at Takkiabad, a walled garden about | mile to the south-west of the city. Meshed is divided into 7 principal quarters, viz. :— Quarters (1) Bala Khiaban. (2) Naughan. (3) Pain Khiaban. (4) Idgah. (5) Sarshur. (6) Sarrab. With the exception of the Sarshur quarter, which occupies the space between the Idgah quarter, the shrine and the Ark, and includes the main covered bazar, all the above lie in the vicinity of the gates which bear their names. (7) The Chcharbagh, in the centre of the town, south-east of the Sarrab quarter between the latter and the Bast, contains the telegraph office, a branch of the post office and offices of forwarding agents. The most distinctive feature of the ground plan of the city is the Khiaban or main avenue, which intersects Meshed from T ie ia ^n. jts north-west to its south-east corner. Its total length is a little short of 2 miles and its average breadth about 25 yards. The surface is roughly paved with cobble stones : down the centre runs a canal, the water of which is used by the inhabitants for every imaginablepurpose, and the banks are planted at irregular intervals with chindrs, mulberries, elms and poplars. The street is still further embellished by a row of ricketty lamp-posts, and fringed on either side by shops of every description. It is thronged during the busy part of the day by a dense crowd representative of all the classes of inhabitants and pilgrims to be found in Meshed. The street is not, however, available for traffic for its entire extent, as, at about two-thirds of its length from the north-west end, an archway occurs which marks the bounds of the Bast or sacred precincts of the shrine. Beyond this, none except Muhammadans, and no animal or vehicle, may proceed. So strictly is this enforced that any animal straying within the forbidden area becomes the property of the shrine. All traffic is here diverted and forced to pass by the narrow lanes which bound the sacred quarter, to re-enter the Khiaban to the south-east of the Bast. Before continuing the general account of the city, it is perhaps as well rvu -o a ■ to 8 ive some description of the sacred quarter and the Sahn or shrine itself. This latter, a parallelogram with its greatest length east and westwards, is surrounded on all sides by the Bast or sanctuary, the whole covering an area of a square £ mile. Immediately beyond the barrier in the Khiaban, the street continues to run for a 100 yards or more through a crowded bazar up to the main entrance of the mosques. Within the precincts of the Bast the pilgrim can find lodging for himself, and shops to supply his wants. The rent of these shops, which are much sought after, is higher than that outside this area and the various commodities sold are consequently dearer. Here the ground is considered the property of the Imam himself, and the Muhammadan male factor, so long as he remains within its pale, can find a sanctuary inviolal le in theory but by no means so in practice. At the end of the bazar of the Bast, a lofty archway rising high above the adjoining wall, leads into the Sahn-i-Kuhneh, the principal court of the holy buildings. This is a noble quadrangle, 150 yards long by 75 wide, flagged with grave-stones of the wealthy departed, and surrounded by a double storey of recessed alcoves. In the centre of the court stands a small octagonal kiosque, covering a fountain which is supplied by the main Khiaban canal, and surrounded by a stone channel constructed by Shah ’Abbas. Owing to the pollution of this water on its way through the city, the Naiyir-ud-Dauleh, a recent Governor- General of Khorasan, constructed an additional channel alongside the original one, with four basins near the fountain, to supply the faithful with pure water for their ablutions. Upon the four sides of the court, the walls between and above the recesses are faced with enamelled tiles, and in the centre of each rises a gigantic portal, or aivdn, embellished with collossal tiles, and bearing, in Kufic, verses from the Koran. By the eastern aivdn, access is obtained to the tomb-chamber of the Imam, and its special character is indicated bv the gilding with which the upper half is overlaid. The Sahn contains two minarets, the older of the two built by Shah Isma’il or Shah Tahm Asp, springing from the Mausoleum itself. The upper part of these minarets is in each case overlaid with gilded copper plates, and is crowned with the cage-like gallery common to the Persian style520 MES—MES The chief glory of the enclosure is, however, the sepulchre of the Imam. The tomb itself is preceded by a spacious chamber whose marble floor is overlaid with rich carpets. Above it to a height of 77 feet swells the main cupola, whose gilded exterior marks the spot to the advancing pilgrim. The walls are adorned with kashi, or enamelled tiles, above which are broad bands of the same material in Arabic writing, and are hung with rare and precious jewels of immense value. The tomb itself in a corner of the chamber—the centre space being occupi ed by that of the renowned Harun-ar-Rashid—is surrounded by three rail ings of steel, silver and gold, respectively. Three doors lead to the shrine, one of silver, the second—the gift of Fath ’AH Shah—of gold plates studded with precious stones, and the third, a carpet sewn with pearls. Nothing remains to distinguish the tomb of the great Khalif which was levelled soon after the accession of the Safavi dynasty. At the south-west corner of the Sahn-i-Kuhneh lies the Sahn-i-Nau, or new court, built in 1818 by Fath ’AH Shah. To the south of the tomb of Imam Riza, and situated obliquelv to it, is the mosque built by Gauhar Shad. Like the other, it has a large court with two storeys of recessed apartments afl'round, with soaring, tile-covered aivdns, and with two great ungilt, but tile-encircled, minarets. The dome, which is larger and loftier than that of Imam Riza, is covered with tiles of blue, green and orange patterns. Entrance is found in the Sahn-i-Kuhneh to a madraseh, or religious college erected by Haji Mi rza Ja’afar, a wealthy Persian merchant, which resembles the mosque and the mausoleum in structural features and decoration. Also included in the parallelogram are other madrasehs, courts, caravan serais, and baths, as well as kitchens, a prison under the jurisdiction of the Mutavalll BashI, a hospital, and a great refectory where the pilgrims are fed at the expense of the Imam, each new-comer being entitled to three days’ gratuitous board. From all accounts peculation is rife in this latter department. The library of the shrine, dating from the time of Shah Rukh, contains some 3,000 works, a third of which are Kordns, chiefly manuscripts of great beauty of execution. The whole of the shrine is now lighted by electricity, the installation dating from 1893. A curious system of dual control prevails in Meshed, the temporal power A . . . . . C11 . being represented by the Governor-General, ministration o t e nne. re p resen t a tive of the Shah, and the spiritual by the MutavalH Bashi, the head of the shrine and mouthpiece of the Imam. The jurisdiction of the latter is absolute within the Bast or sacred precincts with certain reservations, for the system of dual control extends to within even the Shrine itself, a descendant of the Imam and the head of the Razavi Saiyids, permanently holding the hereditary office of Qdimmaqdm, and acting as a check on the actions of the MutavalH Bashi, who is in reality in the position of an executive head, or president, of a committee. The word mouthpiece is used advisedly, as the Imam is in theory still alive. This strange fiction is maintained in divers ways, the telegram des patched by the Shah to the Imam to inaugurate the telegraph line beinga case in point. In addition, the Imam yearly despatches a dress of honour to the Shah on Nau Ruz, appointing him a Khadm or servant of the Shrine for the ensuing year, and the offerings in return for the oracular responses given by the Imam to the anxious enquiries of numerous pilgrims, form no small part of the perquisiues of the attendant? mujtuhids and inullds. The appointment of the Mutavalli Basin lies in the hands of the Shah, and the office has no fixed tenure. It is not necessarily vested in the hand of an ecclesiastic, and the influence exerted by the incumbent often equals, and has sometimes exceeded, that of the Governor-General. In some cases the two offices have been combined in the same individual. The first in stance occurred in 1845, and the precedent has more than once been followed in latter years. There are some 20 mujtahids or chief priests, and the same number of superior Shrine officials. For the every day service of the Shrine there exist five Kashiks or reliefs, each Kashik taking the duty in turn. A Sar- kashik or headman, usual!v a high official of the Shrine, directs each relief, which, with subordinate officials and attendants, numbers about 170 persons! The revenue, about 9o per cent, of which is derived from endowed landed Revenue ot the Shrine. , and ho fe Property, and 5 per cent, from burial tees and other items, amounts to tumdns J00,000, and the expenses always equal and sometimes exceed this sum. It is said that the revenue under capable and honest administration should be much greater. With the exception of the Rhiaban, the streets of Meshed are little more than The citv continued. narrow lanes enclosed by high mud walls, the principal roads being roughly paved with cobbles. The bazars are confined to no particular quarter and are in no wise Bazars. noteworthy. The principal is the covered bazar m the Sarslmr quarter, and smaller bdza/rs. usually covered, are distributed throughout the town. The houses are in general built of mud at a lower level than the street Buildings. and are slmt o: ff ^7 high mud walls through which a low door leads down to the courtyard. Ihey are usually two-storeyed, and among them are many more ambitious structures of brick built by the wealthier mhabitanfs, Turks, and others. A distinctive feature is the bddglr or wind tower, so common in Persia. Although the total number of mosques amounts to 50, few buildings of interest are found outside the Shrine precincts. The most eonsiderable mosques are the Masjid-i-Shah and the Masjid-i-Zuffikar in the Sarshur quarter, the Masjid-i-Idgah and Masjid-i-Ba-a Khiaban : these, with the mausoleums of Gumbaz-i-Sabz—a half-ruined structure near the citadel of comparatively recent date—and Pir-i-Palanduz (A.D. 1577) being done worthy of mention. ’ 6 ' Of the numerous cemeteries which in violation of every sanitarv law are The Qatl Gah. scattered throughout the city, the principal is the Qatl Gah in the Naughan quarter, a tem porary resting-place m which is eagerly sought after and well paid for by the524 MES—MES number of Karabaghi Turks (the latter Russian subjects), and by thousands of Hazaras and Barbans who are the hewers of wood and drawers of waSr in tU total 011 ’ T r ®P reSentatlves of the Masses enumerated below are included m the total In the absence of a census it is impossible to determine the approximate proportion of the various classes.

With regard to the former accusation, it is probab’e that matters stand to-day much as they did in earlier years. The presence of a number of credulous and emotional pilgrims must neces sarily breed—in other countries as well as in Persia—a host of greedy adventurers who look to the pilgrim as a source of livelihood, and the system of temporary marriages permitted to the latter dui’ing their stay in the Holy City is little less than legalized prostitution on a large scale. As to the fanaticism, although undoubtedly present and to a great extent difficult to gauge in its consequences, it is probable that it has been in no small degree exaggerated, and the leaven of the Sunni sect undoubt edly acts as a check on the more fanatical of the Shi’ah population. It may well be considered that the Anti-Armenian riots which occurred during the Mukarram festival of 1905, and which were chiefly engineered by the Karabaghi Turks in revenge for the death of their countrymen at the hands of Baku Armenians, would have assumed a far more serious complexion than was actually the case had the inherent fanaticism of the people of Meshed been of a virulent character. ♦ In addition it may be mentioned that the Europeans resident at Meshed have hitherto enjoyed complete immunity from insult or violence at the hands of the inhabitants. At all times a floating population composed o c the pilgrims to the Shrine . of Imam R : za is to be found in the city. No Pilgrims. • , j. . . J means exist of ascertaining their exact numbers, but it may be taken that during the seasons favourable for travel, the number present at any given time does not fall far short of 10,000, while during the winter, their total wou 1 d hardly exceed 1,000. The administration of Meshed, exclusive, of course, of the Bast, is vest- j * ed in the Governor-General of Khorasan who resides m the citadel, the Beglerbegi, assist ed by; a no means large staff of farrashes, is more immediately responsible for the order of the city, such policing as exists being carried out by his men and by the soldiers in the various qardual khdnehs. The Belgian Director-General of the Khorasan Customs, assisted b 7 three Belgian officials and a subordinate Persian Staff, is resident at Meshed. Meshed city is assessed at *tumdns 30,200 mallal paid in cash. The „ Customs revenue of Meshed is now included in nevonue. fche total for Khorasan. In 1889, both a British and a Russian Consulate-General were estab- „ . „ , , lished at Meshed. The European Staff of the I oreign Consulate t „ • . r .i ^ i/^ i former normally consists of the Consul-General, * Vice-Consul and Agency Surgeon, and a Military Attache. An escort of some 25 Indian savdrs is attached to the Consulate-General. *The Governor-General gives the revenue of Meshed city: Ts. 30.000 200 35.000 Artisans ., Gipsies Nishapur mines paid at Heshod526 MES—MES The Russian establishment includes the Consul-General, Vice-Consul, Dragoman, Military Attache and a medical officer. The escort is usually composed of some 25 Russian and a few Persian Cossacks. Afghanistan is represented by a trade Agent or Tujjdrbdshl. The arms of the Russian Consulate were (in June 1906) reported to con sist of :— 126 magazine rifles, 14 double rifles and 32 “officers” rifles, various. Ammuriition:— Small arms 7,000 rounds ; 5 boxes containing 24 bombs each ; 8 boxes gunpowder. The garrison of Meshed consists of two infantry regiments, about 500 strong each. One of these regiments is a regular infantry regiment, the other is the BeglerbegVs or police regiment. They are armed with Werndl breech loading rifles, though the latter are generally in store and the men provided with sticks or old muzzle-loading muskets. The men have no regular barracks and are distributed throughout the city in the various qardval khdnehs or guard-houses. Many of them are employed as door-keepers and for odd jobs by the European residents and well-to-do inhabitants. The infantry find a detachment of nominally about 100 men each at Kalat-i-Nadiri and Muhsinabad ; also a detachment of 100 at Sarakhs. (Probably the detachments all told amount to about | battalion of, say, 250 men.) The detachments are relieved about once a year. In front of the artillery barracks in the Maidan are eight muzzle-loading field-guns, and a percentage of artillerymen are stationed in these barracks. In the inner court yard is a large and antiquated gun dating from the time of Nadir Shah. There an also in the Ark 3 more M. L. field guns. All these are rifled guns, about 9-pounders, in fairly good order, i.e., the guns are not honey combed with rust nor are the wheels broken. There are also in the ark 2 brass mountain guns : these are nearly new and in good order, they seem about 4-pounder guns, M. L. Situated as it is at a moderate elevation, with a dry atmosphere, a porous soil, no extreme heat in summer and free from severe winds,Meshed enjoys an excellent climate. The surface soil in the Meshed valley is largely sand and gravel. Towards the base of the near hills on the south west the gravel is mixed with rock. Owing to the proximity of these hills, the town is well protected ” from winds from that quarter. The prevailing ^ wind is from the east and north-east: this blows throughout the greater part of the summer. In winter the direction of the wind is more variable. The average rainfall for the five years 1900 to 1904 was 7*82 inches, excluding snow. There is no complete record Rain and snow. ^ ^} ie sn0 wfall, but it may be taken that 18 inches is about the average annual depth of snow. The rain falls mostly during the early spring and late autumn, during the months of March and April, and November and December. The spring rainfall is usually Climate. Soil.528 MES—MES the Khiaban the channel is nothing more than an open sewer. In spite of this, many of the poorer people use the water for drinking and other purposes. This is largely due to laziness on their part and indifference to filth, as there is no need for them to use this water, for parallel with this open sewer, there runs underground the comparatively clean and protected water of a qanat built by the Naiyir-ud-Dauleh, and referred to e ore. Its water is made accessible to the public by the presence at frequent intervals of closed wells, which are reached through small trap doors contained in the side walls of the stone shelters built above them Ihis qanat also has its source about 40 miles distant in the Chashmeh-i- Giias spring. There are several other important qandts running near or partly through the city, and all taking their origin in the Kuh-i-Band-i- trulistan.

A water-famine is scarcely known r but after seasons of light snow or little rain water for agricultural purposes becomes expensive. The well water of the city is always contaminated by excremental Quality. matter, etc., that of the Khiakan canal is fouled near the town and is unfit for consumption. The water of the qandts having tkeir origin near Gulistan is clear, sparkling, and free from unpleasant taste : in some of them, however, it is some what hard, and in some contains enough sulphuretted hydrogen to blacken surgical or steel instruments left in it for a short time. The water of liese qardts is safe until it comes to the surface. As soon, however, as the native can get at it, he systematically fouls it by washing his linen it) even if he does not use the stream for baser purposes. Ihe drinking water for many of the Europeans of Meshed is obtained genera y from the Qanat-i-Gul-i-Khatml, at a place about one mile out side the Ark Gate. At the spot where the water of this qandi reaches theMES—MBS 529 surface the place is walled round, and the stream at this point has its sides lined with large slabs of stone : a large earthenware pipe conducts the water into the open space, and another similar pipe leads it out at the exit end, where it again disappears for a short distance underground, A scheme is on foot to raise the height of the walls of this place and to close the entrance with a padlocked gate, so as to render this source of supply perfectly safe for Europeans. There are no places especially set apart for the washing of soiled linen. ™ T . , 7 The native sets himself down to wash his clothes Dhooies ghats. . i • &lt; . i • i in any spot convenient to him, this may be at the source of a drinking water-supply. If the spot is open and easily acces sible, so much the better ; and many such open places in the vicinity of the city on the course of the qandts are used for this purpose. On several occasions, natives have been found washing clothes at the place mentioned above, where the Europeans’ drinking water is obtained, hence the scheme for closing the approach. Public baths, or hammdms, are many, and to be found in all parts of ^ ^ the town. The weekly bath is a fixed institution with all Persians, who are not too poor to pay the small sum required for admission. Each hammdm has a hot water tank, in which the bathers wash themselves after being shaved and rub bed. This tank has no waste pipe below: it is always replenished from above, and the superfluous water overflows its stone edges. The tank is seldom, If ever, completely emptied. The result is that it is often ankle- deep in epithelial debris and other filth from the bodies of the many bathers. As the baths are public and are visited by people of all classes, regardless of the fact that many of them are suffering from diseases of various kinds, these tanks become fruitful sources of*the dissem ination of disease, especially those of the skin and eyes, and perhaps also syphilis. The inhabitants of those villages which do not possess public baths, with few exceptions, rarely wash their bodies, and seldom take off their clothes. They therefore suffer less from these diseases. A Persian family generally lives in the uppe' storey of its house, which is approached by a flight of steps from outside Ha ita ions.. leading on to the verandah. These upper rooms face the central courtyard and open to the verandah by several doors or large windows, which often occupy neaily the whole front of the room. The doors and windows are ill-constructed and usually of unseasoned wood which readily warp^ : the crevices and chinks thus formed admit large currents of air. The only remedy for this is to hermetically seal the windows. Such rooms can never be kept properly warm in winter, for even if the windows be sealed up, the doors cannot be treated in the same way, and the inmates are generally too indolent to take any real trouble in the matter. They are unable therefore to keep out the extreme cold of winter, and lung complaints in the cold season are very common. The common custom in Persian houses is to place a square, low table, not more than a foot high, in the centre of the room, and underneath this a brazier of live charcoal: over the table are spread large, wadded quilt: (razais or lihdfs), which extend to some distance from the edges of the tabl* 48 I. B - 3 X530 MES—MES the inmates seat themselves round this table, cover themselves with the quilts and place their feet under the table close to the brazier. In this way they pass their leisure time, smoking, drinking tea, etc., while the draughts play about their shoulders. At night time they place cushions for their heads and sleep with the same arrangement. Those who can afford it sometimes have a fire in addition, burning in an open fire-place : this warms the room better, but strengthens the draughts. Owing also to the comparatively thin walls, with the large space occupied by doors and windows, as well as the defects noted above in the construc tion of these houses, it is not possible to keep them properly cool in the heat of summer. To avoid this discomfort, many prosperous Persians have underground rooms called zlr-i-zaminl, to which they resort when the weather is unpleasantly hot. The basements of the Persian houses are used by the servants and for kitchens and godowns, and are damp and more unhealthy than the rooms above. In the poor quarters, several families may occupy a single house such as is described above, or often there are basements only, the houses being sing’e storeyed : in such cases too the rooms are frequently below the level of the street and have a door, but no window beyond a hole in the wall which perhaps cannot be closed or blocked up as there is no other exit for the smoke of the fire or the fumes of the chamoal. Arrangements alluded to under this head are usually very insanitary, and violate most of the elementary principles Conservancy. . . . j z r of hygiene. The latrines are holes in the ground, which lead, by a sloping shoot, to a pit about 12 to 20 feet deep. When the pits are full, the sewage is removed with rope and bucket, or dug out and carried away for manure. It may, however, be deposited somewhere in the lane or street or on some open space, and so cause inconvenience, if nothing worse. In poor people’s houses, the pits often are not emptied for long periods and a e allowed to overflow : the sewage then sinks into the ground around and makes the place exceedingly foul. When it is remembered that in many cases the water-supply for the house is drawn from a well which is sunk within a few feet of this cess-pit, the whole horror of the situation becomes apparent. In some cases the water for daily use is taken from a tank or hauz in the middle of the courtyard, which is common to a great many houses : this, however, is replenished f om some external source by mean &gt; of a channel which may run past and in actual contact with the rotten and undermined wall of he privy, and over the ground covering the cess-pit. Among the pious Shi’ahs of Eersia a custom prevails of desiring their t.. surviving relatives to convey their bodies, on Disposal of the dead. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Qf Meshed or Karbala for interment. In the fulfilment of this custom, large numbers of co 'pses are yearly brought into Meshed sometimes from very long dis tances and in various stages of decomposition, to be taken mto the shrine and carried round the tomb of the saint, before being decently bured inone of the numerous cemeteries in the heart of the city or in the ‘ ‘ Biast.” This custom is rigidly adhered to even in times of epidemic sickness, such as small-pox and cholera, regardless of the probably evil consequences to the inhabitants of the town, who hemseives abet and approve the sacred rite. In this way, the cemeteries of Meshed have been filled over and over again with the dead of generations. These cemeteries abound with rats, which establish underground communications between the graveyards and the neighbouring houses. In the event of plague in a severe form, such as is now epidemic in India, reaching Meshed* the city would probably fare very badly. The public slaughter houses are situated about 50 yards outside the , , . city walls, on the road leading from the Idgah Slaughter houses. p -j n K H - hSn Gate . S The many l arge pariah dogs, which are the indispensable scavengers of the town, attend to the disposal of the slaughterman’s refuse. In spite, however, of their a sistance, the ne ; ghbourhood of these houses is usually very unsavoury, so that they constitute a public nuisance. In addit on to these public buildings, nearly every soHliers’ guard house in the city is a private slaughter house, as the ill-paid and worse- clad Pers'an so 1 dier often ekes out a precarious livelihood by keeping sheep, and in due time killing them and seliing the meat. These slaughter-houses are used ch'efly fo the killing of sheep, as the butchers deal almost exclusively in mutton, oo supp y. Only the very poor eat beef, which is usually obtained from the slaughtered carcases of diseased cattle or camels, and is hardly fit for consumption. Good beef is rarely obtainable, and then only by special arrangement with the butcher. Game of various kinds, i.e., wild sheep and venison, bustard, duck, partridge, sand-grouse, etc., is plentiful at most seasons of the year, and exposed for sale in the bazars, as are also turkeys and fowls. Public milk-sellers are numerous. The milk is generally slowly simmered in a large cauldron in the shop front, for the separation of the cream, and the skimmed milk then sold. This is frequently fraudulently diluted with water, generally the nearest water available, which is often unfit for use. The dangers lurking in bazar milk are therefore great. In the same way, contaminated water is often used for mixing the dough in the making of the bread sold in the baker’s shops, and as the heat used in the baking of the Persian bread may not be sufficiently great to destroy the germs of disease encased in the centre of the dough, this staple article of diet is also not free from danger. There is no properly constituted sanitary authority- in Meshed. There is, however, a native physician, on whom the Sanitary Inspector. gM h has bestowed the title of “ President of Physicians ” ; it is his function to attempt to improve the hygienic con ditions under which the people of the city live. Beyond making per functory inspections and recommending measures, which he has no power to enforce or money to carry out, he can do nothing. 3 X2532 MES—MES Considering the very insanitary conditions prevailing in this town, General health which are worse than in most oriental cities on account of the peculiar customs connected with the disposal of the dead, the general health of the inhabitants is surpris ingly good. It is impossible, owing to the absence of statistics, to form any reliable estimate of the average mortality, but it is believed to be not very high. Occasionally severe epidemics break out, such as cholera, brought by pilgrims from some other part of the country, but they die out again and do not remain endemic. In 1868, 1892, and in 1904, severe epidemics, and in 1893 a mild epidemic Common diseases. of cholera ’ visited the city but between these years it was free from this disease. The epidemic of 1892 is estimated to have carried off considerably more than 5,000 victims ; that of 1893 did not spread and carried off only 125 persons ; but the scourge of 1904 literally decimated the town, for out of a population of about 80,000 it destroyed not less than 8,000. Plague outbreaks have occurred at • intervals in Khorasan and Meshed during the past two hundred years. There wSre restricted epidemics of this nature in the province and in . the neighbourhood of Meshed in the years 1831, 1876, 1877, 1881, 1882, and 1887. This last occurred in a village about 20 miles from the city. Small-pox is probably always in Meshed, and occasionally there are wide spread epidemics in the town. Small-pox inoculation as a preventive is commonly practised among the natives, but vaccination with calf-lymph is known only to the better classes and practised only by the European physicians. Influenza visited the city in December 1889, and again in October 1891, at the same time that the disease was over-running Europe. Mild epidemics appear to recur at intervals, and probably the disease is always present in the town. , : Measles, whooping-cough and mumps are common every year, often in the spring. Severe outbreaks of “epidemic sore throat” occasionally visit the city and neighbourhood. It appears to be the “ internal erysipelas, ” or, angina, which is now seldom seen in England. It is never accompanied by ‘‘ false membrane.” It spreads rapidly and causes a high mortality, particularly in the early period of the epidemic. It is said to have first nvaded Khorasan in 1884, having come from Kirman. In the year 1889, Kuchan was so severely ravaged by the disease that the whole population left the town. Diphtheria breaks out sometimes in epidemic form. A recent outbreak at lurbat-i-Shaikh Jam was at first reported by the local authorities to be plague ! Malignant pustule sometimes occurs, but the attacks are confined to the workers in raw wool. Although met with in this class of worker in Meshed, it is more frequent among the wool-workers near the Afghan frontier. These people understand perfectly the value of active cauteri zation of the pustule which they effect by making a paste of wet gun powder, applying it to tne affected area and then setting light to it.There are always cases of typhoid fever in the city. This is sometimes confounded by the native physicians with a severe type of remittent lever which prevails in the summer and autumn months, and which is also sometimes fatal. These ‘ 4 hakims ’ ’ always speak of enteric fever as “typhus fever.” Malaria is a very common disease. It is usually of the intermittent type, quotidian, tertian, or quartan, and is prevalent mostly in the spring and autumn months ; it is as a rule more severe in the autumn. In addi tion, a severe type of remittent fever, referred to above, is met with in the summer and autumn. Affections of the alimentary tract are far more common than any other class of disease. This, no doubt, is mainly due to the impure water used for cooking and drinking, which is also used as a diluent for the milk sold in the bazar, combined with the wide-spread Persian habit of excessive tea-drinking. This tea is made as a decoction, by being boiled in the tea-pot over the samovar, rather than as an infusion, and so contains a maximum of deleterious matter. Owing to the great indifference as to the quality of the water used for drinking, troubles caused by intestinal parasites are exceedingly common : round and thread worms are met with in a very large proportion of the patients who come to the hospitals, and also, in a slightly less degree, tapeworm. Organic disease of the heart is not common ; functional troubles, how ever, are very frequent, among upper class Persians. These are gen erally due to the addiction of this class of Persian to various habits of a harmful nature such as “vodka” drinking, heavy-tea-drinking, exces sive cigarette-smoking and opium-smoking and eating. More than one, and often all, of these habits are found combined in the same person, with the result now under discussion. Affections of the lungs and respiratory tract are very common, parti cularly among the very young and the old. The faulty construction of the houses is largely responsible for this. Acute Bright’s disease of a severe type is met with. Venereal diseases are extremely common. Syphilis is said to assume a more virulent form in Barbaris than in other classes of the community. No precautions are taken against those suffering from syphilis, so that cases of accidental inoculation are not infrequent. Skin diseases, mainly those due to dirt and parasitic invasion, are wide spread. A granuloma, apparently identical with the “Baghdad boil” and “ Frontier sore,” is to be seen everywhere on the faces or hands of children, and the scars of the same on the skin of adults. Eye diseases are mostly those due to syphilis, more common still, affections of the lids and external parts of the eye, such as trachoma and ordinary ophthalmia with their sequelae, caused by dirt and neglect or the sequelae of small-pox. Both these and affections of the skin are doubtless disseminated to a great extent by the foul conditions obtaining in the public baths. Cataract is met with in both young and old, and is not rare. Tuberculosis in its various forms is widespread.34 MES—ME8 Phthisis is a very common disease in the city, as are also tuberculous anections of glands, bones and joints. Many cases of stone in the bladder present themselves for treatment in the British hospital, but most of them come not from Meshed, but from the outlying villages and from the Afghan frontier. b Tnere is at work in Meshed a most potent agent destroying the general Drug habits. health and physique of the people, namely, the , abuse of opium, which in Persia is rarely used m moderation, almost always in excess. In many cases the consumption of the drug has been begun at the instance of the “ hakim” or a friend to relieve pain, often of dyspepsia, and the user has fallen a victim to the habit. In other cases no such excuse exists. The amount consumed varies with the means and leisure of the victim, and sometimes the quantity is enormous. The vice is widely spread among women as well as among men, and even children are addicted to it. Where possible the drug is smoked ; but when there is not sufficient leisure for this^ it is eaten m the form of pills. Most Persians agree in condemning the' habit, and its prevalence constitutes a national disease of the gravest kind, the evil effects of which are undermining the vitality of the people. It is C x 1 ?T PU , ted , tha ^ P rob _ a bly more than one-third of the total fixed population of Meshed is tariaqi” namely, “addicted to the opium habit.” mong the richer classes spirit-drinking is also very prevalent. Usually it is the Russian vodka ” which is consumed, but when this is not at hand, a native spirit, known simply as “araq,' ’ is used instead. Brandy is also highly prized; during a time of cholera scare a bottle of brandy will command a fabulous price. The mullds, the spiritual guides and teachers of the people, are often the worst offenders in the matter of opium and spirit co isumption. Hospitals and dispensaries. I here are four public charitable dispensaries in Meshed 1. the British Consulate-General dispensary; 2- the Russian Consulate-General dispensary ; 3. the Russian Bank dispensary; and 4. the Shrine Dispensary. Of these four, only the British and the Shrine dispensaries have any suitable accommodation for in-patients, and these two are generally known clS II OSpiLcllS. There are four leading druggists’ shops which undertake the dispensing of prescriptions, but as the dispensers understand only the native physi cians methods of prescribing, they are not of much use to European doctors. r A large number of small dealers also keep European drugs, of which they know the names, and have some vague idea of the uses to which they are genera, y put &gt; on this slender basis they boldly undertake to diagnose and treat with medicine the ailments of those who are ignorant enough to app y to them. ® T i Th f Shiane . hos P ltal has a »taff of about five or six native physicians. The hospital is nearly always full, and some kinds of surgical operationsare undertaken, but not often with satisfactory results. This hospital is used mostly by pilgrims. The Russian Consulate dispensary has a daily attendance of about 40 to 50 out-patients in the summer : in the winter it is less. When the Russian Consular Medical Officer has finished his duties at the Consular dispensary, he proceeds to the Bank dispensary, wheie he sees all the male patients. The female patients are seen by a Russian^lady doctor, the wife of one of the bank employes. The average attendance here in the summer is about 70, and less in winter. This dispensary was established as a “ draw ” for the Russian Banque d’Escompte de Peise. The British Consulate-General hospital is the only one in the city which is equipped for the reception and scientific treatment of in-patients, and for the undertaking of serious surgical work. It has recen ly been largely repaired, renovated and altered ; also a good deal of modern equipment has been added, an operating room fitted out and an ophthalmoscopic “ darkroom.” ' The average daily attendance of out-patients throughout the year is 112. During the year 1904 to 1905, before the renovations and re-equipment were completed, 41 major operations and a large number of minor operations were performed. Eve operations have hitherto formed the large propor tion of the major operations. About 36,000 patients are seen annually. As the principal city of Khorasan, Meshed bears the largest share of the trade and acts as a distributing centre for Commerce. the province. As, however, the statistics are compiled for the province as a whole, a detailed statemnt falls more pro perly under the heading of Khorasan.

During the last decade, however, Russia has with success made strenuous efforts to increase her lead : nor can this success be considered in any way extraordinary, for even given equal fiscal conditions, the proximity to the Khorasan frontier of the Central Asian Railway, now supplemented by the Tashkent-Orenburg line, contrasted with the long and expensive routes by which British and Indian goods must necessarily be conveyed, gives Russia, frirnd facie, an incalculable advantage. Secondly, north Persia is able to supply Russia wuth many articles which are too bulky to repay transport to India (e.g., dried fruits, rice, cotton and wool) in return for Russian goods ; hence exports to Russia to some extent approximate to imports, wdiereas imports from India very con siderably exceed the exports. Apart from the broader issues involved, the Indian merchant must thus frequently pay the hire of his transport both ways for a single freight. Thirdly, fiscal conditions are by no means equal, owing to the artificial stimulus applied by Russia’s very favourable tariff for exports from Persia. There are, however, certain commodities, e.g., tea, indigo, and spices in which Indian trade should always maintain a monopoly, while surren dering to Russia those goods, in the supply of which the latter’s favour able geographical and fiscal position defies successful competition. The principal industries practised in the city are :— Carpet-weaving. Four hundred frames exist in Meshed itself. The products are mainly exported via Batum to Cons tantinople. Shawl-weaving. Sixty to seventy frames. Also exported to Constantinople for country use. Neither carpets nor shawls can compare with the exquisite fabrics produced in Kirn an. Silk-weaving. The number of frames has fallen from 700 to 150 or 200. The articles produced are somewhat rough and crude in colour. The larger trade is with India, but a small amount is still exported to the Caucasus. Stone-working. Close to Meshed a very soft, greyish stone is quar ried. The greater portion of this is used for tomb-stones and for building purposes, but there is also a distinctly artistic manu facture of vases, jars and stands of this material, on which various designs are incised. Other industries are designed to supply the wants of the • inhabitants and not for export. In 1891, a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia was established at Meshed, Banks and commercial the normal establishment consisting of three houses. Europeans and a subordinate Persian staff. Subsequently, the Russian Banque d’Escompte de Perse, a branrh of the Russian State Bank, commenced operations. The staff now consists Industries. ( 1 ) ( 2 ) (3) (4)MES—MES 539 3 Y 2 of some 30 Russian emplo} T es, and the operations of the Bank are conduct- g(j more with a view to eventual political and financial influence than to immediate commercial success. A characteristic of its business is the granting of loans to influential native customers on exceptionally favour able terms and slender security. Russian trade in Khorasan is chiefly by two companies, both of which advance money to merchants at 8 per cent, on goods carried by their firms Of these the principal is the Bureau de Transport de Perse which acta for the Kavkaz and Merkuri Company, the Russian Transport Company and the Oriental Transpo t Company. The affairs of this Bureau are in a flourishing condition. The second company, the Nejejde, is from all accounts doing but little business at the present time. Messrs. Nobel and Company have recently built and stocked a warehouse for petroleum. A list of the principal Persian and Afghan merchants trading at Meshed is given below :— (1) Hap ’Abdul Husain, Tehran!. Exports opium to India and imports piece-goods to a small extent. (2) Aqa Raza, Rais-ut-Tupar. Joint lessee with the Mu’avin-ut- Tujjar in the working of the Nishapur turquoise mines, and a large landed proprietor. (3) Haji Muhammad Bagha Razaiev. Trading in waste silk, tea, and rice with a small carpet trade to Tiflis. (4) Hap Abdul Husain Zavaar. (5) Hap Mirza Muhammad Karbassi. A Yazd merchant trading in opium with Bombay. (6) Haji Muhammad Kazim Yazdi, Rukn-ut-Tujjar. Imports tea from India and goods from Yazd, and is a large landed proprie tor. (7) Haji Abdul Ghassim Tehranchi, Mughazeh. Owns shops and bazars in various places. (8) Haji Muhammed Taqi Darudi. A large sugar importer. There are three Afghan brothers, Haji Muhammad Hasan, Mu’avin-ut- Tujjar, Haji’Ali Akbar, and Haji Abdurrahim, g an angers are general bankers to the Government officials and merchants. They own much land and house property and a share in the working of the Nishapur mines. A telephonic installation in the city has been commenced on the initia tive of a native firm, and the scheme seems to have a fair prospect of success. Agricultural produce from the surrounding district is sufficient for the needs of the city. Wheat and barley are the Produce and supplies. principal cereals grown, and chaff, or kah, and lucerne are used for fodder.Vegetables, consisting ot potatoes, turnips, carrots, onions, beet r oot and spinach, are grown and consumed in large quantities by the inhabi tants. Fruit is excellent in quality and abundant : grapes, melons, peaches apricota, apples, and pears being ihe chief varieties. Strawberiers repay cultivation, and most European vegetables thrive. Fuel is sufficient for the needs of the city and is brought from the sur rounding hills and from the Jagharq valley. In common with the rest of Persia, the denudation of the country of its wood for fuel is a question which may become serious in future years. It is perhaps worth noting that in such items as fuel and forage, a con siderable saving can be effected by purchasing at a favourable time and storing for the winter. As prices for all country products vary considerably with the season, the highest and lowest rates prevailing at present in a normal year have been given. With the exception of petroleum, sugar, tea, Eussian vodka and light wines, European stores and liquors cannot be procured at Meshed. Summer. Per Winter. Per Price. Price. T. K. S. T. K. S.

MESHED (No. 2) (District)— A district of Khorasan, which extends from the city of Meshed north- Area west up the valley as far as Saiyich h, about 60 miles ; south, to the Turbat-i-Haidari border about 40 miles ; west, to the watershed of the Binalud range, 20 miles ; east, to the Hari Rud about 100 miles; north-east, to Kalat 60 m les. An area of 6,000 to 7,000 square miles, of which 2,000 may be set down as level valley or p 1 ateau land, more or less cultivable when there are facilities of water. The remaining area includes high mountain ranges, rising to 8,000 or 9,000 feet, and showing but few cultivable spots and scanty herbage for cattle. Though, owing to the cessation of the Turkoman raids and maintenance of peace, the district has considerably recovered, and a large number of new villages have been built, and old irrigation channels repaired during the last 20 years, the whole of the cultivable tract has not yet been brought under cultivation. The finest villages lie along the Kashaf Rud and hidden in the barren y.,, ravines of the Mihrabad and Kalat ranges, where small perennial streams support a luxuriant growth of garden and vineyards, but little or no corn land. In Jagharq, the finest example of these “ garden ” villages, the grain ra sed is actually by about half insufficient for the population of the village. The villages on the Kalat or northern range are in this respect in a slightly better situation ; for the hill slopes are there less steep and rocky, and yield grain crops dependent on rainfall only. From Meshed to Herat the road is too well known to call for remark. It is practicable for wheeled carriage. The valley of the Kashaf Rud from Chinaran to Meshed forms the sub- Valley of the Kashaf district Mian-i-Vilaiat, while the country south-east Rud, Mian Vilaiat of Meshed is called Pain-i-Vilaiat (middle and and Pain Vilaiat. lower country); many of the villages of the Mian-i- Vilalat sub-district are inhabited by the Kaivanlu Kurds.544 MES—MES For description of each, see article on each buluk.

On the above buluks, six may be set down as capacity for supply of not even produce enough for their own neces* sities ; and it is unlikely that an invader would be able, under any circum stances, to get at their small stores, or at those of the peasantry generally. From the remaining 13 buluks a grain rent, amounting in all to 8,700 kharwdrs or about 2,500 tons, is taken, though the whole of this amount is at present used up in the maintenance of the royaf troops and func* tionaries of the Government , assignment holders, and khans, with their swarms of followers, the urban population and pilgrims, etc., and there isMES-MES 545 hardly any surplus from local consumption ; but a force having command of the resources of the district might insist upon the whole of that quantity being delivered in kind at harvest time and utilize it for its own purpose. For information regarding the resources of Meshed and its surrounding districts and the amounts available after local consumption, attention is invited to the article under Khorasan. Save in Umited areas in the mountains, no grains are cultivated or cut for forage in any part of Khorasan. In the ® rain * moist hollows in the eastern part of Sar-i-Jam, and the wide plain at the head of the Meshed valley about Chinaran and Radkan, there are pastures, on which large numbers of cattle and horses would find grazing at certain seasons,—in spring and after the autumn rain. Horses are fed on chopped straw, wheat, or barley, mixed at times with dry lucerne, of which limited quantities only are raised. No very large supply of any of these could be calculated on in the vicinity of Meshed itself. In a country the soil of which grows nothing spontaneously, save thistles, wood is naturally scarce and dear. Firewoo . The villages on the hillskirts furnish a limited supply, grown for the market and cut down periodically when of the requisite thickness. The supply of firewood near Meshed is being gradually exhausted : every year the purveyors of firewood go further afield. Juniper wood is brought in from as distant places as the Mazdaran hills, while pistachio is brought from the hill slopes near Pas Kamar. The villages in the hills to the north-west of Meshed still supply most of the ordinary firewood used. The mountains to the north, at a distance of 20 to 30 miles over the most impracticable roads, produce a stunted growth of juniper, the supply of which is at present only limited by the cost of carriage. Water is everywhere scarce, and often brackish, though not unwhole- Water su 1 some. The Kashaf Rud is brackish below a ' Meshed, as also are many of its feeders from the mountain. Along the main line of the valley, however, qandts and springs are so numerous that the largest force collected there would suffer no inconvenience. At Meshed itself there are numerous qandts, and the water rises freely in the wells, which are usually sunk to a depth of from 24 to 30 feet. The soil is alluvial to a depth of about 20 feet, consisting of small gravel and compact layers of coarse sand, underlying which is a bed of stiff clay. The new military scheme has taken troops quartered in districts from Forceg control of Governors. A special commandant— termed the Sdldr-i-Mukarram —has been ap pointed, who receives orders direct from the Ndib-us-Sultaneh (the Minister of War at Tehran). The Governor-General has, however, for defence purposes a more or less powerful instrument in the armed population, which should, in time of need, be ready to his hand. Garrisons : —At Kalat- i-Nadiri, about 100 Infantry men; at Sarakhs, a few Aitilleiymen only. About one-third of the estimated rural population may be reckoned as the number of able-bodied males ; the proportion of adults having been 48 LB. S Z646 MES -MES much raised by the famine, which in many places swept off the : entire infant population. It is estimated that the district suffered the loss of half of its people, chiefly of the nomadic portion—its best fighting element. . The total population of the city and district together is about 180,000 or , 190,000. The Kalat range, on the north of the district, is peopled by tribes for ij! r itj eg most part of Turk origin. The upper part of the valley or plain and the mountains bordering it north and south are held by Kurds, a portion of 100,000 ■ families said to have been transported from Kurdistan by Shah ’Abbas Safavi. The mountaineers of the Mihrabad range on the south are chiefly ’Ajams. In the plain about Meshed to the north-east and south the village popula tion is much mixed, but the ’Ajam element predominates. There are also Kurds and Turks of various tribes, and some ’Amaqs, Hazaras, and Jamshidis. The nomads are chiefly of the latter tribes. The tribes are estimated at the following strength :— Timuris .. .. .. .. 7,500 families. Barbaris .. ... .. .. 4,000 „ Hazaras .. .. .. .. 2,500 „ The village population, though not contented subjects, being connected by ties of religion and association with their Government, and also having much to fear from the presence in their country of an invading army, may be assumed to be at the disposal of the Government for purposes of defence ; and the same may be said of the nomads of Turk origin. The few thousand ’Amaqs, Hazaras, Jamshidis, and Timuiis are chiefly Sunnis. Their adherence to the Persians in times of trouble would be very precarious ; many of them, and those of the leading men, are in constant communication with Herat. Every town and village in the district is provided with defences of some Defences. sort ’ t ^ lese usua % consist of a long thin curtain wall of mud, with short circular projec tions for flanking defence—useless, save for shelter from musketry fire. Many of the villages, especially to the north of Meshed, have a high, raised mound popularly known as the sites of the ‘ atisMadehs,' or fire-temples— * J ai g e enough and high enough to form a most efficient cavalier, and almost indestructible by direct fire. Many of them have strong cells or chambers, that would serve as casemates. Such positions, improved and combined with somew hat better temporary outer lines of defence, would prove formid able obstacles to a force followed by light guns only. The defences of the towns and villages are, however, rapidly falling into disrepair: now, many new villages are being built with no pretence at defences. This is of course owing to the much greater security prevailing, and the knowledge that ordi nary walls would be^ of no use against the artillery that would be sent against them from Meshed in case of any serious resistance to authority. The de fences of Meshed itself are more formidable in appearance and less so in reality than those of the meanest villages in the vicinity ; for they areof great extent and the weakest possible construction (for description see article on Meshed City.— (Na'pier ; Maula Bakhsh ; Redl, 1906 ; Smyth, 1906.) MESHED-BIRJAND (District)— Between Meshed and Birjand The general features of the whole country are a succession of bare and rocky mountain ranges running north-east and south-west, enclosing long, narrow valleys, for the most part destitute of rivers, and dependent for • their cultivation on karizes and insignificant mountain streams. Both mountains and valleys are absolutely bare of trees, except where ‘ cultivated ; in places there is a low scrub jungle fit for firewood, and every- r where camel grazing is to be found. In the spring a scanty and short lived grass appears, and fattens large flocks of sheep, some of which exist duting the remainder of the year on the low heather-like plants that cover the ground, while the majority wander elsewhere in search of better pastures. Horses, mules, and cattle are fed on chopped straw and dried lucerne vetches, twisted into ropes and stored. South of the Meshed valley, down which flows the Kashaf Bud, and near » the town of Meshed, beyond Turuq, the offshoots from the lofty Nishapur range form an undulating stretch of downs. Further to the east are low hills. These merge into the Qad-i-Shamshir range, some 7,000 feet in altitude, Meshed itself being about’3,100 feet. This range forms the watershed between the Jam and Kashaf Rud streams which, flowing in a south-easterly and easterly direction, respectively, empty themselves into the Hari Rud. The Jam is quite a small stream, being only about 20 feet broad and from one to two feet deep, near where it joins the Hari Rud, which forms the Afghan boundary from about the latitude of Kariz north wards. The Jam valley, about 15 miles broad, is bounded on the south west by another range, of which the most prominent point is the Kuh-i- Bizak, 9,330 feet, the southern limit of the range. This is a conspicuous landmark, overlooking a barren and almost uninhabited waste that slopes down from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam to the plain of Hashtadan and the frontier of Afghanis La- To the north-west tne range breaks up into two branches : the Kuh-i- , Muhammad Mirza and the Kuh-i-Baidar. South of these is the plain of ' Turbat-i-Haidari. The western portion of this tableland drains into the Kavir. The almost dry river-bed, on the left bank of which is situated the town of Turbat-i-Haidari, takes a southerly course and joins the Shur Rud or salt river, which flows into the Namaksar, a large salt lake south of Hashtadan. Four or five miles to the south-east of Turbat-i-Haidari, low Jiills lead up to the Bakharz range, which runs parallel to that of the Kuh- i-Bizak, enclosing the Bakharz valley, 12 miles in breadth, and separating it from khaf. Khaf is bounded on the south by the Kuh-i-Khaibar and tho Namaksar, on the east by Hashtadan and the undefined Afghan boundary, and on the west by the barren plain stretching from Turbat-i-Haidari to the Khaibar Kuh.. West of this again lies the fertile valley of Gunabad, situ ated in the re-entrant angle of the range that stretches across from the 3 Z 2.MES—MES 549 » KdMte be ili] minim jj raquiiili : tbaillK, mW ud i til toioW' iw ;be *M , ® ud nil* HU MESHED-I-BUZAM— Elev . 3,700'.

The present houses are built just outside the ruined gateway and walls of a former town, said to have been built by Nadir and subsequently des- troyed by an earthquake. The village lies in the centre of a long, shallow, uplandvalley, known as the Julgah-i-Kular covered with grass, afiordmg eX The horizon on the north is bounded by the Tagharan range, and to the south lies the parallel Bash Tappeh range. Both of these ranges can be, ridden over anywhere and are covered with grass and small junipers, rocks only crop up occasionally.

Meshed, the adjoining village, contains some 180 houses and has two qanats and 25 ploughs. The two villages together are gene rally known as Meshed i-Riza, from the shrine and mausoleum of Shahzadeh Qasim, a descendant of Abu Bakr, who is said by tradition to have been murdered, while conducting prayers, by an unbeliever. The shrine, how ever, is now in ruins, and there seems to be nobody to look after it. The only man found there was a Kandahari faqir. — {0. E. Yate, 1894; {Watson, 1908.) MESHED QULl— A-village 8 miles from Meshed on the road to Kachan.—(Scfondkr.) ,,in ruins, but through the liberality of the Shahab-ul-Mulk, Governor- General of Khorasan, a new yakka caravanserai sufficient to shelter 2,000 men and beasts has been built—a very defensible and solid building that could not be taken without artillery, if properly defended. The population of the village annexed to this caravanserai is also increasing and freely cultivating the land near the serai. Water is got from a reservoir outside the serai. Supplies are very scanty. Close on the left of the serai is a small walled village, square, with bastions at the angles, containing about three houses, and with about 30 inhabitants. It is surrounded by a wall and dry ditch on three sides, the fourth being connected with the caravanserai. This fort is garrisoned by about 40 or 50 matchlock-men, who receiva the unusually good pay of 100 tumdns (about £20) a year. Tin water is small in quantity and bad. There is very little cultivation. The two or three gardens, which the inhabitants have, are at the foot of some mountains two hours, distant, where there is a small stream. These gardens are not sufficient to supply the wants of these few families, who purchase their barley and straw and other supplies from Maiamai, and resell them at a large profit. Hay is to be found at some distance from the present buildings.— (Clerk ; Napier ; Khanikoff ; Bellew.) The ruins of the old Kaleh are at present called Bdgh-i-SJidh, and perhaps represent the station Kuhandiz of Arab authors. The present Kaleh was built by HajI Mirza Akasi, the Prime Minister of Muhammad Shah. It has 50 houses (or is supposed to have) of TTmuri ’Arabs from the Kalateh-i- ’Arab-u-’Ajam, 16 miles north-west of Miandasht. The o’d caravanserai of Mland&amp;sht dates from the time of Shah ’Abbas, and was repaired in A.H. 1291 by Eaji ’Ali Naki ; the new caravanserai was built by Husain Khan Nizam-ud-Dauieh at a cost of over £40,000. The village and the old and new caravanserai are enclosed by a wall, and altogether form a strong and very defensible building. In one of the courts are two cisterns, and outside the caravanserai is a large cistern with two ventilating towers. The accommodation in the caravanserais consists of 86 rooms with doors, 27 rooms open to the front, many passages and immense stables. Of the 50 families who are supposed to reside here, and receive pay from Government for that purpose, 30 are generally away in the Kalateh i- ’Arab-u-’Ajam. Miandasht has a post-house and a telegraph station of the Persian Government.— (Schindler.) MIANDEH— Lat. 34° 52' 30'; Long. 58° 38' 30'—(Walker). A village in Khorasan, so called from its position midway (midn) be tween Meshed and Tabas. It is the southern limit of the Turbat-i-Haidari district.

This is the most populous and well-cultivated tract in the whole district, having over 200 villages. It suffered much in the famine of 1870-72. The people are chiefly ’Ajam, Kurds, and Turks, with 1,000 tents of Timuri nomads. A large number of the villages belong to the shrine of Imam Riza. The estimated population of this buluk is 50,000. The Kashaf Bud, which takes its rise from the springs situated in the Radkan and Chinaran valley, flows in its upper part right through this buluk.

It is 80 feet high, built of burnt brick, and is of graceful proportions, with a sort of fitted plinth.— [MacGregor.) mIl-i-radkan— l wo miles from the present Radkan stands the tower known as Mil-i- Radkan. This is a brick building, some 50 paces in circumference and some 80 feet in height. The walls are some 7 or 8 feet in thickness, octagonal inside and circular outside. The plinth is about 8 feet in height, and above that the face of the structure consists of 36 semi circular pillars. At the top of these originally ran an inscription in Cufic characters inlaid with blue tiles, but this is utterly defaced now. Above this rises the conical top. The building is now entirely hollow, but a circular staircase originaly ran up one side of it inside the wall, and there were evidently interior floors and an inner dome. The building is visible from afar. The object of the tower is obscure. It was not intended for defence, as there are no loopholes or openings of any sort, except two doors opposite each other at the bottom As the tower is very lofty, and placed on rather high ground, it may have been intended for a look-out tower. Tradition points to this tower as a shooting lodge of one of the Turkoman kings of Persia. A similar tower, with a similar name, stands near the village of Radkan, on the road from Shahrud to Gaz, in the bay of Astarabad. It may fairly be presumed that the towers have given their names to the villages, and that som3 clue to their history may be traced in the name. ‘ Radkan ’ appears to be neither Turkish nor modern Persian ; it is probably some obsolete word indicating the purpose of the building.—(Va^er; C.

There are two gates to the iener wall—one on the south called Bala Darvazeh, and the other on the north called Pain Darvazeh ; they are connected by a street, with trees down the centre, in which are the shops of the place. The former town seems to have occupieda space of 350 yards by 400, and to have been enclosed within a good wall, with towers at the corners and at every 50 yards in the curtain ; and these fortifications still remain. Probably, owing to increase of population, a further space of 50 yards all round has been enclosed ; and the north side is surrounded by an ordinary wall and a good, broad ditch. In the north west corner of this area is a mound of the height of about 40 feet, looking into the citadel, which is simply a portion of the village, 100 yards square, marked off. The regularity of the streets in Muhammadabad is remarkable. They are laid out at right angles to the walls, and have two main streets, which meet in the centre, coming from the four points of the compass. A large number of gardens extend for a considerable distance north of the town. # r m i Muhammadabad has now a population of 1,000 families of Turks, who possess 1,100 cattle and 5,000 sheep and goats.

A village, milrtary post and pass, in Khorasan, 55 miles from Meshed, on the road to Sarakhs, from which it is about 50 miles distant. It has several watch-towers, with a nominal garrison of 50 Persian foot and 50 horse. It stands on an isolated spur of tableland on the descent from the Dar- Dand pass, in a position to protect the road into Persia. There is a beautiful fountain of tepid water, which springs up under Muzdaran, and makes for itself and some kindred streams a channel down the valley, where the remains of fruit trees and gardens may still be seen. The range which bears the same name stretches north-west and south-east. It is apparently quite inaccessible, except at Muzdaran itself, where the ridge becomes a little more rounded and less precipitous, and then affords room for two or three paths over it. These, as well as every crest and hollow of the ridge, are defended and blocked by high, circular towers. There are about 21 of these towers, besides the small fort on the crest of an isolated peak. Altogether it is a very strong position. The village contains 40 families of Persians, who possess 100 cattle, 1,000 sheep and goats, 60 horses and 40 camels. The annual production of wheat and barley is 4,500 and 3,600 Indian maunds respectively. There would be no great difficulties in making a railroad over the pass. There are springs of water at the base of the range on the Meshed side, and on the Sarakhs side are numerous springs of excellent water to the north west .—{MacLean ; Oranoffsky, 1894.)

Outside it, and commanding it from the south-west, is a good caravanserai, solidly constructed of burnt brick. The building is 65 yards square, the walls are about 23 feet high and 3 to 4 feet thick at the base. It has a masonry roof, 1 foot thick at its thinnest point Round the roof, which is 18 feet wide, runs a parapet as high as one’s waist. It is loop-holed at intervals of 4 feet. Water plentiful from five qandts and three springs. ... t • -a t. x j There seem to be about 200 acres of cultivation here, chiefly wheat and tobacco ; the latter goes to Tehran. There are a number of fruit trees and gardens about. Large numbers of pilgrims pass this way en route to Meshed. Transport. —Camels 60 ; asses 200. Supplies.— Cow 150 ; sheep 2,000. Fuel is plentiful and comes from the mountains to the west. There are four flour-mills worked by water. There are two crops annually, one of wheat and one of tobacco. The wheat crop was gathered at about the end of June. There are excellent camping-grounds to the north and west of this for a large force.—(Lawman, 1887.) NAIBAND— Elev. 3 , 4 : 00 '.-{Mohi-ud-Din.) A picturesque village of about 400 inhabitants ; it lies 130 miles from Biriand 176 miles from Kirman, on the western border of Khorasan. It is perched upon a crag and built in the form of a fort. Many of the houses have watch-towers, the position having been chosen entirely with a view to defence against the Baluchis. The inhabitants are gree from tax ation. It has a small spring of good water, but the amount of ground fit for cultivation is very small indeed. Small quantities of wheat and bar ey are grown ; but the principal product is dates. The chief resource of the people is selling provisions to the caravans, which pass through ; pilgrims from Kirman going via Tun to Meshed, and merchandise going from Yazdand Kirman to Birjand and Herat. The people of Naiband act as guides to these caravans across the desert. Supplies, fuel and forage here are procurable, but at high rates. There is a warm spring about f mile away which does duty as a hdmmdm. J The hamlet of Zlarat Gah adjoins it. Through Naiband routes pass as follows, and this constitutes its importance,—from Herat to Kirman vid Birjand , Herat to Yazd via Birjand; Farah to Kirman and also Yazd vid Birjand ; Meshed to Kirman vid Tun ; Kirman to Astarabad vid Shah- rud. There are three marches of desert between Naiband and Khur. Occasionally the date crop fails, as it did in 1881, when 2,000 date-palms were killed and others damaged by a heavy fall of snow. —(Stewart’ Mohi-ud-Din ; Baggaley,1909.)

Up to about 1730 it was inhabited by some Iskandari ’Arabs and was an unimportant place. ’All Quli Khan of the Tamrtash tribe, a branch of the Shadillfi tribe, then left Bujnurd and settled here, building a fort with eight towers. His descendant Muhammad Hasan Khan later on built another fort with five towers, and Afr&amp;siab Khan, grandson of Muhammad Hasan Khan, is the present governor of Nardin. The little town* which has 300 houses and two mosques, suffered somewhat in consequence of a severe earthquake which happened on 31st March 1883. Many houses are infested with poisonous bugs. North-east of the town on the Kuh-i-Danial stands a small building called the Bukka-i-Danial, and a little less than a mile beyond this building is an old burial ground in which many grave stones have the shape of a trefoil, resembling the clubs of playing cards. The resources of Nardin are estimated as follows ;— Annual outturn of grain .. .. .. 2,000 kharwdrs. Transport available for hire; Camels .. 100 Mules and ponies ..

KALEH (No. 1) or NiRING KALEH— ..'' See “ Jajarm.” NARINJ KALEH (No. 2)— A ruined fort in Khorasan, near Ma'amai. Fraser, who visited this place, gives the following account of it: “ The top of the mountain consisted of a narrow ridge, with three principal risings of greater breadth. Two of these, the easternmost, had been crowned by forts, the stone walls of which were not only visible, but in some places remained still ten feet high. The westernmost embraced an area of from 50 to 60 square yards, the interior of which had been occupied by a number of small houses or chain-570 NAR—NAR bers, now all in total ruin. A round water tank, built of atone and plas tered inside, about 10 feet in diameter, and half filled with rubbish, had at one time no doubt afforded water to the inhabitants. The easternmost and principal fort was about 70 yards by 60 in area. I speak roughly, for the ground was too uneven to be paced. Its walls were about 5 feet thick, and the interior appeared to have been principally occupied by a bui’ding or series of buildings, consisting of seven chambers, 40 feet long by about 14 broad. Around these, between them and the walls, there was a space of some 50 feet, which on the south-east appears to have been vacant, but on the north-west was filled with smaller apartments of 20 feet by 8 or 10, all now quite ruinous. Here, too, was the principal tank, constructed of stone and cement and arched with burnt bricks, about 20 feet long by 10 broad, and having still a depth of 12 feet, clear of rubbish. “ The entrance to this fort was by a gate in the stone wall, arched with burnt bricks, and about 8 feet high under the centre of the arch. The bricks are formed of the scanty soil of the hill, which is partly calcareous and part ly argillaceous, and were burnt no doubt with the weeds and furze, which it produces. They are quite square and one-and-a-half inch thick, and the kiln in which they were burnt is still visible, though I did not go to look at it. These two forts, which may be from 500 to 600 yards asunder, have been joined by two w T alls embracing the neck or bridge of the hill, enclosing a space which in some places is not above 20 yards broad and in no part above 60, but which appears to have been studded thickly with buildings, all small, like those in the western fort. The walls in some places are not more than 2| to 3 feet in thickness ; others have been founded upon the huge rocks of the mountain itself, and these have been of greater size. The masonry work is far from good, and the cement throughout or clay. No dressed stone is to be seen. I cannot find that either money of antiques have been found here ; but there is plenty of broken pottery strewn about, and arrow heads of large size, both of iron and brass, have been picked up, much like those now in use among the Turkomans. Out- • side the walls may be seen the vestiges of what seem to have been graves formed much in the present . Muhammadan fashion with headstones, but very rude. I think this is all that can be said about this place, which is chiefly curious from its situation. That the ruins are of ancient date is not , to be doubted ; but to determine to what period its origin or existence should be assigned is probably impossible. In this dry climate stones remain for centuries unchanged in external appearance ; yet 1he stones.of these budd ings that have fallen are covered w.th yellow and grey lichens.’’-^-(Fraser) Narinj Kaleh is the common appellation for an inner citadel, a strong tower in a fort, etc.— [Schindler.)

NASlRlA (No. 2) (Town) or new KtJCHAN— On the complete destruction of old Kuchan by a severe earthquake at the beginning of 1895, it was decided to build a new town near Haihai, a village about 7£ miles east of the old town, and this place now forms the site of the new town, which is called Nas : ria or Shahr-i-Nasiria after the name of the present chief, Muhammad Nasir Khan, Shuja’-ud-DauIeh, and that of the late Nasir-ud-Din Shah by whom its construction was ordered. Most people, however, call it Kuchan-i-Nau or Kuchan-i-Jadid (new Ku chan), and have not got used to the name Nasiria. The new town has been laid out with great regularity. The streets and bazars are wide and straight, and shops and houses are being built rapidly. When completed the new town will present a very respectable appearance, and soon become a centre of trade, as the Meshed-Askhabad cart road, which formerly passed through the old town, has been diverted and made to pass through the new town. Armenian and Russian traders have taken up sites and built shops and offices, and the new town already boasts of a good odzdr, guest-house and caravanserai, a mosque and a public bath. Meshed traders and capitalists have also secured a large number of sites and are erecting shops and houses thereon. The Chief lives in the village of Haihai, which is now one of the environs of the new town, and proposes to build his citadel there. The majority of the population of the old town have removed to the new lown, but people who own vineyards and gardens at old Kuffian are likely to remain there.

NAUDEH (No. 6)— Lat. 37° 2' 0'; Long. 55° 17' 30' ; Elev. 300'.—[Napier.) A large village in the province of Astarabad, 50 miles east-nor’-east from Hie town of Astarabad. It is composed of three detached hamlets, com- prisbig in all 200 houses. The level ground in the valley is cleared and cU ,ely cultivated, but dense forest encircles the clearing, meeting above a d below it, and forming a most effectual barrier, behind which the vil- gers rest secure from any attack by their neighbours in the plain. They are line, active men, well armed, .and good foresters. Their houses are '* r * *• built of cane plaited into a timber frame, open in front and without fire place. The open front is closed at night by a curtain of split cane- work. No better shelter is, they say, necessary ; for the winter is short and mild. Snow falls, but lies for at most twenty-four hours. The summer is hot and unhealthy, malarial fever being very prevalent. The village is one of sixty-three villages of the Kuhsar-Fidarisk buluk, all lying on the flank of the Yamut Turkoman country. There are fifteen villages in the valley, all near enough to support each other and communicate either by gun shot or signal-fires. They can collect in from three to four hours 1,000 men, all armed with serviceable guns, and to a certain extent organis ed ; for they are paid a sum sufficient to enable them to keep up their equipment and supply of ammunition, and are accustomed to work to gether in parties of thirty to forty, as guards, escorts, etc. Knowing every path in the forest, and having great confidence in their own power to meet any enemy on their own ground, they would be formidable, even to a disciplined force. Naudeh grows rice and wheat and a little cotton. Of the first, large quantities are exported to Khorasan. The village pays a revenue of 200 kharwars of rice, the produce being in favourable years from six to eight times that amount. Wheat is more cultivated than formerly, and want of good roads and security alone prevent the increase of the production of cotton. The place is cut up by rivulets and dykes, utilised by the local population for irrigating their rice-fields. The whole country on each side is well watered and wooded, and is covered with pasturage. Petrusevitch draws attention to the pass and direct route from Naudeh through Mazaj to Maiamai. The road, passing up the Khurmali defile on a very gentle slope, emerges on the Zurdava plain, beyond which is Mazaj. In the bottom of the valley are extensive rice-fields. There are three openings leading to the Yamut plains. The southernmost passes by the village of Kundaz, the middle one is called Rah-i-Kaleh Tappeh, and the northern one Sadakanli. NAUDEH (No. 7) (Pass)— In the whole range of the Elburz, from Herat to the Tehran river, there is no point at which the chain could be so readily crossed, by either road or railroad, as on the line of the Naudeh valley. Up to the village of Tulbin the valley is open and the gradients easy. Thence a low. easy pass leads to the Naudeh plateau, from whence either Jajarm or Maiamai might be reached without crossing any difficult country. There is no other line affording anything like equal facilities. Coal has already been found in the mountains to the west. Water, fuel, and forage are here abundant, and some supplies.—(ReZfew; MacGregor] Petrusevitch', Napier.)

On a high, circular mound is a mud fort which contains the Khan’s residence, and commands the whole village Around are extensive orchards, groves, and vineyards, extending for two or three miles up and down the stream. The grapes of Naukhandan have a great local reputation, and very good wine is made and sold. Almost all the raisins are exported to AskhaLad, similarly with the peaches, which are plentiful. These are packed in baskets and despatched on donkeys across the hills to the Baba Durmaz railway station, ami thence railed m to Askhabad, where they sell from 1 to 3 krans {5d. to 14d.) per man _(6p).) according to the season. Large numbers of wild pig are said to invade the gardens every night from the hills to the north, and scare-crows are rigged up everywhere. The population consists of 100 families of Turks, who possess 800 cattle and 1 500 sheep and goats.

NIMATULEH— See Zlarat-i-Saiyid Ni’amatullah. NlMBULUK— A sub-division of the district of Kaln in Khorasan. It consists of a wide valley extending from north-west to south-east, some 35 miles long, 12 miles wide. On its surface to the northward are seen the villages of Salaiani, Mahiam, and Khizri. It is separated from Gunabad by a long, curving range of hills through which are several passes. The hill- range is called Maisur, and the passes from south to north are named Dehaneh-i-Gharqab, Mughri, Rijing, Balghur and Dehaneh-i-Sulaiman. The chief villages are Girimanj, Badun, Bashqabad, Qirish, Jamin, Bihud, Manavaj, Duduneh, Murdabad, Sihkurl, ’Allpalang, Dasht-i-Bazar, Aqa Jan, Asadabad, Naughab, and about 30 others. The range bounding the sub-division on the north is joined to the Kuh-i-Khaibar. The drain age of the valley goes to the Daqq-i-Dualan.Sabzawar. The southern part of the district as far as the Shur Rud is mostly salt steppe and salt desert (Kavir) ; the remainder of the district excepting the mountainous part is very fertile. The bed of the Shur Rud lies about 3,500 feet above the level of the sea, the town of Nishapfir 3,917 feet, while the villages at the foot of the mountains are from 200 to 400 feet higher. Some of the villages in the mountainous part of the dis trict are situated at an altitude of 5,500 feet or more. Number of kanzes 485. The climate of Nishapur is mild in winter and hot in summer, because the high mountains to the north keep off the Climate. cold Tlie rainfall is very small; snow seldom remains long on the ground. On the 14th March 1883, the snow on the mountains had melted up to a height of 7,000 feet, although the winter of 1882-83 had been exceptionally severe. The lowest tempera ture observed at Nishapur was 27° F., at Ma’dan 16° F. Most of the streams and rivers of the Nishapur district have their origin in the northern mountains, and nearly all their water is used for irrigation. It is only during spring when the snows melt that the waters of the streams go as far as south of Nishapur, and fill the bed of the Shur-rud ; this river runs first in a south-westerly direction, then, south of Sabzawar, turns a little to the north-west and flows towards the great central Persian depression, where it loses itself in the kavlr. The agricultural produce of the district consists principally of rice, millet, barley, wheat, and cotton (*). The vil- Agricultural produce. ^ of ^ plain grow much poppy for opium, but the opium does not contain much morphine. The castor oil plant is much cultivated for lamp-oil. Some villages have white mulberry tree plantations for the raising of silkworms, and nearly all villages have orchards of fruit trees—peaches, apricots, pomegranates, pistachios, plums and cherries. The vine also thrives well. On the mountains near Nishapur very fine rhubarb (Rheum rivas) is found ;_the rhubarb of Nishapur is said to be the best in Persia, and is much praised by the old historians; it is consumed as a vegetable cooked with meat, or as jam ; it is also much eaten in its raw state. Another wild plant used as a vegetable is the shulpa (Gundilia tournefontii), particularly in spring when it is tender and sweet; in winter it makes good fodder for cattle. Asafcetida grows on some mountain slopes, a few fig trees are also occasionally seen. The number of domestic animals in the district is estimated as follows Transport— Horses • * .. 2,658 Mules .. 1,638 Donkeys .. 13,083 Camels .. 4,500 (*) It is said that the soil of the Nishapur district is well suited for cotton growing, which pays better than cereals, and therefore the villagers are now taking to cotton-growing in preference to wheat. For some years .'‘past cotton cultivation has largely increased in the Nishapur district.—(fi - . M. Temple.)582 NTS—NTS Of other trees, willows, poplars and sanjid (Eloeagnus angustifolia) Trfceg exist in all gardens ; planes are rare ; a few pines at Qadamgah. In the mountains near Bar are old copper and lead mines ; near Abidin Mineralg and Karakuchi salt quarries; near Ma’dan are the celebrated turquoise mines; and in the Batau mountains an old, long since neglected, lead mine. „ . ,. The district has about 50,000* inhabitants, Population. i • n t&gt; • ^ chiefly Persians. A few nomads come every summer to Nishapur ; these are Baluchis and Timuris. The former settle down in the western, the latter in the eastern, part of the district. There are about 3,000 Baluchi families in Khorasan ; they were removed from Baluchistan in 1835. In the Darb-i- kazi sub-district, near the village Jilu, and in the Takan Kuh district near SluLab, have been living, since about 1839, some Afghan families. Government.

(1) Bar. —This sub-district is the northernmost of the Nishapur district. It has 15 Q any eh (villages) and several Mazra’eh (smaller villages, hamlets). The real village, Qariyeh, (Arabic for the Persian deh), has a kadkhudd (a kind of mayor) who is responsible for the mdlidt (revenues of the State). The Mazra’eh (literally a field under cultivation) belongs to the village, and its name is generally not inscribed in the registers of government, as it has * The revenue of the Nishapur district is said to be 60,000 tumans per annum, and Kevenue the population of the whole district.is estimated at the same number, comprised in about 300 villages — (C. E. Yate.) f Note. —^The Governor of the district is the Naiy r-ud-Dauleh, a Kajar Prince whose father held the Government before him, and in whose family the Government has been for the last forty years. He owns large property in the district and has done a good deal to improve the town of Nishapur. The Naiyir-ud-Dauleh a year ago went to Tehran, and there obtained the appointment of Governor of the City and Chief of the Police of Tehran. Hitherto he had to account for the revenues of Nisha pur to the Governor-General of Khorasan, but on obtaining his Tehran appointment he also got the revenue of Nishapur allotted to himself for the payment of the Tehran Police, and by this means has secured entire independence of the Khorasan Govern ment. On the departure of the Naiyir-ud-Dauleh, his son, the Fath-us-Saltaneh, was appointed to succeed him, but the people complained against him and his father recalled him two months ago and sent the Baian-us-Saltaneh in his place— {C. E. Yate, December 1897.) The Naiyir-ud-Dauleh has since been dismissed from the Governorship of Tehran as well as that of Nishapur, and another Governor has been appointed and placed under the Governor-General of Khorasan.not a separate kadkhudd. It, however, frequently happens that a village has several or many Mazra’ehs and that some of the latter are larger and contain more inhabitants than the village. The population of Bar is about 2,000. The Bar river, known lower down as the Khanluq river, has five springs or sources : (1) Ib-i-Taghan, which comes from the Kuh-i-Sarbi ; (2) Ab-i-Kaj or Kach, from the Kaj pass ; (3) Ab-i-Ganju, from the Kuh-i- Ganju ; (4) Ab-i-Tak-i-Sabz, the principal source of the river, from the Kuh-i-Tak-i-Sabz ; (5) a nameless one which comes from the Kuh-i- Kuruna. The Tak-i-Sabz source is 3| miles north-east of Bar, and 1,100 feet higher than that place. The northern side of the Kuh-i-Tak-i- Sabz is a perpendicular wall 800 to 1,000 feet high ; 8 to 12 yards above the foot of this wall is a round hole, out of which a considerable quantity of water (the Tak-i-Sabz source) flows. About 200 feet higher is another hole, and different marks on the face of the rock show that the source formerly flowed out of the upper hole. The people of Bar told me that there was a kind of plain behind the high chain of the Tak-i- Sabz, Na’ldagh, Alkhas, Tahiri, Ushturub and Zargarun peaks, and that this plain, which was several miles in extent, was bounded on its eastern side by a similar chain with high peaks. This plain has much snow in winter, and the Tak-i-Sabz spring is one of _its outlets ; another spring having its source in the plain is the Ab-i-Mirabad flowing to Nishapur, and the Chashmeh-i-Sabz “ green spring ” flowing to Meshed ; the source of the latter is a little lake. The little plain with the lake is a part of the Gulmakan country, which belongs to the Mian Vilaiat sub-district of Meshed. The distance of the green spring from Meshed is 12 farsakhs : the best road from Nishapur to it is via Buzan, 3 farsakhs ; then to the spring 4 farsakhs. The lake is most probably the lake Sovbar or Cubr, which is mentioned in the “ Bundahish ” (XII and XXII) as being situated on the mountain Kundur Asp, near Tus. A few hundred paces from the waterfall at the Tak-i-Sabz and about 20^) feet lower down, the Tak-i-Sabz stream is joined by the stream which flows from the Kurneh mountain. The river then forces its way through the rocks, cutting a narrow bed at a right angle through the strata. A mile and-a-half above Bar the valley and the river bed get wider, and receive the Ganju stream. Close to the source of the Ganju stream and on the Ardakan mountain are some old copper mines, which have not been worked for many years. The village Bar lies at an altitude of 5,425 feet, in a fine fertile valley On an isolated hill, south of the village, are the ruins of a castle, which was constructed about thirty years ago by the ’Amarlu Chief, Kurdu Khan I., the then proprietor of the village. On another hill, north of the village, are some older ruins, said to have been the site of the old village, which was destroyed by the Afghans. The village had 1,700 houses then. Bar has at present a population of about 500 souls, who pay a yearly revenue of 400 tumdns (£80). Most of the inhabitants of Bar are bigoted Saiyids, who belong to the three families Razavi, Husaini and ’All Asghari, tracing their descent from Imam Riza (buried at Meshed), Husain (the third584 NIS—NIS Imam), and’All Ashgar (a descendant of Imam Zain-ul-Ab-i-Din). The Tigh-i-Pish Asiab (literally ‘‘ the sword bef »re mill ”) mountain forms the limit of the Bar valley in the south. A small distance to the west of Bar and to the left of the Kaj stream is the Kaj pass, 6,100 feet high, and leading into the valley of the Safid Bud and the Marush plain. Some of the villages on the eastern side of the pass, like Sinas-i-Asp Bala and Pain, Karan and Siah Pala, belong to the Bar sub-district, the others belong to Marush. The western limit of the Bar sub-district is just behind the village Karakuchi, where the salt quarries are situated. From the Bar valley the Bar river flows in a southerly direction towards the Nishapur plain. On the river lie the villages ’Ara, Daminjan, Duzdbad (at the junction of the Taghan stream with the Bar river), Cheharbagh, Malik Darr h-i-Bala (pronounced Marakhdarreh) and Khanluq. The sub district Taht-i-Julgah begins at Khanluq. Some of the villages have, like Bar, ruined towers and castles, former strongholds of the ’Amarlu Chief, Kurdu Khan. The village Malik Darreh-i-Pain lies in the Taht-i-Julgah district, but belongs to the Bar district. The eastern limit of the Bar dis trict is formed by the high mountain chain with the above mentioned peaks, and a second chain with the Sarbi peak, 10,400 feet in height ; near the Tahiri and Sarbi peaks are some old lead mines. A foot-path leads from Bar to Firizi, 4 farsaJchs north-west of Bar, where there are said to be some coal beds. In the Mujam-ul-Baldan of Yaqut, Bar is men tioned as a little town near Nishapur. (2) Bar-i-Ma dan .—This sub-district lies to the west of the Bar sub district and north-west of Nishapur. Its limits are, on the north the Kuh- i-Garmab (6,550 feet), and the chain with the turquoise mines (6,675 feet); on the south the Batau mountain (6,420 feet). Bar-i-Ma’dan has very little water ; it has 16 qariyehs and some Mazrd’ehs and would be, without the existence of the turquoise mines, a very poor district. Should there be any excess of water, which rarely happens, and then only in early spring when the snows melt, it runs into the Kal-i-Mansura, and flows past Sultanabad towards Juvain. The population of the district is about 3,000 ; the two villages Ma’d n (Kaleh-i-Bala and Kaleh-i-Pain) had, in 1882, 1,241 inhabitants, and the seven Mazra’ehs belonging to Ma'dan had 260 inhabitants. Mazrd’ehs are generally called Kal&amp;teh. The Saiyids of the Ma’dan villages call themselves Husain Ashghari and trace their descent from Husain Ashgar, a son of the fourth Imam Zain-ul-Abidin. Clos^ to Garmab lies the vil'age Mazan. Other villages of the Bar-i-Ma’dan district are Nushk (or Nusk), Pehna (or Fana), Ardalan (or Aldalan, Andaran), Jazandar, Than, Barzinun. Three miles, east of Ma'dan is the S.sar peak , and at its foot is a little lake. Very few notices on the turquoise mines are found in Persian histori cal works. The earliest notice I found was in the “ Tansuk-ndmehd a book on jewels and mineralogy, by Nasr-ud-Din Tusi, written in the thirteenth century. A detailed report on the turquoise mines was written by me in 1883, and published in No. 14 (1884) of the Commercial Reports from Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Officers. Near Kaiakuchi on the eastern limits of the district are the celebrated salt quarries, and there are some old lead mines in the Batau mountains.NTS—NIS 585 (3) 'Arbakai .—This sub-district lies west of the last, and is also Ibe most westerly of Nishapur ; it has very little water and, though great in extent, only eight villages and a few Mazra’ehs, with 1,200 inhabitants. Its limits are the Kuh-i-Garmab to the north, the ’Allah and Taghan mountains to the south. Its principal village is Sultanabad, which belongs to the family of the late Sultan Murad Mirza Hisam-us-Sultaneh, and has about 100 houses. Other villages of this sub-district are Jambarju (generally called Gumbajik), Mashkan, Saidabad, Tarkhas, Khuskab, Arukli for Arkiii), Balghunabad. (4) Takdn KUh or Taghdn Kuh. —This sub-district joins that of ’Arbakai on the east ; its northern limit is the Bar-i-Ma’dan district ; southwards it extends to the Shur Rud. It has 27 villages and large mazra’ehs, and many small mazra’ehs, and 2,500 inhabitants. Most of the water of this district comes from the Taghan Kuh ; the streams of the Batau and Barab moun tains are unimportant. The principal peaks of the Taghan Kuh are the Kaleh Jiq (5,160 feet), Taghan peak (5,982 feet), and the Jisti peak (6,570 feet).

The river has much water, and is, between Miralad and Mshapur, divided into several branches, one of which sup plies Nishapur with water. The river runs with great velocity and drives many mills. Hamdulla in his “ Nuzhat -ul-Kutub ” speaks of the forty mills on this river, and adds that the wafer has so great a force, and turns the wheels so rapidly, that six hundredweight of grain are ground into flour by one mill, in the tame which it takes to sew up the sacks.

This little district formerly had a separate governor, who generally resided at Meshed, but at- present it forms one of the sub-divisions of Nishapur. It is watered by the Safid-rud and bounded on the east by the high mountains of Bar, on the west by the Bar-i-Ma’dan district, on the south by the Nishapur district and on the north by the district Sar-i-Vilaiat. The ’Amarlu Kurd, were brought here by Nadir Shah, and number at present about 500 families, which are divided into five branches, viz., Bigarlu, Urtukanlu,. Izillu, Bai, and Haftad-u-Du Millat.

In the history of the latter Sassanians, Nishapur is seldom mentioned, and when the’Arabs came to Khorasan, Nishapur must have been very unimportant ; for as Tabari relates, it did not even have a garrison. Merv was at that time the capital of Khorasan. Under the Tabaris (A. H. 205-259 ; A. D. 820—872), Nishapur became a flourishing town. Abu Tahir-ibn-i-Husain, the first sultan of the Tahiri dynasty, who died in A. D. 822, built a palace at Nishapur in the garden of Mian. To judge from the many coins of the 8amani dynasty bearing the mint mark of Nishapur, the town must have been an important place under the Samanis. The first ruler of the Saljuk dynasty—Tughral Beg—made Nishapur his residence in A. D. 1037, and his son, King Alp Arslan, had the palace of Shadiakh built for his son Malik Shah, on the occasion of the latter’s marriage with the daughter of the Great Khan in the year 1072. The meaning of the word shddidkh is most likely Shadi Kakh, i.e., “ castle of pleasure. ” Arslan Arghun, a brother of Malik Shah, destroyed the fortress Kuhandiz in 1096, and in 1153, when Sultan San jar reigned over Khorasan, the Ghaz overran the country and destroyed the town and suburb, and massacred many of the inhabi tants. A1 Muayid Aina or Aiba, one of Sanjar’s mamdliks, expelled the Ghaz in 1159 and occupied Nish'pur. In 1161, to put an end to the continual quarrels between Sunni and Shi’ah sectarians of Nishapur, Muaiyad had the leaders of both parties executed, destroyed all mosques and colleges, and burnt all libraries ; ' Shadiakh became his residence. Nishapur thus became suburb and Shadiakh became town, and was also called Shahr-i-Muaiyadi, i.e., the town of Muaiyad. It was this Muaiyad who killed the last Saljuk, Rukn-ud-Din Muhammad, a nephew of Sanjar, and he himself was killed in 1174 near Khvarazm by Takish Khan Khvarazmshah. From then until the beginning of the thirteenth century Nishapur is hardly ever mentioned as a town ; Shadiakh is the capital of the province of Nishapur. Takish Khan Khvarazm shah besieged Shadiakh in 1189, and in the year 1208, according to Hamdulla KazvinI, a terrible earthquake destroyed the whole town. It is curious that Yaqut, who visited the place in 1216, and who resided at Shad^akh, does not mention the destruction of the town eight years before. The whole town cannot have been destroyed in 1208 ; for, if it had been destroyed, the Moghuls, who came in 1221, would have had no difficulty in taking it ; but we know the town offered much resistance, in fact was only taken after three days’ assault. This time, however, the town was completely destroyed. The historians relate that the daughter of Chingiz, to revenge herself on the Nishapuris for having killed her husband Taghajar or Takachar, had the town levelled to the ground and made into a vast barley field. All the inhabitants—historians give the incredible number of 1,747,000—were massacred. Shadiakh now disappears from the pages of history. Nishapur was rebuilt, to be soon after, in 1269, partly destroyed by Moghuls under Marghaul, and in 1280 by another earthquake. In 1294, when Ghazan Khan came to Nishapur, he camped close to the town at a place called A1 Muaiyadi, evidently the place were A1 Muaiyad resided in 1161, the site of Shadiakh.

In describing Al, Colonel Hon. G. Napier (who travelled in Khorasan in 1874) alludes to this inscription and says that it records “ a victory of Muhammad ShaibanI, the Uzbeg conqueror of Bokhara, over the unbelievers, who ma,y be presumed to be the Persian Shi ahs. Though the inscription records a victory of ShaibanI Khan it was, in reality, a defeat. According 1o the.original Persian historians (Khwanda- mir, author of the “Habib-us-Siyar,” and Mlrza Haidar, author of “ Tarlkh- i-Rashidi) ” Shaibani Khan, at the time specified, led an expedition against the Kazks (not Persian Shi’ahs) of the Dasht-i-Qipchaq, the result of which was a defeat, not a victory, as boastfully recorchded in the inscription. ^ Curiously enough the tradition still current among the present inhabi tants of the village of Pan] Maneh, who are not acquainted with the pur port of the inscription, is that it was put up by an unknown king, who was defeated by certain infidels, warning others not to start on an expedition with a particular star facing them, which was the cause of his defeat.— * (Maula Bakhsh .)

There is generally very little water in the river after it leaves the mountains, as it is nearly all taken off by irrigation canals en route. The river flows down a rocky and difficult defile to within 2^-miles o^ Al, where it opens out somewhat and there is a certain amount of cultivation. Below the village the valley again contracts, the Meshed-Kalat-Kakhka road running aiung the river bed, and perpendicular cliffs rising upon either side without a break for 200 feet ; this portion of the valley as far as Qardeh is known as the Darband-i-Al. Lower down, Gazetteer. ^ va p ey a g a i n becomes a defile and is known as the Darband-i-Andarukh ; this defile is miles in length and consists simply of the bed of the stream, varying in breadth from 30 to 100 feet, including the space occupied by the water. The cliffs on either side rise sheer out of the water to a height of 200 feet, and are quite impracticable, while the bends of the defile present numerous excellent sites for forts. It can, however, be easily turned by infantry sming to right or left over the hills, which are not difficult. The Pirzu has the Si] and PIrzuvu as tributaries on the left bank and the Bulghur, Marish and Bara on the left bank. The Marish is formed by the two°streams of Karmavat and Khurkai, which unite at the village of Maiish and fall into the Pirzu near the village of Yakh. The Marish receives the Gash on the right bank. All these tributary streams constitute moun tain torrents, which have their sources in inaccessible mountains ; wherever their valleys open out, they are cultivated and produce the finest crops in Khorasan. A difficult route from Meshed to Kalat andKakhka runs up the valley of the Pirzu .—(MacGregor ; Oranoffsky, 1892.)

A village and an old stone bridge passable for all arms over theHari Rud river about 94 miles from Meshed, on the frontier line of Persia and Afghanistan. The village has good water, fuel and forage. The boundary line of the Perso-Afghan frontier runs from Hashtadan along the bed of the Kabi-Kalleh to the Hari Rud, from which point the Hari Rud forms the boundary between Afghanistan and Persia as far as the neighbourhood of the Puld-Khatfin, where the Perso-Afggan border ends. The Kashaf Rud from Meshed here joins the Hari R'ud, and emerges from tiie hills into open ground. An army could not follow the bed of the Hari Rud from Tuman Aqa to PuI-i-Khatun ; but when the river is not in flood small parties of horse or footmen can travel this road, bad though it he.—(Thomson; MacGregor; NapierStewart; Maula Baihsh.) There is a cart road practicable for field artillery and wheeled transport from Pul-i-Khatun to Sarakhs, distance 47'3 miles in 4 stages. In fine weather heliographic communication is maintained between the two places. From Pul-i-Khatiin to Zulfil«F„ distance 50 miles in 3 stages, the road is suitable for camels, impracticable for field artillery and wheeled transport.—(Routes in Central Asia, Section IJ1 % 1909.) The Russian Cantonment at Pul-i-Khatun consists of two small one storied barracks, one for the Cossacks and one for the Frontier Guards. They did not seem capable of accommodating more than 100 men each at the most. The Cossacks’ horses are under a rough shed of poles with a thatched roof. The rest of the buildings seemed like officers’ quarters and officers on a very shabby scale. There have been rumours quite recently (1909) that new barracks and stables are to be-bult. Just below the bridge the Kashaf Rud, a mere $itch at this time of the year (November) joins.. On a high hank a lewhundred yards on the road to Pas Kamar is an old caravanserai, which should be repaired and held by the Persians as an outpost. —(Maclean 1888 .) . , In order to facilitate traffic between Russian and Persian territories the bridge at Puhi-Kbatun was repaired by the Russians during 1897, half the cost being paid by the Russian Government and half by the Persian Government. i. The Hari Rud forms the boundary between Persian and Russian terri tory between Pul-i-Khathn and Sarakhs. The normal strength of the garri- son at Puhi-Khatun is a sotfnia of Cossacks, 100 strong.—(Mawk Bakhsh) There is also a Frontier Guard Post, consisting of a Commander, 15 mounted and 5 dismounted men, and 5 Turkomans.

Opposite this fort on a hill, there is a fortress, now ruined, which in former times was the original site of the village of Qadamgah, but it is said that about 200 years ago it was ransacked by the Uzbegs, who seized a large number of Saiyid families and deported them to Bukhara, where their descendants are still said to be found. There is a magnificent avenue of cedar trees in a fine garden, watered by a clear stream, in the centre of which is a neat little shrine containing a stone with the imprint of the Imam Riza’s feet upon it. The village contains about 200 families, mostly Saiyids, who were brought here from Madinah by Shah Khuda Bandeh.

QALPOSH or CHAMAN-I-QALPUSH— Lat. 37° 12' 0' ; Long. 56° 5' O'. An elevated plateau north east of Nardin in the eastern Elburz mountains, 25 miles north-west of Jajarm, and south-east of Gurgan. It is well wooded and watered, and is fertile, and it measures 10 or 12 by 6 or 8 miles. . On this plateau lie'the villages Nanik, Husainabad and Baghcheh. Its principal part is the plain called Yurt-i-Shah or Dasht-i-Shah (“ the Royal plain,”) which has on its south the Kuh-i-Chaqmaqlu, on the south west the Kuh-i-Khwaja Qambar, on the west the Kuh-i-Kalkalu, and on the north the Sara Kuh. On the Sara Kuh are the ruins of Kurang, a former village of the Garili tribe, and the modern village Husainabad. Some of the surrounding hills are barren, others are well wooded, like the Kalkalu, for instance, with oak, pear, cherry, plum, and medlar trees. Many springs rise in Qalpush, and there are some grazing-grounds. The hills abound with moufflon and the lower swampy grounds with pig ; there are also panthers and gazelles. Pheasant and partridge are plentiful. In the beginning of the last century the Qalpiish plateau was inhabited by about 10,000 families of the Garili tribe. After Nadir Shah’s death Turkomans frequently raided the country and carried many of the Garilis into slavery. Some of the Garilis then emigrated; the Aski branch remained. Aqa Muhammad Khan, Kajar, at the end of the last century, forcibly removed some of them to Mazandaran, and Zulfikar Khan of Samnan finally put an end to them aboufYO years ago. Qalpush then remained uninhabited till 1873, when the Nardinis built the village Husainabad on the Sara Kuh. Qalpush is often mentioned in history as a royal camping-ground. It is sometimes spoken of as Qalpush, sometimes as Kuh^ar-i-Qalpush. It is the part of Kuhsar pl&amp;te&amp;vi.—(Schindler, Napier.) QALQAN— Lat. 37° 28' 0'; Long. 59° 7' O'.—(Stewart.)

QARAl (No. 1) (Tribe)— A Turkish tribe of Khorasan, inhabiting the districts ofTurshlzand Tur- bat-i-Haidari, where they are said to have been brought by Timur. The chiefs of Qarai, however, appear to have lost their former pretensions to independence, and it may be assumed that, in common with the rural population of the interior districts, the Qarai would if no specially un favourable influences were at work, be available for defence in the event of invasion. The Qarai are still accounted a warlike race ; and the regi ments recruited from them, one of which is supplied by Turbat-i-Haidari and the other by Turshiz, bear a high reputation. According to enquiries made at different times from well-informed old people in Khorasan, the Qarai are Turks. They probably come from the same stock as the Ga ili (q.v.), a large number of whose families, are said to have been moved by one of the Mongol kings from Turk- istan to Syria, whence they were brought to Ears by Amir Timur and eventually from Ears to Khorasan by Shah TsmaTl Safa v i. They remain ed in the Merv and Herat districts for some time, but afterwards settled in the Turbat-i-Haidari district, which was in an almost indep ndent state in the early part of the nineteenth cent iry. They were a very powerful tribe then, but gradually their numbers decreased. Their decline was the result of rebellion, continuil persecution by the Turkomans, and fanrine. J Is-haq Khan, the well-known Qarai chief, gained great power and wa» in open rebellion during the reign of Fath ’Ali Shah Kajar, but he was killed with his son, Hasan ’Ali Khan, at Meshed by Prince Muhammad Vali Mirza in the year 1815. His second son, Muhammad Qhan Qarai then rebelled, but was coerced by Hasan ’Ali Mirza, the Shuja’-us-Sultaneh in 1819, He brake out into, rebellion again and took possession of the townQAR—QAR of Meshed in 1829, but was subdued by the troops of Ahmad ’AH Mirza, son of Fath ’All Shah, who was appointed Governor-General of Khorasan. &lt; He, however, remained in a semi-independent state during his lifetime. After his death the chiefs of the Qarai tribe lost their former indepen dence, and gradually the hereditary chiefship was abolished, and the tribe placed under the Governor of Turbat-hHaidari for the time being. They now number about 3,000 families, all of whom are in the Turbat-i- | Haidari district. Their leading khans are ’All Naki Khan Shuja’-ul-Mulk and Abdur Riza Khan. The former is commander of the local Qa,rai battalion of Khorasan and is about 55 years of age (1897). The latter is sartlj) (colonel) of the Qarai levy savars. The Qarai battalion consists of two wings of 500 men each, or 1,000 men altogether. Only half the regiment (one wing) is on service at a time, the other half always remaining on furlough. Of the wing that is on service 200 men are generally on garrison duty in the citadel of Meshed, 200 men at MuhSnMdon the PeJ-Afghan frontier, while 50 are lent to the con- tractor of the turquoise mines near Nishapur for employment as guards at the mines. The men on service are reheved every six months. The levy savars number only 150 men and are always employed in the Turbat-i -Haidari district .—(Mania Bakhsh.)

This is the best route from Shahiud to Astaiabad, and is passable for wheeled carriage ; but from the foot of the pass a dense forest extends to the vicinity of Astaiabad, the road through which is deep and wet. The pass is called by Khanikoff the ’Aliabad pass. Regarding the pass, Lovett gives the following account :— The actual ascent begins at an elevation of 3,453 feet from the wide commons of Zla at. The march from Zlarat to the pastures at Aliabad, 3 miles from the water-parting (7,600 feet), is very long ; and it is best to» break the journey at Buland Sufalleh. The road was constructed by General Buhler of the Persian Service, in 1866. It is not passable for horsed guns ; but at the date above-mentioned and since, guns have been taken across, dragged by bands of villagers. At an elevation of 4,700 feet a stratum ct gypsum is met with ; and a little higher a small serai called Robat-i-Quz- luq. Buland Sufalieh, where there is a spring, is reached at 5,200 feet. There is an open down, suitable for camping, at an elevation of 7,200 feet. Just before reaching the summit of the pass another roldt is reached, but this is now in ruins, and there are two families living there.— (Khanikoff v Napier ; Lovett ; Watson.)

The citadel, formerly a strong place with 11 towers and three-storeyed buildings, is now in ruins, excepting the bath, which has been kept in repair, and a small building occupied by the Gov ernor. The ditch round the town wall is 12 feet deep and about 15 feet wide. The citadel is situated on the east side of the town near the Meshed gate. The second gate of Radkan is opposite, on the west side of the town, and is called the Kuchan gate. Radkan is well watered, having no less than 18 water mills. It has two streams, one coming from the Zu-i-Behman and the other from the Zu-i-Radkan in the hills at the back, which join the Rashaf Rud in the marsh. In 1894 the population consisted of 4,000 families of Persians, Turks and Kurds, who owned 500 cattle, 2,000 sheep and goats, 50 horses and 100 camels. The annual production of wheat and barley was 9,000 and 6,300 Indian maunds, respectively. The village is famous for its apricots, and three kinds of this fruit called Nun, Shamsi and Shakarpara are sent to market far and wide ; it possesses a bd:ar, a public bath and a mosque.

At the village of Khasur the Maiaf is 5 yards broad, feet deep, and has a velocity of 5 feet a second. The Rushkai and Maiaf unite about 4 miles east of the village of Kashur, and under the name of the Rudfcar flow north-east down a wild ravine, formed by the Allahu Akbar range on the north and the Kharpush on the south, and enter the Trans-Caspian depression near the village of Kuzgan. The valley of the Rudbar is extremely narrow as far as Zangalan’u, is encumbered with enormous rocks and hemmed in by high, precipitous cliffs, between which the river rushes down with numerous waterfalls. Clumps of tamarisk and other trees grow in profusion along the river bank. Shortly before reaching the new village of Zangalanlu the river emerges from the defile, and the valley opens out to a width of 600 yards and is bounded by low, treeless hills. Low r er down the valley again contracts north of the village of Shamskhan and of the ruined Lushin Kaleh. The Rudbar has the greatest volume of water of all the streams flowing into the Trans-Caspian depression to the west of the Hari Rud. A track runs along the valley, but it is so difficult in the upper portion that it is of no importance either from a commercial or from a military point of view. The Turgan falls into the Rudbar at the village of Shamskhan ; it is an insignificant rivulet, whose waters do not always reach the Rudbar.— (Oranoffsky, 1894.)

This river rises in two branches, one of which runs down from between the Shah Kuh and the Shallvar Kuh, and is formed of two streamlets—one com ing from the Chilchilian pass, the other from that of Vajmanu. The other branch of the Shahrud drains the district of Pusht-i-Bustam, and has its rise from the south slopes of the Abarkuh, and, flowing past.

A village, situated in a valley about three-quarters of a mile wide, on the road between Birjand and Kain, 46 miles from the former and 25 miles from the latter. It consists of 110 houses, built on the bank of a stream, which is generally dry during the summer months. The annual production of wheat and barley in ordinary years (§ wheat, § barley) is about 900 Indian maunds, and the inhabitants possess 100 cattle and 1,200 sheep and goats. There is a water-mill, which was not in use in August 1903, but is said* to work in the cold weather when water is abundant. Camel-grazing is plentiful, but there is no fuel except dried camel-thorn. The water-supply from the Ictiriz is brackish, but a limited supply of good water is obtainable from a spring called ’All Asghar Husain, about 3 miles north-east of the village.— (Wanliss, August 1903; Mac'pherson, 1905.) RUNlZ TAPPER or NAURlZ TAPPER or NtJZAR TAPPER or NAURUZ TAPPER— About a mile to the north of the Safiabad village in the Bam-Safiabad district of Khorasan lies a long, low, narrow hill, called by the people Runlz Tappeh or Tappeh-i-Nauriz or Runlz, a corruption from Nuzar, which is said to be the proper word, Nuzar having been one of the last of the Pish- dadian kings who ruled Persia prior to the KaianI dynasty, who came to power in B. C. 708. To the east of this mound are the ruins of a caravan- serai, strongly built in stone and mortar, a rare thing in these parts. “ The mound, which is some 500 yards in length by 50 or 60 in breadth and some 50 feet high, was tunnelled throughout its entire length. This , tunnel had been run through the harden d mud immediately 'under the fiat conglomerate rock, and apparently in olden times was of sufficient height for a man to walk upright. Now, the hardened mud has mostly fallen in and has blocked up the floor, and it is only possible to creep along and at places the opening is only big enough for a man to crawl through! One of my men went in for a distance of some 250 yards. Apparently! the tunnel consists of a main street with little rooms at each side; each room had a small well in it; atpiesent they are tenanted solely by hyaenas and porcupines, which apparently abound in the place. One entrance was under the old gateway of the city about a third of the way down from the northern end, the other two were near the southern end, all on the western side. A fourth entrance we found at the northern end on the eastern side. All these entrances apparently communicated with each other in olden times. Inside the entrance, under the old gate way, is a well now only 20 feet deep, but the old Saiyid declared that he remembered it very deep with running water at the bottom and that only lately had it got filled up. In the middle of the mound the men told me they found what seemed to have been a water mill and a wall, that had been built up with burnt bricks on one side of the tunnel. From the well a narrow passage runs down to the north, and this apparently led underground to a low hill beyond which the Saiyid declared, there were also rooms exacavated inside. ^ He pointed* oat where the entrance was that he had found, under a grave and now blocked up. Night was falling, and I had no time to open it up, although634 RUS—RUS the Saiyid declared that one of the rooms inside contained ten or fifteen skulls and skeletons. Three or four miles to the north of Sankhas is a large and fine robdt, some 2 miles from the present village of Kill. This robdt formed one of the stages on the ancient high road from Gurgan to Meshed, which, the Sani-ud-Dauleh says, ran from Gurgan by Ears, Dehaneh-i- Gurgan, Dehaneh-i-Dasht, Karabil, ’Ishq, Kill, Qarajeh, Nasirabad, Sultan Maidan, Hasanabad, Chambar Chlrbal, Saidabad, and Shankaleh to Meshed, at all of which places the'e were robdts or rest-houses. The probability is that the robdt and ruined town described above were the Nasirabad of this route.”— {C. E. Yate.)

To the east it is divided from Nishapur by a low, barren ridge, which connects the two above-mentioned ranges, and on the west it has a desolate tract bordering on the kavlr, separated by the Kuh-i-Mish. Its length is about 75 miles and its breadth 40, giving it an area of about 3,000 square miles. The northern part near the hills is fertile, cultivation being carried on by means of qandts. The population may amount to 45,000 souls, and principally consists of Per sians, with some Kurd, Turk and Baluchi nomads. There are no troops in the district; but the anned peasantry might furnish some 8,000 men. All supplies are very scarce throughout the district. It contains the following eight sub-divisions, v^z. :—(1) Mazinan, (2) Kah, (3) Bashtin, (4) Qassabeh, (5) Tiqab, (6) Barakuh, (7) Garrab, (8) Tabas. The province suffered severely from the famine of 1871, and is said to have lost 24,000 souls by death and emigration. It produces silk, cot' on, wheat, and a small supply of opium. It exports wheat to Astarabad, with dried fruits, cotton, and sheepskins, receiving cooking utensils, etc., in return. There is a rich copper mine in the hills near the town of Sabzawar, the ore of which during the famine was sold for its weight in bread. There are borax mines in the adjoining Kuh-i-Mish mountain. The annual revenue of the Sabzawar district is Tumdns 35,338 in cash, 2,545 kharwdrs of grain (f wheat, | barley), and 4,046 kharwdrs of chopped straw. - The annual output of grain is estimated at 20,400 kharwdrs ; but this amount being insufficient for the requirements of the district, grain has to be imported from Nishapur and Sar-i-Yilaiat.

Silkworms are cultivated and Sabzawar has 8 manufactories of silk stuffs. Cotton and raw silk are exported to Russia by Russian Armenians residing at Sabzawar. There is a telegraph office in the town.

The place has a bath and an ice-house, both half ruined, and water by four subterranean canals, which, however, give very little water, not having been cleaned for many years. In 1875 the Shah granted the sum of £120 for cleaning the canals, but the money was pocketed by the then Prime Minister. The caravanserai has 22 rooms.

Looking south-west from ’Alas, a small village about 7 miles north west of Safiabad, the horizon is bounded by the long line of hills that run to the south of Tabas and- Jaghatai. Between these hills and this place lies a long line of low hills or mounds, which divide the Safiabad-Mangli plain from Juvain. So far as I can ascertain, the drainage of the Garmab stream at Safiabad lies to the north of this line of low dividing hills or mounds, and runs down to Mang li and thence to Garati. The plain is of soft alluvial soil, and is cultivated in places where water is obtainable from the hills. Out in the open it is dotted with the black tents of Za’afaranlu Kurds of Kuchan, who graze their camels and sheep here during the winter months. The land and villages belong to the Safiabad district. The Safiabad valley is some 12 miles in width in its upper part, but gradually narrows till it gets to Garati. It has little water in its lower parts, and the plain is practically nothing but a grazing ground. Garati is the last village in the Safiabad district, and shortly below it the Bam and Safiabad streams unite and run down together towards Jajarm, quite separate from the drainage of the Isfarain valley.— {C.

A large body of this tribe in 1880 left the Tekke country, entered Persia, and settled at Zurabad and near the Kashaf Rud. In 1832, after the cap ture of the old town of Sarakhs by ’Abbas Mirza, a portion of the Salurs to whom that town belonged, were settled near ZGrabad. But when the Tekke Turkomans in the Merv country became powerful, they found these Salurs settled in Persia a thorn in their side ; and during the period of the great Persian famine of 1871 the whole of the Salurs settled at Zurabad and in its neighbourhood were, partly by force and partly by persuasion, moved off and settled in the Merv country along the Murghab river. The tribe was broken up and divided among the different sections of the Merv Tekke. They do not appear to have found their position as a subordinate tribe a very pleasant one ; and in 1881 about 1,500 families ofthemcamebacktoPersia, and the majority settled near Zurabad. Some* settled at Akdarband on the Kashaf Rud, and some within 13 miles of Turbat-i-Shiikh Jam, at a place c-lied Nl ! abad. A fine fort was built at Zurabad by the Persians, and a garrison quartered there to keep the Salur Turkomans in order. The Salur Turkomans settled in Persia were not, however, very contented. The tribe, being small, has no separate political existence. They were renowned for their bravery and cruelty, so much so that any deed of unusual barbarity was at once attributed to them. In 1881 they numbered 4,000 families, and were scattered along both banks of the Murghab, together with the Sarik, with whom they appeared to act in conjunction in matters relating to their common neighbours. The Russians occupied Merv in 1884, and three months later took posses sion of old Sarakhs. They issued a proclamation that all Turkomans were thenceforth Russian subjects, whereupon the Persians were advised to get rid of the Turkoman subjects at once, lest the Russians should push forward further to include them. Accordingly the Salur Turkomans were ! driven out of Pers’an territory, and went over to Russian Sarakhs, where they are settled, as Russian subjects, at present. Their o6us are situated at about two m'les from the town of Russian Sarakhs, extending in a semi circle for a distance of about 6 miles. The tribe is d ; vided into three sections, viz., the Karaman, the Kuchik Iqa and the Ukarchukti. There are in all, according to the census 2,400 families. Each section has seven obas, and a complete obd should have 143 tents, or kibitkas % as the felt Tu koman tents are called. Thus there are 21 o&amp;as.

The extent of cultivation in this valley and the population are far in excess of what might be supposed on merely passing through it by the road bet ween Birjand and Kain. The fact is, that the villages are concealed from view in the secluded nooks and glens of the hills around, each of them having its own farmsteads and hamlets, with vineyards and fruit gardens. The fruits produced are plum, apricot, jujube, apple, peach, almond, mulberry, etc. The chief crops are wheat and barley, the soil being light and gravelly ; and the common vegetables are carrots, turnips, onions, beet, cabbages, etc. In summer the hill pastures are resorted to by nomads with their flocks of goats and sheep and herds of camels. The hills abound in game, such as the ‘ markhor’ and ‘ ibex’ (both species of wild goat) and the wild sheep. The leopard, hysena, and wolf are also found in them, but not the bear. The country generally is devoid of trees, but supports an abundant growth of pasture, plants, and bushes suitable for fuel The surface is covered with wormwood and a dwarf, yellow rose with dark purple centre, called, ‘ khalura,' which affords good pasture for cattle. Very superior carpets are manufactured in this district.— (Beltew.) , v ...SEHDEH (No. 2) (Village)—Lat. 33° 21' 0' ; Long. 59° 10' John), A village in the Alghur sub-division of the Kain district of Khorasan.

After a few years they were forced to relinquish the frontier, and move westward into the hilly country draining west into the Grurgan and north-west into the Atrak. At that time the villages of the Garf i Turks on the northern feeders of the Atrak had been destroyed, and the Shadillu appear never to have been in sufficient force to re-occupy them. With a rough country much exposed to the north and west to hostile attacks, they have lost in numbers, and have failed to attain to the affluence of their cousins of Kuchan. Their special privileges ai}d partial independence will probably be maintained longer than that of the other tribes. It may be reckoned as able to turn out, at the bidding of their Ilkldnl, about 3,000 armed men. The villagers are almost invariably of fine physique, armed with good guns of native make, and accustomed to a life of almost constant warfare. The IlklidnVs jurisdiction extends over Simalqan and March on the Atrak, Jajarm, and Isfarain, a length of 90 and breadth of 50 miles round Bujnurd In 1894 it was estimated that the Shadillu Kurds numbered altogether some 15,000 families.— {C.

The rums, called locally the Shahr-i-Bilcjis, consist of two parts, the citadel and the city. The citadel is 320 yards in length and 150 in breadth measured inside, and some 400 yards in length measured outside, and stands on a mound or rampart some 20 or 30 feet above the plain, and sur rounded by high, mud walls. To the north-east of this citadel lie’the walls of the ancient city of Isfarain, some 2 or 3 miles in circumference These have been much washed away, but are still 10 or 12 feet thick in places*. The ground inside the walls has been a good deal ploughed up and levelled, but many mounds still remain, and many coins and relics are said to be found in them. To the south of Shahr-i-Bilqis there is an ulavg or marsh affording good pasturage, the springs in which give rise to a stream that waters five villages on the southern side of the valley. The Jama Masjid buildings in the centre of the old city existed within the memory of the present generation, and they have only been destroyed of late years by people carrying off the bricks. One coin found in the ruins that we saw also had the word Isfarain clearly marked on it. It is difficult to ascertain how long the city has been deserted, but, according to local tradition, it was destroyed by Afghans under Mumin Khan, presumably in the invasion of 1731. Whenever it was, the walnut trees have now entirely disappeared, and Isfarain stands a deserted heap of low mounds, stones and broken bricks, out in the open plain—(O. E. Yate, 1897.)

Good fruits are grown, especially grapes and melons, and much cultiva* tion is carried on at villages in the vicinty, and care is taken to have large supplies stored in Shahrud. For eight months in every year, dating from the vernal equinox, this road to and from Meshed is traversed by 60,000 persons.

An agency of the Russian Caucasus and Mercury Company has been established here for some time, and the transac- tions of the Company amount to about 50,000 tumans per annum. The Russians have also a summer retreat at Ratrkar, 28 miles from Shahrud. It has been for some years the entrepot of every kind of merchandise, and specially for the rice of Mazandaran. Its manufacture of boots and shoes is most celebrated in Persia, not only for the elegance of the work manship, but for the quality of the leather.

Another road, which may be called the fourth, goes off from Jajarm through the Isfarain plain and, passing Sultan Maidan, comes out into the Meshed plain near Radkan ; it would be about 290 miles.

On the road there is plenty of grass and fuel, but no running water. The Khan said plenty of water could be found by digging ; soil seemed excellent, and the whole country could be cultivated. The whole presented the general appearance of an immense undulating plain, bounded on the south by Yakeh Taqlan range, the western portion of which is called Kara Shikan, and a prominent peak, Chunda ’Abb^s. This range is well clothed with forest, and said to swarm with game. Its grassy meadow seemed very inviting, and, according to the Khan, is a grand place for summer quarters. To the north are the Guli Dagh and Taghan Kuh ranges, which seem con tinuations of one another, and beyond them is the Atrak. The latter is bare and precipitous on its southern side, while the former has numerous open, grassy slopes and downs, surrounded by dense oak forests. It is surprising to see oak forests making their appearance so suddenly. The Khan says that the Guli Dagh abounds in maral (red deer) and roe deer, and is enchanting in spring and summer. On its northern slopes are many open park-like spaces in the midst of the forests. From camp it presented the appearance of bdra singh ground in Kashmir. The Yakeh Taqlan is well sprinkled with juniper. At its western extremity is a remarkable conical hill, from which westwards are oak forests, which then commence suddenly on the ranges north and south of the valley. The place is known as Shaugha Shahabad from the ruins of two villages in the vicinity. Shaugha has several old qandts, and was formerly inhabited by Garili Turks, but it has been lying waste since the death of Nadir.

It has a population of about 2,000 families, nearly all Turks of the Garili tribe who speak Turk!. The town is built on an oblong, with sides of 600 by 300 yards, and sur rounded by a high, loop-holed wall, very much in disrepair. There are two gates—the Kuchan and Bujnurd darvdzehs ; there is one good street, which leads from the first-named gate to the west to the Khan’s house; the rest axe all irregular and narrow. At the south-west corner there is a mound about 100 feet high and with a diameter of about 300 yards at the base, on which is built the citadel, which completely commands the town, but which is itself also under the command of the hills on the south.

It is situated 216 miles from Heiat, 155 miles from BIrjand, 220 miles from Shahiud, 117 miles from Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam, and 30 miles north-west from Turbat-i-Haidari. It is a considerable walled village, but the walls and ditches have fallen into a state of complete disrepair. It contains 6,000 inhabitants and is surrounded by many flourishing villages. About 100 houses here were formerly inhabited by Hindus from Multan, and they occupy a quarter where they conduct business without molestation or insult. The inhabitants are Persians. The trade of this place arrives chiefly from the importation of indigo and other dyes from the west, and wool; cloth and rice from Herat. The prunes, generally known as dlu bu- khdra, chiefly come from Suitanabad, and raisins and other dried fruits, as also cotton and wool, are exported thence in large quantities. Formerly a large amount of silk was produced in the village and neigh bouring districts, but it has decreased very much of late years, and now (1906) comparatively little is produced and no eggs or silkworms are exported. Cotton-growing is now very much on the increase, and a machine for cotton-cleaning has recently been set up (1906).

The plain is bounded on the north by the Garab Kuh and ’Ashuq Kuh, on the west by the Isfarain mountains, on the south by the watershed dividing it from the Marus plain, and on the east by the Haidari and Dalba mountains. The average elevation of the plain is about 5,200 feet. The Sultan Maidan river forms part of the Kaleh-i-Mura system.— (Schindler.) SUMBAR— Lat. 37° 52' 0'. Long. 55° 20' 0'—(Napier). A tributary of the river Atrak, which it joins at Chat, ^bout 100 miles from its mouth. In the upper part of its course it bears the name of the ‘ Sunt ’ river. Its general course is along the bottom of a steep-sided ravine, the bed of which is more or less flat ; and in its midst is the river channel, varying in width from a few feet to 20 or 30 feet. It generally contains but little water; and in April, at its junction with the Atrak at Chat, it is said to have little more than a foot of water, which can be crossed by an easy jump. From the size of the ravine, however, and from the dimensions of the channel itself, it is probable that at times the mass of water must be very considerable. Small as is the usual quantity of water in the Sumbar, the river presents an almost insuperable obstacle to beasts of burden, and especially to camels even when not laden. This is due to the sides of the river sloping regularly at an angle of 45°, and owing to the slippery nature of the loamy soil when moistened, which then resembles a soaped board, and renders it almost impossible to get out of the water without assistance, or even to stand in the water within one’s depth, as the sides slope togetherSULTANABAD.—(TURSHIZ ).—Insert after present entry :—. “ The following note was written by Major Sykes in 1910 :—• In medieval times Turshlz was known as Pusht or Buskt- al-Arab, and formed the north-west district of the province of Kuhistan, of which the two chief towns were Turshiz (now Firuzabad) and Kundur, w T h:ch is still an important centre. In the twelfth century the district was seized by the Ismailis, beter known to us as the Assassins : but a century ater Hulagu Khan destroyed their power. Yet another century passed when Tamerlane appeared, and. sacked the ancient capital, which has since that date lain desolate. The present town was founded by Abdul *Ali Khan, Gov ernor of Herat, under Nadir Shah, and completed by his son Mustafa Quli Khan, a contemporary and rival of Ishaq Khan of Turbat. It is w r alled and contains a population of 7,000 to 8,000 inhabitants, but suffered considerably during the earthquake of 1903, which fortunately affected only a small area. The town is now known as Turshiz. Adjoin ing it is a village now termed Sultanieh, with gardens and a ruined shrine to Saiyid Hamza Riza, brother of the Imam Riza, which can boast of some fine firs and cypresses. In the latest map Turshiz docs not appear as the name of a town ; but this is no longer correct. Sultanabad, which is shown is now termed Sultanieh,” {Sykes, 1910.)690 SUN—SUE, cultivated than wheat, and they buy wheat and barley from Tabas and from Zir Kuh. There is a service of 96 savars of whom 25 are at Gazik, 25 at Dastgird and 10 at Darmian. Gazik is a flourishing place, and pays a revenue of 75 q tumans. The total revenue of Sunnlkkaneh is nearly 5,000 tumans. Tabas is an old polygonal-shaped fort, with bastions at close intervals, and surrounded by a deep ditch 45 feet broad. Though now crumbling to pieces, it has been a strong place. “There is a Naib of Tabas who usually resides in Darmian, a large village on the road to BIrjand up a fertile ravine, which produces excellent fruit, and is remarkable for its magnificent walnut trees. At the entrance to this ravine is a very picturesque and well-built fort that looks like a castle, called Furk.* The hills behind, however, command it, and it has been captured by a former Amir of Kain. It is the only fort I have seen in Persia built of solid masonry. They are generally made of mud or sun-dried bricks. The inhabitants of this buluk are all Sunnis. It is peculiar that the Sunni religion should have survived here, while the people of Zir Kuh, who are more in touch with Afghanistan, are Shi’ahs. In 1747 all this country was taken from Persia by the Afghans. The people of Sunnikhaneh seem to keep pretty much to themselves. They furnish some of the best recruits for the two regiments of the Amir of Birjand.”— (H. D. Napier, 1893 ; Kennion , 1908.) SUNT— Lat. 38° 12' 0'.; Long. 55° 42' O'—{Napier).

At 3 miles from Ahmadabad it turns south, but fails to reach the Kashaf Rud, as all its water is taken off for irrigation purposes. The river has a small volume of water, as, after it irrigates the cultivation of the villages of Tabadkan and Ahmadabad, the flow ceases altogether, but begins again some 3 miles lower down where it is fed by a spring. In its upper course the Tabadkan flows down a precipitous defile ; between the villages of Tabadkan and Ahmadabad the valley opens to a breadth of | mile and is cultivated. Farther south the valley again contracts to a width of 300 yards, but the hills on either side are easy. {Oran- off shy, 1894.) TABADKAN (No. 3) (Village)—Lat. 36° 30' 0'; Long. 60° V^—{Napier).

In this defile lies the source of the Atrak river, which first bears the name of the Tabarik rivulet, and then that of Khanam Darreh. At a short distance from its source the Tabarik is joined by the Bacheh Vallu stream, issuing from between the Giuni and Shakaru mountains. From this point the Tabarik runs in a south-westerly direction, and, being joined by the Nukh, flows west to Kuchan, near which place the Qaraul Dimi mountain abuts on its right bank, the left or southern side of the river being a smooth expanse, on which the old city of Kuchan is situated. Thus far only is the river known by the name of Tabarik.—(PefrwsmM.) TABARIK (No. 2) or TABARI (Village) (called by the natives TAVARIK or TAVARI)— Lat. 30° 9' 30'. Long. 58° 41' 20'—(Vaper). A village in Kurdish Khorasan, on the road from Muhammadabad to Kuchan. It is prettily situated in a little valley, surrounded by picturesque mountains and by many trees. It has a good deal of cultivation ; but might have much more, as no less than four fairly plentiful streams discharge their water into it. One of these streams is the chief source ^ of the Atrak river. It is crossed at Tabarik by a small bridge. The village contains 50 families of Kaivanlu Kurds, who own 100 cattle, 400 sheep and goats, 10 horses and 50 camels. The normal annual production of wheat and barley is 7,200 Indian maunds.— {MacGregor ; Oranoffsky, 1894.) TAB AS (No. 1) (District)— The south-westerly district of Khorasan. It is bounded on the west south and east by the Lut. To the south-west, the boundary between694 TAB—TAB Tabas and Yazd is formed by a sand-belt on the Yazd-Tabas road, half way between Pusht-i-Badam and Rolat-i-Khan. On the north, Tabas adjoins the Turshiz and Turbat-i-Haidari districts, and on the east Khaf and Kain. Although the Government is usually located at Tabas, where the Governor’s property is situated, the district is in reality composed of five divisions or buluks : Tabas, Tun, Gunabad, Bushruleh and Bijistan, Tabas being the least important of the five, and the district is usually referred to as “ Tun and Tabas.” Of the five districts Tabas is the poorest. Two-thirds of it is composed of plain or Lut, with a low range of hills to the north. The soil is arid, the country poverty-stricken, and the rainfall scanty. The wheat crops do not provide six months ’ food for the population. As a com pensation, however, date and orange trees are plentiful, and the people exchange their produce for wheat. An exceptionally cold winter in 1904 caused the greatest damage to the orange groves of Tabas, and during the following season scarcely any fruit was produced. Asafoetida is produced in very large quantities on the borders of the desert and sent to India. The Persians make no use of it. It is the produce of a plant called in Persia ‘Anguza'’ which grows in the most arid tracts. The plant is cut down and a sticky, very evil-smelling gum exudes, which forms small lumps on the cut stems. This is carefully collected, and the stems cut again and again, so as to cause more gum to exude. A fine plant will bear cutting 14 times in the season, which lasts about eight months,—from spring until autumn. The districts of Tun and Gunabad are more fertile, their hills being used as a Ydlldq by the nomad tribes of the district. Good cultivation and fine gardens exist in both. A range of high hills—the LaqI range—separates Tun from Gunabad, the northern slopes of this range giving to the latter division its fertile character. The importance of Tabas lies in the fact that it is the first cultivated area met with in the northern portion of the eastern Lut, and that of Tun in its being the first town reached on the main road from Kirman to Meshed. The principal route traversing Tabas is the main caravan route from Yazd to Meshed. It avoids the town of Tabas itself, and circling round to the north-west passes through Chchar Deh one stage distant. The chief wealth of the district consists of sheep and camels, of Sheep and camels. which ^ latter are the more important and are bred in the great arid plains in great num bers.

The inhabitants of Tabas are of the ’Arab tribe of Ibn-i-Sharban, who were brought there by one of the kings of In a itants. the Safavian dynasty. The remaining inhab itants of the district are mostly Bersians, with some Baluchi nomads. Tabas was termed “ Tabas-at-Tamr ” or “ Tabas of the date-palm ” by the ’Arab geographers, to distinguish it from His ory ' “ Tabas-al-’Unnab ” (jujube-tree) to the east of Birjand. The date of its foundation is unknown, but it is connected by place names with Parthian times. In A. H. 31 (651 A.D.) Tabas was conquered by the Khalif Uthman and later on it became the centre of the famous Isma’ili sect, whose tenets are responsible for the modern word ‘ ‘assassin ’ ’ and for the true story of the ‘ ‘ Old Man of the Mountain. ’ ’ In the eleventh century A. D. it was known as Tabas Gilaki after a chief who had conquered it, and in the eighteenth century Nadir Shah conferred the district on’Ali Murad Khan, an ’Arab of the Zangui tribe, in return for services rendered to him when lost in the But. This tribe is connected with that of the Amirs of Kaln, the Khuzai. The same family still govern the district.— (Yate ; Maula Bakhsh ; Sykes, 1906.) TABAS (No. 2) (District)— One of the buluks of the Sabzawar district of Khoiasan. It is a fine well-watered tract to the north-east of Sabzawar, including the lower spurs and skirts of the Jaghatai-Juvain hills. It is considered the best buluk of the district. Grain crops are raised without irrigation on the hill slopes ; and on the plain a good deal of silk and cotton. There are 15 principal villages.— (Bellew ; Napier.) TABAS (No. 3) (District)— One of the buluks (sub-divisions) of the Rain district of Khorasan.

It is the chief town of the district of the same name and situated on a gravel slope which runs gently downwards from the western foot of the lofty Shuturi range, and terminates in a salt desert some miles to the west of and below the town. The surrounding country, jvhere water has not been brought to irrigate Soil. is bare and unproductive, consisting chiefly of great gravel plains, which afford a certain amount of grazing to camels, sheep, and goats. The town with its adjacent gardens and detached houses extends from Town. east wes ^ ^ or H miles, and is | mile in breadth from north to south. The old walled town lies to the extreme west. The east and west faces are 400 yards in length, and the north and south faces 700 yards. It has two gateways—one in the centre of the east, and the other in the centre of the west face. Each gate is flanked by a couple of round towers. The walls are built of sun-dried bricks, and gradually taper away to the battlements, and are necessarily of considerable thickness, probably 6 to 8 feet at the base, and about 18 inches on the rampart. The walls are loop- holed, and strengthened by the insertion of circular towers at intervals. A broad and deep dry ditch surrounds it. The walls appear to be built on a low mound. The ditch is crossed by a brick bridge at each of the gateways. The interior of the town is in a ruinous condition, the greater part of the inhabitants having left it and built houses to the east, where the new town stands. The old bazar, which is at the east end of the fort, is a long and lofty structure with a \aulted roof , but many of the shops are empty as the traders prefer to sell their goods in the stalls outside. The new town owes its origin to the cessation of Baluch and Turkoman raids, which have not occurred for more than 30 years. Opposite the east gate of the town is the new bazar, which contains 150 shops, 30 of which are empty. There is a new caravanserai in it. Up the centre of the new town runs a broad avenue overhung by mulberry and walnut trees and with streams flowing down either side. To the right and left he the better class of houses, each separate within its gardens and enclosures. The governor lives in a palace situated in the new town. It contains several fine reception rooms, and has some magnificent gardens attached The citadel is built on an immense mound about 30 feet high, and is Citadel. situated in the centre of the south face of the old town. It is about 80 yards square, and has round corner towers, and one in the centre of each face.

On it, and immediately above the town, are seven flour-mills worked by water. There are also five qandt streams. During the rainy season a vast quantity of water is caught by dams to the south-east of the town and employed in watering the fields. Galindo is m agreement with this opinion, but several previous travellers have stated that water is bad and scarce. If such had ever been the'case, it is extremely improbable that Tabas would have been selected as the site for a large town.

TEJEN (River)— The continuation of the Hari Rud river (q.v.) north from Pul-i-Khatun is so called. From a point nearly due east of Kafir Kaleh, the Hari Rud and its continuation, the Tejen, form the boundary between Persia and Trans- caspia. The Tejen flows past Daulatabad and to the east of Sarakhs. I. B 4 u706 TEJ—TIL Near tne first-named place it runs with a very diminished stream between high, steep banks ; and at Sarakhs is generally dry except in the spring or after rain, the bed being filled with thick tamarisk jungle. OranofEsky states that in May 1904 the river at Sarakhs was 50 paces wide and 21 feet deep. Much farther down, at Kangli, where the caravan road from Kara Chehcheh crosses the stream, it is said to be 200 yards wide, or, as it was described, it was a gunshot across, meaning a shot from an ordinary Persian rifle. Beyond this point opposite Mihna, where crossed by Mr. O’Donovan in March 1881, it is described as a sluggish stream, the water surface scarcely 50 yards wide, and in depth reaching over the horse’s girths. The banks here are of sandy marl, and grow plenty of trees and brushwood—the former from 4 to 8 inches in diameter—also a large amount of drift wood. Soon after this it is said to divide into four small streams, sometimes dry and sometimes containing water. The nearest of these branches to the Atak is the smallest and rarely has water in it; this is the one that fills the pool at Adna Avaz. Beyond this is a second branch of the Tejen called Kizil Jar. Beyond this again a third branch called Kachilli. The fourth or farthest branch of the Tejen passes near Mamur. In this branch there is nearly always water, though the other branches are often dry. At Mamur there is a fine well, besides the water which comes from the Tejen. On the branch of the river which passes near Cha^gal there are large pools of water and great reeds. The Turkomans leave this neighbourhood in the summer, as their cattle are much troubled by the heat and insects. The branch of the Tejen which passes Adna Avaz is lost in the Kara Kum desert, near a place called Kir Kuit, at .a distance of 24 hours’ ride from Askbabad. The country where the river ends is very heavy sand, and would be quite impassable for guns. This part of the country is known as Minara from a ruined mindr, or pillar, which used to be there. The Kizil Jar branch ends at a place called Palisanthi in the desert to the eastward of the Adna Avaz branch. The Kachilli branch ends at a place called Musa, still more to the eastward. The Mamur branch goes past a place called Tugul to Khurgujaz, where it is absorbed in the Kara Kum desert. There is very heavy sand where these streams cease, but no marshes. The Russians, however, show a marsh in their map, published in 1881, as the end of the river. There is some small amount of water with large reeds at Changal ; but this is far away from the swamp shown on the Russian map. Logofett says t hat the main branch crosses the Central Asian Railway at the station of Tejend, and loses itself in the sands about 15 miles beyond. The Tejen has the greatest volume of water from about the beginning of March till the end of May, and the least from about the beginning of September till the end of December.— (MacGregor', Stewart', O' Donovan \ Orano^sA:y, 1894; Logofett, 1902.) /See Sakakhs. tilAb— A village in Khorasan, 1 mile from Kuchan, on the road to Darreh Gau.

There are also a few Saiyids of Tun and Tabas. Much rice and a little wheat are grown here, and grain is kept in silos. A short distance from the village and to the north is the Kuh-i-Kiz Kaleh—(“ mountain of the virgin’s fort ”) so called from the ruins of a fort on its summit; it commands the Chunash pass, which a little beyond the ruin gets very narrow ; for \ mile it is only 4 yards wide.

It has no manufactures of any value ; though the silk is worked up into inferior articles of attire. The people of the dun valley are extremely quRt and peaceable; and though they generally have arms in their houses, none are ever seen outside.

Between the last-named hills and Turbat-i-Haidari the valley is traversed from north to south by a broad and shallow stony river-bed, in which a thin stream of water occurs. Cultivation extends on all sides up to the walls, and numerous villages are situated close to the city. The importance of Turbat-i-Haidari as a trade-centre is derived from the Communications. fact ofit bein 8 tlie meetin g P^ce of numerous routes, leading from south and south-western Persia, northern Khorasan and Afghanistan. A narrow gap at the south-west corner of the valley gives access to the main trade-route from Sistan to Meshed, and by the same opening the road from Turshiz, the continua tion of a little-used and somewhat waterless road from Tehran, reaches the town. A little farther to the east, the road to Khaf crosses the south ern barrier by a low and easy col, while the route to Kaiiz and Herat runs almost due east down the Julgah-i-Zava. At the north-west corner of the valley the road to Meshed crosses the northern range either by the Baidar pass, or, a short distance to the west, by the lower and easier Khamari pass. From the latter a road branches to Nishapur, and there joins the Meshed-Tehian road. Turbat-i-Haidari, or, as it is sometimes called, Turbat-i-Is-haq Khan The cit derives its name from the tomb of a renowned Darvish Qutub-ud-Din Haidar (1156-1231 A.D.) His tomb is marked by a red-brick mausoleum on a mound to the north-west of the city, and it is commonly believed that the site formed the centre of an old town which was destroyed by a severe flood. The present town is surrounded by a weak and dilapidated mud wall, with ruined bastions every 70 ya’ds, affording Defences. hut little protection, and beyond this has no other defences. The town, moreover, has outgrown its walls, the better quarters, in par ticular the southern quarter, known as the Bagh-i-Sultan, being situated outside. At the north-east corner of the walls are the ruins of an old fort, the Ark of Is-haq Khan. The principal feature of the interior of the town is the bazar formed of g- zdr f° ur streets radiating north and south, and east and west, from a central dome ; the whole of the bazar being covered in by domed roofs. No buildings of note exist. There are 210 shops. There are 5 caravanserais and 3 robots, capable of accommodating some 2,000 persons, 7 baths, 3 mosques and a madraseh or college, and about 5 0 shops. A new caravanserai to accommodate 500 persons is under con struction. A British Consulate was established in 1903. The establishment con sists of a Consul, a British telegraphist and Consulate. a ]y[ ec p ca i Officer, with subordinate staff and an escort of 25 Indian savdrs. 4x2716 TUR—TUR It is also the head-quarters of a sanitary cordon, formerly under the exclusive control of a Russian officer; it has now (1906) been nominally handed over to the Persian Government, but the Russian officer remains on as usual; there are two Russian doctors, One at Turbat-i-Haidari and one at , Karlz, and a Cossack officer at Kariz employed on quarantine work. The savdrs of the cordon belong to the Russian-trained Tehran Cossack Brigade. Previous to the great famine of 1871, Turbat-i-Haidari was a flourishing . and populous town. During the years of scarcity, opu a ion. 1868-1871, the population is said to have been reduced by 20,000. It has, however, to some extent recuperated at the present date—mainly owing to increased trade with Russia and Afghanis tan—and is now estimated at 3,000 houses with a population of 12,000 to 15,000 souls. The towns-folk are mainly of Qaiai stock, but many of the chief merchants and artizans are Yazdis. The climate of Turbht-i-Haidari is exceedingly healthy. Owing to its elevation it is sometime colder both in winter Climate and water-supply. an{ j summer than that of Meshed, and the snowfall is more considerable. The water-supply is ample from several channels, and the quality of the water is good. Turbat-i-Haidari proper is supplied by a Tidnz brought from the hills some 15 miles distant to the north and called the Chashmeh- i-Divaneh, and by several streams which feed the main nala. The surrounding country being very fertile, so much so that wheat and „ .. barley are largely exported to other districts, plentiful supplies, both of grain and meat (mutton) are available, and in a normal year prices range lower for country products than in Meshed. Fruit is plentiful and good, apricots, plums, almonds, and excellent melons being the principal varieties. Few industries, properly so-called, exist. Industries and produce. The principal sources of income of the inhabitants are— (1) Wool-buying —Wool from southern Khorasan and Afghanistan is purchased and exported to Russia. The establishment of a factory at Kariz,* where the wool is cleaned and exported direct, has to some extent affected the Afghan branch of the trade, and will probably produce a further depreciation in the future. (2) Silk production. —Turbat-i-Haidari was formerly famous for its silk. This industry, which at one time declined, has now revived, and is in a flourishing condition, the output for 1904-05 being valued at tumdns 80,000 ; it is still on the increase. The silk is wound off the cocoons locally, and exported to Meshed and Yazd. There are 40 silk-winding factories in the town. Eggs are also locally bred and sold. The mulberry tree is abundant and forms a distinctive feature of the landscape. •Latest accounts say this factory is to be abandoned.(3) Fruit-growing.—A large quantity of almonds and dried fruits is sent to Russia and to other parts of Persia. (4) Trade in carpets .—The Baluch nomads bring in carpets, which are purchased and generally sent to Meshed. (5) Grain export .—Large quantities of wheat and barley are sent to Nishapur, Sabzawar and Turshiz. Opium, locally grown, is sent to Meshed for export abroad. (6) Manufacture of copper utensils — The most considerable foreign trade is Foreign trade. that with Russia . Russian trade. Principal exports : wool (four-fifths of total), almonds and dried fruits, cotton. Estimated value, 1904-05, £5,591. Principal imports (direct and indirect through Meshed) : sugar, kero- sine, iron, cloth, candles, tea, and matches. Estimated value, 1904-05, £32,815. British and Indian trade consists almost exclusively of imports. Principal imports (direct) : cotton yarn and British and Indian trade, twist, woollen fabrics, indigo, tea, copper plates, and spices. Estimated value, 1904-05, £9,814. The only export to India during this year was almonds, value £396. Trade with Afghanistan is on the decrease, especially since the prinei- Afghan trade. P a * comm °dity imported, viz., wool, has been intercepted at Kariz. Principal imports, 1904-05 : wool, £11,500, and ghi, £950. About £2,500 worth of general merchandise is exported yearly to Afghanistan, mainly by Afghan traders who purchase foreign goods in the lazdr. The principal local merchants are— (1) Hdji Rais-ut-Tujjdr, trading in opium, cotton, and English cloth. (2) Hdji Amin, trading in wool, opium, silk, cotton and agricul tural produce. (3) Hdji Aghd Muhammad, trading in same articles as above; also cloth made in Yazd. (4) Ibrahim Armenian, trading in wool, cotton, almond kernels, kerosine and sugar. {5) Mashhadi 'Ali Turk, trading in wool, almonds and cotton.— (Watson, 1906 ; Keyes, 1906).

It is situated in the centre of a plain sloping gently to the Jam river, from which stream it is about 1 mile distant. The vdlage, of squalid houses and dirty narrow streets with a ruinous fort, is chiefly renowned for the possession of the shrine of Shaikh Ahmad of Jam, founded by Sultan Sanjar who died in A.H. 552 (A. D 1157) which is visible for many miles. This building was once a fine piece of architecture but the exquisite mosaic work in the main archway is rapidly disappearing! This latter is the work of Shah Abbas. rr &amp; The Kazi,.a ^neal descendant of Shaikh Ahmad, is the most powerful bunm mu^tahtd in Khorasan, and is especially venerated by the Afghans. The shops are well supplied with Russian goods, tea being the only Indian produce. A caravanserai exists outside the village. Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam was formerly of much importance, but in 1825 it was plundered by AllahQull Khan of Khiva. It was subsequently owned by the late Nusrat- ul-Mulk and passed by purchase to the Shaukat-ud-Dauleh, the present chief of the Timuris, a share being reserved for the shrine. The inhabitants number some 500 families of Jamis and Heratis, and are of the Sunni sect: they possess 800 cattle and 2,000 sheep and goats. The annual production of wheat and barley amounts to 18,000 and 4,500 Indian maunds respectively.—(Orawo^y, 1894 ; H, D, Napier ; Sykes, 1905.) TURGAN— See Rudbar (River). TURGUVA— See Turuqbeh.

TURUQ— Lat. 36° 12' 21' (Lentz) \ Long. 59° 37' 0' (St. John)', Elev. 2,860' (Schindler.) A walled village in Khorasan of 500 houses, about six miles south of Meshed. It is protected by numerous towers and surrounded by abun dant cultivation, well watered by four watercourses. One of these water courses is the Chashmeh-i-Gilas, which runs through the town of Mesfced; the second is the stream from the Band-i-Turuq coming from the moun tains lying to the south-west; the third is the Ab-i-Kuh, which comes from Gulistan; the fourth comes from the Chashmeh Sar on the slopes of the mountains to the south. Turuq has a masjid and a good public bath, the property of the great shrine at Meshed. The shrine receives from Turuq a yearly rental of 12,000 Tumdns cash, 3,000 kharudrs corn and 3,00() kharwdrs straw. Two thousand kharwdrs of corn are sown here annually. The Turuq village lies at some distance from the caravanserai to the east. The camping-ground is by the caravanserai on the roadside. . The caravanserai is composed of two enclosures, called summer and winter enclosures; the latter, built by Shah Sulaiman Safavi in 1669 A.D., is 48 zar’s square, and has rooms all round the sides with stables at each corner. The outer enclosure, built in 1861, has only open arches with re cesses for sleeping in in the hot weather. A mile to the south of this caravanserai is a curious conical mound known as Tappeh-i-Nadiri. The hill is some 550 paces in circumference round the base, and 100 feet or more in height, a most unusual height for an artificial mound in this country. The mound has been dug into in various places, and the whole of the soil is full of bones and pottery from top to bottom. There are no bricks in it, but apparently round stones were used in the buildings of which it was formerly composed. It looks as if it were of great age.— (C. E. late, 1897 ; Schindler.)

In the interior is a high keep, surrounded also with a ditch, and giving a good command even over the high rampart; the outer line forming a square of about 300 yards side. At the south and north angles of the city walls are remains of detached f or t s — a sort of flanking defence. There is also a line of debris, marking the site of buildings radiating in a tolerably regular line from the central buildings. A tomb of a Rizavi Saiyid; in fairly good preservation, not far from the bridge. It is entered on its south-western side by a bridge over the Kashat Rud. The bridge is in a fair state of preservation, is 70 paces long, and has 8 arches. The bricks of the ruins are gradually being carried off by the villagers of the neighbourhood; a tower which stood close to the dome of the tomb 12 years ago has now entirely disappeared.

The name Yam is a reminiscence of the Mongolian occupation, meaning in that language “ post-house.”— {Schindler.) YAM TAPPEH— See Yam. YAMGT— A tribe of Turkomans, inhabiting, in addition to parts of Russian territory, the land south of the Atrak as far as the district of Astarabad. They number altogether about 30,000 tents or 150,000 souls. Of these 12,000 families inhabit the Atrak region, and 18,000 families* dwell on the left bank of the Oxus in Khiva territory. The Persian famil s number about 7 , 000 , of whom one-third are sedentary and the rest nomads. They are divided into the Sharif and Chuni Yamuts. The Yamut encampments extend from the coast at Gumish Tappeh, on the right bank of the northern embouchure of the Gurgan, and from Khwaja Nafas on the left bank of the southern outlet of that river, to Gumbad-i-Kabus, a distance of 80 miles from west to east. From south to north they occupy the lands on both banks of the Gur gan and Atrak rivers, and the country lying between those two streams,f which are 20 miles apart on the sea coast, and gradually diverge so as to increase the distance intervening up to the Gumbad-i-Kabus, where there are 48 miles between the two rivers. Amongst the Yamuts those tribes possessing herds of camels are called Chiimur,^. and they dwell in fixed camps. Those who possess cattle and horses and flocks are called Chdrvd§ ; they are always moving about, chang ing their camps for summer and winter, and visiting, for pasturage, locali. * * * § * For numbers in Persian territory, see remarks by Co'onel C. E. Yate. Note.— The Governor of Astarabad who is nominally iu charge of the Yamuts, pays 2,200 tumdns into the Shah’s treasury annually, on account of revenue derived from them. The Char yd pay no taxes; the Chumur l krdn or more per tent.— (Picot.) f For a description of this country and the number of families settled there, see remarks by Colonel C. E. Yate.

Yate.YAM—YAM 729 ties north of the Atrak as far as Balkan in one direction, and in the other eastward as far as Kara Kala, which is 112 miles distant from Bujnurd. The Charm keep more to the north towards the Atrak. For a con siderable part of the year they are away in the Balkan and Misrian dis tricts, and some of their camps move on towards Kiz.il Arvat and the Akhal country, but they all return during the harvest season to the Atrak and Gurgan districts, for the purpose of reaping and storing their grain. The Chumur do not quit the Gurgan lands on both banks of that river ; but some of them bring their camps quite close to the Astarabad jungle in the winter, and withdraw again to their usual localities during the summer months. The amount of revenue payable by their tribes is 2,100 iwmaus—equal to £420—annually. If the provincial administration at Astarabad were good, 5,000 tutnans might be expected without difficulty. But the fact is that the Governor is seldom in a position to enforce pay ment of even 1,000 tumans of the tribute claimed. The nomad Yamuts are constantly robbing the Guklans, who harry them in return.

To the north and north west of Gukcheh lies a low range of hills called Tapashi, extending from the Karnava range on.the east and gradually sinking into the plain on the west, beyond which is Yamut territory. According to the head of the Kan Yukhmaz {Chumur) section of Yamuts, the Yamuts do not cultivate land along the edge of the forest facing Sangar and Naudeh, because it formerly belonged to the Guklans, and the Yamuts go there only to graze. According to him the Yamut lands lie to the west of Gumbad-i-Kabus, and the Yamuts cultivate there along the banks of Gurgan. With regard to their occupation the Yamut Turkomans are divided into two classes, viz., Chumur and Charm. cultivators who form the more settled portion of the Yamuts, live more or less in permanent dhds (settlements), and pay revenue to Govern ment. The Chdrvd are the cattle-owners and nomad portion of the tribe, Cbarva are more independent and move about, and generally evade the payment of revenue even though they may cultivate some land.

Our road led north across the plain for the first 5 miles, when we Drying up of the swamp passed a pool of rain water at the foot of some south of the Atrak by diver- rising ground, and continuing along the western sion &gt;f tne water from the edge of this rise we then crossed a muddy wet southern to the northern bed . ,i ? ij-nri j i i • stretch of ground, full of low reeds and sedgy grass. This is said to have been a large swamp in 1891.It appears that when the boundary was demarcated in 1882 the Atrak flowed in the southern bed, and the northern bed was dry, as entered in the frontier map, sheet No. 1, where it is shown as disconnected both with the Atrak and the Caspian. The southern bed of the river at that time, from what I can gather, was one huge swamp, as the actual channel of the river was far too small to carry off the whole volume of the water, and the ground to the south of it was largely inundated. About the year 1892 the Russians are said to have dug a channel connecting the northern with the southern bed, and to have constructed a dam across the latter at Gudri (S. W. A., sheet No. 84), and by these means to have turned the whole of the water of the river, except when in flood, round to the north of the rise, marked Hauteurs Ghondr-i-Tepe on the frontier map (sheet No. 11 ), into the northern channel. On the con struction of the Russian dam and the diversion of the water into the northern channel the swamp dried up. The inundation of the land south-west of the Atrak river by the river water overrunning its banks, and thus gradual ly finding its way down to the sea, may account for the saltness of the soil. The whole coun try is now one vast waste, but the grazing must be excellent in summer. The water of the Atrak is said to have decreased in volume considerably of late years, and in summer there is very little water in the southern bed, which may be the cause of its extra saltness. On account of the saltness of the soil, land on the southern bank of the Atrak river is said to be unfit for cultivation. It can be cultivated once, but never a second time, and rain crops like those on the Gurgan are an impossibility under any circumstances. All cultivation, wherever it is, north or south of the river, must be irrigated, and former reports regarding the fertility of the soil on the Atrak were ap parently wrong. The Ak Atek Bais and others on the northern bank cultivate what land they can every year by canals drawn from the Atrak, and owing to the heat of the climate the crops, as a rule, are nearly ripe before Land south of the Atrak un fit for cultivation on account of its saltness.

The people, however, seem to be more graziers than cultivators, even although they are Chumur. In the winter the grazing is best to the north, and the Persian Ateh Bais take their cattle there to graze.734 YAM—YAM Grazing fees levied by Rus sians. Grazing best to south of Atrak in summer. Ak Ateh Bals. Persians unable to levy graz ing tax south of Atrak. For this they are taxed at the rate of 6 roubles per aldchuq, the same as Russian subjects. In the summer the grazing is best to the south, and the Ak Ateh Bais on the north bank, who only number some 50 families all told, then move across to the south bank, but of course pay no grazing tax, as the Persians are unable to levy it. It was generally supposed that the south bank of tne lower Atrak was thickly populated by Persian Yamuts, but this is not actually the case. In the whole march from the Gurgan to the Atrak I only saw one small did, about a farsakh from the Gurgan. These were camel-owners, and their camels were grazing about, and they drew their water from the Gurgan. I saw no sign of the 2,500 Ak Ateh Bal tents described on the map (S. W. A. sheet No. 84) as wintering in this region, and the Ateh Bai and Ak Ateh Bai in Persian territory all told only number some 350 families, of whom the Ak Ateh Bai are under one hundred and are all on the Gurgan. Practically speaking the tract between the two rivers is uninhabited. So far as I can gather, of late years there have been hardly any Persian settlements on the southern bank of the lower Atrak. Years ago when the Ateh Bais and Ak Ateh Bais were both here, they quarrelled over the land, and it was finally decided that the Ak Aieh Bais should hold the land to the north of the river and the Atoh Bais that to the south. Some time after that, the Ateh Bai Chart'd, to the number of something like 1,000 families, moved off to Balkan in Russian territory where they still are. They are great camel-owners, and the grazing here did not suffice for them. Since then the southern bank has practically remained untenanted. At the present moment there are only about 20 families of Persian Ateh Bai all told on the southern bank, viz., one small 5bd at Tangli and another under Shaikh Nazar, 3 miles to the west of it. Absence of a representative of Persian Government on the lower Atrak frontier. The Persian Government have no represen tative on the frontier, and neither the Gov ernor of Astarabad nor^any of his men that I know of dar 3 go there. The Persian local officers are thus able to take advantage of the situation and do as they like, and if the local tax-collector, anxious to enhance his receipts, taxes the Persian subjects at the same time that he does the Rus sians there, there is no one to say him nay.

Our road led through a dried up swamp the whole way, and our camp on the telegraph line is still amongst dry reeds.

The river Kara Su, 5 miles from Oba-i-’Aneh Khan Ja’afarbai, forms the limit of the Yamut country north-west of the town of Astarabad. The Ja’afarbai in Persian territory are said to number 3,000 families. Of these about 500 are Chart'd and are located on the right bank of the Gurgan within a radius of 8 or 10 miles from the river; of the Chumur, some 50 families are said to have settled at a place lately left dry by the sea called Tazehabad, about 3 farsalchs to the north of Gumish Tappeh, but with that excep- Kara Su river.

Revenue paid by Yamuts The CJiumur pay on an average, it is said, to Persian Government. about 12 krdns revenue per family per annum.* The Charvd give horses, etc., and do not pay in cash. So far as I can gather, the Kan Yukhmaz and Igdar sections pay no revenue now to the Persian Government. , The Kan Yukhmaz CJiumur used to pay 3 Jcrdns per family per annum, but even that is not paid now as they have very little cultivation. The Chumur of the Badrak sub-section of the Diaji section pay revenue, a lump sum of 500 tumdns. The Ghana of that section pay nothing as usual. The annual payment was formerly fixed at 300 tumdns, but it is said to have been raised to 500 tumdns this year. The Sangar and Naudeh villagers send their flocks and herds to graze Blackmail paid by Persian in the plain during the winter and spring, and villages of Sangar and Naudeh for this they have to pay 1 krdn per head of to Yamuts. cattle and half the wool of the sheep. The chief of the Chumur of the Kan Yukhmaz section of the Yamuts in addition gets an annual payment of 50 Ithancdrs of rice from each village, and in return for this he is bound to protect them and to make good any losses they may suffer at the hands of Yamut raiders. Kurds and Turks only fi fc The Kurds and Turks are the only people to be trusted against Turko- that I have seen as yet who are fit to be trusted mans. against Turkomans. The Chdrvd Yamuts are generally supposed to be responsible for all the raids in neighbouring districts, but the Chumur as well as the Persian subjects of the Astarabad frontier districts are just as ready as the Chdrvd to harry their neighbours. Travelling from east to west we have now gone through three distinct Different varieties of the varieties of the Yamut Turkoman race; first Yamut Turkoman race. came the wild, lawless and poor Chdrvd or graziers round Gumbad-i-Kabus. These people were poorly dressed, and had nothing but bare necessaries in their kibitka (tents), such as bedding * Picot puts it down at 15 krdns or more per family.and an iron cooking-pan. Next we came to the cultivating Chumur amongst the Daz and Diaji opposite Fidarisk and Katul, where the people were better off. I have noticed the prevalence of fair complexions and light eyes. ^ Finally we have now arrived amongst the Ja’afarbai Chumur, the sailors, fishermen, and traders of the tribe. These are the best off of all. Their kibitka (tents) are well and even luxuriantly furnished; the women are well dressed and covered with silver ornaments, and they and the children are mostly fair complexioned. The men, as a rule, seem well-to-do. All look comfortably off, wear cloth clothes, and many of them are even dressed in fur-lined overcoats. The majority of the traders speak Persian, play chess and show other signs of civilisation. They keep their own accounts, and even have a school for their children, and in fact, remind me of nothing so much as of a Bora settlement from Karachi or Bombay. Raids and thefts by all accounts are here unknovm, and peace and security apparently prevail. We no longer find every man armed with a rifle as we have hitherto seen them. Like all other Yamilts, however, they acknowledge no authority. There Intor-tribal feuds and want is no headman in the place, cr any one whose of central authority. authority is obeyed. . ^e Ja ofarbai at Garnish Tap pc h are, like all the rest of the Yamuts, suffer ing from the want of some strong central authority, and they even acknow ledge the want of this themselves. I had thought that the Yan uts all held together and were not sub-divid ed by inter-tribal jealousies; but this, I find, is not the case. The Igdar and Kan Yukhmaz sections are on friendly terms but both decline to go into the district of the Kujuks, the next section to the west, with whom they have a feud ; not a man dares to move from his eba to the next without his rifle, and every man is armed with a Berdan. According to the chief of the Kujuk Chumur, the Yamuts quarrel amongst themselves, because they have no chief to keep the various sec tions under control. This is doubtless true, as, there being no superior to appeal to, every body has to take the law into his own hands. So far as I can gather, the Yamuts are themselves- beginning to get tired of inter-tribal feuds, and the majority would now welcome any settled government which could control the various sections and protect the peopie from the consequences of everlasting reprisals. All the Yamuts, Charm, as well as Chumur, appear to me to be cultiva tors more or less; even the wildest of the Chdrvd cultivate some land and they only require a firm and just government to give employment to, and tnus gradually check the lawlessness of the wilder narties amongst them to render the whole tribe jjeaeeable subjects.738 YAM—YAM The Yamflts treat their Khwdjas or Saiyids with great respect, and should they by any chance happen to raid the Yamut respect for Saiyids. - * 1 1 1 : — •*-- buuuiu. y vj r jl ^ x - - sheep or camels belonging to the latter they always restore them to the owners on finding out their mistake, and make good any losses from their own property. The fact that the Turkomans should show such respect to their Khwdjas or Saiyids is a curious one. It emanates apparently from dread, as stories are told of the calamities that have overtaken men who had stolen Khicdjas 1 property and refused to return it, and had thus incurred the wrath or curse of the owners. Yamut religiousness, utmost regularity. The Yamuts profess to be religiously inclined, and most of them say their prayers with the Yamfit hospitality. The Yamhts, so far as I can gather, have a high respect for the bonds of hospitality, however much they may rob abroad, and I believe it would be foreign to their nature to harm, in any way, a stranger within their doors. ^ They are said to be upright in their dealings.

Of these the Karguzar of Bujnurd estimated the lawless characters at only 300, and the chief of Bujnurd, from whom he got the information, having himself been Governor of the Yamuts, ought to know something about them. Personally I think this a fair estimate, and were all these 300 men given regular service under a competent governor, I see no reason why they should not be controlled without much difficulty. No Persian troops that I have seen are fit to be trusted with the garri soning of Turkoman country. Those at Ak Kaleh are said to be practically prisoners within the walls of their post, and they cannot even ensure the safety of their communications with Astarabad, although within sight of it. The Persian Government have already enlisted Yamut Turkoman levies. . The Diaji have a service of 50 savars. amut evies. The Khan of the Daz section has a service of 60 savars with three Yuzbashls under him, and each savdr receives 20 tumdns per annum as pay from the Persian Government.' Aneh Khan Ja’afarbai has the rank of (Colonel) from the Persian Government and a service of 50 savdrs, who are supposed to get 22 £ tumdns each per annum, but this they do not seem to get. The employment of Turkoman levy savdrs by the Persian Government is a step in the right direction, but even this is of no use so long as they have not a governor who can control the levies.— (C. E.

ZA’AFARANLtJ— A tribe of Khorasan Kurds, who were expatriated with the Shadillu, Kaivanlu, and ’Amarlu tribes about 1,600 A.D. by the vazir of Shah ’Abbas of the Safavian dynasty. They occupied Chinaran, a fertile tract with fine pastures, at the head of the Kashaf Rud, the stream draining the plain at Meshed and Kuchan in the plain at the head of the Atrak. Those of Chinaran have since lost all political existence, and their chiefs all influence-. Famine, reckless rebellion and misgovernment have reduced their numbers, and ruined their fortunes. Such of the class as remain look to the chief of Kuchan as their leader. The Za’afaianlu of Kuchan, more favoured by fortune and possessing a more fertile country, have increased in influence, numbers, and wealth, and take the full lead of all the other tribes. The mas* of the population of Kuchan are Za’afaranlu Kurds, who may be estimated at about four-fifths of the whole. There are from 2,000 fo 3,000 tents of the nomads of the Za’afaranlu and ’Amarlu tribes—moving for the most part about the skirts of the plain and in the southern mountains. The Za’afaianlu at the time of their first settlement had, according to their traditions, 24,000 families, or about 120,000 souls. If so, they must have decreased much in numbers ; for at the highest estimate they cannot have now more than half that number. The Za’afaranlu are a fine, robust race,—men of good stature and stout, with unusually fair complexions as compared with the people of toher parts. They appeared invariably well fed and clothed, says Napier; and their vil lages are neatly built, clean, and enlivened by troops of children of all ages— an unusual sight. They bear a high character for courage ; and are always civil, hospitable, and honest in their dealings. Their independent, manfy ‘ bearing marked them as superior to the inhabitants of the southern districts, and is also an evidence of their prosperous condition. They have now enjoyed almost uninterrupted peace for over thirty years. The villagers of the northern mountains only are liable to molestation from the Turko mans ; and even there the natural strength of the country is such that they are more usually the assailants than the assailed, and are able to maintain themselves successfully at many points only a few miles from large settlements of the Turkomans. The feelings of feudal attachment to their chief and of tribal union are more marked among the Za’afaranlu than among the Shadillu—a efreum-’ 5 B 2743 ZAB-ZAI stance attributable, I believe, to their superior material condition and to the personal character of the chiefs.-; Stewart.) For further information about the Za’afaianlu tribe and the history of the family of their chief, see Kuchan (district). ZABAR KHAN— A sub-division of Nishapur, with a population of 8,000 souls and an estimated revenue of 3,000 iumdns.
