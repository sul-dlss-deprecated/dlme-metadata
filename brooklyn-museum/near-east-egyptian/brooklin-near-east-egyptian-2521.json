Two handles joining rim with body. Neck and handles pale green translucent glass, while body appears to be dark brown opaque glass, but this may be due to substance on interior. Four registers of etched decorations. \r\nCondition:The entire vase is light green and of fine quality. Three grains of barley were found in the substance adhering to the interior (sample saved). The body is rather badly cracked and the center of the base was missing. A piece of new glass was cut to fit this missing section and was then shellacked to blend with the old glass. \r\nThe decorations are crudely cut and the pattern does not appear either Classical or Coptic.", "medium": "Glass", "dimensions": "11 7/8 x Diam. 3 15/16 in.
