Sir, United Nations Appeal for Children have to bring to your notice a speech which I made at the T an f\° n House on 20th February last, at a luncheon given by the Lord Mayor to the editors of all the national papers in connexion with the United Nations Appeal for Children. The text of this speech has already been circulated in the General (Public Statements) Series. 2. [The United Nations Appeal for Children is the development o a suggestion made by the Norwegian Delegate to the United Nations that everyone, the world over, should be asked to con tribute one day's pay to meet the needs of children in war-devastated countries, following the termination of U.N.R.R.A. relief. 3. In March 1947, the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations approved the principle of a world-wide appeal for voluntary contributions to meet the emergency relief needs of children, adolescents, expectant and nursing mothers without iscnmmation because of race, creed, nationality, status or political belief. The Appeal is to be a united effort by all peoples of the world, to help those millions of children, and adolescents and mothers who are in urgent need of food, clothing and medical care. 4. National Committees have already been set up in a number of countries and at my request the Lord Mayor of London has agreed to initiate a Lord Mayor’s Appeal. The campaign is now ■ '‘A His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers 14611 35001—232 under weigh and will reach its climax on 25th April, with a house-to- house collection. It has been decided that at least 50 per cent, of the proceeds of the Appeal will be given to the International Children’s Emergency Fund, 10 per cent, to U.N.E.S.C.O. in its work for educational reconstruction in devastated countries, 20 per cent, to British Voluntary Societies working abroad, and 20 per cent, is reserved for children at home and abroad. 5. His Majesty’s Government have decided that when the Lord Mayor’s Appeal has reached the sum of £500,000, they will give £50,000 to the Appeal and £50,000 to the International Children’s Emergency Fund. 6. I shall be glad if you would make the most in conversation and on all appropriate occasions of this practical evidence of our eagerness to help the children of the world despite our present difficulties^ You may care to consider the suggestion that local British communities might wish to raise subscriptions. 7. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty's Representatives (as No. 050). I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN. fGENERAL (PUBLIC STATEMENTS) February 20, 1948 Section 1 Enclosure SPEECH BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AT MANSION HOUSE ON 20th FEBRUARY, 1948, IN CONNEXION WITH UNITED NATIONS APPEAL FOR CHILDREN My Lord Mayor, I want first of all to thank you most sincerely for undertaking this onerous task. This problem of dealing with children, which is really the result of the upsets and the dislocation of the war, is a vital thing for the future peace of the world. After all, those of us who were engaged in the quarrel, we shall pass out; and what we want to do is to create, not merely a United Nations feeling but a universal feeling of comradeship to take its place. Now, the United Nations and a good many friends associated with it have been alarmed at the position of the rising generation throughout the world. This is not purely a European problem; it is a universal problem. It affects China; it affects the East as well as the West. Now, bound up with the question of the children is first of all the problem of diseases. Tuberculosis has increased enormously. This is one great fight, and we know from our history of tuberculosis in this country that it is largely a question of nutrition, particularly in the very early stages, or in the very early period of life. The second point is the question of rickets. Here, again, there is a proneness to disease and once this proneness has developed it is very difficult to cure in after fife. The United Nations thought that however much they themselves might have a row and fail to agree they ought not to interfere with the .creation of a strong, healthy humanity for the coming genera tion. Therefore this appeal was launched. Now we feel very strongly that this ques tion of child welfare needs to be brought down to the thought and action of indivi duals all over the world. There is one reason why this is particularly appropriate. There is a greater child consciousness now than there has ever been in the history of the world. In this country now—if we may take our own country as a sample— directly you hear of the ill-treatment of a child or directly you hear of starvation, one of the most glorious things is that the whole national conscience responds immediately. I think this is a tremendous advance. The value placed on child life has developed many thousands per cent, since those of my age were born, and everywhere an aware ness of the sacredness of life and health has become more general. Therefore I want Great Britain, and the Commonwealth who are responding very well, who have developed this great child consciousness, not only to apply it to their own race but to apply it universally. I think that this would be of tremendous advantage. I won’t go into a lot of lurid statistics of the suffering, about which I think you know, but I think it is quite obvious that the terrific bombing, the tremendous devas tation, the destruction of houses, the retar dation of the development of hospitals and health services and all the rest of it must have made the task extremely difficult. The main thing I want to emphasise is thajt we must act quickly to free particularly tnose under 16 years of age from diseases of all kinds. A diseased body may lead to a diseased mentality; a diseased mentality may lead to disastrous results in the years to come; and as healthy a community as we can get is of vital importance. Now there are some things which have occurred for which we must be grateful. I think that one of the greatest works which have been done since the war has been the work of U.N.R.R.A., and I wish somehow that you, dear pressmen, could depict rather more dramatically what U.N.R.R.A. has done. This economic crisis would have been on us sooner but for U.N.R.R.A., and the suffering it saved at that particular moment is inestimable. No one can place a value on it. I am glad our country made their contribution in proportion to their national wealth. One thing that strikes me about the United States—whatever you may think about business, commerce, politics or anything else—is that there is something in that great country which is so humanistic that They will respond to world needs with tremendous enthusiasm. Their contribution to U.N.R.R.A. has never been recognised or appreciated as it ought to have been. Now that is ended. Since then the United States have come along and 14611—1 111—114made a substantial appropriation and said, —which I think they are perfectly entitled to do—that their appropriation will be determined and expended in proportion to the gifts of other people. In the light of this, I was asked in the House of Commons this week, “ What are we going to do? ” Although, my Lord Mayor, Britain is in a very difficult position, and I do not under estimate it, it is very difficult for us to give our money when we restrict our people. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that when you have raised £500,000 in this country, he will allocate £100,000, and the praportions of this which will go to your fund and to I.C.E.F.—thus bringing a greater gift from America—will be worked out between us. I am glad to say that throughout the world there is a great response to this fund. Perhaps it is one basis upon which we can unite and succeed in saying to the rising generation: “In spite of political difficulties, at least we looked after you. May this result in a long-standing peace ! 5 ’ Now I give you the practical side. You may quote me as saying : I appeal to my trade union friends. It is a thing which I was glad to hear from the Lord Mayor, that the Trades Union Congress had whole heartedly co-operated with the appeal. I would like to see works’ collections as we had in tie war for the Red Cross. I am sure I know the workpeople well. If they are asked to contribute 2d. or 3d. per week they will respond; to help the children of the world they will respond with alacrity. They like to give, and what they like is to be asked to agree to do it universally, right throughout the great industries in the country, whether in farm, field or factory. I want to appeal to my f riends in the work shops. the fields, the factories and the mines, to the men whose heart is always sound in a good cause, to come along; and having appealed to them, I would appeal next to the teachers in the schools. I want to ask them to help us. These kiddies going to school like to think they are helping some other children. Notwith standing our difficulties I am glad this old country of ours has put mrlk and feeding in the schools in the forefront of our pro gramme, without political distinction. I do not believe any party will quarrel about providing meals in schools or giving milk to build up strong bodies, and I think that there is a national opinion about this with out division. Now this country, in all its extremities and with all its difficulties, has done what it can for the rising generation, and I say to the parents and the teachers of the children : Bring them into co-opera tion behind you, my Lord Mayor, and let every school have its target and let everyone do their best. To those who are better off with the world’s goods and who live in terrific fear of the Chancellor swooping down, I say to them : Relieve your night mare by giving to this Children’s Fund and sleep in peace as a result. So the com munity as a whole, Lord Mayor, I hope, will be behind you and with a great heart. It is an astonishing thing, and I will conclude with this, that as I sit in the Foreign Office considering how we politi cians and statesmen somehow find things to quarrel about and find it devilishly difficult to agree, I look out of the window and see many people of many nationalities walking up and down in the park. These people do not quarrel at all. Why do we? The ordinary people of the world—they have no quarrel, they do not want war, but one thing they do want is clothes, food, shelter, medical services, and trade; and you, my Lord Mayor, in undertaking this task at my request, are rendering one of the greatest services there has ever been. I hope that the co-operation of the press and the B.B.C. and television may also result in bringing resources to this great fund.D.O.

This economic crisis would have been on us sooner but for U.N.R.R.Ao, and^the suffering it saved at that particular moment is inestimable. No one can place a value on it. I am glad our country made their contribution in proportion to their national wealth. One thing that strikes me about the United States - whatever you may think about business, commerce, politics or anything else - is that there is something in that great country which is so humanistic that they will respond to world needs with tremendous enthusiasm. Their contribution to U.N.R.R.A. has never been recognised or appreciated as it ought to have been. Nov/ that is ended. Since then the United States have come along and made a substantial appropriation and said, - which I think they are perfectly entitled to do - that their appropriation will be determined and expended in proportion to the gifts of other people. In the light of this, I was asked in the House of Commons this week, 'What are we going to do?' Although, my Lord Mayor, Britain is in a very difficult position, and I do not under-estimate it, it is very difficult for us to give our money when we restrict our people. The The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed that when you have raised £500,000^111 this country, he will allocate £100,000, and the proportions of this which will go to your fund and to I.C.E.F. - thus bringing a greater gift from America - will be worked out between us. I am glad to say that throughout the world there is a great response to this fund. Perhaps it is one basis upon which we can unite and succeed in saying to the rising generation; 'In spite of political difficulties, at least we looked after you. May this result in a long standing peace!' _Now I give you the practical side. You may quote me as saying; I appeal to my trade union friends. It is a thing which I was glad to hear from the Lord Mayor, that the Trades Union Congress had wholeheartedly co-operated with the appeal. I would like to see v/orks 1 collections as we had In the war for the Red Cross. I am sure I know the workpeople well. If they are asked to contribute 2d. or 3d. per*week they will respond; to help the children of the world they will respond with alacrity. They like^to give, and what they like,is to be asked to agree to do it universally, right throughout the great industries in the country, whether in farm, field or factory, ^ant.to appeal to ^my friends in the workshops, the fields, the tactories and the mines, to the men whose heart is always sound in a good cause, to come along; and having appealed to them, 1 would appeal next to the teachers in the schools. I want to a J^k them to help us. These kiddies going to school like thTi?h t T?L are T helpi ? g 3 s ?i? e other chii( 3ren. Notwithstanding • °\n difficulties I am glad this old country of ours has put milk and feeding in the schools in the forefront of our pro gramme , withou t political distinction. T do not believe any party wil! quarrel about providing meals in schools or giving milk to build up strong bodies, and I think that there is a na tional opinion about this without division. Now this country in allo ” o - in all its extremities and with all its difficulties, has done what it can for the rising generation, and I say to the parents and the teachers of the childrens Bring them into co-operation behind you, my Lord Mayor, and let every school have its target and let everyone do their best. To those who are better off with the world's goods and who live in terrific fear of the Chancellor swooping down, I say 'to them; Relieve your nightmare by giving to this Children's Fund and sleep in peace as a result. So the community as a whole, Lord Mayor, I hope, wall be behind you and with a great heart. It is an astonishing thing, and I will conclude with this, that^as I sit in the Foreign Office considering how we politicians and statesmen somehow find things to quarrel about and find it devilishly difficult to agree, I look out of the window and see many people of many nationalities walk ing up and down in the park. These people do not quarrel at all. Why do we? The ordinary people of the world - they have no quarrel, they do not want war, but one thing they do want is clothes, food, shelter, medical services, and trade; •and you, my Lord Mayor, in undertaking this task at my re quest, are rendering one of the greatest services there has ever been. I hope that the co-operation of the press and the BoB.C. and television may also result in bringing resources to this great fund.*CIRCULAI 1th May, 1948. ^ Sir, United Nations Appeal for Children ^ I have to refer to my circular No. 21 about the United Nations Appeal for Children, and to say, with reference to para graph 5, that at the suggestion of the Lord Mayor’s Appeal Committee it has now been decided that when the Lord Mayor’s Appeal has reached the sum of £500,000, His Majesty’s Government will give £100,000 to the International Children’s Emergency Fund, so that a larger matching contribution may be attracted from the United States Government. 2.

The information asked for:- 1) appears to be contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Foreign Office circular No. 050, dated the 31st March, 1948. The fund will be administered by the U.N.O or a body set up by it. 2) 20$ is reserved for British children at home or abroad who are thus likely to benifit in two ways; from the International Children’s Emergency Fund and the 20$, the latter being administered by a British Committee.

A meeting was held at the Agency at 6.00 p.m. on Monday the 24th May to consider means for raising subscriptions for the Lord Mayor’s Fund started in response to the United Nations Appeal for Children, the Political Agent presiding. The following were present: Mr. B. Crow Mr. B.H. Lermitte Mr. R.M. Brown Mr, G.A. Calver Mr. J.R. Allison Mr. C.E. Gahan Mr. P.D. Buckland Mr. A,J. Hemelik. 2. The Political Agent explained the purpose of the meeting and that the appeal was a personal one not being made to organisations as such. 3. Mr. Crow’s view coincided with one suggestion of the Political Agent for raising funds namely that a circular letter should be addressed to individual British subjects and (at Mr. Crow’s suggestion) to American citizens inviting subscriptions while lists would be opened by each organisation. The circular would be signed by the Political Agent. This suggestion was approved by all and the Political Agent said that he would draft a circular. 4. Mr. Crow said that he would have to consider the Political Agent’s suggestion that lists of subs cribers should be published in the ’’Bahrain Islander”. Mr. Brown was opposed to publication of the names of individual subscribers and the ultimate feeling of the meeting was that subscriptions should be handed in as from organisations e.g. ’’From the European employees of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd.”I 5 Mr. Lermitte agreed that British and American employees of his Company in Qatar should be approached. of an indication in the circular as to the amount of subscription expected. 'A day’s pay” as suggested by the Norwegian delegate at the United Nations was mentioned. The Political Agent pointed out that if even an average of Rs.5/- were subscribed by every British subject, a sum of between £200 and £300 might be expected. 7. The Political Agent mentioned that he himself would subscribe Rs.lOC/-. 8. As regards paragraph 4, it was ultimately sug gested that only the aggregate amounts subscribed to 6 There was some discussion regarding the giving the fund should be published in the 'Bahrain Islander” provided that BAPCO could see its way to permit this.Directors: G.

Dear The Lord Mayor of London has initiated an appeal for funds to help the millions of children and adolescents and mothers who are in urgent need of food, clothing and medical care all over the world; and I am, at the request of His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, raising subscriptions locally. Would you be good enough to contribute? 2.

A number of countries have set up committees to raise funds in response to the United Nations Appeal; the Lord Mayor's Appeal is England's method of doing so. This letter is, therefore, addressed primarily to British subjects in this Agency but also to citizens ef the United States in Bahrein who have in the past given generously to such charitable appeals as have been made locally. 4.

A meeting was held at the Agency at 6.00 p.m. on Monday the 24th May to consider means for raising subscriptions for the Lord Mayor*s Fund started in response to the United Nations Appeal for Children, the Political Agent presiding. The following were presents Mr. B. Crow Mr. B.K. Lermitte Mr. R.M. Brown Mr. 0.A. Culver Mr. J.R. Allison Mr. C.E* Oahan Mr. P.D. Buckland Mr. A.J. Hemellk. 2. The Political Agent explained the purpose of the meeting and that the appeal was a personal one not being made to organisations as such. 3. Mr. Crow’s view coincided with one suggestion of the Political Agent for raising funds namely that a circular letter should be addressed to Individual British subjects and (at Mr. Crow’s suggestion) to American citizens inviting subscriptions while lists would be opened by each organisation. The circular would be signed by the Political Agent. This suggestion was approved by all and the Political Agent said that he would draft a circular. 4. Mr. Crow said th^t he would have to consider the Political Agent’s suggestion that lists of subs cribers should be published in the 'Bahrain Islander'. Mr. Brown was opposed to publication of the names of individual subscribers and the ultimate feeling of the meeting was that subscriptions should be handed in as from organisations e.g. 'From the European employees of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd.'o. Mr. Lermitre agreed th^t British and American employees of hi a Company In Qatar should be approached. 6. There was some discussion regarding the giving of an indication in the circular as to the amount of subscription expected. 'A day*s pay' as suggested by the Norwegian delegate at the United Nations was men tioned. The Political Agent pointed out that if even ar average of Rs.6/«* were subscribed by every British subject, a sum of between £200 and £300 might be expected. 7. The Political Agent mentioned that he himself would subscribe Bs.100/-. S. As regards paragraph 4, it was ultimately suggested that only the aggregate amounts subscribed to the fund i should be published In the 'Bahrain Islander' provided that BAPCO could see its way to permit this.His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, The Agency, Manama.

The following were presents Mr. B. Crow Mr. B.K. Lermitte Mr. R.M. Brown Mr. G.A. Calver Mr. J.R. Allison Mr. C.E. Gahsn Mr. P.D. Buckland Mr. A.J. Hemelik. 2. The Political Agent explained the purpose of the meeting and that the appeal was a personal one not being made to organisations as such. 3. Mr. Crow’s view coincided with one suggestion of the Political Agent for raising funds namely that a circular letter should be addressed to individual British subjects and (at Mr. Crow’s suggestion) to American citizens inviting subscriptions while lists would be opened by each organisation. The circular would be signed by the Political Agent. This suggestion was approved by all and the Political Agent said that he would draft a circular. 4. Mr. Crow said that he would have to consider the Political Agent’s su gestion that lists of subs cribers should be published in the 'Bahrain Islander'. Mr. Brown was opposed to publication of the names of individual subscribers and the ultimate feeling of the meeting was that subscriptions should be handed in as i * from organisations e.g. 'From the European employees of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd.'5. Mr, Leriaitte agreed that British aid American i employees of his Company in star ^hould be approached. €• There was some discussion regarding the giving of an indication in the circular ©s to the amount of subscription expected. U A day's pay” as suggested by the Norwegian delegate at the United Nations was men tioned. The Political Agent pointed out that if even an average of Rs.5/- were subscribed by every British i / subject, a sum of between f£00 and £300 might be expected. 7. The Political Agent mentioned that he himself would subscribe Rs.lOG/-. 8. As regards paragraph 4, it was ultimately suggested that only the aggregate amounts subscribed to the fund should be published in the •Bahrain Islander” provided that BAPCO could see its way to permit this.i ( UNITED NATIONS APPEAL FOR CHILDREN .
