Shaikh Ahmad bin Kilal and Ahmad bin Khalaf bin ’Utaibah, returned from Abu Dhabi on Thursday the 3rd December 1936. They remained 12 days at Abu Dhabi trying their best for the settlement of the dispute and it was with great difriculty that they made Shaikh Shakhbut accept a proposal according to which the boundary line would run from Hasat Um-al-Jibajib which is about 10 miles from Jabal *Ali. Shaikh Sa'id bin Hu Maktuin,0.B.E., Auler of Dubai summoned all notables of A Albu Falasah and inforwd them of the peace proposal^ The Albu Falasah agreed that the peace xjroposals should be accepted with slight modification, namely, that the boundary line should run from Bandar Hisyaiyan which is about three mile from Hasat urn al Jibajib or 13 miles west of Jabal *Ali. The object of asking for the boundary line to run from Bandar Hisaiyan, is to allow the Dubai people a shelter for their boats near Jabal 'All. Residency Agent,Sharjah.€&gt; C/ll-10/12.

BAHRAIN Dated the 27th February 2037 i I It is very important to know tne exact position of SUFUK wells. You will remember that in our discussion with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan in November 1935 we were told that Sufuk was a term meaning the line where hilly country merges in the salt marsh of sabakhah and that Sufuk in question ran south from the sea on the west side of the Sabakhat al Matti; and also that about ten miles from the i sea there were wells known as Sufuk, where travellers water on the road to Abu Dhabi before crossing the Sabakhat al Matti. j 2. I propose to make an aerial reconnaissance on the .4th March &gt; and to fly over the above area about 09-.00 or 10.00 hours (English time) on the morning of the 4th. Please arrange with Shaikh Shakhbut for a very reliable man, who personally knows Sufuk wells to go there and to peg out flat on the ground near to the wells a sheet of white cotton cloth thirty yards long by ten yards broad (please buy the — necessary ctyh). He should also light a fire at 09.00 hours (or before if he sees or hears the aeroplane) on the highest point of ground near to the white sheet and make it give out plenty of smoke. Then the aeroplane will first from far away see the smoke and will then come to (Signatw e) look for the ( Designation) S. 44.

If it is a day 7 /ith a sandstorm, so that nothing can be seen, it may be necessary to come on the next morning, the 5th March, but we shall not postpone the flight unless it is absolutely necessary. 4. It is possible that you may be able to telegraph to me from Abu Dhabi through the Geologists’ wireless; otherwise please send a special messenger to Sharjah Radio by car to inform me whether you have been able to make the necessary arrangements and in particular whether the Shaikh’s representative can reach Sufuk wells in time to be ready on the early morning of the 4th March. 5. There is no objection to your going with the Shaikh’s man if you find that it is desirable for you to do so. Please state in your telegram whether you are going. 6. After the Shaikh’s man has seen the aeroplane circle round the wells he can return to Abu Dhabi. 7. For your personal information there will be with me a representative of the Foreign Office in London and probably the Honourable the Political Resident. 8. Please impress on Shaikh Shakhbut and Shaikh Khalifah that it is very important from their point of view that we should know exactly where Sufuk wells are in order that we may be in a position to know whether we can support his claim to them. Indeed, if he makes any difficulty, you can emphasise that it will be very difficult for us to support his claim with success unless we are in a position to say that we know exactly where the wells are. You should take your code book with you so that you can use it either for messages through the Geologists’ -wireless or if you send back messages to be sent through the Sharjah wireless.% ^ 3 ~ 10, Any reasonable expenses will be met. 11.

As soon as^arrived at Abu Dhabi, I arranged with the Shaikh for a reliable person to go to Sufuk(Safq). The Shaikh s^gi that it was ne necessary that two men shoul^o on good camels, but as all the Abu Dhabi camels were out grazing,it was not possible to send the men before third March and that it would take them at least seven days to reach Sufuk. I then tried to send the men by launch to Sal* but there were no launches available except that of Ahmad bin Khalaf which was on th&lt; beach and she could not be ready to sail before 12 p.m. on Tuesday night. I asked the Shaikh’s man whether he couf^ reach in time on 4th March and he said that it was impossible to arrive there before Friday the 5th March. As he could not possibly reach Safuk before Firday, I thought that it would be better not to send him but to keep him ready at Abu Dhabi in case you may like to take him by aeroplane to show r you the place which he said he was willing to do* The man, Muhammad bin Hulaibah, is now at Abu Dhabi and I have arrnged with the Shaikh to send him to the landing ground as soon as the aeroplane is sighted as you might go there to take him.

He suggested that Shaikh Sa«id and Shaikh Shakhbut should meet at Ras Ghurabi which is about 20 miles north east of Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Sa»id asked that both should meet at Khaur Ghanadhah, but Ahmad bin Khalaf was able to convince him to go to Khaur Ghurabi. As Shaikh Sa»id accepted the proposal, a let-Ler was sent this morning asking Shaikh Shakhbut to come to Khaur Ghurabi and then inform them so that Shaikh Sa 1 id may proceed to Khaur Ghurabi by launch and will be accompanied by Ahmad bin Khalaf who will remain in Dubai until a reply is received while Ahmad bin Hilal will accompany Shaikh Shakhbut from Abu Dhabi• Ahmad bin Hilal is now at Abu Dhabi.

Dear Hay, In view of our forthcoming assumption of responsibility of the Persian Gulf we have been looking at the question of the possible settlement of frontier disputes between the various Trucial Sheikhdoms and the problem of enforcing any decision which may be reached. In this connexion we have seen your letter to Donaldson No.D.O.1040-S of the 30th May, 1947 and Galloway’s express letter to the India Office NO.1400-S of the 29th July, 1947. With the growing interest in oil development on the Trucial Coast it certainly seems desirable, if it is at all possible, to settle the frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and the frontiers between certain of them and Muscat; and any definition of the lateral boundaries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms would also assist us should it at some time be necessary to divide up the Continental Shelf of the Persian Gulf. The difficulties of course, are great and there is the added complication that we do not want to stir up the question of frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and Saudi Arabia if it can be avoided. We should much appreciate it if you could let us have your appreciation of the whole problem, including the question of enforcement. My preliminary feeling about title latter question is that however desirable it might be to have some kind of local force as in Aden, this would presumably cost money and that in our present financial circumstances it would probably be very difficult indeed to obtain sanction for the expenditure. I am sending a copy of this letter to Trott. Yours ever, (SGD) B.A.B. BURROWS. Sir Rupert Hay KCIE, CSI, Bahrain. CONFIDENTI AL. PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, No,692-S ''v Dated 31st March, 948.

As far as I am aware there is no active dispute about the boundaries between Muscat and Has al Khaimah or Muscat and Kalba. The limit of Muscat’s jurisdiction in the Wadi el Qaur was described in the enclosure to my printed letter No*C/163 dated the 5th February, 1948, and the boundary between Muscat and Kalba is established at Khatam Malahah and is marked by a stone wall. I enclose copies of two original documents now in the possession of the present Shaikh of Sharjah, with translations. You will observe that in 1268 Hijri (99 years ago) Sai'd bin Sultan of Muscat renounced all intention to interfere with the tribes subject to Jawassim influence in the area from Khatam Malahah westwards and northwards to the Dhahirah. In 1288 Hijri Turki bin Sai’d reiterated his father’s undertakings to the Jawassim, but made an exception of Khassab. The Muscat claim to suzerainty over the Beni Ka’ab and the Nai'm of Buraimi (including the Al Bu Shamis) appears to be of more recent origin, because the present Shaikh of Sharjah claims that in 1268 Hijri the Jawassim were paramount over all the tribes of Buraimi. Had Muscat at that time any suzerainty over these tribes presumably it would have been mentioned in these documents^as Khassab was.2 A 0 In 1908 A.D. Lorimer (pages 963 &amp; 1302, Volume II) found the Beni Ka f ab distributed between the Oman Sultanate and Truclal Oman, and the Nal'm in both these areas as well as in Independant Oman; but he does not say under whose suzerainty they were at that time. If Muscat have since rejected the documents in the possession of the Shaikh of Sharjah and no longer recognize the boundary at Khatam Mahalah, now would appear to be the time to start settling the boundary again. I have _ ^ Jackson has already suggested that we should obtain statements of the boundaries claimed for Ras al Khaimah and Kalba from the prospective Shaikh and Regent, and I think we should recognize only those that are undisputed and leave the rest without prejudice for settle ment by negotiation with Muscat. would afr loaot limit-IIas ul Khaimah 1 o and-Ralba' 1 s el-gtms. The Shihuh recognize Muscat's suzerainty but the Shaikhs of Bakha and Fujairah do not. 6 * Our arbitration in the dispute between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and Sharjah's claim to Dhaid are not likely to stir up the question of frontiers between the Trucial Shaikhs and Saudi Arabia. 6 « There are no other active disputes over boundaries between the Trucial Shaikhs. On the subject of enforcement I would not go so far as to say that the establishment of a local force will never be necessary, for, if Petroleum Development ( Trucial Coast ) Limited's activities lead to our having to bake a more active interest in theeventually be necessary for use in Dhank, where at present there is no security and no single authority capable of establishing it. But I do not regard such a force as necessary for the enforcement of any settlement that we may reach in the Abu Dhabi and Dubai dispute, or in the dispute about sovereignty over Dhaid. The Shaikhs of the Trucial States are very susceptible to the sea power that we have had for years and, in addition, we now have the R.A.F. to call upon, although we have never had to do so in the past. I do not foresee our having to do so in the near future. The sanctions that we can use against the Trucial Shaikhs were mentioned in the enclosure to my demi-official letter No.C/7 dated the 3rd January, 1948. In boundary disputes that affect the development of oil resources, however, by far the most powerful Incentive to settlement is the desire of all the Trucial Shaikhs to have their oil resources developed^ and the knowledge that no company will develop oil In a disputed area should, I think, eventually lead them to agree to our arbitration and to their abiding by our awards. This will, perhaps, take time; but I believe that settlement by consent is feasible and Indeed the only satisfactory way of reaching IdMx&amp;WfiQAAfat a settlement.

According to Information obtained from Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi and certain bedouin of the Manaslr whom he consulted, the Mukhadhabah are an offshoot of the Khiyareen, a subsection of the Beni H&amp;jir. Of the Beni Hajir only the Khiyareen (including the Mukhadhabah) live in ^atar and they 1 ve there the whole year round. The KMyareen (Including the Mukhadr abah) number between 70 and £0 families.

Sir, I have the honour to report that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has complained that a Saudi Arabian party has recently penetrated Abu Dhabi territory as far east as Aqailah, which is situated a few miles from the coast about 130 miles west of Abu Dhabi (vide Hunter's map of Arabia and the Persian Gulf), in order to collect taxes from Murra and Manasir tribesmen, and has asked that a protest be lodged. The presence of this party is confirmed by one of the employees of Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, who met them in Abu Dhabi territory and was told by them that they had come to collect Ibn Baud's taxes from certain Murra tribesmen who had escaped to that territory. He reports that the party was well equipped with modern tents. 2. ^ The collection of taxes by Ibn Baud's men in Abu Dhabi territory is no new matter and I enclose an extract from a statement on this subject prepared in 1934. 3. There appears to be no doubt that Ibn Saud's party has penetrated a long way beyond the furthest boundary claimed by him and it is for consideration whether a protest should be lodged. I have no strong views on the subject myself and it may perhaps be advisable to refrain from making anything in the nature of a formal protest until the Saudi Arabian boundary in this area has been determined. I would suggest, however, that His Majesty's Ambassador Jedda might, if he sees no objection, enquire whether it is true that the Saudi Arabian party has penetrated Abu Dhabi territory in order to collect taxes with a view to showing that we are taking interest in the matter. 4.

That this party which was under the leadership of one Ibn Mansur, set up their camp at Arjan south-west of Abu Dhabi town near Umra Qatra. That they were short of food supplies and sent passengers to Dubai to fetch food for them, and that the Shaikh of Dubai sent them food supplies by a motor car. Shaikh Hazza* entertained suspicions for as to the incentive/this party to obtain food from Dubai rather than from Abu Dhabi which is nearer to their camp from Dubai.

No.C/S-123. /. /2 V7F'= °2-rJ~ /?/ ' Political Agency, Bahrain, October 8, 1949. Dear Sharjah, In connexion with the frontier negotiations we have practically no evidence to support our Abu Dhabi claim on the grounds of fairly recent use of the area from Sabkhat Matti to the boundary of the Qatar oil concession or to rebut any Saudi claim that their tribes frequent the area. P.C.L. landed vehicles between Khor el Odaid and Sabkhat Matti in 1937 and made a geological survey of which we have secured a copy. What we should like now is informa tion as specific as possible regarding the use made by people of the Trucial Coast (particularly Abu Dhabi), Qatar and Oman of the Abu Dhabi - Qatar caravan route nearest the coast. 2. The report from Qatar of which a copy was sent to you under our printed letter No.C/S-122 of today's date has some bearing on this matter. 3. Will you please have searching enquiries made and report as soon as possible? Yours ever,Secret* D.O. Ho. 9*7 -0255 British Agency, Sharjah, I'he 16th October, 1949. i)9 Dear Jakins, ¥111 you please refer to Bahrain Agency letter Ho. C/S-123 of 8 th October, 1949, regarding the Abu Dhabi-Qatar camel route. 2. I have made enquiries in Abu Dhabi and find that the most common route to Cat- -r lies inland and not along the coast as does the motor track. 3 . This route, which I have described in the enclosed note and map, is in frequent use by Shaikh Sbakhbut * s Manasir and Beni Yas trib snen vho take their camels to Qatar for grassing, particularly if the spring rains in that region have been heavy. The same route is used along part of its length by Abu Dhabi and also by Saudi tribes travelling from Qatar or Salwa to the Burairai area, but Shaikh Shakhbut and his bedouin with Whom I also spoke, considered that the Saudi tribes using it were in the minority. 4 . As I suggested in a minute of 11th October on the relevant Bahrain Agency file, it is possible to travel from Abu Dhabi to Qatar along the sea-coast in dry seasons, but such journeys are difficult owing to soft sabkhas and lack of wells and must be regarded as exceptional.

Reference to previous correspondence: Sharjah telegram No.903 of 16th October, 1949. Description of enclosure. Sir Rupert’s S.O. letter No.167/261/490 of 29th October, 1949, to Mr. Gethin. Subj ect. Trucial Coast Rulers collect ing ’Zakat’. mWg/gggm A, 157/261/49G The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, 29th October, 1949. Dear Gethin, In your Agency letter No.C/R-482 of the 19th October you informed us that Stobart had reported that no Trucial Coast Ruler claims or collects zakat from nomadic tribes. On the other hand, Jackson of Petroleum Concessions Limited some time ago said that he had frequently heard the word 'zakat” applied as a payment by tribesmen to local rulers. I should be grateful if Stobart could be asked to look into the matter further. In Muscat the term ’'zakat 1 ' is applied to the taxes recovered by the Sultan on dates and fish and it is possible that the taxes on dates collected by Ras al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi are also called zakat. I should also like it confirmed that no tax, widther called zakat or not, is collected by any of the rulers from any of the nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes, eg. by Abu Dhabi from the Manasir'or by Sharjah from the Beni Qitab. Yours sincerely, Sgd. W.R.Hay. J.A.F. Gethin, Esq., The Political Agent, Bahrain. .British Agency f Sharjahf The 20th November 1949, Confidential: B.O.No.1051-0255 Dear pelly, Will yon please refer to His Excellency the Political Resident’s S.O. to Gethin No.157/261/49G of 29th October 1949 forwarded to me under c/s-149 about Zakat. 2. Zakat is the only term employed in Truci 1 Oman to denote taxation of any kind. 5* The tax of dates from settled tribes in Liva and Has al Khaimah referred to in my telegram No. 903 of 16th October is therefore called Zakat. 4. The Shaikhs of Trucial Oman do not collect Zakat from nomadic tribes. Indeed, the payment of money is rather in the reverse direction. 5. I regret an error in my telegram No. 903 in thatlappear to have stated that Ras al Khaimah collects from Beni Yas. This is of course not the case. Ras al Khaimah collects from the Bidah (offshoot of Shihuh) and Abu Dhabi from settled Beni - Yas and Manasir living in Liva and Bnraimi. u Yours sincerely, •f X*., J.
