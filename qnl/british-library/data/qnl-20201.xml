His Excellency Sir Maurice Peterson, K.C.M.G., British Embassy, BAGDAD.TO:- The President, Court of First Inatence, Basra. llo:373 - 1932. Plaintiff: Abdalla A1 Zoheir in connexion with the estate of his testator Awasha A1 Zoheir Defendants: Hamad and Abdalla, sons of Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah and others Reply to the Plaintiff's Counsels Hote . In writing this Hote, we hope that it will be the final one in the case. It is regretted that we are at a loss whether the contents of our two legal Motes have not been properly understood by^/opponents or whether we failed to produce documents in their support or mention the sources of law from which they were taken, the opinions of the legal authorities, and the decrees issued by the Courts in similar cases, so that as a result our Kotes were so weak as to induce our opponents to P&amp;y no attention to them, or alternatively that the legal contents of those Notes were so strong as to bewilder our opponents, and leave them in a state of dizziness. As a matter of fact when pleading in that case we did not cite any article, quote any opinion, or mention any similar decree without indicating their original sources, and referring to the pages of the works relating thereto. Kow our opponents have reverted to their allegation generally and not in detail to the effect that our pleading in that case was without any support. They have, however, failed to discuss our arguments in this connexion and to mention whether our statement was correct or otherwise. As regards the question of Otiw repellence arising from the alleged incompetency of the Court, we have already^i^ased our case on two points:- (a) The capacity of the defendant Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber A1 Sabah as T&amp;iir of Koweit, and (b) Great Britain standing as guarantor for the property of Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah. /T e have-2- have already mentioned that for these tv/o reasons the hearing of the case is outside the jurisdiction of that Court, seeing that the subject matter of the case falls within the •jurisdiction of International Treaties. ' liereas the subject matter of this case v /ithin the conpetency of treaties, the Courts have no right to issue a decree thereon, seeing that everything that falls within the competency of the Treaties falls within the jurisdiction of the TCxecutive and not the judicial authori ties, and that these authorities should not transgress on the rights of each other, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. r e have, however, gained a great benefit in that our opponents have, after great trouble, waived their litigation against Sheikh Qaber Ahmed A1 Sabah, Sheikh of Koweit, as laid down on page 1 of their third Kote which is the subject of reply, the following: - Whatever the case may be and in order to refute the allegation of the defendants, I am prepared to turn out Sheildi Ahmed A1 Oaber from the case and direct it at present against the others mentioned by him in the bill of indictment.' In waiving his litigation against Sheikh Ahmed Al Gaber, the plaintiff admits of the first reason of the repellence that the case does not fall within the competency of the Court. This reason which we have already mentioned is that the Courts h^ve no competency to consider that case, especially as Sheikh Ahmed Al Oaber Al Sabah is the Chief of an independent State and enjoys the privileges of other ^ings and Heads of owcrs as provided for in General International Law. Though the plaintiff has in his Note expressed a readiness to turn out ^heikh Ahmed Al Gaber from that case, he, however, did so after alleging that the case was a personal one Ktoich deals with a dispute of property and therefore falls under general laws which are applied by the Courts. He gave as an evidence of his allegation in this connexion that the /Court has- 3 - Court has already Issued e decree in a case of Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber and others, overlooking the fact that Kings and Heads of Powers if they themselves do not accept to enjoy these privileges, no one can compel them to do so; and that it was the duty of the Court itself to announce its incompetency to hear that case, especially that such privileges are the legitimate right agreed upon for the head of that Power. The judgment previously issued in a case does not neceasarily drop the right of the Kail* in insisting upon the privileges enjoyed in his capacity as the Head of an independent State# 1'oreover the defendant has expressed a readiness to turn out Sheikh A1 Gaber A1 Sabah, Kmir of Koweit, from the case* In turning out Sheikh A1 Sabah from that case, this means that we have gained a great benefit in that the plaintiff admits of the first reason regarding the incorapetency of the Court to hear that case which also involves another admission i.e. that ordinary Courts have no right to issue a decree against certain persons whose relations with others fall within the competency of Interna tional Treaties. Since we have mentioned International Treaties and thair authority v /ith regard to disputes, and their confliction with that of the Courts, it may be worthy to mention the opinion of certain legal authorities in that connexion at the head of whom is Hamed Bey Fahmy, Counsellor in the Egyptian Court of Casration. Hamed Bey Fahmy referred to that question in a recent book of which he is the author and entitled 'Cassation in Civil and Commercial Tatters' and stated in paragraph 23 page 106 the following!~ 'It is agreed upon that whenever a treaty provides for a certain rule as laid down in Private International Law, it is the duty of the judge to ascertain - of his own accord - of its existence and whether It is advisable or otherwise to be applied taking into consideration the circumstances of the case brought before him in so far as the litigants are concerned. He has the right to interpret it whenever it is necessary to /settle/ (r - 4 - settle the legal question under dispute. His opinion in that case is subjected to the control of the Court of Cassation. It is also agreed upon that whenever a treaty concerns a question of Private International Law and sets forth rules which contravene the National Law, such a treaty mast indicate the action which should be taken in case of conflict arising or otherwise. If the treaty provides for the action to be taken in the event of conflict taking place, the judge should act accordingly, failing this the judge should follow the provisions of the treaty. Such action should be taken if the treaty was issued after the law. If the treaty was issued before the law, the judge should apply the provisions of the treaty, because the Power which issued a law cannot alone infringe the treaty without the previous consent of all Powers concerned, except through the legal process stipula ted in General International Lav/. The judgment issued by the judge in this connexion is subject to the control of the Court of Cassation.' llaned Bey Fahmy is not the only person Y/ho formed that opinion, but there are other legal authorities who share his views in this connexion, the first of them is D'espagnet as laid down in his book on Private International Law page 62 of the third edition, and Oppert in his article entitled Interpretation of Political Treaties on the hearing of Cases' 1 published in the Review of the Special International Law of 1899, page 433.' Turning to the case under reference after explaining these rules, we notice that there is an agreement between Great Britain and Koweit to the effect that the former guarantees to the latter its independence and protection. &gt;he also guarantees to the Kmlr of Koweit and his descendants, his property in Iraq. v e also noticed that there is another treaty between Irak and Great Britain organizing the relations between the two Powers and containing a special provision making it inoumbent /upon% 1 - 5 - upon each of the two Powers to respect the undertakings of the other, so long as they do not conflict with the Covenat of the League of Kations or the Pact for the Prevention of Var. It was agreed upon in that Treaty that in the ewent of any difference arising with regard to the interpretation or the spolication, the matter be referred for arbitration to the League of Kationa, if not settled in accordance with diplomatic methods. The agreement reached between Great Britain and Irak, therefore, excludes the Courts from the interpretation and the application of the Treaties and leaving it to diplomatic methods# If such methods proved a failure, the League of Nations has the right to decide the matter. all 1 e have explained/this in our first liote and it was accepted by the opponents in his last Kote and by his agreeing to exclude Sheikh Ahmed A1 Oaber A1 Sabah from the case. The plaintiff wishes that the case should continue against the other defendants, overlooking the fact that the agreement reached between Great Britain and Koweit in which Great Britain undertook to guarantee to the Sheikh of Koweit and his sons their property in Basra, does not mean that such guarantee concerned Sheikh laxbarak A1 Sabah only, as plaintiff attempted to establish, but that it involves also the Sheikas sons i.e. the remainder of the defendants, 'hereas the plaintiff has admitted of the correctness of that rule with regard to Sheikh Ahmed Al Sabah, he has tacitly admitted of the application of the rules of International Law. These rules involve the remainder of the defendants seeing that they have connexion with the agreement reached between Great Britain and Sheikh Ahmed Al Sabah# Under these circumstances the repellence with regard to the incompetency of the Court to consider the present c case co rrect and based on sound grounds, from the point of view of law, the legal authorities and the Courts rulings. v e put forward other grounds of repellence in the case viz: /the lapsem Q m th© lupise ot tim* ond ocketf for the n&lt;»i-herring of the case and sumtlonad in the oemrM of •rgmwit that mt o*n«r«hip of the property was lawfal# since it nam purchased from tho testator of tho plaintiff# In his last Koto tho plaintiff interpreted that st^tonont as a recognition of hie omorshipt dospito the lap so of tixoo and gave as ©vidonco of his allogatlon in this connexion article 1674 of the 'Liasallsh% W# should therefore go back to tho text of Article 1674 of tho f agallsh' in orCap to sBcerfcaln tho intention of the author of that tost* Article 1674 of tho 'Mogollah' nans a« follotrai- ' Q jo forfeiture of ri^ht cannot be effected by lapre of tiiae# there fore if the defendant clearly admits in tho presence of the Courts that the plaintiff has an existing right in a case of looted by prescription in the nanner clained by the plaintiff# no consideration should bo given to the prescription end a decree should be iessued in accordsnoe with the confession of the dofondant** Thie is tho text of ttie Artiole of '41 -asallah' irhlch does not mquire any explanation. It alee provides that the eonfeesion of the rlrfht olaimed should take plaeo during - - — •' - • referred to that natter and gave exaaploe in which he sayss- The word existing is a precautionary restriction 'hioh means that the confession of the defendant does not repel prescription exeept vhen he adrsits of that ri jht being under his security. It therefore follows that if a person clains a property alleged to he in his ownerrihip and inherited from hie father and the defendant replio*. that he puyoh^sed it from the father or uncle# far a certain mm, and has possessed it for 40 years* no ovidsnee is rsquirod here in support of the purchase, hut the only thine required from hin is to prove his disposal of that property during that lapse of time, because in claiiaing the purchase from I the father&gt;Cj • 7 • th« and mother of plain tiff t he did not adiait of their o ^norship at present, and therefore his confeasion esnnet bo repelled by the pro bc riptIon. If m revert after this to tlM definition of the Js confeeaion, a reference to thicjud* in Article 1698 of Ow egellafc' vliioh runs as follow, 'Confenolon it en aok-nowledgraent by a person of a right bolonging to another, therefore be la called the oonfessor, ^hlle tho other la called the poreon confesr od to# and the ri^ht# tlie aeimoT'lod^ed rlgjit# After explaining these rales, vie have to return to «lif?t the plaintiff called the aekno^lodgod rlgfrt* Xt appears that the plaintiff has not understood the real fact or attested to eetahllah the contrary. All that we aald la that we purchased that property and produced doounents in support thereof# IMs rebuts the alalia put forward by the plaintiff for the ownership of that property. therefore the prescription nwither repels nor forfeits the stateaont u tde by us in this connexion* here now renains the question of the legal excuse* The plaintiff appears to have difierofi froc: us in the interpretation of the Intermittent absence and gave as evidence of his allege- tlon the text of A .rtleles 1463 and 1464* He eormitted a nistake in this and perhnps he wished to refer to Articles 1665 and 1664* Before discussing the provisions of those fe*o rtielea, we consider it advisable to speak briefly on the question of the c-xoases that repel the lap bo of time* '• o have now an epistle by lialtre akl Kheir M Abu T oog I Boy, President of the 1 ar«juet in the Civil Circle of the Court of Cassation, called uspension of prescription for oocxpulsory reasons and incapacitated circu»staneee« On perusal of that epistle we found that It contained the opinions of the author as *?ell as those ether legal authorities vfctlch are the sw'imary of a lenghty study in connexion with the prescription and its suspension* B Ah® epistle— m Q m The epistle Is vorthy of oonslderstlon and appreciation. r he author mentions on page 11 of that epistle the following^ Baudret (?) and Teesle (t) are of the opinion that the prescription was enacted for social Interest ritl the stability of the fait accoapll and paying no hood to past events* overlooking the wlsdoa In enacting the law of prescription the prescription is based on the presuoptlon that tho omer of the right has neglected his right and left it* and did not pay any attention for Its malntenmce and therefor© the Incapable person Is to be executed fron the application of the prescription on account of his lack of discrirdnation* -he sane should bo loslcally applied to wlioover cannot maintain his right oidng to forced clrcunstances, because in that case he absolutely cannot claim his right# It is Inposslble to aacrlbe to negligence or Inability a case where action was Isipossible* A person cannot be asked to do the linposaible« In reply to Uaudret and Bessieallegation ^ihat the interest of the IndlvidUi^l should be forfeited for public interest, the author points out that law® were intended for the coriplote sacrifice of the interest of the Individual to the public benefit* but that the Interest of the Individual should also be taken into consideration^ r llie author of the epistle them loft to reasons for the prescription for discussion of legal excuses, and dealt with the question of absence* pointing out on page 15 the following J- 'itie question of absence has remained the source of dlfieremce of opinion in the Egyptian Courts* owing to the text of Article 152 of a book called urahed al llayraan : ( k guide for the perplexed) rhich places absence with minority and lunacy, and. considers it apong legal excuses rhich prevents the progress3^ - 9 - The author then expressed his personal opinion with regard to the question of absence and stated on page 14 the following:- 'Distinction should be made in the case of absence between two things. If the absence is a corunon one, (i.e# if a person leaves for a certain known orZunknown place and then returns) his absence in this case cannot prevent the progress of prescription, because it was possible for him to take the necessary measures before his departure for the protection of his rights from forfeiture* Even if he lives far away from his country, it is possible for him - in the existence of the present facilities agreed upon among the various Governments - to send a power of attorney to whoever represents him in claim ing his rights, failing this he will be considered negligent. Prescription cannot be suspended in the presumption of negligence as already mentioned. An exceptional case should be allowed if the absentee suffered from a forced incident during his absence, such as captivity, the cutting of communications, or the quarantine restrictions on account of pest, etc. In these cases the prescription cannot be operative for reasons of absence but for the forced incident which was not the result of any negligence• But if a person was caused to be absent by force, for example being deported from his own country, such person shall not be excused if it was in his ability before his departure to appoint an Agent or was, during his deportation, able to appoint an representative to file a suit claiming his rigjit. The contrary is applied, if it has been proved that he was deported to a place where he could not appoint an Agent, or was in a state of absolute inability to do anything to maintain his right. Such a case is considered to be of a forced nature which warrants the suspension of prescription. According to Sharia (i.e. Islamic Religious Law -trans lator) Authorities, where a person is held to be absent, his case, under Sharia Law comes under one of two heads, either /where-10- where he appoints an Agent before his aosence to maintain his property and administer his affairs, or where he has no Agent. In the latter case the Sharia judge appoints an Agent for him* See Articles 572 and 573 in the book on 'Sharia Rules regarding Personal Status' by Kadri Pasha. In both cases the prescription should be applied against him, because the Agent represents him in the maintenaice of his rights against forfeit. In tue case of negligence on the part of the Agent, he himself or nis neirs have grounds of action against the Agent. It may be pointed out in objection to this that the prescription is not applied to the incapacitated for whom a guardian or attendant is appointed to administer his affairs and maintain his rights. In reply to this I have to say that the incapacitated lacks discrimination and cannot administer his own affairs, if he finds his guardian or attendant negligent in maintaining his rights. Therefore the legislator has provided a special procedure for this. The absentee of complete apacity and discrimination can administer his own affairs and maintain his own rights. If he appoints an Agent, or such an Agent is appointed by the judge on his behalf, he has to under go the consequences of his bad selection in the first place, and the non -administration of his own affairs which is a kind of n©?;lir;ence and does warrant the suspsnsion oi th# prescription. Also if the judge appoints an Agent to an absentee whose absence is intermittent, and that if his absence was of his own accord leaving his affairs without being administered and his rights maintained, this is also considered a negligence which does not warrant the suspension of the prescription. In this case the forced events are excluded.' To summarize these opinions the suspension of the prescription goes back to 3 things vizi incapacity, lore©/ majeur and absence. The author considers force majeur is that in which a person is in a state of absolute impossijilty /to claim- u - to claim hla plghtt # iia also oonsldora trmt th® preBcrlptlon should lae applied to the Agentir suoh%gent is appointed by the absentee himself or by the Judge on his behalf* lie also to coneidors that the prescription cannot fca applied the incapacitated whether or not he has a guardian. He also explains the difference tetween the ino^paoitated and the absentee. The opinion expressed by the author is the exact text o# article I66fc of the Ujagallah vhieh runs as Ibllovss:- Lapse of tints as a bar to the hearing of a case must ha where the actual period has parsed without legal excuse. is regards a period which has passed with a legal excuse as where the plaintiff was a minor, or inaant, whether haring guardian or not, or was in a far country, or whose legal opponent is one who conquered the country by force, such cannot be taken as an example t seeinp that the period can only be counted from the date on which he reached his majority. Also if a person who has a case against a conqaeror and cannot put up a claim during the period of the conquest end it is found that lapse of time does bar the hearing of the case t such prescription shal i date fit)® the termination of that conquest. ^ It appears from that text that when referring to the Ineapaeitated, it was decided not to apply the prescription whether sueh person was legally represented or not. The autfior li»tor referred to the absentee and did not mention anything regarding his legal represent at lye. This distinction on his ' t o l ns that the case with regt rd to absence differs from that oi incapacity. That is to say he raaices no difference in the case of incapacity itself, whether there is representative or otheiwiae. In the case of absence, the presence of an ^gent prevents the suspension of prescription whether such /.gent was appoirted ly the absentee or the judge. This is exactly the Islaaie ^har'ie Rules, as considered by Maltre iSaki xheir jl- ibu Te gl iey. Tui-ning..- Xii - Turning to the subject matter of the present o^ae after referring to the atoYem ntloned rules, ne notice that Madane iwwasha ill- Jo heir has appointed her hueland - iihraed Pasha ^1-iohelr- as igent and the latter In turn appointed itdel fcahato Pafifoa tortus and that the •xl ate nee of that po«er of attorney preTents the suspension of the prescription. The absence of that lady so long as ^e has an igent representIpg her cannot fce pleaded In testator favour of I'aduroe j^wwaaha, the plalntl rf 's %xxX9i\ o the defendant hl:aaelf« In the text referring to tkm absence as described ia article I663 t the absence might be considered as arising from fbroe majeur, seeing that trfevelilng at that time was difficult. I.e. when this rule was inacted. But now that the me&amp;ns of traTelling have beoooa easy, the reason for the enactment of that legislation has now disappeared, effect that is to say both cause and XJPDWBt hare totally disappeared* inyhow whether the absence is as stipulated in article 1663 or not. It has become no longer a reason which warrants the suspension of prescription in so far as the case under reference Is concerned* Under the circumstances, we Insist on our demands stipulated in our first Hote, and charge the plaintiff.

Z # 4715/38 of 12tli July enclosing copies of correspondence with &amp;owle and de G-aury about the date gardens. Gaury is arranging for a copy of the judgment in the Paddaghiyah case to be sent to Rushdi Bey at Cairo. We feel here that we should certainly provide the Sheikh with some legal assistance during the appeal, if it comes off, i.e. if proceedings are not stayed by the application oi Land Settlement Procedure, and it would no doubt be unfair to hold it against Rushdi Bey that he lost the first round. Though some of the arguments on international law advanced in his various memoranda to the Court have indeed seemed to us rather doubtful, we have no reason to suppose that his pleading is not generally an able document and he must know the case well by now- and in view of the obvious disadvantages in changing horses in mid-stream, we are inclined to feel that he should be kept on. Will you let us know what you think, if necessary after consultation with Fowle? Treasury sanction for further expenditure will of course be necessary. I am sending a copy of this letter to Inch at the Treasury. We note from this correspondence that de Yours sincerely. (Sd. ) C.W. BAXTER.u P.Z.4 672/S8. / / / INDIA omcs, mirmnLL, s.w.i. 6th July, 1938. Dear Crosthwaite, •e hare sent the Foreign Office a succession of telegrams, resting with our telegram to trie Political Resident of the 5th July, No. 1216 (India Office printed letter of the 5th July, P.Z.4524/38) about the threat to take possession of Rafiah , s share of the Bashiyah estate of the Shaikh of Koweit's date gardens in Iraq. I now enclose a copy of correspondence on the subject received from the Political Resident. In pursuing our request for information in our telegrwn of the 5th July we were relying on the opinion of the Legal Secretary of the Bagdad iShibassy in 1933 (enclosure to Bagdad despatch to the Political Resident, Wo.29, dated 22nd July 1933, Foreign Office reference 15 .4474/308/93) that it was almost impossible for the Sheikh to lose possession until all the claimants had obtained jud^nents in their favour. It seems doubtful, however, whether in fact the Sheikh can rely on this as regards Rafiah's share, and it may be, in view of the correspondence referred to in the Resident's tel^ -ranf of the 9th June, No.239, (enclosure to India Office printed letter of the 10th June, P.Z.4025/38) that there is no ground for seeking a stay of execution and that the Sheikh can only be advised to put in his counter-claim for the sum paid by his predecessor in respect of Rafia's share. As regards the share of Behiyah and the other heirs, the Sheikh's lawyer is apparently confident that His Highness could not establish his title if he tried to resist an attachment. It might, however, be worth his while to delay matters by opposing the attachment, even though the court/ .Crosthwaite, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.I.court should find agninst him as in the c^se of Rafiah's share ? Belay rai^ht afford an opportunity to forestall a decision of the Court by the application of the Land Settlement procedure to the property ? We should be grateful for the Tiews of the Foreign Office on the advice to be given to the Sheikh. It may be that you will wish to consult the ifimbassy in the first case before sending us a reply. k copy of this letter and enclosure is being sent to the Treasury. Yours sincerely, (3d.) J.

I see that Fowle's telegrams K08.259 and 240— of the 9th June were repeated to you at the time, but 1 enclose herein copies of certain further telegrams between the India Office and the Gulf which you do not seefn to have had yet. The India Office have asked for our riews as to the advice to be given the Sheikh, but we are up against an initial difficulty because we ^re not even clenr what the 'If t»,l3 If facts really nre. In de Gsury 1 ^ telegrams hf the 27tH June, it is stated that a lady by name Bahija, one of the heirs to the orieinsl vendors of the property, has had 'her share** attached for a debt by her to another member of the family, although she has not w filed a awit', presumably against the 3 ■ ? -•3£ P- f by Sheika. In his telegram of the 12th vuly, however, ^owle states thrt three more heirs have obtained attachments against the Sheikh 1 s property, like Rafiya and Bahijp. Clenrly if Bahija has not filed a suit against the Sheikh, whe cannot have got an attachment order against him. If, as we suppose, r-' fe. t ie information in the enclosure in oagdad despatch No.70 (230/2/36) of the 8th February, 1936, is correct, shija has in fact filed a suit against the Sheikh, but in any case it would appear from the letter from the Sheikh's lawyer at Basra to the Sheikh's son (fourth enclosure in '^ushire despatch under reference) that whst Bahije has done is not * to/ BI,Houstoun*Boswall, S st . , M.C., Bagdad.U* j 2. to secure en attachment order against the Sheikh, but something quite different. The facts as far an we can make out are as follows: (1) One heir, Rafiya, established her right in 1933 to a twelfth p-rt of the property, but has apparently not yet taken any steps to get possession. (2) The majority of the other heirs have filed suits against the Sheikh, but (although this is a doubtful point) hsve still not been able to make any progress. (3) If they could effect the service of the necessary documents on the Sheikh, they could without difficulty, like Rafiya, establish their claims to their shares of the property, and (4) Bahija has now thought of an ingenious way round the service difficulty; another menber of the fa ily, to whom she is 'indebted', applies to the courts for an attachnent on her share of the property. As she hss a valid title deed to the property and does not defend the case, the court takes action as requested, unless the Sheikh intervenes. The Sheikh cannot, however, intervene with any prospect of success, ps the transfer of property to him in the first place was invalid, i .e. in manoeuvring the Sheikh out of the position of defendant, she has managed to get the issue before the courts. However, as I have said above, a good deal of this is only guess-work, and we should be grateful if you could make enquiries and let us know as soon as possible what the facts really are. Incidentally, it occurs to me that it might be most useful if the Consulate at Basra were brought into the matter to a greater extent than has, I think, been the case in the past. There seems to be something of a drive against the Sheikh just now, and reports from the Consulate on all developnents might be a valuable supplement to the information that we get via the Sheikh. ,r e/— *mmmmm ^ m P.^.5296/1958.

To;- The President, Court of First Instance, Basra. No:373 - 1932. Plaintiff: Abdalla A1 Zoheir in connexion with the estate of his testator Awwasha A1 Zoheir. Defendants: Hamad and Abdalla, sons of Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah and others. R eply to the Plaintiff's Counsels Note . In writing this Note, we hope that it will be the final one in the case. It is regretted that we are at a las s whether the contents of our two legal Notes have not been properly understood by our opponents or whether we failed to produce documents in their support or mention the sources of law from which they wtre taken, the opinions of the legal authorities, and the decrees issued by the Courts in similar cases, so that as a result our Notes were so weak as to induce our opponents to pay no attention to them, or alternatively that the legal contents of those Notes were so strong as to bewilder our opponents, and leave them in a state of dizziness. As a matter of fact when pleading in that case we did not cite any article, quote any opinion, or mention any similar decree without indicating their original sources, and referring to the pages of the works relating thereto. Now our opponents have reverted to their allegation generally and not in detail to the effect that our pleading in that case was without any support. They have, however, failed to discuss our arguments in this connexion and to mention whether our statement was correct or otherwise. As regards the question of repellence arising from the alleged incompetency of the Court, we have already based our case on two points:- (a) The capacity of the defendant Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber A1 Sabah as Lmir of Koweit, and (b) Great Britain standing as guarantor for the property of Sheikh Mubarak A1 Sabah. We/vVe have already mentioned that for these two reasons the hearing of the case is outside the jurisdiction of that Court, seeing that the subject matter of the case falls within the jurisdiction of International Treaties. Whereas the subject matter of this case falls within the competency of Treaties, the Oourts have no right to issue a decree thereon, seeing that everything that falls within the competency of the Treaties falls within the jurisdiction of the Executive and not the judicial authorities, and that these authorities should not transgress on the rights of each other, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. We have, however, gained a great benefit in that our opponents have, after great trouble, waived their litigation against Sheikh Gaber Ahmed A1 Sabah, Sheikh of Koweit, as laid down on page 1 of their third Note which is the subject of reply, the following:- ''Whatever the case may be and in order to refute the allegation of the defendants, I am prepared to turn out Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber from the case and direct it at present against the others mentioned by him in the bill of indictment,' , In waiving his litigation against Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber, the plaintiff admits of the first reason of the repellence that the case does not fall within the competency of the Court. This reason which we have already mentioned is that the Courts have no competency to consider that case, especially as Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber A1 Sabah is the Chief of an independent State and enjoys the privileges 01 other Kings and Heads of Powers as provided for in General International Law. Though the plaintiff has in his Note expressed a readiness to turn out Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber from that case, he, however, did so after alleging that the case was a personal one wiich deals with a dispute of property and therefore falls under general laws which are apnlled by the Courts. He gave as an evidence of his allegation in this connexion that the Court/Uo 3 • Court has dready issiaed a decree in a case of Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber and others, overlooking the fact that Kings and Heads of Powers if they themselves do not accept to enjoy these privileges, no one can compel them to do so; and that it was the duty o the Court itself to announce its incompetency to hear that case, especially that such privileges are the legiti mate right agreed upon for the head of that Power. The judgment previously issued in a case does not necessarily drop the right of the Emir in insisting upon the privileges enjoyed in his capacity as the Head of an independent State. Moreover the defendant hss expressed a readiness to turn out Sheikh A1 Gaher Al Sabah, Emir of Koweit, from the case. In turning out Sheikh Al Sabah from that case, this means that we have gained a great benefit in that the plaintiff admits of the lirst reason regarding the incompetency of the Court to hear that case which also Involves another admission, i.e. that ordinal Courts have no right to issue a decree against certain persons whose relations with others fall within the competency of Interna tional Treaties. Since we have mentioned International Treaties and their authority with regard to disputes, and their confliction with that of the Courts, it may be worthy to mention the opinion of certain legal authorities in that connexion at the head of whom is Hamed Bey Fahrny, Counsellor in the j gyptian Court of Cassation. Hamed Bey Pahmy referred to that question in a recent book of which he is the author and entitled ^Cassation in Civil and Commercial Matters' and stated in paragraph 23 page 106 the following:- 'It is agreed upon that whenever a treaty provides for a certain rule as laid down in Private International Law, iz is the duty of the judge to ascertain - of his own accord - of its existence and whether it is advisable or otherwise to be applied taking into consideration the circumstances of the case brought before him in so far as the litigants are concerned. He has the right to interpret it whenever it is necessary to settle/settle the legal question under dispute. His opinion in that case is subjected to the control of the Court of Cassation. It it) also agreed upon that whenever a treaty concerns a question of Private International Law and sets forth rules which contravene the National Law, such a treaty must indicate the action which should be taken in case of conflict arising or otherwise. If the treaty provides for the action to he taken in the event of conflict taking place, the judge should act accordingly, failing tais the judge should follow the provisions of the treaty. Such action should be taken if the treaty was issued after the law. If the treaty was issued before the law, the judge should ap ly the previsions or the treaty, because the Power which issued a law cannot alone infringe the treaty without the previous consent of all Powers concerned, except through the legal process stipula- in vjeneral International Law. The judgment issued by the judge in this connexion is subject to the control of the Court of Cassation.' Hamed Bey -Pahmy is not the only person who formed that opinion, but there ere other legal authorities who share his views in tills connexion, the first of them is D'espagnet as laid down ia his book on Private International Law page 62 of the third edition, and Qppert in his article entitled 'Interpretation of Political Treaties on the hearing of Gases' published in the Review of the Special International Law of 1899, page 433.' iurnin^ -o the case under reference after explaining these rules, we notice that there is an agreement between Great Britain and Koweit to the effect that the former guarantees to the latter its independence and protection. She also guarantees to the mir of Koweit and his descendants, his property in Iraq. /e also noticed that there is another treaty between Irak and Great Britain organizing the relations between the two Powe ■ s and containing a special provision making it incumbent upon/it - 5 - upon each of the two Powers to respect the undertakings of the other, so long as they do not conflict with the Corenant of the League of Kationa or the Pact for the Prevention of Var. It was agreed upon in chat Treaty that in the event of any difference arising with regard to the interpretation or the application, the matter be referred for aroitration to the ■uoague ui -Nations, ii not settled in accordance with diploiiiatic aietnods, i'he agreement reached between Orreat .Britain and I^axt, therefore, excludes the Courts fro^i the interpretation and the application of the 'i?rea.ties and leavin ^ it to diplomatic .iiethods. If such uiethods proved a failure, the League of Nations has the right to decide the matter, e have explained all this in our first Note and it was accepted by the opponent in his last Kote and by his agreeing to exclude Sheikh Ahmed A1 Gaber A1 Sabah from the case. The plaintiit wishes that the case should continue against the other u.efendantp, overlooking the fact that the agreement reached jecween Great Britain and Koweit in which Great -Britain undertook guarantee to the Sheixh of Koweit and his sons their property iii Jiaera, does not mean that such guarantee coacerned Sheikh Mubarak Ai Sabah only, as plaintiff attempted to establish, but that it involves also the Sheikh's sons i.e. the remainder of the defendants. Ir.hereas the plaintiff has admitted of the correctness of that rule with regard to Sheikh Ahmed Al Sabah, he has tacitly admitted of the application of the rules of International Law. These rules involve the remainder of the defendants seeing that they have connexion with the agreement reached between Great Britain and Sheikh Ahmed Al Sabah. Under these circumstances the repellence with regard to the incompetency of the Court to consider the present case is correct and based on sound grounds, from the point of view of law, the le.jal authorities and the Court's rulings, We put forward other grounds of repellence in the case viz; /the lapseyj 6, the lapse of time and asked for the non-hearing of the case and mentioned in the course of argument that our ownership of the property was lawful, since it was purchased from the testator of the plaintiff. In his last Note the plaintiff interpreted that statement as a recognition of his ownership, despite the lapse of time and gave as evidence of his allegation in this connexion Article 1674 of the w Magallah M # We should therefore go 'back to the text of Article 1674 of the n Magallah H in order to ascertain the intention of the author of that text# Article 1674 of the H Magallah w runs as follows:- 'The forfeiture of right cannot he effected by lapse of time. There fore if the defendant clearly admits in the presence of the Courts that the plaintiff has an existing right in a case effected by prescription in the manner claimed by the plaintiff, no consideration should be given to the prescription and a decree should be issued in accordance with the confession of the defendant. w This is the text of the Article of 'Al-Magallah' which does not require any explanation. It also provides that the confession of the right claimed should take place during the progress of the case. The annotator of the M Magallah M referred to that matter and gave examples in which he says;- The word existing is a precautionary restriction which means that the confession of the defendant does not repel prescription except when he admits of that right being under his security. It therefore follows that if a person claims a property alleged to be in his ownership and inherited from his father and the defendant replies that he purchased it from the father or uncle, for a certain sum, and has possessed it for 40 years, no evidence is required here in support of the purchase, but the only thing required from him is to prove his disposal of that property during that lapse of time, because in claiming the purchase from the father and mother of plaintiff, he did not admit of their/1° 7. their ownership at present, and therefore his confession cannot 'be repelled by the prescription. If we revert after this to the definition of the confession, a reference to this is made in Article 1598 of the 'Magallah' which runs as follows M Confession is an acknowledgment by a person of a right 'belonging to another, therefore he is called the confessor, while the other is called the person confessed to, and the right, the acknowledged right. w After explaining these rules, we have to return to what the plaintiff called the acknowledged right. It appears that the plaintiff has not understood the real fact or attempted to establish the contrary. All that we said is that we i purchased that property and produced documents in support thereof. This rebuts the claim put forward by the plaintiff for the ownership of that property. Therefore the prescription neither repels nor forfeits the statement made by us in this connexion. There now remains the question of the legal excuse. The plaintiff appears to have differed from us in the interpretation of the intermittent absence and gave as evidence of his allegation the text of Articles 1463 and 1464. He coiwnitted a mistake in this and perhaps he wished to refer to Articles 1663 and 1664. Before discussing the provisions of those two Articles, we consider it advisable to speak briefly on the question of the excuses that repel the lapse of time. We have now an epistle by Waitre Zaki Kheir A1 Abu Teegi Bey, President of the Parquet in the Civil Circle of the Court of Cassation, called 'Suspension of prescription for compulsory reasons incapacitated circumstances. M On perusal of that epistle we found that it contained the opinions of the author as well as tuose other legal authorities which are the summary of a lengthy stiudy in connexion with the prescription and its suspension.The epistle/I 1 8» The eplatlo is worthy of ooncideration and eppreci&amp;tion. The author nientiono on poge 11 of that ©piatle the followin^:- Baudret (?) end 2?e0oiu (?) ere of tho opinion that the preocription v »f B enacted for aocial interest vie: the stability of the felt accompli end ptiyin,;. no heed to peot events, overlookin the wisdom in enactin ; the law of pr soription whioh is the most important element in their legislation vizj the prescription is besed on the presumption that the owner of the right has neglected his right and left it, and did not pay any attention for its maintenjjice onti therefore the inoapeble person is to be exempted from the application of the prescription on account of his lac of discri linatioiu The same should be locically applied to whoev r cannot meintain his right owizk to forced circumstances, because in Uiat case he absolutely cannot claim his right. It is impossible to ascribe to negligence or inability ? case where action was impossible* A person cannot be asksH to do the ii .possible• n In reply to Baidret and Teeele 1 9 alljgation that the interest ol the individual should be forfeited for public interest, the author points out that lews -fare intended for the complete sacrifice of the interest of the individual to the public benefit, but that the irt rest of the individual should elso be taifen into consideration. The author of the epistle then left to reasons for the prescription for discussion of legal excuaes, and dealt with the question of absence, pointing out on page 13 the followingJ- The question of absence has remained the source of difference of opinion in the Egyptian Courts, o^ing to the text of article 152 of a book called 1 Murshed al Heyraan (A guide for the perplexed) which places absence with minority and lunacy, end considers it among legel excuses which prevents the progress of lapse of time. TheThe author then expressed his personal opinion with regard to the question of absence and stated on page 14 the following:- ''Distinction should be made in the case of absence between two things. If the absence is a common one, (i.e. if a person leaves for a certain known or an unknown place and then returns) his absence in this case cannot prevent the progress of prescription, because it was possible for him to take the necessary measures before his departure for the protection of his rights from forfeiture. .ven if he lives far away from his country, it is possible for him - in the existence of the present facilities agreed upon among the various Governments - to send a power of attorney to whoever represents him in claiming his rights, foiling this he will be considered negligent. Prescription cannot be suspended in the presumption of negligence as already mentioned. An exceptional case should be allowed if the absentee suffered from a forced incident during his absence, such as captivity, the cutting of communications, or the quarantine restrictions on account of pest, etc. In these cases the prescription cannot be operative for reasons of absence but for the forced incident which was not the result of any negligence. But if a person was caused to be absent by force, for example being deported from his own country, such person shall not be excused if it was in his ability before his departure to appoint an Agent or was, during his deportation, able to appoint a representative to file a suit claiming his right. The contrary is applied, if it has been proved that he was deported to a place where he could not appoint an Agent, or was in a state of absolute inability to do anything to maintain his ri^ht. ^uch a case is considered to be of a forced nature which warrants the suspension of prescription. According to oharia (i.e. Islamic Religious Law - translator) Authorities, where a person is held to be absent, his case, under Sharia Law comes under one of two heads, either whereV 10. where he appoints an Agent before his absence to maintain his property and administer his affairs, ot where he has no Agent. In the latter case the Sharia judge appoints an Agent for him. See Articles 672 and 57^3 in the book on 'Sharia Rules regarding Personal Status 11 by Kadri Pasha. In both cases the prescription should be applied against him, because the Agent represents him in the maintenance of his rights against forfeit. In the case of negligence on the part of the Agent, he himself or his heirs haye grounds of action against the Agent. It may be pointed out in objection to this that the prescription is not applied to the incapacitated for 'whom a guardian or attendant is appointed to administer his affairs and maintain his rights. In reply to this I haTe to say that the incapacity ted lacks discrimination and cannot administer his own affairs, if he finds his guardian or attendant negligent in maintaining his rights. Therefore the legislator has provided a special procedure for this. The absentee of complete capacity and discrimination can administer his own affairs and maintain his own rights. If he appoints an Agent, or such an Agent is appointed hy the judge on his behalf, he has to undergo the consequences of his bad selection in the first place, and the non-administration of his own affairs which is a kind oi negligence and does warrant the suspension of the prescription. Also if the judge appoints an Agent to an absentee whose absence is intermittent, and tiiat ii his absence was of his own accord leaving his affairs without being administered and his rights maintained, this is also considered a negligence which does not warrant the suspension of the prescription. In this case the forced events are excluded.' To summarize these opinions the suspension of the prescription goes back to 3 things viz: incapacity, force majeur and absence. The author considers force majeur is that in which a person is in a state of absolute impossibility to11. to claim his right. He slso considers that the prescription should be applied to the Agent, if such Agent is appointed by the absentee himseliT or by the judge on his behalf. He also considers that the prescription cannot be applied to the incapacitated whether or not he has a guardian. He also explains the difference between the incapacitated and the absentee• The opinion eapresaed by the author Is the exact text 01 Article 1662 oiC the 'Megallah' which runs as follows:- .Liapse oi time as a bar to the hearing of a case must be where the aotuel period has passed without legal excuse. As regards a period which has passed with a legal excuse as where the pleintifi was a minor, or insane, whether having guardian or not, or was in a far country, or whose legal opponent is one who conquered the country by force, such cannot be taken as an example, seeing that the period can only be counted from the daue on which he reached his majority. Also if a person who has a case against a conqueror and cannot put up a claim during the period of the conquest and it is found that lapse of time does bar the hearing of the case, such prescription shall date from the termination of that conquest. 1 It appears from that text that when referring to the incapacitated, it was decided not to apply the prescription whether such person was legally represented or not. The author later referred to the absentee and did not mention anything regarding his legal representative. This distinction on his part means that the case with regard to absence differs from that of incapacity. That it la to say he makes no difference in the cese of incapacity itself, whether there is representative or otherwise. In the case of absence, the presence of an Agent prevents the suspension of prescription whether such Agent was appointed by the absentee or the Judge. This is exactly the Islaiaie 3haria Rules, as considered by Maitre Zaki Kheir Al- Abu Teegi Bey. Turning12. Turning to the subject matter of the present case after referring to the aoovtiiaentionecl rules, we notice that jiadaoie Awwasha Al-Zoheir has appointed her husbana • Ahuied Pasha Al-^oheir - as Agent and the latter in turn appointed Abdel V.ahhao Pasha Al-^ortas and that xhe existence of that power of attorney prevents the suspension of the prescription, i'he absence of that lady so lon^ as she has an Agent representing her can iot be pleaded in favour of Madam# Awwasha, the plaintiff's testator, or of the defendant himself. In the text referring to absence as described in Article 1663, the absence might be considered as arising from force najeur, seeing that travellin at that time was difficult, i,e. whe this rule was enacted. But now that the means of travelling have become easy, the reason for the enactmant of that legislation has now disappeared, that is to aay both cause and effect have totally disappeared. Anyhow whether the absence is as stipulated in Article 1663 or not, it has become no xonger a reason which warrants the suspension of prescription in so far as the case under reference is concerned, tfnde.; the cirouus &amp;auces, we insist on our demands stipulated in our xirst Note, and charge the plaintifi, in addition to the legal expenses of the case and the lawyer's fees, with the expanse incurroa on drafting this Note.-P.Z.5X48/38 4 BRITISH fflffiASSY, No. 8 ALSX'iiDRIA.

Yours sincerely, (Sd) C*W. BAXTER, -^J.P* Gibson, Esq*Z.5371/1938. COPY. Pi (3.4421/28/93) S E C R 3 T . Dear Mr. Ward In reply to your letter No .192/27/38, I have the honour to inform you that the case of the Sheikh of Koweit is correct in pursuance of the laws operative in Iraq and that the documents relative thereto are also correct from the point of view of those laws. I have explained these opinions in three notes -which I submitted to the Basra Court. I have also discussed in those notes the whole case from all points of view. It is noteworthy to invite your attention to the fact that these notes were not a mere defence in favour of the Sheikh of Koweit but that their contents were written from deep belief and true faith. I have not contented myself with my opinion on this case, but I have also sought the opinion of many legal authorities about the contents of my notes, and they have fully agreed with me. I take this opportunity - though this occurred to my mind before the arrival of your above-mentioned letter - to mention to you briefly my belief in the destiny of the case. Courts in Iraq are composed of Iraqi judges presided over by English magistrates. I have observed that Iraqis in general are affected by their feelings more than their minds. Perhaps in so far 'as this case is concerned they have not yet forgotten that the Sheikh of Koweit supported the English in 1914, and offered them facilities for the occupation of Basra. This he did by standing against the Turkish army until the arrival of British troops from India. An agreement in this sense was concluded between the Sheikh and the British Government. I think that in giving judgment in this case those2. those judges -were still affected by that past memory„ I consider, therefore, that the only solution for this case is that an. appeal should be raised new against the judgment given by the Basra Court, and before a judgment is given by the Court of Appeal in this respect, it is necessary that the British Government should meanwhile enter into political conversations with the Iraqi Government about this matter. The British Government has the right to do so in accordance with the Treaties concluded between it, Iraq and the Sheikh of Koweit, The above is briefly ray opinion explained to you, and I am prepared to give you any further details which you consider necessary with a view to take a decision on this matter. Please accept my esteemed respect. (Sd) AHM3D ROUSHDI« 1.7.38.i By Air Mail.

The two headings on which it has been agreed that compensation can be paid are (a) Istihlak tax paid by merchants who exported from Iraq dates grown on the Sheikh's gardens, and ( b ) Istihlak tax paid by the present Sheikh on produce exported to ICoweit for his household consumption. 2. The figures supplied by Sheikh /.hmad on these heads are as follows: 1932-33 1934 1935 1936 Total I. D. I. D. I.D. I.D. I*D. (a) 1872.7^6 588.585 747.618 1830. 870 5039-819 (b) 180.138 89.948 58.910 6U.58a 393.580 5- '5433.109 1 HI i»e. an average of nearly £1,100 a year. These figures were supported by particulars of individual transactions and the Embassy and the Political Resident consider that they can be accepted as reliable. 3. It should be noted that these figures are for all the gardens belonging in 1914 to Sheikh Mubarak. These gardens do not belong to the present Sheikh alone and are apparently in no case registered in his name. Tv/o-thirds of the gardens belong to a^l the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak, and the remaining third belongs to his male heirs only and their descendants. /tfz. descendants. All the estates are, however, a dmi nistered 'by the ruling Sheikh on behalf of his co-heirs. The political Agent in Koweit has explained that their arrangement has heen made with the consent of the heirs, but without any written authority from them. The estate is not a private waqf . i-l-. It is a qaestion for consideration whether the 1914 pledge can be taken to cover the whole estate or only the present Sheikh's part in it. The India Office consider that the pledge covers all the date gardens which belonged to Sheikh Mubarak in 191^- until they pass out Of the possession of his heirs by their voluntary act, and it would in practice seem difficult to take any other line in view of the decision reached regarding the heirs of Sheikh Khazal (cf. see below). B. Properties owned in 1914 by Sheikh Khazal of Moham marah . 5. The headings under which it has been decided that compensation is due are (a) Istihlak duty on dates sold to merchants for consumption in Iragj and (b) Istihlak duty paid on dates exported from Iraq. 6. The figures supplied by Sheikh Khazal ? s agent are as follows: 1932 1933 1934 1935 Total (a) 531.435 1,229.000 1,167.202 1,092.029 4,015.866 (b) SU? • 836 357.l4.9i1 - - 1,005-530 5,025-436 i.e. an annual average loss of rather more than I.D. 1,250. 7./7. These figures were not supported by details of the individual transactions, 'but in 1934 the Sheikh's agent informed the Embassy that he would obtain certificates if desired in respect of the dates sold in Iraq. He also said that he could produce customs documents in respect of the dates shipped abroad. The Embassy reported, however, that it would in any case be impossible to verify these figures without an exhaustive examination of the books kept by the agent, as, although proof might be forthcoming that he had actually sold on behalf of the Jheikh the quantities of dates mentioned in the claim, there would be no certainty that they ^were the produce of the exempted gardens or that they did not include the value of the produce purchased by the agent from the share of the date crop of the cultivators of the estates. In addition, they pointed out that the claim was in respect of a quantity considerably larger than that covered by the similar claim of the Sheikh of Koweit, although the exempted estates of the latter were assessed (they did not say when) by the revenue authorities of the Iraqi Government as having twice the bearing capacity of the former. -i-'he position therefore is that there is reason not to accept without verification the annual figures produced b Sheikh Khazal's agent; but that these figures have not been challen ,ed and that His Majesty's Government do not seem to be in a position to produce alternative figures of their own. 8. it seems difficult merely to fix the amount of compensation as half the figure accepted in the case of Sheikh Mubarak's gardens without further enquiry, since if this procedure were questioned by the heirs or others interested in their affairs it would appear somewhat high-handed. Moreover, the administration of Shei:;h Khazal's estate/^ u estate has no .7 been talcen over 'by the 'Minors' Administration' in Iract, and it might cause resentment if figures supported 'by a semi-public institution of the kind were left out of account. 9. Two courses seem open; (a) to assess the compensation due on the val ue of the gardens as compared with those of Sheikh Mubarak's gardens. In that case the Embassy could be asked when the land assessments to which they referred in 1934 were made? and whether there are any more recent assessments. Or (b) to endeavour to check the actual loss incurred by the estate. There is working in Iraq a firm of chartered accountants of high standing (Messrs. Vhinney Murray and Company) who might be able to undertake the task of checking the figures and documents produced by the former agent or by the 'Minor's i-idmini strati on'. If all that is desired is to 2^1: a reliable figure for the average annual loss (cf. below) it would not seem to matter which years were taken for review by the accountants5 and, although some expense would be involved, it should be possible to reach an acceptable figure in this way. 10. It has already been decided that the heirs of Sheikh Khazal are to be treated no less favourably than he would himself have been if he were still alive? i.e. compensation is to be paid in respect of the whole gardens./- ill, Method jDf cal culating com pensat ion . 11. 'r.vo methods have been suggested - (a) that rlis Majesty's Government should repay the annual proved loss since 1932 plus a lump sum representing so many years 'purchase' of the current annual loss, or (b) tnat they should pay a single lump sum representing an increased number of years 'purchase'. 12. The course at (b) seems preferable ? as less likely to involve bargaining and disputes. It would seem to have an additional advantage in vie 1 ;/ of the uncertainty as to the losses actually incurred in the past in the case of Sheikh Khazal's estates (cf. above). 13' The number of years purchase and the rate of interest to be allowed on outstanding capital have als ;&gt; to be fixed. 11+. It has throughout been hoped and assumed that the fact that His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay compensation will have a beneficial effect on their relations with the Sheikh of Koweit. Clearly, however? the effect will not be so great if the offer is not accepted-; by him on the ground that it is too small, and in fixing the compensation to be offered it may be advisable^ not only to fix the minimum figure, but to take account of the fact that a more advantageous offer may have to be made if the minimum figure can be shown on reasonable grounds to be unacceptable.- 7 - (5) Method of P ayment . A. Sheikh Mubarak ' s Estat es^ 15. V/hen the Foreign Office wrote to the Treasury in December lasc 5 it v/as believed that all the estates were registered in the name of the present Sheikh and belonged to him, and it was therefore assumed that any payment made would be to him alone. It was also proposed that he should sign a statement recognising the payment as full discharge in respect of our liability. 16. It is a question how far this procedure will have to be revised now. There appear to be two courses open to us (assuming that compensation is not confined to the present Sheikh's share in the estates, in which case the original procedure would undoubtedly apply):- (a) To find out the proportionate interest of each heir in the estates, make a separate payment to them all and obtain individual discharges, or (b) To pay the whole amount to the Sheikh and get a discharge from him alone. In this case certain verbal alterations would have to be made in the form of discharge. 17. The Foreign Office consider that, as our obligation to Sheikh iviubarak as a result of v/hich compensation Y /as payable was an international obligation and not one of which any municipal court anywhere could take cognisance anc as His Majesty's Government need not, politically speaking, concern themselves with the affairs of any of the heirs other than the ruling Sheikh, it does not matter who signs the discharge as long as it is signed by him. There would, therefore, seem to be no objection to adopting course (b), which is also much the more convenient, if, indeed, course (a) can be regarded as practicable at all. 18. If18. if this is done, then the form of discharge might be amended to read as follows;- 11 1 in my own name and in the name TI of all other persons inheriting property from the n late Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit, do hereby acknowledge 'the receipt of the sum of paid to me on TT behalf of His ilajesty's Government in the United ;T Kingdom, and I recognise this payment as a full 'discharge, binding equally on me, my heirs and 'successors, and on the other heirs of Sheikh Mubarak 'with their heirs, of the liability of that.Government, 'under the pledge given to Sheikh Mubarak in 1914, to 'compensate us for the loss we have suffered since 1932, 'or may suffer in the future, by reason of the Istihlak 'or any other tax hereafter levied on landed property 'or agricultural production in respect of lands which we 'hold in Iraq as heirs of Sheikh Mubarak, and in view of 'this payment made to me for myself and for the other 'heirs 1 guarantee His Majesty's Government against any 'liability towards the ether heirs of Sheikh Mubarak in 'respect of such taxation'. 3o Sheikh IChaza 1 's E state s , 19. This case is unfortunately much more complicated. The distribution of compensation and the discharge, if any, to be given depends on whether or not we can regard compensation as an ex_ grati a payment. As in the case of the pledge to Sheikh Mubarak, the obligation to Sheikh Khazal was not one of which any municipal court anywhere could take cognisance, and the Foreign Office are inclined to the viev/ that it probably lost any legal force it ever had when Sheikh/■ - 9 - Sheikh Khazal ceased to be in any sense an independent ruler. If this view is correct ? any compensation paid by His Majesty's Governuient is legally an ex gratia payment 5 and they can legally pay what they like and divide it exactly as they like. Further, since the heirs who will be receiving the benefit of the compensation have no recourse open to them except complaint either directly or indirectly to His Majesty's Government, it does not seem to be legally necessary to secure their agreement to the amount paid or to the arrangements made for distribution, and it might even be argued that it is not even absolutely essential to obtain aiy sort of receipt or discharge from them. 20. It would, however, be very laborious for His Majesty's Government to endeavour to distribute the money fairly themselves. Unfortunately efforts made to induce the various heirs to agree to the establishment of a family w aqf with the responsible head of which negotiations could have been conducted; have proved unavailing. Moreover the former agent of Sheikh Khazal, who had authority to negotiate on behalf of a majority of the .heirs, has recently thrown up his position in despair at the behaviour of certain of the heirs, and the estate has now been taken over by the 'Minors* :i Administration' . Assuming that any payment made is legally ex fer atia, however, all that His Majesty's Government have to do would seem to be to notify the ''-linors'Administration' that they are prepared to pay in £ j L to the estate and^-ask them to submit an equitable scheme of distribution, saying nothing about any form of discharge other than a mere receipt. If the scheme of distribution were considered satisfactory, His Majesty's Government could then pay over the money, and that would/- 10 - ' would be the end of the story. It would not even, strictly speaking, be necessary for His Majesty's Government to be informed of the scheme of distribution, except as a means of enabling them to satisfy themselves that the money would be properly used. 21. It is of course conceivable that the 'Minors' 'Administration' would refuse to accept the money, even although no sort of condition was attached to its payment. In that rather unlikely event, His Majesty's Government would have to consider the matter again, 22. If, however, it is thought desirable to obtain some sort of assent from the heirs, His Majesty's Government will have to ascertain who they now are, and obtain from each of them, if they could not get the 'Minors' Administration' to do this for them, their assent to the proposition that the money should be distributed in the manner proposed, and further that they accepted the share to be allotted them as discharge of ail their claims. Such assent might be forthcoming ii they were flatly -cold that unless they all signed no money would be forthcoming to any of them, but it is to be feared that in view not only of the number but of th financial position and character of the heirs it wpuld be very difficult in practice to do this and would almost certainly take a long time. 23. A further complication arises with regard to the actual distribution of the money if an attempt is made to carry this out on more legal lines. In that case His Majesty's Government would apparently have to make a distinction/I ^ - 11 - distinction between (a) the portion of the sum. representing taxation from 1932 up to the date of the death of Sheildi iChazal and (b) the rest. (a) would go to the person responsible for winding up the Sheikh's estate and he would have to include it in the assets in his hands for paying the creditors of Sheikh Khazal in the first place, and in the second place for the distribution ox the balance of assets among the heirs. (b)j on the other hand, should be regarded as not having accrued until after Sheikh IChazal's death and therefore as having really passed to his heirs with the lands which they inherited. It would accordingly not be liable to Sheikh Khazal's debts, but the creditoi's of the individual heirs would no doubt take steps to get hold of it as soon as it reached their hands. A serious practical objection to this course is that if it were adopted it would be impossible to make a single lump sum payment in respect of the whole compensation (cf. above)./'I - 12 - (4) C ornmuni c at ion to be made to I ra qi. G ov eriLrien t. 24. It is admitted that it would be impossible to keep secret from the Iraqi Government any payment of compensation, and in any case the Treasury consider it necessary to notify them of such payment officially, since it is held that they are bound by the 1930 Treaty to implement the undertakings ^iven to the Sheikhs, and that His Majesty's Government have the ri^ht to recover from them any money paid to the extent of losses actually suifered, and it mi^ht prejudice that ri^ht not to inform the Iraqi Government. 25. The relevant part of the 1936 note to the Iraqi Government is;- '6. As regards (b) (taxation), the 'proposals of His Majesty's Government are the IT follo'./ing&lt;• They are prepared to make no further 'claim against the Iraqi Government for the 'exemption of the properties of the tv/o Sheikhs 'from taxation in Iraq provided that the Iraqi 'Government will,, for their part, '(a) Give a formal undertaking, in writing, 'to make no claim for arrears oi taxation against 'either Sheikh in respect of their properties in 'Iraq, and. '(b) Provide a formal written assurance 'that no discriminatory taxation will be imposed 'upon the properties of either in future'. 26. Presumably, the communication to the Ira-qi Government will have to be somewhat on the following lines^ that His Majesty's Government feel it inequitable that compensr?tio-n for the losses suffered in respect of Istihlak tax/- 13 - tax on the two Sheikhs' properties should be longer witheld, and that they have therefore decided to pay compensation themselves on such and such a basis; that they reserve the right to reclsum from the Iraqi Government the sums to be paid to the estates of the two Sheikns but that they will refrain from making such a claim if agreement on the whole question of the Sheikhs 1 properties, as regards both possession end.taxation, can be reached on the lines proposed in the 1936 note, which otherwise remains unchanged. 27, The Embassy have recently reported that the Iraqi Government have prepared a draft reply to the 1936 note, which with one important exception (which the Iraqi Government are now considering anew) appears on the wliole satisfactory. It is of course very desirable that His Majesty's Government should reach agreement with the Iraqi Government about the question as a whole, and a communication about compensation on the lines suggested above might prejudice the chances of a satisfactory reply ever being delivered, because the Iraqi Government may regard it as high-handed of Eis .lajesty's Government to pay, at a level fixed by themselves, compensation which they claim to be an obligation incumbent on the Iraqi Government, and because they may be advised that the action of His Majesty's Government in so doing weakens the claim of His Majesty's Government to recover such compensation from them, 28, The plan of separating the 'taxation' from the 'possession^ is^ue was adopted because of the apparent IdCk of//o&gt; - 14 - of all reasonable prospects that trie Iraqi Government would accept the comprehansive proposals of 1936, without bringing in extraneous matters such as smuggling from Koweit, but in view of their recent move, it would be well, while pushing forward with all necessary preliminary enquiries and arrangements, to give the Embassy time to make a further effort to bring the Iraqi Government into line about the comprehensive proposals before any communication on the lines proposed above is made to them.By Air Mail. 9i\ u INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, J 6 AUGBjJ Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

J / Dear Gibson, In our official letter E4158/28/93 of the 22nd July you were sent a copy of Baxter's letter to Houstoun- Boswall at Bagdad about the Sheikh of Koweit's date garden at Bashiyah. I now enclose a copy of Houstoun-Boswall*s rep:L (4&gt; r jT^V 1 ' 1 2. You will see that in paragraph 5 hefcefers to a despatch from Powle (No. 407-S of the 19th July) enclosing a further detailed statement from the Sheikh's lawyer. I think it will be best if we reserve our final comments on Houstoun-Boswall's letter until we have seen Fowle's despatch. ';wi 3. There are, however, two subsidiary points that I might make now. The first is that we have now sent off yf* 10$ a telegram authorising Houstoun-Boswall to accept the Iraqi redraft of their note about the application of land settlement procedure (paragraph li). The other is that he does not seem Quite fair to Ahmed Rushdi in paragraph 7(b), since the latter in his various memoranda to the Courts did in fact argue the case on its merits as well as deal with the points of international law. Yours ever, (Sd) Lacy Baggallay. J .P .GIBSON, ESQ.1' Batiijah, had apparantly given her share of the property as a security for a debt ana the creditor is no* foreclosing on tne crop. ^ CiQ s . alr.ee received Fowle's So. 407-S of the 19th July which covers a detailed (but not vtry concistj) statement prepared by Abdul Jalil, the Shaikh's lawyer at liasra. This shows that Abdul iiaqi (or Baqui), one of the dead brothers of the five sisters riientioned above, also had a share which was sold to Mubarrak; a suit for his share may be put forward by s aebody. I cannot say who his heirs are. Possibly his shares all go to the five sisturs. 6. l&lt;ow about giving advice to the Shaikh. ThU seems to oe mainly a job for a lawyer; the casu is very comoilcated ana ^ ao not think that any laymen*s opinion on the legal issues would be of much value. Abdul J %lil Partu seems to have appreciated tha position pretty well in narbgrapheS-^r'^ and 3 of his aoovementioned letter to de (iaury of the 18th June. • 1 iThough you will notice that Drower in the note enclosed ^ A c ^ 4 in our despatch No. 431 of the 26th July, 1935 (paragraph l) f does not support Jalil's opinion that the five sisters can also sue the Shaikh for the produce of the Bashlyah date treesy. He has three propose s: (a) To figLt a legal rearguard action against ahidah on the success or which he nas little hope. (b; To bank on the Court of Appeal upholding the political pleas or the Shaikh^s lawyers In the i^addaghiyah case and then to fight the Bashiyah claimants with that judgment. (c) To let Bashiyah go and to recover the purchase price from/10./ Ill trom the haire of All Paei a Zuhalr and his wife Sbaflqah. ^ (a) It soams doubtful whether (a) is worth while, s cittfee is not importMnt• 'i'he whole .baahlyah property is only about 30 Jaribs and iahijah's share of this year's crop cannot be very much* (b) We do not tLink there is a ghost of a chance of the Court of Appeal taking any notice of the political arguments of Maitre Ahmed Kuahdi. He would have done far oattar to have argued tLe case on ita legal points and his enormous rees to my mind were just mona./ thrown down the drain. -Any*ay, our plan for the i^addaghlyah case is to stop the appeal altogether by having Land Settlement declared and, if wa succeed, there will be no Appeal judgment with which to fight tne Bashlyah claimants. vc; «'• are thus left with co rse (o) which really seems to be the only one to taka. 8. To sum up, we agree witn you that it is no good to try delating tactict. (x.a. anything like trying to oersuada the Iraqi Government to intervene and stop court proceedings) and that the only thing the Shaikh can do is to allow the »aihiyah siits to proceed and abide by the results. ii ne los ^a tne property, he can then institute proceedings to r-cover the purchase price waiob would seem to be greater tnan tne present value of th« £3 » 100 a 6 againat (seu Humphry a f cieso^tch Ho. 389 of the 17th June, 1933). iha question or whether His Majesty's aovemrnent should pay any oom;ensation lor tne property can be settled when it seef tio* much oX the purchase price the Shaikh eventually recovers*10« As to how the Shaikh s ould rim the esse for recovering the purchase money, we woutld suggest that Drower* s point sh uld be put to Jalll and his advice taken. If his advice cannot be trusted tt en the Shal tb should aopolnt another lawyer. / 3^ A proflOo, I aopw you wil^ be/able to hasten an acceptance - oi the f annul a given In our telegram No. Ill of the 2l:nd July about the application of Land Settlement to the Shaikh's properties. Otherwise, there is a danger of Faddaghlyah going trie way of iiasnlyah. Xou suggested more use of the Consul at Basra. Biri^kell was often consulted, but he is away, and. If I were to consult Hawrl*. Le would only go to AMul JaliX and got the earae views at tnoas in the letter's letter of the 18tb June to de usury. There is no iiritisn Ju^e there no» - CJood is on leave. 1 do not think therefore that it would serve much purpose to consult Harris, unless there is some oartioular point upon which you want information. is. If ,ou have any more conundrums, plesso write. The temperature is about 115 in the shade, but we will do our best. 14. A final point. /ou say in your letter tnat 'there seems to be something of a drive against the Shaikh Ju.t now'. 1 know that ttUnga have been hapoening which give some reason for sueh an idea but examination of these ha ^enings reveals quite different causes. The cases of the cutting down of the date trees anc the aeUure of a plot of land at ,'ao art, now 6Ii own to be due to the activities of the Britisn officials at the Basra Port and nothing really to do with the Iraqi Oovernment/lO Oovernment. 15. Trie Basniyali cae« I b nothing n«w. Tha lawyers i^ve bean having t elr fan out of it for years and iteddaghiyah is in tb« sanie class. 16. Suggestions that the recent revolution in Koweit w s due to Iraqi 'propaganda' and not to any real Koweiti dissatisfaction witu the Shaikh's misrule seem to me to be tandantious and ill-founded and the story that the Iraqis nad put up boundary pillars in Koweiti territory is shown on enquiry to be quite untrue. 17. I think therefore tnat it would be unfair if the views of His Majesty 's 3overnt;ient on questions about Koweit which involve the Iraqi Oovern.uent stiould be coloured with the id^a that tne Iraqi UoverniBent are organising a drive against Koweit.

A Dear Gibson, Will you please refer to my letter E4571/26/93 of 11th August about the Sheikh of Koweit's date garden i — * at Bashiyah. '(- / 2* We have now considered the correspondence from Bushire enclosed in your official let'ter P»Z»5547/38 of ^&gt;1%? f'/PO 9th August. Abdul Jalil's letter of 18th June in particular seems to make the position a good deal clearer# 3. On the whole we agree with Houstoun-Boswell 1 s comments on the three possible courses of action which Abdul Jalil suggests in paragraph 3, Course (b) - to try and reopen the decision in favour of Rafiyah in the Bahiyah case if, on the issue of international law, the Court of Appeal decides in favour of the Sheikh in the Faddaghiyah case - is really out of the Question, not only because such a decision in the Paddaghiyah case is unlikely, but because we are now arranging for the proceedings to be stayed and land settlement applied# It is our view that, sooner or later, the Sheikh will have to fall back on course (c) - suing the vendors of the Bashiyah estate for the return of the original purchase money. 4« However, the order of the Chief Officer of Executions attaching part of the Bashiyah estate for a debt owed by Bahijah, although the Sheikh was in possession of the property and Bahijah had got no decision of the Court to show that any part of it really belonged J.P.Gibson, Esq.J 'l to her, seems high-handed, if not illegal, and we see no harm in the Sheikh trying to upset that order in the Courts (Abdul Jalil ! s course (a)), as long as it is made clear to him that in our view his ultimate goal must he course (c). I do not know whether it would 'be possible for the Sheikh to get the property counter^-attached, so to speak, as security for the return of the purchase money. But it seems clear that he and his lawyers must use every loop—hole the Iraqi law allows until the settlement procedure takes effect.

(2) If it is proved that the whole or part of the land has been exploited for a period of 15 years prior to the installa tion of the pump and that there is an agreement relating to the exercise of the right of possession in the land by the pump-owner and another party but not including all the original cultivators, the said agreement shall be considered as null and viod with regard to usufruct unless it is agreed to by those who have not signed it, in which case the provisions of para 3 of this Article shall apply.

A' May I add another point which Houston-Boswell has overlooked. It was desirable to offer the services of a good foreign lawyer, if only to try to give to the Ruling family of Kuwait that confidence, which delays for some twenty years in the settlement of this case in Iraq^has taken away. The Ruler preferred, he said, a sound Egyptian lawyer to any Iraqi and as Maitre Ahmad Rushdi was selected by the Cairo Embassy, and I understand Sir Miles Lampson took a personal interest in the matter, he must be considered a good selection. 2# Personally I have little doubt that the Sheikh would have been made to lose his case whoever had been employed, but whatever the effect of the employment of Maitre Ahmad Rushdi may have been elsewhere, I can speak for the efiect here. It was excellent. His Majesty's Government were considered to have done the right and generous thing and I believe in view of the increasing interest in London (Vide leading article in n The Times' 1 ) on the subject it may be that it will be found xater most useful that a man of the calibre of Ahmad Rushdi, selected by our Embassy in Cairo, was employed.

I incline to think that the explanation of the delay will be found therein. He intended to have the usufruct of the estate this year, by attachment, before and without service of judgement i.e.without opening the road to us for an appeal. 5 # I presume that the service of Judgement, must now take place, once the yea^s crop has been sold, and the court fees paid.

Al-Shawwaf has attached the produce of Palm-trees, owned 'by my clients, Shaikh Ahmed Al-JaMr Al-Subah and Partners, according to Tapu documents Nos. 13,14,15,16,17, and 18 of August 1916. The said lawyer recognises the said properties, as 'being secured hy the said Tapu Documents, and that they are under the hands of my clients who were in complete possession during a time which exceeds the limits of the passage of time law, as he had filed a suit No. 373 of 1932 in the Court of Instance, Basra, for nullifying the said documents. He obtained a Judgement, 'but he did not serve it on my clients. It is clear that a Judgement cannot he executed without 'being served on the defendents, and it cannot take its final effective form unless the law. As the said lawyer did not serve the said Judgement on my clients, so as to enable us to find ways of contesting it through the proper channels of the law, it becomes impossible to put such a Judgement into effect, and accordingly it also becomes impossible to obtain an attachment over a property which is still registered, in the Tapu Department, in the names of my client and partners, and whose documents have not actually become null and void. I, therefore, ask for an order for removal of the attachement which took place. I beg to say that I understand that Lawyer Sulaiman through the proper channels of05/11 Telegram R.

Will you please refer to Fowle s express letters d/Jb4 of 21st June and 406-S of 19th July a'bout the felling of a number of date-trees on the Sheikh of Koweit's estates at Fao ? 2. I discussed the matter with Ward when he called at the Foreign Office some days ago. Ward says (in strict confidence) that the road was urgently needed, and that Coster went ahead when he was told 'by the Mudir that there was no ob jection. It would have involved intolerable delay if the permission of the owner had 'been sought. Ward added that the Port authorities did not know that the land in question was claimed 'by the Sheikh. It apparently lies outside the bund, which the British forces - to Ward's own recollection - built in 1916, and if it belongs to the Sheikh must certainly have been 'jumped' by him since then and a fortiori since 1914. The Port authorities have always envisaged having to pay compensation to the owner when it was established v/ho it was. Anyway the date palms, which grow in brackish water, are of the poorest variety, do not produce dates fit for export, and can be worth very little. 3. It is possible that the Mudir has some kind of standing authority to cut down trees at his discretion in order to make roads. If so, the limits within which he should act must have been laid down, and it must in particular have been specified whether or not compensation to the landowner is due. 4. If, however, this is not the case, and if the proceedings by the Mudir or Coster, or both, were simply illegal, Iraqi Law will presumably provide a remedy, either against the individuals responsible, or possibly (though we doubt if this is likely) against the Government. 5. V/e feel here that some action should be taken now W.E. Houstoun-Boswall Esq., M.C., if &gt; / Bagdad.rut 2. if the Sheikh 1 s claim is not to go 'by default. No doubt, in normal circumstances, the proper course, if liability to compensation in such cases is admitted, would be for the Sheikh to apply for his compensation by whatever is the normal procedure. In this case presumably to the Port administrat ion who apparently agree that compensation is payable by them to the owner. In the absence of dispute, the normal procedure would not, we imagine, be the institution of legal proceedings, but if the authorities were to dispute the Sheikh^ title, then the matter would no doubt have to be decided by the competent court. Alternatively if the Government disclaim responsibility for the action of their officials, andlthe Sheikh's remedy is a-claim against the Mudir or Coster, he would have to take the matter to the competent court straight away. 6. Y/e do not of course want to run the risk of the matter coming before a court just when we are getting the Iraqis to apply Land Settlement to the Sheikh's estates, and the alternative seems to be to take the matter up through the diplomatic channel. If the Sheikh's title is so uncertain that he would be ill-advised to go to court, it would be rather difficult for us to take the matter up on the footing that he has a clear case for compensation. It would anyv/ay be rather premature to lodge anything like a formal diplomatic claim against the Iraqi Government at this stage, but we think you should make enquiries as to the position. Prima facie this would be quite natural, since both the persons involved in the destruction of the trees are officials of the Iraqi Government. Unless you see objection, therefore, we shall be grateful if you will now draw the attention of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to what has happened, and try to find out if they are prepared to pay compensation; if so, how much; and if not, why not.fk-) 5* 7. An alternative, which you might consider, is that the Sheikh should claim compensation as the owner from the Port Authorities, and the latter should reply- that they are prepared to pay compensation to the owner (and perhaps say how much) hut cannot pay it to the Sheikh until his owner shi , is established. Then we could let the matter rest there till the Land Settlement procedure is under way, possibly informing the Iraqi Government of the position and saying that the Sheikh will let the matter rest till his title is confirmed by the Land Settlement procedure, and then claim. This would, of course, only be worth doing if you could make sure that the Port Authorities would in fact be prepared in principle to pay compensation and free to do so and would not disclaim all liability.

The Sheikh told me that he had no objection, and he also told his Agent so early in February; however many trees on two other quite different parts of the same estate, as well as on the part mentioned in the Mudir's letter, were cut down at the end of April, as has been reported. (b) The Port authorities and their local official, do know that the land in question %.s claimed by the Sheikh.

The photographs enclosed show the gardens, and how the roads were widened into them. 3. Moreover while Ward was in London, the acting Director of the Port (Garstin) wrote to the Iraq Ministry of Finance fully admitting the error of the Port, in cutting down these trees without authority. In consequence the Mutassarrif of Basra has since received instructions to form a committee to assess the amount of compensation which the Port should pay to the Sheikh. 4. In a letter dated the 27th September, he informed the Acting Director of the Port of the Committee's formation, and requested the fixing of a date for its enquiry and I presume that in due course, if there is no intervention, the amount of conpensation will be assessed and paid.i 1 1$ Confidential , Office of the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf, Camp, Kuwait, D^0,No.C/769 .

It seems to me rather unfortunate that there has been a delay in getting this question under weigh.

With regard to the merits of the case, nothing in Ward 1 s statement to Baggallay can get over the fact that the Basrah Port Authorities, without inaking proper enquiries as to whanthe land belonged and thereafter approaching the owner for permission, acted in an extremely arbitrary way, the result of which was considerable damage to the Shaikh's property. 4, de Gaury tells me that on the 27th September Garstin, who was then acting as Director of the i J ort in Ward's absence. Informed him - de Oaury - that he / J. P. Gibson Esquire, The India Office, London.s- he - aarstin - had written to the Iraq Ministry of Finance admitting the error of the Port in cutting down the trees in question without authority. In consequence of this the i£utassarrif of Basrah had received instruc tions to xonn a Caminittee to assess the amount of compensation which the Port should pay to the Shaikh, The Mutassarrif informed him - CJarstin - of the Committee's formation, Garstin shov/ed the correspondence in question to de Gaury. 5. This is satisfactory, but at the same time in order to keep the local Iraqi authorities up to the mark I think it would be advisable for the Embassy to take the matter up with the Iraq Government.

This suggestion, however, is not a new one. You will see that it was put forward at an inter-departmental meeting held at the Foreign Office in April/ The Hon. Lt.Col.Sir T.C.W.Fowle, KCIE., CBE., * K.B.M's Consulate General, Bushire.2. P h-te' April last at which you were present - see paragraph 7 of the final record of the meeting, a copy of v/hich was sent to Bushire with India Office letter No. P.Z.5494/38 of 12th August, - and prima facie it would seem a reasonable suggestion that in calculating the compensation payable to the Sheikh, regard should 'be had to the 'best rates of interest consistent with first class security which he would expect to get by investing his money in the neighbourhood• It is true that the Treasury^ idea of a payment based on 11 years' purchase is lov/er than that v/hich we or the Foreign Office had in mind; on the other hand your suggestion^that the Trustee rate of interest (i.e. approximately 29 years' purchase) should be used as the basis of calculating the proposed payment seems very much on the high side and unless we can produce strong arguments in its favour we feel some reluctance about putting your view to the Treasury. It has been agreed that there should be no bargaining with the Sheikh and that when the time comes he should be told that His Majesty's Government are prepared to pay £x v/hich/— —— .1^ yZ 3. r-S which they consider a fair settlement of their ^obligations. At the meeting held on the 21st April last i- you expressed the opinion that if the sum offered was reasonably generous and one which His Majesty's Government were satisfied in their own minds was fair, there would 'be no undue risk of the Sheikh refusing to accept. What therefore we have to do is to agree between ourselves upon a figure which fulfils these conditions. The Treasury have had the first round and since the liability is theirs they have, perhaps not unnaturally, started at the bottom of the scale. What we should like to do now is to go back to the Treasury with a figure which you and we here are agreed would be an equitable compromise, and as indicated above v/e ourselves find it difficult to dispute the view that in calculating the sum to be paid, regard should be had to the rates of interest obtainable in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. The Treasury have suggested taking for this purpose the higher rate of 9% mentioned by the Baghdad Embassy, but in our view it would seem more reasonable to adopt the Iraq legal rate of 7% as a basis, which in round figures would permit compensation/IT 4. compensation to 'be calculated on a 15 years* purchase* Would you be so good as to consider the matter again and let us have a further expression of your views in the light of the ahove. If you still feel that even a r f% rate is too high, we will of course put your view to the Treasury, 'but I anticipate that it will require some very convincing arguments to persuade them that anything in the region of the Trustee rate of interest would be justified• iyrlLeX. cscr/u-f $1. ^ ^ L \ sAI fx 33^0/3$ S.32453/15 Treasury, 3.W.I. 12th May, 1938. ^ Dear Baxter, • .T'U I am sorry to have kept for so long the draft record of ouy meeting of the 21st April about the date gardens. You will remember that at that meeting I said that we would consider further the method to be adopted in assessing the compensation to be paid in the light of any relevant precedents that might exist, for example, the commutation of perpetual pensions. ^he general principles governing the terms on which perpetual charges on the Consolidated Fund may be commuted are laid down in the Consolidated Fund (Perpetual Charges Redemption) Act, 1873, which provides that the Treasury may at any time contract for commutation by payment of a capital sum not exceeding such sum as will, according to the average price of Government securities at the date of such contract, purchase an amount of Government securities yielding annual dividends equal to the amount of the charge. It also provided that the Treasury must have regard to the contingengency (if any) of the determination of the charge. Within these limits, the endeavour has been to secure the best bargain for the taxpayer consistent with equity. Similar principles may be found in the Land Settlement Act 1919 and the Law of Property Act 1925 which deal with perpetual charges of other kinds not falling on the State. Under these statutes the Treasury have to prescribe the Government securities, the price of which is to govern the number of years' purchase for which the perpetual charges to which these Acts relate can be redeemed. The securities accordingly prescribed are four in number, namely 2-^% Consols, 3% Local Loans, 5^% Conversion Stock and 3i% War Loan. The average jdeld on these stocks at the price of the 6th May last was £3# 8. 3 per cent which would give 29^ years 1 / C.W. Baxter Esq., M.C., Foreign Office.I1 V 2. years* purchase. You will of course realise that the number of years purchase will vary according to the price of securities from time to time and that it is consequently possible to commute more cheaply when the prices of stocks are low than when they are high. Naturally, when the Treasury are commuting, we try to choose our moment. We have never gone above 27 years, at any rate since 1887, and two perpetual pensions were commuted in 1924 at 21 years 1 purchase, when the price of stocks was considerably lower than it is today. Prom this you will see that the principles upon which perpetual charges are commuted are fairly well established. The whole difficulty about the Sheikhs* case is that, while there is a perpetual obligation s there is no definite perpetual charge * 1 he obligation is in effect to make gbod the difference between the taxed and untaxed return on the gardens, whatever that may be. You will notice that the Act of 1873 obliges the Treasury to have regard, inter alia, to the contingency of the determination of the charge, and by the same reasoning we ought to have regard to the contingency of its reduction. We may leave aside the possibility that the present tax may be reduced or abolished, which may be set off against the risk of it being increased, and assume the tax to be permanent at the present ratei but even so, the difference between the taxed and untaxed return depends upon the amount of the return, and the amount of the difference cannot in our view be regarded as more certain than the amount of the gross return. The amount of the gross return itself may well be affected by a number of contingencies for which we have no responsibility, and which make the gardens less secure than a gilt edged investment. There may be labour troubles, or the price of dates may fall (and it is worth recalling in this connexion that the istihlak tax is an ad valorem tax) or the date palms may be damaged by pests or climatic changes. Any of these contingencies or others like them/lis 3. * them may reduce the productivity of the gardens, and in so doing would at the same time reduce the tax liability which is our responsibility. Logically, therefore we think that the amount to 'be offered should 'be the same number of years* purchase of the average loss over the last five years as that which the sum, which a purchaser of the gardens would offer, is of the average profits over the same period. In other words, if the average profits have been £10,000 and if a purchaser would offer £200,000, then we should properly commute a taxation loss of £1,000 by a payment of £20,000 - twenty years* purchase in each case. We appreciate of course that it is not practicable to ascertain the price which a purchaser would pay for these properties, but we think that the usual rate of interest on a sound mortgage in Iraq or the Persian Gulf region would give a pretty good indication of what the price might be expected to be, and so of the number of years* purchase which we ought to offer. For example, if the rate of interest commonly obtainable were 5% (l daresay it is much higher) that in our view would establish a prima facie case for taking 20 years. I return the draft record enclosed with your letter of the 27th April with a few suggested alterations in the margin. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibson. Yours sincerely, Sd. £. Halem lli (E 3748/28/93) Foreign Office, S.W.I* 1st July, 1938. r Dear Hale, With reference to your letter 3. 32453/15 of the 12th May about the date gardens, I write to let you know that we have now had a reply from the Embassy at Bagdad to our enquiry about the usual rate of interest on a sound mortgage in Iraq. 2. The Embassy say that as between Iraqis not less than 9% is in practice charged as interest on first- class mortgages. 3. A maximum rate of 7 c /o (Legal Interest Law: No. 17 of 1936) has, however, been fixed by law. The banks could not therefore charge a higher rate, but they do in fact charge 7% on overdrafts covered by first-class security, 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibson. Yours sincerely, Sd. Lacy Baggallay. E. Hale, Esq. Treasury,•1 b n TREASURY, S.W.I. S.32453/16. 24th August, 1938. Dear Grosthwaite, You rang up a few days ago to ask if we were now in a position to indicate what sum should 'be offered to the Sheikh of Kov/eit in respect of the Istihlak taxation on the produce ^ of his date-gardens in Iraq.. 2. You willreccllect that it was agreed tentatively f at the meeting on 21st April last as regards the nethod of calculating compensation that a single payment should 'be made and that the amount of the payment should 'be arrived at 'by adding to actual losses since 1932 sums sufficient to hring in an income equivalent to the average of the annual losses on the assumption that the sum would he invested at the hest rate of interest ohtainahle with good security in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf. 3. in agreeing to this arrangement Hale reserved the right to consider the position further in the light of pension commutation practice and any other relevant precedents. Subsequently in his letter to Baggallay oi 12th iv.ay, 1938, he drew attention to the contingencies v/hich must 'be taken into account in dealing with our obligations to the Shakh's and suggested that the proper course in the circumstances v/ould 'be to offer a sum which should be the same number of years 1 purchase of the average loss of the last five years as that whicn the sum vyhich. a purchaser of the gardens v/ould offer is of the average profits over the same period. Interest rates in Iraq and the Persian G-ulf regions were to be taken as a guide as to what number of years purchase should be taken for calculation purposes. purposes. P.M.Crosthwaite, Esq., Foreign Office.purposes. 4. As we expected, interest rates in Iraq and the Persian Gulf area are high and the information given in Baggallay's —- f m- letter of the 1st July last (E.3748/28/93 j suggests that the number of years' purchase to he taken for the ahove purpose should lie not more than eleven. There would indeed 'be justification for suggesting a lov/er figure than this if, as seems to 'be the case, the Sheikh could let out the compensation moneys on v/ell secured loans at rates of interest higher than --V , -- - ■ — I I III II I I r i) I I Iiii HI innwmnnmiumMnuiB^MWWI'lTBI' ' T' ^ ^ - 9%, except that at the meeting in April it was agreed that the sum offered must 'be reasonably generous so as to leave the Sheikh no good grounds for refusing to accept it. 5. On the above basis, the amount to be paid to the 'family council' referred to in paragraph 9 of the record of the meeting last April would be 11 x £1,087 = £11,957 - say £12,000. In addition there would be payable to the Sheikh himself the actual.losses from 1932 on account of taxation. 6. It would hov/ever be desirable, if the India Office and yourselves agree, to obtain Sir T.Fowle's views on the figure suggested. At the meeting he expressed the opinion that there should be no bargaining v/ith the Sheikh and it is essential therefore to ensure that there are no special local or political considerations which ought to be taken into account apart from local money rates. 7. Moreover before any offer is made however we should like to be^clear that the present litigation over the Sheikh's titles will not give rise to any later complications if compensation is now paid to him in respect of the Istihlak taxation. It appears from the latest information from the Embassy that a number of further suits against him have been filed and some of his titles seem to be of doubtful validity. The object of the commutation is to cover prospective payments of tax on the Sheikh'sIll * i 3. Sheikh's properties 'but if in fact he is dispossessed of part of them his liability is pro tanto reduced and in that case it is open to question whether a lesser amount than the £1,087 referred to above ought not to 'be taken as the figure representing future as distinct from past losses. 8. The importance of obtaining a full discharge of His Majesty's Government's liabilities v/hen the payment comes to be made will no doubt be borne in mind - see Hale's letter of 31st May 1938 (S.32453/15). ^ I have sent a copy of this letter to G-ibson. Yours etc. Sgd. P.G.Inch.'1 8 FOREIGN OFFICE, P. Z. 6304/38. S.W. L. 9th September, 1938. (E. 4999/28/93) ✓ I ^ ^ Dear Inch, i ' /' Many thanks for your letter S. 32453/16 of the 24th August ahout the sum to he paid to the Sheikh of Xoweit in respect of Islnlak taxation on the produce of his date—gardens. 2. Eleven years' purchase plus past losses is certainly rather lower than v/e had imagined here would 'be offered the Sheikh. However, we agree that it would he well to obtain Sir Trenchard Fowle's viev/s on the figure you sug est. He will no doubt say if he thinks that it is unlikely to prove acceptable. 3. In the last paragraph hut one of your letter you raise the question v/hether v /e will not he overpaying the Sheikh if we give him compensation now for the taxation on all the properties in his possession. In considering this, it is, v/e think, important to hear in mind the distinction between rightful possession and the fact of possession in 19|4. If the Sheikh 1 s title to any properties in the possession of Sheikh i.Iubarak in 1914 were shown, either in the Courts or by the uand Settlement Cominission, to be invalid, his liability to pay taxation would no doubt, as you say, be reduced. On the other hand, our liability under the 1914 Pledge, that we v/ould guarantee tax-free possession of the estates then in the possession of Sheikh Mubarak, v/ould still remain. We should therefore have to give him compensation for any losses he suffered by the decision of the Courts etc., and in assessing those losses v/e should have to bear in mind that tax-free possession is v/orth more than possession tout court . If we had already compensated him for the losses under taxation, v/e should have to pay him so much less. .G. Inch, Esq., Treasury.1 2. 4. There is, however, another possibility, and that is that the Sheikh may he shov/n to he now in possession, v/hether legally or not, of lands not occupied 'by Sheikh Mubarak in 1914. If this were the case, and if we had paid him compensation calculated on the 'basis of all his existing losses in respect of taxation, than we should in fact have paid him too much. There is, I think, no suggestion that the Sheikh has acquired any new properties in Iraq since 1914, but v/e do happen to /mow that in the opinion of Sir John Ward, the Director of the Port of Basra, etc. he has since then 'jumped' a certain amount of land 'betv/een the former 'boundary of the estates and the river. Ward said, indeed, that the particular piece of land that he had in mind produced the poorest quality of dates and v/as worth very little. But the possibility that v/e might to some extent he overpaying the Sheikh cannot 'be wholly ignored. 5. On the other hand, we must not, I thinic,forget that the sooner we pay, the cheaper for us, since if v/e wait until the Courts, etc. , have decided v/hat the real 'boundaries of the Sheikh's properties are, v/e shall no doubt have to add at least one or tv/o more years 'actual' losses to the 11-fold compensation in respect of future losses. As the question is in any case 'being referred to Sir Trenchard Powle, v/e feel here that he might 'be as-ced if he can throw any light on the alleged extensions of the Sheikh's properties since 1914 and their value. Subject to what he says, our view here is that it is not at all probable that the value of anjr land acquired by the Sheikh in this way is one- twentieth, let alone one-tenth, of the whole, so that it v/ould not seem v/orth while holding up payment even for a year in order to clear up this particular aspect of the matter.Minute Paper. € ^ ■ L P.Z. 6304/38. /?'

The next move is v/ith us and assuming that it is still|considered desirable to make an attempt to settle the taxation aspect v/ith the Sheikh separately from, and in advance of, the possession aspect, it would be useful to have the viev/s of Sir r ^.Fowle generally and in regard to the following specific points viz;- (1) Does the Resident agree v/ith the proposal that the amount of the payment to he made to the Sheikhly family should be arrived at 'by adding to actual tax losses since 1932 a sum sufficient to bring in an income equivalent to the average of the annual losses on the assumption that the sum would 'be invested at the best rate of interest obtainable v/ith good security in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf? (2) If the answer to (l) is in the affirmative v/hat are the viev/s of the Resident in regard to the/ 1212 5000 il/32V ■f.- n k the suggestions contained in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Treasury letter of 24th August at P. Z. 6990/38? It v/ill 'be noted that the Treasury have 'based their calculations on the higher figure of 9^; hut according to paragraph 3 of Mr.Baggallay 1 s letter of 1st July at P.Z.4613/38 the' maximum 1 ep:al rate of interest in Iraq is 7^ and this might he a more proper figure to work on. (3) If compensation in respect of taxation losses is paid now the payment must inevitably 'be 'based on taxable land now in the Sheikh's possession. Y/e shall therefore have overpaid him if he is subsequently dispossessed of any of his lands. Hewill, hov/ever, have to 'be compensated for such dispossessed property and in assessing the amount of such compensation we can, it is suggested, reasonably take into account the amount which was included in the taxation payment in respect of the alienated lands (see paragraph 3 of Foreign Office letter of 9th September at P.Z- 6304/38). But if we are to proceed on these lines perhaps something ought to be said to the Sheikh v/hen the tax compensation is paid. What are the Resident's viev/s? (4) It was tentatively agreed at the Foreign Office meeting held on 21st April 1938, that the lump sum 36 payment should be handed over to a 'family Council' set up by the Sheikh and not to the Sheikh personally. Since then we have, been informed (see copy of Captain de Gaury's letter at'p. ? Z.6292/38) that as part of the political reconstruction at Koweib it has been decided by the Sheikh that Sheikh Abdullah Salim (the President of the new Kov/eit Council) is to be inspector of the Suban estates and the accounts in this connection. Pre sumably this need not affect the idea of paying the money over to a 'family Council'? It is assumed that there is /—s i1 u test tell eikh cent sits nnec e * i.e. land actually inheritec from Sheikh Mubar£ Land acquired in any way since the pledge was given Ought to be excluded (see^, paragraphs 4 and Z of Foreign Office letter of 9th September at P.

A « (In his Expre^G letter No. C/76 : of l?th February 1938 at P.Z.1541/ 38-Col.17/8/(4) the Resident expressed the viev that v/hen the payment is made, , should obtain a discharge from the Sheikh and him alone.

What are the Resident's views in regard to this and also in regard to the suggestion that the payment in respect of actual losses incurred since 1932 should he paid to the Sheikh direct? (If a settlement is delayed much longer the sum due in respect of 'actual losses will soon he almost as hig as the proposed payment for 'prospective' losses). (5) Does the Resident agree with the proposed Gomi .Amication to the Iraqi Government - see r ffy » paragrapns 15 et seq. of the Record of the Meeting of 21st April?

I an afraid that I still disagree with the Treasury suggestion that the rate of interest should be that obtainable in Iraq on the grounds that that country is in the neighbourhood of the Persian Grulf # My reasons are as follows. (a) In the first place I do not see ^ay it should be assumed that the Subah family Council, to whom His Hajesty's Grovernment /s fu will pay the money, (vide paragraph 9 of the Becord of the Meeting of 21st April), should put this sum into Iraq, a country which they dislike and distrust - with some reason. (b) I think we should accept the principle that the Family Council should be expected to invest this money only In trustee stock; the Council are, of course, trustees for the whole family. It is obvious that even the so-called first class mortgages in Iraq do not fall in the class of trustee stock. (c) In so far as the argument of 'in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf - is concerned why choose Iraq? #lay not India, which is equally in this neighbourhood, and being British is surely a more suitable country to take as a basis for caloula- ti ons concerning the investment of money paid by His Majesty's Government than a foreign country like Iraq? In this connection / H.T.Peel Ssquire, M. C* , The India Office, London •-2- connection I sliould like to point out that the SBhrain (Jovernment ba/e invested their Reserve Fund, which is a large sum, in Govermaent of India War Loan Bonds at 3^#. I do not see any reason why the Family Council should be expected to invest their money less securely. (d) 30 fur as the Snaiich himself is concerned de Gaury informs me that his main fortune is placed in the Jastern, Ottoman and ULoyds 'Banks on fixed deposits at about 2^. I do not mean that we should take this low rate of interest as a basis for our calculations but it does show that the Shaikh does not turn to Iraq for making his investments. (e) With 1% taken as a basis the sua to be paid to the Shaikh to cover future taxation would be something over £ 15 f 000/-. Neither de (Jaury nor I think it likely that either the Lihaikh or the Subah Family would be satisfied with this, and, if I may quote a homely proverb H It is no good swallowing a rat and being choked by the tail 11 . The main object of compensating the Shaikh and the Subah Family is that they should be satisfied that th^r have had a fair deal from His Majesty^ Government and not be left with a feeling of grievance, and it would be a pity not to gain this object for the sake of a few extra thousand pounds. Moreover the contentment or otherwise of the Subah Family at the sum offered by His Majesty's Government will undoubtedly have repercussions in neighbouring States, e.g. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. (f) Though of course there will be no bargaining with the 3ubah Family as to the sum finally decided on nevertheles they will probably want, and should receive, some sort of explanation as to how our figure has been arrived at. With regard to past taxation this should not be difficult, but with /is 4 -5- with regard to compensation for future taxation I do not look forward to having to explain to them that we have based this on the maximum rate of interest allowed by Iraqi Law, 3# jfith regard to the figure whioh I think would be an equitable compromise / for which you ask me. In all the cir cumstances, and after discussion with de Gaury, I am of opinion that we should adopt 5;^ as the basis of our calculations, which makes a total sum as compensation for future taxation of about -•£ 21,000/-• To this of course would be added a sum to cover past taxation. # I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and de ' j -ajry t to tne latter of whom 1 have given a copy of your letter under reference and its enclosures, &amp;jc * sent under Printed letter No,C/786 of the 15th October 1938.v i ^ Confidential* Office of the Political Kesident in tho Persian Oulf t Camp, Kiavait* D # 0tNo.c/790» ,/ atod the 17th October 1958 # Ceroid you please refer to my dec inofficial letter to Peel Mo*c/ r /85 dated the 15th October 1958 on the subject of coraponoaticn to be paid to the Shaikh of ICiiwait for prospective loanes by tho taxation of his date .pardons in Imq* I v;ould bo fateful if the Oovermnont of India, if tbey see fit, coiad support the reconraendation mde in paragraph 3, for which personally I think there is an eroellent case# Pir Aubrey Metcalfe, ir'ClS. , CSI., m*, Secretary to the '-OYemien.:. of India, external Affairs Department, Hew iJ9lhi #?b || y Confidential * No.0/79b of 1936, Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp 9 Kuv7a it.
