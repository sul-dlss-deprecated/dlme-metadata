These negotiations have now broken down* It will be remembered that the Afghan Government failed to reply until August to the offer which H. M. G. had made in regard to these aircraft as long ago as last February. Further examination has revealed the extreme difficulty which would be experienced in providing spares for these old machines^ especially in view of the lapse of time since the offer was originally made. It appears that -the only practicable method would have been to keep in reserve a very large proportion of the aircraft themselves as a reservoir of spares, and this naturally depreciated the attractiveness of the bargain. Moreover, the Afghan Government wished to try out one of the Wapitis on approval before 4136b 1000 10.35 committing themselves to the purchase of the2 . rest, and since the Air Ministry, for various service reasons, could not see their way to fly this machine out to Kabul from Irak this would have led to a great deal of further delay in concluding the deal. As a result H.M. Charge d’Affaires, Kabul, has now reported (P.Z.6665/37) that, taking all considerations into account, the Afghan Government have in the end not decided/to purchase the Wapitis. k \ //C -3} A ^ A-'T^ 'V-, 40*^ s*’ # *&gt; -tJ- 'J- &lt; t^li^.

We rather support the Government of Indian view that . we shall be gaining little now by selling Wapiti aircraft to Afghanistan. The spares position's you know, is a very difficult one and we clearly do not want to sell a number of aircraft to Afghanistan, even at a bargain basement price, which are going to give relatively unsatisfactory service. It is certain^moreover, that they will compare very unfavourably with modern German or Italian types even if they would be^in our view y entirely adequate for the Afghan Government's requirements. As, however, the Afghan Government requires aircraft, in our view,more for window dressing than for actual operations, the fact that the aircraft waflucheap /mt out of date would have relatively little appeal. We think it might be possible to withdraw from this offer on the following grounds:- VtKtaVw*,- (i) The offer was made tentatively nearly a year ago when the aircraft were first taken from service and spares were available. (ii) During this year a number of available spares have been used up and the aircraft have been in storage^ so that a good deal of maintenance work would be necessary on them after delivery to Kabul, and they would be difficult to maintain subsequently owing to the probable absence of small but vital^maintenance spares. (iii) The offer of Wapitis was made when the decision of the Afghan Government to buy modern British military aircraft,and to consider the purchase of modern aircraft from other PowerSjWas in the earlier stages of discussion, and it was thought that an alternative to buying expensive new types might be the purchase of reasonable types then becoming obsolete in the Royal Air Force. /Having H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.Having said this we could say the aircraft are available, there is some life left in them; some spares no doubt could be obtained by only using half the total number for flying and reducing the others for use as spares, but the situation has really changed since the proposal was first made and §£ we really want to assist the Afghans we think it only right to point out the possible drawbacks of this purchase. From the Air Ministry point of view, of course, it is most desirable that the storage accommodation in Iraq now occupied by the Japitis should be released at a very early date. • In view of the terms of this letter I an not commenting in detail upon your draft telegram to the British Minister at Kabul as you advocate an entirely different policy, and I suggest that if you and Collier think it still desirable to push the sale we might meet soon to discuss the terms of a telegram to be sent to McCann at Kabul.

I doubt if this is a true statement of affairs.

The figures quoted above will probably be lower, in some cases, than cost of similar items supplied for the Hind aircraft which the Afghan Government have already purchased, but this is, of course, due to the fact that the ..apiti equipment is older than the Hind equipment. a.C.B. Symon, Esq., India Office, S.W.l.4. ’. ith regard to spare parts, the Director of Equipment states that no fabric parts for Wapitis are available for Afghanistan from E.-n-.E, stocks at home. In order to cover India 1 s needs in Wapiti spares for the next two years, it has been arranged with the Westland Aircraft Company (who built the aircraft) that they will retain the Wapiti Jigs and tools until information is received from the Air Ministry that they are no longer required, and can produce Wapiti parts provided ten months notice is given. This arrangement especially for India could be applicable also to Afghanistan. 5. As I mentioned to you earlier, there is a possibility that India could provide some fabric parts from stock, but tnis is a matter which they alone can decide. 6.

F* C* , Air Ministry, T.C.2*/ _v jr SECHET ^Dear AIR MINISTRY. ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. W.C.2. !1st September 1937. With reference to our telephonic conversation, and Humboldt demi-official letter P.Z.5644, dated 28th August. I have ascertained that the Air Ministry will have no objection to selling one Wapiti aircraft to the Afghan Government at once. 2. I am afraid, for various Service reasons, we cannot agree to Macann*s suggestion that the aircraft should be rigged in Iraq and flown to Kabul, and we suggest it should be freighted to Karachi as originally arranged, and flown on from there. The very fact that the Wapiti type of aircraft is in use in India now should convince the Afghans that they are a satisfactory type, and, of course, they will be quite serviceable when the depot at Karachi have erected them for final delivery. ith regard to the suggestion that by sending one Wapiti 4 ^ 7 from Iraq we could get an earlier decision regarding purchase of the remainder, we would suggest that by far the best scheme would be for one or more of the India Wapitis to be flown up to Kabul and demonstrated. Another scheme would be for Muhammed Ihsan, who, I believe, is on his way to India now, to visit a Wapiti squadron, or perhaps some of the Afghan pilots now under instruction in India could fly a Yiapiti. We agree that the early sale of Wapitis to the Afghan Government might forestall possible purchases of aircraft in Italy and Germany, and this is an additional reason for an early demonstration by one of the India units. 4. I have also been into the question of machine guns and bomb racks for Wapitis and the situation is as suggested in paragraph 4 of Humboldt letter. They would in this case be supplied from Air Ministry stocks. A.C.B. Symon, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.5. The spares question is being investigated, and I will let you know the result as soon as possible. As far as we can foresee at present the squadrons in India which now have Wapitis will be re-equipped about the end of 1938, when there should be a plentiful supply of spares, and, incidentally, more Wapitis. The Wapiti units at home will also be re-equipped about that time. 6. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Officeim»ia orrxoi.

I O T? i vI5 7.J With reference to your demi-official letter P.Z.5192/37 dated 11th instant, we agree to your draft letters to Hawkers and to the Government of India. 2 m We also agree to your note to the Afghan Minister, except that I am not clear that we are to send the Manuals to the British Legation at Kabul. In a letter dated 3rd August from the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force, he asks that the Manuals should be sent to the Afghan Legation in London. I have actually given instructions to send them to the Legation and I note in your letter to Lucas you ask that Hawkers should do likewise. This is a small point, but it would be as .well to make it quite clear to the Afghan Minister. There are thirteen Air Ministry Manuals and publications which we consider suitable, some of which are marked 'for official use only'. Two c#pies^o£feach are being sent as requested by the Commandant, 3. Further to my demi-official letter of the 9th instant on the question of V/apitis, the outstanding answers to paragraph 3 of the cypher telegram from His Majesty^ Minister at Kabul forwarded under cover of India Office letter 5142/37 dated the 6th instant, are now available. The price of aircraft will be £650 in their existing condition delivered at Karachi, the sale to be on pre-payment. The aircraft will be complete in all respects with engines and equipment, but not including such items as guns and bomb racks. 4. The question cf erecting and testing the aircraft at Karachi and subsequently flying them to Kabul or their despatch by other means from Karachi to Afghanistan is presumably a matter for the Government of India. \ 5. Iraq have now replied that the time required to pack up the Wapitis ready for shipment will be one month. We must, H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.of course, add to that the time before a suitable ship is available to take the packing cases and the time on passage to Karachi. 6. The question raised in your demi-official letter P.Z.5305/37 of yesterday's date regarding spares for the Wapiti aircraft is being investigated. It may be necessary to ask Iraq and a reply will be sent as soon as possible. * ' 7. I would add that an early decision on this matter of Wapitis is most desirable, partly because they are occupying space we badly need and partly, of course, because they will naturally deteriorate whilst lying in storage since they cannot be given the maintenance usually accorded to Royal Air Force aircraft in storage. d.

The Afghan Government made no secret of their intention to purchase a number of cheap aircraft on the Continent in addition to the eight Hinds which they have bought from Messrs.Hawkers. Last February we offered the Afghan Minister between 10 and 12 old Wapiti aircraft at the knockdown price of £500 each, in the hope that this might divert the Afghans altogether from Italy and Germany. We received no reply to this offer but a few days after it was made the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force in conversation with Sir E.Ellington and Mr.Collier referred scornfully to the Wapitis as J museum pieces. Consequently as the air authorities in Iraq (where the Wapitis are) wished to release the storage space which they were occupying/occupying, we told the Afghan Minister on 14th July that orders were being given for their disposal. 2. The Afghan Prime Minister raised the question of this offer of Wapitis with Major Macann and the Military Attache at Kabul on 4th August, saying that he had only just heard of it. It looks from what he said as if we have a good chance of doing a deal. Fortunately the air authorities in Iraq have not yet broken up the Wapitis and they are still available. 3. Possibly the Prime Minister’s interest in the Wapitis has been quickened by the situation in Katawaz, and I understand from the Air Ministry that if necessary some of them at least could be flow r n to Kabul very quickly. //• 8. 3.?(3 AIR MINISTRY. ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. W.C.2. 9th August 9 1937. I am enclosing a copy of a letter which we have just sent to the Foreign Office on the supply of maps and instruction hooks to the Afghan Government. With regard to India Office Memorandum 5142/37,dated 6th instant, on the subject of V/apiti aircraft, we sent a telegram to ^raq on Friday and in reply they state that the aircraft are still available and they are awaiting our disposal instructions. ' i'he replies to the questions asked in paragraph 3 of the cypher telegram fromare as follows:- (a) Wapitis are still available, but in f lraq, not England. (b) There are no Wapitis available in India at present but we expect to have some about the end of 1938 f when the India squadrons are re-equipped. (c) fnis information is not yet available, but our Finance branch are making investigations and I will let you know the result in due course. (d) The Wapitis are quite suitable for punitive bombing and, to a limited extent, for internal Air Mail services. The limiting factor is the bulk of the packages to be carried. (e) The service ceiling of the Wapiti with a normal load is 20,400 ft. The range, under H.A.F. Rumbold Esq., India Office, King Charles Street, S.W.l. /normalI normal cruising conditions is 323 miles, or 345 miles at the most economical cruising speed.

As regards your comment on the high price of British machines, the Afghan Government may be interested to know that the Air Ministry have available for sale up to ten or twelve Wapiti aircraft, which might be useful to the Afghan Air Force for training purposes. These machines could be sold to the Afghan Government for £500 each in full flying trim complete with engines, equipment and a small range of spares which is at present available. They are part-worn, but are in the same condition as Wapitis used by the Royal Air Force, and have a substantial life remaining; and they are of a type now in service in India.(3 SECRET. P.

Kawkers for quotation for 8 Hinds with a considerable amount of spares and ancillary equipment. It seems probable that these would bring up price to a figure greatly in excess of that previously stated for each aircraft. I hope to telegraph in a few days the figure Hawkers will quote, and how much is in respect of aircraft with essential equipment. 3. Afghan Minister called at Foreign Office on 7th December (see record of interview by mail of 10th December) and raised following two points:- (a) Muhammad Ihsan's present intention is to advise purchase of 8 Hinds, but owing to their cost Afghan Government could pay for 8 machines only in 6 equal annual instalments. Wes this out of the question? (b) Is Government of India's offer of training conditional on any undertaking to buy more than 8 machines 4. I suggest that we should now make Afghans an offer to finance purchases made through the Air Ministry up to a stated total price between now and 1st April 1938, to be repaid to Government of India in 6 equal annual instalments, Afghans being free to decide what material they buy with this credit. If you agree, please consider/&gt; J consider, after you receive my further telegram promised in paragraph 1, what this figure should be. I understand from . Air Ministry * that if a concrete proposition were made to Hawkers they would most probably agree to payment by Government of India being spread over, say, 3 years. difficult to make offer of training depend on the amount of their requirements of material which Afghan Government obtain from British sources, because latter itself depends so much on Government of India’s power to finance credits. Statement of Afghan Government’s intentions in regard to purchase of 8 Hinds now given by Ali Mihammad (see record of interview by mail) seems to go as far as we can expect in the circumstances. It is however proposed to inform Ali Muhammad that Air Ministry have available about a dozen secondhand Wapitis which could be sold for under £1,000 each, and if Afghans should be willing to accept this offer, it would seem to solve some of their difficulties and our s. G • As regards Ali Muhammad’s enquiry (b), it isP.Z.9114/36. Extract from Air Ministry Letter,to H.A.F.Rumbold Esq., Dated 22nd December,1936. 5, As regards the Wapitis, the Treasury are willing that these should be sold at £500 each in full flying trim complete with engines, equipment and a small range of spares if available when the Afghans make up their minds. These machines are part worn and for this reason no guarantee can be given. Actually, they will be in the same condition as used by the B.A.F. and will have a substantial life remaining. They are of the type still used in India and are definitely good value at this price. 6. It is probable that up to 10 or 12 could be made available forthwith.P.Z.8976/36. Extract from India Office Letter, to H.RussellEsq,, Air Ministry,Dated 18th December,1936. 4, As regards the Wapitis, we believe that the intentions of the Afghan Government are to buy a certain amount of equipment in the United Kingdom, provided they can afford Messrs.Hawkers' prices, and to look abroad for cheaper aircraft to meet their remaining requirements. If they are willing to take Wapitis it may be possible to prevent them purchasing many or indeed any cheap aircraft abroad. We therefore hope that you will be able to quote the lowest possible price for them. When the Afghan Minister next calls at the Foreign Office, it is proposed to tell him that Wapitis are available at low prices and to offer to give him a quotation. It is therefore urgent that His Majesty’s Government should be in a position to quote a definite figure to the Afghans.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022b_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2017</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00022b</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2017</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/57 ‘Afghanistan: Sale of WAPITI aircraft to Afghan Govt’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-15T23:08:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (62 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 64; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file documents negotiations surrounding a proposal – ultimately unsuccessful – by the British Government to sell second-hand Westland Wapiti aircraft to the Afghan Air Force.
