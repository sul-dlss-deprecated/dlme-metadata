(b) They are opposed to granting Shaikh request in regard to machine gtos and armoured cars both because of unfailing provocative effect on I ton Saud and because of uncertainty as to capacity of Shaikhdom to produce people competent to use them or even prevent their falling into eneny hands. In principle too they are averse from allowing machine guns and even armed cars to pass into hands ox Arab Rubers unless this is quite essential and could not agree to provision of tanks or of 'armoured cars' strictly so-called# You should in these circumstances reply on this point that His Majesty's Government have no reason to anticipate a situation in which possession of either machine guns or armoured cars would be necessary to enable Shaikh to secure his interests and that they are unable to give him any undertaking of the nature he describes.

My dear Sterndale Bennett, You will have seen the telegrams which have been passing about the Qatar oil negotiations. Fowle is now proceeding to Qatar with a view to clinching matters with the Sheikh, who has, we understand from Lefroy's letter of 3rd May of which a copy is enclosed, given the Company a vaguely-worded letter of acceptance of their proposals, coupled Y /ith intimation that his acceptance is subject to acceptance by His Majesty's Government of his requirements of them and that he requires a decision within 10 days from apparently 3rd May. 2. Y/e need not perhaps attach too much importance to the i Sheikh's time limit, but it will be desirable to arrange in the immediate future for the signature of the Qatar Government Agreement, which was for practical purposes agreed early last year as a result of discussions between the interested Departments and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and I enclose a copy of it in its latest form with a few minor amendments, which has now been sent to Lefroy under my letter of to-day of which a copy is also enclosed. Sterndale Bennett, Esq., C .M.G., M.C., Foreign Office.5) hay v:e a-oouiae that che Porei t n Oi'ficfe iiave no further observations to offer on it and that they will see no objection to signature if circuoi- stances justify this by a member of this Office, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, under the same procedure as was adopted in the case of the Koweit Government Agreement? 5. 1 ought to add that in agreement with the Company it was decided last year (compare Lefroy's letter to me of 10th October last and my reply of 18tli October, copies sent to Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department under our printed letter P.Z.65E7/34 of 20th October) that letters should be exchanged between the Political Resident and the Sheikh similar in effect to those exchanged v between the political Agent at Koweit and the Sheikh of Kov/eit on the 23rd May, 1934, (0,189 and 28th May, 1934,) (R.4/1519), the effect of which would be to cover the excision of the last paragraph of Artie le 14 and the whole of Article 21 of the draft Commercial Agreement dated 13th March, 1934, of which copies were sent to the Foreign Office, . Admiralty and Petroleum Department under our printed letter of 16th March, 1934, P.Z.1786/34. Fowle has now produced drafts for this object, copies of which are now enclosed.Some redrafting may 'be desirable, but substantially they appear to cover the ground and we propose, subject to further discussion with the Company, to approve the action suggested in paragraph 3 of his covering letter, of 25th April, 322-S. 4. I am sending a similar letter to Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department. We should be grateful for a very early reply. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) J.G-.

In confirmation of our telephone conversation this afternoon, we have just received from Mylies a telegram sent off today, stating that he has received a vaguely worded letter of acceptance of the concession terms with a definite refusal on the Shaikh 1 s part to sign pending complete agreement between the Shaikh and His Majesty's Government. The Shaikh offers ten days for a completion of such agreement and the signature of the concession, and states that thereafter he considers himself free to take such action as he thinks fit. Last night Abadan telegraphed that they had forwarded to Mylles advice received from the Resident, that Mylles should confirm in writing to the Shaikh that agreement had 'been reached with the Company, 'but that the Sheikh wished to delay signature until agreement had been reached between himself and His Majesty's Government. Mylles has asked Abadan to pass on to the Resident the gist of the Shaikh's letter received today. As regards the Agreement between the Company and His Majesty's Government, I understand that you propose to send us a fair copy with a view to its early completion* Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd.) L.

If then Shrikh were allowe^ to import as suggested in clause (a) of your telegram he could apparently bring in a consignment of some 4000 weapons. This would enable him to run flourishing arras trade in interior and possibly in Persia. 2. We realise that unaer article 3 of ,atar Treaty he is allowed an annual import of 500 weapons but strength of his fighting men coula hardly justify recurring iiiiport even on this scale. 3.

ARTICLE IV C •L«Rt Thia can be pointed out to the Shaikh as a measure of convenience| an advantage in that it gives the Shaikh only one responsible head to deal with* fRTICLB V &gt; Distinctly advantageous to the Shaikh since Coy# have got to pay due deference to his wishes* This does not bind the Jhaikh as he has so far made no regulations) but on the other hand it binds the Coy. to accept his regulations if and when he does make any. In brief this means that any sites (e*g« aerodromes| harbours) or me^ns of communication (e .g. wireless) which in the opinion of His Madesty^ Govt, are necess ary for the defence of the Shaikh shall not come under the control of the Coy. With regard to the second i&gt;art of this Clause i.e. 'harbours under exclusive control of the Coy. H . This goes no further than Clause VI of the Commercial Agreement and it will be to the interest of the Coy* to inprove the harbour for instance perhaps be able to find a deep water channel in| which will be to the advantage of the Shaikh. article VIII . Sec* 6 of C.A. gives Coy. the right to construct / ARTICLE VIII&amp;f -3- article x. •. -v-.VJ •' .-.i construct W /t ate. etc* which present Clause binds the Coy* not to operate this W/T etc* etc* In such a wqy as to inter fere with any W/T etc* constructed by the Shaikh or by H*M*6* for his defence* Refinery when constructed will be to the advantage of the Shaikh* Pre-emption# National emergency or war means one in which H«U*G* are the sole Judge* This makes no Hfference to the Shaikh as pre-emption is meant that the Govt* shall have th» right of buying the Oil from the Co^ * f who will of course continue to pay to the Shaikh what they are due to pay him* In Article 14 (b) of Commercial Agreement the Shaikh has the right to cancel the Commercial Agreement for certain breaches of that Agreement after arbitration (vide Art* 16)* Present Clause gives Shaikh a similar right for any breach of the Govt* Agreement* Draft Letter to Shaikh* 3 (a) It can be pointed out to Shaikh that since the terms of the Political Agreement are either favourable to him 9 or deal with matters in which he is not concerned y it is obviously to his advantage that the *01* Agreement should over-ride the Commercial* Further /-4- Purther II.K«G f are not a party to the Comraercial Agreement ana the only way they have of typing the Coy* to see that the Pol* Agreement should override the Comuer* cial Agreement. Should the Shaikh ask for exomplea of overriding we could take the cases of (a) transfer of Concession vide Art* XII of C«A« and Article 11 of Govt •Agreement (b) i ^ployment of ^ataris vide C«A* Art. XVII and G.A.Art* III. 3 (b) Briefly this means that if the Shaikh terminates the Concession owing to a breach by the Coy. of the Govt .Agreement (vide para XI of Govt..-&amp;reemfent above) he gets the same rights in regard to return of land etc. as if he had terminated it under the Commercial Agreement. (c) Under* Article VII of C.A. they can take any land| but under Article VIII of Govt. Agreement they cannot take ground required for aerodromes for Shaikh 1 b defence.

I visited Dohah on the S9th June 1935 and was received most hospitably by the Shaikh, who regretted that X was leaving at once, as he had arranged gaices and various kinds of hosplt- ality ashore for myself and for the officers of H .M.S Fowey. I told him that we would be back within a week and should be extremely honoured by his hospitality then. 3. With regard to the choice of a landing ground in Qatar and reconnaissance flights. The Shaikh raised no objection whatsoever and merely stated that he had given his written assurance on these matters which was quite enough. The arranging of the aerodrome required no political skill on my part, a fact that the Shaikh emphasised# 4. In reply to my brief speech presenting him with a Medal, the Shaikh made a most friendly reply of which I enclose a copy. 5. Despite the Shaikh 1 s friendly reception and the fact that there will be no difficulty with gy regard to the landing ground in Qatar I still think that it would be advisable for /me to(1) p THIS AGREEMENT dated the fifth day of June One thousand nine hundred and thirty five, is made BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY'S CK)VERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (hereinafter called 'His Majesty^ Govern^lent ,, ) of the one part and the ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY LIMITED (hereinafter called 'the Company' which expression shall where the context so admits be deemed to include its successors and/or assignees) of the other part.
