The Chairman explained that the meeting had been called to discuss the purchase of Iraqi dates of the 1945 crop. The Co-ordinated Purchasing Scheme had been proposed in 1942 in order to ensure supplies to Middle East territories and in 1943 the Ministry of Pood had entered into an agreement with lindrevv Weir &amp; Company to purchase the exportable surplus of all dades from the Basra Liwe. Later, owing to the demands of the urab Sheikdoms and of Saudi- .arabia, 25,000 tons of basket dates were purchased in the Euphrates area. nS soon as the latter 'puxch.ase had been negotiated the demand from these territories lapsed, and the Ministry of Pood was involved in a consequential loss. In 1944- the scheme was continued, and in addition to Basra dates 35,-Q00 tons of Euphrates dates were purchased. Had it not been for certain unexpected demands from liberated territories, a further loss would have been sustained. Present: 2. The Ministry would be unwilling to purchase basket dates X945 unless; (a) The Arab oheikdoms were willing to co-operate in the scheme and to : * take their stated requirements in full. (b) The full co-operation of the Middle East Supply Centre were forth coming. (c) Control of rail transport and (d) Adequate .shipping facilities v/ere available. (e) Purchases ooulxl be made at prices which would permit of acceptable selling prices to consuming territories. . • ” 3 . M r.

He pointed out that the dhow traffic to India had been reduced and great difficulty experienced in obtaining ocean shipping, undrew Vrer '&amp; Co. had a concession for a further two years for all dates, basket, and boxed, in the Basra Liwa at last year's price; but had no control over Euphrates dates. It was therefore necessary to decide, if the sale of Euphrates dates was left to a free market, whether it would affect the price of the dates sold by Andrew ,/Sir. Basra dates if bought by the Ministry of Pood from ^ndrew Weir, could be sold to Middle East territories at a slightly lower price than last year, when the cost of basket dates had to be increased tp cover the higher price jaid for Euphrates dates. If, however/ the price of barley fell, it was possible that date prices might also fall, especially as crop prospects were good* If the Ministry of Pood only contracted to buy boxed d ates from Andr ew Weir, the Company would probably charge higher prices in order to cover any possible losses on basket dates. 5. Mr. Day pointed out that the Company could cancel their concession with the Iraqi Government on the payment of £30,000, and it might be cheaper for the Ministry of Pood to pay Andrew Weir this amount than to have to pay more for boxed dates. 6 . Mr. Hsurdain explained that the Middle East Supply Centre had entered into the scheme somewhat unwillingly and would not want to continue it. He did not think the Centre could do anything more co induce the territories to take up their stated requirements in full or to make firm contracts v/ith the Ministry of Pood for dates. It would also be difficult to organise any better transport as the Baghdad Aleppo railway would not be controlled much longer by the military authorities, who would be withdrawing rolling stock. The carrying capacity of the railv/ay would therefore be likely to decrease rather than increase. The dhow traffic was not controlled by the Ministry of War Transport, and the provision of ocean tonnage presented great difficulties. The Co-ordinated Scheme could not be operated in the Middle East unless dates bought by the Ministry of Food were likely to be cheaper than those bought on the free market, a condition which would only obtain in a bad season. Since there was likely to be a good crop it was probable that the dates sold by Weir to the Ministry of Pood would be more expensive than those purchased on the free market. 7. Mr. Nind believed that the Arab Sheikdoms would not be anxious to enter into a co-ordinated scheme. G. Mr. Parsons thought that the best solution would be for the Ministry of Pood's purchases in 1945 to be limited to boxed dates, of wiich he was:of opinion that 60,000 tons could be allocated by the C.P.E. 9. Mr. Wilson stated that the Treasury would prefer that the Ministry should not -purchase basket dates from either the Basra or Euphrates area, and he felt that future purchases should only be made against firm orders. 10. Mr. Jourdain asked how Andrew Weir would dispose of basket dates from the Basra area if they were not bought by the Ministry of Pood and whether there would be political repercussions with the Iraqi Government if the Ministry of Pood only purchased boxed dates. 11. The Chairman in 'summing up thoug;ht it was quite evident from the discussion that the Meeting was not in favour of a continuation of centralised buying of basket dates for the coming season and it was agreed that a record of the discussion be sent to the Foreign Office v/ith an intimation that unless the Secretary of State had strong reasons to urge to the contrary, the Minister of Pood would buy only boxed dates this year, and would make provision for the supply of basket dates only against firms orders.3 ” r f wu - ■*.' ■w \V &gt; ,1 . i^'H /xfl, .

Addressed Bushire repeated to Government of India, External Affairs Department. Your telegram No.1369 of 11th June. 1944 Crop Dates. I have discussed your views with Ministry of Food who state that they have now concluded contract through Andrew Weir for purchase of all Iraqi dates available by 31st December, and have been guaranteed 100,000 tons; They will be able to sell basket dates FOB Basrah at 20/- per owt. in coming season. They are able to guarantee now 12,000 tons for Sheikdoms as mentioned in my telegram No.10840, and they would guarantee delivery of these before end December. They have little doubt that provided competitive purchasing is eliminated they will be 'able to offer further 5,000 tons as season develops. 2. In view of foregoing Ministry trust you will feel able to go beyond promise made in your paragraph 3 and approach Sheikdoms to refrain from independent purchasing before 31st December. Ministry desire to know division of 12,000 tons between three Sheikdoms, and on allocation being agreed would expect guarantees that quantities allocated would be taken up. , it has been arranged with Weir that dates should be ready for shipment at Basrah when dhow traffic commences in sufficient quantities at price mentioned to fill dhows. It is felt that this would alleviate Sheikdoms anxieties as to supplies and lessen incentive to independent purchasing. 4 , I shall be glad to know at early date your reply to paragraph 2 .

France and cyself. ^Ir» y arsons started by giving us a resume of the present position of negotiations. No contract with /indrew Weir had yet been si t ^Ted but they had agreed to procure Basra basket dates at the same price ius last year. The Ruphmtcs iirov/ers were holding out for a considerably liigjier price. The eliraimtion of lOtphrates supplies meant tliat Andrew \/cir would bo in a position to ^uarahtefcyTO,000 tons against tiw i)revious 100,000. Of tiiis 35,000 would be boxed dates so tliat tlie allot?at ion of basket dates would have to bo drastically reduced. Tl*y pro^/oaed however that provided the .Steikhdotos coma into the sciieiae to maintain their allocation at 12,000 tons. All other allocations would be cut including India's to 10,000. The contract would ensure delivery of 70,000 tons by the end of leoeiaber and the price at wliioh tlie Ministry would be able to deliver dates f.o.b. Basra would be 19 shillings. This reduction over tlio figure previously stated had been made possible by the acceptance of a considerably smaller oomoission by Andrew .«eir. Jliere was a long discussion as to vriiethajLit was worth while to continue v/ith the sciieiae, but finally it was felt that it would be unsafe to leave prices to find their own level. In view of what had happened last year there would almost certainly be a scramble and prices would go sky high. Provided tliat this was avoided at the beginning of tlie season and provided that dates wore available when the dhows first started to call at Basra, it was thought there was everyoljance of scouring eventually more than the quantity mentioned. There was also the chance, as hajjpened last year, tiiat at the end of. the season Euphrates growers would oorae in. © » 4 . It was decided that the present position sliould be put both to the M. iS.O. and to the political Resident and that they should be asked for their views on the basis of the reduced allocations and the j^rloe stated above, as the contract had not yet been signed it was obvious that this price should be kept strictly confidential. Jourdain who was recently but in the Middle ISast and discussed the date position at Bagdad thought tiiat the main point was to secure supplies for the dhows to carry away when they first visited Ikvsra after the Monsoon. This would relieve anxiety and minimise the chances of attempts at smuggling. The reduced price of 19 shillings would have a salutory effect in this direction. It had been arranged with Weir in the event of the contract being signed to start buying as soon as the season opened so tiiat those supplies would be in readiness. , « . I I agreed to send a telegram on those lines to the Political Resident. I had in mind all tlirough the discussion the remark which Hr. reel made that he was not altogether happy about the Sheikhdoms standing out of the scheme. I place below the draft of such a telegram and should be glad to know whether you concur with it before I send it to the . Ministry of cod for their concurrence. I have kept a copy on my file so that if necessary a telephone message to tl» effect that you concur will be sufficient. AINWARD TELEGRAM Allotted to E &amp; Q oDepartment, CYPHER TELEGRAM (CAT.?.?

After their experiences of last season Aral Sheikhdoms are very (? reluctant) to have any further dealing with Andrew Weir •and would prefer to purchase their requirements through their own agency* 2.

Forpign Office Foreign Office Ministry of War Transport Ministry of War Transport Treasury Treasury India Office Ministry of Food Ministry of Food Ministry -of Food I'. Ir Scouler stated that he had ceiled the nice ting to discuss the procedure for purchasing the 19MA crops of Iraqi dates. A memorandum had been circulated putting forward certain proposals and summarising the difficulties encountered in the purchase and distribution of dates this year. There had been much criticism of the scheme. The Ministry however, felt that it was desirable to continue the scheme in 1944 and they were prepared to undertake it, but to do so the co-operation of the M.E.S.C. and the consuming countries must be ensured. The fact that Middle East territories were clamouring for dates had caused the Ministry of Food to purchase 25,000 tons of Euphrates dates. Now the territories were reluctant to take the dates and it looked as if the Ministry might be left with about 20,000 tons of dates. India could absorb more dates but transport difficulties were impeding their import. It looked as if Andrew Weir would continue to hold the concession but a contra.ct would only be made this year with Weir for one year. It was hoped that the Iraqi G-overnment would assist in various ways towards the smoother working of the scheme. An early decision was required as the season was getting on. ;j ilr Chaplin stated that if the contract was made v/ith Weir’s a minimum quantity should be fixed, with a penalty clause for default. Mr Nind stated that the co-operation of the Political Resident could not. be obtained without a guarantee that the dates would be obtained. It seemed also, that the territories would need to guarantee that they would take all their requirements. He would like to encourage the Sheikhdoms by indicating that they would have a larger quantity than promised to them last year. Mr Scoulcr stated that he would ra.ther at the start contract for a lower quantity which he would be sure of obtaining with an option of getting: mote later. He suggested a. minimum figure of 60,000 basket dates and 40,000 cased dates. Llr Jourdadn stated that he had discussed this question with M.E.S.C. and the British Embassy in Bagdad. It seemed that certain charges were necessary if the scheme were to be successful. He emphasised tha.t closer supervision of Weir wa-s needed, but greater freedom of action for Murchison. An organisation v/as needed to control the allocations after the dates had been delivered ready for shipment. Weir should take instructions from this organisation. The various territories in the Middle East should, rJ.so, be visited to get firm orders as soon as the prices and quantities could be assessed. Price exerted a material influence upon the level of demand.- id though the M.E.S.C. v/as prepared to help in this work he felt tha.t a technical expert from the Ministry of Food should edso be sent to Ire„q. Mr Jourdain also stated that the Middle East Supply Centre Would support the scheme providing this extra supervision were carried out. . /M.E.S.C.■■I M.E.S.C. v/cre of the opinion that last year difficulties had arisen because the scheme had started late. Hr Murchison, V/eir’s manager in Iraq, had also authorised buyers to collect their dates direct from growers indicated by him, and they had to pay a charge to T/eir's end obtained no services in return.. The margin between Weir's purchase price from the growers and the original f.o;b. price of the dates was too great, since it was possible to buy dates from the growers at a higher price then they received from Y/eir end still resell them at less then the f,o,b. : price fixed under the schem This encouraged smuggling. Y/hen the Ministry of Pood's price was reduced 'Yto 21/- the smuggling-almost ceased. It was hoped that the margin could be reduced this year also. Another difficulty had been that the consuming countries had not placed firm orders for dates, so that they did not take up the allocations made to them. Hr Seouler stated that he hoped that the Ministry would be able to purchase at 40 dinars this year. With a lower margin to Y/eir it was hoped to get the f.o.b. price below 21/-. It depended, however, what quantity ,of Euphrates dates was obtained. The cost of placing these dates F.O.R or P.O.B. was higher than for Basra dates. It might be, however, that such increase would have to be agreed over 40 dinars per kara. Mr Yilson stated the Treasury agreed that it'was desirable to continue the scheme for 1 944. Mr Jourdain pointed out that if the Euphrates dates could be .obtained early in the season they could be sent to Palestine and Syria which would reduce their cost. ^ It was the lateness in obtaining these dates which led to difficulty in dosposing of them in Syria and Palestine this year. Mr Nind mentioned that criticisms had been received from the Sheikhdoms that dates which would normally have come to them had been sent to the United Kingdom. Hr Seouler stated that this was not so and that up to 1939 about 60,000 tons of cased dates were exported annually as compared with 40,000 tons in 1944. Proportionately more dates were packed in baskets this year. Further, exports of dates to the Dominions and U. S.A. had been entirely eliminated. It was finally agreed that (a) negotiations should be started with Andrew Weir For a guaranteed quantity at a price if possible not higher than that paid for the 1943 crop, but that Y/eir 1 s charges should be reduced. (b) that the Ministry of Pood should endeavour to send a representative to Iraq at the earliest opportunity. (c) that the decisions reached should be communicated to M.E.S.C. and , the Politicsd Resident with a request for co-operation in the scheme.■ ■■■■Hi :VVT, T SFuM Nc» 2258 To : M.V/.T* London Prom : ]\1ESC *h&gt; f - o-rtf) • Dated: ^th April 1944, pu ; hrvi* Addressed to M/T London No, 2258 Saving, rptd, Baghdad No, 279 Saving, IRAQI DATES V ' • * .. 194 ^ l e K enerall y agreed that the working of the Date Control Scheme in 1.43 was not wholly successful and it is desirable that we should now try to utilise the lessons learned before entering into the 1944 Control Scheme, rjfic; 2 *, ^ he f^ors which made Murchison’s task unnecessarily difficult ' t he -ate date at which he entered the Basra market.

Until questions of price etc., have been ' L saGh _ an approach^may be unprofitable as the Territories are somewhat sore ov^r the failure to obtain early delivery of dates this last season. However, is approach to the Territories must be made as soon as possible and we should endeavour to have at least preliminary quotas allocated by end July. Bxp^iience has shown tha.t if Andrew Weir’s selling price is too high compared with the buying price from the cultivator, it will simply l^ad to smuggling as smugglers will be able to deliver the dates in the neighbouring territories at a price considerably below that offered by Andrew Weir. Great care should therefore be•taken to limit profits to a minimum. 5, we understand that the Sheikh, of Koweit has his gardens near Pao at the mouth of the 3hatt-el-Arab and therefore it would seem uneconomic to ship these a es up to Basra and for Koweit to have to draw dates from Basra for the town of Koweit. We therefore suggest that an arrangement be come to with the Sheikh of oweit that he shall pay his fair taxes to the Iraq Government but that his dates should be free to^move* direct over into the town of Koweit. It will have to be agreed what quantity of dates arc thus involved and this would be deducted from the Koweit quota, v /lu x N0t 0nly mUst P° lic M as regards Basra dates be settled by August 15th, but that regarding Euphrates dates should also be settled at the same time. It is possible that the holders of Euphrates dates may find that considerable quantities of their stocks will go bad on their hands this year owing to the long delay in iquidating these stocks. They may therefore be more ready to come into a pool scheme at the_commencement of the year, and every effort should be made to have Euphrates basic prices fixed not later than August 15th. 7 * . 0ncQ G 11 have been agreed with Territories, it must be made a two-sided bargain. Not only must Ministry of Food undertake to deliver these dates at a reasonable time to the Territories, but the Territories must guarantee to take up their quotas provided these quotas are offered at a treasonable time and at the agreed price. Otherwise all planning becomes impossible, 1 • 3. ydiile Murray and Jourdain wore in Bagdad a representative.of Andrew Weir stated^in open meeting that Andrew Weir would hold MESC responsible for any financial losses which might be incurred owing to non-allocation of the 25,©rvo tons which Andrew weir ore stated to have bought lately from the Euphrates growers in Bagdad. This was of course refuted immediately as being entirely baseless, any ' agreement regarding purchases etc., of the dates being between Ministry'of Food an&lt; anc c i r « Eartlier we have understood that Andrew Weir were specifically ins rue ed nly 1,0 buy dates in Bagdad within the limitations of transport * available. However, not only in this instance but vis-a-vis the Territories awiq, A&lt;Coritinur.tion pf Telegrrjn No, 2258 Saving to MuT London. to non-dclivory of quotas in the early part of the season and -v.'ing to the exaggerated prices which have been charged, MESC have had to bear a certain amount of opprobrium although MESC have not been in -a position to alleviate of these difficulties. e therefore, consider that it is essential to appoint some suitable local representative who can supervise the distribution of dates to the various consumers and issue relative instructions to Yfeirs within the genera.l quotas fixed by the Ministry N f Pood* Such a. representative would also keep in touch with the territories to see that they take up their allocations when asked and open the necessary credits. If desired by the Ministry.of Food, MESC would be prepared to undertake these duties provided the scope of their functions and authority was clearly defined. 1C, ,,e also feel most strongly tha/b a Representative of the Ministry of Pood should come out to the Middle East as soon as possible (if possible arriving in Cairo for preliminary discussions not later than the middle of May) afterwards proceeding to Basra to settle all matters of detail at that end, and should then visit the IRPG- and various :ther Territories to agree with them preliminary quotas and supplementary quotas (should the available stocks allow of! these) and to explain to them the proposed working of the 1944 Pool Scheme, in order to convince them that this pool scheme will have a genuine advantage over a return to the free market, 11, Please comment urgently.

From To Secretary of State The political iiesident in the Persian Gulf repeated to Government of India, External Affairs Department. Despatched 10th Hay 1914, 07.30 hours. 10840. n.CcOHTAIJT. Addressed Bushire repeated Government of India. It is proposed that Ministry of Food should again act as Controlling purchaser of Iraqi Dates during coming season. Ministry had hoped to make a Government to Government contract with Iraqi Government but latter have resisted this and Ministry must again operate through Andrew Weir. Ministry realise fully that scheme as worked last season fell short of expectations but are confident that with experience gained main object of ensuring supplies at reasonable price will be attained in coming year provided they receive co-operation of authorities in importing territories, 2. Main defects in last season’s scheme in addition to its late inauguration were (l). owing to inflated estimate of incidental costs sale price was fixed at a figure which allowed a margin over garden price large enough to encourage smuggling. (2) Weir 1 s failure to purchase dates Limedlately scheme started and their practice of sending merchants to growers for supplies instead of arranging these themselves retarded procurement and caused misconception and resentment regarding Ministry’s profits. Regarding (1) Ministry understand that snuggling ceased when price was reduced to 21 shillings. For coning season it is hoped with more accurate costing and proposed reduction in Weir’s commission to fix sale price below price of 21 shillings provided garden price does not exceed that paid last season. This depends on negotiations now proceeding in Bagdad. Regarding (2) Weir’s will be instructed at / earliest possible moment to commence active purchasing in advance of any commitments with buyers and will be expressly forbidden tc send merchants to secure their own dates from gardens. It is thus hoped that supplies will be available in Basra to take full opportunity of earliest dhow traffic to Sheikhdoms. In addition Ministry propose to send their own representative to Basra to ensure that their instructions will be correctly implemented and to report any difficulties as s-on as they may arise. These measures should I think meet substantially your criticisms of working of last year’s scheme. 3» There is reason to hope that Iraqi Government will guarantee minimum repeat minimum delivery of 100,000 tons of which not more than 40,000 will be packed in cases for U#K., Services and Russia. Amount packed in cases represents substantial reduction on pre-war tonnage. Of remaining 60,000 basket dates Ministry propose provisional allotment of not less than 12,000 tons to Sheikhdoms. To date their actual deliveries this season are recorded as 5*272 tons. If as Ministry hope they in fact secure more than guaranteed minimum Sheikhdoms would get further allocation. Ministry will require some assurance that allotments will be taken up. Some Central lurchasing Scheme is I think necessary to keep prices down to reasonable level and it seems unlikely that all the Sheikhdoms coul 1 secure their requirements so satisfactorily outside scheae. I should be glad t: have at.y suggestions you wish to make but hope you will feel able to agree to full cooperation of Sheikhdoms in scheme. If you agree generally presume assurance referred to at end of paragraph 3 may be given? 5. • Ministry are anxious for early reply.F ■1Z\ Ko» 3U*a » g)OTp^TTlAl &gt; fKSTiiTJfiiCQf f Biiihir^ tti* 4rth A^TlX 1944. \ i: Lf&gt;^ - ^*“ I- V- ^V. ..^r f ^ ' ^ k4«&lt; iWt. t'**?* I ( . f ft *, i ill you plouut’ rofe r to you r t ole^ ri^ ko« 2603 of th« 8 th M&lt;»ioh 1944 iu« to on the pool liar* ' reading 4otfsi wvl o*j*% 1»* I 3^d not don« this before, liinoe ih« (Poyoxnuout of IntUn th^balv«o to the roly of *y*ots*'iov*s wid iinot the o^riate faote md deoisi cxi% were All on record with the » # 2 # 3,C. who would have ^ent then to *n&amp;lmni lon^ before T could have done eo # Tou will have einue have r«c*iv&lt;sd s&amp; t olei&lt;rtMn 7Qfl of the 19th March «ad »y_telegraoi._iia ^ 713 of ^-the^acth Huroh whicL give the poeition a* it jjtani&amp;* you however be interested in eome lMrih«r Acootmt of zy travelft. \ 2 # in the f ir&amp;t i&gt;laae 9 owing to the lox^ range ealvoee tt&gt;at I h«d fired Gar?.i(sr in the year X found everyone very penitent am helpful and all of thera blening each other for the difficult!ea in which we had been Involvedi undrew Weir blamed the Hinietiy of ?bod, the 0*K.CJ.a. blamed the * c* 9 th e &amp;• f$#*i #0» blar ed the Food Kin!etry 9 in foot the only people who have been Mnauooooaful in lifting any of the blame are un(*» 3 e«ti enable' the K ini a try of Food who have been shown to be not merely fcscla but knaves* Row far .jadrew «Ht •. oat* the feeataetic profit they levy for the Minlatry of Food J can* ot say ee rrurchiaon vibuld not dleoloee thie f and he gave me to urderotard th£^t their ooBiaiefclon was actually ernall f but it *&amp; oleuz* from other eourcee that their profit® art very large and oertainiy tite privileged position of undrew weir mm greatly resented by other British flrtoe in that area* The bulk of undrew Weir *» profits must gs in Iftoees Irofite Tax to. the treasury 9 and it is protably thie that led Murohieon to reconsEend to his prinoipali that tne Xo&amp;* involved by eellit^ cased dates at the price of taskst dates should be borne by Andrew ueir themselves* d» Tou will have seen that the Food Ministry did not agree to tho proposals lhat we Should be supplied with Hallawl dates at the same price as ftsyer dates and that they only agreed to the price reduction for the future# In other worae their policy is to refcraj t but not to refund or perhaps I could mors accurately liken then, unto an aria hie house* brsaker ms o while admitting fci s fault refuses to restort any of hie loot# The idiole effect upon Arab opinion has of course been deplorable* WMWMrir .'^WMkk■ 2 tfr Ofi) 4# You will refamnbar that in my tel egram Ko#25 3&lt;&gt; of 3Cth December 1943 X allUded t&lt;Tthe fact that H#lf^oThad collected 90f00C tons ssainly of Hallawi dateo by October# I understand this remark g&gt;t uoder the akin of the tfinisUy of Food* which Is exactly vfc&amp;t it was intended to do# While of ocurse it must be adaitted that there is &amp; difference between Hallawl dates and Bayer dates* all those whom x met in the trade agreed that heavy purchases in one line would inevitably affect prices and hoarding in another# I did not air &lt;luf carte, K.o*j*h;. f 0 * 8 . 1 *, i*a.s..

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, repeated to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. no truth in statement reported by you, that profit on sale of dates was intended as reimbursement for subsidy on cereals. My telegram No.2982 showed that Ministry of Pood had no desire to profit by date scheme and that sale price of 25 shillings per cwt. was calculated on estimated cost with only reasonable margin for contingencies. The price was reduced to 21 shillings as soon as it became evident that costs had been estimated too high and in this revised figure the Ministry reduced its cover for contingencies to 4d. only per cwt. Ministry are indeed now apprehensive lest some purchases will remain on their hands and that transactions over whole season may show substantial loss. 2. Figures now given by you show overall cost of 18s. 6d. per cwt. so that profit even when sale price was 25 shillings was appreciably less than 44 por cent, stated in your telegram* To your figures must be added Weir’s commission of 2s. 2d. per cwt. 3« Sole purpose of Ministry of Pood scheme is to secure equitable distribution at lowest prices possible and to this end Ministiy is subjecting all costs between garden and f.o.b. to closest scrutiny. In JI light of experience Weirs remuneration is considered excessive and if ( I they are used next season Ministry will press for substantial reduction. 4. I trust you will be able to make Ministry's objective clear throughout sheikhdoms. Your telegrams Nos.715 and 716 of 20th March.

Although present impasse would he avoided if your proposal contained in para.D.is put into effect it is thought that this policy would have serious repercussions later on. 2.

The general sense of the meeting was that the purchase should again be made, but that this tine the contract should be a government to government one, negotiated by our Baghdad Embassy, (on the lines of the barley contract for last season;, and that the Ministry of Pood should appoint some agent (probably Andrew Weir) to implement the contract. The main advantages in this course would be (1) that under such a contract the growers would have to produce a given quantity of dates and (2) the Ministry would have a freer hand in regard to price and incidental expenses. We made it clear that in view of this year's troubles we should have to consult the Political Resident in the Gulf before agreeing to any such scheme. We should like accordingly to let him 1-now by an early date what the Ministry of Pood were telegraphing to Baghdad so as to keep him posted as to what was in the wind. We should then be able to ask him whether he would agree to co-operate in such a scheme. kfaTV ?&lt; JuHiy*** ^ ji £ A* SfckLh^, ' T r ^ ^ ^ ^ - J^k ukM.

In principal we agree that control over exportable surplus of Iraq dates should be continued but we consider it necessary to stress following points: (a) (b) 2 . Only real v/ay for Iraqi Government to guarantee a minimum for export would be for them to extend their control and institute a date collection scheme by which every cultivator would have to surrender that proportion of his crop surplus sufficient to provide target quantity to a centralised control which might be Andrew Weir. Should Andrew Weir be nominated as buyers it is essential that they should (l) enter market at very beginning of season (2) take all dates offering into stock and not delegate to merchants from various territories actually buying from cultivators. At present confidence in scheme has been badly shaken in Middle East Territories particularly the Persian G u qf Sheikdoms and Palestine, If we are to obtain full co-operation of territories to prevent smuggling dates from next crop, concrete action must be taken in-the near future to complete deliveries of minimum quotas allocated to territories for present season. ll /xtA- Ijl 0.

His Highness 1 letter is in ny opinion clear and is a fair statement of the case. You are yourself fully aware of the events which led up to the agreement of the Persian Gulf states to co-o erate with His Majesty* s Lrovernment in their Dates Distribution Scheme^ and you are also aware how disastrous that co-operation has been jfovthe states. The immediate necessity is not to examine the causes of the failure of the Dates Distribution Scheme hut to ensure that dates are made available immediately in order to prevent a serious shortage and to restore the Ruler*s confidence in the Middle hast supply Centre. I suggest therefore that His Highness* letter should be brought to the notice of the Government of India and the authoricies concerned with the provision of supplies for the Persian sulf state*. ' • v/ . } - f lCopy of letter dated thC“lI£K January?. 1944, from His Highness Shaikh Sir Sulraan, rulec of Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, 4 ' « * v &gt; : 's i I would like to draw your attention td the question of our obtaining dates from Iraq tor consumption in Bahrain. In Bahrain the inhabitants grow a Small' quantity of dates representing less than one third of tne amount consumed in Bahrain every year and of these dates a great proportion were used in the past for feeding animals not for rood for the people. In tne past we obtained our supplies of dates irom Saudi Arabia and some from Iraq, the former country has no w forbid ded the export of date s. Dates are the essential Food or tne poor man but they are eaten also by people of ail glasses. For the thousands of men who go out to sea during the diving season dates are absolutely necessary, without dates the divers could not work. The diving industry in Bahrain employes more men than any other work, the majority of our people and their families depend upon diving for their liveli hood. Last year we bought dates in Iraq through our agent Mshamed Tfetunayan al uhanim. we obtained enougn dates at a reasonable p rice for the needs of our peopTe* and”~we supplied ITbedivers with dates at the price whicn we paid for them. This year we wished to buy dates from Iraq in the same way to supply the needs of our people but w r e were told that w r e should not act independently but that we must buy them through the firm of Andrew Weir. We were assured that our needs would be fulfilled, that we should have first priority in the distribu tion ol the dates which were controlled by the authorities in Iraq and w 7 e were told that arrangements had been made by which the price of dates would be kept within reasonable limits. We were asked not to buy dates direct from Iraq and not even to make independent inquiries about the prices 'of dates in Iraq. These requests we complied with. What has been the result of all these arrangements ? Less than one tenth of the dates which we ordered have arrived in Bahrain. y.e are informed that the price of dates is 1.50 ,er Kara, freight £.10 and that in addition to this w r e must pay to the firm of Andrew Wiir £.2b per Kara. It is said, but we are unwilling to believe this, that the British government is taking the whicn is charged on each Kara ol dates. This means that the dates, if they ever arrive in Bahrain, will cost more than twice tne price which we paid last year. Only wealthy people will be able to buy these dates and as we have stated before dates are necessary for the li divers and the poor. “»Te have no means of representing our grievances except through you therefore we request you zo make known our eonplaint to tnose in autnority. we ask that we should receive those things which we were told had been arranged for us, sufficient . dates for our urgent needs at a reasonable price, if there are no dates in Bahrain there will be no diving and if there f is no diving there will be very serious trouble in our country | and the fault will not be ours.

The Bahrain G-ovenment' s agent in Basrah has reported that the price of dates is rising in the Basrah area and that even Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company are encountering difficulty- in making purchases. It must be emphasised that Messrs. Andrew Weir and Company are making these purchases on their own account, according to information available here, and not to supply the Persian Gulf quota. Information received from various sources makes the outlook unsatisfactory for it is stated that at the end of this month the ban on the export of dates by rail from Khoramshahr wilj be raised and that the present average monthly freight of 500 tons will be increased to two to three thousand tons a month. This will naturally cause an immediate rise in the price of dates in Persia with a corresponding rise in the price of the Basrah dates.' J y &gt; {iiJt L*trn Messrs • Parsons and Day and Miss Hobley of the Ministry of Pood ^ called on 2?th January to give us information about the Ministry of Pood's scheme for purchasing Iraqi dates relative to telegram No*98 11th January from Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to paragraph 4(b) of our telegram No.1127 of 14th January. Mr. Harrison, External Department, was also present. They stated in regard to the P.R. *s request that 6,500 tons of cased dates should be made available to the Persian Gulf St^^es at the same price as Sayer dates r that the price of the cased^was about 40s. as against 25s. for the Sayer dates. In consequence, the Treasury would not agree to the proposal as made. They were, however, willing to allow the Ministry of Pood to expend their contingency reserve (amounting to 1s, ?d. per cwt.) on bringing down the price. The object of the reserve had been to insure them against inability to sell a portion of their purchases,but in present circumstances it did not look as if they would have to fall back on it. The Ministry of Pood had discussed this proposal to lower the price with Andrew Weir d the latter thought that (1) any drop in price would only cause oducers to hold of &amp; and (2) such discrimination in favour of the eikhdbiM wourd cause a tremendous amount of ill feeling among their her customers in the Middle East. The difference between their purchasing price of 14s. 6d. and their selling price of 25s. is made up as follows Packing and delivery Packers' remuneration Baskets Charge for placing on rail Weir's commission Contingency reserve 2s. 6d. 8d. 3s. 4d. 3d. 2s. 2d. 1s. ?d. 10s. 6d. formulated but the contract with Andrew Weir stipulated/' % stipulated for actual costings 'which would only he determined at the end of the season. As advised at present the Ministry of Stood thought that there would be a very considerable saving under these headings. They had no desire to make a profit out of the scheme and thought that probably they would repay any surplus from this season by means of a reduction in price next. It was felt to be very necessary that these figures should be available at the coming meeting in Cairo between the P.R. and the M.E.S.C. As there was no time now to be certain of getting them to P.R. before his departure for Cairo it was felt that it would be . preferable for the Ministry of Stood to telegraph than to Dr. Keith Murray. It was also decided that they should include in the telegram a statement to the effect that the Treasury would not, without very strong reasons being adduced, agree to the proposal made in the P.R. *s telegram No.98. It was thought, however, that there was a good deal to be said for Andrew Weir’s reaction to the suggestion that a lower price should be offered and it would be preferable at this stage not to mention anything on this subject. A further reason for not doing so was that a telegram had been received from M.E.S.C. (no copy of this was produced) to the effect that the Sheikh of Koweit had transported the dates from his own garden to his State and that in | consequence Koweit's needs had been satisfied. The Ministry of Pood were also of opinion that there was a reasonable chance that they would, within the next two months, obtain sufficient dates to satisfy the needs of the other Sheikhdoms who would, in any case, get priority of shipment for the present. !

Government of India, Cairo for M.E.S.C. and Baghdad. 14th January, 1944* 22.50 hours. 1127. IMPORT AMR Your telegram 2538 December 30th about dates has been discussed with Ministry of Pood, Ministry of War Transport and Murray of M.E.S.C. 2. It was agreed that the present position is far from satisfactory. Ministry of Pood contract was with Weir to buy up to 90,000 tons of Iraqi dates and supply to Sheikhdoms and other consuming countries quantities as allocated at prices mentioned in my telegram No.19444 of 27th August but no obligation was laid on Weir* s to produce dates if unobtainable at this price. In the result growers have hoarded stocks in hope of forcing higher price and full contract quantity has not yet been realised. Incidentally Weirs report that dates grown in garden belonging to Sheikh of Koweit are being withheld. Total deliveries to all markets from 1943 crop up till December 31st were 22,795 tons boxed dates of high quality and 17215 tons basket dates of which 3250 tons went to Sheikhdoms. At present Weir holds only 1000 tons of lower quality dates plus 4000 tons of higher quality. It is hoped that growers will have to yield soon, at any rate by end of March, but meam/hile it is agreed that failure to keep Sheikhdoms supplied is most unfortunate. It is recognised that, for whatever reasons, Sheikhdoms have in fact so far received less than their fair share of dates available and Ministry of Pood are therefore sending instructions to Weir to give priority of shipments of basket dates to Sheikhdoms over all other destinations until they have received at- least ~(% of their allocation. M.E.S.C. 191 Saving Misc. suggests that partial cause of small shipments is failure of merchants to produce dhows and insistence on particular variety of date. If this is so, I hope that you will do what is possible to remedy these difficulties. 3» Y&lt;ith regard however to paragraph 11 of your telegram I must emphasize extreme danger of merchants making independent approaches which will only encourage growers to hold out for higher prices. Merchants will in any case be unable to obtain dates at prices aimed at by Ministry of Pood and would presumably find it difficult to avoid Iraqi export control which I understand limits exports to Ministry of Pood purchases. 4» Further specific points emerged from meeting (a) Ministry of Pood after consulting Weirs here are emphatic that prices charged have been those mentioned in my telegram 19444 of August 27th and no cmre. These prices include charges mentioned in my telegram 22462 which were there incorrectly stated to be extras. (b) Weirs are not charging 6 C^ commission. Ministry of Pood state that difference between Weirs purchasing and selling price comprises legitimate expenses covering cost of packing and delivery to port. We are going further into this with Ministry and will telegraph later. Complaints mentioned in your paragraph 7 probably arose from misunderstanding of /their■naHman their original purchasing arrangement whereby part price was paid to them and part to grower who undertook delivery. Circular mentioned in your paragraph 8 is presumably to be accounted for by institution of new arrangement whereby payment of whole price was made by Weir who undertook to place goods F.O.B. or F.O.R. Basra. (c) M.E.S.C. have alleged that export figures of Basra dates to Sheikhdoms have in previous years been insignificant. Figures in annual trade reports certainly seem to indicate that in 1939/40 Koweit drew main supplies from Persia and Bahrein drew more from Arabia than Iraq. We should be glad to know whether these sources are now not available and whether Sheikhdoms are entirely dependent for supplies on scheme which of course applies to Iraqi dates only. (d) Your para. 3 U.K.C.C. have no interest in date business beyond handling Ministry of Food date allocation to Russia. 5.

We should be glad to have your oomaenta on it. ’There is one point -ihloh me not quite cleared up at the meeting vis. how the difference between Weir’s purchasing price and their selling price is accounted for. In the case of the cheapest quality, it ms said that the purchase price was I.D. U0 per kara (the equivalent of 14«.6£d. owt.) while the eel ling price is 25s.Od. per ewt. The allegation made by the Political r:oeldent that Ifeir’s are charging 60 f» ooiamisaion is presumably based on this differenoe and although we deny this in paragraph 4(b) of our draft, we think it necessary to add some thing by way of explanation as to how the difference between the two prices is accounted for. ’'tould you kindly supply this in some detail. fh© telegram mentioned in paragraph 5 of the draft is one mainly on a different subject but it itentions a visit from a representative of SUE. ).0., presumably 'toner, who had gone on to Bahrein and 'hajah and who ms returning to Burfiir© for further consultation with the Political Resident.

Section ( 3 ) (ext. 2697)Sxmmary of Dates Scheme as applicable to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms In March last it was decided that the Ministry of Pood should put in force a scheme to purchase Iraqi dates with a view to ensuring:- (1) Proper allocation. (2) jficoncmy of shipping and transport. (3) Reasonable price. The Political Resident was asked for his comments which he gave in his telegram No*981 of 1st May. He emphasised that the Persian Gulf States should be given first priority in such a scheme, and he gave their requirements as Koweit 5,000 tons, Bahrein 8,000 tons and Truclal Coast 8,000 tons. We learnt from the Ministry of Pooa cfeualls of the scheme in July and in our telegram 16612 of ^th July we reported thist to the Politcal Resident* He was told that though no guarantee of full requirements could be given, importance of dates to the Sheikhdoms nad been recognised and it was hoped that their full requirements would be met. He was asked to , arrange for the issue of import licences within the allocation made by theJML.S.C^ In his telegram T/748 of 17th f'~'Sugust he asked for details of the first allocation as the /Y&gt;/£££?*:)■/ ^' date season had begun. We told him in our telegram 19444 of 27th August to maintain close touch with Cairo and we also gave him the approximate prices under the scheme. In their ^^Savingram No.2378 of 6th September the M.E.S.C. gave their first allocations which included Koweit 2,250, Bahrein 4,500, Trucial Coast 4,500. In his telegram T/1009 of 9th October the Political Resident complained that the allocations were too small. He quoted a telegram from Cairo telling him that further allocations would be made later in the season if it appeared that further supplies would be forthcoming, but that for the present it should not be assumed that such would be the case. In their telegram Esmid 993 of 20th October, M.W.T. at our instigation reported this to Cairo and asked them to discuss tne matter with the Political Resident and agree all allocation figures. On 28th October in their Savingram 167tiI3C. Cairo told him that the exportable surplus ha proved/ jUA.EM proved grievously short of anticipation and tti wnm mentioned that they understood from their Buying Agent (Muchison of Andrew Weir &amp; Company) that his original figures were on the high side and that account had been taken of local grown dates. In reply to the M.W.T. telegram 995 of 20th October, M.E.S.C. stated that the Political Resident had not yet conmented on their telegram MISC.167. This telegram was repeated to the Political Resident, who commented on 12th December in his telegram T/1302 to the effect that Muchison's statement was without foundation and that all the States had been pressing for their full allotment. He added that the position was serious and that he was sending a special Officer to Basra to make enquiries. The present telegram No.2538 of 30th December is the result of these enquiries. The scheme is a Ministry of Pood scheme implemented by the l&amp;.E.S.C. The line taken here ,vas that so far as possible the Political Resident should be encouraged to communicate direct with Cairo in respect of it. The Ministry of Pood have promised to let us have their comments on the Political Residents telegram and to send a representative to the meeting which we are having with the M.E.S.C.

Ministry therefore propose at first to acquire as much of Basra crop as they can for export, leaving Euphrates dates for internal consumption in Iraq, where in absence of external Eja.licet prices are expected to fall rapidly. Buphrates growers will probably then be glad to aell to Ministry on buyers terms any quantity which can be spared for export. As it is considered impracticable to induce Iraqi Government to impose ban on export of dates not purchased by Ministry, scheme can only succeed if control is enforced by importing governments by refusal of import facilities for supplies obtained privately. As you had not till recently stated any requirement of dates for civil consumption In India you were not consulted in earlier stages but Ministry trust that you will agree to co-operate. It ie anticipated that dates will be obtained at pricea well below those demanded by Iraqi growers last year. 2. quantity/— t ^ 2 # ^uantitj of date* available for export cannot be forecasted acourately until crop la gathered, but wa are aiming at a total purahase of 90,000 tons in first place, against deuanda totalling some 176,000 tons, impendence of Arabia, and to leaser degree other Middle Jtest oountriea, on this crop as staple item of diet involves drastic reduction in other civil demands and you are asked to accept 10,000 tons in first instance in respect of Indian oiv^l requirements.

Dried Fruits Sub-Committee in London will allocate supplies between United Kingdom import programme, the Army, civilian requirements o f t he Middle East, Dominions and (if supplies - nave to be sent’ tcTIndia) India also, it is hoped that Middle East Supply Centre will accept responsibility for allocating between the various territories the quota of fruits set aside by the Dried Fruits Sub-Committee for consumption in the Middle East. 3, You will realise that if the scheme is to succeed,it is of the first importance that all territories, including the Levant States, Aden and the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf. shall refrain from attempts to purchase, or even from enquiries, except through the approved channel, i.e^ the Middle East Supply Centre.
