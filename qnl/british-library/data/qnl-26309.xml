The matter was fully discussed by the Regency Council who wrote at length to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad on the subject. His Highness has approved of the suggestion in principle and has instructed me to discuss with you certain details. 3. His Highness agrees to exempt from customs duty all government stores such as petrol and oil and materials for the necessary buildings for the operation of the detachment. This would include food, drink, material and equipment required for the maintenance of the staff and personnel, in a similar manner in which His Highness has granted exemption to the Royal Navy. The exemption from customs duty on food and liquor will include food and liquor used at recognised social gatherings or by honorary members of the Royal air Force messes or clubs, should such institutions exist in future. This point is specified in ordermmm * f ^ Vv 7872 1938 order to avoid the necessity of separate applications on the occasion of each entertainment, 4, The exemption relates to customs duty only and does not apply to other charges due on imports or local taxes or rates such as motor taxes and bridge tolls which may come into existence when the causeway is complete. 5, His Highness Shaikh oir Hamad would like to be informed when it is likely that building opera tions will commence and what is likely to be the strength of the proposed detachment.

P. z.1 SECRET. Sir, AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, W.C.2. 1938. I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to previous correspondence conducted under India Office reference P.Z.1686/36 on the subject of the location of a Plight of Royal Air Force aircraft at Bahrein. 2. When originally the Council decided upon the advisaoility of locating a detachment of the Royal Air Force at Bahrein they had in mind the conversion of No. 203 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron to landplanes and the allocation of a Flight of the converted squadron to Bahrein. They now expect that the necessary aircraft to enable thin conversion to be made will be available in the Spring of 1940, and that the accommodation for the flight at Bahrein could be provided by about the same date. 3. Before talcing any steps to give effect to this proposal the Council would be glad if the Secretary of State for India would be good enough to refer the matter again to the Political Resident, as requested in his letter of the 27th The Under-Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, S.

I understand that the proposal will he very welcome to the Shaikh, and conditions favourable to the Royal Air Force might be negotiated. A proposal that Royal Air Force aircraft should ue stationed at Bahrein within a specific period on condition that he would grant customs exemption on all govern ment stores for the operation of these aircraft might well be successful. I would suggest that it be stipulated that exemption be granted from customs dues on all Government stores, N.A.A.F.I. supplies, etc. Such exemption, although granted to the Royal Navy, is not granted to the Royal Air Force, and I understand from the Political Agent that it would be inadvisable to raise this question other than as part of a general proposal to locate a Flight at Bahrein.

Sir, I am commanded 'by the Air Council to refer to Mr. Clauson 1 s letter to Group Captain Peck (PZ.5027/35 - dated 2nd August, 1935) enclosing copies of correspondence between the Honourable The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Senior Air Staff Officer, Air Headquarters, Iraq, on the subject of trie possible location of a detachment of the Royal Air Force in Bahrain. For some time, the Air Council have had under consideration the advisability of locating in Bahrain a detachment of Eo.203 Squadron which is normally stationed at Basrah, but which in the present emergency has been temporarily transferred to Aden. The responsibilities of the Royal Air Force in the Persian Gulf are increasing and a detachment at Bahrain would be much more centrally situated and enable the duties of the Royal Air jjorce in that area to be carried out in a more economical manner. At present the 400 miles* flight from Basrah to Bahrain leads to delay in the arrival of the aircraft in the event of any emergency arising along the Crucial Otast, and the Royal Air Force should be in a position to visit Qatar at frequent intervals and be suitably disposed to come immediately to his assistance in an emergency. Under-Secretary of State, Political Department, India Office, involves in any event flying time. The rece Sheikh of Qatar renders it particularly desirable thatBefore crocceding further with their investigation of this question the Council would be grateful for an assurance that there would be no political objection to the location of a detachment of the hoyal Air irorce in Bahrain, should it be decided that it is desirable on operational grounds to do so.
