THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards herewith, for the observations of the Secretary of State, copy of enclosures in a letter from the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, dated the 14th November, 1912, relative to right of Muscat subjects to fly the British and Greiman flags. India Office, December 27, 1912. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Co 20, 1912. I HAVE the honour to refer for the consideration of higher authority, certain aspects of the grant bv His Majesty's representatives in East African ports of the right to fly the British flag to subjects of the Sultan of Muscat wholly or partly domiciled in our protectorates. . . 2. In June last the Political Agent, Muscat, asked for instructions in connection with a case of which the following are the brief salient points :— One Mussallam-bin-Juma'a son of the late Juma-bin-Salim-al-Ja'adavi, a Muscat subject of Sur, presented himself before the Political Agent. He stated that he was born in Mombassa; he had no papers of British nationality but claimed to be a British protected person, and, producing British articles for his dhow ' Jahad-al-Karim ' now lying at Muscat or Sur, said that he had sold her and wanted fresh articles for another dhow which he had purchased instead. Mussallam-bin-Juma has three brothers living wholly or partly in Sur: two of them own dhows sailing under the Muscat flag; the third, Khamis-bin-Juma'a, was born at Lamu, spends part of his time there and owns a dhow registered at that port under the British flag. . . . ..i . i • i 3. The species to which Mussallam-bin-Juma a belongs is just that which came into so much evidence in connection with the French flag arbitration, and I theiefore (in my letter of 4)th August) instructed the Political Agent to consult the Sultan fully in the first instance, so that if he had any objections to put forward they might be considered before further action was taken. „ , „ I attach a copy of his replv and accompaniments. The Government of India, will, I know, agree with me that we need to be punctiliously circumspect in all matters connected with the grant of flags to persons of Muscat origin, both in order to avoid misunderstanding with the Sultan and also to make sure that we are not caught tripping by the French under the spirit of The Hague award. 'V^ e^ need to be specially careful in the case of Suris like Mussallam-bin-Juma'a, who divide their favours, connubial and commercial, between their port of origin and their port of adoption. Accordingly, in the matter of the grant of the British flag, I support the recommendation of the Political Agent that in cases such as that under reference a ' no objection ' certificate should first be obtained by the protectorate authorities from his Highness the Sultan of Muscat through the Political Agent. 4. As regards the case of the Suri, Syud Mohammed-bin-Alvi, who has taken a German flag at Tanga, it is extremely unlikely that his ' resolve' to settle in Tanga permanently is anything more than colourable, and in my opinion the Sultan s disturbance of mind at the prospect of this renewed defection of his Suri subjects is well justified. . . , , . , As Syud Mohammed has his relations and real domicile at bur, he can always be got at by his Highness and it is therefore not urgent that the latter should act at once ; but I have the honour to enquire whether, after we have done the necessary to [2739 ee—1] 5ensure correctness of our own procedure in similar cases, the Sultan cannot be advised to confiscate the flag and papers and hand them to ns for return to the German authority which issued them; and if not, what other means he should take to assert his position. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major Knox to Lieutenant- Colo 8, 1912. IN continuation of correspondence, ending with your letter dated the 4th iiugust, 1912, I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information and for favour of communication, should you think it advisable, to the authorities of the East Africa protectorate at Mombassa, the copy of a certificate dated the 27th August, 1912, and issued by me in favour of Mussallam-bin-Juma'a, whose case was reported in my Confidential letter dated the 26th June, 1912. 2. Both His Highness and myself were much occupied in the close of August and I found it impossible to go myself to His Highness with Mussallam-bin-Juma'a and discuss his case. Indeed, I received a plain intimation from His Highness that he would prefer it to be discussed with the dragoman in the course of other routine business. I quote verbatim from my dragoman's note, reporting the result of the interview :— P. A.: ' Re Mussallam-bin-Juma'a of Mombassa, His Highness says that he cannot say anything as to whether you should give him a ' qual' or not, as the man is obviously a British protected person. His Highness said he himself cannot give him one, unless you wrote to say that you do not recognise Mussallam as a British subject. ' His Highness emphatically remarked that he has nothing to do with the matter; thus I believe he has no objection to your giving him a paper.—S. H.' Dated August 27, 1912. 3. This clear declaration of His Highness's views on the case appeared to me entirely to justify me in thinking that I had complied with your directions conveyed in Confidential letter dated the 7th July, 1912, to my address. 4. A similar case is that of Khamis-bin-Juma'a, the brother of Mussallam already dealt with. I forward herewith copies of his papers. All that Khaihis wanted was a pass to cover some old weapons required for self-protection in the Shatt-el-Arab. This was granted to him. 5. The importance of these cases is however brought prominently forward by a third case which I have now the honour to bring to your notice. This is a case of an Arab Syud undoubtedly of Muscat nationality originally, to whom papers have been granted by the German authorities in Tanga, East Africa. The papers are in German and I have had them copied as well as possible and forward them herewith to you for information and such action as you may think desirable. 6. The man's case was first regularly brought to my notice by His Highness though my dragoman on the 27th ultimo, though His Highness had some time previously mentioned to me a rumour that a German flag and papers had been brought to Sur. 7. His Highness stated to my dragoman that he could take the flag and papers from the man whom he had called for that afternoon but wished to know my opinion on the subject and especially what he should do with the flag when he had seized it. To this message, I returned the reply that I thought there was no necessity for His Highness to seize the flag or papers but that I would be happy to refer the case for directions to higher authority. If His Highness would direct the man to bring flag and papers here, we could save His Highness some trouble by taking copies or sketches of all important matters. I would however be obliged if His Highness wouxd lurnish me with all evidence showing reason for the assumption that the man was a Muscat subject, especially place of birth, approximate age, parentage, tribe, whether he owned property in Muscat territory or not. I further suggested that it would be as well to ascertain from the man himself the reasons on the strength of which he was granted German protection. Did he own property in Tanga ? How ong has he been settled there ? Does he propose to live in Tan^a, or in Sur, or partly m Tanga and partly in Sur ?8. After a talk with the man, His Highness sent him to me for enquiries, and I ascertained that the man was named Syud Muhammad-hin-Alvi. He was born in Snr, and is aged about 50 years. He owns a house in Sur jointly with his brother Mohsim and a sister, who both live in Sur. They inherited this house from their father, Alvi-bin-Mohsitn. Muhammad has been going to Tanga for the last fifteen years on annual voyages in his own dhow, named ' Eateh-al-Khair.' He spends a few months in Tanga and returns to Sur each year, but he has now resolved to settle in Tanga permanently. 9. His Highness tells me that the man took the German flag for fear of the Italians, and talks of returning it next year. But His Highness seems disturbed at the prospect of the Germans acquiring any interests in Sur, which is not unnatural after his painful experiences with the French prior to The Hague decision. I have now the honour to submit the case for the favour of instructions as to what advice I should tender to His Highness, but it seems to me that, if there is any idea of protesting against the German action, it is important that we should look carefully into the question of the action of British authorities in the neighbouring East African | Protectorates for fear of being accused of doing the very thing which we are protesting against. I would suggest for your consideration whether a simple way out of the difficulty would not be for the authorities of the East African Protectorate, where there was any ground at all for suspicion that an applicant for registration as the owner of a British ship was connected with Muscat, to refer the case to the political agent in Muscat that a ' no objection ' certificate might be obtained from His Highness the | Sultan.

The measures proposed by the resident, Bushire, in the fourth paragraph of his letter of 30th September, 1912, are, we agree, not desirable so far as S&gt; ed Muhammad is concerned. Our opinion is that the attention of the German Government might be drawn to the case with reference to Brussels Convention 1892, article 32, and that suggestion might be made that in uncertain cases m which it is possible that the applicants are subjects of Sultan of Muscat, the political agent at Muscat should in fiSt instance be referred to by the German authorities The procedure suggested by the political agent at Muscat in paragraph 9 of his letter of 8th Septembei, 1912, which was enclosed, is recommended by us to meet the other cases to which the resident referred.

It is important that Suris and other subjects of the Sultan of Muscat should not be allowed to receive flags to which they are not properly entitled, and it is therefore proposed to bring the present case to the notice of the German Government. Before doing so, however, Sir E. Grey would be glad if he could be furnished with information as to precedure adopted in the British protectorates on the east coast of Africa in order to ensure that the provisions of the Brussels Act in regard to the grant of flags are not infringed.

As regards the case of Syud Mahomed Sir E.Grey would propose, as a first step, to communicate the facts of the case to the German Government and to enquire whether this man is really entitled to the flag, as he does not appear, as far as can he ascertained, to 'be genuinely settled at Tanga.

Sir:- In reply to your despatch Ho.107 of February 7th relating to the grant of flags to dhows I have the honour to report as follows:- 2. In the case of Khamis 'bin Juma the facts are as follows (a) Khamis 'bin Jama's father immigrated to Lamu from Suri in Arabia some forty years ago and married a Swahili woman, ('b) He himself was 'bom at Lamu soon after the marriage and lived there until he was about twelve years of age. (c) He then for fifteen years accompanied his father who traded in a dhow 'between the East Coast of Africa, Arabia, and the Persian Gulf. (d) Eventually his father died and left him some money with which he bought a dhow, two houses and a piece of land at Lamu, and married a Lamu woman. (e) From that time up to the present he has been trading between this and Arabia, his home being at Lamu. (f) For the above reasons Khamis bin Juma claimed that he was a British Protected Person and the Port Officer at Lamu Tte.st Africa Protectorate. r o w y •4. Lama licenced his dhow under the Protectorate flag. 3. As regards the general question the following precau tions are taken to ensure that the provisions of the Brussels Act are not infringed 'by the grant of Protectorate flags to unauthorized persons: - (a) A rigorous watch is kept over the native vessels authorised to cany the Protectorate flag. (h) The owners must 'be either British subjects or British protected persons, (c) They must prove to the authority who issues the licence to fly this flag^ that they possess real estate, situated in the Protectorate, as a gurantee for the payment of any fines which might he incurred. (d) The owners as well as the captains of the Shows must prove that their reputation is good and that they have never heen condemned for Acts of Slave Trade or Illicit Arms Trade. (e) The licence to carry the Protectorate flag must 'be renewed every year. It can at any time he suspended or with- drawn hy the Port Authorities of this Protectorate. (f) The licence hears the necessary indications to establish the identity of the vessel.v .■ . &gt; - -aafc : ' s *iiJM£LWiau&amp; '■-SMBiBMfifP'- 0. 4. During the past seventeen years no oom owner or captain of a native vessel, registered in this Protectorate, has, to the knowledge of the Port Officer, 'been found guilty of infringing the provisions of the Brussels Act.

The measures taken 'by the British East African authorities appear to 'be generally adequate, 'but in the case of persons who may 'be of Muscat origin I am to suggest that the procedure proposed 'by the Political Agent in para, 9 of his letter of 8th Septeraber 1912 might 'be adopted as an additional precaution.

Major Knox's proposal is that the authorities of the East Africa Protectorate might refer to the political agent at Muscat when a case where there was any ground at all for suspicion that an applicant for registration as the owner of a British ship was connected with Muscat, in order that a 'no objection' certificate might be obtained from His Highness the Sultan.

I am directed to invite a reference to your letter No. 2254, dated the 20th September 1912, on the suhject of the grant of British flags to Maskat subjects residing in British East Africa. 2. The authorities of the East Africa Protectorate, who have been con sulted*, are of the opinion that if the proposal made by the Political Agent at Maskat in paragraph 9 of his letter XNo. 165, dated the 8th September 19.U is enforced, an owner of a dhow desirous of registering his vessel at one ot the ports of the Protectorate would be compelled to wait for a period of some two months or more for permission from Maskat before he would be able to do so. The suggestion would thus involve considerable hardship to the owners ot dhows, and although it would be quite feasible to give efteot to it, the authorities are doubtful whether it would be desirable to adopt such a course. 3, I am to request that the Government of India may be furnished with your observations on the above.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Govern ment of India letter No. 2266-E.A., dated 27th September last, and to attach a copy of the letter addressed to me by the Political Agent, Maskat, m connection therewith. I agree with Major Knox as to the importance which attaches to the Sultan being consulted at any rate before the dhow appears m Maskat Oases in point seem to me of sufficient moment for treatment by telegram, at all events one way, and by this means any particular case ought to be settled in three weeks, if a simple one, and failing such settlement the case would obviously be one demanding deliberate examination and postponement of issue of papers pending a solution. Thus if the authorities of the East Africa Protectorate were to write details to the Political Agent, Maskat, he would only have to reply 'Sultan agrees' or ' Sultan objects ' in the latter of which cases the claim would be discussed further by letter. If the above procedure is not considered feasible, then I would beg to fall back on the suggestion made by Major Knox. No. 195, dated the 6th November 1913.

From— M ajor S, G. K nox , C.I/E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to report that the Political Agent, Mask at, writing tinder date 1st June, informs me that he has gathered from a casual remark of His Highness the Sultan that His Highness suspects that^ some of his subjects of the Oman hinterland, apparently sympathisers with the rebel Imam, contemplate going to German East Africa in order to obtain German Hegistration certificates, and, armed with these, they intend to claim immunity from arrest or punishment by His Highness for participation in the rebellion. 2. The Political Agent further writes that His Highness announces that he intends to deal with any such persons in very summary fashion and that, if the German authorities protest, he will ignore their communications. 3. I propose, subject to your approval, to instruct the Political Agent to remind His Highness the Sultan of the message conveyed to him in Foreign Department telegram No. 41 D.-S., dated the 1st January of this^year. conveyance of this message was reported in Maskat telegram, No. 2, dated 3rd January 1914, to the address of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulr and repeated to Poreign. In reminding His Highness of this message, it would be necessary, I ven ture to think, to omit all that portion of it that refers to the grant of a subsidy. In addition, I would direct the Political Agent that he should warn His Highness that, while there is no objection to His Highness dealing summarily, but humanely, with those of his subjects who rebel against his authority and then seek to evade, by intrigues with Poreign States, that authority, it would be unwise to ignore the protests of Poreign States. His safest plan in these matters and one that has the full approval of the Government of India as indicated by their message already referred to, is to refer such protests to t e Political Agent asking him to take the views of his Government as to how such protests should be dealt with. Such a course is m accordance with tne precedent of his late father, Sir Saiyid Paisal, and is calculated to spare both His Highness and his constant friend, the Government of India, much trouble and anxiety.

C C-O , To Foreign. Sir, In continuation of ray letter No. 1747 dated 7th, Jun® 1914, I hare the honour to refer to ths wis® consideration of th© Government of India th© question as to whether th© time has not come for His Highness to proraulgat© a brief edict, for th© information of his subjects, and to communicate it officially, for th© information of their Governments, to Foreign Consuls, residing within his dominions &amp;nd doly ac credited to his Sultanate, indicating that th© laws of , Oman do not recognise th© transfer of allegiance of t Omani born subjects, Arabs by race, to any other Power without the spe cific assent in each particular instance of His Highness th© Sultan. It appears to me that such an edict, of which I have th© honour to enclose a suggested draft, would prove a conve nient reply to German and other enquiries of the nature r9f©r- red to in correspondence ©nding with my telegram No. 505, dated 14.3.14 to your addroas. 2. It is in the highest degre® unlikely that His Highness tne Sultan will ever be induced to sign a single certificate of the nature indicated but it might b© represented to him, as an inducement to rid ourselves and His Highness of a constant ly recurring source of anxiety, that th© promulgation of a regw^ar law of 'Oman on th© subject, notified to at least three Powers officially, will imrn both Ms subjects and th© Powers that transfer of allegianc®, except in the special form laid down by •Omani law, will not be tolerated within the territorial limits of •Oman. 3. It would perhaps not have been inconvenient, in the caseI of the three 'Oraanis already referred to, if Hia Highness could hare beeh induced to ask us to forward to the German Consul a copy of such a proclamation for his information# It may be suggested that such a procedure might invite th® application by Germany to be represented at Masqat and to conclude a Treaty with the Sultan of Masqat but such a possibility always threatens.all who may see it of our 'Oman subjects. Whereas it has been represented to us,Taimur bin Faisal, that certain of our subjects attempt to escape our lawful jurisdiction by proceeding to Foreign countries and there furnishing themselves with Naturalisation Certificates and, on return to their country of origin 'Oman,claiming to be under the jurisdiction and protection of Foreign States,of whom some are not even represented at^ our cap^al,nor have treaties with us, I,Taimur bin Faisal,hereby notify all and eachjmjj subjects of 'Oman of Arab race and nationality, born in 'Oman or the sons or grandsons of such 'Omani born Arab Subjects that,within the territorial limits of 'Oman, such natu^-ralisation certificates and similar documents will be treated by us as null and void,unless they are accompanied by a written document from uurselves or our successors,Sultan of 'Oman,specifically recognising in each and every case such transfer of allegiance from ourselves to Foreign States in the form hereto attached and signed and sealed by ourselves d our successors aforesaid. It is further notified for information of our aforesaid subjects of 'Oman that we shall,within the territorial limits of 'Oman,refuse to recognise as valid any rnddified dr special form of protection or good offices claimed by our aforesaid subjects of 'Oman under the said naturalisatioii certificates or otherwise,save in so far as we may be thereby bound.

Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to 70187 letter Ho. 1292-D dated 12th March 1914 to addreua in which you were good enough to call for a fuller expression of ay views on the question of treaties in the light of the observations made in Foreign Offioe letter Ho. 63 of the 23rd January 1914. My imaediately preceding letter Ho.^^ dated ^ July 1914 was to a certain extent suggested by Sir Elyre A. Crowe's re marks in the Foreign Jffico letter referred to. I had invited the views of the political Agent, liaaqat, on your letter first quoted, to which he replied that, in his opinion, «we have ••far less to fear from the possible slevation the French 'position in Masqat which, it is thought, night result fron a *3oint Agrewaent with France, than from the^ extension of •German interests in the Gulf which would follow the conclu- »sion of a secret Masqat-German Treaty.

On receipt of this opinion, I addressed the political Agent by telegram referring to the draft of the edict that I proposed that Bis Kighneaa the Sultan should issue# I pointed out that, diplomatically at any rate, we had closed the question of the AmmfiTraffic by the issue of the Masqat Arras Warehouse legula- tione and that I hoped by the proposed new edict to deal effect ively Kith the other vexed question of the transfer of allegiance These closed, to ay mind, the door to the main dangers of &lt;iernan V intrigue and intervention# f I proceeded to state what is, to ay aind, the most serious difficulty w® have to face# I fail^f to see how, even if w® man- aged to conclude a special arrangement with France, we could prevent Oerraany approaching the Sultan and the two Powers that ;| guarantee his independeno® with a request to conclude an ordinary , oomorcial treaty with Masqat giving Germany the rights of the -aost favoured nation# We could not well refuse such an apparently reasonable request as Cieraan stoomars call freauently at the | port of Masqat. The Gemans will ask for nothing rtore and will trust, not without reason, to their coanercial enterprise and vigorous methods, to giwe the® in die course a siore subBtantial position. W® should thus, as far as I can see, have given the now waning Influence and prestige of France at Masqat new life ana vigour without any oorre sending advantage to ourselves. fhe Political Agent concurred on the ae sumption-that I was correct in my view that we could not prevent a German ooaaercial . 4AAt.h of our ppopoBfld undfirBt&amp;ndlJis treaty with Maaqot In tho tswtn 01 with Vmnoeand Hlshn® 38 *I do not wish In any my to mdereatiiaat© or minimi 00 the 1 inconvsnienco, not to mjtho dangers,of German enterprise In the m&amp;t,but I think that we shall hav© to rely on the laxowl«%« which His Highneoe the Sultan no doubt nosaess- 1 es that we should greatly r^oont a treaty with Germany conclud ed without otr loaowledg® and approval and trust that Hi,® Highneas will not bo alow to realise on ?feldh aide hie inter- oats lie.

In reply, I would state that I have carefully con sidered the suggestion made and the notifications allud ed to and venture to adhere to the opinions already given in my letter quoted above for the following reasons 1, The notifications refer particularly to Sna form of obtaining protection viz: by grant of flags and arti« cles from a Foreign Power. S. The issue of these notifications did not immediately terminate the controversy which gave ther . That controversy dragged its weary lengHfc along for 6 more years and only terminated by a decision given by the International Tribunal at the Hague. The French Consul at the time refused to accept His Highness letter and its enclosure and it might possibly be argued that the S I M L A . Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of| notlfloatlona wore . u x tPa vlreo . or oth9rwla9 lnvalla; thoy did not of th 9m89 i y9a t9ralRat9 th9 at lBt;Qo The notlfloatlona run sons rlak of balng overlooked and forgotten and a Foreign rower sight plead Ignorance of then. Still more might Omanl aubjoots of Hla Highness find it, convenient to gorget therv and It la probable that Lyud Tamiur imaolr does not know 'hat they ware promul gated. 4 *. ' h9 ' 3aict suggeetod aeema to place matters on a more correct Hooting from the point of international law and has a wld ^soope. It does not differ greatly from the general law and practice of civilisod states dealing with auch questions# It contains no threats or punishmenta and merely says that within the territorial limits of Oman such naturalisation certificates and other documents will be treated as having no logal effect# It is difficult to aee what any Foreign State would find to object to therein, 5, There are no controversial matters, prominently to the front just now in regard to which it has been found / necessary to issue the edict in question, for the German or Persian problems cannot be considered to be public pro perty, as .vas the French flag Soori case. The edict would therefore take its place as a s 1 mp 1 e^nnouncement of acqti law, which His Highness had thought fit to issue shortly after his accession. I have the honour to be.
