The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, To The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. Dated Simla, the ^August 1952. Sir, Increase in the pay of Dr. O.H.

Lincoln, Vice Consul, hammer ah, at its. 720 per mensem. I am now to forward a copy of letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf No. 755, dated the 7th April 19 52, and to say that the Government of India agree with the proposal contained therein that as Dr. Lincoln’s present pay was based on his grade pay in the Indian Medical Department (viz., Its.500), and as his grade pay has been increased to Rs.6 50/- on his promotion to the rank of Captain with effect from the 15th June 1951, he should receive the benefit of his enhanced grade pay. It is accordingly proposed that Captain Lincoln’s present pay should be raised from its. 720/- to its. 870/- per mensem with effect from the date on which he has become entitled to the- 2 - the increiiient of Bs. 150 in iiis grade pay. A moiety of this increase will he payable by His Majesty’s Govern ment. 2. I am to request that with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government, the proposal may be sanctioned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. hJ.Copy of a letter No.733 of 1932, dated tiie 7th April 1932, from the Hon*hie the political ^Resident in i iT '/ the Persian &amp;ulf, to the foreign Secretary-to the Government of India, Simla. ? * H ' ’ ^ Emoluments of Gap tain C.H. Lincoln His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Mohammerah. I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with foreign and Political Depart ment letter No.f.238-H/29, dated the 20th January 1930. 2. It will he seen therefrom that Dr. Lincoln used formerly to draw his grade pay in the Indian Medical Department plus certain allowances as Quarantine Medical Officer. Jhen he ceased to he Quarantine Medical Officer these allowances which amounted to Rs.250/- per mensem, were paid to him hy tne Anglo-Persian Oil Company, fhe Government of India considered this arrangeiijent undesir able, hut it was considered that it would not he fair to deprive Dr. Lincoln of these allowances in view of the arduous nature of his duties, and it was proposed that they should he paid from Government funds and that his pay should he fixed at Bs.750/- subsequently an adjustment ¥;as made in respect of his conveyance allowance of Rs. 30/- per mensem and his pay was fixed at Rs.720/- i.e. Rs.50Q/- grade pay plus Rs.220/- allowances. 3. In Army Department Notification No.456 of the 25th July 1931 Dr. Lincoln’s promotion to Captain in the Indian Medical Department was gazetted and thereby his grade pay rose to Rs.650/- . In view of the fact, however, that he has been given a special rate of pay he cannot draw the increment normally due to him on promotion. I presume that it is not the intention of the Government of India that however long Dr. Lincoln served in Mohammerahand whatever his rank in the Indian Medical department was he should never get any increment. Further, as pointed out above, his pay was fixed at Bs.720/- on the basis of a grade pay of Es.50Q/-. It would there fore seem only fair that now that his grade pay is Ms. 650/- he should be granted an increment of Ms. 150/- on his special pay which should be raised to Ms.870/-• 4. The Government of India are well aware of the many years of good service that dr. Lincoln has rendered in an arduous and very expensive post. The entertaining at ivlohammerah, with a European community including Abadan, approximating some four or five hundred many of whom His Majesty’s Vice Consul is of necessity compelled to ask to nis house, is certainly heavier than at any other post in the Gulf. I feel therefore that dr. Lincoln’s case deserves special consideration. I trust therefore the Government of India will be pleased to accord him the increment that he has earned.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000c4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3634</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000c4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3634</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 29/58 'Diplomatic and consular expenditure: increase in pay of vice consul at Mohammerah'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-19T08:57:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 14; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the proposal to increase the pay of the Vice-Consul at Mohammerah [Khorramshahr, Iran], in 1932.The file is composed of correspondence between Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Government of India, Secretary of State for India and Foreign Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consulate</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Conditions of employment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0000c4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
