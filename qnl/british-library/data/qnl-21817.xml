Proposed contraband control centre at Bahrain* L ^(Received under Government of India, '5.A.D,endorsemfcufc D.6064-N/40 of 27th September 1940)* COPY. I 3000/80. Sir, Ministry of Economic Warfare 12th July,1940# 1 am directed by the Minister of Economic Warfare to request you to inform the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty that he has recently received definite information that plans are being made by the enemy to import and export goods by the newly-completed railway system across Asia Minor and Iraq, terminating at Basrah. 2. in these circumstances it seems necessary now to consider what steps can be taken to limit and control such traffic in the Persian Gulf or on Iraqi and Iranian territory. Mr.Dalton is already in communication with Lord Halifax in order to explore how far it may be possible to limit such traffic by action in Iraq and Iran, and it is hoped to despatch telegraphic instructions on this subject shortly to His Majesty’s Representatives at Bagdad and Tehran. 3. As regards the control of traffic in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Dalton does not think it necessary at present to institute strict measures of naval control in that region, he feels, however, that certain preliminary arrangements might now be made, in the way of organising an intelligence Centre locally, whose duty would be to collate detailed items of intelligence which could be passed to the competent naval authorities with the minimum delay, it will be appreciated that time is needed before such a centre can be estab lished, and before it can institute efficient arrangements for obtaining reliable information regarding suspect cargoes, the move ments of dhows, and the means which are being adopted to evade control • 4. it is understood that Bahrain would probably be the most suit able site in the Persian Gulf for such an intelligence Centre. Mr. Dalton would propose therefore to raise with the Secretary of State for India the question of establishing such an intelligence Centre at Bahrain. Before doing so, however, he will be glad to be assured that Their Lordships would not see any insuperable objection to instituting, in case of need, some form of contraband control at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, he realises that general questions of policy are involved, and would have to be fully considered by the Departments concerned before any decision was taken in this matter. At the present stage, however, he wishes information merely on questions of fact, namely, whether ships are already available in that area and could be employed if necessary on contraband control duties, or if not, whether ships could without great difficulty be nade available to undertake such duties. 5. The question whether naval control measures in the Persian Gulf are practicable has recently arisen in another connection. A pro posal is under consideration for endeavouring to reach an agreement with the Standard Oil Company of California regarding their ship ments of crude oil from Rae Tanura, to ensure that these shall not be sent to undesirable destinations. The question therefore arises how the Company can be induced to give an undertaking that they will not ship their oil to destinations which are not approved in advance by His Majesty’s Government, it would clearly greatly strengthen the position of this Ministry in the projected negotia tions with the Company were it possible to hint to them that, in the event of a refusal to reach any agreement upon this matter, it might eventually be found necessary to intercept certain cargoes at the mouth of the Gulf, it would, however, be undesirable to use this argument to the Company if it were impracticable for naval reasons to institute contraband control in the Gulf. 6. 1 am therefore to request that Their Lordships will be good enough to state the facts as they exist today; whether, in their opinion, it would be possible in the future to exercise contraband control in the Persian Gulf; and whether, if this were done, they would agree that the most convenient intelligence centre to serve it would be upon the island of Bahrain. 7.

Copy of letter Ho.IB/71/42, dated the 5th February,1943, from the Collector of Salt Revenue, Bombay, to the Under Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Depart ment , New Delhi. I place below for your information an extract from a letter No. I3/8/SG-49, dated the 21st January, 1943, IromHis Britannia i^esty's Consul for the Portuguese Possessions in India, Nova Goas- rt My latest information is that the Hun is endeavouring to siauggle out drugs concealed in coal and in the hollow of bamboos. Another trick, a very clever one, which they have resorted to according to reliable information, is the following. A young cocoanut whilst still growing on the tree is carefully operated on and a container with drugs inside is inserted into the cocoanut and the shell replaced. The wound eventually recovers and the cocoanut goes on growing with the 'parasite' inside it. I am passing this information on to you as it seems it might be useful to you and your colleagues, etc. ' 2, Information received from the Assistant Collector of Salt Revenue, Goa Frontier on tne 8th January 1943, showed that an Arab vessel *Ai3AL BUNO,' registered No.776, Tindal SHAHIB MDHAMED and NAS1R MDHAMED, arrived in Goa and had loaded charcoal and bamboos for shipment to Basrah. It was suspected that this Arab vessel had shipped al|ong with its cargo, drugs, medicines, etc., obtained from the German vessels sheltering in Mormugao Harbour, with tie object of smuggling them to ports in tne Persian Gulf. This information was communicated to the Staff Officer, Naval Intelligence, Royal Indian Navy, Bombay, nfy Intelligence Controlling Officer, tLer took the matter up and approached the Staff Officer, Naval Intelligence, Bombay, who informed him that jthfixssiLBxanx. Naval authorities were unable to intercept the vessel on the high seas and suggested getting in touch with the Controller of Enemy Trading. The Controller of Enerpy Trading suggested that the information be conveyed to the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Depart ment, Bombay. The information was duly communicated and later conveyed by the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department Bombay, to the Government of Inaia, Comnerce Department, the British Consul at Basrah and the Principal Officer, Mercantile Marine Department, Karachi, for further action. 3. It is now disclosed that the vessel AKBAL BUNG was raided by the Portuguese Customs authorities before her departure with the result that the following unmanifested cargo was found*- 4. The two cases of German drugs and medicines on examination were found to be stamped with the name V.M. SaLGAONKaR. This individual opened a general shop at Vasco de-Gama and until the war broke out he did a small buaness. After this he managed to get a sub-contract to supply vegetables to the German vessels sheltering in Mormugao Harbour. It was suspected for a long time that he had other connections with the Gentians • • • • • Arabs - Trading with the Enemy - Mormugao Harbour Goa, Portuguese India - • • 1 . 3 rifles and 150 cartridges. 2 . 1 bale silk sarees. 3. 2 large cases of German medicines, drugs and infections. / and . •.. •&gt;r c:.: - 2 - * and Italians, and ^as taking delivery of saleable cargo from them. The Controller of hnemy Trading, Bombay, has recoim. ended to the Secretary to the Government of India, Coniuerce Department, Simla, that V#II. SALGAOiihAR BROJ*, Mormugao ^ferbour, be included in the *»ar Trace lists. 5. Another Arab vessel 'AMANTULLaH' is reported to have left Mormugao Harbour on the 24th January, 1943,^ for the port of Basrah loaned with charcoal. From reports I uave received, there is every reason to believe that pilfered goods from the German vessels have also been shipped by this vessel. The Portuguese Customs staff carried out a surface examination oi the cargo aboard this vessel before her departure. I have passed this information on to the Principal Olficer, Mercantile Marine Department, Bombay District, who has informed me that he has cabled this information to the authorities at Basrah and has also forwar ded a copy to the Commence Department, Bimla. It is desirable that this information also be communicated to the authorities tt other ports on the Persian Gull so that a watch can be kept for the vessel in case she makes a call at any of these ports before proceeding on the Basrah, her final destination. 6. As it seems probable that Arab tracers will exploit Goa, as well as the ports in Kathiawar and Cutch v.here they find supervision to be slack, as long as prices rule high in tne Persian Gulf, it seems desirable to devise some method of speedy coim.iunications with authorities ext tnese ports who can be relied upon to taxe effective action to search suspected vessels as soon as tney arrive.
