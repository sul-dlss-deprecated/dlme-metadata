This Department letter No.32/M.P., dated the 31st October 1939 states their opinion with regard to officers of the all-India Services, who are the most likely to be required. This letter was not however intended to apply to officers formin- part of a reserve, including both the Regular Army Reserve of Officers and the Territorial Army Reserve, of Officers. The case of any such officer whom the Provincial Government do not wish to release will be considered individually on its merits. If therefore any members of the Regular Army Reserve of officers, the Territorial Army Reserve of officers or the militia are serving with the Government of Assam, and if the Government of Assam anticipate any difficulty in releasing them, the views of the Assam Government should be referred to this Department without delay, I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- P.
