The notes mostly relate to Curzon's travels through Persia in 1889-90. The notebook begins with general notes; later folios resemble diary entries, with date headings included from folio 36 onwards. Most of the folios have a vertical line drawn down the centre in pencil or ink; these lines do not represent column divisions, as the notes are written across the lines rather than in columns.Included with the notebook is a folded piece of paper with the printed address 'Clyde House, London Road, East Grinstead.'</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Travel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a7#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001452.0x0002a7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
