Although His Highness speaks and understands English it has been agreed by all concerned that as is usual in such cases an officer who is well acquainted with the Arab language and Arab customs should be attached to the party during the period of official hospitality. In the absence of the Political Agent, Muscat,who is unable to come to England owing to an immediate job of work a.t Muscat, the post has been * offered to and accepted by Lieut.Colonel G.D&amp;lyell of The Binns, C.I.E., a foimer Political Agent at Bahrein. 3.

I understand that His Highness knows English , so that I presume that he will have his Audience alone ? 3. Very many thanks about the hbbel arrangements - Mrs Dalyell of the Binns and I would gucsfar like to stay at the ’Royal Palace Hotel' just west of Kensing ton Gardens , where we shall be staying,before the Sultan’s visit, from the 23rd Marhh. Yours ever,?-p.Walt on , Colonel Dalyell will be provided v ? ith free hotel accommodation, etc., while acting as the 'attached' officer, but the Government Hospitality Fund do not normallj^ entertain as Government guests the wives of 'attached' officers. There are, however, a few recent cases in which this has been done and it is understood from Major Crankshaw that the rule would probably be relaxed in the present case? but he would prefer to let Colonel Dalyell raise the question himself. The Fund will pay all necessary incidental expenses incurred by Colonel Dalyell while actually on duty with the Sultan. This would not include travelling expenses to and from London at the beginning and end of the period of duty, but no doubt Colonel Dalyell will expect such expenses to be refunded. I gather from Mr.R.S.Brown that Finance Department would be prepared to agree to Colonel Dalyell’s own (but not his wife’s) travelling expenses being paid from Indian Revenues. Colonel/Colorel Dalyell is nov/ on leave pending retirement which will expire on the 21st April, and is in receipt of leave salary equivalent to half pay subject to a maximum of £111 a month. He is actually drawing the maximum. If it is thought that some extra remuneration should be granted to him while on duty with the Sultan, Finance Department suggest that he should be placed on deputation for the period in question, thus increasing his emoluments to approximately £160 a month. finance Department would prefer deputation terms to the grant of an honorarium which in any case could hardly be fixed at a higher figure than the difference between leave salary and deputation pay. Colonel Dalyell has already written direct to Major Crankshaw, asking for details of the programme of entertainment. Major Crankshaw is proposing to say that the programme is still under consideration and at this stage we might take the same line. A draft reply to Colonel Dalyell is suggested.Draft Paper. p 2 /5 03^ &lt;12 poli ti cal Department. DRAFT Lieut.Colonel G.Dalyell, CIE., The Binns, Linlithgow. LETTER. H ■ fY^As.

My cear Baogalls-y&gt; You v/ill have seen from the last paragraph of our telegram Fo.349 of 18th February to the Government of India (a copy of which was sent to the Foreign Office with India Office Printed Letter bo.i.. Z. 1129/38 of 21st February) that we have agreed that the Political resident should come home on brief Deputation (about 3 weeks to a month should suffice) in connexion with the contemplated informal discussions with the Sultan of Muscat. For this period of absence it is contemplated that V.eightiaan, the Political Agent at Bahrein, should act for Fowle without going to Bushire, where routine duties will be carried on by Galloway as Secretary and Consul. There remains the choice of an officer to be attached to the Sultan during the period when he will be in receipt of Official hospitality. The obvious choice is i.atts, who is in any case due to come home H. L. Baggalls^y, Esq., Foreign Office, S. .1. on/—2. on leave in April and who would be nost useful to Fowle in the Treaty discussions. The only objection to this arrangement is that if Fowle does come to London, it will hardly be possible to send Daly (who has been selected to succeed Watts) to Muscat and make him serve under Weightman, who is four years his junior, during Fowle*s absence. On the other hand 33aly, with no recent experience of the Persian Gulf, could hardly act for Fowle. In the circumstances the Government of India and we think that the course most generally convenient would be to leave the Muscat post vacant for the short period of three or four weeks while Fowle and Y.attc are both in London, and Fowle is prepared to agree. e should be glad to learn, as soon as possible, whether the Foreign Office see any objection to this arrangement. Incidentally it would give Daly, who is now in England, a useful opportunity to become better acquainted with the Sultan before taking up his duties in Muscat. Tours sincerely, (Sgd.) «J. P.

I have had a talk with Metcalfe about the arrangements to be made for an officer with expert knowledge to be available during the Party’s visit, and I have now agreed that Watts should go home for the visit, and that if Treaty negotiations are undertaken in London Fowle should also go. as for the negotiations, we have agreed with Fowle that informal enquiries should be made from the Sultan, while he is in ^merica, as to whether he wishes to discuss the Treaty or not during his visit; and the question whether Fowle is to go on deputation or not must of course depend on his reply. 16.
