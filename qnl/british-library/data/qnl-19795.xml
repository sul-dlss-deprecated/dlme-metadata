With roforonce to tho attachod statonont of tho Turkish dosortor,Muhammad bin Abbas who was boins kept in a state of practical slavery at Dalma Island,I vrould observe that the Sheikh's conduct and behaviour were by no means satisfactory. The S.N.C's Interpreter,who was sent on shore to communicate with the Sheikh and to inform him that the Senior Naval Officer and the Political Agont,Bahrein,would shortly be landing for a walk,was received with scant courtesy and told to return to H II FOX and report that he.did not wish us to land,that there n ' were a number of Bedouins and others with rifles in the village, and that he would not be responsible for our safety. Accompanied by the Political Agent,Bahrein,I landed shortly afterwards (5.0pm) at a spot about half a mile from the village. We walked for some time along the East shore but saw no one. Under the foregoing circumstances I left in H.M.S.'FOX' next morning instead of spending a day at Dalma as had been my original intention. I consider that the Sheikh should be made to understand that he is responsible for the good behaviour of his community and that to plead irresponsibility when he himself has allowed the illegal sale of arms in his territory is merely begging the question. Dalma Island is out of the vmy and it is for s considerationconsideration whether the people in the S.Y?. corner of the Persian Gulf would not be the better for sone evidence of the strong hand, e. g. A man—of—vrar night, in the near future, be ordered to Dalnca to demand the presence, (under safo escort) on board of the Sheikh to explain his conduct to the Senior Naval Officer on 8th July. A shot or two in the vicinity of one of his dhows or the temporary capture of one would probably bring him to his senses. I ghould bo elad of ■wonr ornnion with rrscarri to ahovo with me as to the desirability of doing something to maintain British prestige down in those parts.^7^ Buahire, 18th July 19M, Many thanks for your Interesting D.(K of the 14th July 171111 the attached statenent of Muhanmad bin Abbas, the Turkish deserter. I should like to make up a brief report on the subject and send on to Government of India, but I an afraid I shall not be able to support your proposals to show the strong hand at Dalma, a place which, such is ay ignorance, I had never heard of. Have you anything more than the statement oi the deserter to go on that Dalma had been importing arms? It would no doubt be easy to coerce him but it would not suit government*3 book just now f)o irritate a Shaikh so conparative- ly near - : in sa'ud and Qatar# They love letting sleeping dogs lie* What you tell me of his behaviour is just what I should have expected of an arab Shaikh who has probably never seen a man-of-war near his island in his life# ?/e don't want Bin Sa'ud extending his influence gradually towards the Trucial Coast and to coerce a man like Dalma, who has never done us any real harm and only wants to be left alone, would both alarm Bin Sa^d and make small men like Dalma invite him along and enter into relations with him# They have no idea of comparative values# Gould you let me have an official report in due course on the Turkish deserter episode, or would you like me to call for one from P#A# Bahrain or myself send one In on the inform ation in your D#0 .f All the notice I feel that I can take of the Shaikh*s rudeness will ne to write to the Residency Agnnt, Sharjah and toll him to tell the Shaikh of Abu Dthabi that I have learnt with pain and surprise that, on the recent visit of H#M»S# 'Fox* to DalmaJi Island, the Shaikh of Dalmah, who is a dependent of my friend Haradan bin Zaid, Shaikh of Abu -ain F.W, Gaulfeild, R#N. Dthabi mior Haval Officer, 'Pox wDthabi, sent a rude message to the Senior Haval Officer in the Persian Gulf and to the political Agent, Bahrain, re questing them not to land and stating that he would not be I t sponsible for their safety# X shall add that I have no doubt that this was due to fear and ignorance but that I do not expect such qualities in a dependent of the Shaikh of Abu D habi and feel sure that he will be dis pleased as I was to learn that British Officers of high ranl- ancl emrainent discretion/ were treated in this way by the (Shaikh of Dalmah and that Shaikh Zaid will not be slow to manifest his displeasure to his subordinate. I shall no doubt receive a polite and moderately satisfactory reply# It is quite amusing that his own 0.0. should have slammed the door in the deserter's face and a British sailor brought hi® along like a gentleman.

Addressed Secret-ary of State, repeated Bushire, No. 790-S. Dated 21st September 1914. It would be most undesirable, besides forming an incon venient precedent to admit that any islands in the centre of the Gulf appertain to Turkey, or to make any reference to Bin Sa'ud on such a subject, as Resident Bushire sug gests in paragraph 3 of his despatch No. 29 to Foreign Office, dated August 31 s 't' 1914-. It will be seen from a perusal of Persian G-ulf G-azetteer page 20 that no question as to ownership of these islands has ever arisen. It would perhaps, having regard to their distance from the coast be more logical to assign them to Kuwait, but that would be inconvenient and, moreover, they do not fall within the boundary assigned to Kuwait by the terms of the recent convention. In this connection, please see correspimdence ending with your telegram of March the 4th, dealing with the somewhat similar case of Halul. It was there suggested that, if the occasion arose, we might lay claim to deal with these and other such derelict sandbanks , in our capacity as guardians of the waters of the G-ulf and the riparian communities interests in the pearl fisheries. In the mean while, if considered necessary, we might in conjunction with the Navy erect wooden navigation marks^l. on them.

Sir, I am commanded by my Lord Commissioners of tie Admiralty to forward for the information of Secretary Sir A. Chamberlain the following observations on Foreign Office letter iio*T. 11510/10980/377 of the 25th ultimo concerning the use on shore of British flags by British protected persons. 2. It has been the practice for some years to authorise the use of the British Flag ( the defaced Red Ensign) by vessels belonging to persons under British protection who are not British subjects, e.g. Cypriote, natives of Somililand, of Indian Native States, of Samoa and Tanganyika; similarly vessels employed in the public service of Cyprus, Somililand, Samoa, Tanganyika and Palestine already fly the defaced Blue Ensign, As the inhabitants of these protected and mandated territories have the privilege of using the British Flag afloat, it seems reasonable that they should have the same privilege ashore in their own countries and, subject to any local regulations, in foreign countries. Whether the positionof 11 Iraq is so essentially different that the practice referred to should not apply to her, Their Lordships do not feel that They are in a position to judge. % 3. If and when it is desirable for British protected persons to fly a flag on shore. My Lords think that the Union Flag should be flown. I am, etc. (Sd) Charles Walker.

Sir, With reference to your letter of the 25t i September {T.11510/10980/377) onthe subject of the flag to be flown by the Palestinian community in Mexico, and generally as to whether British protected subjects are entitled' to fly the British flag, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state,for the information of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain,that they are only concerned with the flying of the Red Ensign which, without any defacement or notification, is declared by Section 71 (l) of the erchant Shipping Act, 1894,to be the proper national colours for slaps and boats belonging to British subjects, except in the case of His lajesty's ships or boats, or any other ship or boat, for the time being allowed to wear any other national colours in pursuance of a warrant from His ajesty or from the Admiralty. The flying of the Red Ensign is only permissible in the case of ships which are owned by persons qualified to own British ships in accordance with the provisions of Section 1 of the erchant Shipping Act, 1894, and the Board consider that the British flag could not legally be used on board a Palestinian ship. I am to add, for the information of the Secretary of State that a few years ago, the question arose as to the practicability and desirability of an arrangement whereby ships owned by subjects of native States in India, which were not entitled under the erchant Shipping Acts to fly the British flag, whilst flying their own flags in the territorial waters of India and other parts of tne British Empire, should be required to fly afe their national flag only the British flag on the high seas and in the territorial waters of foreign powers. For this purpose it was necessary for an Order in Council to oe issued under Section 734 of the erchant Shipping Act 1894, applying the appropriate sections of that Act relating to British national colours to Indian native State vessels, and a warrant was issued by the Admiralty authorising these vessels to fly the Red Ensign defaced with the Badge of the State in the flag.

'The question of ownership has never arisen and there is 'apparently no reason for regarding it as the property of 'one territorial power rather than of another'* Parsi. «The ownership of the Island, like that of Arabi, appears 'to be undetermined'. 3^ The word Parsi is of course Arabic for 'Persian', and Arabi means 'Arab'. Farsi is slightly nearer the Iranian Coast than Arabi, which may account for naming them so, without being attributive of ownership. vUJ-A 4, 1 ({v in vwtlt4 VW- #r I 'IfifM•*4, From most discreet enquiries here I find there is no suspicion that they my be particularly valuable for Oil thereabouts and. no disposition to regard either Island as belonging to any of the surrounding States.

Admiraltyi S.W.I 13th November, 1936. CQMI'IDENTIAL . e V ? My dear Glauson. May 1 refer to Eendel's letter No,E.5825/2902/91 of the 6th October, and connected correspondence dealing with the status of the Islands of Farsi, Arabi and Harqus in the Persian Gulf. The Admiralty concur with the India Office in thinking any claim which may be made to these islands should be made by or on behalf of one or more of our Arab clients. We feel that the present moment would be a somewhat inopportune one to suggest annexation by Great Britain. Annexation of an island, however unimportant, would provide Germany and Italy with a welcome dart to throw at us and might prove a convenient precedent for Italy to follow if she has her eyes on any islands in the Red Sea whose ownership is at present doubtful. £/ o / j We note with interest from the correspondence you subsequently sent us (Loch's express letter of the 1st October, PoZ.7366/36) that the Sheikh of ICuwait claims the Islands of I'arsi and Arabi. We suggest that further investigation should be made on the spot with a view to establishing a definite claim with supporting evidence. If you agree, we would propose that action should be talc en by telegraphy we think, in fact, that in view of the active interest now being taken in the Gulf in connection with oil, it is necessary to act quickly. feel that T.Clausen, Esq., COPY SENT BY AIR WWH. . ^ India Office, 0 f iS—lL ILO S .w.i ^3 11%lA jp it would be a mistake to regard the ownership of the.se islands as determined by the geographical position &gt; as is suggested by several passages in Rendel's letter of 6th October. The award of the Hague Court in the Palmas Island case shows that contiguity is not admissible as a legal method of deciding questions of territorial sovereignty. t| We would also like to draw attention to the fact that according to I.G.13 there are certain other islands in the Gulf of which the status has not so far been determined, for example Halul, Kran and Shura-Awah, in addition to islands such as Dahnah, Sir Deni Yas and Sir Abu Nair which we regard as belonging to one or other of our clients, but which do not seem to have oeen definitely taken possession of either by them or on their behalf. We suggest that it might be advisable to deal with all such islands at the same time, not only because the question of oil has now become an active one, but also because any attempt to establish claims of this character will very likely lead Persia to consider raising similar claims herself. As regards Farsi and Arabi, it may be of interest to you to know that a survey of the c oastline of these islands was made by H.M.S.TRIAD in 1927-28, on a sca,le of 20 inches to a mile. The fair chart of the surveys shows them as being low lying, 650,and 475 yards long respectively and consisting of sand covered with coarse scrub.

I do not think that any additional evidence will result from any further investigation. The status of these Islands has been fully enquired into and the results are given in P.G. 13, page 106. I think we can now take our stand on the Shaikh . of Kuwait 1 s statement, vide Loch's Bxpress Letter lo.0/187 dated the 1st October 1936, that Far si and Arabi belong to . him. 3, This being so I suggest that I be authorised to inform the Shaikh that he had better show an outward and risible sign of his ownership by hoisting his flag on these two islands. 4, with regard to Harqus please see P.O. 13, page 106. If Arabi and Farai belong to the Shaikh I should say that Harqus, as well, which is nearer to his coast, undoubtedly belongs to him. I suggest therefore that, should he claim ownership, (which I can ascertain through the Political Agent, Kuwait), I should be authorised to approach him in the same way as for Arabi and Farsi. 5. / J.0. /alton Esquire, OB. ,MG., The India Office, London.-2- 5, with regard to 'tlie other islands mentioned in paragraph 4 of the Admiralty letter.

Both islands are also used by Kuwait fishermen who set up their nets off the islands and they have in the memory of man never encountered any others, Arabs or Persians, there. 2, Harqus the Shaikh himself does not know under that name nor doe his immediate entourage and it seems that it would only be known to the older men among the pearlers and fishers, since it is hardly an island.

Dalmah Island is inhabited by some of the Qubaisat, Mazari 1 , Maharbah and Miraikhat tribes of Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh has a customs Mudir named 'Abdul Ghani bin 'All who lives in Dalmah. At the opening of the pearl season, the Shaikh sends two of his men, ? Ali bin Muhammad and 'Abbas bin 'Abdullah to Dalmah in order to recover his Taraz (diving tax) where they remain until the end of the season and then return to Abu Dhabi, 5. The Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast do not fly their flags except on Fridays or when H.M. Ships are in harbour or are being visited by distinguished guests. Dalmah is the name given to the whole of the Island including the village, but the eastern portion of the Island is called A1 Bahuth while the western portion called A1 Fuhaihil. 4. Bati (pronounced Buti) bin Muhammad bin Khalfun of the Qubaisat (married to the maternal aunt of the Shaikh, Wadinah) has a permanent house in Dalmah, but spends most of his time in Abu Dhabi, During the winter time the majority of the inhabitants (estimated to be about 600) leave Dalmah to the mainland and other neighbouring islands for grazing their camels and sheep.

Would you kindly refer to Rendel's letter to Clauson dated the 6th October, No,E.5825/2902/91, and connected correspondence about the status of cert ain^, islands in the Persian Gu lf? 2. You will now have seen Bushire Express Letter of the 15th January, 1937, No. 75-S, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on the 12th February, (&gt;f ,p.Z. 938/37. The position we have reached is that the Sheikh of Koweit claims the Islands of Parsi and I V' ^ 4 Arabi as undoubtedly his property by virtue of immemorial f lr| usage, that Harqus (which is not known to the Sheikh by that name) is used mostly by Koweit boats as a shelter in adverse weather, is nearer to Koweit than Parsi and Arabi, and is for these reasons regarded by the Resident as clearly belonging to the Sheikh also. 3. We are thus in possession of all the information with which the local authorities can supply us in regard Baggallay, Esq.. , to/ Foreign Office, S.W. 1.17 lo 2. to these islands, and Powle recommends that the Sheikh of Koweit should 'be informed that he had 'better show an outward and 'visible sign of his ownership by h o istin g his flag on them. Incidentally, with reference to paragraph 11 of Rendel's letter of the 6th October, it seems clear that the islands are not of any size nor do they possess any regular inhabitants or resources, and therefore it is presumably unnecessary to establish any kind of administration on them, 'but if we advise the Sheikh as proposed we should also, I imagine, advise him to send an official from time to time to inspect the islands and keep his authority alive. 4. ?v 7 e have now to decide whether or not to accept the Resident's recommendation. We assume that in the light of the information now available you will not 'be disposed to pursue the suggestion that His Majesty's Government should themselves annex the islands (as 'being res nullius ), and you may prefer that Fowle's recommendation should 'be accepted. But before submitting the paper here we should be glad to know the considered views of the Foreign Office on the following point, ' ,,,d8WvvW, ^ -simtm The/It 3. The information which we have received from the Sheikh of Koweit does not entirely dispose of the possibility that some other Power (Saudi Arabia, for example) may have, or advance, a claim to the islands, and might even he ahle to advance grounds of some sort for such a claim. But in the event of a subsequent supportable claim by the Persian Government or by the Saudi Government that the islands belong to them and not to the Sheikh, it would, we feel, be very difficult to go back on the Sheikh and admit the counterclaim. The question is therefore whether it is quite clear that if we decide to advise the Sheikh on the^ lines indicated in paragraph 3 of this letter, we shall be prepared to support him against a possible counter-claim. Or, in view of the fact that we are necessarily ignorant as to the existence or non-existence of any such counter-claim and of the grounds on which, if it exists, it would be advanced, would it be better to leave matters alone and not encourage the Sheikh to take action which might evoke such a counter-claim? We feel it is essential to get the point clear in advance, and I assume/~Ji — 4. assume you will 'bear it in mind when you consider the whole question. 5. If it is decided to accept Powle's recommendations in regard to these three islands we may, no doubt, accept also the recommendations in regard to the other islands which he makes in his letter of the 9th December, 1936 (copy to the Foreign Office on the 8th January, P. Z. 100/37). 6, I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal. rsgd.) M.J. GLAUSONBUSHIRE RESIDCNctni ^ p 0 Z .2909/37L nspv mw ^O- 1'% t. comijj'myjAL.

The Admiralty see no objection to the proposal that the Sheikh of ICoweit should annex the three islands Parsi, Arabi and Harqus, but we feel that in view of possible Persian reactions in other parts of the Gulf, it |^ill be as well for action to be taken in relation to-ithe islands at the same time or at any rate within a very short period thereafter. 3. We also wish to draw your attention to the fact that the list of islands m P.G.13 is not complete and that there are m fact a fair number of others, the political ownership of which does not seem to have been determined. Some of these islands, particularly thos e in the vicinity of Qatar, might conceivably be oil bearing, and therefore well worth claiming. 4. The islands we have in mind could be divided into three groups, as followss- Group 1 - Northern; off Coast of Al Adan (Latitude 27° - 28 0 N.) Parsi al Karan Arabi al Kurain Harqus Janah Jaraid Group II - pocks north of Bahrein - most of which cover at High Water.

The Admiralty suggest that the political Resident should consider whether sovereignty to al Earan 5 eMcu*.Vrfjf. ' tSi5-' 3 and al Kuram should be asserted at the same time. The islands of Janah and Jaraid appear to be too close to the territory of ibn Saud for sovereignty to be established without incidentj but we think that the political Resident should be reminded of the existence of these islands in order that their status can b'e determined. 6. Group 11. P.G.13 states that the Bahrein archipelago consists of Bahrein, Muharraq, Hum na'assau^ Sitrah and Habi Salih. The status of Muharraq is therefore already determined. it is only separated from Bahrein by a narrow channel and the Saltan of Bahrein's palace is m fact on it. Fasht al Yarim ^s, close to northward of Bahrein and t sovereignty might be claimed over this. Rajwa and Ghaschut are close to Saudi territory. Fasht al d'bal is between Bahrein and Qatar but closer to the latter. We believe, however, that Fasht al Yarim and Fasht al d'bal are really reefs rather than islands. The Admiralty suggest that the Political Resident should be asked whether Bahrein or Qatarcan make any claim to j'aslit al yanm, Najv/a, Cii^schus or Fasht al d'bal. 7. Group HI., The Political Resident has already recommended that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi should fly his flag on Halul^ Shura-Awah, Dalmah and Sir Beni Yas, and that the Sheikh of Shargah should do the same at Sir Bu Na Air. The lemaining islands appear to fall geographically into groups as follows;- id (i) (a) ^aiyinah is on the line Halul-Sir Beni Yas and closer to Abu Dhabi than Snura-Awah, (b) Halat Masuma is close to Dalmah.)

They do so because when the sea, as it often is then, is rough/, its anchorage is sheltered. At the seme time they can land to catch turtles and collect turtle-eggs which are marketable in Kuwait for India and other Arab markets. They also find there in quantity the eggs of the larger sea birds, a convenient form of provisioning of their pearling boats. They occasionally use QRAIN for the same purposes. Local opinion therefore is that the islands of _QRAN and QRAIN belong to Kuwait. S.

Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Att est ed. ik for Secretary to xhe Political Resident in the Persian Gulf# Im No.T/87-l/a/29• Office of the Political Agent, Bahrain on recess at Karachi, H From To 17 t*Dated 20th August 1937. nn Captain T, Hickinbotham I.A,, Political Agent, Baiirain at Karachi. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject: Status of certain islands in the Persian Qulf sir ' ^ I have the honour to refer to your memorandum No. 499-S dated June 25th 1937 and to state that my enquiries to date have elicited the following information with regard to the status of certain islands in the Persian Gulf. 2. Of the islands and reefs mentioned in group II oarasraoh 4 of the enclosure to India Office printed letter ^ b-'P ' No. P.Z.2909/37 dated April 29th 1937 the Bahrain Government claim Fasht A1 Jarim and F asht Dibal . These are two reefs and are covered at spring tides. The Bahrain Government f do not claim the Islands of Najwa and Ghaschus. I have not addressed the Ruler of Qatar regarding ohese islands as their geographical position would seem to preclude any possibility of his being able to substantiate a claim to them. 3 # in addition to the islands mentioned in paragraph 6 of the enclosure to the India Office printed letter under reference as forming the Bahrain archipelago the Bahrain Government claim the Harwar group consisting of nine isxands near the Coast of Qatar and also Qattah^ Jarada , Khor Fasht, and A1 Binat Islands. In paragraph 6 the Bahrain archi pelago is stated to consist of 'Bahrain, Muharraq^. tt . This is inaccurate as Bahrain is the name of die group ol islands2. islands and the group consists of 'Manamah, Muharraq, Um Nahsen 4. Of the islands and reefs mentioned in group II it is possible that the Ruler of Qatar might lay claim to Fasht Dibal, Of the additional islands claimed by the Bahrain Government it is possible that he might claim Qattah Jarada which lies close to Fasht Dibal, and practically certain that he would claim the Harwar group. I have purposely refrained from addressing him on the subject as I understand that at this stage it is merely required to ascertain whether the islands can be con sidered to belong to the Arab Shaikhdoms enjoying British Protection or whether they must be c onsidered as part, of the territory of a Foreign Power» Therefore provided that one of the protected Shaikhs claims sovereignty over the islands in question no further enquiries need be instituted which would probably give rise to undesirable controversy between Lhe Shaikhs themselves. 5. My enquiries regarding the islands mentioned in group III and paragraph 7 show that the islands of Daiyinah, Hashid, Das, Arzanah, Bazm A1 Gharbi, Halat Hail, Zirako, Qarnain, and A1 ! Ish (not *Isha) are either inhabited by or frequented by the subjects of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi would be able to establish his claim to sovereignty over these islands without his claim being contested by other states. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, who has recently made personal enquiries from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, reports that there is no such island as Halat Masuma y and I venture to suggest that possibly the island j3. island marked on the Admiralty chart is really a sand bank which is normally covered except at exceptionally low tides and may he considered for the purposes of these investigations as part of the island of Dalmah, 6, The Residency Agent further reports that no such island as A1 Fiha is known y but possibly this may have been confused with a creek of the name Midkhal A1 Fiha. It is probable thaty as A1 Fiha is shown on the chart as being close to the coast and mangrove swamps are noted in the immediate vicinity, in reality the island thought to be A1 Fiha should be considered as a part of the mainland located in the vicinity of Midkhal A1 Fiha creek. 7. While the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi claims sovereignty |.l/ over the islands of Halal, Shara-auh, Dalmah and Sir Bani Yas his flag, normally, is only flown on Dalmah. This is done on Fridays and when His Majesty's Ships visit the island. 8. The Shaikh of Sharjah claims Sir Bu Nu 1 air and Abu Musa islands but only flies his flag on Abu Musa on occasions similar to those on which the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi flies his at Dalmah. 9, With reference to sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 7 of the enclosure to the India Office printed letter' f ' under reference I am now addressing the Ruler of Qatar. I did not do so before as I wished to ascertain if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi put forward any claim to these islands before addressing the Ruler of Qatar. A further report9 report will follow on this subject. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your moat obedient servant.

Harqus (which is not known to the Shaikh of Kuwait by that name) is used mostly by Kuwait boats as a shelter in bad weather; it is nearer to Kuwait than Farsi and Arabi and is for these reasons regarded by the Political Resident as clearly belonging to the Shaikh of Kuvrait. The Political Resident recommends that the Shaikh of Kuwait should be informed that he had better show an outward and visible sign of his ownership by hoisting his flag on all three Islands . (See P. Z. 100/37 and P, Z. 9-39/37. ) Local opinion is that these Islands belong to the Shaikh of Kuwait. It is the custom of Kuwait pearlers to resort to A1 Karan where the anchorage is sheltered, for the 'Redda' or smaller pearl season; they also land there to collect turtles, turtle-eggs and eggs of Jea birds. A1 Kurain is used occasionally for the same purpose. The Political Resident recommends that the Shaikh of Kuwait should assert his sovereignty to these Islands at the same time as he does to Farsi, Arabi and Harqus . (See P.Z, 5575/37. ) Lorimer (¥01.2, pp.660, 901 and 905) states that these Islands must be taken to be included in the Hasa Sanjaq..

Before setting out our views may I congratulate you / on the very helpful sumnary which formed the enclosure to your letter, I has greatly facilitated, an examination of the question. For ease of reference we have affixed consecutive | ^ numbers to the island® in the order in which they appear in the margin of the sumraary thus: (1) Parsi (2) Arab! and so on to (3-) .iyarnet Pntin, (i,e, omitting /,! Pilia and Ilalat losunia from the enumeration)• We feel pretty sure tliat (8) (Iran is identical with (4) A1 Koran. e have not been able to locate on the Admiralty Chart (or elsewhere) (16) Al-Binat, but that is of no importance* 3, ab regards islands Kos, (6) to (53), (but excluding the island of Qrmn, marked (8)) we are quite prepared to concur in the views of the Political Resident, as su?rnarised in the enelosiire to your letter, as -to their disposal. The only ones a: ongst these islands which have even a re ote international Importance are (ll) Fasht al Yarim and (15) Khor Paaht, to which Saudi /a abia we suppose, put forward a claim on the ground of their propinquity to the coast of Hasa, and (18) Ilalul and (32) Sir Bu tla VUr, which lie nearer the Middle of the Gulf than the others (al thou, ever so much closer to the Arabian Coast than the Persian; and fliich Pers ia mi ht claim on 'general principles' if something ^erc done, like the hoisting of a flag, to draw attention to them. But we do not think we need concern ourselves about these possibilities unless end until they materialise, 4,/ Cibson, Esq.V |0 0 @ 8. 4, There reroain Hoe, (1) to (5) which a: e distinctly More of a problem* The position he -e mmto be that these ielancte lie a long my away froiri the K owe it coast and should at first sight belong either to Persia (e.g»Farsi) or more probably to Saudi Arabia, gainst this it may be argued (1) that Ko' eiti fishermen have regularly used the islands for yea-s and therefore Koweit has a claim based on prescription (this may be weak but in at least as good as a clatia based on propinquity)5 (2) that alternatively the islands are rcsnullius and therefore the islands can now be annexed by anyone, since it appears unlikely, though we cannot be sure, that either :e. sia or , audi Arabia have exercised any effective sovereignty in any of these islands hitherto, 5, In the previous correspondence it has usually been the Persian aspect we have considered, .Out quite apart from the Persian aspect, we feel that the present is ha dly the time to encourage our clients to embark on assertions of sovereignty which may annoy King Urn Saud, In our view it would be much better not to encourage the SheiKh of Koweit to take any forward step at present. But if v/e do encourage, or at least approve, his doing so, it should at any rate be with the reservation that the Sheikh may have to withdraw in the event of what prove to be well-founded claims being brought forward, as a result of his action, by Persia or Saudi Arabia or anyone else, 6, Moreover, m we have pointed out before, from the purely oil point of view (and these islands seem to have no other real potential value) we shall be no worse off, and in some ways shall be better off, if the Sheikh of Koveit does not get them. If the Persians get them the Anglo-Iranian Oil ipany will get the oil (if there is any and if the ownership is decided before the end of 1958), If King Ibn Saud gets them, he will also get the oil, and some money therefrom, tvhich would be all to the good, 7, Finally Beckett has reminded us that in these days, in order/[trt® i ' 1 ; order to Iceep islands wiiieh you claim, small and iminhabited / i though they be, it is necessary to display sovereignty fairly frequently, and to 'be able to produce arran ernents for their administration, even if they are only paper arrangernenta, Merely to put up a flag once is not enough, 8# I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal and if there are any doubts as to what action, if any, should be taken, it might be better to have a meeting.

The necessarily discreet enquiries made here about the xslands (l) to (5), failed to produce until yesterday tne following additional inforiaation. 2 * In tiie late Spring and Surnmer, sailing boats from the Oman Coast work their way up the Gulf and frequent the Islands (l) to (o) whereabouts they catch (a) Sharks, for tneir fins, rfhich are sold to China *~ where they are valued as an aphrodisiac - and also (b) turtle, for the plates ^om their shells (the final destiny of these is more obr.cure) for the Far East market, The Omanis end their tour at Basra, whence they return with dates. K)j ' 3. That the Oman is also frequent the Islands should I thought be recorded. 4. From this, and the fact that Kuwaitis have regularly used the Islands, it would seem likely to cause disquiet on the Arab side of the Gulf, - and perhaps, you might think, entail some fall in our prestige in the Gulf - if the Persians ao^uired the Islands, as it is suggested they might do, in Para 6 of the letter under reference. 5. In Para 4 of the same letter it is said 'The position here seems to be that these Islands lie a long way from the Kuwait Coast.' Hon»ble Lt-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K .C.I.S.,C.B.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf,)OTD /oS In this connection I should point out that Kuwaitis still regard their rightful frontier as where it was agreed to he in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they would probably hold that the Islands are opposite, and off, their rightful territory, and that if in Saudi-British negotiations they lost the territory that is no reason why they should lose the Islands, which might have, but did not in fact, go with it.By Air Mail.

Dear Baggallay, , mrnmmBm L lay I refer to your letter to Gibson of 11th January M: (Lo• i£.7J3Q/184/91 )about the sovereignty over various islands In the Persian Gulf. 2. As far as the islands numbered (6) to (38) in your letter are concerned we concur in the action proposed. Of the two islands omitted xroa the enumeration Al Fiha appears on Admiralty Chart Ko,28373 in Latitude 24° 17 1 3,, Longitude 53° 16' B,, while Hal at . hsuma is shown on Charts iios,3452, 3765 and 2837.0 as a very small islet just south of Jeairat 'Oalaah, It is probably low lying and may not be easy to see on account of surf. The identity of Qraii with Al iCaran has been confirmed, Al Bin t is not known, 3, With regard to the islands Hos, (1) to (5), however, we feel that you have OYerlooked one most important consideration. The assumption in paragraph 6 of your letter is that these islands are oil bearing. Admittedly this is at present only an assumption, but the possibility of oil is the only real value possessed by these islands. It must therefore be borne in mind that our main desideratum from the oil point of view is to secure oil on British or British protected territory over which we can exercise control in time of war, who develops this oil is of less importance, provided we can,et it and control its source. \ Bag ^allay, Bsc,, foreign Office, S,...l. British/l6 2, British companies operating in foreign countries control comparatively large quantities of oil, but the danger we have always had to face is that we may not be able to get this oil away in Admiralty oilers from a neutral country. Consequently it is highly desirable that these islands, if indeed the, are to be regarded as potentially oil-bearing, should be annexed by one of our Arab clients and not by either Persia or Saudi-Arabia. 4. e would like to suggest, therefore, that our best policy would be to advise the Shaikh of Kuwait to go forward with the annexation of these islands as was previously suggested, informing him that it is Just possible that other claims may be put forward, and that if these claims prove to be sound it may be necessary for him to withdraw. We could do this with a mental reservation that if Ibn Saud put in a claim and pressed it hard, it might be politic to withdraw - dependent upon the general political situation at the moment. If the Persians put in a claim, however, we see no reason why the Shaikh should not be encouraged to resist, unless the claim proved to be unexpectedly good. 5, I am sending copies of this letter to Gibson and Starling. yours sincerely.

My dear Gibson, f:.|0v&gt; I have read with interest Seal's letter M.06555/37 of the 26th February (of which he sent you a copy) about the islands of Farsi^ Arabi, Harqus, A1 Karan and A1 Kurain, 2. I accept entirely his view that it is more desirable to find oil in British or British-protected territory, even if the oil is extracted by a foreign company, than to find oil in a foreign country - , even though the oil is extracted by a British company. To this extent, I withdraw the arguments which I previously put forward to the effect that it would do no harm to let the Persians have at least the island of Farsi. 3. But I still do not feel very happy about encouraging the Sheikh of Koweit to go ahead and openly assert a claim to these five islands, and more particularly.to Arabi and Farsi. No doubt it is the right policy in principle, but I hardly feel that it is the right moment. Even assuming that we encourage him to go ahead with a mental reservation, as suggested in Seal's letter, to let Ibn Saud have the islands in the event of his putting forward a claim, and so eliminate the possibility of creating a fresh territorial dispute with Ibn Saud, this procedure will still leave us with the possibility of a fresh territorial dispute with Persia, 4. I have always felt that the islands were hardly worth such a dispute, but even assuming that the grounds for a forward policy are in general so strong as to stultify this argument, it seems to me that the present P. Gib: India Office, S,W,1, moment/\m (to 2. moment, with the world in a somewhat parlous state, is not the one to proyoke unnecessarily even a second-rate Power like Persia. 5, Moreover, there is the further possibility that we might be faced, not with a claim from Persia or a claim from Saudi Arabia, but with claims from both of them simultaneously. It might vv ell happen that both of them c u would, upon hearing that the Sheikh had run up his flag on all or any of the islands, at once declare that these islands had from time immemorial been visited regularly by their fishermen etc., and back these declarations up with arguments based, in the case of Ibn Saud, on propinquity, and in the case of Persia on the even less valid grounds that all islands in the Persian Gulf ought to be Persian and that one of the islands at least betrayed its Persian connexion by its name. 'It might not be difficult, from the legal point of view, to dispose effectively of any such arguments, but the question of Visits by fishermen etc. would probably become one of hard swearing on all sides. 6, In that case we should find ourselves involved in a three-cornered dispute from which we might or might not be able to extricate ourselves without loss of goodwill by dividing the islands up among the three parties or by some similar political deal. If not, we might at least have to agree to arbitration and in my opinion we ought only to embark on a forward policy if we are agreed beforehand that as a minimum we will be ready to suggest arbitration or agree to it from the word go. 7, We must remember that, in theory at any rate, Persia refuses to recognise our special position in Koweit It/9./ 10^0, /H 3. It is conceivable therefore that if the Persian Government heard that the Sheikh had asserted his sovereignty over these Islands, they might warn him to leave them alone, and send one of their gunboats to see that the warning were carried out. If they took such a line, we should have to intervene, perhaps with a counter naval move. Persia might then protest to the League (or might do so straight away) and if the League by any chance gave a decision against the Sheikh it would not be good for us or for our prestige in the Gulf. A withdrawal as a result of arbitration which we had ourselves suggested might be less damaging. 8. All this ocnsidered, I feel that if are to proceed with the action contemplated, it ought to be on the understanding (a) that it is made perfectly clear to the Sheikh that if the hoisting of his flag leads Powers who have hitherto shown little interest in these islands to put forward claims to sovereignty or ownership, we reserve to ourselves the right to require him to withdraw from any or all of the islands if it seems to us necessary, in our sole discretion, that he should do so, and (b) that we are clear in our own minds that we shall deal with such claims, without reference to the Sheikh, in whatever way seems best from the point of view of our political relations with the Powers concerned. An offer of arbitration ?7ould, as I have indicated, probably be the minimum that was necessary. But an even more accommodating attitude might be expedient,l! v 4, 9, The fact is that we cannot tell what claims may 'be put forward, what arguments will 'be adduced in their support, how strongly the Powers concerned will press them, or what our political relations with these Powers may be at the time when they are made. His Majesty's Government ought therefore to keep their hands absolutely free to deal with the claims as may seem best to them when the time comes from the point of view of pure expediency. 10. Finally, looking at the matter from another angle altogether, there is the consideration that the Sheikh's own position seems a little insecure at the present time (see the Political Resident's express letter No. C. 149 of ^ the 22nd March). 11. I am sending copies of this letter to Seal and Starling. Yours ever. (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay.P.Z.2903/38. Petroleum Department, (Mines Department), Dean Stanley Street, Millbank, London, S .W .I. SECRET. E5tii April, 1938. My dear Gibson, I have read the recent correspondence 'between yourself, Baggallay and Seal about the status of certain islands in the Persian Gulf. While I agree that it is generally desirable that we should lose no opportunity of obtaining rights in the Persian Gulf which, in the event of the discovery of oil, would be of great value to us, I feel that the present is hardly an opportune time to raise the question of the status of these small islands, particularly if there is a possibility of Iran raising a question that the islands belong to her. The recent trouble in Mexico has emphasised how essential it is, for the present at any rate, to avoid creating a source of friction and ill-feeling between ourselves and foreign oil-producing countries in which British companies are operating. This point is brought out in the memorandum on the Mexican situation which we recently submitted fco / the Oil Board and of which I enclose a copy. Bearing in mind the extent of our dependence for our oil supplies on foreign countries, of which Iran is one of the more important, I feel that it would be a dvi sable if the question of the ownership of these islands in the Persian Gulf were left in abeyance for the time being. T am sending a copy of this letter to Seal and Baggallay. Yours sincerely, Gibson, Esq., (Sgd.) E. C. Starling. 1 Office. S .W .I.\\\ liU p, Z ,29 AHM1X . OIL BOARD . The expropriation by the Mexican G overnment ol' the properties oi 1 the Oil Companies in Mexico . Memorandum by the Petroleum Department . An event of considerable importance which may, directly or indirectly, have serious repercussions on die problem of the supply of oil to this country in time of emergency, has recently occurred in Mexico, and it is considered desirable to bring the matter to the notice of the Oil Board. On 18th March last, the President of Mexico issued a decree expropriating the properties of the foreign oil companies in Mexico. Por a number of years the oil companies have experienced considerable difficulties with the Mexican authorities on a number of points, including thu confirmation of existing concessions, the grant of new- concessions, the employment of foreign technical staffs and claims by the workers for higher wages and the adoption of measures which have increasingly inceift/red v /ith the management in their conduct of the industry. In November, 1936, the Petroleum Workers' Union presented to the companies a draft Collective Contract which contained provisions for improved rates of wages and a numbei of claims which even in advanced industrial countries could only t)© described as tantastic* 3. Negotiations on this draft contract were carried on under threat of a general strike, which actually broke out towards/ ^O.B. 247 bla @ Jt, lli&gt; towards the end of May, 1937. After a short period the Workers' Union decided to take their case to the Labour Board as an economic issue. After investigation by a Committee of Experts and then by the Federal Labour Board, an award was made which would have cost the companies an additional annual amount equal to the whole of their profits during the preceding two years, and, with strike pay and arrears, would have amounted in 1938 to the whole of the profits of the three preceding years. The companies appealed to the Supreme Court who without investigating the profitability of the industry confirmed the award of the Labour Board. 4, Although the companies made it clear that they could not continue in operation if the award were imposed on them, they continued to negotiate with the Workers' Union and the day before the Expropriation Decree was issued the Labour Board had agreed to a further extension of five days to enable discussions to continue. This was withdrawn the same day and the President of Mexico in a broadcast speech the following day announced the Expropriation Decree. In their final offer the companies had made it clear that they were prepared to agree to improvements in wages and conditions of service which would have amounted to a total of 26 million pesos per annum (£l-g- million). This was the amount which the Labour Board claimed their award would involve, but the companies maintained that actually the award of the Labour Board would have involved them in an increased annual charge of 40 to 45 million pesos (£E-|- to £2-g- million). 5. H.M. Minister in Mexico has expressed the view that the Supreme Court was directed to give judgment against the companies/ ^ / ,W ' PIW8./ lK(v5) f/i&gt; o. companies and subsequent events have shown that the action taken by the Government has been prompted by political considerations and not because the conditions of service o.t the workers were inadequate. 6. The Mexican Government have stated that they propose to compensate the companies, but it is considered unlikely that any adequate compensation will be forthcoming. 7. In a telegram to H.M. Minister in Mexico sent on the 6th April instructing him to protest against the action taken and to demand a return of the properties, the following views are expressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; 'The general right of a Government to expropriate properties in the public interest ana on payment of adequate compensation no doubt exisos, but this principle does not serve to justify expropriation which are essentially arbitrary in character. In the present case not only is no clear ground of public interest alleged, but it is difficult to see that any such ground can in tac-c exist. Labour conditions in the oilfields were certainly not such as to warrant an action (or penalty)' out of all proportion to the situation on which it is said to be based. 'Expropriation is, moreover, the culminating point of a series of events, and the question o± its validity cannot be separated from the nature ox those events which are such as to render it impossible to escape the conclusion that the . . Companies were confronted for ulterior mouiv'es an award unjustified on the facts and beyond their economic capacity to fulfil. This award has in lus turn been relied on as justifying an expropriation, the real nature of which appears to be political ana to have little to do either with labour conditions or any true interest of Mexico. 'In theso circumstances H.M. Government, to whom the wider interests at stake are incomparably more vital than those of the United States Government, could hardly fail to provide these Latin-American countries with a potent incentive to lollow the Mexican example if they were to acquiesce m the loronosition that the dominant issue m the present instance is merely one of providing adequate compensation for British shareholders despoiled, ox their pro'Derties. In their view the essential issue is the justifiability of the expropriation itself, and the situation is of a character which can only be remedied by a restitution of the properties,'8. The present position so far as the Companies are concerned is that they have filed application in the Courts for injunctions on the grounds that the expropriatior of the properties is unconstitutional. In the meantime they have refused to enter into any discussions as to the methods and the basis on which they should 'be paid compensation. 9. The Oil Companies affected are British and American, the former accounting for about 65^ of the Mexican oil production. The British company is the Mexican Eagle Oil Company, which is managed by the Shell Grotip which hold about 20fo of the capital. 10. In the absence of any material supplies of petroleum in the British Empire the assurance of supplies of oil to meet the needs of this country in time of emergency rests in a large measure on freedom of access to sources of production in foreign countries. As the Oil Board is aware, British oil companies have established an important position in a number of countries as producers and they also furnish the facilities- in regard to refineries, tankers for sea-transport, storage and distribution v /hich are necessary to make the crude oil availaole ioi the needs of consumers. The existence of this organisation is vital if our needs in emergency are to be met. 11. While on the basis of (a) the total oil production in Mexico in recent years (5 to 6 million cons per annum), (b) the quantities which we normally take in peace time (varying from 5 to 10 per cent, of our imports in ^he j.asc three years) and (c) the quantities which have been allocated under the various contingencies in an emergencj. (li- to If million tons), it may prove to be practicable to make/make other arrangements, it lias to 'be 'borne in mind that Mexico possesses much greater possibilities than are indicated by the output of recent years. 12. During the last War Mexico was the second largest supplier to this country and during the period of the War her output increased from 4 to 9 million tons per annum. In 19SI it was nearly 30 million tons, and thereafter largely due to political difficulties it rapidly fell away. The oil companies have been chary of putting in new capital; hut two or three years ago the Mexican Eagle Company proved a large new field {the Poaa Rica field) with a much better quality oil than had formerly been obtained in Mexico, and output of the country was beginning to increase again. In ordinary circumstances Mexico might therefore have been expected to become again of considerable importance as a supplier to this country. 13. These possibilities are likely to disappear if the Mexican Government adhere to their present intentions. Indeed it may well be that, without the technical help which the oil companies have supplied, Mexico may find it difficult in the course of a few years to do more than meet her own requirements. 14. Information supplied by H.M. Minister in Mexico indicates that the Mexican Government has already been making efforts in certain other Latin-American countiies to secure the adoption of a similai policy. If theot efforts were to be successful a very serious situation would arise. It is unfortunately the ease that the GOTernments of some of these countries are somewhat unstable, and, while at the moment H.M. Ministers In Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru, who hayo been asked to report/111 5. report any signs of Mexican efforts, do not consider that there is any immediate danger of these countries following suit, the possibility of a change of Government having undesirable consequences is not ruled out by them; 15. There is not a large number of countries with a substantial production of oil. There are only eight countries with a production of 4 million tons or over and these account for over 94 per cent, of the world's output. The countries are as follows; Output in 1936. Percentage of Million Tons. World Output. U.S.A. 148.1 60.6 Russia E7.0 -^•9 Venezuela 22.7 9.3 Roumani a 8.6 3.5 Iran 8.2 3.3 Dutch East Indies 6.1 2.5 Mexico 5.5 2.2 Iraq 4.0 1.6 16. Of these countries the uncertainty concerning the operation of their Neutrality Legislation has caused us to rule out the U.S.A. under several contingencies, except so far as supplies to Canada are concerned. Russian exports have fallen to a negligible quantity and in the event of war would probably cease. The Dutch x^ast Indieo, Roumania and Iraq, because ot their geographical situation are regarded as doubtful sources oi supply in ceitain eventualities. This only leaves Iran, Venezuela, Mexico and certain smaller producers oi which Colombia and leo-u, with an output of about 5 million tons between them, come next on the list. 17. in the case of Iran it will be remembered that a few years ago the Iranian Government suddenly cancelled the Anglo-Irani an Oil Company's concession and H.-iu. Government/'7@&gt; (1° 7. Government took the case to Geneva before a settlement was reached. There the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs conducted the case for H.M. Government. 18. Not only are the Latin-American countries important 'because of their size of production, but because they are favourably placed from a sea transport point of view. 19. Even, therefore, should it prove to be impracticable to secure a reversal of Mexican policy, it is hardly necessary to emphasise the need of making every effort to ensure that the Mexican policjr is not followed by other latin-American countries. 20. The Foreign Office through diplomatic channels are making every effort to deal with the situation, including approaches to the United States Government through H.M. Ambassador in Washington. At the moment, however, it seems unlikely that the United States Government will join with H.M. Government in a joint or parallel approach to the Mexican Government. It is difiicult at the moment uo ascertain exactly what their policy is, bub there are certain suspicions that they may not object to uhe removal of foreign interests in the Latin—American councries which in the end may open up a possibility of the United States interests getting oack to the exclusion of the lest. 21. While the United States are not concerned as this country is in the Question of oil supplies in times of emergency, they have always shown the greacest keenneoS co take nart in oil development wherever oil exists, axid there have in the past been several occasions when this matter has been the subject of discussion between the two Governments. In recent talks which H .M. Ambassador has had with the State Department they have expressed their understanding/j&gt;l 8. understanding of our position, and in spite of.their good- neighbour policy they will not he surprised that this country should desire to take every practicable step to safeguard its position in regard to oil supplies in these Latin-American countries. 22. Apart from pursuing action through diplomatic channels, which the Foreign Office are doing, some consideration has been given by the Departments concerned to the possibility of exercising some form of economic pressure in Mexico. There is a trade balance between this country and Mexico greatly in favour of the latter; but a substantial proportion of the imports are represented by oil. With the present Mexican Government at any rate it may be doubtful whether economic pressure would result in the reinstatement of the Companies. On the other hand, retaliation against Mexico's arbitrary action is likely to serve as a deterrent to the other South American Oil producing countries, which otherwise might be encouraged to follow Mexico's example. 23. Suggestions so far considered have included (1) an increased tariff on Mexican imports; (2) the prohibition of some or all imports from Mexico. The adoption of either course is not free from difficulty but it is thought probable that a prohibition of imports from Mexico is less preferable as a form of reprisal than a tariff increase which might be imposed in an elastic form, i.e. applicable to all imports, with powers to exempt certain commodities. 24. The major oil companies will not of course facilitate the sale of any surplus oil by Mexico and efforts are being made to deny the use of tankers for the transport of Mexican oil.l&gt;&gt; 9. 25. The further consideration ox possible action by H.M. Government in regard to economic pressure has been deferred until the views of the Oil Board on this point could be obtained. 26. It is suggested that in view of the very important issues raised by the action of the Mexican Government the Oil Board should give their full support to any action of this kind which is likely to assist in making an example of Mexico; it will then be for the Departments concerned to pursue their consideration of the action which is possible and to obtain Cabinet approval. 27. At the same time this incident does draw attention to the desirabilitj?' of watching very closely in future the situation in those oil producing countries on which this country is bound to rely for supplies. It is suggested that special steps should be taken to deal with any causes of friction Y/hich may now exist or arise in future, that possibly more frequent visits should be paid by H.M. Ships with the object of cultivating good relationships and that H.M. Ministers in the countries concerned should be asked to advise whether there are any other directions in which they consider that action might be taken which would strengthen our position. 28. A Table is attached showing the principal sources of oil supply in this country| the outputs of Crude Oij. of those countries, their relationship to World Output, during the years 1935, 1936 and 1937; and the maximum allocation to these sources in an emergency. letroleum Department. 8th April, 1938.P.Z.3914/38. Military Branch, ADMIRALTY, S.W.I. 3rd June, 1938. Dear Gibson, A8.yI rej-er to the letters which you have received ^ A.//3. j.rom Laggallaj'' and Starling (dated 11th April and 25th April respectively) on the subject of the Islands of Parsi, Arabi, Harqus, A1 Karan and A1 Kurain. After careful consideration of the points made in these letters, we are prepared to agree that for the present at least, the balance ox advantage probably lies in not doing anything bo stimulate the Sheikh of Koweit to take such overt action to assert a claim to the Islands as is likelj^ to attract notice in Persian or Saudi Arabian quarters. We should like to make it clear, however, that in concurring in this view we do so on the definite understanding that these islands are regarded as appertaining to Koweit and that if the Persians make any move towards claiming them, we shall take the matter up on the Sheikh's behalf. In addition, we should like to suggest that it might be worth while considering whether, short of an obvious move such as hoisting a flag, there are not some relatively unobtrusive methods by which the Sheikh might consolidate his claim to sovereignty over these islands, e.g. by exercising some control over Koweiti and any other vessels there. Some excuse for doing this, if it is not already done, should we imagine, quite easily be found, and once some sort of control is established it ought not to be difficult to increase it gradually. It seems to us that if nothing is done, there is always the danger in Gibson, Esq., ia Office, S.W.I. these/ M.02607/38.

It seems all the more important that the Sheikh's case should be as strong as possible in the event of counter claim since our prestige would, in view of the local opinion that these five islands belong to him, suffer badly i.L we ever had to acquiesce in the award of any of them to Persia or Saudi Arabia.

We iiaTe no reason to believe that either Persia or Saadi Arabia will put forward a claim to these islands. At the same time for us to stand aside and do nothing means that if either of those countries stakes a prior claim to the islands by plant- -ing its flag on them they are def initely lost to us as British protected areas which may produce oil. Owing to the problematical nature of our supply of oil from Abadan in an emergencyt which I hare stressed more than once, it seems to me most important to secure every oil area we can on the Arab side. On the other hand if we encourage the yhaiKh of Kuwait to plant his flag on these is lands | we can inform him that ihould any other Power produce stronger claims than his, he will have to surrender them. I am afraid tiiat I entirely disagree with the Foreign Office suggestion in their paragraph 8 that we should deal with any claims to the Islands made by foreign Powers not on their merits but on purely political grounds, This would mean that, even if the Shaikh's claim to these islands were found to be stronger than a foreign claim, nevertheless, from motives of political expediency, we might sacrifice his interests, 4, As a matter of fact the danger of a claim from Persia or Saudi Arabia arising merely out of the Bhaikh*s planting his flag on these islands is not I think,very great, The actual planting of the Shaikh's flag would, not/12- 3679A ' INDIA OFFICE, POLITICAL D epartment.

There would appear to be no objection, therefore, to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company including these Islands in their calculations if they so desire. 4. There remains the question of Sirri. The effective occupation of this Island by Persia since 1887 and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty's Government (and of the Sheikh of Sharjah under protest) make it difficult, if not impossible to dispute the long-standing Persian claim and if the Island is sufficiently interesting from the oil point of view, it would seem best for the reasons given in the Foreign/.. „„ • tl-ll ,i ir sSjs 'w —&gt; (2^ fll Foreign Office letter to let the Company include it in the 100,OOu square miles without making any reference to its doubtful ownership .

The Company need this information in view of the fact that they must before the 31st December next choose 100,000 square miles of Persian territ ory and operate their concession within these 100,000 square miles only thereafter. In the first place, Elkington and Mylles wished to see the texts of the two instruments which are mentioned in the Ml % 4W. Perso-Iraq Frontier Treaty of the 4th July 1937, i.e. the protocol oi the 4th November 1913 and the proces-verbaux of the Delimitation Commission of 1914 insofar as they lay down the boundary at the mouth of the Shatt—el-Arab. I showed them these two documents and let them take notes of the important passages ( see Page 4 of the protocol, eleven lines from the bottom of the page, and page 11 (Deuxieme Seance) in the proces verbaux. 3. I explained that the position was complicated by the fact that, even in 1914, the Commissioners had said that the frontier started at a point which was in fact an appreciable distance from the mouth of the river, and that since 1914 the land on either side of the mouth of the river had grown still further, but added that v /e were reasonably confident that, if it came to the point, we could dispose of this difficulty, and uphold the contention that the frontier between Iraq and Iran, as laid down by the 1913-1914 documents and confirmed by the Treaty of the 4th July 1937, followed the low water line on the ( left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab until the river reached the 0 Pen sea. r' Gibson Esq. 4 * //m 2. 4. With regard to the Cjuestiori. of what line the frontier Qhould follow when once it reached the open sea (which v/e took to 'be when it reached the extreme southerly tip of Marakat Abadan), I said thatj in the opinion of His Majesty's Governmentp the most natural J simple and reasonable method of dividing territorial waters was to plot a line all points on which were eouidistant from the nearest points on the two coasts, which was another way of saying that a ship would always he in the territorial waters of the country to whose coast it ha pened to he closest at any particular moment. I made it clear, however, that this was only the opinion of His Majesty's Government, and that the point could not he said to he covered hy international law, since no rule of law had grown up hy custom and there had never heen any authoritative arbitral decision. 5. Ellington and Mylles then asked for information upon the status of the following islands - Sirri, Nahiya Farur, Farur, Nahiya Tuhb, Tunh and Ahu Musa. 6. I explained that Sirri had heen occupied hy the Persians in 1887, and effectively administered hy them ever since, and that we had from time to time recognised that the Persians were in effective occupation hy notifying them when British survey vessels, for example, wished to go there; hut that we had also always made it clear that this recognition of the de facto position did not imply t at we admitted in any way that they had any legal right to the sovereignty of the island. On the other hand, we were prepared, as the Persians knew quite well, to Recognise their sovereignty over the island as part of a general settlement of Persian Gulf questions. 7. With regard to the others, the position of ITahiya Parur was that it was indeterminate, inasmuch as it had never heen recognised hy us as belonging to Persia. At the same time, no one/3. one else had any good claim to itj and it was most unlikely that q we would wish to make any trouble in the event of Persians claim ing it as oheirs. In all pr oh ah i 1 i t y &lt;, the Persians had in fact regarded it as theirs for many years pasty and would quite likely Tdc surprised and indignant at any suggestion to the contrary. Parur was unquestionably Persian. Nahiya Tunh, Tunh and Ahu Musa, on the other hand, wore unquestionably Arah - or at least so we alv/ays maintained - although the Persians clai med them in the same way as they claimed Bahrein. 8. Elkington said that, in view of what I had said, it was clear that the Company must rule the last three islands out of their calculations altogether, and make no attempt to include them in the 100,000 square miles. As regards Parur, on the .other hand, the Company would clearly he in order in including it in their area if they decided that it was worth including. There seemed to he some doubt, however, over Sirri and Nahiya Parur, and he asked what I thought the Company should do. 9. I said that, speaking offhand and entirely personally, I thought that, if these islands were sufficiently ''interesting 1 ', from the oil point of view, to he worth including in the 100,000 square miles, the Company should include them and have done with it and, what was more, include them without making any reference to their doubtful ownership. This seemed to me unquestionably the right line in the case of Nahiya Parur, hut I also felt prett confident that it was the right line in the case of Sirri too. If this island was ''interesting 51 and the Company did not take it, the Persians would he free to include it in a concession to some other company, xDSsihly and indeed proT^hly a non-British company. It was moot unlikely chat, ij. that happened, His Majesty's Government would in the upshot he ahle to take any effective action to stop them, and the re-sult would oe that/that His hajesty's G-overrmient would have the worst of all worlds. If the Company followed the course which I had suggested; the , result might he to reduce yet further such small bargaining value as Sirri still possessed for His Majesty's Government, and this might still he the case even if His Majesty's Government made some declaration, on having the terms of the new concession area brought to their notice, co the effect that they did not recognise Sirri as 'being under Persian sovereignty. But this was, in my opinion, a lesser evil than leaving Sirri as a possible prey to some other company and losing its bargaining value anyhow. 10. Elkington said that, in view of these explanations, the Company would now go ahead and try to form some idea as to whether the islands of Parur, ITabiya Parur and Sirri were worth including in the future concession area, and would, in the event of their deciding that Sirri was worth including, go ahead, and include it, if we agreed, without more ado. Isaid that I thought this would be all right, and undertook to find out as quickly as possible whether the views I had expressed were approved. 11. ^Hcington also explained that it was the present intention of the Company to include the whole of the Persian coast line from the Iraqi frontier to the Baluchistan frontier, for at least a short distance Inland, in the new area. They could not afford to have other companies actually on the coast. They would also in certain places have to include parts of the sea under which oil might conceivably be found, and it was for this reason that the frontier position at the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab was, or might be, of importance to them. The method they proposed to adopt in doing this was to define certain astronomically fixed points, the lines joining which would be the limits of the area. For instance, one part of the new concession area/Ill £ 5. area would pro'ba'bls 7 ' be described as 'being 'bounded on the ^outh- East oy the frontier dividing Persia from Iraq, from such and such such a point to the sea, from the point where the frontier meets the sea to an astronomical point ahcj from there to astronomical point zyz, and so forth. 12. I should 'be very grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible whether you think that any modification is needed in the views I expressed about Sirri. I have little doubt in my own mind what the company ought to do if thej^ think Sirri worth including in their area. I am less sure about what His Majesty's Government ought to do if confronted with a concession agreement between the company and the Persians including Sirri (it would make little difference whether Sirri was mentioned b. name or lumped with other islands rs being north of a certain line drawn between points in the sea). I feel we should have to say something, but we should have to try to say it without dragging the company into political questions. Perhaps we could say something to the effect that we regarded the inclusion of the island as the natural outcome of the fact that the Persians were9 as we had always recognised, in actual and effective occupation, but that we reserved our position, as before, as to its international status. 13.

The effective occupation of this island loy Persia since 1887 and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty's G-overnment (and of the Sheikh of Sharjah under protest) make it difficult, if not impossible, to dispute the longstanding Persian claim and if the island is sufficiently interesting from the oil point of view, it seems 'best, as you suggest, to let the Company include it in the 100,000 square miles v /ithout making any reference to its doubtful ownership.

My dear Gibson, I enclose a record of a conversation which I had recently v. i th representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company ah out the possible inclusion of Arahi and Parsi in the area of 100,000 square miles which the Company have to choose before the close of 1938 as the extent of their concesnion for the future, I 11 view of the recent correspondence on this subject (in which the latest letter seems to be Jarrett's to you vi,02607/38 of the '5rd June), I sujoose 'e must say that, in view of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, (or perhaps in view ol the fact that we consider Persia has at present no claim to these islands and they either belong to the Sheikh of Koweit or are res nullius and we do not want Persia to try to occupy them) the Company ought not to attempt to include either of these islands in their area (it may be the case that they are not 'interesting'' from the oil point of view in any case) . We should also have to ask the Company not to say anything about the Sheikh's claims to the Persians. 3# We should be placed in a somewhat embarrassing position vis-a-vis the Company if at any future date the Persian Government were able effectively to assert a claim to at least one of the Islands, and thereafter to give that island as part of an oil concession to some other Company than the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. In this connexion, as we have said before, we do not consider it is possible to give the Sheikh of Koweit cr anyone else a guarantee that His Majesty's Government would be able effectively to uphold his claims/N ) # 8. claims. The most we could say would 'be that we would do our heat if the case ever arose. But in view of the general consensus of opinion as to the undesiraMlity of giving these islands to anyone else than the She ilch of K owe it, we must no doubt face this possible embarrassment, 4.

Dr. Lees said that they did not know at present whether the islands were interesting from the oil point of view or not. But they would probably {in the event of their being Persian territory) wish to include them in the concession area, 3, I explained in confidence that the ownership of these islands was at present to a large extent indeterminate, but that we regarded the Sheikh of Koweit as having a good claim. We could not say that his claim was absolutely water-tight, because it might well be that any overt act of sovereignty on his part might draw the attention of other Powers to these islands and that those Powers mi^it then themselves put forward claims to sovereignty over them on various grounds. Without knowing what such grounds might be, we could not say here and now that they were bad. The outcome of such a state of affairs could not be predicted, but it was possible to imagine that it might be necessary to split the group up, one Power taking one part and another another. At any rate we were not encouraging him to assert his sovereignty at present, 4, I told Mr, Mylles that I would let him have a definite answer later. But I thought it would probably be that the islands were, to the best of our belief Koweiti and that we would not be able to recognise the right of the Persian Government to grant any concession in respect of them.

At the meeting which I had with you, Lees and Browne on the 7th September, you asked the same question about Farsi and Arabi. 3. I am now able to let you have the definite answer about all these islands which I promised you. The answer largely confirms what I said during our conversations. 4. It is as follows (a) Nabiya Tunb, Tunb and Abu Musa are, in our view, unquestionably Arab and should be iylles, Esq. , Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.1SJ- be excluded from the Company's concession area. (b) On the evidence available, Farsi and Arabi must be regarded as belonging to the Sheikh of Koweit and should likewise be excluded from the Company's area. r/e are, however, anxious to avoid entering into any controversy with the Iranian Government about these islands and it would help us if the Company could refrain from saying anything abou' the Sheikh's claims to them to the Iranians. (c) Parur is indisputably Iranian, and Little Farur, though its status has never been formally determined, must be regarded as Iranian too. There is therefore no objection to the Company including these two islands in their concession area, if they so desire. (d) Sirri1S&gt;' (d) Sirri has been in the effective occupation of the Iranians since 1887, and since the existence of this occupation has from time to time received de facto recognition from His Majesty's Government, we should not object to the Company including the island, if they wish, in their concession area without making any reference to its doubtful ownership. If the Company do include it, we shall consider whether we should at some stage make some declaration to the Persian Government which, without raising the question of status in a controversial form, will make it clear that, although acquiescing in the inclusion of the island in the Company's concession area, we reserve our position, as before, regarding its international status.

C.L, Goncessions, (All the P.C.L. Concessions except Qatar and Kalba specifically include all the islands and territorial waters belonging to the respective Sheikhs). He said that he would look into this further, 3. The status of the Islands in the Persian G-ulf is now, of course, of particular interest to us, in view of the Continental Shelf question. You will notice that while in the case of some of the Islands there are substantial grounds to support ownership by one State or another, the status of others is apparently quite undetermined. Included among those whose status is undetermined are tho following Harqus Farsi Arabi J,W,Parrell, Esq,, /Oil Ministry of Fuel and Power, 7, MiUbonk, S,W, 1,2* 1, Tan iPersia bm.

Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri. soul-1 oay lijil set &gt;1 I. —Introductory. 1. Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri are three small islands lying well out in i the Persian Gulf between the Trucial Arab coast and the Persian island of Kishm. Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island, 1 mile long by | mile wide, 8 miles to the west of Tamb, was agreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island.^' Tamb itself is an island 17 miles south of the south-west point * i o.to f . o ., Deo.a of Kishm Island and 46 miles north-west of the nearest point on the coast of llll'/fs ; 2 F.a 0 fco' Trucial Oman, roughly circular in shape, and about 2^ miles in diameter. Messrs. strick, A lighthouse was erected on it by His Majesty's Government in 1913 (see 1^2795/08. ' paras. 25 to 28 below). It is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It Lor.ii, 1908. appears probable that deposits of red oxide are to be found both in it and in •'- s Little Tamb. Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a Lor. 11,1275. tout few miles nearer to Shargah in Trucial Oman than to Lingah in Persia, with oftttl good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been s sosu' under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. Sirri, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, 'ri;: the nearest point on the Persian coast, is more prosperous and fertile Lor. ii, isso. than Tamb, and, like it. contains deposits of red oxide, though these are t Poi. Kes. to g. of apparently unimportant.f p. seo/os. 1909 ' 2. The history and status of these islands is identical. While, however, the Trucial Sheikh of Shargah on the Arab coast still controls Tamb and Abu Musa, on which he flies his flag. His Majesty's Government, and the Sheikh under protest, have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in Persian occupation of Sirri. The Persian flag was stated to have been hoisted on Little Tamb in 1904$ at the time of the Persian aggression on Tamb and j poi. Res. to a. of n * Abu Musa. It was presumably removed at ihe same time as it was removed 1., April 151904. from those islands; but the Political Resident reported in November 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on Little Tamb by the Sheikh.§ § Tel. from viceroy It is not known whether steps have since been taken to do this. ^ L ' 3. The islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as p - 2m/08 - representative of the Jowasimi Arab chiefs, one section of whom in the 18th century established themselves by force or alliance at Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia. The Persian claim to the islands has in the past been based on the fact that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, under whose administrative control they were for many years prior to 1887, had for long been Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered the islands, which had become Persian territory. The latest Persian claim is based on the fact that the islands, together with Farur, are shown as Persian in a War Office map of 1887 of which copies were presented to the Shah Teh. tel. 25^0 f.o., by the Minister at Teheran, under the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888 p. 4509/28? ' (cp. paras. 34 and 36 below). 4. The recent reassertion of the Persian claim to the island of Tamb renders necessary a more detailed examination of the history of that island, and of the islands of Abu Musa and Sirri, the status of which is identical, than would otherwise have been the case. Persian ownership of Farur does not appear to have been disputed in the past; the island is in any event in a different category from Abu Musa, Tamb and Sirri, and no reference is made to it in the present Memorandum. II.—History of the Islands prior to 1887. 5. It has proved impossible to trace any reference to the history of the islands in the 17 th and 18th centuries. From 1720 the Arabs of Ras-al- 3053 75 8.28 AKhaima on the Trucial Coast (hereafter referred to as the Jowashm; had been active on the Persian littoral of the Oult, on tvhtoh before 1/2Mhey seized Basidn, In 1737 they were attacked in tneii own teintory by Persia • Lor. i, 031-2. fnd .ppe« to have made submission,' but it does not seem that lew. ^ retaiued any hold on Ras-al-Khaima.

It seems entirely clear that no effective dominion was exercised m any of them by her between that date and the seizure of Sirri in 1887. In the intervening •period if not from a much earlier date, the islands were apparently part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs, the Sheikhs on the Arab shore having an equal interest with those on the Persian littoral. ^ Their management, administration, and jurisdiction had, however, for many ^ vears prior'to 1887 by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, viz. the Sheikh of Lingah, but m his capacity of ^ t r 01 . ^ Jowasimi Sheikh and not of Persian official!—a state of things which would ^ Minister, Teheran, t liave ar i sen from the fact that Tanil) was for a period used by ^'^Tei trom Pot Res.

Up to about 1873, owing to the close connection existing between Tamb and Lingali, the Residency authorities at Bushire took the view that Tamb was Persian, and in the period ending with 1879 several enquiries regarding it are stated to exist in the Residency records. In 1882, however, in reply to an enquiry, the Residency Agent stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, furnished the Resident with translations of letters to the Sheikh of Shargah which established the rights of the Trucial Chiets. ^ Copies of these letters were produced in another connection m 1900 by the Residency Agent, who stated that he had himself seen the originals. ^ II Tel. from Poi.

The history of these incidents is as follows. 4 j tils ^ D III.—Occupation of Sirri by Persia, 18874 X G - of I - Pr0 - ,, tiuiin ceedings, Sept. 1888. , () _ j n the year 1877 an armed Persian party, with two small cannon, was sent to erect a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirn.

J e protection in common with Arabs of the Persian littoral. The Residenti bir jied' in, at ■e ( itaen i rea uiulcullu-u- hi vvauxx xj.j.cvKyo — &lt; —' TO I 1 separately reported to the Government of India that the islands formed par ty of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs; that for many years, asim however, their management, administration and jurisdiction had by common ■ e consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh on the Persian coas , ® viz., the Sheikh of Lingah for the time being ; that the Jowasimi Sheik s u t domiciled on the Persian coast had acquired the status of subjects 0 isess Persia, and those who governed Lingah had been, in fact, Persian onicia s qua Lingah ; that the Persian claim was doubtless based on these grounds, seat and that, were it not for the fact that the Arab Sheikhs of the Oman coast cati jointly owned the islands, the Persian position could not be disputed. ^ e IB;Resident supported liis statement with the translation of a letter written in 1877 by the Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah of Lingahto the Chief of Ras-al-Khamia, in which the former ' admits that Tamb is a dependency of the Kowasim of Oman, and that the Persians have no property there nor any right to interfere, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima.' In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Persian Government had no good title to the islands in question.|| II poi. res. to g . of 11- The Sheikh of Shargah protested to the Resident on 16th October ^ Sept - 2 ' 188 '' lb87 against the Persian action at Sirri, and asked that similar action at Tamb might be prevented. The Government of India felt, however, some difficulty as to^ the action to be taken, in view of the fact that Persian Jowasimis had joint rights on Sirri and Tamb, and that one Arab Sheikh only had appealed, and it was agreed, in consultation with the Resident, that, no overt action having been taken by Persia in the case of Tamb, * Tel. from Poi.

The Governor, however, informed the Resident that ' he had no documents relating to the Persian claim, and that he had wired to the Amin-es-Sultan excusing himself from discussing the question with the Resident.'^ Enquiry + Xel from p ol Res was independently made of the Chief of Shargah as to the Amin-es-Sultan's to c.'d 'A., Teheran, statement. The Chief's reply explained the connection of the Governors r)ec ' 12 1887 ' of Lingah with the island of Sirri, and added that Tamb was uninhabited, and that no taxes had been paid to Persia. He further enclosed three letters from Chiefs of Lingah, admitting the Chief of Shargah's ownership § Poi Re S toc d'A of Tamb.§ Teheran, Feb. 12 1888 13. The Persian Government had meanwhile produced five official letters from a former Sheikh of Lingah (Yusuf-bin-Mahomad) in support of the || c. d 'A., Teheran, Persian claim to the two islands.l] The Resident,^ after examination, t0 Ees &gt; Ja 11 - 2 1888 - replied ' that he considered that the documents did not bear out the Persian Jan.^ms d ' A ' claim, and that weight should not be attached to the statements of the Sheikh in question, who was a dependant and servant of the Jowasimi Sheikh, Ali- bin-Khalifah [cp. para. 10 above], whom he murdered in order himself to become Chief of Lingah, 1 ' and, the Persian Minister appearing to rely on a L statement of Sheikh Yusuf that he had ' gone to the island of Sirri to inspect and recover Government (Persian) dues,' the Resident wrote that he considered that ' this statement could not be accepted as establishing or even supporting the Persian claim to possession, nor as sufficient to deprive the Jowasimi Arab family of their ancient and previously recognised rights on that island.' (It may be added that on 29th March 1884 Sheikh Yusuf wrote to the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima fully admitting the possession of Tamb by the Jowasimis.)§§ The Resident further pointed out that the Jowasimi §§ Poi. Res.'s Memo, Sheikhs of Lingah had usually also been Deputy-Governors of Lingah on p gss/o 1 * 95 ' behalf of Persia; they exercised authority on Sirri island, but it was Jowasimi Sheikh and not qua Persian Governor. 14. A reply on the lines of the Resident's report was sent to the Amin es-Sultan by Her Majesty's Minister on 2nd March ,1888. The Persian Government, on enquiry being made 0 ® as to the grounds on which they ** Note of Mar _ 6 had annexed Sirri, repliedtf that it was in their possession, being a isss. dependency of Lingah, to which the Legation replied that jurisdiction tt^Note of Mar. 10 over Sirri had been exercised by the Governors of Lingah solely in their capacity of Jowasimi Sheikhs, that the traditional rights over Sirri of the Jowasimi Sheikhs had never been disputed and were generally recognised, that the hoisting of the Persian flag altered the existing status, and that it was on this ground that Her Majesty's Government desired that reasons should be shown for this alteration. The note, after adding that while 'possession, if of long standing, and undisputed, undoubtedly carried considerable weight . . . the argument would scarcely govern in the present instance,' concluded by asking the Persian Government to com municate ' the proofs they possess of the former dependence of Sirri island on Persian authority.'__ \ 15 On the 28t.li April 1888 the Resident communicated to the Minister rpg^gj-r^n a copy of the translation of a leport diawn^ up locally for the Amin-es-Sultan, which he had obiained privately, relative to the Persian claims It appears that ' there was nothing fresh in this report beyond a new claim put forward to the island of Abu Musa,' which, again to quote the Resident, ' has no justification whatever.' In the summer of the same year (26th July) the Minister telegraphed to Bnshire that a reply had now been received from the Persian Government that ' as the Jowasimi Sheikhs were Persian Governors of Lingah, they considered no further proof of the justice of their claim necessary.' To this the Resident replied that the Persian reply begged the question, and that the Arab contention as regards Sirri was that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah represented the family, and derived no right from their position towards the I ersian Government. 16. In order to facilitate the disposal of other negotiations. His Majesty's Government decided in August 1888 tacitly to acquiesce in the Persian occupation of Sirri. Save, however, by such acquiescence, to which reference was made in official correspondence with Persia in 1904 (see para. 21 below), they have never in any way admitted or withdrawn their original objections to the claim of the Shah's Government to the ownership of the island, while the Political Resident stated in 1904 that it was equally clear from the Residency records that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim, wdiich they had formally reiterated in 1895, to proprietary rights over Sirri, any more than over Abu Musa and Tamb. lat ^ irnm A' ffd pro iettlentf 21. r J m itf F 0 iitweigl p Shei ||o»n by 'I worn , Persian 'lepos, 1 iiexisti: |iw flag ikr Gc Jislawfu 22.1 ifSharg. fsrsia tc P. 737/01. t F.O. to I.O., April 23 190 4 ; I.O. to F.O., May 1901, P 2559 /01 IV. Temporary Persian Occupation of Abu Musa and Tamb, 1904. 17. In January 1903 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, trade having to a large extent been diverted from Lingah as the result of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, Lingah merchants were endeavouring to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the island of Abu Musa a port of call. He added that, in view of the Sirri incident of 1887, he was apprehensive lest the result might be the advancing of a territorial claim to this island by Persia. The Resident stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah, that the Jowasimis did not, however, fly a flag on the island, and that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a sign of ownership. This course was approved and action taken accordingly. 18. The question having arisen of advising the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that time and now dependent from the Sheikh of Shargab) to adopt a similar course in regard to the island of Tamb, which belonged to the Ras-al-Khaima section of the Jowasimis, the Resident reported that, so far as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted by Persia, that the Sheikh of Shargah in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-al-Khaima claimed it as an appanage of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast, and that he was in possession of documentary evidence in the shape of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingah admitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, as against the claim of the Jowasimis of Lingah. It was decided that the Chief should be advised to hoist his flag on Tamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 19. In April 1904 the Viceroy telegraphed that the Belgian Customs officials had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags, erected new flagstaffs and hoisted the Persian flag on both islands. This action led to immediate protest by the Sheikh of Shargah, who appealed to His Majesty's Government, under his treaty relations with them, to take the necessary steps to prevent such interference in his territory. 20. The Government of India, who took a serious view r of the incident, proposed 5 * to despatch a gunboat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the Jowasimi flag and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided,! however, to give the Persian Government the opportunity to withdraw from the position they had taken up, and on the 24th May the Minister reported 23. T I Sirri w ioreram ant tb 24.

Their Note.J t Juiie 141904 ' however, stated that Persia considered ' these two islands as its property •' p - 29e4/04 - and proposed that ' neither party ' should hoist flags in them pending- settlement of the question. 21. The Note of reply sent to the Persian Government on 15th June 1904, while expressing willingness to transmit to the Government of India any proofs that the claims of Persia to the ownership of these islands outweighed those of the Sheikh of Shargah, stated that the suggestion that the Sheikh of Shargah should not be permitted to replace his flag, hauled down by the Persian Customs officials, could not be accepted, and went on : 'I would remind you, in this connection, that we have not insisted on the Persian Government removing their flag from the island of Sirri till the controversy between the two Governments as to the ownership of the island, which originated many years ago, has been reciprocally settled. The position would have been different if the Sheikh of Shargah had removed an existing flag from Tamb and Abu Musa; what he did was to hoist his own flag upon the islands, which were not yet formally occupied by any other Government, and he has the right to fly it as the first occupant until his lawful possession of these islands is disproved.' 22. The Persian flags were removed, and the Jowasimi flag of the Chief of Shargah re-hoisted in June 1904. No serious attempt was made by Persia to produce proof of Persian ownership,® and the discussion lapsed, * Lor. i, 2138. though in 1905 a complaint by Persia of the erection of new buildings at Tamb by the Sheikh of Shargah was investigated and found to be baseless.! t Teh. tel. to Poi. rrn • , Res., May 20 1905, 23. ine opportunity was taken to make it clear to Persia that the status p. 1116/05; Poi. of Sirri was still sub judice, a view in which she acquiesced, and the Persian ^ t0 Teh -&gt; J,me 1 Government were warned in 1905 that ' the revival of their claim to Tamb meant the revival of ours to Sirri.'

In October 1912, in reply to an enquiry by the Governor of the Gulf Ports, Sir Percy Cox stated J J that, with the concurrence of the Sheikh Jt Letter from Poi. of Shargah, a light was about to be erected there. His Excellency replied Oct' 13 igi'-f 1 '' that ' there was no doubt that the island properly belonged to Persia and p. 4778 /12. ' that they had to thank the blatant action of the Customs in 1904 for spoiling their case in regard thereto. I rejoined that we considered . . . that it6 was beyond doubt that the Sheikh of the Jovvasirai of Oman owned the island, and, as in dealing with the question we had to_ reckon with patent facts, it seemed waste of time for us to discuss the question no a . 27. In February 1913 the Persian Foreign Office raised the question with the Minister at Teheran, urging that the ownership of the island was contested by Persia. Sir Percy Cox, on reference being made to him, 'b* tf to min 1 feb. 23 intimated§§ that he had recently made it clear to the Governor of the Gulf i9i3, p. isi'g/is. Ports that the ownership oJ Tamb was not open to question, and added that 'since the correspondence of 1905 the subjects of the Sheikh oi bhargah and his flag have remained established on the island ; that if the question was now reopened His Majesty's Government would no doubt revive the question of Sirri; but that a flat refusal to discuss it would probably be best. 28. The matter does not appear to have been taken further by Persia. The light was exhibited at Tamb on 15th July 1913, and His Majesty's Government agreed that notification of its erection should be made to iiiyfms' 0 '' foreign consular representatives in the usual manner by the Government p. 2M7/13.' of India. 1111 VII.—Statements made by His Majesty's Government to German Government as to ownership of Abu Musa, 1907—14. 29. It may be remarked at this stage that in the lengthy negotiations which took place with the German Government between 1907 and 1914 over the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in respect of the cancellation of their red oxide concession in Abu Musa by the Sheikh of Shargah, no reference was made to the Persian Government, who were, indeed, privately reminded by the Charge d'Affaires in 1908 of the incident of 1904, and warned against any attempt to renew the Persian claim.® His Majesty's Government con sistently referred, in their communications to the German Government, to- the ' sovereignty ' exercised in Abu Musa by the Sheikh, and a quantity of local evidence was produced to show that the ownership of Abu Musa vested t Cp. e.g. Memo, to ^ ( | ie ru ]i n g Sheikh of the Jowasimi of Oman residing at Shargah. j It German ovt. un er c | ear }y j , av e been impossible for His Majesty's Government to have taken the very definite line actually taken by them vis-d-vis Germany had the status of the island been, in their view, a matter at all open to dispute. * Teh. tel. 6 to P.O.

In 1923 the Minister at Teheran reported that he had learned confidentially that the Persian concessionnaire of the Hormuz red oxide concession, Moin-ut-Tujjar, a person of great wealth and considerable political influence, was urging the Persian Government to raise the Persian claim to Abu Musa, couple it with that to Bahrein, and refer both to the League of Nations J Sir P. Loraine was instructed by the Foreign Office to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the incident of 1904, when His Majesty's Government had been prepared to take naval action to remove the Persian flag from Tamb and Abu Musa, and hint that revival of the Persian claim might lead His Majesty's Government to take the measures then contemplated. § 31. The Minister made the required communication to the Prime Minister, making, however, no reference to Tamb in his Aide Memoire. His Highness made no reply on the matter of Abu Musa.H Ten days later a Note asserting Persian rights over both Tamb and Abu Musa, ' of which notification was made to His Majesty's Legation in the year 1903-4, having been addressed to the Minister by the Persian Foreign Office, Sir P. Loraine adopted an uncompromising attitude, and returned the Note to the Prime Minister with a strongly worded covering letter.^' It seemed probable that the despatch of the Note was due to ignorance on the part of the Acting Foreign Minister of the communication which had been made to the Prime Minister, and, the position of His Majesty's Government having been made clear, the incident went no further.IX.—Persian Customs Interference at Abu Musa, 1925-6. awtumn^pf 1925 the Persian customs authorities sent a launch to Abu Musa which inspected the red oxide and removed one bag On a protest being made, they replied that Abu Musa belonged to Persia. Energetic action was taken at Teheran by His Majesty's Minister, who reminded the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1923 correspondence, and subsequently warned him privately that persistence in the Persian claim would make it necessary 'to request the Government of India to despatcli a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of ohargah. _ Ihe Persian Government withdrew, and the customs ** Teh. Desp. 258 authorities were instructed 'not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb toF -0-,M ay 3i pending reply from Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding status of these 1926 ' p - 2243/26 - islands. X.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb, 1928. o3. In July 1928 a Persian customs launch, which had been operating from lamb for about two months, seized off the south of the island a Debai dhow carrying passengers to Khassab, on the Arab coast, with a small cargo of sugar and dates, and brought it to Lingah, where the cargo was confiscated as smuggled and the passengers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial Coast, the Trucial Chiefs being restrained only with difficulty from immediate reprisals; and its possible reactions proved a matter of grave concern to the Government of India. 34. Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty's Government at Teheran secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew. The cargo remains under seizure, arid a claim for compensation has been met by a reiteration of the Persian claim to ownership of Tamb, based, according to the Acting Minister for_ Foreign Affairs, on a British Note dated 27th July 1888, signed by His Majesty's Minister under instructions from the Marquess Teh. tel. 250 to of Salisbury, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, communicating a |- a ' An ^ 24 1928 ' map 'recently issued by the Intelligence Department of the War Office' ' 4509 ' for presentation to the Shah on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The Charge d'Affaires has indicated that the argument is unsubstantial, while the fact cannot clearly in itself affect the validity of the Arab claim ; but it is clear that in the forthcoming negotiations with Persia, not only the immediate Tamb incident, on which the Government of India have expressed themselves very strongly, but the position of Abu Musa (and of Sirri) will come up for disposal. XI.—Summary. 35. The effective occupation of Sirri by Persia since 1887, and the tacit acquiescence in that occupation of His Majesty's Government, make it difficult, if not impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though His Majesty's Government are not estopped by any formal admission on their part from using the Shargah claim to the island for bargaining purposes. 36. The position is different as regards Tamb and Abu Musa. At no stage has the Persian claim been formally admitted, and at no stage has it been allowed to pass unquestioned. The argument in support of the latest Persian claim as set out in para. 34 above could be strengthened, so far as it has any value, by reference to the fact that the islands are also shown in Persian colours on Lord Curzon's (unofficial) Map of Persia of 1892, and on the Survey of India Map of 1897.® While, however, the error in question is extremely regrettable from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government, it cannot be taken as a formal declaration by His Majesty's Government of their view of the status of the islands, nor, it is suggested, can it be regarded as of substantial importance in view of the consistent repudiation, before •and after the dates mentioned, of the Persian claim. * Teh. tel. to Viceroy, April 20 1904, P. 2559/04.8 37. As regards the merits of that claiixi, tlie historical summary above- shows that the history of the islands prior to 1750 is obscure; that since that date such authority and such effective occupation as there has been has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who between 1750 and 1820 exercised in the Gulf a maritime control uncontested by Persia. There is nothing to show that those Arabs, having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived authority over outlying islands. Probability suggests, rather that they carried with them to their new settlement a position in the islands which they already possessed, liie fact that a section ot! these Artih intruders later accpured the status of Peisian subjectg^- and held their authority on the Persian coast in subordination to the Persian Government Pol. Res. to Minister, as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the Jowasimi Teheran, Dec. is tribes on the Arab and the tTowasimi tribes on the 1 ersian littoial may have 1898 - had i n common; an intimate connection appears to have been maintained between the two sections of the tribe, and the islands remained their common property and did not become Persian territory ; nor, the islands being held by a Sheikh only on behalf of the tribes, had an individual power to alienate t Viceroy to s. of s. any sovereign territorial rights which he might enjoy qua ruler of these fori., Feb. i61908, tribes.t Finally. de facto possession resting with the Jowasimi Arabs of the p. 864/08 Trucial Coast, it would appear to be for Persia, in the absence of evidence at any stage of effective Persian occupation or of acknowledgment by the Trucial Arabs of Persian overlordship in the islands, to prove the case for alteration of the status quo. 38. As between His Majesty's Government and the Trucial Chiefs concerned, the latter, under their treaty engagements, are entitled to the protection of His Majesty's Government and are not themselves allowed to communicate or negotiate direct with any foreign Power. Apart from the fact that their claim to the islands has consistently been upheld by His Majesty's Government, it was on the initiative of His Majesty's Government that the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima hoisted his flag on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1903 (see paras. 17 and 18 above). 39. The satisfactory disposal of the matter is important in view of its- immediate reactions on the Trucial Coast, and the wider reactions on Mohammedan feeling in India of disturbance in that region. But its- importance from its possible reactions on the relations of the Trucial Chiefs, with Ibn Saud is hardly less great. d . G. L. I ndia O ffice, 24th August 1928.

The present IS'ote, accordingly, deals with the following groups of islands:— (a) Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el- Maradin, which lie oft' the coast of Koweit and the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. (h) Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Sheikh Shuaib, Haiderabi, Kais, Farur (and Little or Kabiyu Farur), which lie off the south Persian coast, and the position of which came under discussion before and during the war. (c) The Bahrein Archipelago. (d) Balul, Dalrnah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. A.—Bubiyan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el-Maradin. These islands were before the war in Turkish possession. They were attributed to the administrative control of the Sheikh of Koweit in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, and were occupied by the Sheikh on the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914. They were formally recognised by His Majesty's Government as forming part of His Excellency's dominions in /Vpril 1923 (see Koweit Memorandum, para. 35, o^ page lijjj). No Persian claim to these islands can reasonably be preferred. B. —Sheikh Shuaib, Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Hinderabi, Kais, Farur, Nabiyu or Little Farur. The status of Henjam is examined in greater detail in 'paras. 5 and 6 of the Memorandum on Henjam on p. With the exception of Nabiyu or Little Farur, these islands appear to be indisputably Persian; and in 1914 His Majesty's Government made a formal offer to the Persian Government to lease or purchase all except Hinderabi, Kais, and Farur. j' In 1918, when t Teh. Desp.to P.O., the renewal of this offer was under consideration, the addition of the three p .^ oks / iI ' 4 ' last-named islands to the lists to be communicated to Persia was approved.^ jf.o. tel. 137 to Teheran. Mar. 8 Nabiyu Faeur. ms, p. 1024/18. The status of Nabiyu or Little Farur is not formally determined. The island, which is uninhabited, and lies about 10 miles south-west of the southern extremity of Farur Island, is circular in shape and about half a mile in diameter. The Persian Government were stated in 190G§ 'as yet 'to §Lor. ii, 584. have paid no attention to it; the Government of India and the India Office in 1908 expressed the view |i that, on the analogy of Little Tamb, it should be regarded as depending from Farur, 'which admittedly belonged to Persia,' i?o. to px)'., dec. 2 and the Foreign Office did not dissent from this view. iocs, p. 2111. The question was again raised in 1924 in connection with a proposal to erect a light on the island. The Political Resident then suggested that the precedent of Little Tamb was not necessarily binding on Plis Majesty's Government, adding; 'We have precise facts that Nabiyu Farur is a barren rock, useless, and not claimed by anyone, and that in 1875 the Farur Sudanis 3063 75 10.28were recognised as belonging to the Jowfisim Iribe of irucial Oman.' No reference to the incident of 1875 could be traced by the India Office ; but i .o. to f . o ., Mar. 26 the Secretary of State for India agreed with the Government of India that it 1924, p. 839/24. be undesirable to start the erection of a lighthouse on the island without prior intimation to Persia, and the matter was not pursued. It would appear therefore that there is little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, though a slight element of doubt as to a Jowasimi claim exists. C.—The Bahrein Archipelago. The archipelago consists of the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na'assan, Sitrah, and Nabi Salih, and a number of lesser islets and rocks forming part of the same compact geographical group. The archipelago is under the rule of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and the status of Bahrein governs the status of all the other islands composing it, D.—Farsi, Arab!, Harqus; Halul, Dalmah, Shura-awah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. The status of these islands is important, not merely because of the claims which may be urged to them by the Trucial Chiefs, to. whom His Majesty's Government are under treaty obligations, but because their control is in many cases of importance in connection with the policing of the pearl banks, for which responsibility has been assumed by His Majesty's Government, and because of the possible value of certain of them in connection with an air route along the north Arabian coast. F arsi , A rab: and H arqus. Farsi is an uninhabited island about a quarter mile across, in the middle of the Gulf, about halfway between Musallamiyah Bay in Hasa and the Tangistan district in south Persia. Arabi is 15 miles south of Farsi; and Harqus, 'a mere sandbank,' 30 miles west of it. Oil seepages were alleged in 1914 (Engler's ' Petroleum ') to exist in the sea near all three islands, and Arabi carries a deposit of guano. Lor. n, 115,553,642. 'j 1 ]^ ownership of all three islands was stated in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer to be undetermined, Mr. Lorimer adding in the cases of Arabi and Harqus that the question had never arisen. The India Otfice in 1914 mlt* p 3&lt;)46 0ot 20 ex P ressecl Llie view* which the Foreign Office did not contest, that His Majesty's Government should eventually claim the right to deal with all three islands (as with Halul); and beacons were at the same time erected t Tel. from s. of s. on them with the concurrence of Admiralty and Foreign Office.! No steps were, however, in fact ever taken to regularise the status of the islands, which geographically would most easily have been assigned to Koweit. H alul. An island^ 1 mile in diameter, some 61 miles E.N.E. of Dohak in the Trucial Inncipality of F1 Katr, surrounded by pearl banks, and having in its neighbourhood, under the sea, an intermittent spring of bitumen.J In 1906 there were rumours, which proved unfounded, of German designs to acquire the island from the Porte for use as a coaling station, for which purpose the Government of India stated that it was not unsuitable. Lorimer's Political Gazetteer (1906) described the status of the island as ' indeterminate; the pearl divers and fishermen both of El Katr and of Iiucial Oman are in the habit of resorting to it; and, so far as can be leaint, no exclusive or preferential rights are claimed by any of the classes who use it, or by any territorial Chief.'§ In 1908 the India Office, after consultation with the Viceroy, suggested to the Foreign Office that it was pieferable to take no action which might lead to discussion of the status of the island, as any assertion of rights beyond the present customary usage ■ • Arabs from Bahrein, the Trucial Coast and El Katr, might lead to claims being raised by the El Katr Sheikhs to which the Turkish II lo. to f.o. Dec. 2 Governm ent [suzerain of Katr till 1916, since when the Sheikh has been 1908, p. 2111. recognised as an independent Trucial Chief] might lend their support.']! for I. to Viceroy, Dec. 15 1914, P. 4600. t Lor. ii, 617. Lor. ii, 618.In 191 o bii 1 eicy Oox, then Political Resident, reported the discovery of correspondence of 1869 from which it appeared that, one of the Shatt-al- Arab buoys having gone adrift and been thrown up on Halul Island, reference was made apparently as a matter of course to the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as overlord of the island* and in 1914 His Majesty's * Pol. Ee S . to G. of Government authorised! the erection of a beacon on Halul for political as distinct from navigational reasons, and, to quote the Resident, with a view to t Tel. to Viceroy ' enabling us to keep a footing there as a political precaution.' (Cp. para. 10 Mar - 41914 ' P ' 8 ' 34 - of Memorandum on Lighting and Buoying on p. JjJJ.) As in the case of Farsi, Arabi and Harqus, the India Office in 1914 recommended that His Majesty's Government should eventually claim the right to deal with Halul,but no steps were in fact taken for the regularisation j i.o. to r.o. of its status. This accoidingly lemams indeterminate, the available evidence '^ 0 ^' ^ appearing to point to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as the owner, or failing him P ' 3946 ' one of the other Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast, including the Sheikh of El Kali.

An island 5 miles long and 2| miles wide, off the coast of the Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi, close to several pearl banks, and of importance in the pearling season.

I regret information supplied in para 2 of my telegram has been proved incorrect. 4, Erection of light on Farsi Island is of considerable importance from navigational point of view owing to number of tankers now visiting Kuwait Oil Company f s loading terminal at Fahahil and I consider work should if possible be proceeded with in spite of Saudi Arabian Government's claim. 5, As we have recognised the Shaikh of Kuwait's claim to the island by asking for his consent to the erection of the light beacon we should continue to support it until the Saudi Arabian Government can satisfy us that they have a better claim. 6. The communication which I have suggested should be made to the Saudi Arabian Government in para 3 of my telegram might be amended by reading 'is being substituted' for 'has recently been substituted'. 7, I am informing H.M's Minister Jedda that I am consulting H.ia.G. before replying to his telegram No.6 April 12th. - HAY - ' Copy sent to P.A.Kuwait under P.L.No.811-S dated 2/5/47.33/15 &amp; 14/172 Telegram From To No,375.

It might be worth considering suggesting to the A.P.O.C that they shd at any rate have the place looked at. The Khuzistan could so easily pass 'by it to look at the Birds Or the place might 'be examined 'by a mica firm, 7, But in both cases there would probably be rival claims to the island which might be embarrassing, I cannot at present make up my mind,as to Mwrther It is best to take some action while the field is clear, or whether to hope that the sleeping dog will contin^ue to lie.

The reports and correspondence are mainly between the India Office, London; the Foreign Office, London; Political Resident Persian Gulf, Political Agent Kuwait; Political Agent Bahrain; the Anglo Persian Oil Company. The discussion over the territorial status bears on whether the islands would come in the concession area of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or Kuwait. One letter notes that if the ownership of the islands is undetermined up until that point this was of no importance; however, with the possibility that they may contain oil it was now imperative that they should belong to either Her Majesty's Government or to Kuwait rather than a foreign power. Therefore, the Shaikh of Kuwait is encouraged to erect beacons on some of the islands to support his claim to ownership. As the British were keen to avoid territorial disputes with Persia this was thought more unobtrusive than the raising of flags. There is also discussion over the island of Hawar and whether it belonged to Bahrain or Qatar.It also includes a translation of a letter from Shaikh Hamdan bin Zayed [Shaikh of Abu Dhabi] to Colonel Stuart Geoge Knox, Political Resident Persian Gulf, a small hand drawn sketch map showing location of a village on Dalma Island with H.M.S.
