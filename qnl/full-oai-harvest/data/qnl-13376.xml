Some additional image sequencing in pencil (e.g. a–d per image on each page) has been crossed out.Process:Albumen printsBinding:The album is bound in green and brown half leather format, which is heavily scuffed along the spine, particularly at the upper spine. The binding also features linen joints and hand-stitching. A now-detached twisted blue string may have served as a page marker.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Genre/Subject Matter:The album contains landscape and architectural views of locations in India, the Persian Gulf, Burma, Florence, China (Yarkand in the latter-day Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region), Zanzibar, the Andaman Islands, Balochistan, Scotland as well as group and individual portraits of indigenous groups, colonial administrators and families of colonial administrators. A number of non-photographic elements are also to be found in the album, including four ink and watercolour drawings, and several printed images. The prints are lightly mounted on the page, the majority captioned. They date from the 1860s‒1890s.The album forms part of the collection of Sir James Robert Dunlop Smith (1858‒1921), a British official in the Indian Army, but there are strong indications that it was compiled by Sir Charles Umpherston Aitchison (1832‒96), Chief Commissioner of the British Crown Colony of Burma (1878‒80) and, later Lieutenant Governor of Punjab (1882‒87), whose daughter Beatrice Clementina married Dunlop Smith.Elements:1) High Court Calcutta2) The Strand Calcutta3) Lall Dighi &amp; Post Office, Calcutta4) Eden Gardens Calcutta5) The Maidan &amp; Government House, Calcutta6) United Service Club, Calcutta7) The Outram Statue, Calcutta8) The Cathedral Calcutta9) The Post Office, Calcutta10) Lall Dighi &amp; Post Office, Calcutta11) Looshais ‒ Captn Lewin12) Looshais13) Raja of Sikkim and suite ‒ Lt: Govr. of Bengal and suite [Darjeeling] Sir George Campbell14) Lt: Govr. of Bengal and suite with Raja of Sikkim and followers [Darjeeling] Sir George Campbell15) Lord Mayor's Tomb16) The Mall, Simla, in Winter.
