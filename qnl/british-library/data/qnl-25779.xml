( 2 ) I95&amp; % PTIUBRnW to ^ f0 The American Ambassador His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and, with reference to thin Embaeey*n note No. 1246 of September 18, 1939, has the honor to transcribe below the text of a telegram received from the American Embassy at Berlin under date of September 22nd, 6 p.nu , through the American Embassy at Brussels: An official or the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed a ?nember of thivS KmbaBsy that the treatment of Gorman nationaln including consular officers in Egypt 7 hich the Germans consider had been provoked by British intervention near the Egyptian authorities had brought about internment of certain 22ritish subjects in Germany* Previously there had beon no German intention to intern British subjects in this country but upon receipt from Bgypt of word regarding action taken by the Egyptian authorities against Genian nationals the attitude of the German officials had changed. The official read excerpts from a memorandum regarding acts committed in Egypt against German citizens stating that the German Legation at Cairo had been surrounded by police and that German citizens attempting to enter the premises had been arrested to the number of about ninety,. Of these only seventeen were still under detention but this number included two German consular officers who had been imprisoned or interned. Moreover the premises of the Deutsche Bank in Cairo had been invaded and the employees arrested and similar actions had taken place in the German Archaeological Institute. 'RECo.POL.Dfi^P# -1 OCT 1939 INDIA OF FICE | rman building had oeen damaged but German citizens /hadF r i. - had not been hadly treated during their confinement* The official eaid that treatment similar to that accorded German citissene in Egypt had according to information received from Iraq occurred in that country although neither the Iraq people nor Government had been interested in peculiar ree trictionr on German cltisene or their property. Somewhat similar word ha*S been received from the Straits Settlements and India. The fficial then inquired if it might be possible for the Srltieh Government to give assurances that all German citi*en» in the Britieh Empire might be allowed to depart on or after a specified day and if it ?ould receive guarantees that they would not be hindered from returning to Germany &gt;r aone neutral country contiguous to Germany. The official said that if ooue date ^ero not fixed the question of - tv, wa$» to make the initial move toward repatriating the citizens of the other prrty might drag on indefinitely and accordingly it was important that a definite day should &gt;e determined for the departure of the eitlsene of Germany in British territory and for the departure of British subject© from German territory. The Germans wished assurance© not only that German© in the United Kingdom would be allowed to depart but that Germane in Kgypt, Iraq, India, the Straits Settlements and other parts of the British Empire would also be allowed to regain their countrv without hindrance. The official added that If the British authorities in individual cares could give special reasons for refusing to a11o 1 a giv^n German to depart from their territory ©uch action ^ould not endanger the plan for the repatriation of the nationals of the re© active countries but inti ire fed that a proposal for an exchange of German© for an equal number of British woul meet *ith op osition. /xB. 8f. 40/39 © i'7 ity Bept€Aber 9 1^39 ith inference to your letter Ho.
