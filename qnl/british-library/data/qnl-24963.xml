The latter, however, though willing to accept this division in the case of wireless, insist that the cable rate should be such as to give them 60 centimes a word as their share. This led them to suggest that the total rate should be 120 centimes by cable - and therefore by wireless since the rates must be the same (see Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No.31409 of October 21st); but the Persians continue to insist that the total rate should be 60 . I have spoken to Mr. Labouchere who says that in matters of this kind we have in practice to accept the view of Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless. (Although there is a Treasury ruling empowering H.M.G-. to coerce the Company, any such coercion would give the latter a right to compensation). The Foreign Office and the Tehran Legation are therefore simply a post office between the Company and the Persian Government, and the deadlock will have to continue until one side gives way. From paragraph 5 of his telegram No.T/202f. of April 2nd (which paragraph dealt with the rates for the wireless service) it may perhaps be inferred that the Political Resident considered the Company justified in fyg'g'gpting 60 centimes a word as their share of the cable rate. Since then neither he nor the Government of India have shown any interest in this question, although the subsequent correspondence has been repeated to them. In these circumstances perhaps we might agree with what Mr. Labouchere proposes?4^ DRAFT LETTER G-a P# Labouchere, Esq# , Foreign Office,, S.W.l.

I have discussed the question^ of the fates between Bushire and Bahrein with Cable and Wireless Limited. As you know the Persian Government is insisting on a fifty-fifty division of the rate whether by cable or by wireless and this results in the suggested * total being as high as 120 centimes. Of this sum the Persian Government would be getting 60 centimes a word on cable traffic without performing any service. In.order to maintain the rate structure in the Persian Gulf area, Cable and Wireless Limited feel they cannot depart from the figure of 60 centimes per word as their proportion; the total rate will therefore be 60 centimes plus whatever 'terminal” the Persian Government decide to levy. tlJL P ikoJh fit mU ol Yours sincerely, 'WE (Signed) L'.H.

As we understand the position, flA there are two distinct though related questions to.be considered;(a) whether the Persian telegraph oilices are now, contrary to their previous practice,accepting telegrams for transmission to Bahrein, and whether this is resulting in a speedier and cheaper service than before. (b) whether the new wireless service which the Persians have introduced between Bushire and Bahrein is necessary to the re establishment of satisfactory communications in the Gulfj and what rates should be changed on this service, V,e at the India Office are interested in (a) chiefly from the point of view of improving the means of communication between in the Political authorities Bahrein and Bushire; and paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Political Resident’s telegram No . T/204 indicate that the desired improvement has now been obtained. 7;e are also interested in the question whether the Persians are accepting telegrams for Bahrein from the general public, since the Government of India and the Political Resident have both gomMsntod that the’ re-establishment of direct communication should apply to all messages and not merely to Government telegrams.propose, however, to awe it further info met ion on this point. 4.

Bullard(«•)/ though Tehran telegram to the Government of India Bo. 42,where the matter was first mentioned, does not refer to any previous correspondence. We have consulted the Political Resident on the views of Gable end Wireless, as st-ted in your letter under reference, that this new circuit cannot be regarded as essential to the communications system in the Gulf, and that it will not improve on the speed of the other available channels of communication. Prom the yTu/w second paragraph of m**- let'.er to Callender of February 18th, however, it appears that the Company do not object/1 mi' object to this circuit being used when the cables are temporarily interrupted, provided that it charges the same rates as the cab’el# route. The Political Resident seems to be broadly in agreement with these views, and you will see that he has already suggested (subject to the views of the Government of India) that Sir R. Bullard should ask the Persian Government to instruct the Bushire telegraph office to use the cable exclusively (he evidently means 'to use only the cable') for telegraphic communication with Bahrein, and to resort to communication by wireless only if the cable again breaks down, he feel that, if the F.G. agree, they might telegraph to. Tehran approving this suggestion. Their telegram might also authorise Sir R. Bullard, with reference to his telegram to India No e 42, to tell the Persians that we should prefer that the rates charged by them for communications by the wireless/v;ireless service should 'be the same as the existing cable rates; and further that these rates will be charged by Cable and Wireless at Bahrein even if the Persians^charge a lower rate at their end. V.'e should wish the F.O. telegram to be repeated to the Government of India, who would be asked to signify their agreement before the proposed communication to the Persians was made. 5. We should be glad if you would let us know, after any further c&lt;/w with Cable and Wireless which you may consider necessary, whether you agree with what is proposed above. 6.

From the last paragraph of the letter from Humphrey, the Karachi Manager of Cable and Wireless, of which a copy is enclosed in Fowle’s Express Letter, it appears that Humphrey thinks that representations are being made to the Iranian Government about this question. No suggestion for representations has been made by the Political Resident himself. Indeed it is difficult to see on what ground they could be based, for Article 27 of the International Telecommunication Convention appears to give the Iranian Government the right to suspend communication with Bahrein if they want to do so. Nor do I think there would be any chance of representations meeting with success. I would therefore deprecate any representations on the subject, in spite of the inconvenience and expense which must, I suppose result from the Iranian Government’s decision. Would you let me know in due course whether you agree that we should take no action? 3 . H.L. Baggallay Esquire The Foreign Office.• SSMIk* 3.

Sir, I am directed to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of information regarding wireless stations of the Koweit Oil Company Limited at Koweit and Bahrah forwarded with your letter No. 44250/36 dated the 30th December 1936, and to say that this Department has no definite information as regards the terms on which the Company has been permitted to erect and operate these stations. I am therefore to refer to the correspondence ending with the India Office letter No. E. &amp; 0. 8026/36 dated the 8th December 1936 and to request that, if His Majesty’s Postmaster-General has no objection, full details together with a copy of any specific authority which may have been issued may kindly be forwarded for the information of this Department. 2. In this connection I am to refer also to the wireless stations at Gwadar, Sharjah, Bahrein and Bushire. It is understood that the stations at Gwadar and Sharjah are operated by Messrs. Imperial Airways Limited while those at Bahrein and Bushire are operated by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, the latter stations having been taken over by the Company with the assets of the late Indo/Indo European Telegraph Department. Definite information of the terms on which these Companies have heen permitted to operate these stations is also not available in this Department and, before addressing the Companies, I am to enquire whether the British Post Office have issued any formal authority or could supply any information on this subject. 3. I am also to say that similar information is also required in respect of the station recently proposed by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Aden for which callsign XZY was allotted by this Department. Although, as explained by the fndia Office, the position in respect of this station will change from 1st April 1937, it appears that the station should be regarded as authorised by this Department for such period as it continues to use callsigns allotted from the Indian series. In this connection I should refer you to this office endorsement No,W-4371 dated the 20th January 1937 forwarding a notification to the International Bureau that the callsign will be changed from XZY to VTQ from 1st April 1937 and to enquire whether it is proposed to allot a callsign to this station from the British series on the transfer of Aden from Indian control.

The conditions under which such stations are established and operated are laid down by the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India. A copy of your letter has therefore been sent to the Secretary of State for India. A wireless call sign from the British Colonial series is now being allotted to Aden.

[52 of 25th May, 1932, tranamitting a copy of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concerning wireless communication in the Gulf, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations for the consideration of the secretary of state for India in Council. 2. The existing w/T stations in the Gulf can be grouped as follows (a) British operated stations in Persian territory - COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL. (d) Persian stations in Persia operated in connection with Imperial Airways and other air services - (b) British operated stations in Iraq, territory - BASRAH RADIO fc) British operated station in Arabian territory - BAHREIN RADIO BU SHIRS JASK fNote ; - The station at GWADCJR (India) is also used in connection with air services). The Under-Secretary of State, MB INDIA OE1TCE.2 3. None of the above W/T Stations is concerned with Admiralty or Commander-in-Chief, East indies 1 commimications to and from the Persian Gulf Division, since these communications are already ensured by the Naval W/T Stations at IvIATARA (Ceylon) and Aden. Eor quick: local communication within the Persian Gulf between political Officers and H.M. Ships, and for commercial services to and from merchant ships, certain W/T stations in the Gulf are essential. 4. In the event of a forced abandonment of Bushire and Eenjam W/T Stations, intercommunication by W/T between Basrah, Bahrein, and Karachi could not be guaranteed with the existing apparatus at Bahrein, and political officers in Persia might find themselves unable to communicate direct with H.M. Ships in the Southern portion of the Gulf. As far as My Lords are aware, however, it is incorrect to state, as does the Political Resident in paragraph 2 of his letter, th^fc Persia has asked H.M. Government to move the 'Naval Base' altogether from Hen jam. This statement is presumably based on the remark in the despatch of 17/2/32 from H.M. Minister at Tehran that the Persian Minister of Court has 'asked whether it would not be possible to induce H.M. Government.....c? 3. A Pr - 3 !» 7 M^ 3A foa CNa^v.

It is unfortunate that the political Hesident and the Government of India should have prematurely accepted that the position is that we have been definitely asked to evacuate Henjam, and My Lords would suggest that their misconception should be corrected. 5. A project which My Lords understand has recently been discussed with Imperial and international Gommunica- tions Ltd. at an interdepartmental Meeting is that the power of Bahrein W/T station should be increased so as to enable it to maintain communication with Karachi and Basrah and with an air base at Sharjah. This proposal would also ensure that the installation would be capable of communicate irgwith H.M. Ships in any part of the Gulf. Political Officers in Persia would thus be in touch with H.M. Ships in the Gulf by cable to Basrah and thence by W/T to Bahrein and H.M. Ships. This plan would be considerably cheaper than the establishment of an additional W/T station of adequate power on the Arabian littoral near Debai as x proposed by the India Office in 1928, though it might place certain restrictions on ship to shore communication of merchant ships in the southern portion of the Gulf. The......./ The W/T post at Sharjah will not affect the need for increased power at Bahrein in the event of Henjam closing down. The station at Sharjah is purely an R.A.F. post manned only when aircraft are in flight. 6. My Lords suggest that the following arrangements would best meet the situation:- (i) An increase in the power of Bahrein so as to enable that station to be received on medium frequency (500 kc/s) by any ship or shore W/T station within the Persian Gulf during day light and dark hours. (ii) The installation of a suitable H/F transmitter at Bahrein to enable intercommunication to be carried out with Karachi for at least 12 hours out of 24. 7. My Lords desire, however, to point out that the maintenance of a British operated W/T station at Henjam is most desirable from both commercial and naval points of view. 8.

The station will be required to keep continuous watch on 900 metres during the time when an aircraft operating on the England-India route is in the air between Basra and Shargah - i.e. for about 4 or 5 hours before arrival at and after departure from Bahrein on two days a week at the present time; the R.A.

He said that commercial trafiic at the station was small and that there would be no difficulty in providing the continuous watch on 9C0 metres nor in according priority of treatment to aircraft messages. He undertook to submit proposals for providing the facilities required by the Air Ministry in connection with the air service by means of (a) simplex working; and (b) duplex working with remote control. He will communicate with Wing Cdr. Lywood in the event of the company wanting any further particulars of the departments requirements.f i * Pov (Xa- tNA^. riA . -? « v«a~ Uvoy/f^ m , ^*-1 k~*eA. .

T / 5 ’ / t*U. 1 ^ vJfc • Mr.Dibdin and I attended a meeting at the Air ^ ^ ifinistry on 24th June to consider the question of the provision of wireless facilities at Bahrein. There were present representatives of the Foreign Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry (Operations Division), Director of Civil Aviation aaad Imperial Airways* (~t (-C-/Lh4. A preliminary meeting took place between the representatives of the Departments, Imperial Airways representative also being present, to discuss our precise requirements at Bahrein and the tactics to be adopted with the Communications Company. The discussion as t 0 the type of facilities required was of a technical nature. Broadly speaking the position appears to be that two alternatives are as follows:- The first - to establish what is known as a ’’remote control” station. It would be possible to keep an all-day watch for air messages without in any way interfering with ordinary commercial working. The second - modernisation and strengthening of the existing Bahrein wireless. tAA -tAA U\ UmA- . (rt u^s^/U/xU Ua C(Z- cL At/***/ , It appeared that the establishment of a remote control station, while it would produce much more sat i s f act ory/n satisfactory results, would involve considerable expense, and that the modernisation of the existing apparatus so as to make the station capable of communicating with Basra, the projected wireless station at Shargah and with Karachi, would probably suffice, but that we should try in the first place to get as much as we could from the Communications Company. As regards the tactics to be adopted with the Company, the India Office representatives pointed out that the Political Resident had represented as recently as 1930 that there was considerable commerciaJL traffic during the pearling season. In addition there was now a distinct probability that oil would be found in paying quantities in Bahrein. Finally the existence of the air route would itself produce a certain amount of traffic. In these circumstances modernisation of the Bahrein apparatus was probably a good commercial proposition from the point of view of the Company, and if that was so there was no reason why Government should meet the whole of the expenditure involved. The Communications Company 1 s representative\took the line that commercial traffic (owing to the temporary slump in the pearl trade) was not at present of much importance, he had no information as to the discovery/discovery of oil. He indicated that the existing apparatus was of very inferior quality, and added that the Company at present had a staff of three who were insufficiently employed and for whom they would he glad to find more work. Further there were at Bahrein good permanent quarters, while there w T as an excellent public power supply. At the same time he doubted ifftEe Company would see their way to taking up(^he provision of additional facilities. He promised to consider and submit proposals with an estimate of cost in respect of (a) remote control station, (b) modernisation of the existing station. to work and building and working a new station themselves was bound to turn on the nature of the financial proposals which the Government might decide to make to He was warned that H.M.G. ! s decision as between them.It iis requested that in any further communi cation on thin subject the under-mentioned letter afyd number may be quoted, and the reply iaddrenned to — INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department.

I have the honour to invite a reference to tne correspondence ending Mith telegram i;io.4070 of the 27tn Jecember 1930 from the Secretary of ctate for Inaia, re^ardin^ wireless communication in the Persian Gulf. 2. The position is that if and when the Treaty negotia tions with Persia are concluded the ushire wireless station will be dismantled and the material handed over to the Persians, while the Persians on their part have in the course of the negotiations endeavoured to restrict the use ,ol the (v Henjam station to communicating with liis .Majesty's ohips. Latterly, as the Government of ^ndia are aware, the Pereiaho v have gone further and have asked us to move the navyl base altogether from Henjam, and in this case they would presumably demand the removal of the wireless station as well. In either eventuality i.e. if the iienjam wireless was removed or only permitted to * communicate with His Majesty's Ships, the Bahrain wireless will, when the Bushire station is closed down, be left entirely in the air. 3 . . •.I was ^iven to understand some time a^o that steps were bexn^ taicen to increase the power of the Bahrain station so that xt could communicate regularly with Karachi and Basrah.

The first definite projjosal for the use of wireless telegraphy in the Persian Gulf was made by the Political Resident, Bushire, in April 1908, 0 * p. 1297 /os. when he proposed that Koweit and Bahrein should be linked up with Bushire. The reasons advanced were— (1) to give telegraphic facilities to the Political Agents of the Government of India recently (1904) appointed to Bahrein and Koweit; (2) to facilitate the quarantine service of the Gulf; (3) to assist the operations against the traffic in smuggled arms; and (4) last, but not least, to assist our seaborne trade in the Gulf in its struggle against the active competition of foreign Powers. The Secretary of State for India, for financial reasons, was not prepared at that time to take the proposal into practical consideration, while, apart from this, the question was bound up with a scheme then under consideration for the erection of wireless stations for strategic purposes along the coast of India. 2. It was soon after decided that a temporary wireless station should be erected at Jask to assist the operations for the suppression of the arms traffic. This station was opened on 24th December 1909 and, since it had been erected within the ground of the Telegraph concession there, it was not considered necessary to make any communication concerning it to the p. 3(&gt;:t7/n&gt; Persian Government. 3. In August 1909 Messrs. Wonckhaus’s agent at Bahrein reported that his company were anxious to establish wireless telegraph communication between Bushire and Bahrein,! and it was agreed between the India Office and the + P 3942 / 0 ^ Foreign Office that to forestall such a project the British scheme for wireless stations in the Persian Gulf should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible It was proposed that the cost of the scheme should be shared between the British and Indian Exchequers, and the Treasury agreed to this in principle. P. 4076/09. Erection of Present Stations: 1915-1917. PW 171 */// 4- a Despatch, No. 96, dated 24th August 1911, the Government of #4ndiaT sub miffed definite proposals, with estimates of the cost, for the I establishment of wireless stations at Bushire, Henjam, Bahrein, Koweit and Pwftry/ ( or Z° ra )&gt; with a portable station to be erected at Lingah when ' w ' j required. This scheme was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India '*Mn his telegram of 20th February 1912. The station at Bushire was completed on 30th January 1915, that at Bahrein on 7th June 1916, and that at Henjam on the 10th October 1916. No station was erected at Debai or Zora. Work on the station at Koweit was commenced and the buildings yrere erected, but no wireless apparatus was installed as it was decided in 1916 to connect Koweit with the Mesopotamia telegraph system by erecting a land line to Zubair. 5. It was decidedf that no communications should be made to the Persian t 1, w - 1036/12 Government regarding the erection of the stations at Ilenjam and Bushire. The station at Henjam was situated in the Telegraph concession there, and, as in the case of Jask, no notification to Persia was therefore deemed necessary. The case was different at Bushire, where there is no concession and the telegraph buildings are only hired. There had, however, been in operation there a small wireless installation erected by the Navy, to which no exception had been taken or question raised by the local authorities who made free use of it themselves, and it was decided that should the Governor of the Gulf Ports raise any question with regard to the permanent station and refer the matter to the Persian Government the explanation to be given was that improvements were being made in the existing installation in order to give better facilities in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. 2979e 75 10.28 1 US’ l V* P.1584/22, P. 3037/22, P. 3639/22. t P. 3899/22. + P. 861/25. § P. 3945/25. i| Teli. tele, to F.O. 200, Oct. 27 1927, E. &amp; O. 8632/27.

During the war a proposal was made to erect land lines from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, Jask, and Lingah respectively. The line to Kerman was erected, but it was decided not to erect the line to Jask and, in substitution of the land line to Lingah, to erect a temporary wireless station there. The wireless station at Lingah was opened on 2nd October 1917 and no communication concerning it was made to the Persian Government. Persian Requests for Removal of Stations: 1922. 7. In April 1922 the Persian Government asked for the removal of the wireless stations at Bushire, llenjam and Lingah.His Majesty’s Govern ment considered it of importance that these stations should be retained in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the Minister at Teheran was accordingly authorised! to offer to the Persian Government one-third of the charge of CO centimes a word levied on wireless messages on the understanding that the Persian Government agreed to the retention of the stations in the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Persian Government did not press their request for the removal of the stations and His Majesty’s Minister therefore had no occasion to submit the offer which he had been authorised to make.! 'The Persian Government desired to raise the question of the status of the stations at the International Telegraph Conference held in Paris in 1925, but could not do so because the Conference was not competent to deal with such questions,§ nor was the question raised at the International Radiotelegraph Conference at Washington in 1927. Persian Prohibition of Import of Wireless Spare Parts: 1927. 8. In October 1927 the Persian Government prohibited the import into Persia of wireless telegraph or telephone apparatus, ; but before the prohi bition became effective a supply of spare parts was furnished to each station, and it is estimated that unless some accident occurs the stations can continue to function at least till the middle of 1929. 9. In November 1927 Sir R. Clive reported that the Russian Government had agreed to recognise the wireless station at Enzeli on the Caspian, with its plant and building, as the property of the Persian Government, on the understanding that they should be allowed its free use for a period of three years (extendible to five if at the end of three years no wireless station has been established by Persia), subject to certain provisos in regard to the free transmission of Persian Government messages, and to the restriction that the station should be used solely for the purposes of shipping. The Minister thought it unlikely that His Majesty’s Government would succeed in improving on these terms in the case of the Gulf stations. Desiderata of His Majesty’s Government. 10. In view of the opening early in 1928 of general negotiations with Persia, and the possibility that the Persian Government might take the opportunity again to raise the question of the future of the wireless stations, discussion took place between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office as to the line to be followed in this event. It was agreed that the Minister at Teheran should be authorised, if negotiations became necessary, in the first instance to propose that the three stations at Bushire, Henjam and Lingah should become the property of Persia but should be leased to the Indo-European Telegraph Department until 1st January 1945, the date on which the concessions of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment generally are due to expire, and that rent should be remitted in liquidation of the capital debt. It was recognised that there was little likelihood of these terms being acceptable to Persia, and the Minister was accordingly authorised, failing their acceptance, to make the best terms he could, provided that he did not, without further reference home, accept Jess than the free use of the Henjam station, without any restriction similar to that imposed on the Russians at Enzeli as to its employment solely for the purposes of shipping, for at least five years. The Persian Government have not so far raised the question, and no discussions have taken place. 11. In a Despatchto the Government of India of 28th April 1928, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has pointed out that the question of the efficient retention of the wireless stations at Bushire, Henjam and3 Lingah has become acute since the Persian Government has refused to allow the importation of spare parts for repairs. Sir L. Haworth states that the retention of one station only in Persia, preferably that at Henjam, failing which Bushire, in conjunction with the station at Bahrein (also controlled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and, unlike the other stations in the Gulf, run at a profit;, is necessary for shipping work. He suggests that the probable desire of Persia to maintain stations at Bushire and Lingah might afford good ground for bargaining for the retention of Henjam. Should Persia prove obdurate, the needs of shipping might, he considers, be met by the erection of a station on the southern coast, probably near Ras-al-Khaimah—the existing cable between Jask and Bushire, if deflected to Ras-al-Khaimah en route, would provide immediate contact between Bahrein and Bushire via Ras-al-Khaimah—in which case no Government wireless station would be necessary in Persia at all. (The Lr. from Pol. Res. possibility of using the island of Abu Musa (the Trucial ownership of which s '’ is, however, challenged by Persia) has also separately been suggested by the i\ 4482. Resident.) But a decision on the question depends, he remarks, on the final decision arrived at with regard to the action and policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf, and especially on the agreement which His Majesty’s Minister succeeds in making on behalf of Imperial Airways, who would presumably erect their own short-range stations on whatever route they select. Summary. 12. The position may be summarised as follows :— (1) His Majesty’s Government have no legal claim to any of the existing wireless stations on Persian territory (Lingah, Jask, Henjam, Bushire). In no case was Persian agreement secured to their erection. The station at Bahrein is not on Persian territory. (2) Bahrein alone is at present run at a profit. The arguments for maintaining the remaining stations, even at a loss, and keeping them in British hands are firstly, efficiency (their value to shipping is substantial) and secondly, prestige. (3) The stations on Persian soil have approximately one year’s supply of spare parts, &amp;c. The importation of further supplies has been prohibited by Persia (though it is not very clear how strictly the prohibition is being enforced) and failing withdrawal of this prohibition the stations will be forced to close through starvation in a very short period. (4) If an agreement can be reached between Persia and Imperial Airways it will make a difference, since Imperial Airways will presumably erect their own short-range stations on whatever route they select. But on this point it will be seen from the note on Air Communications in the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government at present take the attitude that they will not agree to an international route along the Persian Gidf, and that they will insist on a clause being put in their agreement with Imperial Airways to the effect that when the three years, for which they have agreed to allow them to operate in that area, have passed, the route can in no circumstances be renewed. Unless the Persian Government modify their attitude, the making of an agreement by Imperial Airways is therefore unlikely to enure permanently to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government, so far as wireless is concerned. (5) The minimum requirement of His Majesty’s Government would appear to be one station, to work in conjunction with the station at Bahrein, and in communication with ships at sea, situated either— (a) On the Persian littoral of the Gulf, in which case it should preferably be on the island of Henjam, or, failing that, Bushire; (b) On the Arabian littoral, in which case it would probably either be in Muscat territory, or near Ras-al-Khaimah, at which point the existing Jask-Bushire cable could be so deflected as to provide immediate contact between Bahrein and Bushire via Ras-al-Khaimah.
