These were sent between the Political Agents in Bahrain and Kuwait, the Residency Agent in Sharjah, merchants and rulers of the Gulf. The sender would raise a case to the recipient and ask for his help mostly in mediating between the sender and another person. Most of the raised cases relate to starting up debt recovery proceedings for sums of money as little as 4 rupees and as much as 7,000 rupees, in 1928 to 1931. The claimants are merchants, sailors and others living in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar or Trucial Coast. Claimantsâ€™ letters are mainly in Arabic and occasionally in Persian.The main correspondence is between the Residency Agent in Sharjah, the Political Agent in Bahrain, the Political Agency in Kuwait, and Gulf Rulers.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000e3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000e3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000e3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
