Sir, I am directed hy Secretary Sir John Simon to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad has received from the Iraqi Government a request to be furnished with a copy of a Foreign Office confidential memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference, regarding ”the utilisation of the waters H of a river flowing through two States’*, of which a casual mention was made in the recently published book by Sir John Tilley and Mr. Gaselee entitled **The Foreign Office”. 2. I am to state that, in so far as this department is concerned, the memorandum would appear to contain nothing which it would be undesirable for the Iraqi Government to see, and it is therefore proposed to communicate a copy to them, at the same time taking the precaution of stating that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom can neither guarantee the correctness of the views set out in the memorandum, which was only intended for the private guidance of British officials, nor that their own views on the subject will remain unaltered. 3. It is also proposed to inform the Iraqi Government that, while they will he at liberty to make use of the information contained in the memorandum, COPY SENT BY AIR MAIC His OPY SENT BY AIR MAIL Q f y- £ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.

POL DEPT. 1 OAPR 1934 INDIA OFFICE -His Majesty* s Government will 'be grateful if, in the event of their discussing the question with any other foreign government, they will make no official reference to ohe memorandum as such, nor quote the views stated therein as being the official views of His Majesty*s Government. 4. Before, however, taking the action proposed above, Sir John Simon will appreciate any observations which Sir Samuel Hoare may wish to offer on the subject, since, apart from the possibility of matters of this kind having a bearing on the Persian Gulf, it is believed that extremely controversial questions have arisen in India, and particularly in regard to the native States, concerning the rights of States situated on the upper waters of a river to utilise or divert those waters to the detriment of States situated on the lower reaches of the river. I am Sir Your obedient Servant'/315~(o [This Document is the Property of His B ritannic EGYPT AND SUDAN. CONFIDENTIAL. Majesty ’ s GovCf nnjeyt. j y [August 1 K91 Secti &gt;n 3.19 3 4 J 2335/1992/16 j No. 1. Memorandum respecting the Utilisation of the Waters of a River flowing through two States. ACCORDING to international law no State is allowed to alter the natural conditions of its own territory to the disadvantage of the natural conditions of the territory of a neighbouring State. From this rule, Oppenheim argues that “ a State is not only forbidden to stop or to divert the flow of a river which runs from its own to a neighbouring State, but likewise to make such use of the water of the river as either causes danger to the neighbouring State or prevents it from making proper use of the flow of the river on its part.' He goes on to point out, however, that there are neither customary nor conventional detailed rules of international law on this matter, and that such restrictions as have been recognised appear to be the result of treaty stipulations. (Oppenheim, “International Law,” 3rd Ed., § 178a.) On the other hand, Fenwick, an American writer, remarks : “ It is doubtful whether inter national law can be said to have recognised any servitude corresponding to that existing in civil and common law in the form of a right to the uninterrupted flow of streams and rivers. Conscious of the possession of the traditional rights of sovereignty, States in possession of the upper waters of a river have not recognised any general obligation to refrain from diverting its waters and thereby deny to the States in possession of the lower waters the benefits of its full flow.' (Fenwick, “ International Law, ' p. 267.) 2. The legal aspect of this question appears then to be vague and undefined, unlike the question of the navigability of international rivers, which is governed by principles sanctioned by international law and by a regime laid down in the peace treaties of 1919, and in the general convention and statute on this subject signed at Barcelona on the 20th April, 1921. 3. In this connection it is of interest to note the discussion held at their meeting in Madrid, 1911, by the Institute of International Law, at which certain rules were adopted regarding the utilisation of the waters of international rivers. These rules are preceded by an “expose des motifs ’ (which was not submitted to the vote of the institute), in which it is stated :— “Le droit international s’etant deja occupe du droit de navigation quant aux fleuves internationaux, Fexploitation de beau a Fusage de I’industrie, de Fagriculture, &amp;c., est restee en dehors des previsions de ce droit. “II parait done opportun de combler cette lacune en constatant les regies de droit qui decoulent de Finterdependance incontestablement existant entre Etats riverains du meme cours d’eau et entre Etats dont les territoires sont traverses par le meme cours d’eau.' Hter dealing with the case where a river forms the boundary between two States, he institute laid down seven rules in the case of a river traversing in succession the srritories of two or more States, which may be quoted in full. “ 1 Le point oil ce cours d’eau traverse les frontieres des deux Etats, soit naturellement, soit depuis un temps immemorial, ne peut pas etre change par les etablissements de Fun des Etats sans 1 assentiment de 1 autre. “2. Toute alteration nuisible de Feau, tout deversement de matieres nuisibles (provenant de fabriques, &amp;c.), est interdit. “3 II ne peut etre preleve par les etablissements (specialement les usmes nour Fexploitation des forces hydrauliques) une quantite d eau telle que la constitution autrement dit le caractere utilisable ou le caractere essentiel du “'i son arrivee sur le territoire d’aval, s’en trouve gravement modifie “4.

The United States Attorney-General advise , however (Moore, “International Law,” vol. 1, p. 654), that the rules of international law imposed upon the United States no duty to deny to its inhabitants the use of the water of that part of the Rio Grande lying wholly within the United States, although such use resulted in reducing the volume of water in the river below the point where it ceased to be entirely within the United States, the supposition of the existence of such a duty being inconsistent with the sovereign jurisdiction of the United States over the national domain. The dispute was terminated by the treaty of 1896, one of the articles providing that the United States, in entering into the treaty, did not concede, expressly or by implication, any legal basis for any claims heretofore asserted, nor concede the establishment of any general principle by the conclusion of the treaty, the understanding of both parties being that the action of the United States was prompted only by consideration of international comity. 7. A controversy has also arisen between the United States and Canadian Governments regarding the diversion of water from Lake Michigan to the Chicago Drainage Canal. In December 1901 the United States Federal authorities authorised a diversion of 4,167 cubic feet per second, and this w^as the authorised amount at the time of the treaty of the 11th January, 1909, between Great Britain and the United States relating to boundary waters between Canada and the United States. In article 3 of the treaty it was agreed that in addition to the diversions heretofore permitted no further diversions of boundary waters on either side of the line ahectino- the natural level or flow of boundary waters on the other side should be made except by authority of the United States or the Dominion of Canada and with the approval of a joint commission. The Canadian Government complained in 1913 that the authorised amount of 4,167 cubic feet was being exceeded in practice and while relying on treaty rights, they refused to admit that, apart from treaty stipulations the United States authorities had the right under the recognised principles of inter’ national law to divert from Lake Michigan by any means or for any purpose such ™ amount of water as prejudicially to affect the navigation of boundarv waters in which both Canada and the United States were vitally interested Ao-ain in • V addressed by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Washington to the United r mte ment in 1926 on this question, it was stated that the” Dominion Governmet b^HeU H to be a recognised principle of international law that unless by joint consem no .permanent diversion should be permitted to another watershed from am, Zf U ? naturally tributary to the waters forming the bound-irv heiwoon tv ' ' aters hed In their reply the United States Govern^nrstated St ftTlel 7’° C0Untries - admit the conclusions as to the legal status of the withdrawal of wU P I epar ® d to Michigan, but that they did not consider it necessary to enter iLo a discussio^of3 dispute does not yet*appear to haw be^n an-ived at A Sal ' Stactory settl ement of the •s flowi^a«oitrdtries Pr ° ViSi0nS “ treatleS deali ^ Wlth P-ticular rivers cases of In the Anglo-Italian Protocol of the 15th Anril • i influence m East Africa the Italian 91 ’ deiinm g spheres of ( tthe Atbara in view of irrigation any work whfk 1C 6 n enga ? 1 e , s not to construct into the Nile.

According to article 4 of the agreement of the 13th December, ;906, Is-ween Great Britain, Franee and Italy respecting Abyssinia, the three Powers undertake .to concert together to safeguard, inter alia, the interests of Great Britain and Egydrt in the Nile Basin, more especially as regards the regulation of the waters of thatt river ^ n d its tributaries (due consideration being paid to local interests), without prejudice to Italian interests in Ethiopia as regards Eritrea and Somaliland. . 9 - As regards provisions in the peace treaties of 1919, and in certain inter national conventions, the following may be mentioned :— Article 337 of the Treaty of Versailles (and corresponding articles in other peace treaties) provides that no riparian State may undertake works of a nature to impede navigation in the international section, unless all the riparian States (or all the States represented on the international commission, if there is one) agree that rights of irrigation, w T ater-power, fisheries and other national interests should be given priority over the requirements of navigation. In the Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of Inter national Concern of the 20th April, 1921, it is laid down that in the absence of legitimate grounds for opposition, such as, inter alia, irrigation requirements, use of water-power, a riparian State may not refuse to carry out works necessary for the improvement of navigation asked for by another riparian State. A State may, however, object on the ground of vital interests. In the * convention of the 9th December, 1923, regarding hydraulic develop ment affecting more than one State, article 1 runs :—■ ‘ c The present convention in no way affects the right belonging to each State, within the limits of international law, to carry out on its own territory any operations for the development of hydraulic power which it may consider desirable.'’ Whilst article 4 runs :— “ If a contracting State desire to carry out operations for the development of hydraulic power which might cause serious prejudice to any other contracting State, the States concerned shall enter into negotiations with a view to t e conclusion of agreements which will allow such operations to be executed. 10 From the point of view of law, therefore, it appears open to doubt whether , claim can be'advancecl that a Siam ha, no right lo ntili.» the «PI»r - = of ■ ™r r„ h Gt i , r trn£^ Tb.»» and from treaty provisions appears to L ^ , interested. This principle is matter for settlement by agreement be ^ween ^ ^ ^ development of hydraulic clearly embodied m the convention o tQ out operations which might power, where it provides that a Stat d ^ ou i d enter into negotiations cause serious prejudice to any othei contract p with the latter for the conclusion of agreements.
