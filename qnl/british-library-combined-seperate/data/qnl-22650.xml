It also explains that the Resident's lack of knowledge on the tribe's recent history has hampered his ability to act on the matter, but that since he is now better informed, he is now willing to intercede on the tribe's behalf.Enclosed with the letter is a draft of a communication sent by the Resident to Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat. The letter explains that the British Government wishes to see the people of the Beni boo Ali tribe restored to the state they were in prior to Captain Thomas Perronet Thompson's expedition against them in 1820. It further explains that the British Government does not consider the tribe to be a threat the either the Imam, or the peace of the Persian Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054362.0x000036#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
