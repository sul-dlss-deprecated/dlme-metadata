CONFIDENTIAL. [E 7604/549/25] Sir R. Bullard to November 21, 1939. no Section 2. t xx * T' Copy No. Viscount Halifax.—(Received November 21.) My Lord, Jedda, October 29, 1939. AS I informed your Lordship in Jedda telegram No . 135 , dated the 16th October, Ibn Sand showed great satisfaction at the statement which I made to him on the lines laid down in Foreign Office telegram No. 14 0. The statement was read out in Arabic, and at the request of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin a copy of the Arabic was given to him. A copy of the English original is attached. I included the opinion of His Majesty's Government that the letter purporting to have been written by the Amir Abdullah to Sheikh Kamil-al-Qassab, if genuine, was unw ise and discourteous, but thought it well to keep in reserve the phrase ‘ ‘ and they will, if necessary, convey their views to the Amir.’' 2. The essence of Ibn Saud's reply is given in the second paragraph of my above-mentioned telegram. The King said emphatically that he did not want anything—Syria, Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq or any other territory—outside his own dominions, but he feared lest the addition of Syria either to Iraq or Transjordan should facilitate Hashimite designs against the Hejaz or even Nejd. The King compared his own policy (with apologies for comparing small things with great) with what he conceived to be the policy of His Majesty's Government in Europe; Great Britain wanted a balance of power in Europe, and he wanted a balance of power in the Arab world. So long as no Hashimite became ruler of Syria the Syrians, he said, might choose for themselves what form of govern ment they wanted—whether to remain under mandate or to have a republic, or to choose a king from outside. The will of the people ought, after all, to be taken into consideration. He himself would not wish to retain his kingdom if the people of Nejd did not wish him to do so. As for Abdullah (“ saving your presence ”), but for the support of the British Government he would not be even Amir of Transjordan for another day. 3. My impression that Ibn Saud was pleased with the statement was borne out by Sheikh Yusuf, who informed me next day that the King had said that all he wanted was to be secure in his own possessions, and had expressed satisfaction at the statement I had made to him (“ very pleased indeed ' was the expression used). I see no reason to modify the opinion wffiich I gave in my telegram Jslo. 140, that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned it would be better not to a^d anytKmg'to the statement made to Ibn Saud on the 13th October, but to re-examine the question if either side should continue to push its claims. It would appear from reports from His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Trans jordan that the Amir Abdullah has given up any hopes of the Syrian throne that he may have had, while Ibn Saud has renounced any claim to it so long as it is not given to a Hashimite. 4. A copy of the secret despatch on the subject of the letter to Qassab and the Bludan pamphlets, which was addressed by His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan to the Colonial Office on the 29th September, under No. TC/58/39, reached jedda in time for me to receive a telegram from Jedda on the subject before I left Riyadh, and I spoke to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin about the matter. I said that the High Commissioner considered that the Amir Abdullah had had nothing to do with the Bludan pamphlets. As to the letter, I said that not only did the Amir admit he had written it, but he claimed to have written several others to Qassab, and to have written them knowing that Qassab was one of the chief supporters of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz in Syria, and that they wx&gt;uld infallibly be communicated to him. Sheikh Yusuf was a little taken aback at this, and I thought it w T ell to say that vffiile the letter w^as unwise and discourteous, as His Majesty’s Government had said, Qassab was perhaps something of an [755 x—2]2 agent 'provocateur in carrying on the correspondence and communicating it to another party. Eventually JSheikh Yusuf admitted that had Qassab been an ordinary person his action would have been improper, but he maintained that as Qassab had formerly been in Saudi employ as Director of Education, he was only doing his duty in transmitting the correspondence to the King. Anyhow, said Sheikh Yusuf, His Majesty’s Government said the letter was unwise and ^ discourteous; what were they going to do? I pointed to the general assurance at the end of the statement which I had made on the 13th October, and when Sheikh Yusuf pressed for mention of some specific action I said I thought that His Majesty, as a ruler himself, would realise that His Majesty’s Government might not find it convenient to say exactly what action they would take with another ruler in such circumstances. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin left that point and said that Ibn Sand was in a difficulty in that the Amir Abdullah, whom the King could easily deal with had the Amir stood alone, had attacked the King from under the aegis of the King’s friends, the British Government. I said that His Majesty’s Government had specifically recognised their responsibility in the statement which I had made. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin then said that they were convinced that the Bludan pamphlets must have been prepared with the know ledge of the Amir Abdullah : he repeated that the pamphlets were conveyed to Bludan by Fuad-al-Khatib, and suggested that Fuad-al-Khatib even arranged for the printing at the press in Damascus to which the pamphlets had been traced. I said it seemed to me that if the Amir had been behind the pamphlets he would have chosen a less prominent emissary than Fuad-al-Khatib, and I made light of Sheikh Yusuf’s argument that the Amir’s complicity was established by a similarity between the tenor of the Qassab letter and that of the pamphlets. The tenor of the pamphlets, I argued, was common form ; every attempt to stir up a revolution, or internal political discontent, used the argument that someone was enjoying someone else’s money. I should have liked to add that the pamphlets might have been written by a Syrian, since they mentioned only the Nejdis as blood-suckers, whereas the Hejazi classes Nejdis and Syrians together in this respect, and has no more use for the greedy and corrupt Syrian Director of Works than for his Nejdi chief, the Minister of Finance. The following day Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that he had conveyed to the King what I had said; the King had listened attentively, but had made no comment. I am certain that Ibn Saud would do more justice than Sheikh Yusuf to my argument that Qassab was asking for trouble. At any rate, when I saw the King a few minutes afterwards, for my final interview, he was as cordial as ever. Indeed, it was then that he made the statement which I have recorded in another despatch, that when he heard of the sinking of the British battleship he felt as though a son of his had been drowned. 5. Since my return to Jedda I have received a copy of the telegram, No. 373, which the High Commissioner at Jerusalem addressed to the Colonial Office on the 21st October. I at once telegraphed instructing Mr. Wall to inform Ibn Saud of the Amir Abdullah’s personal assurance that he had no knowledge of the pamphlets until the British Resident brought them to his notice. 6. I notice from the High Commissioner’s telegram just quoted that his Excellency is inclined to believe that the relations between the Amir Abdullah and Ibn Saud are definitely improving, and that he cites in evidence the exchange of telegrams about the accident to the Amir Saud and the beginning of Ramadan. I should perhaps share the views of Sir Harold MacMichael, had not Ibn Saud stated the contrary opinion on this point. In the course of the conversation on the 13th October the King said that, superficially, relations with the Amir Abdullah were friendly: the moment the Amir heard of the accident to the Amir Saud he sent a telegram of condolence; he always did that sort of thing, but it made no difference to his real sentiments and aims. Abdullah’s fine words, in fact, butter no parsnips with Ibn Saud. The King probably regards it as inevitable that the Amir Abdullah should resent the loss of the Hejaz to the Hashimites, and should cherish a feeling of revenge for the personal humiliation he suffered when the Hejazi force he nominally led was annihilated by the Wahabis and he himself escaped in his shirt. Moreover, Ibn Saud must feel that his iown rule over the Hejaz is not popular. On one occasion during my visit he spoke with contempt of the Hejazis, and I noticed that when he claimed to be ruling with the consent of the people of Nejd he said nothing about the peopleJ. I 3 of the Hejaz. The Hejazi s are a scurvy lot, who will judge any ruler by the amount of money he lets them mahFouf~df~the pilgrimage; and as Ibn Saud takes most of the profits of the pilgrimage himself he is bound to be unpopular in the Hejaz. 7. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin referred one day to Hashimite intrigues from Iraq ^n the days of King Faisal. Faisal, he said, was an intriguer beside whom Abdullah was a child. Abdullah left written evidence against himself all over the place; Faisal never committed himself in writing, but he never ceased to intrigue against Ibn Saud, and the King knew all about it and had never forgotten it. The King has frequently mentioned to me his suspicions of Iraq, though never the alleged intrigues of the late King Faisal. His suspicions attach to living Iraqis, especially Nuri Said, and what with the attitude of Iraq towards Koweit a few months ago, and to Nuri’s conduct at various occasions in the matter of Palestine, these suspicions are not unreasonable. On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that there is any foundation for the suspicions of the Iraq Government referred to in the fourth paragraph of Foreign Office telegram No. 138 of 6th October, that Ibn Saud has designs against the Iraq dynasty, unless his recent counter-propaganda about the throne of Syria affords ground for such suspicion. It is believed that Ibn Saud enjoys among the tribal elements of Iraq a personal reputation which the Bagdadi politician or official cannot hope to equal, and that doubtless tends to awaken jealousy, and from jealousy to suspicion is a short step. But according to the telegram from the High Com missioner at Jerusalem, No. 373, of the 21st October, even the Amir Abdullah is now convinced from the reports received from Bedouin visitors to Transjordan that Ibn Saud has no hostile intentions against him. If that is a genuine con viction there is some hope for better relations with Transjordan, if only what the High Commissioner calls the Amir’s almost childish indiscretions can be kept in check, and that may perhaps improve the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. . . _ „ 8. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine, His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut. I have, &amp;c. R. \V. BULLARD. Enclosure. Statement made to Ibn Saud at Riyadh by His Majesty s Minister on October 13, 1939. HIS Majesty’s Government have learned with regret that propaganda directed against His Majesty still continues, e.g., the circulars posted from Bludan to persons in the Hejaz. Ihey note that this was mentioned to the Fiench Minister at Jedda and trust that such activities will cease. As to the letter alleged to have been written by the Amir Abdullah, His Majesty’s Government await a report from the High Commissioner. They agree that, if the letter is genuine, it was unwise and discourteous. ... His Majesty’s Government view with great concern the growing ill-feeling between His Majesty and the Hashimite family. On this subject they wish to speak with complete frankness. . They feel that this ill-feeling might be exacerbated by the question ol the throne of Syria. In June they stated their belief that the idea had not got beyond the stage of a vague proposal and, although they have not asked the French Government, they believe'that is still true. They feel sure that the French Government have not reached the stage of seriously considering the suitability of any particular candidate or even the stage of making up their minds to convert Syria into a monarchy. In any case they feel sure that, if anyone was chosen King of Syria, he would remain under French tutelage for many years. His Majesty’s Government know of no ground on which the Amir Abdullah could possibly suppose that he is likely to be chosen for the throne by the FrenchGovernment. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government hope that His Majesty will accept their advice not to worry himself further about a question which, so far as they know, has no reality. As to a certain statement which was made by the French Minister, His Majesty’s Government wish to state emphatically that they have never expressed^ any views as to the suitability or unsuitability of His Highness the Amii Faisc or of any other possible candidate*. Finally, His Majesty’s Government feel that His Majesty s long friendship for His Majesty’s Government will enable him to realise that they entirely disapprove of attacks upon his dignity and will always do their best to stop such attacks.fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be — — ■■ ——————— kept under Lock and Key.] ^ vios.-^ogy/sg).

(33/28/39) Bagdad, 14th October, 1939 My Lord With reference to my telegram No, 382 of October 13th I have the honour to offer the following further observations on the proposals discussed in Your Lordship’s telegrams Nos, 2. Prom the point of view of Iraq I feel obliged strongly to deprecate the proposed initiative for it seems to me to be rash to run the risk of drawing upo- A ourselves the fire of the Arabs in Iraq, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and proably also Syria, in a matter which primarily concerns the French Government and the Arab States themselves. If Ibn Saud does not wish to see a Hashimite ruler set up in Syria he should surely make his own representations in Paris and no doub-*; Fuad Hamza is doing this now. To unite the Arabs with us is one thing, but to risk uniting them against us quite another, and I do not see what adequate British interest would be served by the course of action outlined in Your Lordship’s telegram No, 139 of October 7th to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. ;/ e should certainly not seek to pursue a Machiavellian policy of stirring up trouble between Iraq and Saudi Arabia but unless these rivalries are carried to excessive lengths (of which I see no present sign in Iraq), a certain anxiety on the part of Iraq as to the friendliness•., ie Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, G,C,S,I•, G.C,1.E., etc., etc,, etco 138 &gt; 139 and 149 to His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddafriendliness of her neighbours is likely to make her more, rather than less, friendly to ourselves. I foresee, moreover, that the elements unfriendly to us in Iraq would he stimulated by the proposed action to become more hostile and that at the same time they would be provided with powerful ammunition with which to attack us. They would no doubt say that our advice to the French revealed the perfidy of our alaim to be the friend of Iraq and of the Arabs, that we were deliberately perpetuating the disunity of the Arabs by introducing a King from an outside family and that the fact that we haddbne this openly was a pretty clear indication that behind the scenes we had been encouraging, if not inspiring, the French policy of splitting up Syria in order to turn it into a French colony, just as we intended to keep Palestine a British colony. 3. The elements friendly to us in Iraq, including the Regent and Nuri pasha, probably understand that however sincere our goodwill we cannot favour Iraq as compared with Transjordan and Saudi Arabia for the Throne of Syria, but that we should openly oppose the claims of all these states would almost certainly be a grave disappointment and might well seem to our friends in Iraq like a slap in the face. Therefore even if the action proposed were to diminish for a time the present suspicion and distrust which exists between these states, a postulate which is open to doubt, this result would only be achieved at the cost of producing unfriendly feelings towards ourselves on the part at least of Iraq, if not also of Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria, whiJ-e/while surely the French might also resent so open an intervention in their affairs. May it not also he assumed that the French, without any advice from us, are unlikely to appoint a Hashimite candidate, for fear of making Iraq and Transjordan more active as a base for Syrian disaffection than they believe them to be already* 4. Finally, there is the future. How can we foretell what we may find politic after the war? If Saudi Arabia were to disintegrate, and a policy of federation for Palestine and Syria to become practicable and desirable we might one day think that a member of the Hashimite family was after all the most likely person to promote this policy on lines agreeable to ourselves and the French,, 5. I appreciate the reasons for which His Majesty’s Minister at jedda may feel it desirable to make some statement to King Abdul Aziz on the subject of his growing anxiety about the position of the Hashimite family in Arabian affairs, but I feel that it would be well that His Majesty’s Government should steer as clear as possible of all this intrigue which is so typical of ’Arab Unity.’ 6. So far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned it would seem to be enough that an oral communication should be made to Ibn Saud on the lines of your Lordship’s telegram to Sir Reader Bullard No. 140 of October 6th, but I would suggest that the references to the willingness of His Majesty’s Government to use their influence to put a stop to propaganda directed against him should be made more emphatic, for it appears from Mr. Trott’s despatches that the propaganda/S.J ! propaganda may have irritated l'bn Saud quite as much as stories of the Amir Abdulla’s ambition to sit upon the Throne of Syria. 7, I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s A^basssador at Cairo, to His Majesty’s Minister at jedda and to His Majesty’s High commissioner for Palestine, I have, etc. (Signed) Basil Newton.- SECRE'.

These Foreign Office telegrams, and Mr. Trott f s letter No.l33(P.Z. 6574/39 merit detailed examination. Mr.Trott’s lettei* with its observations on increased Saudi resentment of propaganda against the Saudi regime in the Hejaz, which, they suspect is organised by the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, and fears of a Hashimite becoming King of Syria, is offset by Sir B.Newton*s telegram of August 26th which mentions Iraqi fears of Saudi aggression, fears which Sir R.Bullard discounts. The Foreign Office telegrams make it clear that on the larger issue of the rivalry of the two royal families. His Majesty’s Government intend to do/do all that lies in their power to compose the quarrel. On the specific question of the Syrian throne, however, which seems to he exciting considerable ill-feeling at the moment, it seems impossible for His Majesty’s Government to take any action without bitterly offending one of the parties. The Foreign Office feel that British interests would be best served by the throne going to a suitable Egyptian candidate, but this end is hard to compass. A French declaration that the question of the Syrian monarchy will not arise for the duration of the war might help to ease the tension on this point at least. No direct action seems open to His Majesty’s Government except to reassure Ibn Saud,as Sir R. Bullard has been instructed to do, that they deplore anti-Saudi propaganda and will check it wherever possible. It may be observed that the depth of Saudi-Hashimite animosity is one of the strongest obstacles in the way of any scheme of Arab Federation. For information. S: j- Sir' fa.

Thus Ibn Baud has provided in advance reply to the statement in your telegram No. 139 which would nave to be made to him in certain circumstances. So far as Ibn Saud is concerned it would be better to adopt the alternative in paragraph 4 of your telegram No.141 and leave things as they are at present. If either party con tinued to push its claims, the matter could be reconsidered. 4.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that during the last few days several events have brought into prominence two matters which are already well Known to Your Lordship: viz. the apprehensions of the Saudi Royal family lest the throne of Syria should be given to a Hashimite candidate such as the Amir Abdullah, and the feeling, expressed on several occasions by King Abdul Aziz, that he is being subjected to organised attacks from certain elements in neighbouring Arab countries. 2. On August 16th, the I'ing T s secretary, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, brought for my inspection a postal bag containing a great number of letters addressed to prominent persons at Jedda, Mecca and Medina. Each letter was franked with Syrian stamps and postmarked at Bloudane on the 29th July. Each contained one or more copies of a printed circular headed in large type 'The Party of the Free Hejazis,' followed by the words 'The first issue' and a long manifesto appealing to the Hejazis to exert themselves to expel their Saudi rulers, who, as instruments of British Imperialism, had expelled their country’s rightful rulers and were busily engaged in sucking the country dry and oppressing it in many ways. I enclose herein the text of the manifesto with a summary translation. It appears that the Saudi authorities were vigilant enough to intercept all these circular manifestoes. The French Minister was informed about them and is understood to be taking qppropiate action with the authorities in Syria. The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G., etc. etc. etc. Sheikh/0^ Sheikh Yusuf, in drawing my attention to the seriousness of this form of propaganda, endeavoured to prove that such a document bore obvious traces of Hashimite authorship, and said that it was his firm opinion that the Amir Abdullah, for whom he expressed the greatest dislike, was the real author of the circular. I made it plain to him, however, that I personally could not see that his suspicions about the Amir Abdullah were supported by any actual evidence. 3. On the 21st. August the Quaim Kaqam of Jedda brought to me a long document which he received from the Amir Peisal.His Excellency was instructed to communicate to me the contents of a letter v/hich, he said, had been intercepted. The original was with the King. Y/hat he then read to me was a copy; it purported to be a letter from the Amir Abdullah to the well-known pan-Arab propagandist Sheikh Kamil ul Qassab, who, it will be remembered, paid a visit to His ^ajesty at Riyadh in the summer of 1937 with the object of persuading the King to intervene openly on the side of the Arabs in Palestine. A summary of the contents of the letter in translation is enclosed. It will be seen that the writer of the letter lays down certain desiderata for the good government of this country. His Majesty was evidently excessively annoyed at reading these criticisms of his system of government, and the Amir Peisal instructed the Qaim Maqara to protest to me most vigorously against the intervention which the Amir Abdullah was making in the iifernal affairs of a foreign state. I replied that all I could do was to communicate the letter and His Royal Highness T s remarks to Your Lordship, and to sed a copy to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan in case he could throw any light on the matter. I am also sending to the High Commissioner a copy of the actual/actual Arabic text of the letter said to have been sent by the Amir Abdullah, in case it may be possible for him to form an opinion on the genuineness of the letter from the Arabic style in v/hich it is composed. I am sending to Your Lordship only a summary of translation only of the Amir f s letter, as it is full of historical references, and other anfractuosities. In his letter of instructions the Amir Peisal made the point that the similarity between the expressions in the latter part of the letter and those used in the manifest© supported the Saudi theory that the Amir Abdullah was responsible for the letter. I must confess however that there is in my view no very obvious connexion between them. 4. These matters serve to illustrate and emphasise the Saudi-Hashimite feud which appears at present to be one of the main preoccupations of the King. During the recent visit of the Amir Feisal to Jecda I elicited from His Royal Highness the fact that he felt that one or two questions which had been referred to His Majesty’s Government for decision or for advice had not yet been dealt with: and when I pressed him for details he said that he was not referring to such routine questions as Kowait (though he would be very grateful to get these settled) but that he was thinking more particularly of the letter from His Majesty which had been communicated to Sir R.Bullard at Taif last June. I imagine that His Majesty’s way of looking at the matter is as follows. He feels that the Hashimites are being allowed to intrigue against him. The limits of his patience have been reached. Therefore he wants one of two things: either that His Majesty’s Government should declare their policy towards him in such a way as to ward off these attacks (which implies/ —(S' implies a hint that 'by appropriate representations to Nuri Pasha, the Amir Abdullah and others we could stop the anti-Saudi campaign if we tried): or that His Majesty’s Government should agree to give him a free hand in retaliating. But hitherto His Majesty’s Government have not dealt with the King’s dilemma. And now the campaign of anti-Saudi propaganda seems to be gaining strength. The news that Nuri Pasha blocked the ratification of two of the agreements signed at Riyadh in July, together with the constant newspaper reports that Abdullah is a most favoured candidate for the Syrian throne, have irritated His Majesty beyond measure. As an instance of recent newspaper reports I may cite the Cairo illustrated paper ”A1 Lataif al Musawara” of August 7th; on its flront page was a large picture of the Amir Abdullah headed n The new Arab King’*. That paper is popular here but I hear that the issue of August 7th. was confiscated by the postal authorities on arrival. 5. Such is, in my opinion, the King’s attitude at present, and though I see no sign of His Majesty’s relaxing his fixed policy of referring to His Majesty’s Government any question in which they are interested or in which he would like His Majesty’s Government’s advice (on the contrary I think that policy has been even more prominent than usual this summer) I am sure that the King would welcome any help which His Majesty’s Government might feel able to give him with regard to the supression of anti-Saudi propaganda by any means which may be within His Majesty’s Government’s power. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Representatives at Cairo (1908/483/49) and Bagdad (1910/483/49); to the Middle East Intelligence Centre at Cairo (1909/483/49); to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Jerusalem (1922/483/49); toV to His Majesty^ Consular Officers at Beirut (1912/483/49) and Damascus (1911/483/49). To Damascus only I am sending the original cover of some of the circulars from Bloudane, in case they may help him to trace the real origin of these pamphlets.

Ula, 1358, (25th June, 1939), to Sheikh Kamil al Qassab. (Salutations). I was very pleased to receive your letter dated at Damascus, 3rd. Jumada’l Ula, 1358* You mention that my letter has reminded you of the time when we used to talk so much together about the future of the Arab nation. You say that I am well aware that you were the first person to develop the idea of uniting the Arabs and that you put this idea before His Late Majesty more than once when you were in Mecca, begging him to communicate with the Arab Princes and offering yourself as an intermediary. The late King was not inspired to adopt the idea but, nevertheless, we are grateful to you for your efforts. (Here follows a recapitulation of the history of the Arab Revolt against the Turks; the prominent part played therein by the addressee; King Husseins attitude towards Ibn Saud, the Idrisi and British interests in Arabia at that time.) Regarding your proposal that, should the moment be opportune, we should make a general pact with the Saudi Kingdom, the Yemen and Iraq of such a nature as to guarantee the independence of these states and of Trans-Jordan, in which proposal (you say) you have no doubt that His Majesty King Ibn Saud will assist us, he being so sincere in his piety and devotion to the national cause, I thank you / warmly \warmly and declare that I am perfectly your advice on condition that you reouest His Majesty in your name and in the name of the religion and nationalism to which he is so devoted to institute general reforms in the Hejaz and Nejd hy granting a constitution such as will ensure a regular constitutional administration in the country, as in Iraq and Trans-Jordan, and will protect the peopled liberties, draw up a public budget, set up a ministry responsible to a general assembly, organise a defensive army and generally set up a proper machinery of government. In this way the pact may be a real and useful one with some possibility of permanence. The first of these conditions is the rebuilding of the Hejaz Railway line to provide a modern means of communication between these countries and also the Yemen. When you have done this I, Abdullah ibn al Hussein, will join hands with him to carry out my obligation. Time, as I have said, is short and the little that is left of our lives must not blow vainly down the wind. Peace be upon you etc (Signed) ABDULLAH.Summary of a Manifesto entitled: *» THE PARTY OP THE FREE HEJAZIS First Issue. 0 People of the Kejaz; Never in its past history did the Hejaz submit to tyranny and exploitation, on the contrary it was the Hejaz that bore the standard of conquest and led the Arabs in their great career of religious and imperial expansion. Such was the spirit of your fathers: but yours is tamer, the glorious past wouldnot recognize it. You have basely submitted to tryannous regime and given yourselves up to despair. Great Britain desires to make a colony of Arabia in general and of the Hejaz in particular, but, knowing that direct annexation is impossible, being too costly in effort and lives, she has entrusted the business to Ibn Saud. You remember with what atrocities Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz, using English arms, and finally became King in name over the land, while in fact he governed it merely as a viceroy for the British, executing their policy and submitting to their wishes. When Ibn Saud had become King of the Hejaz thanks to British gold and munitions, he assumed that it was his hereditary domain and we, its people, serfs bound to the land. He behaved like a landlord on his own estate and we became slaves and the slaves of his slaves; our wealth our livelihood, our honour lay at his mercy. Do you not see the government departments swarming with Nejdis - whose only qualification for office is that are Nejdis? Do youyou not know that a Nejdi official is paid - out of your money - many times the salary that a Hejazi of the same grade receives? Are you not aware that a Hejazi can work in the government service and never get his pay, little as it is, while a Nejdi gets an exorbitant salary and increments and bonuses - all out of the money of the Hejazis. Has no-one ever told you that it is the Hejazis who pay the taxes? that they are forbidden to move from place to place in their own country unless tney pay a tax? that, on the other hand, the Nejdis can travel about freely wherever they care? Have you never heard that the Hejazis are the milch-cow from which Ibn Saud and his men and the sons of Nejd draw their profits and when the milch-cow’s milk runs dry these tyrants will suck her blood? 0 Brothers, the days of contempt and submission and surrender are done. The real intentions of the tyrants are revealed to you. You know now the character and aims of Ibn Saud. Prepare for the approach of battle, the battle that will give you the chance to die for glory and freedom. Brothers, ’’The Free Hejazis” speak to every Hejazi who has sentiment of honour and patriotism. We ask every compatriot to prepare for the approaching day when we shall sweep away the tyranny of exploitation and write with our blood a golden line in the history of the Hejaz. Brothers in Freedom, prepare!* \X -/ [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be ret urned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] — AIjMDED distribution 6399 V ^ ^ J ^*^1 mu* — n ■ II.

At present both sides (to say nothing of rivals among the Hashimites themselves and possible Egyptian candidates) probably hope for British support, while fearing it as being given elsewhere. An effort now by His Majesty's Government to eliminate major contestants, while causing some disappointment, may .void growing suspicion and irritation and much greater disappointment and bitterness later. I do not suppose jealousies over Syrian throne are whole extent of trouble, but their elimination would at least remove const nt irritant, even though general struggle for leadership of nrabs might continue. 4. I realise th/.t distrust of Iraq and Transjordan seems more of an obsession with Ibn Baud than vice-versa , and th t from many points of view it would be more natural for a iiashimite to rule over Syria than an al-Saud. But recent reports from His majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad suggest that Iraqi Government too entertain designs against the Iraqi dynasty. strong suspicion of Saudi Attitude of both sides may cause no serious harm while Syrian throne remains in present nebulous state, but might do so if trench Government were to show signs of coming to decision. In any case His Majesty's Government cannot, ignore the loyal friendship which Ibn Saud has shorn through so many years and especially in last few months and must do their best to respect his feelings over this question.322 UP) 6305 !Q'-^O vy y 5. 5.

If communication suggested in my immediately following telegram were to be made, and question were to be raised whether His Majesty's Government's proposal included bygptian A .oyal ±amily, you could say His Majesty's Government would like to learn views of Ibn Baud. As a matter of fact if Ibn S :.ud and Hashimites saw no objection, an Eygptian Prince might be a good solution, provided one could be found who would take a course independent of King Farouk.

But greater problem is growing ill-feeling between ion Saud and Hashimite family, which His Majesty's Government view with much concern. On this subject his Hajesoy s Govt-rmeno desire to sneak with complete frankness. 4-. His Majesty’s Govern ent fear that this ill-feeling is being fanned by question of throne of Syria. They suggested in June (see my telegram Ho.99 [o ± the 25rG June] that idea had not got beyond stage of vague proposal and although they have not consulted French Government they believe this is- still true. In any case, they feci sure that lang (if any) will remain unaer French tutelage for many years. 5... •6305 2. 5* His Majesty's Govermient are, however, rapidly reaching conclusion that it will he in best interests or all concerned if King is chosen from outside leading Arab royal families. In this connexion they must in honesty state that while they would never willingly see anyone chosen for throne of Syria who was distasteful to Ibn Baud, they could equally not view with equanimity choice of an al-Saud, if this choice were dis tasteful to Amir Abdullah, for whom they have a mandatory responsibility, or royal family of Iraq, which is their ally. This does not mean (as French Minister had heard) that His Majesty’s Government have ever said that Amir Faisal would be 'unacceptable to them. On contrary, in their view, Amiir'Faisal would, in different circumstances, make an excellent candidate. G. Question is, however, for French Governmen*Uand people of Syria, not for His Majesty's Government. All His Majesty’s Govern ment could do, if Ibn Saud thought it would do good, would be to express similar views to Iraqi Government and Amir Abdullah, who must in fairness be consulted, and if all concerned agreed to suggest to French Government that they should somehow make it known:- (a) that question of Syrian throne is not actual (if this is case) and (b) that in any event French Govern .ent think it will make for future peace of Middle East if King is chosen from outside ranks of leading Arab royal families. 7. His Majesty’s Government make this suggestion the more readily because they realize that Ibn Saud does not hanker after Syrian...Syrian throne and that it is only that he is willing that one of his i 6305 I i ' out of duty juO i^SoJj^oolLs sons should accept it. His Lajesty’s Govern:lent cannot naturally foresee reaction of French Government or effect upon people of Syria of possible French c o: ip 1 iance. 8. His .'ajesty's Government hope that if question of throne could he got out of way, relations of Ihn Saud with Iraq and Transjordan would again improve. They know of no real issue which should divide these States (and incidentally whey holieve that it was not in any way General Huri‘s fault that two of agreements recently concluded at Riyadh were rejected h Iraqi Parliament). In any case they count on his long friend ship to realize that they disapprove entirely of attacks upon - his dignity and will always do their hest to stop such attacks where it lies in their power to do so. addressed to Jedda Ho.159.

No. 9 A Saving. xxxxx Bagdad telegram to Foreign Office No. 108 dated 26th August. This saving telegram did not reach me until September 24th. Outbreak of war and other recent developments e.g. departure of German Minister from Iraq and adoption of neutral attitude by Italy have affected situation. But there was never any likelihood that Ibn Saud would admit German or Italian personnel for training of his armed forces. He had difficulty enough in getting rid of Italian air mission whose presence was always displeasing to him. There is some talk here of movement of Saudi Forces towards the Iraq frontier. I may hear more about this when I go to Riyadh a few days hence. Ibn Saud may fear an Iraqi attempt on Kuwait while we are busy elsewhere. Cr he may be taking the special measures against smuggling from Kuwait which he said would be essential unless the Trade/Trade Agreement could be concluded. But I regard it as out of the question that Ibn Saud should attack Iraq. 3ven if Iraq was not in special relations with His Majesty*s Government he would hardly attack a country so much more highly developed and possessing so much more powerful forces; but that he should attack a country in special treaty relations with us would be incredible even in peace time, and can be excluded altogether as practical politics now that His Majesty’s Government and Iraq are allies in a war. It is true that if His Majesty’s Government should be completely defeated by the Germans Ibn Saud might at the last moment try to absorb some of the small States on the Persian Gulf, not from hostility to His Majesty's Government but to prevent those States from falling into hostile hands, but except for that contingency, which I trust and believe will not occur, Ibn Saud I firmly believe will not attack any territory in which we have special interests, and that is what would be involved in an attack on any member of the Hashimite family. His hostility towards the Hashimites is well known, as theirs towards him, but he has now found a safety valve in the appointment of Fuad as Minister to France, to work against Hashimite claims to the throne of Syria. I do not know whether the Prime Minister of Iraq fears the possibility of collusion between Iran and Saudi Arabia. It is my experience that Ibn Saud is highly suspicious of Iran and would be most unwilling to see her influence extended at the expense of any Arab territory. I may remind Your Lordship that although an Iranian Legation exists in Jedda it is closed except for a few weeks at the height of the pilgrim season and even then is usually in the charge of a junior secretary.

He said that two days ago he received information that Ibn Saud was concentrating and arming troops at Riyadh. He would not regard such a development with serious apprehension unless foreign (i.e. German and Italian) personnel were to be recruited to assist in the process (see in this connexion my despatch No.458). General Nuri said that for the past week the German broadcasts had been flattering and encouraging Ibn Saud. Nuri explained that he quite appreciated that Ibn Saud was friendly to Great Britain but he feared that nevertheless Ibn Saud might attack one of the Hasimite family. He alleged that two of Ibn Baud’s 'Syrian advisers' Fuad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin, were in indirect but close touch with German elements including German Minister here, Dr. Grobba through various Syrians in other places such as Iraq, Germany and Italy. Prime Minister also expressed fears of Iran's intentions towards Iraq, especially in regard to the still undelineated frontier.

My Lord, On receipt of your despatch No. 515 (E 1182/47/89), of the 14th March, a member of my staff informed the head of the Sous-Direction d f Afrique et Levant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs unofficially that reports had reached His Majesty^ Government that the question of the establishment of a Syrian monarchy was again in the air; and enquired whether the French Government had any information and what their attitude towards such a proposal would be. M* de Hauteclocque stated that this was the first he had heard of any such rumours, which surprised him, but promised to make enquiries in the matter. 2. I now have the honour to acquaint you that M. de Hauteclocque states that no such reports have reached the French Government, and that as regards their attitude the answer is the purely negative one that, so far as they are concerned, the question has never arisen at all. He added that, of course, there was no Royal or Princely House in Syria. 3. I have sent a copy of this despatch to H=\s Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo. I have, etc., (Signed) Eric Phipps.

QHiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Syria). CONFIDENTIAL. November 23, 1936. Section 2. [E 7315/195/89] Copy No. 1 31 (No. 103.) Sir, Beirut, November 17, 1936. WITH reference to my telegram No 10 of the 13th November reporting the signature on that date of the Treaty oT Friendship and Alliance between 1 ranee and the Lebanon, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the French texts of the treaty and its annexes, which form an integral part of the treaty and which comprise a military convention, five protocols, and twelve exchanges of letters. 2. The majority of the articles of the treaty and of the annexed protocols and exchanges of letters reproduce word for word the corresponding items of the Franco-Syrian treaty. I attach a table showing briefly where the main differences are to be found. 3. As in the case of Syria, the treaty is concluded for a period of twenty- five years. Similarly, the text implies that within three years of the date of its ratification the Lebanese Republic will apply for membership of the League of Nations and that France will sponsor her candidature. 4. The military convention, however, shows important differences. As for Syria, France provides a military mission for the Lebanon (the members of which may be called upon to assume command of Lebanese units) and training for Lebanese military students, in return for freedom of movement in the Lebanon for her troops. But the lower limit of the Lebanese armed forces is to be fixed at one mixed brigade, as opposed to a division of infantry and a brigade of cavalry in the case of Syria, while by article 5 of the treaty, which is explained and defined by article 5'of the military convention, France is to maintain naval, military and air units in the Lebanon for an as yet unspecified period. In this instance the helplessness and the desire for French protection, which are felt and freely admitted by most thinking Lebanese, have happily coincided with the French wish for a Levantine base for her Mediterranean forces. 5. So far as the civil provisions of the treaty are concerned, an important item is contained in Exchange of Letters No. 6 (bis), which foreshadows a unifi cation of the fiscal regime and a programme of administrative reform, comprising the grant of wider powers to municipalities and the creation of local advisory and executive councils. 6. The fiscal reform measure is long overdue. The existing system, an inheritance from Turkish days, is responsible for many discriminations and injustices, notably as regards the incidence of the temettu or professional tax. It is to be hoped that the revised system will sweep away the Ottoman basis of taxation to replace it by one on more western lines. 7. The reference in Exchange of Letters No. 6 (bis) to the creation of local councils, combined with the assurances in Exchange of Letters No. 6 of equality of treatment and of opportunity for all, are clearly intended to placate those Moslem elements, especially at Tripoli, which have been conducting a campaign against their inclusion in the Lebanon. The effect of these measures cannot, of course, be judged until the regulations are published, though it is doubtful whether any measures on these lines would suffice to appease the recalcitrant Moslem devotees of union with Syria. 8. Exchange of Letters No. 4 provides for the appointment of Lebanese attaches to French missions at places abroad where the number of Lebanese residents warrants this measure. The provision is a necessary one in view of the size and importance of the Lebanese colonies in North and South America and in many other parts of the world. 9. The two clauses of chief interest to British subjects and institutions in the Lebanon are Exchange of Letters No. 7 and Protocol No. 4. The former maintains all the existing privileges of foreign educational, charitable and [856 z—2] b2 archaeological institutions. The latter provides for a reorganisation of the judicial system by negotiation after ratification of the treaty, but is vaguer than its Syrian counterpart as to what changes are envisaged in the Mixed Courts rdgime. 10. Exchange of Letters No. 9, which confirms the existing parity between the Syrian pounds and the French franc, is noteworthy in view of the recent^ agitation in certain local commercial circles for a revaluation of the former in terms of the franc in order to mitigate the serious effects of the devaluation of the latter on the economic life of the country. 11. So far as I can judge, there do not appear to be serious grounds for objection on the part of His Majesty’s Government to any of the terms of the treaty. It is, however, difficult to contemplate with any satisfaction the emer gence of an independent Lebanon in its present state of development. Little confidence can at present be felt in either the energy, the competence, or the disinterestedness of the Lebanese governing classes, and the withdrawal of the French element in the administration cannot but be followed by deterioration of government and governed. 12. The reception of the treaty has been stormy. Tripoli has already been more or less closed for the past month as a protest against its retention in the Lebanon. In Beirut, Christian rejoicing on the 13th and 14th November was followed on the night of the 15th by a serious clash between Moslem malcontents and Christians (mostly Armenians), during which much damage was done in the town, several cars burnt, and a number of persons injured. On the morning of the 16th a Moslem w^as killed in a street affray, the town was closed, and troops with armoured cars carried out continual patrols to avoid the possibility of further disturbances. To-day, when the Chamber meets to discuss ratification, much excitement prevails and further disorders are not unlikely. It is to be hoped that the long-smouldering hostility between Moslems and Christians will not burst into open flame as a result of the passions roused by the treaty. The natural indolence of the Beirut inhabitants, however, suggests that after a few days of excitement and military measures the population will accept the situation with resignation. 13.

Pull independence would only be effective after admission of Syria to the League, and application for admission was only plated three years ax'ter ratification of Treaty. French Government proposed to negotiate without delay similar agreementwith the Government of the Lebanon. Turkish representative (M.

By the same decree the continuance of the form of government instituted by the “’arrets ’’ 176/LR (my despatch No. 63 of the 8 th December, 1933), is enacted. 2. This order was not entirely unexpected, for one of the many remarks attributed to M. de Martel by journalists, to whom he seems to have been singularly accessible during his recent trip to Paris, was Le traite est signe, a nous de i’executer,” and it has been widely commented upon. The spread of a popular belief that France wants to stand by the treaty, already signed, but rejected by Parliament, is unlikelv to simplify the task of obtaining its ratification (if this is indeed the French goal) by a representative Assembly. 3 .

WITH reference to my despatch No. 56 of the 20th November, 1933, and my telegram No. 14, relative to the Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance, I have the honour to report that the prorogation of Parliament pronounced on the 21st November by the High Commissioner, finding his authority in that all- comprehensive article 116 of the Syrian Constitution, was extended on the 24th November to cover the remainder of the session ending the 31st December. Presumably, therefore, the Chamber will next meet on the 20th March, 1934, after the normal winter recess. 2. At the sitting of the 21st November the French delegate, M. Veber, intervened with the High Commissioner's “ Arrete de Suspension.’' He did so after the members had passed a resolution that the house should proceed to the immediate and detailed discussion of the treaty. This was proposed by the Depute Zeki Bey El Khatib, who, it will be recalled, had been arrested as a couy, but not apparently thereby intimidated, on the 4th November in connexion with the anti-Zionist demonstrations (my despatch No. 53 of the 9th November, 1933). There was an excited scene when M. Veber tried to read the High Commissioner’s proclamation. He was shouted down by Jamil Bey Mardam Bey, who, anticipating the nature of M. Veber’s intervention, announced that he had a list of signatures of the majority of the Deputes testifying that they were already prepared to vote against the treaty, whose merits had been previously disclosed to them. 3. It appears obvious from the High Commissioner's action that his object was to prevent a formal rejection of the treaty by the Parliament. This seems to me to demolish the widely accepted hypothesis that the French were only with extreme reluctance brought to the point of granting a treaty in imitation of our action in Iraq. It is, I understand, the French officials' hope that, between now and March next, the wayward sheep from the French flock in the Parliament may be induced to return to the fold and then there will be a majority to vote in favour of ratification of the treaty as it stands. 4. Camouflage having been put on with less than the usual French artistry, it is not difficult to find reasons in the treaty itself for the French desire to saddle it upon the country in its present form; nor, for the same reasons, to understand the Syrians’ dislike of it. 5. Perhaps it is not without self-interest that the French Government appears anxious to see the stamp of legality put by the Syrians’ elected repre sentatives on a document that keeps Syria as a very exclusive French preserve. The apparent vagueness of the military clauses (article 5 ) finds its definition in the reality of the recently completed imposing fortifications that the French army has erected on the heights west of Damascus and which can but have as their object the domination of the city and, incidentally, the minds of the people and the Members of Parliament. By article 6 , France has assured for herself a number adequate for her purposes of French advisers and magistrates and by article 3 of Protocole “ B ' she keeps tight hold of the purse-strings. Substance is thus given to the belief that the aim of France has from the beginning been not only to safeguard her foothold on the coast, where the population is more tractable, but also to retard the growth of an Arab State or confederation in the hinterland by a system of controlled strangulation. 6 . There are not wanting pointers to confirm the supposition that the ultimate objective of French policy is towards eventual expansion eastwards, when circumstances are more favourable than they are to-day; perhaps it is only another dream of La I ranee orientale. _ Should it ever be realised, the t 6 ’ ENCLOSURE in WEI No. 8 22 FEB. 1334 ' FR9M SECRETARY, POL!

Consul Mackereth to Sir John Simon.—{Received November 27.) ^ Damascus, November 20, 1933. 2 It remains now for the Syrian Parliament to ratify or reject the treaty as signed by its Prime Minister. Without doubt it will meet with lively opposition from the pan-Arab Nationalists, but intensive lobbying, on oriental lines of the Deputies is being conducted by and on behalf of the Irench delegation M. Veber told me this morning that he was afraid a majority lor ratification might not be forthcoming; he had hopes, however, that there would m the end be a bare majority in its favour. 3 . The alternatives to ratification leave an opening lor speculation. I ne French official view appears to be that in the event of the Parliament s rejecting the treaty, a pro-treaty Government can be established deriving its authority from French arms. The official communicjue rather naively states that the pallia mentary vote on the treaty will provide a proof to France and the League o Nations of the possibility or otherwise of Syria’s obtaining its independence by way of agreements. , . , . , -r, a 4. It has been officially and gratuitously proclaimed that the Franco-Synan Treaty is more generous to Syria than the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was to Iraq.' But they protest overmuch. Certainly, the Franco-Syrian Treaty follows along the broad lines of its predecessor in type, yet the curious and obviously intentional vagueness of the drafting, unusual in French texts, leaves ample^room for the suspicion that France has no intention of relinquishing her hold on Syria if she can help it. This, of course, the Nationalists realise and multiply their prayers for another European conflict, hoping thereby that the French girp may be slackened. The treaty now signed furnishes in almost every article a bone tor future contention, and the fifth paragraph of article 5 provides the means whereby France will be on the spot when the wrangle begins. By article 6 , provision is made against a lack of French magistrates, advisers and officials. Possibly the form of General Noury Said’s letter (III) of the 30th June, 1930 (attached to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930), made little appeal to the French official mind. 5 x n article 5 of Protocol B, France promises to use her good offices to obtain Syria’s admission into the League of Nations, if and when Syria has realised the programme of reforms set out in the preceding articles ol that protocol. The time required for the completion of the programme is put quaintly as a “d&amp;ai normal de quatre annees,” whatever that may eventually be held to mea e Should the treaty be ratified by the Parliament, or otherwise obtain formal recognition, I propose to address you in further detail on the subject ol its fuller implications. ^ 7.

GILBERT MACKERETH.COPY (fi 8021/2689/89) r&gt;.1782 (162/28/33) BRITISH BiBASSY, PARIS. 28th Dacomber, 1933. Sir, With reference to your despatch No•1947 (£ 7649/ 2689/89) of the 19th December, I have the honour to state that I took the opportunity of a visit this morning to the Director of African and Levant affairs to ask him point-blank whether there was any foundation for the rumour that the French Government were supporting the candidature of Abdul Majid, son of Sherif All Haidar, to the throne of Syria. Although I thought it possible that I should not receive an entirely frank reply, I saw no other way of obtaining a more reliable, or indeed any kind of answer to your enquiry. 2* The Comte de Saint Quentin repliad that Abdul Majid was one of a number of indifferent aspirants who had cropped up since the death of King Feisal who alone had possessed the qualifications which might have made him a serious candidate. The French Government had no intention at this juncture of supporting any particular candidature. When the proper time came, they would support that of a baker*s son if one appeared on the scene and aspired to become president of the republic, provided his qualifications were superior to those of his rivals• 3. It may have been because I was looking for it that I thought I detected a certain hesitation and possibly a shade of embarrassment in Monsieur de Saint Quentin’s demeanour. At all events the nature of his reply failed to convince me that The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.his Government were altogether a stranger to any idea that Abdul Majid might one day become the candidate of their choice.

Sir, With reference to telegram No. 490 addressed to you on December 11th by His Majesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad, I have the honour to report that I have very good reason to believe that the story that the French authorities propose to put forward as a candidate for the throne of Syria Abdul Medjid, the son of the Sherif A 7 i Haidar, rests on no foundation whatever. How it has come about that M. Lepissier, the French Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, is believed to be responsible for the rumour I do not know. Possibly something he said on his return from Beirut has been misunderstood or mis interpreted. It is a fact that the Sherif Ali Haidar called on M. de Martel, as he has called on other French High Commissioners, and probably M. de Martel has returned or will return the call. Possibly the 3herif was seen at the Grand 5erail and his presence there gave rise to the rumour. 2. That Abdul Medjid has for a long time been on the look out for a throne, either for his father or for himself, is no secret. His ambition is quite comprehensible. Quite apart from the His Majesty* s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs family'V t family traditions, its members here are to-day in relatively poor circumstances so that the possession of a Civil List would be invaluable. S. Recently Abdul Medjid who is with some reason considered to be not specially intelligent called on me with the request that I would send by bag to Sir Andrew Ryan from his father a long letter in Turkish. I gathered that the letter asked His Majesty’s Minister to do anything he could to further the interests of the Sherif All Haidar should the situation between Ibn Saoud and the Imam Yahia so develope as to render it likely that the throne of the Hedjaz might become vacant. Abdul Medjid seemed to believe that Ibn Saoud might eventually have to abandon the Hedjaz and retire to Hejd. I expressed regret that it was quite impossible for me to transmit a document of the kind in an official bag. I have, etc. (Signed) H. F.. Satow.Ho. 1947.

Section 1. [E 4159/120/89] No. 1. Acting Consul Todd to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 28.) (No. 37.) Sir, Damascus, July 20, 1933. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the local press comments on the appointment of M. de Martel as the successor of M. Henri Ponsot are generally favourable. 2. The Fata-el-Arab (Moderate) hopes that the new High Commissioner will use his abilities and experience in oriental affairs to bring about a complete solution of the Syrian question, so that Syria will realise that she is at last a country having the same rights as other independent countries and able to treat political and social questions as she understands them. The journal hopes that he will not spend too much time studying a question which has already been studied in all its aspects by previous commissioners and by the Quai d’Orsay. Franco-Syrian collaboration is inevitable, and this collaboration should be directed towards enabling Syria to realise her known claims, and enabling France to consolidate her moral and material interests in this part of the Near East. Syria is at present menaced by a policy which can be described as an economic blockade, the centre of which is Haifa. In such circumstances, the regime of M. de Martel should comprise economic and political competition. Nothing, this paper asserts, could be more effective in eradicating the influence of Haifa than a comprehensive and well-conceived plan of political and economic action in which France and Syria would act in common. 3. Al Chaab (Moderate) thinks that France, noticing that M. Ponsot was unsuccessful in untying the Syrian knot in spite of a programme prepared very thoroughly, has had recourse to another man of experience, in the person of M. de Martel, who is an expert in oriental politics and possesses a deep knowledge of the oriental character, customs, traditions, &amp;c. The journal hopes that M. de Martel will not come to Syria before he has mastered every question, large and small. 4. The Alef Ba (anti-Nationalist) says that the new High Commissioner will not arrive in Syria without his “ new costume,” which is now being made in Paris. In other words, it is very probable that he will not spend months and years in studying the question, as his predecessors have done, but will proclaim what has already been accomplished and keep an eye on its application. 5. The reaction of the extreme Nationalists to the new appointment is not clearly defined as their organ, Al Ayyam, was indefinitely suspended a short while ago. However, the following statement of one of their number no doubt sums up the general opinion of their party. 6. The Nationalists, he said, see in the appointment a proof that France desires to rid herself of Syria, to conclude a treaty with her, and to introduce her as a member of the League of Nations. One of the factors, he continued, which has induced France to make the change is that she considers that M. Ponsot, having brought matters to the point of a treaty, is no longer capable of taking the last hurdle, i.e., that of the actual negotiation and conclusion of a treaty. 7. The press does not contemplate the possibility of the whole question being put into the melting-pot and the progress achieved up to the present largely dissipated as a result. 8.

Sir, Acting ( onsul I odd to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 16.) . Damascus, June 7, 1933. I HAVE the honour to inform you that various political groups in Damascus ha\e taken advantage of the opportunity offered by the passage of King Feisal of Iraq through Amman on the 5th—9th instant, to present him with a petition piaying him to intercede with the French Government in the question of Svrian unity. 2. I transmit herewith the original text (') of this petition, together with a translation. Various journalists and representatives of the above-mentioned groups, including a representative of the political deportees, have proceeded to Amman to present this petition, which contains many thousands of signatures, personally to His Majesty. The Nationalist party was, however, not represented although there was a rumour that Hashem Bey El Atassi, the Nationalist leader at Homs, would be there. In spite of their decision not to be represented as a party, Jamil Bey, Mardam Bey and Mazhar Pasha Raslan, Nationalist Deputies, have gone in a private capacity. 3. This action of the Nationalist party in thus dissociating itself from the rest of the country as represented by the other political groups, has caused a good deal of commotion in political circles, and is liable to embitter their alreadv strained relations with the other parties. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s consul- general at Beirut and His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo. I he nation request His Majesty King Feisal to intervene for the solution of the Syrian problem. His Majesty the Hashimite King Feisal the First, FHE Arab—Syrian nation, which fought and made great sacrifices for the purpose of obtaining its national unity and complete sovereignty, and to which the Allies gave pledges for the realisation of Syrian national aspirations, look to His Majesty the Hashimite, on the occasion of his visit to Europe, and beseech him humbly to look into the Syrian problem, while this land of ours is passing through such a critical period, and thus convince the French Government that the Syrian demands are just and that they should be granted. The Syrian negotiator was unable to make the voice of this country heard, and to persuade the French that they should abandon the old policy, which so far has caused this land social and economic sufiering, and has broken the bonds between the people who are exposed to such a severe economic crisis. Thus, the resources of wealth were cut off and poverty and confusion prevailed in all parts of this land. The Syrians, however, hope that through the wide influence of His Majesty the great Arab King and through his perfect knowledge of the political stages I have, &amp;c. FRANK H. TODD.

Therefore, we the undersigned, who represent all the denominations of the Syrian population, both in the interior and in the coastal regions, irrespective of their religious creeds and political views, hereby submit this petition to His Hashimite Majesty, begging him to intervene with the French Government for the solution of their problem, the attainment of absolute unity and complete independence for this land. The nation offer their sincere gratitude and abiding thanks to His Majesty, and pray Almighty God to bring his activities to a successful end and protect him with his helping hand.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS SRITJWT* IC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Syria). - 86 ✓ s May 31, 1933.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 28 of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to inform you that I was present at tKeTNesumed sitting of the Chamber on the 8th instant. 2. As on the previous occasion, the shops were closed as a protest against the present constitution of the Cabinet. A good many of the shopkeepers wished to keep their shops open, but were compelled by groups of students and agitators, who threatened them with violence, to put up their shutters. A few shops did actually remain open until noon, but afterwards were compelled to fall into line with the rest. The streets leading to the Parliament building were heavily guarded by gendarmes and police equipped with revolvers and batons. Furthermore, machine guns had been placed at various strategic points in the town and on the roofs of certain buildings. These extensive precautions against disorder had a sobering effect on the extremists and there was complete calm throughout the day. 3. The Nationalist Deputies once again refrained from attending the sitting, but even so there were forty-four Deputies present—all supporters of the present Cabinet. 4. The President of the Council, Hakki Bey El Azm, read the ministerial declaration, which in essence stated the determination of the Government to maintain order and public safety. This was an essential prerequisite for the realisation of the country’s national aspirations in the political, economic and social sphere. Their efforts would be directed towards obtaining guarantees for their independence and sovereignty, and the abolition of the mandate through the signature of a treaty with the French defining the future relations between France and Syria. The Government would carry on the present negotiations with the chief object of realising Syrian unity. 5. The proposed legislative programme of the Government included measures of economy to balance the budget, help for the peasants and the trading community, judicial reform for the improvement of the administration of justice, greater educational facilities, decentralisation of the administrative system, special consideration for the rights of minorities, &amp;c. 6. The House was asked to vote on these proposals, and after certain explanations had been given by Chaker Bey Chabani (Minister of Finance), a vote of confidence in the Government was passed with only one abstention. 7. The sitting was thereupon adjourned until the 11th, having lasted forty-five minutes. 8. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s consul- general at Beirut and His Majesty’s consul at Aleppo. I have, &amp;c. FRANK H. TODD.

Beirut, May 4, 1933. ’ 1 HAVE the honour to report that M. Ruppel, the German delegate on the Permanent Mandates Commission, recently came up from Palestine to pay a ®hoi t visit to Syria and the Lebanon. He is regarded here as a rather unsympathetic critic of French mandatory methods and his visit was apparently not very welcome, especially as it was made at a time when renewed trouble is being experienced with the extreme Syrian Nationalists by reason of their insistence that the question of “Syrian Unity,” that is the immediate inclusion m the State of Syria of the Government of Lattakia and of the Jebel Druse, must be settled as they wish before any discussion of the treaty which is to be the beginning of the end of the mandate can be possible. At such a time, the visit of the German delegate might well have proved an encouragement to the extremists and have led them to accentuate their manifestations of dissatisfaction. The presence of an eye-witness who would go back to Geneva with a first-hand account of the of trouble he had seen might seem to offer too good a chance to be missed. Thy German consul in Beirut is a free critic of French methods, and he went with M. Ruppel to Damascus. I happened to meet him on his return when he remarked rather gloatingly, as it seemed to me, that his compatriot had been able to see for himself how “ contented ” the Syrians were with present conditions. I replied that the Nationalists would presumably never be content so long as there was any foreign control, whatever the nationality of the foreigner, and the conversation changed. M. Ruppel was, I believe, in Damascus when the shops were closed in protest, and there was considerable evidence of armed force. Although the local press has stated that he went about taking photographs and had interwews with Nationalist leaders, the German consul categorically denies this. He emphasises that M. Ruppel came here as a tourist, having, as a director ot the company, had the advantage of a free passage on a ship of the V oermann Line. 2. ’ M. Ponsot mentioned the visit to me in the course of a conversation which I had with him while waiting for Sir Arthur Wauchope at the Residency on the morning after his arrival. He told me that M. Ruppel had asked him n he could go to Damascus, and that he had replied that, there being nothing to conceal, he was entirely free to do as he wished in the matter. M. Ponsot spoke as it the visit of M. Ruppel was, in his opinion, neither particularly well timed nor 3 The French High Commissioner in the course of the conversation also referred to the “Syrian Unity” question. He said that he had fold the Nationalists that he ’was not prepared to share his responsibilities. While the mandate lasted the responsibility was his, and when it was terminated it would be for the independent Syrian Government to settle their own difficulties. He did not intend to place under the Syrian Government the Alawites and the Druses, who at present seemed sincerely to dislike the idea. It was for the Syrian Go\ernment, when it had really found its feet and when a suitable time came—for example, when the treaty was on the point of being made or soon after it had been concluded—to persuade the others that it was in their interest to throw in their lots with it. There might be trouble and in that case who was going to settle it ? He would not, and he did not believe that the Damascus politicians could. So long as he was responsible he had to decide what was best. 4. On the following day M. Ponsot met with an accident which obliged him to take to his bed, where it is said he may have to remain for some weeks. Although it was at first rumoured that he was suffering from phlebitis, apparently the trouble is only a badly sprained ankle. However that may be, he ns for a time more or less out of action, although he has installed an office in his bedroom and is carrying on as best he can. At the same time, to judge from reports in [795 -1]the Beirut press, the settlement of the Ministerial crisis caused by the withdrawal of the two Nationalist Ministers in the circumstances described in Damascus despatch No. 26 of the 24th April is taking longer than might have been hoped. It is in these circumstances not surprising that suggestions are appearing in the press that the treaty negotiations will have to be postponed until after M. Ponsot’s t return from Geneva and Paris.

Damascus, May 2, 1933. ’ WITH reference to Colonel Mackereth’s despatch No^26 of the 24th April, 1933, regarding the political situation, I have the honour to inform you that the Chamber duly reassembled on the 27th April in spite of rumours alleging that no further session would be held until October. 2. The shops were again closed all day, but there were on this occasion no public demonstrations owing to the very thorough measures adopted by the authorities, which effectually prevented the hot-heads from causing trouble. Ine Nationalist Deputies again abstained from attendance, but nevertheless the Chamber mustered forty-four Deputies out of a total of sixty-nine. The Deputy from Aleppo, Chaker Bey Chabani, a Constitutional Liberal and member of the French party, made a speech condemning the absence of the Deputies in question. He reminded his audience that, according to the rules of the Chamber, Deputies wishing to absent themselves from its sittings for any period up to eight days must obtain the previous consent of the President of the Chamber; if for more than eight davs, then the previous permission of the Chamber as a whole must be obtained. It follows, therefore, continued Chaker Bey Chabani, that a Deputy who deliberately absents himself should be punished by not being allowed to collect the monthly salary from the Chamber payable to all Deputies, and which amounts to £Syr. 100 per month (equivalent, at present exchange rate of 430 Syrian piastres to the £1 sterling, to over £23 sterling). Consequently, he felt it to be his duty to bring in a motion demanding the suspension of the salary of any Deputy wilfully absenting himself from the Chamber and thus neglecting to perform his public duties. This motion was, however, adjourned on the proposal of M. Djanji and Ghaleb Brahim, the Chamber evidently finding it inconvenient to adopt such a measure at the present time. 3. The President of the Council then demanded a further adjournment of the Chamber until the 8th May to enable the Ministry to be reconstructed, as the resignation of the two Ministers had only been accepted definitely by the President of the Republic two days before. The adjournment was voted unanimously. 4 Before the Chamber dispersed the President of the Chamber pointed out that in spite of the abstentions of certain Deputies the Chamber could still muster two thirds of its total number. This statement is significant, as two thirds is the quorum required by article 102 of the Constitution to enable an^ amendments to be made in the Constitution itself. . . . . 5. A solution to the present ministerial crisis is proving more difficult to overcome than was originally expected. Conversations have taken place between the President of the Republic (Mohamed Ali Bey El-Abed), the President of the Chamber (Soubhi Bey Barakat) and the President of the Council (Hakki Bey El-Azm) on the one hand, and both the High Commissioner at Beirut and his delegate in Damascus on the other. Nothing has transpired as to the nature or result of these conversations and no names of possible candidates for the vacant posts have appeared in the press. Negotiations with the Irench authorities are &lt; still proceeding, and a solution is expected by the time Parliament reassembles. I have, &amp;c. FRANK H.

Acting Consul Todd to Sir John Simon.—(Received May 24.) (No. 29.) Sir, Damascus, May 4, 1933. WITH reference to my despatch No. 28 of the 2nd instant, I have the honour to inform you that the Cabinet was reconstituted yesterday under the presidency of Hakki Bey-el-Azm. 2. The composition of the new Ministry is as follows :— Hakki Bey-el-Azm: President of the Council and Minister of Interior. Chaker Bey Chabani : Finance. Yahia Bey Adali : Agriculture and Commerce. Sheikh Suleiman Joukhadar : Justice. Selim Bey Jambart: Public Works and Education. 3. It appears that Nassouh Bey-el-Boukhari accepted, and at the last moment refused, the post of Minister of Public Instruction. He was formerly Minister of Agriculture under Damad in 1926-27. The reason for his refusal is not clear. He asked in vain for the Ministry of Finance. He was also influenced in his decision by statements in the Nationalist press urging him not to sever his family’s long connexion with the Nationalist cause by his joining the new Cabinet. 4. The new Cabinet is composed entirely of moderate elements without Nationalist participation. A separate Ministry has been created, i.e., the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Its members are all Deputies with the exception of Suleiman-el-Joukhadar. Chaker Bey Chabani comes in as Minister of Finance in place of Jamil Mardam Bey. The former is a Constitutional Liberal and Deputy for Aleppo. The new Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Yahia Bey Adali, is the Deputy for Antioche, a Liberal, and, incidentally the oldest Deputy in the present Parliament. Suleiman-el- Joukhadar is not a Deputy, and his acceptance of the post of Minister of Justice, in place of the Nationalist Mazhar Pasha, represents his first incursion into the political arena. He is a member of the Reform party, and was defeated at the elections of 1932. He was formerly president of Court of Cassation. Selim Jambart, a moderate of Aleppo, was also Minister of Public Works in the late Cabinet. It was rumoured at the time of the resignation of Jamil Mardam Bey and Mazhar Pasha Rislan that he had also sent in his resignation, but this report proved to be unfounded. He thus becomes Minister of Public Works and Education. 5. It is not yet known whether the Nationalist Deputies will attend the next session of the Chamber on the 8th May. 6. The formation of the new Cabinet has met with a good deal of hostile criticism on the part of Nationalist elements here, and various delegations waited on the President of the Republic yesterday to urge him to abstain from forming a Government until formal assurances had been obtained from the French authorities on the subject of Syrian unity. 7. The present Government does not represent the feeling of the majority of the population, and it is feared that it will negotiate a treaty with the French involving the sacrifice of the principle of unity. 8. The bazaars were closed yesterday afternoon as a protest against the formation of a pro-French Cabinet, as soon as its composition became known. 9. This solution of the ministerial crisis is probably the best that could be found in the circumstances, but in view of the non-co-operation of the Nationalists and even of their active hostility to the new Government, only the future can show whether the Cabinet will be able to withstand the attacks of the Nationalists when the Chamber meets. 10.

The Syrian question : and other matters of importance to the pan-Arah movement will he discussed in Europe while King Peisal is there. A report from a reliable and secret source in Baghdad states that Haj Amin el Husseini has been given a large sum of money and letters of introduction tothe chief Mujtahids of Nejaf. It is alleged that in return he promises to support King Peisal in his claims to the Caliphate. While in Baghdad, the Delegation has endeavoured to enlist sympathy for the Arab Palestine cause and create feeling against Jewry, to urge the local Committee to get busy regarding the Congress in Baghdad and also to obtain money, the objects of which are already Known. It is not considered that the Delegation will achieve considerable success owing to the scarcity of money, besides which the Iraqian is not likely to finance agitation abroad. A/joreover, he is suspicious of several Arabs who have profited by land transactions with Jews. It is noteworthy tnat Moslems and Jews in Iraq have always got on very well together. Nevertheless a note of anti-Jewish propaganda is apparent. This is thought to be possible owing to the influence of German residents in Baghdad. \2 /i -4§) i C In their public speeches in Iraq, the Delegation have ^ been careful to voice only the usual platitudes. The advancement of the idea of Jerusalem as a Moslem educational centre has not found favour amongst the Iraqis as was hoped* The following illustrates their attitude In discussing the ideals of the Congress it is alleged that Haj Amin likened the Arab Nation to a human body, allotting to Arab countries certain members stating the tasks which the various anatomical portions performed. Apparently believing he had illustrated his argument, he sat down. An Iraqi present cynically pointed out that whereas a wonderful body had been portrayed, stated that the Mufti had omitted to give it a head, and asked whether they were to draw their own conclusions as to whether this was a true representation of Arab unity. At the general reception of the Delegation, the Prime Minister and Cabinet members were conspicuous by their absence. The Shias of Kadhimain state they are not interested. The visit of King Feisal and ex-King Ali to Amman and then to Europe, the rumoured intended visit of King Feisal to King Fouad, the arrival of Emir Adel Arslan in Jerusalem, which wa^oon followed by the visit of Sheikh Yousef Yasin, Secretary of Ibn Sioud, the departure of Emir Adel to Europe to which Yasin Pasha el Hashimi, it is rumoured, is expected to repair, the Power of attorney prepared for King Feisal by a section of the Syrians, the travel of Hassan Khaled Pasha to see Abbas Hilmi ana the expected congregation of politicians in Amman have all been cited in/) - 3 - in Arab circles as an indication of important discussions on pan-Arab and perhaps pan-Islamic schemes. The sympathies of Arab politicians are now divided between Ibn Sioud and King Feisal and the Hashemite family. Which sympathies will dominate and guide their future activity it is not possible to say.INDEXED In any further communication on thU subject, please A N «- E , , and address —not to any person by name, but to— _ • Tbe Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

[E 2508/120/89] Mr. Cowan to Sir John Simon.—[Received May 13.) (No. 19.) Sir, Ale'p'po, May 2, 1933. ’ I HAVE the honour to report that on the 30th April the leader of the Aleppo Nationalists, Ibrahim Bey Hanano, returned to Aleppo from Damascus. His partisans in Aleppo seized the occasion to stage an imposing demonstration, partly no doubt in order to honour Hanano, but more particularly to impress the strength of Nationalist feeling an^ of French unpopularity on his Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Herr Reuben, said to be a German delegate from the League of Nations. Unfortunately for the demonstrators both these gentlemen had left Aleppo before the demonstration began. 2. In the afternoon about a hundred cars and three char-a-bancs conveyed the wealthier Nationalists to Ourem-es-Soughra, a village about 10 miles outside Aleppo, while a large crowd proceeded to the Cazkhaneh, a little further out, at the junction of the Damascus and Alexandretta roads. All these people were unarmed. Suddenly a detachment of Spahis with a few tanks and armoured cars appeared at the cross-roads and began to hustle the mob, w T ho became panic- stricken and resisted. Thereupon the troops fired and the crowd fled, but the road was blocked by the cars which had come out from town and confusion ensued. In the course of the firing and subsequent confusion two people are reported to have been killed and about twenty injured. The troops then searched the waiting cars for arms, but found none, but the occupants of the cars were forced to alight and return to Aleppo on foot, while the cars were driven back by another route. Hanano’s car was the only one which was not interfered with. 3. Meanwhile, measures had been taken to prevent rioting in the town, but the Aleppo police are far from efficient in such matters and crowds had assembled in the principal streets. In one place stones were thrown at the police and one constable, who was hard pressed, fired his revolver in the air. This was taken by the supporting troops as a signal for their intervention, and they and the police charged the crowd, who immediately dispersed. So far as I can ascertain there were no casualties. 4. The general impression in the town seems to be that the military and the police rather lost their heads and gave undeserved importance to an episode which, properly handled, would have passed off quietly. There is certainly some thing to be said for this point of view, but it must be remembered that with an unreliable police force the demonstration might easily have developed into a serious riot, which would have entailed severe measures of repression. Faced with the alternative of being blamed either for excessive severity or laxity, the French authorities chose the former. Had they chosen the second alternative the demonstration would almost certainly have had very serious consequences as popular excitement increased. 5. The general effect of the events described on the local Nationalist party has been to discourage them. Many of the leaders believe that no course is now open to them but to appeal to the League of Nations. They are not, however, united in this opinion, and it is felt that cleavages will soon appear in the party, which will render it ineffective for political action. Meanwhile, the leading Nationalists are conferring among themselves, but their conferences are not expected to lead to anything. It is significant of the discouragement felt that no leading Nationalist has so far ventured to intervene on behalf of the numerous persons arrested in connexion with this affair. 6.

No steps have so far been taken regarding the remaining sections in Turkish territory, which under the agreement are to be administered by a Franco-Turkish company, but it is understood that a French railway olficial is at present at Ankara with a view to settling this question. 2. The Bozanti-Alep-Nissibin et Prolongements are very anxious to extend their line from Tell Zivan to the Iraq frontier, and a few weeks ago a strong rumour was current here that this undertaking had actually been sanctioned by the French High Commissioner. For financial reasons, however, the immediate realisation of this scheme appears improbable. 3. The railway company have, however, another scheme in contemplation, which is much more likely to be carried out. This is the institution of a service of motor transport in vehicles owned by the company from Tell Zivan, the present railhead, to Mosul and Kirkuk. If this project is executed through bills of lading will then be given by the railway to the two places named from Alexandretta and Aleppo. This scheme would greatly strengthen the claims of Alexandretta to become the transit port for goods destined for Iraq and Northern Persia, though at present everything points to this position being granted to Beirut. 4. I enclose a table which I have obtained from the Bozanti-Alep-Nissibin et Prolongements showing the transport rates for goods from Alexandretta and Aleppo to Tell Zivan, and the estimated rates by motor from Tell Zivan to Mosul and Kirkuk^ 1 ) 5.

Ponsot at Geneva in December last, when he announced the intention of the French Government to proceed with negotiations for a treaty providing for the eventual autonomy of Syria. . ^ ^ , . • r 2 Mr. Williamson-Napier’s survey sets out with clarity the evolution ot French and Syrian ideas about the termination of the mandatory system in this country, and at the present time it is of particular value by providing a background drawn in what 1 think suitable perspective m relation to whit future events may be seen in just proportion . , ^ 3. It is difficult to contest the general conclusion arrived at in the nnai paragraph of the memorandum/ It may, however, be thought that it has been just that insistence of the French plan upon what they consider their traditional right in these parts as the sole protectors of Christendom that has all along made their relations with the Mahometan population of Syria so difficult. It has left them open to the charge of hypocrisy, creating an atmosphere of mistrust unfavourable to the present negotiations. I have, &amp;e. GILBERT MACKFRETH. Enclosure 1 in No. 1.

Whatever accusations mav have been levelled against these advisers, they appear to be, on the whole, an efficient body of men sincerelv devoted to the interests of their Syrian employers and chafing under the control of their own compatriots. * ^ , , 5. Since the suspension of Capitulations, Mixed Courts have been established to hear causes in which a foreign national or interest is involved.o These courts function well, and there is a tendency on the part of Syrian nationals to include a foreigner in their partnerships with a view to taking advantage of this form of jurisdiction. The judicial system is still incomplete and fails to conform with article 6 of the Syrian mandate in regard to the rights of foreigners in the administration of the laws of inheritance. Palestinians, Iraqis and Transjordanians are not entitled to Mixed Courts jurisdiction. ^ 6. The main source of revenue is customs dues, which, for the whole of th® mandated territory, are pooled in a common fund administered by a central administration, under the immediate supervision of the High Commissioner and known as the “ Compte de gestion des services d’interet commun.” Receipts are distributed on a quota basis to the Lebanon. Syria, the Gebel Druse, &amp;c. The co-efficient is calculated on estimates of consumption of imported products, the per capita importation of the Lebanese being obviously higher than that of a nomad Bedouin. Contributions to common expenditure, e.g., the share of the mandated territory as a whole to the Ottoman public debt, are proportionate to receipts. Such is the system in broad outline. The quotas are subject to revision, and, needless to say, give occasion to invidious comparison. There are various forms of direct taxation and municipal dues, adapted from the old Ottoman regime. The Tobacco Monopoly was abandoned in favour of indirect taxation. The local currency is linked with the French franc, but the Turkish gold pound is frequently used as a basis for commercial transactions. 7. Syria has at last begun to feel the full effects of the general depression. Great difficulty is experienced in collecting the taxes, and the number and salaries of Government officials have been considerably reduced in order to balance the budget. It is thought that the limit in this difection has now been reached and that future economies will have to be effected in Public Works and similar undertakings. There will doubtless be difficulties in grappling with the unemployment problem. Not the least disquieting feature in the financial situation is not only the complete cessation of remittances from abroad, but also the return of impoverished emigrants claiming hospitality from relatives whom they previously supported. The whole economic fabric o? the country has thus been considerably shaken, and the full results have not yet been felt. 8. Syria is an agricultural country, but the margin of produce available for export never having been a large one, the fall in world prices has not affected the situation as much as in some other countries. On the other hand, two successive years of drought have been disastrous. Attempts have recently been made to establish the local manufacture of certain commodities previously imported, but commerce, generally, is at a standstill. The laying down of the pipe-lme from Mosul is absorbing a certain amount of labour, but has not added materially to the prosperity of the country. 9. In the matter of public education the French have taken the greatest interest, and the propagation of the French language, initiated long before the war by religious institutions, has been vigorously pursued by the lay administra tion. The high schools for medicine and law are believed to* be excellent. Nearly 200 young Syrians are completing their studies in France, where they are placed under the supervision of an inspector. It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to absorb these highly-educated young men and how they will react to unemployment. 10. The public health services appear well organised, and there is now an ample supply of good drinking-water. The police are no more inept than in most countries. 11. The nomad (Bedouin) tribes are subject to a special regime in regard to administration of justice, taxation, customs, and penetration into foreign territory. The latter has rendered necessary special agreements with Turkey, Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine, and a close co-operation should exist between the various officials of the countries concerned in the settlement of tribal disputes and cognate matters. Minor friction between rival tribes and between the latter and the sedentary population appear to have been less acute of recent years. On the other hand, the diminishing demand for camels, followed by an increase in sheep production, together with the recent droughts, and consequent shortage of pasturage, are likely to render the encroachments of the tribes on cultivated territory a menace which may prove difficult to handle, in spite of determined and praiseworthy efforts on the part of the French Administration to improve the water supply in the desert. The traditional antagonism between the two mostimportant tribes—the Ruwalla and the Sbaa—shows no signs of abating. The Bedouins have their own representatives in Parliament. Their very serious contribution to national prosperity (exports), coupled with their existence as a permanent source of potential trouble, have continued to constitute a problem requiring constant vihgance on the part of the mandatory authority. 12. In regard to foreign affairs, the delimitation of the frontiers between ^yria, Iraq, Palestine and Turkey has made good progress, and will shortly be completed. There are customs conventions in force between Syria and the neighbouring States according special treatments to goods of local manufacture. The pilgrimage traffic and inter-tribal movements are governed by a recent “ convention d’amitie et bon-voisinage ” between the Saudi Arabia and Syria. The overland desert route between Iraq and Syria is subject to certain restrictions, mutually agreed upon by the two countries concerned. Extradition of fugitive offenders is also provided for. The harbouring of political refugees by certain States bordering on Syria was a source of considerable friction during the disorders of 1925 and 1926, and bred an atmosphere of suspicion and mutual antipathy between certain officials of the mandatory Powers concerned. This feeling has, fortunately, at long last, been dissipated. A frequent interchange of visits between “ opposite numbers ” cannot fail to have beneficial results. 13. To a much greater extent than in Iraq and Palestine, the maintenance of order and security is entrusted to the armed forces of the mandatory Pow'er, the annual cost of which is no less than 300 million francs. Nevertheless, ^reat strides have been made in the organisation of a locally-recruited army, of which, however, 50 per cent, of the officers are French. This proportion is gradually being adjusted, as native officers become available from the local School of Instruction. There are practically no French rank and file in the French army of occupation, this material consisting of Senegalese, North Africans and Indo- Chinese. The general “ tone ” amongst the officers is by no means brilliant. Jealousy and petty dissensions, based on class-prejudice, are the order of the day. There is no love lost between officers and civilian officials, and this atmosphere does not add to the social amenities of life in Syria. Nor does it pass unnoticed by the Syrians themselves. The air force, though strong in numbers, is stated to be poorly equipped. At present the “ Syrian ” army is not regarded as capable of coping single-handed with the requirements of the situation. At some future date, the price of French-bought security will doubtless form the subject of painful negotiations. 14. Such appears to be the situation in regard to purely domestic affairs. There are certain questions of major policy which have a wider implication. 15. The greatest problem which confronts the French—and which is also of immediate British interest—is the question of Syrian unity. It has two distinct and inextricable aspects, political and economic. As it must inevitably play a leading part in the ultimate destiny of the whole Near East, it appears to deserve particular comment. 16. The eviction of King Feisal from Damascus was the first blow to the idea of “ Arab Empire.” The reshuffling of the territories under French occupa tion (not mandate) was a logical sequel which in itself strengthened the case for watertight compartments—Iraq, Palestine. But whereas Iraq and Palestine are economic propositions, the geographical expression “ Syria is not. On the other hand, were the French, at this stage of economic depression in the Greater Lebanon, to return the seceded territories to Syria, there would not only be an outcry from the Maronites who invited the French to act as their protector, but the reduced area of the Lebanon would be incapable of independent economic existence. It would either become a colossal burden, or, against the wills of the inhabitants, absorbed into Syria. In either event, the mandate would end in disastrous failure, and the prestige of all mandatory Powers might well be impaired. 17. M. Ponsot, in his declarations at Geneva, by no means excluded the possibilities of ultimate “ unity.” The results of the elections, and the general trend of public thought since then, would appear to justify the view expressed in paragraph 11 of Damascus despatch No. 84 of the 3rd November 1931, that a large mass of the population would welcome a treaty on the basis of the present Syria, and be content to await the outcome of future events. 18. The question of a general amnesty to political offenders—one of the Nationalists’ claims which enjoys popular support—may well lead to minor [767 aa—1] b 24 demonstrations, but is capable of adjustment. The economic depression, and the growing numbers of semi-educated “ efiendis who cannot be absorbed in public service or liberal professions may also be the source of future tribulation. 19. There appears to be no reason to exaggerate the importance of the grievances and misgivings of the so-called minorities, a favourite hobby-horse of the Christian journalist. With the present improved means of communication—^ wireless, battleships, roads, aeroplanes—a repetition of the massacres of I860 is not likely to occur. The electoral law seems adequate to present requirements. 20. In attempting to reach any sort of conclusion, it may be of importance to consider certain characteristics of the local population. The tourist, in his contacts with hotel servants (the flotsam and jetsam of Syria), is frequently misled as to the standard of intelligence of the average Syrian. A parrot-like aptitude for foreign languages—so common in the Nubian Berbereen of Egypt is more often than not the sign of a completely vacuous brain. In Egypt there are many striking examples of Syrian brain, initiative and enterprise, whilst in South America their activities, tending in possibly less reputable directions, have been crowned with prosperity. In Svria itself, Greeks, Jews, Armenians and the like —for whom Egypt is an El Dorado—find it practically impossible to compete with local talent. Remarkably astute in commercial transactions, their peculiai ability for trimming their sails according to the wind, is amply illustrated by the elastic attitude displayed bv their political leaders in their dealings with the French. Even the “ die-hards ” are not intractable. These very characteristics, however, render the Syrians an extremely difficult proposition as parties to negotiation. The part played by religious communities is not nearly so complex or important in Syria as it is in the Lebanon. 21. Looking back on the principal stages through which the country has been laboriously led to the possession of an elected Parliament, a representative Government with a presentable President; comparing the chaos which existed in 1925 and 1926 with the state of affairs to-day; but, above all, in measuring the process of evolution which has taken place in the minds of the leaders of public thought, one is led to the conviction that wholesale condemnation of the French administration and policy in this country is not entirely justified. And in forming an opinion of their achievements, we must not forget that, as the ti aditional champions of Christianity in this part of the world, the French have been obstructed by a formidable barrier of Moslem antagonism. A. N. W. NAPIER. Damascus, March 30, 1933. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. The French Mandate in Syria. Summary of Events from the End of the War till February 1933. UNDER the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, France was authorised, on the successful termination of hostilities with the Ottoman Empire, to assume control of the coastal area of Syria and Cilicia, and to protect an Arab State in the interior. This agreement was confirmed and carried into effect m October 1919. ., 2. In March 1920 Emir Feisal, who had contributed to the Allied cause, proclaimed himself “King of Syria” at Damascus. The French Government, alarmed at the growing extent of the Emir’s domination, called on him to recognise their rights in respect to this ex-enemy territory. The ultimatum being disregarded, General Gouraud, the High Commissioner, was obliged to take military action. Feisal’s army was routed^ on the 21st July, and General Gouraud entered Damascus and installed a Government. 3. In August 1920 General Gouraud issued a series of decrees subdividing the territory under French control {not mandate) into separate administrative areas. In creating the Greater Lebanon, the original Syria was deprived ot0 wide strips of fertile territory—a bone of contention which has not ceased to be the basis of Syria’s claim to “ Unity.” Hakki Bey hl-Azm was appointed Governor of the State of Damascus. 4. The mandate to France for Syria and the Lebanon was promulgated by the League of Nations in July 1922, but did not come into force till September 1923. Meanwhile, General Weygand had arrived as High Commissioner, and a federal Council of the three Governorates of Aleppo, Damascus and Lattakie (Alaouites) was established under the presidency of Soubhi Bey Barakat, each district having an elected “ Representative Council.” In Damascus the elections were boycotted by the Nationalists. . i j • v, 5. A petition from the Representative Council of Lattakie resulted m the latter territory being excluded from the Federation, and led in January 1925 to the creation of the “ State of Syria,” comprising Aleppo, Damascus and the Saniak of Alexandretta. The latter retained a form of administrative independence, and the Governorate of Lattakie achieved a form of autonomy, depending on Beirut. The first President of the State of Syria was Soubhi Bey Barakat. He was appointed by the High Commissioner, General Sarrail, who had arrived in November 1924. . . . . ^ , 6. The new President formed a Cabinet consisting of elements not antagonistic to French authority (e.g., Ata Bey Ayoubi), but the Representati\e Council ” (for the State of Syria) elected in March, with the participation ot the Nationalists (the President was Badi Bey Mouayyad), uttered a violent protest against the “ defective ” unity and the compulsory confirmation of presidential decrees by the High Commissioner. . , , ^ 7. The general unrest which had been simmering throughout 1924 m the form of mild demonstration finally came to a head with the revolt of the Druses, who threatened to carry with them the rest of Syria by penetrating into the ci y of Damascus in October 1925. Strong measures were undoubtedly necessary, and the bombardment of Damascus under the orders of General Sarrail eliminated the danger of a wholesale insurrection and massacre, but did not put an end to a series of sporadic, but serious, risings, which lasted until the end of 192U The French were severely criticised for acerbating the minds of the Moslem maioritv bv emploving Armenian (and other Christian) mercenaries for suppressing the rebellion on the same lines as the ” Black and .Tans were used in Ireland Justifiable, no doubt, in the light of major considerations it is a chapter in the recent historv of Syria which will not lightly be foi gotten, and calculated to foster the traditional prejudice of the Moslems against the French in this ‘UariTthe end of 1925, Soubhi Bey was obliged to resign the nresidency owing to the lack of public support, he was careful to recapitulate, in view of future eventualities, the grievances which had previously been expressed by the Representative Council. The country was then placed undei the direct Government of a French Administrator (M. Pierre Alype). 9 When M de Jouvenal left France on his appointment as High Commissioner in November 1925, he was doubtless imbued with ideas of extreme Liberalism and appeared to make a sincere attempt to conciliate the extremists. In a speech U Damascus he referred to the future prosperity of the united states of Syria and the Lebanon.’ A new President was appointed foi t e State of Syria in the person of Damad Ahmad Nami Bey who, however, utterly failed to maintain discipline in a Cabinet which contained several Nationalists. The state of general unrest (including an attempt to take the Lebanon by foi ce) was such thafde Jouvenal soon realised that events were too strong for him, and in October 1926 he was succeeded by M. Henri Ponsot. . . ^ „ 10 The first vear of his office M. Ponsot, who was no novice m Near Fastei nolitics wisely devoted to studying the complex problem which confronted him. French troops, released by the termination of the Riff campaign, ha\mg game the u d per hand of the rebellion, the resignation of the Damad m Febi uarv 1928 opened a new era. The time was now ripe for elections to be held for the - P rnn,Htnent \ssemblv ”-the first plank in the structure of the mandate. Sheikh Tai ed-Din, nominally a Nationalist (but with pro-French sympathies), Sheikh laj Minister The post of President was left vacant. In was appointed Po^.^i^, aU ations 0 f f tam pering, the Nationalists gained a t,pite of the &lt; ^ _|potions Sheikh Tai was confirmed as Prime Minister, sweeping. victory at th l t '„ ddressed (Llf to its appointed task, namely, Thl of hlmmenng ow a “institution.” A great deal of discussion andspeculation took place on the rival merits of a “ monarchy ” and a republic. The name of Emir Zaid was freely canvassed (amongst others) as a likely candidate for the “ throne.” but the Nationalists were definitely in favour of a “ President.” 11. The draft Constitution produced by the Assembly proved unacceptable to the French Government, being incompatible with the terms of the mandate^ and international agreements. Exception was taken to the following six^ articles: (1) Unity; (2) National army; (3) power of President to conclude treaties; (4) to receive Ambassadors; (5) to grant pardons; and (6) to declare martial law. The Assembly was invited to revise their draft accordingly, and, on their refusal to comply, was adjourned for three months, in the hope that wiser counsels would prevail. 12. The Assembly, having failed to come to terms, was finally adjourned sine die in February 1929. the Sheikh Taj Administration remaining in power. In August there were slight demonstrations in sympathy with the anti-Zionist movement in Palestine, but the country remained remarkably quiet. 13. In April 1930 Hashem Bey Atassi published a manifesto throwing the blame of failure to endow the country with a Constitution on M. Ponsot. The latter, in the following month, promulgated the Constitution drawn up by the Assembly, with the addition of a qualifying clause (article 116) vesting certain powers of veto in the French Government, in conformity with the latter’s obligations to the League of Nations. 14. In a decree published the same date dissolving the “ Constituent Assembly,” M. Ponsot pointed out that that assembly, in drawing up the Constitution, had completed their labours and complied with that part of the mandate which lays down that the views of the authorities and the population should be consulted in regard to the form of Government. 15. Towards the beginning of 1931, interviews published in the local press with Hashem Bey Atassi and Jamil Mardam Bey (at one time a super- Nationalist) suggested that the Nationalists, recognising that article 116 of the Constitution was merely a temporary safeguard pending the evolution of the mandate, were prepared to participate in parliamentary elections, as a first step to the negotiation of a treaty. But, whilst the serious leaders of “ nationalism ’ appeared to be gaining in wisdom and discretion, a new class of agitator—persons who had nothing to lose, but everything to gain, from disorder and violence—namely, the ” student-effendis.” found expression for their patriotism in their dissatisfaction with the price of electric tram fares, and the usurpation of the Hejaz Railway Station by a French-owned railway. They were sponsored by Emir Said Jazairly, an unbalanced megalomaniac, completely discredited by reasonable people. 16. For the first time on record, a group of Nationalists (including the type of ” condottiere,” such as Fakhri Baroudi) travelled to Beirut to welcome M. Ponsot on his arrival in November. Within a few days the latter accepted the resignation of Sheikh Taj-ed-Din, and assumed the functions of Chief of State. The air was cleared for the forthcoming parliamentary elections. A Syrian Secretary-General was appointed to administer the country with the aid of four Ministers of the previous Government. M. Ponsot declared that it was necessary, in order to conclude a treaty, to negotiate with a representative Government, in conformity with the Constitution, and held himself personally responsible for ” fair ” elections. 17. Just prior to the elections, skirmishes between hired “ bravos and the police were organised by certain Nationalists in order to raise a flagging “patriotism”; and, by convincing oratory, the mind of “the man in the street ” was poisoned, in advance, that the electoral proceedings would be faked from beginning to end. , 18. This form of “ mass-suggestion ” was bound to take eftect on an ignorant populace; and it was not surprising that certain allegations of “ tampering ” against one or two Syrian officials ended in scenes of disorder and bloodshed at the polls. The elections in Damascus were suspended, but on the same day, at Aleppo, the Liberal Constitutionals (or Moderates) swept the board the allegations of “ tampering ” have never been proved, and the matter was allowed to drop by the Commission of Enquiry set up by the new Parliament. 19 In spite of loose talk of a boycott by the Nationalists, the fresh elections at Damascus took place in March and April 1932, and resulted m the return of six Nationalists and three Model ates.20. In June 1932 Parliament was formally opened, and its composition was as follows :— Soubhi Bey Barakat was elected President of the Chamber, and Mohamed Ali Bey El-Abed President of the Republic. Hakki Bey El-Azm assumed the functions of Prime Minister, assisted by a Government of three Ministers, two of whom, including Jamil Marden Bey, are Nationalists. 21. On the return of M. Ponsot in October 1932, it became obvious that he and the French Government were anxious to negotiate a treaty with the representative Government in power; and, at his appearance before the Permanent Mandates Commission in December, the French policy in regard to Syria (as distinct from the Lebanon, and the other semi-autonomous “Governments”) was quite clearly defined; first a treaty, and then a period of evolution, pending entry into the League of Nations. The question of the future unification of Syria would not be a matter for immediate consideration. 22. M. Ponsot’s specific declarations at Geneva called forth a manifesto from Hashem Bey Atassi that the Nationalists would refuse to negotiate any treaty, which was not based on Syrian unity. Other influential members of the party, such as Fares Bey Khouri (who, in the past, has been exiled for the cause), expressed their opinion that the treaty, in itself, would be an excellent foundation for their further aspirations. On the other hand, telegrams were despatched to Geneva by delegations from the Alaouites and the Gebel Druse disclaiming the alleged aspirations of these districts for union with Syria.

Lord Tyrrell to Sir John Simon.—(Received April 5.) (No. 482.) Sir, Paris, March 31, 1933. I HAVE the honour to report that in the course of a debate upon the estimates for overseas defence which took place in the Chamber yesterday M. Daladier, President of the Council of Ministers, made a noteworthy speech in reply to a Socialist motion that the French mandate for Syria should be terminated. M. Sixte-Quenin, who was the principal Socialist speaker, had pointed out that Great Britain had terminated her mandate over Iraq, and urged that it was the duty of France from every point of view to do the same. He had claimed that the sacrifices, particularly in the monetary sphere, which France was being called upon to make in Syria were out of all proportion to the beneficial results which were being obtained. 2. M. Daladier, in his reply, said that France's mission in Syria was to bring the country to the point where political independence could be accorded to her, and it was that sole consideration which was shaping French policy in Syrian affairs. The situation differed entirely from that which obtained in the neighbouring country of Iraq. England had been able to grant independence to the latter on account of the homogeneity of the population, who had evolved in the course of centuries what might be called a collective conscience. In Syria, however, there existed an extensive variety, almost a mosaic it mi^ht be termed, of races and religions. Religious disputes always had a more serious aspect in Eastern than in Western countries, and religious difficulties in this case marched hand in hand with economic and ethical difficulties, all of which increased the task which faced the Administration. 3. M. Daladier recalled that in October 1932 M. Ponsot, the High Commissioner, had been instructed to begin negotiations at Damascus for the signature of a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Alliance, an indispensable preliminary to the admission of the new State into the League of Nations. The budget for Syria was certainly no light one, but he would observe that it had decreased by 34 millions since 1932 and by 68 millions since the year before that. To reduce it still further would be to run the risk of allowing serious internecine warfare to break out. If that happened, then either another Power would be forced to interfere, perhaps with no ultimate advantage to Syrian liberty or, alternatively, a large and costly expeditionary force would have to be sent from France. The Government were determined not to do anything in Syria to compromise the beneficial results which had already been obtained. 4. M. Daladier concluded by pointing out that France had scrupulously observed the engagements upon which she had entered with the League of Nations. Syria would as soon as possible take her seat at Geneva with her sister nations, but it was essential, particularly in the interests of the numerous units which made up the Syrian population, that the treaty of alliance should be signed first.

Consul-General Sir H. Satow to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 4.) (No. 9.) Si r Beirut, January 25, 1933. I HAVE the honour to report that, as part of the programme of reforms and economies in the Lebanese Administration, which is now being carried out b\ M. Charles Debbas, a number of inspectors-general, in two grades, with monthly salaries of £S. 170 and £S. ICjS, respectively, have been created. The existing Directorate of Economic Services has been suppressed. This branch will hence forth be attached to the Directorate of Agriculture, but^ in charge of an inspector-general (second grade). The Land Department (“ Services fonciers ”) also ceases to exist as a separate directorate. It remains attached to the Finance Directorate under an inspector-general. Henceforth, closer supervision and control of the inspectors of the Finance Directorate will be achieved by placing them in charge of a special inspector-general. 2. The theory that in future there will be only seven directorates, viz.. Interior, Finance, Public Health, Justice, Public Works, Education and Agriculture, seems a likely one. Rumour has it that when the promised reform of 1the Constitution takes place there will be only one Minister, known, perhaps, as Administrative Director. It seems not unreasonable to believe that in a minute State like the Lebanon, its head, with an assistant and a number of departmental chiefs; could comfortably administer the country, without any need of the costly paraphernalia of Parliament and Cabinet imposed by M. de Jouvenel. However that may be, reforms are presumably in preparation. M. Ponsot, who returned on the 6th January, is still here, and is not expected to leave for Damascus until the beginning of February.

Section 1. | E 6246/171/89] No. 1. Vice-Consul Napier to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 29.) (No. 71. Confidential.) Sir, Damascus, November 2, 1932. I HAVE the honour to refer to Mr. Hole’s despatch No. 47 of the 16th June, in which he reported the close of the first session of the first Syrian Parliament, and to inform you that, on the 29th ultimo, it reassembled for the October session, in the presence of the High Commissioner’s staff. 2. In accordance with a manifesto published a few hours before the hour the session was due to open, the members of the Nationalist party, with the exception of the two Ministers, abstained from attending. 3. The first day, as prescribed by the terms of the Constitution, was devoted to the election of officials; and, in the absence of the Nationalists, Soubhi Bey Barakat was re-elected to the office of President of the Chamber, with only one vote against him. It should be noted, as a commentary on parliamentary procedure in these countries, that all parties appear to attach considerable importance to this office, on the assumption that, by a judicious exercise of his prerogative, the “ Speaker ” can manoeuvre the proceedings of the assembly to the advantage of his own party. Whether Soubhi Bey is capable of these unseemly machinations I am not prepared to say. He was described in these despatches, in 1925, as a “ rather pitiful nonentity,” and “ deficient in intelli gence,” but, as recently as August 1932, a “ strong personality, quite capable of forming and maintaining an independent opinion.” I suspect that his opinion is guided, like that of most “ men of property,” by the identification of his own interests with the principles of law, order and security; whilst, as his past record would indicate, he is not entirely devoid of a sense of patriotism and a sense of proportion. 4. On the second day of the session (the 31st October), the stage was set, as Soubhi Bey himself informed me late the previous evening, for the Government to submit, according to the Constitution, to a vote of confidence. In order to assess the full importance (such as it is) of the events which succeeded the return of M. Ponsot, and the outcome of the second day of the session, it should be borne in mind that the Government, irrespective of the presence or absence of the Nationalists, and in spite of a divergence of opinion in the ranks of the moderates, was assured of a majority. The proceedings, however, opened (two hours behind schedule) by the Minister of Justice, one of the two Nationalist Ministers, calling on behalf of the Government for an adjournment, in order that they might submit a more definite programme than was possible for the moment. The motion was opposed by one Chaker Bey Shabani, nominally a “ moderate,” but actually a firebrand and an agitator, at variance with the majority of his party on purely personal grounds. It was seconded, however, by Maitre Faiz Bey Khouri, who appeared as the only renegade from his own (Nationalist) party, but clearly voiced the opinion of a number of his colleagues. His action obviously indicates a split in his party. Jamil Bey Mardam (the other Nationalist Minister) expressed the hope that the period of adjournment would enable the Government to insert as the main item in their programme a definition of the terms of the proposed treaty, which would conciliate the interests of all parties. 5. Such are the facts incidental upon the opening of a Parliament, which, in spite of an article in the Constitution laying down that the October session is to be devoted primarily to matters of public finance, was regarded by popular opinion as destined to lay the foundations of the independence of the country under the auspices of a treaty with the mandatory Power. 6. The Nationalists, at their meeting at S6far, reported bv Mr Urquhart in his despatch No. 83 of the 26th October, 1932, had sensed that M. Ponsot was anxious to serve up to the Mandates Commission at Geneva, where he is due on [627 ff—1]2 the 20th November, a report which would include something definite in the nature of a draft treaty with Syria. His losing no time in coming to Damascus, and his almost feverish haste in getting into touch, through the medium of the President of the Republic, with the leaders of public thought, not only confirmed these suspicions, but caused him to be regarded by the Nationalists in the light of a postulant. The-time at his disposal was extremely limited. The occasion, there fore, for the Nationalists to exert a form of blackmail was too good to be misse^^ 7. Their first move was to abstain from attending Parliament. Secondly— and this is much more important—they succeeded in extorting from M. Ponsot a letter in which he agreed to the proposed terms of a declaration to be made by the Government in regard to the treaty at the vote of confidence. The terms of this declaration were so explicit that they practically bound M. Ponsot to accept as a basis of the treaty, conditions at least as favourable as those accorded to Iraq. The Nationalists, having by this time gained solid ground for their belief that their immediate association with the Government was a matter of supreme importance to M. Ponsot, became even more arrogant in their demands, and again refused to take their seats in Parliament on the second day of the session. The High Commissioner may then have realised that he had made an error of judgment, and persuaded the Government to withhold the declaration which he had previously approved, pending further negotiations. 8. Thus, it would appear that M. Ponsot, by his somewhat obvious pandering to the Nationalists, has defeated the object of his too precipitate activities, and has succeeded in antagonising his nominal supporters, the “ moderates.” The latter, who cannot be expected to have those finer political perceptions observed only rarely in countries which have passed through a long evolution of parliamentary history, are naturally enquiring why, whilst holding a large majority, they should continue to be saddled with a Government of which two members out of the four are Nationalists, and be prevented, by the fractious bickerings of a small minority, from carrying on the business for which they were elected. 9. Whether M. Ponsot was actuated by motives of personal ambition, in the hope that, in achieving some concrete result, he would be rewarded forthwith with a post less inherent with unpleasant eventualities, or whether he was inspired by a desire of his Government to create at Geneva, and possibly elsewhere, an atmosphere less hostile than it would seem to be at present, is a question on which I am not competent to express an opinion. 10. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s Minister at Bagdad, His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Jerusalem, the British Resident at Amman, and His Majesty’s consular officers at Beirut and Aleppo.

NAPIER.(h*&gt;l (E 6462/171/89)• Daaasaue, November 8th» 19S2 Sir* In my iiamedlotely preceding de p&amp;loh No. 71 of To the 2nd Jiov ember, I had the honour to report on the event a which took place in Syria betwe«n the arrival of Monsieur onsot on the 21st October and the adjcurnsaent of Parliament on the 31st, and to point out that, in order to curry to a conclusion his desire to negotiate a draft treaty with a Gov^x'nnitfnt representative of all parties,Monsieur . onset was at pains to spare no effort to bring the Nationalists into the fold. 2. The latter- unlike their opposite numbers in Spypt- realising that a favourable atmosphere had been created for their particular benefit, and that they had everything to gain and nothing to lose by asserting their presence, decided to abandon their policy of passive ressiatance, and attended the adjourned meeting of parliament on the 5th November at full strength. 3. The Government programme, containing a short item in regard to the realisation of national aspirations and the conclusion of a treaty, the Nationalists, foregoing their previous demands for a specific definition of terms, supported the Government ns one man. 4. So far therefore, the policy of Monsieur Ponsot has been completely vindicated. By tact and cajolery he is now in a position to negotiate with a Government which has the support of all parties. 5 / - His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, etc., etc., etc. , etc., etc. foreign Office, S.w.1.5. To what extent the holding out of the hand of friendship to the extremist elements of countries legitimately strivin^ for a measure of self-determination is justified, is a question which contemporary hietroy does not appear to have solved. In this case the French may have oeen guided by considerations f&lt;*r wider than the comparatively unimportant question at immediate issue, in such circumstances, even e slight error in tactics - if error there were - would not only be justified, but might conceivably have been deliberate The attitude of the Syrian rationalists, in this Instance, will doubtless receive a measure of publicity, from the leading newspapers in Lgypt, whore national aspirations hove certain points of contact with those in Syria, it is with the greatest diffidence, however, that I venture to speculate on questions which are quite beyond the scope of my functions. 6. And now th*&lt;t two of the ingredients of th? mixture known as 'negotiation' hove been extracted, there remains the reagent, or auojeot matter. 7. according to the various Treaties and Pacts, it appears that France was entrusted with a mandate for two portions of the ex-Ottoman Kmplre known as yria and the Lebanon. Th re will doubtless be a thesis that in carving out the future of one of these t*o mandated territories, the exact geographical limits, as specified oy the original mandate must be scrupulously observed. To whfAt extent the reach tire able to counter that proposition, shoulu they wish to conteat it, or what support, if my, they can rely from any quarter primarily interested, I am not in a position o suggest. But the question of yrian Unity may well be an obstacle to a smooth and harmonious course of events.8.

Satow to Sir John Simon.—[Received December 3.) (No. 87.) WITH reference to Mr. Urquhart’s despatch JNo. &amp;3 ot ttie ^ntn uctooer relative to the return of the French High Commissioner, I have the honour to report that M. Ponsot left again yesterday for Geneva via Rome and Paris in order to present to the Permanent Mandates Commission his report on the situation in this mandated territory. Normally his report would only deal with the year 1931, but, as the commission did not this year meet in June, it will cover most of the year 1932 also. As stated in the official communique issued on the occasion of his departure, M. Ponsot, who is expected to be absent for a month or six weeks at the most, will take the opportunity to make known to the commission the result of his first contact with the Syrian Government, which, since the vote of confidence of the 5th November, is now constitutionally responsible. He will also attempt to forecast as to the political evolution of Syria and the terms on which a treaty with the Syrian Government can be made. 2. I saw M. Ponsot on the 21st, when I introduced to him Mr. Ogilvie- Forbes, Counsellor of His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad, who had arrived that morning and left later in the day for Damascus. M. Ponsot seemed to be in good health and spirits. He remarked that it was, on the principle that “ absence makes the heart grow fonder,” a good thing to leave his Nationalist friends at Damascus to their own devices for a time. The position would in future be simplified by the creation of two regimes only, that of a treaty and that ol a mandate. His remark presumably implies that there can be for some time at least no question of a treaty with the Lebanon, and that the coastal districts will continue to be administered under the mandaie. At present things are quiet in the Lebanon, and M. Debbas seems to be displaying unexpected energy in intro ducing economies and dealing with some of the worst abuses, such as the recent scandal in the Public Works Department. Possibly later some agitation for a treaty may manifest itself, as the winter and spring are seasons more propitious for local political activities than the hot weather. 3. As Mr. Urquhart remarked in his despatch, the Lebanon is at present a political backwater. The whole political staff of the High Commission has until the last day or so been concentrated at Damascus. M. Chauvel, the Political Director, has left with M. Ponsot for Geneva. M. Helleu. who has been left in charge, is to spend half the week in Damascus and the other half here. The High Commission offices in Beirut are now only occupied by officials who do not seem qualified to take decisions on their own initiative, and the chances of getting business put through quickly seem to be even smaller than in the past.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 347 of the 29th October last, I have the honour to report that my French colleague has been good enough to give me an account of the agreements which, as reported in that despatch, he has just signed with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and has undertaken to let me have the texts in due course. 2. The question of the “ biens syriens ” has been settled on the basis that Syrians are either to have their properties in this country restored to them, or, where that proves impossible, to be indemnified. In return, the restrictive measures which the Syrian and Lebanese authorities have hitherto applied to Turkish properties in Syria are to be removed, and the Turkish owners are to have full liberty to deal with the properties as they wish. Any disputes will be decided by a Franco-Turkish Commission, to which, in case of failure to agree, there will be added, so M. de Chambrun informs me, a neutral president selected by the President of the Swiss Federation. All this applies to “biens immo- biliers.” Claims for personal property will be dealt with by local jurisdiction, in the case of Syrians in Turkey by the Turkish courts, and, in the case of Turks in Syria and the Lebanon before the Mixed Franco-Syrian Courts, the terms of article 11 of the agreement assimilating them, for the purpose of prosecution of these claims, to French nationals. 3. As regards the railway, the agreement is recorded in a protocol. The intention is that the existing French management of the railway from Adana to Nisibin should be liquidated within twelve months, during which time an effort will be made to substitute a new form of exploitation whereby the present system of management would remain in force over so much of the line as lies in Syria, and a Turkish company would be formed with French capital to work the railway in Turkish territory, with the exception of the section from Adana to Fevzi Pasha, which will, in any case, be handed over entirely to the Turkish authorities within six months and be incorporated in the Turkish State railway system. The protocol lays down that all this is provisional, and that if on closer examination the scheme proves impracticable, some other solution will be sought. 4. I am not in a position to express any opinion as to whether such an agreement in any way prejudices the rights of the shareholders of the Bagdad Railway, though' I should imagine that, in any case, an agreement that ensures an efficient and possibly profitable exploitation of any part of the line should in practice be to their benefit. But M. de Chambrun is under the impression that the Turks and the French together hold the majority of the shares, and that, therefore, the two Governments could, if need be, call together the long- slumbering general meeting and obtain legal sanction for their proposals. 5.

The State of the Alaouites will naturally maintain its own Constitution, but the exact conditions do not seem to be quite definite.” 2. The Action franqaise of the 1st instant went further, and published a statement to the effect that the treaty had been signed. 3. In view of these rumours, which seemed to me highly fanciful, I took a recent opportunity of enquiring at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs whether there was any foundation for them. I was informed that the French Government were definitely embarked on the policy of emancipating Syria from the mandatory regime, but that it was impossible to say how long the process would take. It was necessarv first and foremost that there should be a Government in Syria with which the French Government could profitably deal. At present there was no kind of unison and much trouble was being created by the extremists; a further factor which did not tend to help matters, was the intrigues conducted by M • EASTERN (Syria).

Acting Consul-General Urquhart to Sir John Simon.—[Received November 5.) (No. 83.) Sir, Beirut, October 26, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that M. Ponsot, the French High Commissioner, arrived from Europe on the 21st instant, having broken his journey in Turkey. He did not come to Beirut. After a talk with M. Debbas, President of the Lebanese Republic, at Rayak, he proceeded direct to Damascus. He has summoned thither his secretary-general and the political Cabinet from Beirut, and clearly intends to concentrate on Syrian affairs. 2. It is generally understood that M. Ponsot has brought back with him proposals for a solution of the Syrian political situation. The case of Iraq is naturally prominent at the moment and is popularly held to impose on the High Commissioner an obligation to offer something approximating the satisfactory status now attained by that country. The inspired press does not evade this implication, but it stresses the comparative docility of the nationalists in Iraq and makes reserve for the intractability of Syrian Nationalists. France is represented as ready to treat Syria handsomely provided the Nationalists behave themselves. A meeting of these Nationalists at Sofar in the Lebanon about ten days ago discussed the situation which would arise on the High Commissioner’s return and there were some who suspected that France had no intention of treating Syria as Iraq has been treated; they thought that the High Commissioner would bring back some proposal quite inacceptabie to patriots like themselves (who have not l&gt;eeii successful in obtaining office) and that when they objected he would turn to the world at large, and the League of Nations in particular, and declare that Syria was still unfit to rise from her present position. The meeting decided to await the High Commissioner's proposals in a mood of some suspicion and in readiness to resume obstructive tactics if they proved unsatisfactory. 3. Negotiations are now proceeding, and progress will doubtless be reported to you in due course. The High Commissioner has begun at a great pace; if he can keep it up he may reach his objective, but if he finds that he must stop and bargain with all the niggling and contradictory interests in Syria he will again arrive at an impasse. Feeling is, however, optimistic here for the time being. 4. In these circumstances, the Lebanon is, for the time being, in a political backwater. The public, as a whole, appear to be perfectly satisfied with present political conditions; there is no demand for the restoration of a system of govern ment which has become entirely discredited because it cost so much and did so little, because also, as appears from an enquiry which has for some months been made into the doings of the Ministry of Public Works, it was extremely dishonest whenever opportunity offered. That Ministry naturally offered the best oppor tunities for the malversation of public funds. Rumours of fortunes made in a few years were investigated, after the suspension of the Constitution, and by degrees suspicion has crept higher up the line of officials, until it is approaching the Minister himself, some say that it ought to go beyond him to certain French officials, but there is perhaps a too great readiness to seek sensation by implicating the supreme authority. 5. Though tranquil politically, the economic situation of the Lebanon is still difficult. The programme of higher tariffs and protection for all local industries in the territories under French mandate is not altogether welcomed here, where so many live by handling imports from abroad. There is a good deal of distress among the common people which tends from time to time to express itself, for lack of other means, by violence. A determined attempt was made in the course of the summer to blow up the oil tanks of the Shell and Standard Oil companies, happily without success. It is unfortunate that the police have been unable to find the culprits. The fact is that what might be called the “ depressed [627 e—1]classes ' ’ here are so large and the held for suspicion so wide, that any one of many thousands might have adopted that method of protest. Nevertheless, discontent with economic conditions is still under the surface and M. Debbas will in all probability be perfectly able to fulfil the task said to have been allotted to him by M. Ponsot at Rayak on the 21st instant, of keeping the Lebanon quiet while the High Commission devotes its main energies to the Syrian problem. 6.

Section 1. E 522/226/89 No. 1. Consul-General Sir //. Satow to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 2.) Beirut, January 6, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that the ex-Khedive of Egypt reached Beirut from Turkey on the 22nd December and left for Palestine the following day. He returned to Beirut on the evening of the 2nd January and left again the next morning for Turkey. On his arrival he was accompanied by several persons, among whom were a French girl, a Hungarian painter, a Turkish official said to be a friend of Mustafa Kemal, and the ex-tutor of King Feisal and his elder brothers. Some of these persons dined at the Residency on the 22nd December, where there was a dinner of sixteen covers. On his return Abbas Hilmi, as M. Ponsot was to leave for Damascus early the next morning, dined quite quietly with the latter and Mme. Ponsot. On his return to his hotel about 10 o’clock he, according to a press report, had a long conversation with Mohamed Ali Bey-el- Abed, who came specially from Damascus to see him. 2. So far as I know these visits aroused little interest or comment in Beirut. The Damascus elections have been of absorbing interest to the Moslems, while the Christians have had to distract them the death and funeral of the Maronite Patriarch and the inevitable speculations as to his successor. 3. It was suggested to me to-day at the High Commission by M. Chauvel in the course of conversation that Abbas Hilmi’s original intention had been to go to Palestine at the time of the Moslem Congress organised by the Mufti, and that it was on that ground that he had obtained in Paris M. Ponsot's consent to his passage through Syria. Why he went after the congress was over, and whether his real intention was to visit Transjordan, as M. Chauvel seemed to think, I cannot of course say. I do not even know whether he visited the Emir Abdallah. My own personal opinion is that he did not come here in the capacity of a candidate for the Throne of Syria. So far as I can see the French are preserving an open mind on the question of monarchy versus republic, and are waiting until the situation in Syria becomes clearer either by the creation of a Parliament following on the conclusion of the elections or in some other way. As 1 understand it, the Nationalist leaders prefer a republic because it gives each one of them more chance of obtaining a share in the spoils of office. The French, too, might favour a republic, assuming that it would be easier for them, if necessary, to get rid of an obnoxious President than of an unsatisfactory Monarch. As for the mass of the people, it seems to be reasonable to believe that in an oriental country they would favour a King rather than a President. The former, as the father of his people, might possibly do something for them. The latter, with a brief term of office ahead of him, might reasonably be expected to do as much as possible for himself. One thing about Abbas Hilmi which would make him a desirable candidate from a popular point of view is that he is reputed to be extremely rich, so that he would not have to extract money from his subjects and might even expend some on them. Ex-King Ali, on the other hand, ' is believed to be quite poor, so that he would have to make his own living and could do little for his people. I have, &amp;c. IT.

During my last audience with King Fuad, His Ma jesty expressed his belief that the Turkish Government would welcome this contingency, and that view is now confirmed by the language held to me yesterday by Sidky Pasha. King luad had hinted to me that the ground for the attitude which he attributed to the Turkish Government might be that the latter foresaw the possibility of arranging with Abbas Hilmi. as King of Syria, a rectification of the Turco- Syrian frontier to their own advantage. Sidky did not allude to any such Turkish ambition. He thought, and I rather share his view, that the tone of the Turkish communication made by Shevki Bey was frank and open, and that the misapprehension of the Turkish Government in regard to Egypt’s attitude towards Abbas Hilmi’s candidature had been a genuine one.* It will be interesting to see whethei the Turkish Government alter that attitude in view of the exposition which they are now receiving of the attitude of the Egyptian Government.

The following information comes from a highly reliable source:- ' The Turkish Government are greatly concerned over the Syrian question and, more particularly, the proposal of the French Government to appoint King FEISAL of Irak as King of Syria. The Turkish Government regard FEISAL as an enemy notwithstanding the fact that he paid a visit recently to Angora. The Turkish Government are trying to find out the views of the Syrians on this proposal. As regards the Caliphate movement, the Turkish Government are not now so perturbed as they were. The Egyptians, Syrians and the Arabs under IBM SAUD are said to be against ABDUL MAJID's nomination and so, also, are some of the Indian leaders, such as the AGA KHAN and Sir M. SHAFI.

I HAVE the honour to report that Nuri Pasha, Prime Minister of Iraq, who during his stay in Angora for his treaty negotiations has freely associated with the Gazi, the Turkish Ministers and other leading Turks, most of whom are old friends of his, has informed me that the Turkish Government are closely watching events in Syria. They are hoping that the evolution of Syrian affairs may give them an opportunity of obtaining the cession to them of Alexandretta. It is their belief that France, which formerly abandoned to them Cilicia, may be induced to make this further concession. With regard to the internal constitution of Syria, Turkish statesmen dislike its division into numerous States, and especially the existence of the State of the Grand Lebanon. Although Nuri Pasha did not say so, I assume that the Turkish Government view with disfavour the existence of the Lebanese State because it destroys any hope of complete French withdrawal from Syria, a consummation which, as suggested passim in Mr. Morgan’s despatches Nos. 432 and 433 of the 23rd December, Turkey devoutly desires.

The Prime Minister has spoken to me again about the candidature of ex-Khedive to the throne of Syria. I am reporting by despatch and enclosing copies of letters exchanged between Turkish Charge d 1 Affaires and Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs on this subject which Prime Minister left with mo but it may be of interest to record meanwhile main points which emerged in conversation, 1. Egyptian Government have made it perfectly plain to the French Government that the presence of Abbas Hilmi on eventual throne of Syria would not be agreeable to them. 2. French Minister in Cairo has continued to express attitude of his government, as it has appeared in French communiques but hitherto orally only and not in writing. The French Minister has also explained to Sidki that the reception given to Abbas Hilmi by the French High Commissioner was one merely of courtesy due to his rank. 3. Egyptian Minister at^g^r^aJi^vj^^been invited to a reception by the Grand Visier in honour of....Cf ex-Khedive at which French Minister was also presen'o formed the conclusion that Turkish Government viewed Ahhas Hilmi's candidature favourahly. Sound ings were thereupon taken which showed that this diagnosis was correct. Thereupon Turkish Charg&lt;5 d’Affaires made a textual communication from his Minister for Foreign Affairs to Egyptian government admitting that Turkish government viewed Kilmi’s candidature with favour and hod had no grounds for supposing that Egypt would feel otherwise. Turkish government considered Abbas - Kilmi as a friend of Turkey and they had supposed that he would be welcome to Egypt as a member of Egyptian royal family. Turkish government nevertheless in view of their friendly relations with Egypt wished for a clear expression of views of Egyptian government especially as they had assumed Abbas Kilml had been acting hitherto in consultation and in agreement with the King cf Egypt and his government. 4, heply from Minister for Foreign Affairs shows that these assumptions s;ce unfounded; that Abbas Hilmi has been working entirely on his own account and indeed in contradict ion with understanding with Egyptian government that he should remain aloof from politics, and Sxplains reasons why it would create a disagreeable position for Egypt if an ex-ruler of this country and an ex-pretender to its throne, to whom moreover the Egyptian constitution denies access to Egyptian soil, were to become the monarch of neighbour staoo with which Egypt had closest ties of every description.

On the 30th the French Consul General in Jerusalem called on the Amir. Retold me that the French plan, after T , the elections have been carried out in January next, is if possible to conclude treaties with Syria and the Lebanon and to arrange that they should become members of the League of Nations. After that it would be a matter of indifference to the French whether Syria had a King or not, and who that King might be. He told me that Abbas Hilmi was amongst the candidates for the throne. The following day I asked the Amir how far he thought the French were likely to go in waiving their control over Syria. He said that they could not be expected to go any further than His Majesty’s Government had gone in their treaty with Iraq some years ago. He told me that the Hashimites, at any rate, would resist the choice of Abbas Hilmi as King. Loc&amp;l opinion, however, is that Amir would rather see Abbas Hilmi King of Syria than his brother Faisal, and that the Amir would not resist the appointment of Abbas Hilmi provided the latter could convince him that, by his influence and money,. Abdullah should ba made King of the Hedjaz. 13. If the French programme, as given by the Consul, is carried out and a King enthroned in Syria there would probably be a strong demand by the people of Trans-Jordan for unity with Syria. This presumably could not be allowed for Palestine’s hinterland must remain under our control and the pipe-line and Railway are important interests. The Amir would resist any such demand unless he were otherwise provided for to his satisfaction. It/It would seem that the alternatives to the above in regard to the future of Trans-Jordan merit early rr'* consideration. . x; Z r tIn any further communication on this subject, please quote No. £ b l 7 (cy \2.

Abbas Hiimi Pasha is a frequent visitor to Turkey, but his movements usually excite little oublic comment. For the st three weeks, however, he has been the subject of numerous allusions in the Press, which has recorded that he visited Angora on the 6th December and had a long Interview with Ismet Pasha; that, letter, he was received by the President of the Republic whom he first met, some twenty years ago, during the Turco- Italian war; and that, before his departure from Angora, on the 10th instant, fcu was the guest of honour at a nublic luncheon offered by Tevfik Bey in the Angora Palace, the Egyptian Minister being one of the guests. Finally it was announced that he left Constantinople by the laurus i xnrees on the 19th December (accompanied by /rif ; asha, Hasan Nasir Bey and Mahmoud Azmi Bey who is presumably the person referred to in oir P* Loraine’s confidential telegram No. 8 saving of the 29th November Sir With reference to your secret despatch No * to you), in order to visit Transjordan, at the invitation of The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.c etc etc I., K.C.V. 0 etc.of the iimir Abdullah, and that he would break his journey at Beirut, where he would be officially received by the French High Commis. ioner, and an official banouet would be given in his honour, and at Jerusalem where he would stay for some days. 3. The conclusion drawn by the Press is that Abbas Hilmi Pasha aspires to the throne of dyria and that his interviews at Angora had reference to his aspirations. Against this dre to be set Abbas Hilmi Pasha’s own denial that his journey has any connexion with the question of the - yrian throne, and a ddmenti of the French Ministry for Foreign Affairs, published on the 18th December by the Anatolian Agency, of the reports that Monsieur Ponsot and the French Government had approved the ex-Khedive’s candidature for the throne of dyria, and that a monarchy would shortly be established in that country. 4. It may be mentioned here that Abbas Hilmi Pasha was reported in the ’’don Posta” as having sent a telegram of congratulation on the occasion of the opening of the Moslem Congress. He has now denied this and added that although invited to the Congress he declined the invitation. 5. Turkey’s interest in the future of dyria is known, and, as mentioned in my despatch No. 432 of to-day, she would prefer a completely independent dyria to one wholly or partly under French control. She would, I think, not object to see Abbas Hilmi on the throne of dyria, as he could be counted on to be sufficiently pliant in her regard. It may be too that Turkey considers that Abbas Hilmi f sHilmi’s francophile sentiments will render him acceptable as a candidate, and will enable him to avert what Turkey considers a disagreeable probability, namely that Jyria will not be given independence as a whole, but will be divided into numerous states with each of which France will maintain the closest contact and relations.

Prime Minister informs me privately that he has questioned French Minister about reported support by French High Commissioner of candidature of ex-Khedive to throne of Syria. French Minister expressed his conviction that report was unfounded and his opinion that French Government and parliament would be opposed to having ex-Khedive as King of Syria; at Sidki's request French Minister is asking French Government ! s authority to give Sidki a definite assurance on the point and expects to secure it. Sidki has also ascertained that French Government would not favour candidature of King Feisul either. He gathers position to be that French have not invited candida tures but if they did these two particular ones would not be agreable to them. I am of course aware of semi official French denial which has appeared in the Press on both these subjects.

(ii) That for a single individual to hold the Crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in any case, be likely to prove unworkable; (iii) That any attempt by King Faisal to Transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests; (iv) That should the Crown of Syria be offered to ex-King Ali, no grounds exist for opposing his candidature. ?&lt;I R A .&lt;* Downing Street, ^■.ECRST 27th November, 1931.. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Major Young* s telegram No. 338 of the 14th of September and connected correspondence regarding the possibility of the establish ment of a monarchy in Syria, and the proposals reported to have been made by the French Government to King Faisal and his brother, ex-King Ali. 2. This question has now been carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government and their conclusions have been telegraphed to you in my secret telegram No.285 of the 21st November. As explained in that telegram, this statement of His Majesty’s Government’s views is for your own personal information and guidance only andnot for communication to King Faisal, ex-King Ali, or the Iraqi Government. It is, however, considered that, being in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Government, you will be in a position to advise and influence King Faisal and others in accordance with those views. 3. In considering the question of the future government of Syria, it is necessary first to define the term ’’Syria'. It seems clear that, when they use the term 'Syria' for the present purposes, the French Government mean the State of Syria only, excluding the Statps of the Alawites (Latakia) and the Jebel Druze, wh i ch HIGH COMMISSIONER LIEUTENANT COLONEL SIR F.H.HUMPHRYS G n v 0 _ &amp;C. , &lt;$CC. , &amp;c, ,which would remain, at any rate at first, under French military government. So far as concerns the Jebel Druze, it is believed that the French intend to retain control so long as His Majesty’s Government retain control of Trans-Jordan. It is also thought probable that the French Government intend to hold the Lebanon, which includes the important towns of Tripoli and Beirut, as long as His Majesty’s Government remain in Palestine, and there would, therefore, appear to be little prospect of the Lebanon being included in a Syrian Kingdom. 4. From information received from various sources there seems to be little doubt that the French Government’s attitude towards the question of establishing a monarchy in Syria has been gravely misrepresented by King Faisal. That the French Government are contemplating a change of policy in Syria is clear from the statement made by their Accredited Representative to the Permanent Mandates Commission in June last. This statement records the intention of the Mandatory to conclude with the Govern ments of Syria and the Lebanon in the near future treaties which will take into account the evolution which has taken place, and the progress which has been achived, in those territories. The statement appears on page 5 of the Commission’s Report to the Council of the League, a copy of which was sent to the Acting High Commissioner under cover of my predecessor’s miscellaneous despatch of the 10th of September. The exact nature of the impending change of policy is, however, difficult to forecast. What indications there are suggest that the treaties referred/?7 V referred to by the French Accredited Representative would be on the lines of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, and would entail the selection of a suitable person who would be proposed to the Syrians for election by plebiscite either as King or President. Nevertheless it seems likely that.while the French Government would be content to leave the Syrians to choose their own form of govern ment, either a monarchy or a republic, they have from time to time reviewed the merits of various possible candidates for the throne of Syria including those of certain members of the Hashimite family. 5. Whatever the intentions of the French Government may be, it is clear from Major Young* s Secret despatch of the 9th of October that, since his return to Ba^idad, King Faisal has shown that he regards it as settled that he is to be King of Syria as well as of Iraq, and that he is satisfied in his own mind both that the French Government have seriously made the proposal, and that His Majesty’s Government v/ould raise no objection. It is for this reason that it has been thought necessary to furnish you with an expression of the considered views of His Majesty’s Government. 6. So far as the interests of His Majesty’s Government are concerned, it v/ould be preferable that Syria should be a republic with a Syrian as President. In that case, the Syrians could develop their country in their own way, possibly on similar lines to Iraq, and would be free from the inevitable intrigues which would result from a connection with the Hashimite family, or - A / J forfor that matter,with the Royal Families of the Hedjaz-Nejd or Egypt. 7. If the Crown of Syria is offered to King Faisal, he will almost certainly wish to accept it, as he cannot be expected to resist the opportunity of returning to Damascus as king. It is not clear whether in this event the thrones of Iraq and Syria would be united, or whether King Faisal would transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria; but both events are undesirable. 8. Any attempt to unite the Crowns of Iraq and Syria would appear to be open to grave objection. King Faisal would probably reside in Syria, as that country has the better climate,and would leave a Regent in Baghdad. His position in Baghdad is already weak,and as the extent of Iraqi independence increased and British influence and support decreased, his position would almost certainly grow weaker and more difficult tomaintain The ultimate result might well be the subjection of Iraq to Syrian,and thus to French, influence and control. 9. There would also be grave objection to any suggestion that King Faisal should transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria. *f such a transfer were to take place, the result mig^it well be the usurpation of power in Iraq by the extreme Nationalist Party and the establishment of a republic. Relations between the future British Ambassador in Iraq and the Iraqi Government would be much more difficult if Iraq became a republic, than if it remained a monarchy. 10. For these reasons it seems desirable that King Faisal should be definitely discouraged from pursuing either'nr (S&gt; j either project, or from giving favourable consideration to any future overtures on the part of the French Government* 11. The same objections would not apply if the-choice of a King for Syria should fall on King Faisal’s brother, ex-King Ali. Ex-King Ali is, however, a weak character and it is difficult to forecast whether in the long run this solution of the problem would leave the predominating influence with King Faisal and ^-raq, or with Syria, and thus with the French,. However this may be, it is not easy to see how His Majesty’s Government could oppose the candiature of ex-King Ali, Moreover, if a monarchy for Syria is decided upon, a candidate will almost certainly be sought for from Egypt, Hedjaz-Nejd or Iraq, and, in that case, it might be in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that the choice should fall upon a candidate from Iraq. 12. The considered views of His Majesty’s Government may, therefore, be summarised as follows:- (i) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President: (ii) That for a single individual to hold the Crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in any case, be likely to urove unworkable: (iii) That any attempt by King Faisal to transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests: (iv) That should the Crown of Syria be offered tomZ- &gt; i to ex-King Ali, no grounds exist for opposing his candidature. 13.

CONFIDENTIAL. ; 82/ i Section 6 . gsT 5517/206/8frj— No. 1. Sir G. Clerk to the Marquess of Reading.—(Received November 9.) (No. 366. Very Confidential.) My Lord, Angora, November 2, 1931. ' HAVING waited for a hour at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs this after noon to keep an appointment made by the Minister, 1 decided that I had sufficiently complied with the requirements of official courtesy and returned home, leaving word that 1 had not liked to force myself on his Excellency, as he was apparently seriously engaged, but that I was at his disposal whenever he wished to see me.’ Shortly after I got back, I was rung up by Tevfik Rii§tu Bey with profuse apologies-for a staff error—his Excellency had never been told that I was waiting to see him—and an urgent request to receive him at once. I begged his Excellency not to bother, for the hour was late and there was no pressing need for an interview. However, the Minister insisted and arrived at eight o’clock. 2. I have seen Tevfik Riistii Bey excited and vehement, but I have never seen him so agitated as he was on this occasion. The cause of this agitation was, as I briefly reported to your Lordship in my telegram No. 65 of to-day, that he had just received confirmation of an offer of the throne of Syria by the French Government to King Feisal, which offer it seemed probable that His Majesty would accept. I asked the Minister if he was quite sure of all this, of which I d seen vague reports in the press, for to me it seemed that King Feisal would be kept busy enough in Iraq without adding the problems of Syria to his burden. Tevfik Ru§tu replied that King Feisal in Bagdad had admitted having received the offer and had said that his acceptance depended upon a satisfactory settle ment of the conditions attaching to it, while it was a fact that when the King was in Paris M. Berthelot had, at some banquet in his honour, drunk a toast to the King of Iraq and Syria, which His Majesty had accepted sub silentio. 3. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then launched forth. He said that he was in despair over French policy in Syria—or rather, it was not the policy cf France or even of the French Government, but of M. Berthelot, and, at the back of M. Berthelot, the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, otherwise M. Finaly. It was not the first time that M. Berthelot and banks had worked together, and the precedent had not been a happy one. His Excellency had no objection, per se, to a union of Iraq and Syria under one head, nor indeed to an Arab union, provided that the conditions in Syria were the same as they were in Iraq, where our position caused the Turkish Government no anxiety at all. We had been perfectly straightforward in our dealings with Turkey as regards Iraq, and he recognised that, with our commitments in India and the East, Iraq must have a definite political interest for us. But we had left, or were about to leave, Iraq to full independence and the Iraq frontier would be defended by Iraq soldiers. That was far from being the case in the proposed arrangement about Syria. There,, the Fiench troops and French administration were to remain, and King Feisal would merely be a means of extending French influence into Asia. Turkey was at peace with all her other neighbours and on the best of terms with them. The best proof of how secure she felt in the good intentions of the neighbouring countries was that on the frontiers contiguous to Greece, Bulgaria, Russia and Iraq there were no soldiers, nor were there any on the coast facing the possessions of Italy, while those that were maintained on the Persian frontier were solely there, not for fear of any aggression on the part of Persia, which was out of the question, but, he was sorry to have to admit, because of the weakness of the Persian administration Only opposite the Syrian frontier did the Turkish Government feel any nervousness, and in that region Turkey was obliged to maintain from two to three divisions. Turkey was as friendlily disposed to France as to any other Power, but the Minister felt that France could not forgive Turkey for refusing to become, at least in spirit, a member of the Little Entente. Turkey for her part was determined to have no entangling alliances. She only sought [316 i—6]2 to live at peace with ail the world and to develop herself as a cultured and civilised European State. She had definitely cut loose Irom Asia. There was a time when she had thought of playing a role in Afghanistan, but she had been let down and his Excellency had never been more thankful than when he had safely extricated the Turkish Military Mission and his other nationals from the mess made by~. Amanullah. From that time Turkey’s eyes were fixed on the West, and she w&lt; so good a European that he w-as prepared to welcome the extension of the Inter national Straits Commission to the whole of the Black Sea, while he made no secret of his wish that Turkey should join the League of Nations, as he had just told M. Litvinoff. The Soviet Commissary had replied that while Moscow t con sidered that Turkey was wrong, she was an independent country and was free to decide as she thought best. (This is interesting as corroborating the reasons for M. Litvinoffs dissatisfaction with his visit suggested in my despatch No. 361 of the 1st instant.) Turkey was, moreover, an upholder of Europe as it was to-day. Theoretically, she might, share some of the misgivings about the sanctity of the Treaty of Versailles, but she was above all a realist in her policy, and she W'Ould never take an active part in upsetting the treaty. But neither would Turkey consent to be the “gendarme” of Versailles. Perhaps that was why France made things so difficult. His Excellency vms frankly at a loss to know what France was aiming at in the Near East. He only knew that he wms filled with anxiety by this latest development. Had he got to guard against an eventual move on Cilicia, or had he to expect French political penetration through Syria and Iraq into Asia? If the invitation to Feisal had no sinister basis, why had Turkey been kept in the dark and left to find out what w as happening by herself ? 4. The Minister talked for over an hour with more than his usual volubility, and I have tried to give your Lordship the gist of his observations, but I cannot pretend to complete accuracy. His Excellency made no direct request, and seemed to be using me more as an outlet for the expression of his feelings than for any thing else. None the less it wms obvious that he hoped for some assurance from us, either that Feisal would not accept the throne of Syria except on conditions analogous to those in Iraq, or that we were confident that France had no ulterior aims when extending the invitation to the King. 5. Tour Lordship wall doubtless instruct me in due course as to the line you wish me to take if and when Tevfik Riistii recurs to the subject, but it is clear that it will not be easy to eradicate the intense suspicion which the Turkish Government feels towards French policv in Syria, or perhaps I should say which Tevfik Ru§tu feels towards M. Berthelot and the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas. I have ahvays considered that the Ottoman Bank, or rather the French Board, have underestimated not only the determination of the Turkish Government to avoid submission to French financial control in any shape or form, but also the power of Turkey to retain her independence. The attitude of the bank has been that it has only got to sit tight and sooner or later the Turkish Government will be bound to come to it on bended knees for the wherewithal to carry on. This I believe to be an entire misreading of the situation, but it seems to have inspired the policy of the bank from the start, and the feeling that this is the bank’s policy lies to my mind at the root of much of the uneasiness displayed in Tevfik Rii^tii Bey's outburst. 6. My French colleague, w T ho usually talks to me very openly of his relations with the Turkish Government, so far as they have an interest for us, has not said a^ word on this matter of the Syrian throne, and as his Excellency is in Constantinople at the moment I shall have no opportunity of any discussion with him for some little time. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE R, CLERKpolicy of His Majesty’s 'Government in regard to the possible establishment of a Monarchy in Syria (MoE.

(ii) That for a single individual to hold the Crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in any case, be likely to prove unworkable; (iij) That any attempt by Xing Faisal to transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests; (iv) That should the Crown of Syria by offered to ex-King All, no grounds exist for opjjosing his candidature.M \ •• o?s *v (THIS DOCIM S ECRET.

Possible Establishment of a Monarchy by the French in Syria, and Future Policy thereon. Memorandum prepared by the Standing Official Sub-Committee. 1. On the 20th October, 1931, the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East met to discuss the possibility of the establishment of a monarchy in Syria and the proposals reported to have been made by the French Government to King Faisal of Iraq and his brother, Ali, ex-King of the Hedjaz. 2. In March 1920, at the time of the Arab revolt against the French Administration in Syria, the Emir Faisal (now King Faisal of Iraq) was proclaimed King of a united Syria. The French Government were not slow to reject this solution of the Syrian problem, and an ultimatum to the Arab Government was followed by an advance into the interior of Syria and by the flight of the Emir Faisal. 3. Although the Mandate for Syria, which is described as “ a Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon,” did not effectually come into force until December 1923, the existing regime may be considered to have commenced with the French advance into the interior of Syria in July 1920. At the present time the States of the Levant under French mandate consist of the following :— The State of the Lebanon. The State of Syria (including the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta, a province of the State of Syria). The State of the Alawites (or the State of Latakia). The State of the Jebel-Druze. These States enjoy varying degrees of independence, but may be divided into two groups, namely, the States of the Lebanon and Syria, which have elected Presidents and Constituent Assemblies, and the States of the Alawites (Latakia) and the Jebel-Druze, which have Governors nominated by the French High Commissioner. 4. For some time past, there has been reason to believe that the French contemplate a change of policy in Syria, and this belief has been justified by a statement made to the Permanent Mandates Commission at their 20th Session in June 1931 by the French Accredited Representative. This statement is described in the Commission’s report as follows :— “ It (the Commission) recorded the Mandatory Power’s intention of concluding in the near future treaties with the Governments of Syria and the Lebanon, taking into account the evolution which has taken place and the progress which has been achieved. The accredited representative informed% \ ✓ •2 it that the present process of evolution pointed to the termination of the mandate for Syria and the Lebanon at a not very distant date, and that, consequently, the Treaty to be concluded with the Governments of those countries would relate not only to the carrying out of the Mandate, but to its replacement by a new regime. While it is not clear what are the exact intentions of the French Government, it is probable that the proposed treaties would be on the lines of the Treaty concluded by His Majesty's Government with Iraq in 1922. This would entail the selection of a suitable person who would be proposed to the Syrians for election by plebiscite either as King or President. It is difficult to arrive at a definite conclusion as to the French Government s views on the question of a suitable ruler for Syria, since the information in the possession of His Majesty's Government rests on unofficial expressions of view and reported conversations. It seems likely, however, that, while the French Government are content to leave the Syrians to choose their own form of Government, namely, a monarchy or republic, they have from time to time reviewed the merits of various possible candidates for the throne of Syria if a monarchy is eventually decided upon, including those of certain members of the family of the late King Hussein. 5. The history of the various demarches in this direction is mainly derived from King Faisal. So far as it refers to overtures to King Faisal on the part of the French Government, or vice versa, the course of events may be summarised as follows :— At an interview with M. Berthelot in November 1925, King Faisal was asked for his advice as to how the Syrian question should be dealt with. The King advocated a constitution similar to that instituted in Iraq by His Majesty's Government, and subsequently asked for His Majesty’s Government's approval of what he had said. A reply was returned to the effect that the question of a ruler for Syria was a matter which concerned the French Government alone and in which His Majesty’s Government could not intervene or even express an opinion, unless specifically asked to do so by the French. In the spring of 1928 emissaries of King Faisal enquired of the French High Commissioner in Beirut whether a member of King Faisal’s family would be regarded with favour by the French as a candidate for the throne of Syria, and were informed that if a member of the King's family were to be a candidate, the matter would become an international one and must be referred to Paris. Thereupon King Faisal asked His Majesty’s Government, through the High Commissioner in Baghdad, to ascertain privately from the French in Paris what their intentions were. Discreet enquiries were made of M. Berthelot, whose views were reported to be that the French Government would not at that stage entertain any suggestion for the selection of a member of the Hashimite family Early in 1930 a semi-official report was received from Palestine that the French were again looking out for a King for Syria, that they had three candidates in mind, and that one of them was ex-King Ali. Efforts in Paris to confirm this report elicited the unofficial information that, while the French were looking for a solution of the Syrian problem, it had not reached the stage of deciding for a monarchy. In January 1931 the High Commissioner at Baghdad reported that the French Charge d’Affaires had been sounding both King Faisal and himself as to the kind of conditions which any prospective candidate for the throne of Syria would be likely to impose before he agreed to become king, and that King Faisal had sought the High Commissioner’s advice in the matter. In making this request the King had expressed the view that ex-King Ali should not enter into any relations with the French Government until a clear statement of French policy had been made and a definition had been given of what was meant by the term Syria. A reply was returned to King Faisal’s request for advice to the effect that His Majesty’s Government agreed with his views, but it was impressed upon him again that the question of the choice of a king or government for Syria was the concern of the French Government only. for the Syrian throne. In view of this, King Faisal was advised not to press the matter.6. Up to this point the only members of the Hashimite family who were mentioned as candidates for the throne of Syria had been King Faisal’s brothers, namely, the Emirs Abdullah and Zeid and ex-King Ali; but the King himself has now appeared as a candidate. In September of this year King Faisal had another interview with Berthelot in Paris, wdiich he described orally to the High Commissioner for Iraq, Sir Francis Humphrys. According to this account, M. Berthelot is reported to have said that, while they wished to leave the choice of a ruler to the Syrian people, the French would welcome Faisal's return. King Faisal asked Sir Francis Humphrys to report this conversation in London, and to advise him as to his proper course of action. Although it seems probable from informal conversations which have since taken place between Sir Francis Humphrys and M. Ponsot, the French High Commissioner for Syria, &amp;c., that the French attitude in this matter has been gravely misrepresented by King Faisal, the fact remains that since his return to Baghdad the King has shown that he regards it as settled that he is to be King of Syria as well as of Iraq, and that he is satisfied in his own mind both that the French Government have seriously made the proposal and that His Majesty’s Government would raise no objection. Active propaganda in support of his candidature is being carried out in Syria and considerable interest in the matter is being evinced by the Moslem population of Syria. 7. These events and the inevitable rumours which have accompanied them have given rise to anxiety on the part of the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq, who has asked urgently for advice as to what attitude he should adopt. No definite reply has yet been returned to this enquiry, but it is desired to furnish Sir Francis Humphrys with an expression of the considered views of His Majesty’s Government on his arrival in Baghdad on return from leave in the middle of this month. 8. It is first necessary to define the term “ Syria ” as used in the present connection. In a private conversation with Sir Francis Humphrys, M. Ponsot has made it quite clear that for the present purposes the term ‘ ‘ Syria ’ ’ might be taken as meaning the State of Syria only, excluding the States of the Alawites (Latakia) and the Jebel Druze, which would remain, at any rate at first, under French military government, and so far as concerns the Jebel Druze, it is believed that the French intend to retain control so long as His Majesty’s Government I retain control of Trans-Jordan. As to the Lebanon, which includes the important towns of Tripoli and Beirut, this is a Christian enclave, inhabited by a mixture of races where French influence has been predominant since 1860, and it is thought probable that the French intend to hold the Lebanon as long as His Majesty’s I Government remain in Palestine; there would, therefore, appear to be little &gt; prospect of the Lebanon being included in a Syrian Kingdom 9. There seems to be no doubt that so far as the interests of His Majesty's Government are concerned, it would be preferable that Syria should be a republic with a Syrian as President. In that case, the Syrians could develop their country in their own way, possibly on similar lines to Iraq, and would be free from the inevitable intrigues which would result from a connection with the Hashimite family, or, for that matter, with the Royal Families of Hedjaz-Nejd or Egypt. 10. If the Crown of Syria is offered to Faisal, he will almost certainly wish to accept it, as he cannot be expected to resist the opportunity of returning to Damascus as king. At present, there is little or nothing to show whether in this event he would attempt to unite the thrones of Iraq and Syria, or would transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria; but both events are undesirable. 11. Any attempt to unite the Crowns of Iraq and Syria would appear to be open to grave objection. Faisal would probably reside in Syria, as that country has the better climate, and would leave a Regent in Baghdad. His position in Baghdad is already weak, and as the extent of Iraqi independence increased and British influence and support decreased, his position would almost certainly grow weaker and more difficult to maintain. The ultimate result might well be the subjection of Iraq to Syrian, and thus to French, influence and control. 12. There would also be grave objection to any suggestion that King Faisal should transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria. If such a transfer were to takeplace, the result might well be the usurpation of power in Iraq by the extreme Nationalist Party and the establishment of a republic. Relations between the future British Ambassador in Iraq and the Iraqi Government would be much more difficult if Iraq became a republic, than if it remained a monarchy. 13. For these reasons it seems desirable that King Faisal should be definiti : discouraged from pursuing either project, or from giving favourable considera-' tion to any future overtures on the part of the French Government. 14. The same objections would not apply if the choice of a King for Syria should fall on Faisal's brother, ex-King Ah. But Ali is a weak character and it is difficult to forecast whether in the long run this solution of the problem would leave the predominating influence with King Faisal and Iraq, or with Syria, and thus with the French. However this may be, it is not easy to see how His Majesty’s Government could oppose the candidature of ex-King Ali. Moreover, if a monarchy for Syria is decided upon, a candidate will almost certainly be sought for from Egypt, Hedjaz-Nejd or Iraq, and, in that case, it might be in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that the choice should fall upon a candidate from Iraq. 15. After careful consideration of all the aspects of the question, the Official Sub-Committee recommend that Sir Francis Humphrys should be informed that the considered views of His Majesty's Government are as follows :— (i) That the outcome most likely to be to the advantage of His Majesty's Government would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President: (ii) That for a single individual to hold the Crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable, and would, in any case, be likely to prove unworkable : (iii) That any attempt by King Faisal to transfer his Crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests : (iv) That should the Crown of Syria be offered to ex-King Ali, no grounds exist for opposing his candidature. 16. It would be understood that this statement of the views of His Majesty’s Government is for Sir Francis Humphrys’s guidance and not for communication to King Faisal or others; but Sir Francis Humphrys, being in possession of the views of His Majesty’s Government, could advise and influence King Faisal in accordance therewith. 17. It is requested that the Ministerial Sub-Committee will give early con sideration to this question, as Sir Francis Humphrys is most anxious to receive advice in the matter.

Very confidential, for your own information. There have been rumours that French contemplate establishing monarchy in Syria and offering throne to King Feisal or other member of hashimite family. And Feisal apparently under impression that he is to be offered throne, has actually been carrying on propaganda through agents in Syria in support of his ov/n c and idatur e. But high Commissioner for Iraq when in Paris was recently informed most confidentially by French High Commissioner for Syria that French attitude had been gravely misrepresented by Feisal who had exaggerated cordial reception by French government in Paris into official declaration that they were prepared to accept him as King of Syria.

Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform you that His highness the Amir has been greatly disturbed by certain statements which His Highness asserts were made by His Majesty King Faisal end by members of His Majesty’s suite when they were at Amman to the effect that during their recent visit to Europe they conducted negotiations with the French Government and some Syrian leaders (notably Emir Shekib Arslan) with the result that it was practically settled that Faisal should become King of Syria and Iraq. 2. Kis Highness also points out that a number of articles have recently been published in the Arabic Press in Palestine and Syria on the same subject and that at least one of these articles, which appeared in 'Falastin' , was based on statements made by Rustum Haidar, the Iraqi Minister of Finance. 3. His Highness the Amir feels that he will be placed in an extremely difficult position if His Majesty King Faisal's alleged ambition is fulfilled and he is most anxious to ascertain whether or not His Majesty's Government have any knowledge of such an agreement having been made between Faisal and the French Government and to ascertain if possible the attitude adopted in the matter by His Majesty's Government.

This letter is written on the subject of our recent conversation at Amman in order that there may exist no misunderstanding between us. I originally advised our brother King Ali to have nothing to do with the movement to place a King over Syria before coming to an agreement with the Mandatory Power (Great Britain) but he disregarded my advice and negotiated with Lepissier and others with the result that parties hostile to him have been formed in Syria, I understand that you received a letter from the French Authorities to the effect that if it could be arranged for the pipe-line to end at Tripoli they would agree to a solution of the Syrian problem acceptable to the Iraq. This letter also invited you to visit France. You first went to Switzerland where you met Ghekib Arslan and other Syrians who informed you that Ali f s cause was weakly supported in Syria and that if there was to be a King in Syria it should be yourself in accordance with the declaration made by the first Syrian Parliament in 1919. To all this you replied in a manner which showed that the proposals were not unacceptable to you. You also went to Paris where the French told you that any member of the family (Hashimite) would be acceptable. Then you informed me of the foregoing I pointed out that the Union cf Iraq and Syria would raise the question of Trans-Jordan forming a part of Syria and youreDlied that that would come latero I thus rea?uiseO. your intentions regarding Tr-unS'-Jcrdan and I v.ou.d remind you of your letter to me written at the time you ascended the Iraq throne to the effect that no one was left for Syria other than myself&lt;&gt; T desire to draw your attention to the following considerations;- (a) The Arab revolt was based on one policy and one King and when your army entered Syria it occupied that country ano. j. ormeo. a Government in the name of Hussein 5 King oi the Arabs ^ ano. your message to that effect still exists*.

If on the other hand you are doing this for your own glory and advancement, I consider that you already possess enough to make it unnecessary for you to gain more at the expense of the rights of others.

Satcw, His Majesty’s Consul General at Beirut, dealing with the activities of Rustam Haidar, the Iraqi Minister of Finance, who, during a recent visit to the Lebanon, which was his native country, had indulged in Keen propaganda on behalf of King Feisal’s candidature for the Syrian throne. Sir H. Satow had enclosed an extract from a French-Syrian paper, which had clearly indicated the French views on the whole question. It was decided that these papers should be circulated to the Sub-Committee, (this had now been done (see M.E.(O) 33) . SIR FRAHCIS HUMPHRYS eaid that he had discussed this matter with M. Ponsot, ihe French High CommissioneriM, Ponsot &amp; in Syriadur his recent visit to Paris, had said that the French attitude had been gravely misrepresented by King Peisal ; who had given, as usual, pull range to his imagination and exaggerated a cordial and friendly reception by the French Government into an official declaration that they were prepared to accept him as King of Syria, Such a statement M, Ponsot declared was entirely fantastic,, M. Ponsot had pointed out to him that when ex-King All had invited himself tc Beirut in 1G30 a similar rumour had been spread abroad. The present reports circulated about King Feisal made it appear that the French Government had informed him that he had merely to present a formal claim in order to receive the throne of Syria, Nothing could be more grotesque than these rep .re sent at i on s „ LU Ponsot had said that ov/ing to these rumours and the embarrassing situation caused thereby, he would be unable to pay a visit to Sir Francis in Baghdad, which he had promised to make next March in return for Sir Francis* visit to Beirut in April, 1931, Sir Francis Humphrys' own view was that the French had rather gone out of their way to make themselves agreeable to King Feisal, in order to make him believe that the interests of Syria and Iraq were identical over the difficult questions of the boundary and the pipeline. He thoughb that the French had formed no definite opinion on this question. In the first place it would be necessary to alter the existing Constitution of Syria, and it would then be for the Syrians to select a ruler, subject, of course, to the selected candidate being regarded as suitable by the French*The people of Syria could he divided into two parties* the intelligentsia, who would expect to get more personal posts, power and influence under a President than under a King, and who would therefore prefer a republican form of Government; and those not directly interested in the Government of the country, v.ho, on the grounds of religion and tradition, would prefer a Monarchy. In any case the French would almost certainly look for possible candidates in mgypt and Nejd as well as Iraq before a decision was reached* King Feisal^ s assumption that the throne would be offered to him was quite unjustified« Sir Francis Humphrys considered that the practical difficulties which would arise if Feisal became King of Syria as well as of Iraq would be insuperable* The K:ng would probably reside in Syria, as it had the better climate, and would leave a Regent In Baghdad* He would probably spend but little time in Baghdad, where his position is already rather weak* Moreover, as the extent of Iraqi independence increased and British influence and support decreased, his position would grow weaker and more difficult to maintain* He considered that Feisal’s vanity would not allow him to forego the opportunity of returning to Damascus as King, if such an opportunity came his way* The advice he would like to give King Feisal was that it would be impossible for him to rule over both Syria and Iraq. He would also be opposed to any suggestion that King Feisal should transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria. If such a transfer were to take place the result might well be the usurpation of power in Iraq by the extreme nationalist party and the establishment of a republic. Relations be— tween the future Ambassf dor in Iraq and the Iraqi Government would be much more difficult if Iraq became a republic than if it remained a monarchy. -3-&gt;*9 &amp; On the other hand, if ex-King Ali were invited to become King of Syria it might he advantageous to uc, though Ali v;as a deplorably v/oah character and would be unduly under the influence of his brothere In hie opinion the establishment of a Republic in Syria was more probable than that of a Monarchy; in that event a President would probably be found from among the Syrians themselves* If a Monarchy vi/as decided upon, a candidate would be sought either from Egypt, h'ejd, or Iraq 0 In that case it would presumably be in the interests of His Majesty’s Government that the choice should fall upon a candidate from Iraq.* MR. RENDER said that it would probably be difficult to find a candiate from Nejd ? where anyone of sufficient character and standing to fill the bill v/as too badly needed to be spared for a foreign throne. MR. PARKINSON thought that the views of Sir Francis Humphrys generally coincided with those of the Colonial Office* He asked Mr* Rendel what were the views held by the Foreign Office. MR. RENDER said that in so far as King Feisal’s candidature was concerned, the question under consideration was extremely hypothetical* It was significant that, except for what had recently passed between Mo Ponsot and Sir Fe Humphrys in Paris, practically all the information had emanated from King Feisal himself, and that the present propaganda in Syria was apparently due to King Feisal’s direct initiative. Generally speaking, however, the views of the Foreign Office were the same as those which had been expressed by Sir F* Humphrys. The Foreign Office would regard any attempt to combine the Crowns of Syria and Iraq as open to the gravest objections and dangers. Apart from the impracticability of such a scheme, to which Sir Fo Humphrys had already drawn attention, from theconfusion which it would cause, and from the difficulties which would, follow on the inevitable absenteeism of King Feisal from one, if not both, of his kingdoms, the ultimate result could only be the subordination of Iraq to Syrian, and thus eventually to French, influence and control. The Foreign Office view was that if King Feisal asked for advice, he should be told that while he must take the eventual decision on his own responsibility, His Majesty T s Government, so far as they were concerned, could not view the proposal otherwise than with the gravest misgiving. It seemed desirable in fact that King Feisal should be strongly discouraged from pursuing the project. GitOUP-CiPlAlN PMIHSE stated that the Air Ministry fmiuediatdl^.. concerned-, oo—long- as .the.. ssourr-l^y-^nd independence -o-f /iraq and Trans-Jordan -were onioquat oly—assure d. MH. HMNDEL enquired whether a union between Syria and Iraq would be a practicable preposition on geographical and administrative grounds, even if it were not undesirable politically? -as net the natural orientation cf the two territories entirely distinct? SIP: FRANCIS HUMPHRYS replied that it was necessary first to define Syria. M. Ponsot had made it clear in his private conversation that the French regarded the State cf Syria, for present purposes, as consisting of tne districts of Damascus and Aleppo only. The States of the Alaouites and of the Jebel Druzc would certainly net be included for the present in any Syrian kingdom, but would be regained under French military government. Sir Francis Humphrys considered, however,45s -6- that if the Crown of this restricted ■■■■ to if Syria were offered king keisal, His tlajesty would either refuse it, or he accepted it, indulge in unlimited intrigue in order to acquire the excluded areas, in which event the French would probably turn him out. The State of the Lebanon, as it now existed, aiffered from the pre-war Lebanon, and included the Ports of Beirut and Tripoli, which in pro war cities had not been Lebanese, The Lebanon is a Christian enclave inhabited by a mixture of races where French influence has been predominant since 1860, Sir Francis Eumphrys thought that the French intended to hold on to the Lebanon as long as we remained in Palestine, and to retain control of the Jebel Druze as long as we retained control of Trans-Jordan. tkd PIFKINSGN in summing up the feeling of the meeting said that it was not e practicable or desirable proposition lor Feisal to assume the Kingdom of Syria, lllh ESN DEL enquired whether the same dangers might not exist if the choice should fall on ex-King Ali, Eight not Syrian influence in such an event similarly tend to spread into Ira'p, and might not the family connexion thus established be followed by a political connexion? He recognised, however, tnat it would be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to interfere. EXE FhAhClS IfdiuKEYS thought that the situation could be summed up as follows - it was preferable that there should be a Republic in Syria with a local man as President. This would mean that the Syrians would develop the country forthdiHGelvey on siriiiiar lines to Iraq,, and would endeavour to gain independence as one complete and united State. During recent negotiations with Iraq he had quoted the analogy of Egypt and the Sudan and thus played on the fears oi the Iraqis lest the districts of Basra in the south or Kurdistan in the north should become potential Sudans tor Iraq* In Syria tncre were two^ it not tiiree^ potential Sudans, i.e., tne State of the ala suites, that of the J ebel Bruze, and the autonomous sanjak of Alezandretta. It would be the main object cl any royal ruler of Syria to amalgamate tnese into a single State If there was to be a Monarchy in Syria, he could not say whether ex-Kang Ali was the most suitable candidate. There might be other bettor cenaidatos. He was convinced, however, that His Majesty’s Government would net be able actively to oppose Ali’s candidature. The proposal tnat King Deisal should have the thrones of both Syria and Iraq was impracticable and snould be o pposed. GHOUr-Cx T P f id*i:N HEIIiSE asked whether the French proposed to conclude a Treaty with Syria on the same lines as that which has recently been concluded between His Ma jesty ’ s Government and Ii‘aq« bln FRJSCIS HUMPitirfS was of opinion tnat the Treaty proposed by the French would be similar to the Treaty concluded by His Majesty’s Government with Iraq in 1922, and net to that concluded in 1930. The French had no intention, he tnought, at present, o^ granting tno Svrians the measure of independence provided for in the Anglo-Iraq Treaty cf 3930. Mx-v. HEN BEL asked whether King Ali and King Foisal might not leave a joint heir.■■■ SIR 5“ CIS HUMiiiRYS sciid that both kings were rather badly off for heirs. Kin# Foisal had a sen who had been educated in England, but who did not count for much, MR. RENTER thought tnat King Fcisal might be exploiting tho idea of the Syrian throne with a view to having something to fall back on in case of trouble in Iraq. In his view a new light had been thrown on the whole question by M. lensot’s remarks to Sir J. liumphrys. The possibility of a member of the Hashimite family coming to the throne of Syria now appeared much more remote than before, SIR FRANCIS HUMPHRYS said tnat he wished to obtain the official views of His Majesty’s Government on this question which was bound to be brought up when he returned to Baghdad in November, He did not, of course, propose to tell King Feisal what those views were, but he considered that if he knew those views he would be able to advise and influence him in accordance with our policy. THE CHaIRIUR expressed the view, which was accepted, that in a matter of this importance the Sub committee’s recommendations must be referred to the Ministerial Sub-Committee. He proposed that a memorandum should be prepared for submission to the Ministerial Sub committee . CONCLUSION . The Sub-Committee agreed (a) to recommend (i) that the outcome most likely to be to our advantage would be the constitution of Syria as a republic with a Syrian as President.(ii\ that for a single individual to hold the crowns both of Syria and Iraq would be most undesirable and would in any case be likely to prove unworkable. (iii) that any attempt by King Feisai to transfer his crown from Iraq to Syria would be contrary to British interests. (iv) that should the crown of Syria be offered to ex-King Ali no grounds exist for opposing his candidature. (b) that a memorandum containing the recommendations of the Sub-Committee and the reasons for thorn should be prepared for the consideration of the Ministerial Sub committee.

My Lord, In your telegram No .10 of September 6 th you repeated to me a telegram sent to Bagdad in reply to the telegram No«335 which His Majesty’s Acting High Commissioner on September 7th addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies regarding the possibility that the Iraqi Prime Minister would shortly pay a visit to the Lebanon, ostensibly on grounds of health, but with the real intention of working for the candidature of ex-King Ali for the throne of Syria. 2. The visit of Nuri Pasha has not materialized, but his place has been taken by Rustem Haidar, Iraqi Minister of Finance, who has been conducting an active and open campaign /not however on behalf of ex-King Ali but in the interests of King Faisal. Although he has given out that the views which he has expressed are his personal ones, it is locally believed, in view of his long and close connection with iving Faisal, that he is in reality voicing the opinions 01 his royal master. Rustem Haidar is of course not an Iraqi, but a member of an influential family, now of Lebanese nationality, whose stronghold is in the Bekaa round Baalbek. One of his cousins Subhi Bey is at present Lebanese Finance Minister and another Ibrahim Bey is a deputy and has been a L_imster» Rustem Bey is therefore well-known here. He has of course been foregathering with the local Moslem Rationalists, chiefly among whom is Riad Bey el Solh. 3. The activities of Rustem Bey have given rise to much comment. His thesis is that King Faisal was given in Paris certain promises which bring a good deal nearer the realization of his ambition to become the ruler of an united Arabia. I gather from Bagdad telegram Noo337 to the secretary oi State for the Colonies that certain overtures are supposed to have been made to King Faisal in Paris. M« Chauvel to-day told me that nothing is known at the High Commission regarding such overtures. It is therefore possible that the wish may have been father to the thought or that something which was said has been either misunder stood or misinterpreted. 4. However that may be, M. Chauvel who, as I reported in the despatch to Bagdad of which a copy was sent to you in my confidential despatch IIo.lCO of September 17th, at t*.iat time seemed to view without apprehension a renewal Syria on behalf of ex-King Ali . seemed to-day to be distinctly worried Dy the energy displayed by nustem Bey Haidar in the interests of King Faisal. He did-3- not however make to me any suggestion that a remonstrance might be made in the matter 4 5. The question has naturally aroused much interest both in the press and elsewhere; and the nationalists are said to be feeling encouraged. I enclose as showing the Lebanese Christian point of view a somewhat pointed article from ’L’Orient 1 . M. Chauvel in referring to it wondered whether he would receive from the newly-appointed Iraqi Consul-General remonstrances in regard to its tone. If Hashed Bey el-Khoja does make representations, I fancy it might be suggested to him in courteous language that the authorities of his country have by their activities exposed themselves to legitimate criticism.

KIND. 2, Whitehall Gardens y S 0 W Q 1 0 19th October, 1931,The Residency, 2.\~7 Baghdad, -dated 9th October, 1931. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 255 dated the 7th October, 1931, and to inform you that King Faisal raised the question of Syria at my audience with him on the 6th of October. He appeared to regard it as already settled that he would be King of Syria as well as ’Iraq, and to be satisfied in his own mind both that the French Government has seriously made the proposal and that His Majesty’s Government would raise nc objection to it. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, who also raised the question with me on the preceding day, seemed very doubtful whether the project was practicable, I esked the King whether he had gained the impression that it was the intention of the French Government that he should be at the same time King of an independent ’Iraq and of a mandated State in Syria, and ne replied that he had been given to understand that the Syrian mandate would come to an end on his assumption of tne Syrian throne. This appears to conflict with the &lt; f 1 icial dementi published only a fey/ weeks ago by the French Government of the rumours that France was about to abandon her mandate in Syria, and also with statements, which are attributed in the Syrian press to officials of the French High Commission in Syria, to the effect that there is no question of a monarchy being substituted for The Right Hon’ble J.H. Thomas, k,F, Secretary cf State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.l. 1a republic in the Syrian Constitution* Considerable interest has been aroused locally by the reports which have appeared in the Syrian press but, apart from King Faisal himself, I doubt whether anyone really believes it possible that the thrones of Baghdad and Damascus should at this stage be combined under one King, the general tone of the comments being that any such development of French policy Is too good to be true* It appears to me possible that what has really happened is that the French Government have informed certain Syrian nationalist leaders that they will be allowed to choose whatever form of government they desire for Syria, and that this assurance has led to the revival of what King Faisal informed me was by no means a new idea, but had been mooted by the Syrian nationalists themselves two years ago. If this is so, and if the desire is in fact expressed, there is some danger that the dnus of its rejection may be thrown upon His Majesty’s Government, which would have an unfortunate political effect in this country.

THE RE8IDEITCY, 1052/10/31. RAMLEK, 26th September, 1931. My dear Rendel, King Paisal came to dinner on the 23rd and v/as very affable. The Iraq Consul in Alexandria, a brother of King Faisal’s A.D.C., and His Hajesty’s host during his stay in Egypt, told Grafftey Smith in the course of a post-prandial conversation that the French Government hc.d given King Faisal, while recently in Paris, pointed encouragement to consider himself a candidate for the Throne of Syria. 2. According to Dr. Ahmed gadry, Monsieur Berthelot informed King Faisal that the rumour according to which France proposed to offer ex-King Ali of the Hejaz the Kingdom of Syria had provoked official protests from Italy, Ibn Saud and King Fuad (see paragraph 11 of my secret despatch No. 821 of September 5th). Ex-King Ali v/as therefore ruled out; but Monsieur Eerthelot gave King Faisal clearly to understand that, if a sufficiently large proportion of the inhabitants of Syria supported King Faisal’ own candidature, the French Government would put no obstacles in His Majesty’s way. Further, incredible though it sounds, the Iraq Consul stated that King Faisal had been toasted at the Elys&amp;e as King of Iraq and Syria. 3. King Faisal was represented as suspicious of this encouragement, fearing that the French Government might wish to involve him in propaganda and intrigue in jyria, eithero zzri 1 with the simple object of humiliating him by later protests and a rap over the knuckles or in order to fester the demand for a monarchy 5 which they would in due course meet with some other candidate of their own- At the same time the attraction to a leader of the Arab revolt of an advance so dramatic towards the achievement of ‘'Arab Unity 1 ' must be very strong* 4* I understand that king faisal spoke to Sir Urancis Humphrys in Paris with regard to these overtures® His Majesty's version of what happened in Paris 5 may s of course* be based on a misunderstanding* but it is circumstantial enough to suggest that whatever misunderstanding resulted was* in fact* intended- bo I do not remember that there was anything in my conversation with His Majesty that calls for detailed record: he spoke with approval tempered with mild criticism of Mustapha Kemal and modern Tiirkey generally* with unbounded admiration of the position which 3ir Georgo Clerk had created for his country in Turkey* with slight regard for the Persians; and he said that he hoped I would dine with him on my way through Baghdad- I am sending a copy of this letter confidentially to Baghdad- Yours ever* (Signed) P.K.

F8091/31 of the 17th enclosing Sir Francis Humphryj note of his interview ^ith .caisal in Paris, X do not knc'r whether you had received my Secret despatch of the 11th before you - T rote, tut the record of the interview rather amusingly bears out my telegram No. 338 of the 12th on the same subject. In that telegram I also said that it was out side ny province to discuss the Question of the extent to which the French Government should be consulted or informed about any advice we night give to King Ali, It is equally outside my province to discuss officially what lines should be taken with them about their alleged overtures to King Faisal, f. at as you will no doubt be discussing the whole question with Sir Francis, it nay be of interest if I give my personal views. iinci it difficult to believe that the French Government have ever contemplated combining the thrones of Raghdad and Damascus in the person of one individual. It is not quite clear from the record of the conversation whether iaisal definitely stated that they had this in mind but, if he di he must I think have been misrepresenting what Berthelot said, unless of course Berthelot was merely throwing out a fly to see if Faisal would jump at it. The real question is whether we are going to work with France, or against France, in the kiddle East. If we are going to work with her and to accept the fact that / - 1 - ^ circulated as paper II.R. 0.26.Ishe will have a peraaneixt predominant interest in Syria and the Lebanon, I feel ver.y strongly that we ougnt to go to them now and tell them frankly that v.e have heard rumours that they are approaching Ali and Faisal privately; that it is impossible that we shahid not be consulted as to the lines one or the other of them shall take, if they are officially approached; and that we are anxious to avoid any possible suspicion that we are v. orK- ing behind their backs. If it turns out that the alleged approaches to one or the other, or both, are inventions, we shall know where we are. If, however, the French Government take the same line as Ponsot did when Sir Francis met him in Eeyrout the other day, i.e,, that the French Government would be quite prepared to accept any candidate for the throne who was really wanted by the people of Syria, we could tell them that our advice to any prospective candidate would be as outlined in pax agraph 4 of my despatch. Ve shea Id, I think, at the same time make it clear that, so long as ’Iraq remains under British and Syria under French influence, we sho Id not regard it as in the interests of either country that the two thrones should be combined under one King. As regards the question which of the two Kings should be encouraged to present himself as a candidate for the Syrian throne, my own personal feeling is that, unless Faisal really preferred to give up ’ Iraq and take Syria in exchange, we should definitely support Ali. If, on the other hand. It is our definite policy to work against the French in the Middle Last, it would clearly be better to adopt the attitude with the French Government that we disassociate ourselves entirely from the Syrian question and are refusing to offer anyadvice to any prospective candidate Tor the Syrian throne. Whether, in this event, any personal advice should or should not, be given by British representatives, is a matter upon which I cannot express even an unofficial view. Faisal is due here on the 29th, wnich is the day on which this letter ought to reach you, and, in view of my very close personal relations with him, I have little doubt that he will try and sound me on this subject very soon after his arrival. I therefore beg you to get some definite instructions sent to me as soon as you possibly can. King xli T s continued ill-health has fortunately saved me for the last fortnight, but I have no reason to anticipate that King Faisal will be in anything but the best of health and spirits, and it is too much to hope for any long continuance of this immunity.

My dear Flood, I am afraid I have been rather bombarding you with telegrams about Syria, but I cannot overstate the importance of the High Commissioner being kept fully informed of every develop ment of French policy in the sister State. Boor King Ali is in a very difficult position and turns naturally to me for advice, which it is impossible for me to give him, if I do not know the facts. I had a long talk with him yesterday, v/hen he unbosomed himself most frankly and begged me to advise him, if only in a personal capacity, if the various approaches which the French have been making to him develop into anything concrete. I am reportirg officially what he said to me about the attitude of the French, and asking for official approval to what I imagine to be the correct line for me to take, if he does subsequently consult me. If this happens before my despatch reaches you, I will try and ride him off, but it may not be easy. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) HUBERT YOUNG. 10.9.31. P.S. King Ali had an attack yesterday - syncope I think - and it seems unlikely that the subject will come up in the immediate future.

He told me that when he passed through Damascus last year. Monsieur Maurepas, who accompanied him on his drive from Beyrout to Damascus, told him that the High Commissioner for Syria would be much interested to know his views about the constitutional question. He replied that, as a passing guest through Syrian territory, he thought it would be improper for him to express any views and if there was to be an exchange of views, the first step should be taken by the French High Commission. 2. As a result of this conversation. Captain Terrier apparently paid a visit to Baghdad from the 18th to the 23rd of February, and had a long conversation with King Ali. He said that the French Government had come to the conclusion that the time had arrived for them to conclude a treaty with %ria on the lines of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922. On King Alitreaty would 'be concluded, he enquiring with v;hcm this replied, with the representative of United Syria, excluding the Lebanon., King All then ashed whether, by the expression ’'the Lebanon'', the French Government referred to the Lebanon as it existed before the ar 5 or to the present Lebanese State, which includes Boyrout and Tripoli and, in addition, certain districts in the B e k a a 5 v/h i c h formerly belonged to D an a s c u s c C ap t a i n Terrier replied that the French Government were willing to leave the question whether the districts in the Bekaa should belong to Syria, or the Lebanon to a plebiscite of the population, which would be held after the treaty had been conelv.ded e King Ali could not remember whether Boyrout and Tripoli were actually mentioned, but his impression was that they rr ere to be retained in the Lebanon and excluded from Syria* 3,. King Ali then asked me whether I agreed that the policy outlined by Captain Terrier was one that he could reasonably accept 0# I replied that, without more specific information, it was quite impossible to express any opinion, oven if I wore authorised to do so t For example, did he understand that the conclusion cf the proposed treaty would bring with it the admission of Syria to membership of the League cf rations? That exactly was intended by a treaty on the lines of the hnglo-Iraq Treaty cf 1922? Hew was the proposed United Syria to be sex up constitutionally? V/ere the existing organic laws of the various States under the Syrian Mandate to be altered by the Mandatory Power before the negotiations commenced, or were the /nogotie bori3 JS ( 242 ) negotie uors cn the Syrian side to negotiate on the assumption that this would be done at a It.ter stage in order to enable the treaty to be concluded? That was the proposed period for which the treaty woulu remain in force 3 iiing Air was unable to ans-ver any of these questions, some of which he thought would probably have to be discussed with himself as a preliminary to any further proceedings. h e had had three Or four interviews with the French Charge d 1 Affaires, both before and after Captain xerrier 1 ^ visit, in the course of which he had endeavoured to obtain some information upon these points, out without success.. His own impression was that there was no intention of admission of Syria to the League of Nations at this stage, and that the French intended to set on foot now a treaty regime under the mandate corresponding to the regime which has been in force here for the past ten years. He had no idea how the constitutional point was to be settled but, his own view was, that there should at least be a Constituent Assembly before any negotiations could begin, xn to the period of the proposed Treaty, he expressed himself strongly in favour of a definite limited period and mentioned six years as the limit. He felt that he would not be satisfied with an article which merely promised, as did Article VI of the Anglo- Iraq Treaty of 1922, that the mandatory Power would use its good offices to secure the admission of the Hand at 0 ry State to membership of the League of Nations as soon es possible, he concluded by protesting that he had no intention of going toi 4 (zzsl * Syria as a French Official. Three other possible candidates had been approached by the French Government - one being a Foroccan ? whose name he gave me as Ibn Zaiwayd; one 9 the ex-Khedive of Egypt, and . A the third, some connection of King ^aud, whose name he could not recall. The people of Syria, would not accept either of these candidates. According to his information, the great majority of Syrians were in favour of a monarchy. He thought it highly probable that he woold again be approached in the future. He begged me most earnestly to give him either official or unofficial advice, if matters proceeded any further. 4° I should be grateful for instructions as to the line which I should take, if this question is raised again, either by King Ali or by King Faisal, before the return of Sir Francis Humphrys. My own views are as follows It is clearly in the interests of Syria that, in order to obtain her freedom from mandatory control she should accept the advice and assistance of the French Government, in such a manner and for such a period as to render it the more lively that they will ultimately follow the example set by Kis Majesty’s Government in Iraq. For this reason, it would be unwise for any prospective candidate to the throne oi Syria to reject a treaty arrangement upon the lines of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, The criterion by which any such candidate should be guided in stipulating for the inclusion, or exclusionof certain districts in the proposed United Syria, should h® the wishes of the inhabitants and the economic future of the country. At the same time, it would be unwise to jeopardise the whole policy by insisting at the outset on the inclusion of districts, which the French Government clearly intend to remain in the Lebanon. With regard to the actual terms of the proposed treaty, everything depends upon the good will of the two parties 9 The Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 could have been interpreted by His Majesty’s Government less liberally than has, in fact been the case. The subsequest provision in the Treaty of 1926 that the question of the admission of Iraq should come up for consideration at successive periods, is a prevision which the Syrian Government might, in any case, reasonably ask to be included in their first treaty, in view of the example set in Iraq, but, apart from this, there seems no reason to suggest that the bases of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 should he materially modified. If there is to be good will on both sides, the result will be the same as it has been in Iraq 9 If there is not, this result will not be achieved whatever modification might be made in the letter of the treaty. 5. I think it would be difficult for me to decline altogether to express any opinion on specific questions, but I fully realise that it may be the policy of His Majesty’s Government to refrain entirely from any intervention in the matter, in order that they may be able to inform the French 56 Government thcit King i,li has not 'been influenced 'by ^ them in any way. On the other hand, it appears to me doubtful whether the French would believe any such assurance, and if His Majesty , s Government are, in any case, to be credited with having influenced him, it may be advisable that they should not lose the opportunity of doing so.

His Majesty first expressed his gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for the very successful manner in which the affairs of Iraq had been handled at Geneva, and then proceeded to give me an account of a conversation which M.Berthelot had held with him a few days earlier. M.Berthelot, be said, informed him that the French Government were considering the terms of a Treaty \diich they hoped to negotiate with Syria next winter, after elections bad been held at Damascus ana a oyrian Government had been formed. Although the present constitution provided for a Republic, it was probable that the Syrians would prefer to have a King rather than a President. This question, and the actual cncice of a King in the event of a Monarchy being preferred to a Republic, were matters which the French Government would be prepared to leave entirely to the discretion of the Syrian people. But M.Berthelot added that the trench Government now realised that they had made a mistake when they expelled King Faisal from Damascus some ten years ago, and they would welcome the return ol Faisal as King of 12 Syria if this was the expressed verdict of the people. King Paisal went on to say that he had received unexpect ed courtesy and hospitality in Paris and that Prench officials from the President down-jards had gone out of their way to show him honour. His enquiries in Damascus indicpt- ✓ ed a tendency on the part of leading Syrians to favour 1/he adoption of himself rather than of King Ali, as a future candidate for the throne of Syria. He was very anxious to know the views of His Majesty’s Government on this subject, and he hoped that when I returned to Baghdad I should he in a position to acquaint him with these views, and to :advise him what course to adopt in case he v/as approached by Syrians as to his willingness to accept the throne of Syria should it be offered to him - I replied that I felt sure that it would not have escaped His Majesty’s notice that the possibility of the Syrian Throne being offered to a member of the Hashimite family lad been mooted on two recent occasions v/hen the French had been concerned to obtain the goodwill of Iraq 9 First about s even months ago when t he alignment of the I.P.C. pipeline was under consideration, and now when we were entering an interesting phase of the negotiations regarding the delimitation of the boundary between Syria and Iraq, and Syria and Transjordan. While I didn’t wish to cast any doubts on the sincerity of the desire of the French Government to live on friendly terms with Iraq, I felt that the somewhat remarkable coincidence of these overtures with the discussion of the two important problems which I had mentioned should not be overlooked. As* r regards the practicability of any suggestion that his ^23^ Majesty should accent the throne of Syria, was it intended that the Kingdoms of Iraq, and Syria should he combined under a single Parliament and a single Constitutional King or »hat other form cf administration would he devised. The proposal, however attractive it might appear from the standpoint of Ara'D Unity, seemed to me to bristle with practical difficulties. His Majesty replied that in regard to tne pipeline, the transdesert railway, and the boundary be would assume, as was prudent, that the French would remain in 3yria indefinitely. As regards the question of his acceptance of a possible offer of the Syrian throne he wished to be guided by uy advice. He Lad definitely linked nis country’s fortunes with those of Great Britain and he would never do anything to embarrass the interests of his Ally* In his opinion it would never be possible to have a combined Parliament for Iraq and Syria, but if he were ning of both countries he would reside for half of the year m each and appoint a Regent during his absence. He begged me to report this conversation to London and to advise him as to his course of action on my return to Baghdad “ r -rr -f- o» are as follows Ping Feisal’s vanity has been tickled by the over tures - however shadowy and guileful they may be - which h ve recently been made to him by the French. He feels that he has nearly succeeded in winning Independence for Iraq and would like to do the same for Syria. The icea of be coning King of both countries strongly appeals to him, and L,?. is jealous of the candidature of his brother Ali -(At the same time he would probably prefer to see Ali umg of Syria rather than a non-member of the Kashimite family). liiis would give him not only increased power over his own people, rr -o- \ \but added facilities for his favourite pastime of political intrigue in playing off ^ngland and .'ranee against each other. Re has probably already started a secret campaign in Syria in favour of his candidature, and his hand would be immensely strengthened if he could obtain Great Britain’s acquiescence in advance* I suggest that this question should be carefully examined in all its bearings and that the views of Bis Majesty’s Government on the candidature of (a) King Feisal (b) King Ali for the throne of Syria should be communicated to me for my private information before I return to Baghdad* Presumably I should be instructed to inform King Feisal that it is not the practice of His Majesty’s Government to give their views on hypothetical cases, but if I knew privately where the interests of Great Britain lay I might be able to guide King Feisal’s policy in the right direction.

(1278/1278/1) Damascus, 3556 ^ Sir, I have the honour to report that a public meeting was held on the 6th May in memory of a number of Arab leaders executed by Jemal pasha during the war* This anniversary has been celebrated with more and more emphasis during the last few years, and has now reached the full status of an official holiday* 2. The commemoration of the 'Martyrs' 1 lends itself to the ventilation of public grievances; and on this occasion the presence of members of the Syrian GrOvernment gave an additional savour to the speeches, in which they were vigorously criticized. 3* Aft&amp;r a reference by the first speaker to the Italian atrocities in Libya, and an ode contributed by a Trans-Jordan poet denouncing the GrOvernment 1 s subservience to French advisers, the chief speech was made by Aref el Nakady, the late GrOvernment Attorney, the circumstances of whose dismissal were reported in paragraph 3 of my despatch rro.44, of the ‘23rd August, 1930* He pointed out first of all how the Syrians had not been allowed by the French to make any progress towards autonomy, and how the Syrian GrOvernment and administration were completely under the heel of the Mandatory power, who allowed them no freedom of action in even the smallest matter. The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P.,4. He proceeded to chastise the Nationalist leaders, (nost oi whom were present) lor tneir supineness. Their inactivity was draining the strength ol the country. Tney should unite and provoke a new revolution not by arms, because the French were too strong lor them, but by political action, in which they were at least as intelligent. It was quite useless to wait lor the French to do anything for them, as they evidently nad no intention oi doing so. 5. The only indication ol the methods oi his peaceful revolutions that he gave was an injunction to tour the villages regularly and teach the rural population their rights and duties. 6.

                           L'Orient, and the Damascus newspaper,
