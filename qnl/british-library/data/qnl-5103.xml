Proof, Dec. 17, 1918. MEMORANDUM REGARDING THE POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT TOWARDS PERSIA AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE. Introduction. The policy of His Majesty’s Government at the Peace Conference is understood to aim, as far as pos sible, at excluding Persia as a non-belligerent from all discussion, with a view to keeping our hands free ro settle our post-war policy directly with the Persian Government without any mandate from other Powers at the Conference, and without the necessity, as hereto fore, of framing our policy to meet Russian views. The French Government are understood to share this view. Apprt from the merits of this policy, which are dis cussed below, and apart from the legal or moral merits of Persia’s case for participation at the Conference, it appears necessary to be prepared with alternatives in case events have gone too far to permit of such a pplicy being successfully pursued at the Conference. Whether on Persian or American initiative, the idea of Persia’s representation has, in fact, for some time past been discussed at Teheran; and a mission has now actually been appointed, headed by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs; while the Persian Government have Sir P. Cox's tele- in circular to Foreign Ministers at Teheran a list grams, Nor 981 of their general desiderata, which included the demand 985, 1003 , and f or Persian official representation at the Peace Con- iSi 6 ference, and “undertakings from the signatories of ber and 8th De- m peace ensuring Persia’s status in the future.” The cember 1918, and Persian Minister in London has also mentioned such Foreign Office desiderata in conversation here. His Majesty's P ^o^Nos! 020 Government have, indeed, pointed out to Sir P. Cox 626,and630ofthe that the representation of Persia, as that of other non- 27th November belligerents at the Peace Conference, can only be and 3rd December, settled by the Conference itself, and have instructed him to discourage, as far as possible, any further dis cussions of the Persian Government’s claims, and to confine himself in any case to informing the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government would consider sympathetically any reasonably concrete, pro posals which Persia may eventually put forward at the Conference. At the same time, Sir P. Cox was authorised to tell the Persian Prime Minister, for his personal information, in reply to an enquiry by Vossugh ed Dowleh when it was understood that the Shah might select him as Persian representative, that His Majesty’s Government would be “ particularly glad 1 to see him at the Conference.” It is clear, therefore, that His Majesty’s Govern ment must be prepared for the eventuality ot the ques tion of Persia arising directly or indirectly at the Conference; and once it does so it may be difficult to limit the discussion. Indeed, the inclusion by the Persian Government in their vague desiderata of every question from political independence ami fion- tiers to economic concessions and capitulations, indi cates how discussions, once started, may lie extended. [ 1088 ] B2 With a view to meet such a contingency, this memo randum has been prepared. In it aji attempt has been made both to suggest policy and at the same time to collect the material data for decisions on the more important specific questions in which international issues and British interests are involved. For the sake of convenience, the memorandum has been divided into three main parts—political, general, and eoonomic —and sub-divided on the basis of the specific ques tions summarised as follows:— (A.)— Political. (1.) Independence and integrity. A mandate from the Conference for His Majesty’s Government to pro vide financial, administrative, and military assistance to Persia, or, failing such a mandate, a similar man date for Belgium with the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. (2.) Frontiers. Status quo. (3.) Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. A declara tion of annulment by His Majesty’s Government endorsed by the Conference. (4.) Assistance to be given under (1). The mandate to be as far-reaching as possible. (B.)— General. (1.) Position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Status quo. (2.J Flags on the Caspian Sea. Neutralisation of sea and freedom for use of commercial flags of all nations. (3.) Islands in the Persian Gulf. Definite renuncia tion of Persian Government’s claim to Bahrein, Abu Musa, and Tamb; surrender of Messrs. W T onckhau9’ claim in Abu Musa. (C.)— Economical. (1.) Extra-territoriality of foreign subjects. Con tinuance of capitulatory regime, subject to nature of mandate under (A), (1), and (3). To endeavour to exclude from scope of Conference, leaving questions, where necessary, to direct settle ment between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government— (2.) Persian Customs tariff. (3.) Railways. (4.) Finance. (5.) Telegraphs. (6.) British concessions in Persia. (7.) Reparation for damage done by belligerents in Persian territory. (A.)— Political. (1.) Independence and Integrity. The independence and integrity of Persia have always in theory been cardinal principles of His Majesty’s Government’s policy. Two factors, the aggressive policy of other powers and internal dis order in Persia have, however, modified these princi ples in practice and led to more or less direct inter-ierence by His Majesty’s Government in Persian affairs. While the first of these factors may for the present be held to have disappeared with the temporary dissolution of .Russia, Turkey and Germany, the second factor remains, and has indeed assumed greater im portance through the substitution of the danger of Bolshevist contagion {e.y. in the provinces of Azer baijan and Gilan) for the aggressive aims of the late Russian Government. The present internal situation in Persia may be illustrated from an extract from a recent telegram from Sir P. G'ox: “owing to inveterate corruption, extortion and injustice on the part of the ruling classes from the Shah downwards, the condition of the peasantry is admittedly deplorable. At present Persia is only saved from bankruptcy by our financial help and from active disorder by the presence of our troops. Were these safeguards to be withdrawn, on the signature of peace, North Persia must become a prey to complete chaos if not to violent revolution.” The question of Persian independence and integrity at the Peace Conference seems therefore to resolve itself into the question whether or not anarchy in Persia is to be allowed to continue. Both from the British and Indian and from the international point of view the answer is clearly in the negative. From the Persian point of view the answer appears also to be in the negative, but less clearly so from that of the Persian ruling classes. British policy in Persia must primarily be governed by considerations as to the security of India on her North-West frontier (Afghanistan and Baluchistan) and probably also in the future by considerations arising from the contiguity to Persia of a Mesopotamia under some form of British protection; and “ India’s ” (and it might be added “ Mesopotamia’s”) “primary requirement ” as stated in part II (4) of the India Office memorandum of the 4th December, 1918, (“Indian desiderata at the Peace Conference ”) “is that Persia should enjoy sufficient political stability to make her a tolerable neighbour.” This ideal is far from being realised. From the international point of view no other great Power (unless and until some stable Russian Govern ment is revived) has any such direct interest in Persia’s internal condition as Great Britain, but the general atmosphere of the Peace Conference will presumably be affected by humanitarian ideals: the existence of American Missions at Urmi and elsewhere in Persia and the recent relief work of the American relief Commission illustrate the practical application of American idealism in Persia and the Conference can hardly be expected if the subject of Persia be raised to acquiesce in any solution of the Persian question which left that country a prey to anarchy. The Persian point of view is more difficult to estimate. The politically conscious }K)rtion of Persian public opinion is small and Persian politics are notoriously corrupt. From Sir P. Cox’s recent tele grams it appears, however, that only a few demagogues stiff believe in Persia’s ability to right herself without foreign assistance; and extreme democrats and moderates alike appear to realise that such assistance must be continued, while differing as to whether it is4 to be given by one or many Powers, by America or Great Britain. In any case in the interests of civilisa tion and international comity alone Persia can hardly be allowed to refuse to adopt the only alternative course to internal chaos. If therefore from every point of view r , British, Persian and international, it is clear that foreign assistance to Persia must be continued, British policy towards Persia at the Peace Conference should be framed on that basis. The following five courses then appear open to us: I.—We might endeavour to induce the Conference to shelve the whole question of Persia with the object, as apparently desired by the Government of India (see Viceroy’s telegram of the 26th November, 1918, to the India Office) of fostering the reformation of Persia primarily by ourselves with the minimum of effort and expenditure and with no mandate either from Persia or other Powers. Apart from the practical difficulty of persuading the Conference to adopt such an attitude, when once the Persian question has been raised at the Conference, such a policy seems most undesirable for the reason that w T e should not only tend to bear in Persia the whole onus of Russian un popularity as the heirs of the policy of the Anglo- Russian Convention, but also that we should have done nothing to meet international criticism of a con tinuance of our predominant position in Persia. II.—We might suggest at the Conference that a mandate should be given to a foreign power to assist Persia and that the choice of that power should be decided on the principle of self determination by Persia. Whether or not Persia decided in favour of a mandate to Great Britain would to some extent depend on the method chosen to apply this principle. 1 he probable method would be a vote taken by some sort of constituent assembly and our past experience of the attitude of the Mejliss, the character of the present Shah anil the instability of any Persian Government (even one most favourable to our interests such as the present one) render it most unlikely that the mandate would be given by such an assembly to Great Britain. In any case it is suggested that our vital interests and the considerations advanced in the immediately follow ing paragraph as to the danger to those interests, involved in the establishment of the influence of any other great power in Persia, render the policy too pre carious for His Majesty’s Government themselves to suggest or to support, if suggested by other members of the Conference. in.—-We might endeavour to secure a mandate from the Conference for some other Power or Powers. Our vital interests in the security of India, and Meso potamia would appear, however, to make it most undesirable that any great Power such as United Mates or France should undertake the task, and secure a predominant position so close to the Indian fron- This would be especially true in the case of Fro nee, were she to secure at the Peace Conference sonm direct or indirect control over parts of Syria' over Armenia and possibly the Caucasus There is5 fortunately, however, no indication that France con templates raising this issue at the Conference, and the views of the United States seem also to have been modified, if Sir P. Cox is correct in thinking that the American Relief Commission’s recent visit to Persia had a primarily political object, and that the opinions expressed by the Mission and by its chief, Mr. -ludson, are likely to effect the policy of President Wilson at the Conference. The Mission is understood to have expressed the view that the United States had no intention of embroiling itself financially or politically in Persia, and to have even suggested that the task of reconstruction in Persia, as in Mesopotamia, should properly be undertaken by Great Britain. On the other hand, past experience of the Shuster Mission and the Swedish-officered gendarmerie pre clude us from favouring a mandate being given by the Conference to any of the small neutral nations to undertake single-handed the reconstruction of Persia. In the interests of efficiency the policy is undesirable, and in our own self-protection we cannot afford to run the risk of the small neutral becoming the tool of some Great Power hostile to us. If, however, the Confer ence proves strongly in favour of this policy, we should be prepared to press the case of a neutral nation which, on general political grounds, is likely now and in the future to consider our interests most sympathetically. Our choice would appear to lie between French-Swiss, Norwegians, Danes, or Bel gians. Inter-Scandinavian rivalry renders it im prudent to suggest a mandate to Danes or Norwegians to take the place of Swedes, and the Swiss Government would doubtless refuse to accept a mandate which drew an invidious national distinction between their citizens. On the whole the preference on poll Gcal grounds (and on grounds of efficiency) should perhaps upc given to Belgium, although it is to be remem- ™No 896 of bered that in the past commercial penetration ostensi- the 26th October: bly Belgian has in other countries been frequently louiud to be a cloak for Russian, French, or German financial operations. Belgium is, however, favoured by feir P. Cox, and it may be mentioned that the Belgian Minis ter at Teheran has recently stated that Belgium is anxious to play a leading role in co-operation with us in the regeneration of Persia. If there is opposition at the Conference to Belgium, as likely to favour qur interests too closely, it is suggested that from our point of view Norway would be the least objectionable, and that we should' press for the mandate to be given to jy \v e should endeavour to secure the mandate for ourselves. Prima facie this course appears the least acceptable to the rest of the Conference, having regard to our present responsibilities and our other desiderata at the Conference. On the other hand, there is now some indication of American support lor the policy, and the Persian representative at the Conference, if he voices the views of the present Per sian Prime Minister, maybe an active supporter, and in any case is not likely to be actively averse. As the Powers most inclined to oppose the grant oi &amp; man date to us, Germany, Turkey, and Russia, will be unable effectively to oppose us at the Conference, the [ 1088 ] '0 practical chides of success for such a policy are there- AUtofsame time the policy is the only one that offers sia’s future restoration and prosperity. In any case our past unpopularity is bound to diminish, as we are able to free ourselves of the burden of the Anglo Russian Convention and the odium incurred by Rus sian methods of carrying out that Convention. The only real objection from the British point ot view lies in the extent to which this policy might add to our administrative and financial commitments at a time when our resources in this direction will already be severely strained by our expenditure in the war, by our task in India and Egypt, and by our future com mitments in Mesopotamia, and possibly in Arabia and Syria. If, however, the reconstruction of Persia is pushed forward gradually there is no reason why om expenditure should be heavy, while the politiaal advantages of the policy as a whole, combined with the material advantages offered us of realising at any rate some return for our past expenditure, appear outweigh this objection. V.—Finding that the Peace Conference is resolutely opposed to giving a direct mandate to Great Britain, it is still open to us to endeavour to secure a mandate for some other Power, to be assisted in the task of regenerating Persia by the financial, and possibly military, assistance of’ Great Britain. As argued under II above, this country would be Belgium, or failing Belgium, Norway. From the point of view of our own interests and Persian interests, the plan is less likely to produce administrative efficiency than that of a direct mandate to Great Britain. On the other hand, it would probably secure for us all the control and security which we desire, and by making our influence felt indirectly, we should be diminishing the extent of the unpopularity which any form of British interference in Persia might arouse at present among Persian extremists and among other Powers. The question whether we should press at the Confer ence for a joint mandate to be given in the above form to Belgium and ourselves, or whether we should merely aim at securing the mandate for Belgium and relying on securing some direct arrangement with the Belgian Government at the time or later can hardly be solved, except in the light of the course which events may take at the Conference itself. In the light of the above considerations, the policy of His Majesty’s Government at the Peace Conferenceshould be ±a the first place to press for a direct man date from the Conference for Great Britain to give Persia financial, military, and administrative assist ance, and that if this policy be found impracticable, His Majesty’s Government should aim at securing such a mandate for Belgium, or, failing Belgium, Norway, the agreement of Belgium (or Norway) to be secured (either through the intermediary of the Con ference or by direct and private arrangements with His Majesty’s Government) to the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government in Belgium’s or Norway’s task. (2.) Frontiers. It is suggested that as at present advised, His Majesty’s Government should resist any attempt on the part of either Persia or any other Powers to altea' the present frontiers of Persia. The western frontier has already been carefully fixed with due regard to geographical and ethnological considerations by the Delimitation Commission appointed under the Proto col of Constantinople, November 17, 1913, while no point of dispute is understood to have arisen recently on the northern and eastern frontiers. There is in fact no reason why His Majesty’s Government should aim at any other policy tljan the status qua, unless and until Persia raises this question with greater orecision than hitherto. i (3.) Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907. The Anglo-Russian Convention of the 31st August, 1907, was the outcome of the general policy then being pursued by His Majesty’s Government towards Russia and directed towards eliminating as far as possible all causes of rivalry between the two countries, particu larly in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet. By the Convention both Powers pledged themselves to main tain the independence and integrity of Persia and agreed to divide the country into three spheres of influence; the Russian sphere in the north, where Russian interests predcfminated, bounded by a line drawn from Kasr-i-Shirin passing through Isfahan, Yezd, Kakhk to the point of intersection of the Rus sian, Persian, and Afghanistan frontiers ; the British sphere in the south-east, where British interests pre dominated, bound by a line from the Afghan frontiers through Gazik, Birjand, Kerman to Bunder-Abbas and an intermediate neutral ” zone between tbe two spheres. At the time His Majesty’s Government regarded the Convention as a self-denying ordinance which concerned themselves and Russia and not as a measure interfering with or affecting Persian sove reignty. The Persian Government were not consulted as to the Agreement, however, and have never ceased to regard it as infringing Persian sovereignty. The full weight of its unpopularity, however, fell on His Majesty's Government who, in their desire loyally to abide by the Agreement, were forced to acquiesce in the aggressive methods adopted by Russia in her own SP The present position with regard to the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 is that His Majesty’s8 Government have informed the Persian Government through Sir P. Cox of their willingness to regard the Agreement iteelf as in suspense and to take up the question of its complete abrogation as soon as there should be established in Russia a stable Government which we could recognise and with whom we could deal. Primd facie there would seem to be little object in raising the question of this Convention at the Con ference, as by doing so we might involve ourselves in an academic discussion of the merits of that Conven tion and of the policy which led us to conclude it. It is suggested, however, that this would be taking a short view, and that in the long run we should un doubtedly gain by declaring at the Conference our intention to abrogate this Convention and by securing the Conference’s endorsement of such a declaration. Such a step would be in the interests both of ourselves and Persia. It would give us a greater chance of successfully appeasing Persian public opinion from the outset, were we to secure a direct mandate in Persia from the Conference; it would also enable us to meet any objections raised by a future Government in Russia towards the policy which we should have pursued in Persia during the days of Russia’s dissolu tion bv pointing to the definite act of the Peace Conference itself. (4.) Financial and administrative control and the Cossack Division, Gendarmerie t and South Persia Rifles. The above questions are treated together because the experience of those foreigners who during the past decaae have endeavoured to set Persia’s internal affairs in order clearly shows that the new regime w nich is to establish order must be financed; that in the last resort the necessary money for this purpose must be found from Persian sources, since no external loan can be raised except on the security of the customs receipts, telegraph returns, &amp;c.„ and that to ensure any regular revenue from such sources, it is e^oential to centralise the administration and effec tively to police, under the control of such a centralised administration, the provinces and particularly the commercial roads, with a view' both to prevent robbery a td to check the financial extortion of provincial go ernors. Since 1000 the control of the Persian Customs administration has been in the hands of Belgian advisers (MM. Nans, Priem, and Mornard) ; a 1 reach financial adviser (M. Bizot) was appointed as early as October 190/, and in 1911 Frenchmen were appointed as advisers to the Ministries of Justice and the Interior. The most radical and far-reaching at empt at reform was, however, inaugurated bv an American, Mr. Shuster, who was appointed Treasurer- General early in 1911. He endeavoured not only to centralise the administration by making all receipt'and expenditure of revenue (both from the Customs and er sources) subordinate to his personal control but ! e a 1 lso endeavoured to secure an uniform police force m the shape of a Treasury gendarmerie under foreign othoers to enforce order and to ensure a proper collec ition of revenue all over Persia. The principle of such a Persian force under foreign officers had indeed already been accepted by the Persian Government under pressure from Russia and Great Britain; a Persian Cossack brigade under Russian officers had existed in North Persia for a considerable time; and in the year before Mr. Shuster’s arrival the proposal for a gendarmerie in the south (particularly for the province of Lars) had been accepted by the Persian Government, and Swedes were being selected to train and officer the force. It may here be mentioned that during the present war, owing to the pro-German activities of many Swedish officers, a large part of the Swedish-officered gendarmerie was disbanded and a new force under British officers and N.C.O.’s was created under Sir P. Sykes (who is nominally in the Persian service) with the title of the South Persia Rifles In spite of the active support of a considerable body of Persians, and particularly of the Mejliss, Mr. Shuster failed, because his methods, radical, courage ous, but politically tactless, inevitably brought him into conflict with the Russians, who were on the whole on the side of the more reactionary elements in Persia and hostile to the Mejliss and nationalists, and could not allow Mr. Shuster’s impartial endeavours to secure the best men for his regime to conflict with the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 {e.g., the case of Major Stokes). Unfortunately His Majesty’s Government were precluded by con siderations of world-wide policy from supporting Mr. Shuster, as such local support would have involved a divergence from our attitude of unswerving loyalty to the above-mentioned Convention. The experience of Mr. Shuster shows however (a) that foreign assistance of a radical reforming kind is not necessarily distasteful to Persians (of course Per sian nationalists supported Mr. Shuster’s policv.very largely because they saw that it would tend inevitably to become anti-Russian), (l) that such a policy would l)e really in British interests, if and when the necessity of giving prior consideration to Russian views should cease, and {c) that, in the opinion of an impartial judge (Mr. Shuster), the task of reform, particularly the creation of a Persian force to ensure order, should most properly be submitted to Englishmen. If then, as suggested under (1), we are to aim at securing a mandate from the Conference for Great Britain (or Belgium with British co-operation) we should certainly ask that this mandate should be a far-reaching one, enabling us to carry out reforms on the lines of Mr. Shuster’s programme, i.e., the appointment of “ advisers” chosen from nationals of the mandatory Power (who in practice and at first, during a transitionary period, should be executive officers) to the Ministers of Finance, Justice, and the Interior and the creation of an uniform force for the whole of Persia to be nominally Persian, but with the trained assistance, also during a transitionarv period, of officers chosen from the nationals of the mandatory Power, and incorporating ’the Cossack Division, the gendarmerie, and the South Persia Rifles. [1088] DThe latter task will present some difficulties. The Cossack brigade, established in lb79, is composed of Russian oliicers and Jtf.C.O/s, whose services are lent by tne Russian Grovernment, some i'ersian officers and Persian rank and file. Before the da^s of the gendai- merie it was the only reliable force in 1 ersia, as Ix/ing the onlv force properly paid and drilled. It is true that the brigade is no longer financed by Russian but solely by British money which gives His Majesty’s Government a measure of control. The position, how ever, is complicated by the fact that the Russian officers who control the force regard themselves as guarantors of the interests in Persia of the future Russian Government which, they expect, will pursue the old Russian policy in Persia. If our present forces are withdrawn from Persia, the leader of the Cossack Division will become a dictator and upset any Persian Government not in favour of Russia and reaction. It is therefore essential that in order to merge the Division in the new uniform force we should secure a mandate from the Conference enabling us to substitute British for Russian officers while our troops are still in North-West Persia, since any future Russian Government would have a stronger case against us if our action was taken on our own initiative indepen dently of the Conference. The merging of the Swedish gendarmerie in the uniform force would not appear to present any great difficulty, many of its officers having already been disbanded, but the question of the South Persia Rifles is somewhat different. This force, though nominally Persian, is regarded as British by the Persians and is therefore very unpopular. Secondly, we have already pledged ourselves to hand over to the Governor of Bars that portion of the force which is based on Shiraz as soon as effective measures for securing the opening of the Bushire—Shiraz route has been taken, and provide no change is made in the Governorship of the province without our consent. It would appear, however, that if we succeed in securing from the Conference the general mandate we desire, we could merge the Rifles in the uniform force without disbanding it in defer ence to the inevitable demands from Persians, and we could also regard ourselves as free of the above pledge, if that pledge were found to conflict with the arrange ments necessitated by the creation of an uniform Persian force. (B).— General. (1.) Status of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The Sheikh’s authority extends over the port of Mohammerah (on the Karun river near its confluence with the Shatt-el-Arab), the navigable section of the Karun river up to Ahwaz, and the Arab tribes in the neighbourhood of the river. He is nominally a Persian subject; but, owing to the lax control exercised by the Government at Teheran over the border provinces, he possesses a local autonomy in practice and by prescriptive right, but not by any written agreement or understanding with the PersianGovernment, whose Customs administration covers the Sheikh’s territories. Great Britain has had close commercial relations with( tlie Sheikh for a long period, which assumed particular importance with the concessions accorded to Mr. W. K. d’Arcy in 1901 by the Persian Govern ment for working oilfields on the borders of Moham- morah. This concession (see (C) (6) beknv) was taken up by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909, who made an agreement with the Sheikh in that year, and laid a pipe line from the Maidan-i-Napthun field to a refinery at Abadan, close to Mohammerah, the Sheikh undertaking to police the refinery and lower section of the line. By an agreement with the com pany, signed on the 20th May, 1914, His Majesty’s Government secured a controlling interest in the company. In 1909 Sheikh Kazal began to press His Majesty’s Government for more definite political assurances of a nature both to safeguard his dynasty and his position vis-a-vis the Persian Government and foreign Powers other than Great Britain. Such assurances were given in a general form in a written communication from Sir P. Cox on the 15th October, 1910; and on the 8th December, 1910, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs enquired whether there was any truth in the report that the Sheikh was under British protection. The British Minister at Teheran replied that the Sheikh was not a British-protected person but that His Majesty's Government had special relations with him, and would support him in the event of any encroachment on his rights. It was decided at the time that no further information should be conveyed to the Persian Government regarding the Sheikh’s relations with His Majesty’s Government. The present relations of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis the Sheikh on the one side and the Persian Government on the other are determined by the terms of the following written communication made to the Sheikh on the 22nd November, 1914, the date of the occupation of Basrah by British forces:— “ With reference to the assurances conveyed to your Excellency in my letter dated the 15th October, 1910 (=11th Shawwal, 1328), and having regard to the further valued services and co-operation which your Excellency has rendered to the British Government and British interests in Arabistan and the Shatt-el-Arab, I am now authorised to assure your Excelkmcy personally, and do so by this writing, that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and, whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, His Majesty s Government will be prepared to afford you the sup port necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solu tion, both to yourself and to us, in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safe- onard you to the best of their ability against any unprovoked attack by a foreign Power, or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given foryourseL and for your successors from among your male descendants, and shall hold good so long as you and they do not fail to observe your and tiieir obligations towards the Persian Government, pro vided always that the nomination of your successors from among your male descendants shall be subject to confidential consultation with, and the approval of, His Majesty's Government, and so long as you and they shall continue to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to that Government. “ Vis-a-vis the Persian Government, we shall do our best to maintain your Excellency in your present state of local autonomy. Further, the date gardens which you now possess on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain in full possession of you and your heirs, and immune from taxation.” The status quo seems to be satisfactory to us, and it is suggested that w r e should endeavour to avoid the question being raised at the Conference by the Persian Government. (2.) Flags on the Caspian Sea. article 8 ot the nusso-Persian Treaty of Turkman- cha,i (i»28) affirmed Russia s ancient right to be the only Power with ships of war on the Caspian. Apparently by usage rather than by treaty stipulation, Russia has since acquired similar privileges.as regards her commercial flag on the Caspian, and the Persian Minister's recent reference to this question in a con versation here regarding the Persian desiderata at the Peace Conference, is therefore easily intelligible. on the basis oi the general policy towards Persia and Russian interests in Persia respectively, suggested under headings (A) (1) and (3) of this memorandum, His Majesty’s Government would appear to have nothing to lose by supporting Persia's demand to be allowed to fly her commercial flag on the Caspian. It is probable that during the course of the Conference more than one independent State the Azerbaijan and Daghestan States) apart from Russia proper and Persia, will be set up with a frontier touching the (-aspian. Probably, also, British subjects may in the future acquire concessions from the riparian States, enabling them to run commercial vessels on these waters, and it is therefore suggested that while sup porting Persia’s demand on this question, His Majesty’s Government might even go further and pro's that the Caspian should be thrown open to the commercial flags of all nations. It is not known whether the Persian Government w mh to open the question of the Persian naval flag on tb “ Caspian. If so. and if the question could he con- h T v d to one of the Persian flags alone, w r e should, per- hans, lose little by supporting Persia, in the light of b&lt;^ oast maritime record. It is clear, however that fb- question could not be so confined, and that the c^i^s of the other riparian States would have to be considered. In that event, our policy should aim either a f shelving the whole question or at securing the n-wtralisation 0 f the Caspian Sea. The latter policywould, however, probably raise such strong objections from non-Bolshevist Russia that it would seem advis able to leave the initiative for such a suggestion to other Powers at the Conference. If the suggestion is made and finds support from other members of the Conference, His Majesty's Government might with advantage consent. (3.) Islands in the Persian Gulf. (a.) Bahrein. For over a century His Majesty’s Government have been in direct relations with Bahrein, with whose rulers various treaties have been concluded. It is unnecessary here to go fully into the history of Bahrein but a point worth mentioning in detail is the I reaty of 1880, by which the Sheikh undertook to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any other state or government, and to refuse permission to any other government to establish agencies or coaling depots on his territory without our consent. Generally our relations with Bahrein may best be described as a protectorate in all but name. At any rate it may be said that Bahrein has been under sole British domination since 1820. We have frequently had to intervene in the internal affairs of the island; the British Political agent exercises wide judicial powers there (vide the Bahrein Order-in-Council of the 12th August, 1913), and we have both in theory and practice upheld our claim to protect Bahreinis in Persia and Turkey. Both Persia and Turkey ha ve also repeatedly claimed Bahrein and we have as repeatedly repudiated their claims. The Turkish claim has not been renewed of recent years, and we can presumably insist on full renuncia tion at the Conference. The Persian Government have however renewed their claim more recently than the Turkish Govern ment. Its only basis is‘an agreement made in 1822 by the British Resident at Bushire with the Prince of Shiraz, recognising Bahrein as a dependency of the province of Pars. This Agreement was quite contrary to the views of the Government of Bombay, and letters were written to the Prince of Shiraz disavowing the Treaty, and announcing the recall of the Resident. The Shah also declined to ratify and was equally severe on the Prince of Shiraz. The treaty vyas therefore ratified by neither partv and is worthless. The Persian Government have no other valid ground for their claim. ^ This, however, has not pTevented the Persian Government from puttng it forward on various occasions, although its absurdity is illustrated by the fact that it was only by the exercise of our authority in 1905 that the Sheikh was induced to punish some of his subjects who had murdered Persians. So recently as 1908, 1909 and 1910, and throughout those years, there was considerable friction and corres pondence over this Persian claim. In 1913 the Resident at Bushire urged that this constant source of trouble should be removed once and for all, and that we should secure the abandonment by the Persian [1088] * EGovernment of its empty claim to sovereignty and the recognition of our protective rights”. It had aiso been proposed at the foreign Office in 1908 that the time had come to “ regularise the position at Bahrein.” Various points for definite settlement were enumerated, including the* assertion of our jurisdiction over foreigners, administrative reforms to check the corruption ol the Sheikh’s rule, customs con trol by a British Commissioner, which was rendered additionally important by the Arms Traffic, and financial revision to enable the execution of necessary public works, especially harbour and pier construction. On such measures the development of a promising trade depends. It was also recommended that Bahrein would be a Free Port under British control, and that a Bank should be opened there. These desiderata remain as important as when they were formulated by this Department and Sir P. Cox. Bahrein has importance as the centre of the pearl industry, which for over a century has been assured by British ships. It was once renowned for a fertility which it might remain under good government. It possesses an excellent water supply, and the climate is far more suited to Europeans than that of Kishm or Muscat. Its geographical position gives it special advantages as a trade centre in the Gulf. Apart from these considerations, however, the pre sent is a good opportunity for clearing away a trouble some question, that tends to complicate our relations with Persia The Persian Government know that their position is really untenable. We should be asking for no more than a recognition of facts already existing. The various desiderata of Persia, if advanced at the Conference, may well give an opening for insisting on a formal renunciation of her Claim, and a definite re cognition of our special interests and prescriptive position. Even if the question is not raised by the Persian representatives, it might be well for His Majesty’s Government to obtain such international recognition at the Conference. It seems, however, inadvisable to aim at securing the Conference’s sanction for a British protectorate. This claim would arouse friction and suspicion and would add nothing to the substance of our present power. (b.) Abu Musa and Tamb. The ownership of these islands is not at present in dispute. They belong to the Sheikh of Shargah, one of the 44 Trucial ” chiefs of the Arabian coast of the Persian gulf. In the past however, apprehension has more than once been expressed lest the Persian Govern ment should endeavour to establish a claim, and so create trouble in the adjacent pearl fisheries. This actually occurred in 1904 when the Belgian officials in charge of the Persian Customs placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags and hoisted the Persian flag. Representa tions were made by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Government with the result that the Persian flags and guards were removed. The Persian Govern ment, however, reserved their right to discuss with His Majesty’s Government the respective claims to the islands. No further Persian claim to Tamb and AbuMusa appears to have been made of late; but it might we to take advantage ot the present situation to seeui e a dennite renunciation of the Persian claim, as kas been recommended in the case of Bahrein. Ihere is only one further point on which action seems called tor in regard to Abu Musa, and that action nil rfSj ' ve ^ ^ a ^ ei1 at the Peace Conference. lie island contains valuable deposits of red oxide. In 1898 the ex-Sheikh, uncle of the ruling chief, leased the mines to three native concessionnaires, one of whom granted to the German firm of Wonckhaus for four years, with a preterential option of renewal, a monopoly of purchase of oxide from the mines. The ruling Sheikh subsequently cancelled the cone cession. The German Government then took up Messrs. Wonckhaus’ case, and addressed themselves to His Majesty’s Government. They regarded the can- oellation as illegal, and looked to us to compensate the firm. Considerable negotiation led, in 1913, to an agreement to settle the matter on the basis of a cash payment in extinction of all Messrs. Wonckhaus' rights . at Abu Musa. We were about to offer the firm £2,000 in full settlement when war broke out. / This question might be treated on the same lines as our proposals for the Baghdad Railway, the Germans surrendering all claim in connection with the concession. (c.) Bassidu. We occupied Bassidu in 1820. It is at the west end of Kishm Island. It was from 1823 till 1879 the head quarters of the Indian Marine, but has now lost this importance. We no longer use the place as a coaling depot, though’ we keep there an agent who flies the British flag. The rest of the island is under the authority of Persia, who took it in 1852. The Persian Govern ment never appear to have taken exception to our occupation of Bassidu. On the other hand, it has been suggested on various occasions that we should consolidate our position at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, including Kishm. This language is somewhat vague. As, however, there is apparently nothing to prevent us from developing our present position at Bassidu, if we should ever desire to do so, there seems no reason for raising the question at the Conference, while we can well rely on our prescriptive rights, if, as appears unlikely, the point is raised by the Persian Govern ment. (d.) Sirri. This island has some small importance owing to the existence of red oxide. The Persian Government occupied it in 1888. We have never admitted the Persian claim; on the other hand, we have allowed the occupation to continue for 30 years. The real owners, as in the case of Abu Musa and Tamb, appear to be the Towasmi Arab Sheikhs of the Arabian coast, of whom the chief is the Sheikh of Shargah. It might be well to deal with this island at the same time as Bahrein, Abu Musa, and Tamb, if openingis given by the Persian Government; but renunciation of the Persian claim could hardly be secured except as a quid pro quo for some other concession to Persia. In any case, the question is unimportant compared, with that of Bahrein, Tamb, and Abu Musa. (C.) Economic. (1.) Extra-territoriality of Foreign Subjects. The extra-territoriality of foreign subjects in Persia is based on articles 7 and 8 of the separate commercial treaty annexed to article 10 of the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkmanchai of 1828; the other Powers obtained similar privileges for their subjects by most favoured-nation clauses in a subsequent treaty with Persia (Great Britain by article 12 of the Treaty of Paris of 1857). The abolition of the regime of the Capitulations is included in the desiderata recently put forward by the Persian Government (see introduction to this memo randum). His Majesty’s Government informed 1 Sir P. Cox at the time that the proposal could not be entertained until Persia is able to offer reliable guarantees for order and justice, and that this is hardly possible until the necessary judicial and administra tive machinery had been established under the guidance and assistance of a friendly European Power. This communication sufficiently indicates the policy which His Majesty’s Government should pursue at the Conference; in fact, it may assist us to secure Persia; s consent, not only to the grant of a direct man date to us, but also a mandate of a far-reaching nature if we can argue that Persia’s acceptance of a radical scheme of judicial assistance offers her the only reason able prospect of an early mitigation of thc^ extra-terri torial privileges of foreigners. (2.) Persian Customs Tariff. In the past the Persian Customs Tariff has been framed primarily to suit Russian rather than British commercial interests. In February 1903, under a new Russo-Persian Commercial Convention a revised tariff, drawn up by Russia, came into force. This tariff substituted a system of specific duties for the 5 per cent, ad valorem duty imposed on exports and imports under the Russo-Persian Treaty of Turkman- chai, 1828. An Anglo-Persian Commercial Treaty was signed on the 9th February, 1903, and is still operative, by which Great Britain secured equal treatment with Russia under the new tariff, but the duties fell more heavily on articles in which English, and especially Indian, trade was interested, such as tea and cotton piece-goods than on those with which Russia was chiefly concerned. The new tariff is not, however, understood to have produced a seriously pre judicial effect on British trade. One of the Persian Government’s desiderata at the Conference, according to Sir P. Cox, is likely to be “ the drafting of new commercial treaties and Customs tariffs more in conformity with the principles of com mercial liberty.” His Majesty’s Government have17 informed 8ir P. Cox in reply that this question is hardly one which can be discussed at the Peace Con ference. It is doubtful, however, whether a policy of endeavouring to exclude the question entirely from the scope of discussions at the Conference will be success ful, while on the other hand both Persian and British (especially Indian) commercial interests would pro bably gain by a return to the tariffs existing before the above-mentioned Russo-Persian Commercial Conven tion. It may be vs ell to remember this consideration, should we find it necessary to offer Persia specific economic advantages in order to secure her consent co our general line of policy at the Conference. In any case the policy which it is proposed to adopt towards Russian interests in Persia renders it unnecessary for us to pay special attention as in the past to Russian commercial interests. (3.) Railways. The complete absence of railways in Persia before the war (except for 6 miles of light railway at Teheran) was due primarily to the Russo-Persian Agreement of the 11th November, 1890, whereby the Persian Govern ment engaged that no railway should be constructed m Persia for ten years, on the termination of which period the renewal of the arrangement was to be imme diately discussed between the two parties. By a later agreement of the 14th December, 1899, the Persian Government, in consideration for the second Russian loan, renewed the previous engagement with the significant proviso “ that for another ten years, except ing the Russian Government, no other Government shall be given a concession to build railways in Persia.” The latter agreement, in practice, so far as the Persian Government were concerned, overrode certain assur ances as to the construction by an English company of a railway from Teheran to Shuster, and as to British preferential rights of railway construction in Southern Persia conveyed by the Shah in 1888 in an autograph rescript to his Minister for Foreign Affairs (see Foreign Office Confidential paper No. 8673 of 1906, p. 118, and Appendix B to Foreign Office memorandum of February 1908, respecting British interests in the Persian Gulf). In the second place, and at any rate after 1910, Anglo-Russian rivalry and the terms of the Anglo- Russian Convention of 1907 prevented any negotiations for railway concessions in the British, Russian, and neutral zones being definitely settled with the Persian Government. Various schemes were, however, dis cussed between the British, Russian, and Persian Governments in the years 1912-1914, the most impor tant of which were— (a) a railway from Julfa to Tabriz and Urmia in the Russian zone; {b) a railway from Mohammerah to Khoremabad in which a British syndicate (Messrs. Green way, Seligmann, and Lynch) were interested, in the neutral zone; and (c) a scheme for a trans-Persian rail wav starting from Alat on the trans-Caucasus railway via Teheran to the Indian frontier in which an international syndicate (the Soci&amp;e d’Etudes, composed of French, British, and Russian financiers) were interested. [1088] F (!*')The above-mentioned British syndicate also made proposaJs to the Persian Government for railways from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, from Bunder-Abbas to Shiraz, and from Bunder-Abbas to Moharnmerah. During the war the Russian Government completed, for military purposes, the railway from Jidfa to Tabriz. It is difficult to see how the question of Persian railway concessions can be raised at the Peace Con ference, and it would appear ho be in the interests of His Majesty’s Government to resist any attempt at the discussion of the question, thus keeping a free hand to endeavour by direct discussion with the Persian Government to secure concessions for the construction of those lines which will serve both Persian and British interests, and in this connection to press the claims of the above-mentioned British syndicate. With the removal of the Russian influences, both political and commercial, and with the probability that some form of British control over Mesopotamia and the Mesopotamian railways will result from the Con ference, it may well be in our interests to drop the project of the Mohammerah—Khoremabad line and endeavour to secure a* concession for the construction of a railway from Khanikin to Teheran, thus joining Teheran with Basra via the existing Baghdad— Khanikin line. This may enable the large Gulf transit trade, the preservation of which was the chief element in deciding His Majesty’s Government to construct the Khoremabad railway, to be carried at a cheaper rate via Baghdad into Northern Persia, Whilst strategic reasons still render it desirable for us to oppose the construction of a trans-Persian railway in any form to the Indian frontier, the interests of Anglo-Persian trade via the Gulf ports demand the early construction of those above-mentioned railways other than the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line—already proposed to the Persian Government by the British syndicate. (4.) Finance. Past British Expenditure and present Commitments in Persia. It has not been possible to complete this section for inclusion in this memorandum, and a separate paper is in course of preparation by the Departments concerned. It may be well, however, to add a few general observa tions on this important subject here. Since 1900 the issue of Anglo-Russian loans to the Persian Government, the terms of security and the con ditions to be fulfilled by the Persian Government before issue, have formed the most important subjects of diplo matic negotiation at Teheran. The interest, and sinking fund oi) the various loans • granted by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have been chiefly secured on the customs receipts in the province of Pars and at the ports in the Persian Gulf, on the revenue from Caspian fisheries, the posts and telegraphs and the opium tax and excise duties on spirits (the Russian loans being secured chiefly on the customs receipts other than the above mentioned). In spite of this security the Persian Government have never met their liabilities—to an extent which may be illustrated by the fact that, in a return to the House of Lords of the 29th July, 1913, the total debt of the Persian Govern-ment to His Majesty s Government and the Government of India was given as over &lt;00,0001. In addition, every year, and to an increasing extent during the war, His Majesty s Government have been forced to prefer claims for damage to British interests and property in Persia, which are seldom, if ever, met by the Persian Government It is essential to bear the existence of these claims, as well as the indebtedness of the Persian Government to the British Government, in mind, as even a hint that His Majesty’s Government are likely to press them may afford an effective bargaining counter in dealing both with the Conference and the Persian Government, should the latter raise specific financial claims at the Confer ence, such as reparation for material damage or acts of violence committed on Persian soil by any of the belligerents during the war (see 7 below). (5.) Telegraphs. There are two British telegraph administrations in Persia (1) The Indo-European Company, technically before the war at any rate under Bussian protection in Persia, working the telegraph line from Julfa, on the Russian frontier, through Tabriz to Teheran, and (2) the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Govern ment of India. The most important lines worked by the latter are (a) the line from Teheran to Bushire, (h) the submarine cable from Bushire to Jask, (c) the line along the coast from Jask to Kurrachee, and (d) the overland line from Teheran to Quetta, via Yezd and Kerman. The important Anglo-Persian telegraph conventions of the 2nd April, 1868 (line between Gwadur and point between Jask and Bunder-Abbas), the 2nd December, 1872 (Bushire-Khanikin line), and the 12th August, 1901 (Central Persian line), and the agreements between the Persian Government and the Indo-European Tele graph Company of the 10th January, 1891, covering the company's concessions of the 11th January, 1868 (Julfa- Teheran line), of the 24th May, 1869 (Teheran-Bushire and Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas lines), and of the 12th August, 1882, do not expire until 1945, an agreement on this point having been reached by the director of the Indo- European Telegraph Department with the Persian Government in January, 1913. As these agreements and concessions are of consider able financial benefit to the Persian Government, who receive various royalties out of the revenue realised by us from the lines, there appears to be no serious reason to anticipate the specific question of telegraphs being raised at all by the Persian Government at the Confer ence, and the matter has therefore not been treated in further detail here. * Were the question of Persian tele graphs raised, His Majesty’s Government should have no difficulty in securing that the question should be shelved as falling outside of tlie scope of the Conference. This policy seems the correct one for us to adopt in our own interests, since any benefits or further concessions which the Indo-European Telegraph Department or His Majesty’s Government (e.g., for lines between Lingah and Bunder-Abbas, and Kerman, Bunder-Abbas and Jask, discussed in 1913) may desire to obtain, could be more easily secured by direct negotiation with the Persian Government, quite independently of the Conference.(6.) Principal British Concessions. (a.) Anglo-Persian Oil Company. A concession for sixty years was granted to Mr. YV. K. d’Arcy, of London, in 1901, with exclusive right to drill for, produce, pipe and carry away oil and petroleum products throughout Persia, except Gilan. Alazandaran, Khorasan, Azerbaijan, and Astarabad, The concession provided for the allotment to the Persian Government of £0,000L fully paid shares in the Company as well as for a payment of 20,000/. in cash. To carry out the preliminary work of examination and testing a company, known as the First Exploitation Company, was formed in 1903. The effective working of the company was limited to 1 squate mile in the Maidan-i-Naphtun field, situated in territory belonging to the Bakhtiari khans. The First Exploitation Company made a separate agreement with the khans whereby the latter received 3 per cent of the shares in any company formed to work oil in their country, and to facilitate this arrangement a second subsidiary company known as the Bakhtiari Oil Company (1 imited), was formed with a capital of 400,000/. to work the remainder of the. oil-bearing lands in the Bakhtiari country other than the square mile allotted to the First Exploitation Company. In 1909 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited) was formed, and took over all shares in the First Exploitation Company and the Bakhtiari Oil Company which were not held in Persia. In addition to the pioceeds of their shares the Persian Government are entitled to a royalty of 16 per cent, of the net yearly profits of the company. By an agreement with the company of the 20th May, 19! 4, His Majesty s Government secured a controlling intfuest in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company by the investment of some 2,000,000/. W hile the .uea of the company s concession amounts to some 500,000 square miles, oil has chiefly been worked in quantity at Maidan-i-Naphtun, although it has been also proved at Kasr-i-Shirin, and there are surface indications at numerous other places. From Maidan-i- Nephtun the oil is conveyed 150 miles by pipe line to a refinery at Abadan in the territory controlled by the feheikh of Mohammerah, and agreements have been made by the company with the Bakhtiari khans for the policing of the field-works and upper section of the pipe line, and with the Sheikh for the same work in con nection with the refinery and the lower section of the line war the produced by the company from this fiehl has proved one of the chief sources of fuel for the British navy. It is essential, therefore, that any attempt by the Persian Government to raise the question of this con cession at the Conference should be firmly resisted by Ins Majesty s Government. The financial interest of the Persian Government and the Bakhtiari tribes in the prosperity of the Company, and the material benefits in the form of regular employment and medical attention given to the population in the territories worked by tho Company, should, however, afford effective arguments in support of such an attitude on the part of His Maiestv’s Government. It may be added that the principle objec-tions to the Company’s concession in the past have come from the Russian Government, in whose sphere of influence, under the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, part of the concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany lay. The general policy to be pursued by His Majesty’s Government towards Russian interests in Persia at the Conference renders it unnecessary any longer to take these objections into account. (6.) The Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1889 Baron Reuter was accorded the grant for a term of 60 years of the Imperial Bank of Persia, which was established under a British Royal Charter. For 25 years the Bank has been the State Bank of Persia. By the original concession the Bank was empowered to establish its head office at Teheran, and branches in Persia and abroad, and given a monopoly of issuing notes which should be legal tender. It was also allowed to undertake on its own account, or on account of third parties, financial, industrial, or commercial business of various kinds, on condition that none of these under takings were contrary to the treaties, laws, usages, or religion of the country, and that previous notice thereof was given to the Persian Government, The Bank has branches at Tabriz, Resht, Kazvin, M&gt;sin d Ispahan, Yezd, Shiraz, Kerman, IJamadan, Seistan, Kemianshah, Bushire, Mohammerah, Ahwaz, and Sultanabad, and agencies at several other towns. The powerful position enjoyed by the Imperial Bank of Persia and its extreme importance to British trade in Persia makes it essential that His Majesty’s Government should resist any attempt on the part of the Persian Government to raise the question of its concession at the Conference. The only other bank of importance in Persia, the Banque d’Escompte, although an offshoot of the Russian Ministry of Finance, has never been a successful undertaking, and with the present condition of Russian affairs its position as a competitor of the Imperial Bank may be regarded as negligible. (c.) British Road Concessions in Persia. On the 3rd March, 1898, an agreement was signed between Messrs. Lynch and the Bakhtiari khans, by which the former took over the concession for a caravan road from Ahwaz to Ispahan, granted originally to the khans in 1897. The khans were to pay Messrs. Lynch 5,500L in twenty-five yearly instalments. The road was completed apparently in 1900, and the concession taken over by the Persian Transport Company (see below). , On the 27th December, 1889, the Shah granted to the Mushir ed-Dowleh a concession for the construction of a road for wheeled traffic from Teheran to Ahwaz via Kum and Sultanabad, and for another from Burujird to Ispahan. The ownership of the roads was to revert to the Persian Government after sixty years unless the concession was renewed. Work was to begin within six months, and the undertaking was to be completed in two and a-half years. In January 1890 this concession was purchased by the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1898 the Imperial Bank of Persia obtained concession from the 8hah for the construction of a road from Kum to Ispahan on the same terms as the con- [1088] G22 cession which it had purchased, the period for const ruction 'to be ten years. Subsequently the bank transferred all their road concessions to the Persian Transport Company, a company formed under the presidency of the late Mr. H/F. B. Lynch. The Persian Government are understood to have recognised the transaction before its actual completion in a document signed by the Shah on the 24th August, 1902, and stated by the company to provide (1) that the period contemplated for road construction would be prolonged for a further period of ten years from the above date, thus bringing it down to the ’24th August, 1912; and (2) that the company was authorised to construct caravan roads instead of levelled roads in mountainous districts ; but the company reserved to itself the right to convert caravan roads into levelled roads in case it should desire to do so. The Teheran-Kura, Kum-Sultanabad, and the Ahwaz- Ispahan (“ Lynch road ”) roads have since been com pleted, and the company are contemplating certain extensions of their system, a concession for the con struction of which has been given by the Persian Government up to the 4th April, 1921, by an agreement between the Persian Government and the company of the 8th April, 1914. The company wish to secure a further extension of this period. Since the date of Messrs. Lynch’s original agreement of 1898 the company have had constant difficulties with the khans, especially as to repayments fixed by the agreement of 1898, for which the khans in July 1918 were four years in arrears. Although the question of this important British concession has been treated in some detail, it is not a question which the Persian Government would appear likely to raise at the Conference, and the two principal desiderata of the Persian Transport Company, i.e., the repayment of the moneys due to them from the Bakhtiari khans and the extension of their contract beyond 1921, are matters which seem best left to direct negotiation with the Persian Government, quite apart from the Peace Conference. (d.) As regards other British interests in Persia, mention should also be made of the two British telegraph administrations in Persia (see (5) abovej, of Messrs. Lynch’s concession for the navigation of the Upper and Lower Karun, of the Sponge Exploration Syndicate of London, whose members are understood to be chiefly Greeks, and who obtained in August 1905 a concession for 50 years to fish for and exploit feponges in Persian waters from Fao to Gwadur, and lastly of the interests of Andrew Weir, Strick and Co., and Ellinger and Co., who before the war were parties to complicated claim against the Persian Government and a Persian subject, the Muin-ut-Tujjar, regarding the produce of the oxide mines in Hormuz. As the question of these interests is unlikely to be raised by the Persian Government at the Conference, and as His Majesty’s Government appear to have nothing to gain by raising them at the Conference instead of dealing directly as heretofore with the Persian Govern ment, the interests have not been treated in detail here.23 7. Reparation for damage done by belligerents in Persian territory. If Persia raises this question at the Peace Conference we should, in the first place require to receive and examine a detailed statement of the Persian claims, and as suggested above under head B (4), we could probably put a stop to any discussion of such claims by hinting that we were likely to press for a settlement of our own extensive counter-claims. ? { * A &gt;</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000186_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C193</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000186</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C193</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Memorandum Regarding the Policy of His Majesty's Government Towards Persia at the Peace Conference.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1918/1918</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-11-02T21:01:45</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (12 folios)</extent><extent>The file consists of a single memorandum.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 173, and terminates at f 184, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

In its introduction the memorandum states that His Majesty's Government must be prepared for the eventuality of the question of Persia arising, either directly or indirectly, at the conference. The memorandum makes suggestions for British policy on this matter. The suggestions are divided into three sections – political, general, and economic – and are related to specific issues.The first section addresses the following political concerns: the independence and integrity of Persia (the memorandum advises that Britain should seek a mandate to provide financial, administrative, and military assistance to Persia), frontiers (the preservation of the status quo is desired), and the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907 (the memorandum proposes a declaration of annulment by the British Government).The general concerns are as follows: the position of the Sheikh [Shaikh] of Mohammerah [Khorramshahr, Khūzistān, Iran] (which the Foreign Office wishes to remain the same), flags on the Caspian sea (the memorandum proposes the neutralisation of sea and freedom for use of commercial flags), and the islands in the Persian Gulf (the Foreign Office seeks a renunciation of the Persian Government's claim to Bahrein [Bahrain]).The third section of the memorandum discusses economic issues. The memorandum suggests that the British Government should endeavour to exclude from the conference questions relating to the Persian customs tariff, railways, finance, telegraphs, British concessions in Persia, and reparation for damage done by belligerents in Persian territory.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign affairs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Paris Peace Conference (1919-1920)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000186#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
