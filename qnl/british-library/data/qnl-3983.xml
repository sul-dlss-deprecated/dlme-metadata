Out lino of the whole Programme t Finance 1 # In 1945 the Iraq Government set up an Irrigation Development Commission under Mr. F#F. Haigh, Indian Service of Engineers (retired). The Commission has now completed a survey of flood control, water storage, irrigation and land drainage possibilities* 2. The area at present served by irrigation is about 8,000,000 acres. The works proposed aim at extending this area by about 9*000,000 acres. The total cost is estimated at £88,000,000* With a population of some 4*750,000 Iraq is not over- populated. Development of irrigation must therefore necessarily take place gradually* and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture. The Irrigation Commission considered that the full development outlined abov*..' is unlikely to be required before the end of the century. Spread out over this period, the cost would involve an annual average expenditure of about £2,000,000 only. Meanwhile the immediate needs are flood control, limited irrigation development, and drainage in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a programme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £20,000,000 or £2,000,000 per annum. Work on the first stage of the Euphrates (Lake Habbaniya) project is already well advanced. 3. In January, 1949* the Iraqi Prime Minister made a preliminary request to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for a loan of £11,250,000 to meet part of the cost of the first ton years programme. A Technical Missi n of the Bonk visited Iraq in June and proposed that the Bank should finance (1) The Tigris (Wadi Tharthar) scheme. ( 2 ) The completion of the Euphrates (Lake Habbaniya) first stage) scheme, and ( 3 ) The Euphrates (Hilla Canal) scheme. The total amount of sterling and dollar expenditure on these three schemes during the first two years was estimated at £ 830 . n 00 and 2&gt;5* 280,000. The amount of internal expenditure, which the Bank did not propose to finance, was estimated at ID*1*88C,000 4* As regards the Euphrates, the Commissi l n T s Water storage main recommendation is for the development of the Works: existing flood control works at Lake Habbaniya. Euphrates . Such development should ensure floe d control of the river and provide irrigation for about 2,000,000 acres. The estimated cost is £3*375*000. The work is planned to proceed in two stages; the first stage costing £2,000,000 would provide irrigation for 750,000 acres and is already in progress, Provided that money is fortherming, it could be completed in two years c .Water Storage Works; Tigris. 5 . As regards the Tigris, the Commission has recommended that a large reservoir should he constructed in the Y.'adt Thorthur depression, situated between Samarra on the upper Tigris and Hit on the Euphrates. The first stage, which will provide for flood control only, is estimated to cost £7,000,000. The second stage will cost a further £7,£o5,CCCr and, m conjunction with the Gibraltar and Dokhan dans mentioned below, will provide irrigation wafer for 5*412,000 acres. It is considered that the Wadi Tharthar project alone uH it n-n&lt;=m 7 »n flood control of the Tigris and its tributaries except 'n rare occasions. The Commission recommended, however, that to make flood control complete and also to x^rovide additional irrigation water, the Wadi Tharthar project should be supplemented by (a) a dam at the Gibraltar site on the Diyala (£2,574 ? OCC) and (b) a dam at Dokhan on the Lesser Zab (£3,117,000). Irrigati - Development: 'QanalG etc. 6 # The total cost of canals and apportinent works which will be required to extend the area of irrigated land by 9,OOC,COC acres is estimated at £29,335,000. Under this head special mention may be made of one small project, The Commission stated that the Musaiyab and Iskandariyah Canals on the left bank of the middle Euidirates could be extended at a cost of ID.400 to provide irrigation water for 142,500 acres of which about 116,250 acres is under stood to be vacant Government land. This development which could bo begun at any time and Would only take about two years might thus offer possibilities for the settlement of about 2 - 3000 families. Drainage. 7 , In Iraq drainage is essential if the productivity of irrigated lands is to be maintained. Without it irrigated lands are liable to become saline or water-logged. The Commission has therefore recommended that all areas both of existing irrigation and new development should be provided with an adequate drainage system. The cost is estimated as follows (1) Old irrigated areas requiring drainage, 3 &gt; 410,000 acres; £8,160,OCO (2) How irrigated area 9,000,000 £15.360.00 0 ' Total £23,520,000. 8 . Development of hydro-electric power per so Hydro-Elcotrio cannot in-Iraq compete economically with oil. When Power* combined with flood ccntr i ana storage projects, however, the oaos of economic hydro—electric power development are increased. An estimate of £7,667,000 has been included for this purpose. 9 % The Commission has recommended that certain Navigation. small regulating works should bo undertaken on the * 10 lower Tigris to permit navigation at all times of the year. The cost might bo about £2,948,°00. 10.

The Iraqi Government’s Consulting Engineers, Coode, Vaughan-Lee, Prank and Gwyther, consider that there are technical objections to the use of the Wadi Tharthar depression for irrigation storage, since the high water levels involved would impose a heavy strain on the long length of embankment required and constitute a danger to Baghdad. They have therefore recommended that the Wadi Tharthar project should be carried out for flood control only, at an estimated cost of £6,500,000, and that a plan rejected by the Haigh Commission for a dam on the Greater Zab at Bekhme should be undertaken for irrigation storage, at an estimated cost of £9,000,000 Mr. Haigh does not agree with Coode, Vaughan-Lee, Prank and Gwyther * s objections. The Iraqi government have- not yet come to a decision, but the technical experts have come to a compromise understanding. Coode, Vaughan-Lee, Prank and Gwyther have now agreed that they would see no objection to stage one of the Wadi Tharthar project being developed along the lines recommended by Haigh: later on experience will show whether the further development of the project.for irrigation purposes is or is not a practical proposition.(S) &lt;r &lt;*s.

In surveying the information available regarding these Territories, certain common features emerge. The Territories are all poor in natural resources and this, combined with the events of history, have held the indigenous population to a largely subsistence economy, only marginal production finding its way into the market. The means, therefore, to soli—help in social imx^rovement have been lacking, while the inclination, if it ever existed, seems to have been submerged. The result is that the resurgent political and social awareness which has affected these Territories, in common with all other backward territories, since the v/ar, leads to an undue reliance upon the government for any improvement, and there is little sign of any realisation that social improvements can, in the long run, with.anation as with an individual, only be sustained if enough is earned to pay for them. 2. While economic development, therefore, is in no sense an end in itself, it must at least be made to keep pace with social development. The poverty of these countries is such that there is no prospect of capital investment to the extent necessary to found national economies sufficient to support a reasonable social structure being available from internal savings. -Each of these countries, therefore, will need a substantial measure of investment of foreign capital which can only be made either by private adventurers or through the governments of the countries. The economic x^ossibilities t so far as they are known at present, are, however, not of a kind which are calculated to attract the investment ol private capital on any substantial scale. Moreover, a considerable part of the capital investment needed would be for only indirectly remunerative projects, e.g. irrigation and soil conservation. 3. For the foreseeable future the mainstay of all four Territories must be an agrarian economy. If it is to survive beyond a mere subsistence level, it must be conditioned by greater productivity. For this purpose, andepart from major capital works, adequate loan and credit mechanism is required in all four Territories, which would necessarily be associated with the dissemination by the Agricultural Departments of more modern methods and practices. 4 4. It is, at the same time, necessary to stimulate to the maximum extent practicable a lino of secondary industry in each Territory, processing local primary products in order to render their economies, as prodn^ors. of a limited range of x^ri^^y products, less vulnerable. For those purposes also capital facilitio* wnniyi necessary.(2&gt; -2 CYBBMAICA (l) Geneirnl 1. Cyronaioa has an aroa'of 330, 259 square miles but the inhabited area is about 430 square miles only. The population '*5 estimated to bo a little over 300 , 000 , all but a small number &lt;-ming Moslem Arabs. 2 4 As in other ex-Italian Colonies, developments inaugurated hy the Italians had as their objective Italian colonisation and mass Italian settlement, with the result that most of the best land was alienated to Italian settlers. 3* During the second world war the country was fought over five times until the Italians were finally expelled and suffered a very considerable measure of devastation. A great deal has had to be done and much still remains to be done by way of rehabilitation. 4* The country is poor in natural resources. Agricultural and pastoral .pursuits are the basic and traditional occupations of the country and economic improvement must depend mainly on the successful development of greater efficiency in these pursuits and their extension. At present, with the exception of a small amount of static farming on the coastal plain, v/here some irrigation is available, Cyrenaican agriciilbure consists largely of a system of shifting cultivation combined with semi-nomadic pastoralism. The princpal crop is barley, although some wheat is grown on tho Barce Plain and in some of the smaller areas. Rainfall is uncertain and harvests, therefore, tend to fluctuate more or less violontl-y -so -that in some years there may be a surplus of grain (barley) over local needs of ten or tv/enty thousand tons, while in bad years the crop is insufficient for local requirements. 5. Apart from bar-ley, and excepting sponges, (for the reason stated below), livestock and livestock products contribute the principal exports. There are at present no refrigeration facilities and sheep, by far the largest .item, and cattle have to be exported on the hoof, the former mainly to Egypt, though recently exports have tended to deviate towards Greece, and the latter mainly to Malta. Sponge fishing off the coast of Cyrenaica should become a more important factor in the economic life of the country. This has, however, hitherto always been in the hands of Greeks. The Cyrenaicans themselves have never acquired, nor have they ever been inclined to acquire, any skill in this business and, during the Italian regime When the Dodecanese Islands were also under Xtalian Administration, there was no particular incentive as far as ~tto Ito3ians were concerned to encourage Cyren Xcan participation 'in the industry in competition with Greek fishers from the Dodecanese. As a result, Cyrenaica only benefits by the imposition of licence Fees and a duty on the sponges 'exported”. In 1947,. the value of sponges taken in this way by Greek fishers was over £1,000,000, of which approx. £20,000 only accrued to the Territory. This matter ia-v^ry. much in the minds of the Administration, but efforts, to^.ostablish a -local industry have so far been unavailing* 6. Trading activities tend to fluctuate with the success or failure of the crops. See^rvinry industries of any importance are almost non-existent though there have been some developments in this respect recontily, encouraged and assisted by the Administration. / an(II) Present Financial Posi tion 7 # During the British Occupation there has been an average annual deficit on external trade of approximately £4^0,000, and although the total volume of trade has been increased considerably-*, the deficit for the year 1948* excluding the value of sponges on which export duty was paid but which were not, in fact, true 'exports, was still in the region of .0400,000. &gt; 8. Prom the beginning of the British Occupation up to 30th June,'. 1947, during which period the Administration was confined within a policy of care and maintenance, the average annual Budgetary Deficit was approximately £300,000. Since then the deficit has gradually increased as a result of a more expansive policy and it is probable that it may reach an amount of £ 1 , 250,000 for 1950/51. (ill) Possibilities of Economic Development^ 9. During 1946/47 a Working Party was sent to the Territory by His Majesty*s Government to examine the position and to make recommendations with a view to a more progressive policy for rehabilitation and development. Measures recommended included the establishment of •'agricultural and hill farms research stations, a survey of water resources, irrigation schemes, importation 01 seeds and implements, recovery of neglected vineyards, the progressive settlement of Arab farmers with technical guidance and loan assistance, limited re-afforestation, the extension of veterinary services, the organisation ot exports, the creation of a fund £)r loans to local industry and the relief of the destitute and war distressed. Recommendations were also made for the expansion of Education and Medical Services, ihe greater x j art 8f these recommendations has already been x^ut into effect and the cost is reflected in the increasing Budgetary Deficit to which reference is made above. 10, Although the measures already initiated are for the most part preliminary to or in themselves ! long-term measures which may be expected to gather impetus as they are developed, the stage of survey has not yet been passed and more comxjrehensive planning must await the result of further surveys which are now being made. Activities undertaken thereafter will be economic possibilities conditioned by potential local resources and the characteristics of the x^Gopl 0 * ^ likely that any major development in the early stages v/ill be in the agitoul Jural and pastoral fields but an essential early activity v/ill be the education and training of the local inhabitants to play a proper part in the economic life of the country, including the training of skilled craftsmen and executives for commerce and industry. The provision of adequate primary services, is, however, an essential condition of development. Therefor plans have already boon formulated, or are in the process of being formulated, for the rehabilitation and expansion of communications, water supplies (depending to some extent on the result of the Water Survey), sewage in urban districts, and power. 11. If military exuan'llture-in place, it is certain to have the effect of stimulating economic activity, and employment might be found for a limited number of Arab refugees, (IV) Conclusions 12, It is clear that the economy of the country must continue to rest mainly on agriculture and pastoral pursuits, as in other North African Territories, The first requirement is to ensure an adequate supply of water and an extensive survey / / directed- Un directed to the discovery of underground resources which will 1)0 available for irrigation should he undertaken. 13» The productive efficiency of agriculture and animal husbandry should be stimulated by the introduction of higher yielding strains and an improved quality of stock, the diversifies -^ion of production by the introduction of new products suitable ^ the Territory* 1U. The esparto industry in both Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should be brought under control and conducted on a sustained yield basis; a limited measure of reafforestation by herbage yielding fire-wood and with soil holding qualities should be put in hand* The shifting native agriculture should, as quickly as practicable, be replaced by static agriculture and rotational cropping* 16* There are indications of limited deposits of mineral products which are being further investigated. 17. There is also scope for a limited extension of secondary industry in processing local products. The country is poor and capital is unlikely to be forthcoming locally* 18 18.

TRIPOLITANIA (I) GENERAL .• . ..^^ e Population of Tripolitania numbers about 0 O 6 ,000 including some 44,000 Italians, of whom about one half are domiciled in the city of Tripoli t the other half being rfRjngaged for the most part in farming on Italian Colonisation Settlements. The capital, Tripoli, has a population of about 130 , 000 , including 20,000 Italians. The economy of the country rests on its agricultural and pastoral industries and by far the greater part of the inhabitants is engaged in one or other cf these, irom the Italian Concessionaire on an irrigated static farm to the nomadic Arab raising sheep and goats in the rough grazing areas. Yet three quarters of the total area of the country are always unproductive on account of the absence or inadequacy of the rainfall in normal years and of the predominance of desert or semi-desert conditions. Of the 22 million acres suitable for agricultural purposes four-fifths are rough grazing +u^ SS P^- ve million acres are available for cultivation# 01 this over four millions are under shifting cereal cultivation in scattered patches (native farming) and only about 800,000 acres are devoted to static farming in which Italian Colonists play a major part. In fact, development in the economic field, which in the case of Tripolitania has meant development of the agricultural industry, during the Italian regime has had as its primary objective, Italian Colonisation. • . . Nevertheless, the Italian Colonising farmers brought in their tram traders, small scale industrialists, soldiers, civil servants and tourists, whose activities provided employment and brought some degree of prosperity of the country* The spending power created by this influx, stimulated by the large subsidies poured in by the Italian state, found its outlet in large importations of consumer goods from Italy and, though Xtaly Abgcxrbed the greater part of the production of the Colony in so iar as anything was produced beyond local requirements# a very large trade balance resulted in favour of Italy. ?• . _ This period of artificial prosj-'erity continued with lessening degree for some time after the war, and even for a time alter the final occupation of the Territory by British Forces early in 1943, as a result of the considerable spending of occupational forces. The cessation or, at least, very' considerable lessening in this expenditure has, however, since then had a depressing effect on the Territory and two successive harvest failures in 1947 and 1948 made matters still worse. It Is Important, in considering any possible means of developing the economy of the country, to have in mind that by far the greater part of the cultivation is dependent on rainfall and that in one year m every three or four on an average this is inadequate and (XX) PRESENT FINANCIAL PO SITION ^ , B y reason of the fluctuations in the fortunes of the Territory resulting from the fact that the crops one year may be plentiful and another almost non-existent, a comparison of Trade Deficits or of Budgetary Deficits of the Administration, year by year, may be rather misleading. The average annual Budgetary Deficit from the occupation to 30 th Juno, 7949, has been in the region of £400,000. On the other hand, as a result of a complete / crop- 6 - 0 crop failure in 1947 and a considerable failure in 1948* the deficit in 1947/48 was approximately £1 ,100,000 and in 1948/49 approximately £800,000. In the same way, while the average deficit on Trade Account has been approximately £330,000 per year, the deficit for 1947 was £1,218,000 and in 1948 £ 417 , 000 , as a g^esult of the necessity to import grain to feed the population. Exports,have, however, been gradually increased. The value of these in 1944 was £653,000. The corresponding figure for 1948 is £1,533,000 and, as a result of a good harvest this year, from which some 15,000 tons of barley may be available for export, together with the development of the export of esparto grass to the United Kingdom, the value of exports this year, 1949 , is likely to show a further increase. (XXI.) THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 5* Although some minor developments have been achieved in both the economic and the social field, it has not been practicable with a ‘caretaker 1 Administration and in the absence of any decision as to the future of the Territory to initiate or even to plan schemes for major development. Recently, however, a Working Party appointed by His Majesty’s Government for the purpose has visited Tripolitania with a view to making recommendations for immediate improvements and for longer term plans for economic and social development. It is clear that any major development in the early stages would be in the aricultural and pastoral fields. An essential condition of any development is provision of adequate primary services, i.e. communications, water, sewage in urban areas and pov/er as a basis on v/hich to build. Initial development would be in these directions. Other activities would certainly be concerned with irrigation, the restoration and improvement of wells and cisterns and agricultural and animal husbandry research. The possibility of developing any mineral resources would be investigated. Development in the agricultural and pastoral fields would, in turn, give rise to Increased commercial activity and the development of industrial activities already existing. Other industries to which early attention would be turned would be sponge fishing and refrigeration. The erection of a refrigeration station may well be desirable to facilitate the exportation of perishable foodstuffs - including meat. CONCLUSION It seems clear that agriculture and pastoralism must continue to be the mainstay of the economy of Tripolitania. This should be encouraged and developed by replacing as rapidly as possible the shifting native cultivation by static agriculture on a rotational crop basis and by the introduction of higher yielding strains, and the improvement of the sheep and cattle stock. For these 1 purposes, the uncertainty of the rainfall would point to an exhaustive survey of underground water resrouces with a view to irrigation. There is scope for further development of industry concerned with processing of domestic products, such as the canning of animal products, fish, vegetables and fruit. It is unlikely that the exports of beef and mutton from this Territory would justify a separate refrigerator plant, though it might be /economicallyeconomically practicable to undertake a joint venture in such a plant for the two Territories of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. Other secondary industry which might flow from the export of meat, instead of the export of cattle on the hoof, might be tanning, leather working and processing of hoofs and horns. 7# Necessary or desirable projects which might form the Jgiasis of a short-term development programme are shown in the Attached list which also include estimates of the expenditure involved.TRIPOLITAN IA SUBJECT ESTIMATED SUM RKQITTRWT) Education £ 92 ,OfO Medical 37,000 Agriculture and Animal Husbandry 115,000 Ports and Harbours 226,000 Electricity Supply 200,000 Water Survey 60,000 Roads 100,000 Agricultural Schemes 20,800 Housing and Water Supply 75,000 Miscellaneous Agriculture and Irrigation Services 75,000 Asrioultupa^. and ,Oto&lt; 3 Ustrlal Credits 500,000 Total £1,500,008 Iia£e - Estimated additional annual recurrent charges- would be about - £ 175,000III. BRITREA (i) General !• Eritrea has an area of approximately 48,0.00 square miles varying from sea level to over 8,000 feet. About 1 million acres only can be classed as agricultural land, the remaining ' 29 i million acres consisting of rocky, mountainous areas quite useless for cultivation. The population is estimated at a little over 1,000,000 inhabitants, including about 26,000 Europeans, mostly Italians. 2. This country possesses, in even greater degree than Libya, the characteristic features of over urbanisation, with its large capital at Asmara, a town of about 110,000 inhabitants, 7,600 feet above sea level. The standard of amenities and of utilities such as electric lighting and power is unusually high, roads are good and there is a remarkable railway constructed by the Italians in very difficult mountainous country. In present circumstances, the structure is top heavy; the foundations are quite unsubstantial. 3. Agriculture is generally poor and backward. For the most part productive land in areas of adequate rainfall is already overcropped. Some room for immediate expansion exists in the Western Highlands, where fairly extensive stretches of virgin soil still exist. Here the proximity of the Ethiopian border, with consequent danger from raiding parties from Ethiopia and the prevalence of malaria, have deterred settlers. The introduction of machinery and modern methods and irrigation schemes mainly of a long-term character would be expected to achieve some permanent improvement, but the nature of the country is such that the prospects of any large- scale development in the agricultural field are not very encouraging. Up to the xjeriod of the British Administration, no serious effort appears to have been made to impart .any agricultural education to the natives and agricultural practice is of an extremely low standard. As a result of the inadequacy of its agricultural resources the country is dependent for a very great part of its foodstuffs on importation, much of which is from the Tigre District of Ethiopia. 4. Livestock breeding forms one of the principal occupations in Eritrea. Cattle, sheep and goats are all kept in considerable numbers. In this field, as in Agriculture, however, the backwardness o f the natives and the -inadequacy of their lands limit and detract from the value of their activities. Since the number of animals possessed rather than their quality is the accepted criterion of wealth, overstocking has resulted, particularly of goats which cause devastation of afforestation and herbage with resulting acceleration of soil erosion. 3* Again, as a result of ignorance and profligacy, the forestry resources of Eritrea have been severely depleted over generations. The present British Administration has been fully alive to the importance of conserving trees and shrubs primarily to protect the soil, but no major schemes for re-afforestation could be contemplated during a ’’Care and Maintenance ” Administration. At the present time, therefore, although the economic life of the country depends very largely on activities in the agricultural and pastoral fields, since there is little else on which it can depend, the fruits of these activities are meagre, and even the implementation of carefully considered plans for irrigation, re-afforestation, agricultural /education2 - 10 - © education and re-deployment of population is unlikely alone to enable the Eritreans to achieve any really appreciable increase in their standard of living, 6, In the industrial field the prospects are no mire encouraging. During the Italian Regime the major industry was the preparation for Italy’s war with Ethiopia, In that period the Italian population, engaged upon mounting operations against the Ethiopians and maintaining road transport there, a formidable task, multiplied from 6,000 to 60,000, Capital works on a lavish scale wore undertaken but of industry of a lasting kind there was little or none, rho country depended upon Italy for practically all supplies of manufactured goods and for considerable quantities of When the British arrived in 1941* therefore, they found themselves confronted, on the one hand, by wartime shortages and restrictions upon imports and, upon the other, by considerable potentialities in the form of skilled European labour and workshop facilities. Their immediate therefore, was to utilise the available skill to oil set the shortages as far as possible, with the result that now rninor industries were established. The principal 0 + v 0 ? 0 v/or ? tlalotti Brewery and Distillery, glass and match factories and factories producing buttons from Dum palm nuts, A variety of other industries were also established but, with one or two exceptions, they are rather of a mushroom character and few are likely to survive as conditions of normal production in other countries return. Eor the time being, however, the export of goods produced by these industries forms an important factor in the country’s economy, though the value of these exports added to the more natural exports of hides and skins and salt, etc., io still insufficient to pay for the large imports which the country requires. 7» Ihe mineral resources of the country have not yet been fully explored -and, while such superficial surveys as have been made indicate that prospects are not altogether lacking, it is not yet possible to foresee what, if any, part the exploitation of any mineral deposits might play in the future of the economic life of the country. (H) Present Fln anci al Position 1* yt h }} G * indicated in the previous paragraph, exports from Eritrea have been stimulated since the British Occupation by the establishment of a number of new industries, it has not boon po.*c:i hi 0 ovan with the assistance oi these to reduce the gap between visible imports and oxports to any appreciable* extent.

Confined within a policy of Care and Maintenance, the present British Administration has been in no position to plan, let alone implement any plans for economic development. Nor, of course, could any plans be made botore fairly extensive surveys had been undertaken and completed. It may well be doubted, however, whether alone the territory could become a viable economic unit, unless geophysical survey disclosed evidences of natural mineral resources so far unsuspec ted c y* ^ event of Kis Majesty’s Government continuing to have responsibility for the administration of the territory, surveys and planning ^ould initially be directed towards 01 3Uch Potential local resources as wore wnni t t0 ya oinic possibilities.

Somalia has a population of about 1,000,000 inhabitants of which 3,000 are Europeans, mainly Italians, domiciled for the most part in the town of Mogadishu. The natural resources of the Territory, the economic life of which is mainly dependent on pastoral mid agricultural produce, are very limited and the standard of living of the local inhabitants is poor. In the past, recurring tribal wars, famine and disease limited the rate of increase of the population. 2* During the Italian regime, which ended with the occupation of the Territory by British Forces in February, 1941, there was some development both social and economic, but the social services provided for the indigenes was on a very limited scale and the primary object of activities in the economic field was the promotion of Italian colonisation. The indigenes did, of course, derive some benefit from the employment provided on Italian farms in the Genale and Juba aioas, by the S.A.I.S. sugar factory and plantations, by the Dante Salt Works, by Italian tunny fishing concerns aid in other ways directly and indirectly from Italian activities. 3. War and preparations for war (italian-Sthiopian) brought a degree of spurious prosperity to the country and a widening gap between imports and exports was met from Italian expenditure in the country in preparing for, and during the conduct of, their Ethiopian campaign. In the period of British Occupation, from February, 1941, to the present time, the gap has persisted and has been covered mainly by British Administration and British Military expenditure in the country. (II) Present Financial Position. 1. The British Administration has done everything possible, within a care and maintenance policy and in face of world shortages and the general disorganisation of trade resulting from the war, to^improve the economic life of the Territory, and to achieve limited development. The external trade of the country has steadily increased as the following figures show:- Imports £ 1942 341,180 1945 770,249 1948 1?113,423 It is hoped that in the oxceod £1, 000,000.

During the Italian regime the mast important export was of Bananas, fostered and, indeed, made possible only by the sotting up by Italy of a Banana Monopoly. During the war, however, not only was the Italian market closed but it was essential to use irrigated land for the production of staple food-stuffs, such as maize, so that, until recently, the production of bananas fell to a negligible quantity. On the other hand, imports of native feeding stuffs, principally maize, which in Italian times were considerable, bocemio and continued to be comparatively small. The principal exports in recent years have been of livestock, hides and skins and animal fats and the value of those has risen from £70,000 in 1943 to £380,000 in 1947- With the re-opening of the Italian market, however, banana production has recommenced and a production of between 6,000 and 7,000 tons this year is anticipated. 3. The present annual Budgetary Deficit of the British Administration is in the region of £350,000. din The Possi bilit ies _pf Sconoralc Development. 1. While some minor developments in the economic field have already been achieved and others arc contemplated, the possibilities for many years of achieving any major developments so as to render the Territory a viable economic unit are not considered to bo very great. In any case, any such major development projects which might emerge as a result of more extensive surveys than have as yet been made, could not be undertaken in the present position of uncertainty as to the future of the Territory. Should His Majesty’s Government be required to continue for some time to be responsible for the Administration of the Territory, it is probable that any plans for major development would be concerned initially with expansion in the agricultural and pastoral fields. This would, in turn, give rise to increased commercial activity and the development of industrial activities already undertaken. Meantime, in certain directions, some progress is already being made. 2. The Salt Works in the Mijertein Province, which ceased production in 1941, will, it is hoped, be again functioning in the near future, A stock pile of approximately 500,000 tons of salt is available for export -and, provided that difficulties with regard to essential machinery replacements can be overcome, production can be restarted so as to continue exports when these stocks are cleared. 3. The tunny fishing industry is progressing steadily. During the 1948/49 season production was 150 tons but the plant is capable of higher production and it is anticipated that the present season will produce increased results. 4. As has been indicated above, banana production has been restarted and is steadily increasing. 5. In 1948 some 1,000 tons of groundnuts were shipped to Italy. — -•-14- I’hc-j cultivation of cotton^ which ceased during the war years owing to priority being given to the cultivation of native staple foodstuffs, was restarted in 1945. Seed was distributed to natives in the Juba area and to European farmers in the Afgoe area. The result of this tirst attempt has been a production of 130 tons of ginned fntif/Vi °f l ^° t0 ?

The three loan schemes referred to in paragraph 5 are expected to be self supporting, and they represent important factors in the Colony^ progress. The telephone development plan provides for the installation of a now exchange which would commence with about 2,000 direct exchange lines and would be capable of enlargement in due course. It also provides for an extension of the urban distribution system of cables and overhead wires according to a ten-year plan. This scheme is regarded as being entirely satisfactory from a commercial point of view, and the estimated annual revenue of £ 30,000 from 1,000 telephones would bo adequate to defray interest, maintenance and operating charges, 7 # The electricity scheme is based upon the importance of providing sufficient power to meet present demand and the possible industrial development in the future. It is proposed to construct' a now power station with two new 5&gt;000 kilowa. tt generating sets. This, and the construction of a new hospital are the two most costly items in the Colony’s development programme, 8, The Colony of Aden obtains its water supply from a number of semi-artesian wells situated near the suburb of Shaikh Othmcn, about eight miles from the main town of Aden, Water is piped in from those wells and provides a supply not only for the needs of the town but also for sale to ships calling at the port of ^den. It is now proposed to make five additional bore-holes at Sheikh Othman, and this plan would bring the maximum amount of water which it would be possible to raise to about 4,000,000 gallons per day. The scheme also provides for a new reservoir in the town of ^den and the laying of new pipe lines, 9, It will be seen that a large sum has been allocated to the construction of roads, and another important development is the creation of a. Civil Airport, 10, New educational plans which will be of importance to the Aden Protectorate as well as to the Colony of Aden are the establishing of an Aden College and a Trade School, and additional schools for both boys and girls are contemplated to meet the growing demand for education in the Colony, Jl* The prosperity of Aden is bound up with the fortunes of its port which has been a fine port for nearly 100 years and those are in turn largely dependent upon the fact that it is an oil fuelling port of call of the first importance on the main shipping route from Europe to the East, (The Aden Port Trust is a statutory and semi-autonomous body controlled, under the supervision of the Government of Aden, by a Board of /Trusto es,..- 3 - Trustees), The Angl o-*I rani an Oil Corapany (Aden) Limited (who handle the bunkering business of Shell at the port) have now seven submarine pipe linos serving bunkering berths on the &lt;outh side of the harbour, while Galtex Oil (Aden) Limited, whose installation was erected in 1946, have throe submarine pipe lines serving bunkering berths on the North side of the harbour. In the first full year of bunkering operations, which was in 1920, deliveries were made to only 98 vessels, but in 1947 the vessels bunkered by the l..1,0, (Aden) Limited amounted to 1,453 merchant vessels, and 87 tankers were discharged, while Caltex Oil (Aden) limited bunkered 205 vessels and discharged 15 tankers, 12# Stock of furno.oo, diesel and gas oil are maintained and the storage capacity lias increased by over fourfold since 1918, when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited first decided tc: instal facilities at Aden, To maintain the high efficiency of their bunkering installation the A,1,0, (Aden) Limited are understood to be installing additional pumping plant and replacing pipe—lines as well as providing additional small craft for the work of their organisation; while Caltex Oil (Aden/Limited are bringing a fourth oil terminal into operation* 13* The port of Aden handles 1,000,000 tons of shipping a month, and the continued expansion of its business has led the Trustees of the Port to consider plans for expansion in conjunction with the Government of the Colony. A scheme for a reclamation to provide sites for new wharves and accommodation for coolies on the North side of the harbour is new under consideration. It is designed to relieve congestion on the South si^.o of the harbour and to provide improved facilities for ships and better housing for the workers. 14. Until comparatively times tbe Protecting Power intervened hardly at all in the affairs of the Protectorate, v/ith the result that large parts of it were in a very backward and disturbed condition* The work of pacification was eventually undertaken, and this has prepared the way for a certain amount of economic development* The total sum allotted jointly to the Colony of Aden and the Protectorate from'Colonial Development and Welfare Funds amounts to £800,000, of which the*Aden Development Committee advised that £500,000 should be allotted to the Protectorate* A list of the schemes which they advised to be undertaken in the Protectorate is attached. (Appendix II)• These proposals have been approved with modifications in certain cases. 15* One of the great difficulties v/hich must be faced before any attempt at development in the Protectorate on a large scale can be successful, is that of transport* At present there are no roads which would be so designated in any up-to-date country* It will be seen that it is therefore proposed to spend a sum of up to £100,000 for the construction of roads. /16..*16* Minerals have not so far* been discovered in the Protectorate, and the most important activity to be encouraged in it is that of agriculture* For this purpose increased water supplies and improved irrigation schemes are prime necessities, and it will be seen that the development programme devotes the sum of £ 300,000 to this object. The most important project of this nature is the Abyan Irrigation Scheme* 17« Abyan is a district about 30 to i40 miles to the North-East of Aden, through which two river beds pass from the mountains of the interior to the sea coast. In the past local Arab irrigation dams and channels have not been sufficient to prevent a large proportion of the water that passes at certain seasions down these river beds escaping to the sea. In recent years an Abyan Board has been set up for the improvement and conservation of existing irrigation works in this area, and a grant of £20,000 was made to this Board in 1946. Now a further interest-free loan from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund of £230,000 has been approved, and with this assistance it is hoped to accomplish two principal purposes. The first and main objective is to determine how much of the Abyan area can be brought under cultivation by controlled irrigation. To do this it is necessary to collect as much data as possible regarding water resources, run off, survey levels, operating costs, etc*, during a period of at least three years. The second objective is to bring land which is known to be suitable under irrigation and cultivation as quickly as possible. It is hoped that a total of 120,000 acres may be irrigable. At the same time it is reliably estimated that a minimum of 30,000 to 40,000 acres can be watered without difficulty each year and the scheme x^rovideo for bringing 28,000 acres of this area under irrigation control during this three-year period. The development of these 28,000 acres will in itself provide valuable data for further development of the irrigation system. 18. The effect of such an irrigation scheme, the first of its kind and scale in Southern Arabia, is bound to be felt in other parts of the Protectorate and is likely to be the forerunner of similar if smaller schemes. The prosperity of Abyan and its inhabitants should be greatly enhanced by the increased production which should result from the scheme, and the people of neighbouring areas of the Protectorate and in the Colony of Aden should benefit by the increased production of cheaper food. It is hoped that the agricultural development of this area will obviate the danger of famine which is a recurrent evil in the Eastern Aden Protectorate and to a lesser degree a frequent threat in the Western Aden Protectorate. 19. It will be seen from Apx&gt;endix II that educational, medical and public health schemes are also being undertaken in the Protectorate. Among the latter the anti-malarial measures are particularly important in connexion with the irrigation scheme for Abyan, a district in which malaria is rife if it is not checked.f ^ V INDEXES (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S The attached paper prepared by the Committee’s Working Party is circulated to the Committee for information.

CONCLUSIONS G# RECOMMENDATIONSA INTRODUCTION 1 • Present Political Situation The Government and administration is largely tribal and patriarchal, all authority flowing from the King and his sons Saud and Faisal, Viceroys of the Ne^d and of the Hejaz res pectively. There are three Ministries, of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Defence (originally War) a fourth, that of Internal Affairs has long been absorbed in the Offices of the Viceroy of Hejaz* Other subordinate departments include a Public Health Administration, a Directoratecf'Schools, a Department of Waqfs, a Department of Pilgrimage Affairs, the local treasuries or 'Beit ul Mai”, a Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs, a Department of Agriculture and the Customs and Coastguard Departments. These Departments and Ministries which seek to administer the affairs of a Kingdom of perhaps 5,000,000 with an income from oil royalties alone which in 1948 amounted to 3*8 million gold sovereigns, and this year will probably be about Ui million gold sovereigns, are in fact slightly remodelled versions of the old Turkish administrative offices of the Vilayet of the Hejaz. In any consideration of social, and economic affairs in Saudi Arabia the fact that there is hardly the semblance of a normal government machinery must be borne in mind. Moreover, there is little written legislation, and the interpretation of the old Sharia law is often arbitrary; except for certain figures on the numbers of persons making the pilgrimage, there is no published statistical information, and it is doubtful whether even in the private archives of the government any reliable figures exist except as regards imports and exports. The machinery of Government therefore is quite inadequate to direct any large-scale plans of development. There is no appreciable educated class, and only a very modest start has been made by foreign companies (notably Aramco and Bechtel) in training native technicians. The Government’s continual financial difficulties, which spring mainly from widespread inefficiency and corruption prevent the establishment of any real confidence among foreign investors. 2. General Economic Background Saudi Arabia consists of most of the Arabian Peninsula, with the exception of its more lofty and fertile southern fringe, and /jplus on the north a considerable area of the Syrian desert. It consists, in fact, of the greater part of one of the/greatest and most inhospitable desert areas in the world, with no dependable rainfall, and, so far as is known, very limited water resources. The few .large centres of population are spread over vast distances; while except for the 45 miles stretch between Mecca and Jedda, and a few miles at Riyadh and in the oilfields, there is no metalled road in the country. The population is variously estimated at between 3 and 6 millions, but is probably nearer the latter figure; the majority are nomad Bedouin. B. FINANCE 1• Currency The currency of Saudi Arabia is the Saudi Arabian riyal, a silver coin of the same size, weight and fineness as the old Indian silver rupee. There is no larger piece, and no paper currency. At the present price of free silver, the face value /and/3 - 2 - and intrinsic value of this coin are approximately equal* hut *^ ^he silver price level ruling in the Bombay bullion market it is a potentially profitable transaction to smuggle the coin into India and melt it down* As the currency is on a bullion basis, its backing being its own silver content, it is manifestly liable to violent fluctuations in value, a tendency which is aggravated by the long standing custom of the Hejaz money-changers of 'rigging” the local exchange rates in order to fleece foreign pilgrims (and the Government)as they enter and leave the country. These fluctuations have a most adverse affect on the foreign trade of the country, creating as they do a constant uncertainty. Furthermore, the country has suffered and continues to suffer a considerable inflation. The total number of riyals minted has increased nearly fifteen fold since 1939 &gt; while the situation is further complicated by a constant, but incalculable, drain of silver smuggled out as bullion. The local price of the riyal is at present low against the dollar, and the need for dollars for purchases in the United States and elsewhere offsets, to some extent, the tendency to smuggle riyals out of Saudi Arabia as bullion. Whereas in pre-war years the riyal was considered to be worth about one twentieth of a gold pound (riyals 10 to £1 sterling in 1939 ) and present exchange rate against the sovereign is about sixty to the gold pound. The Government have realised the evil effects of these fluctuations, which press hard on the population by encouraging the merchants to cover themselves against possible falls in the exchange value of the riyal by charging still more exorbitant prices than they would normally. It also makes it impossible for the Government to make any accurate estimate of its expenses, as the Government must buy most of its requirements of riyals in the open market at constantly fluctuating rates of exchange. Various schemes have therefore been mooted for the stabilisation of the riyal at a value acceptable to the Government, and the advice of both British and United States experts has been solicited. Up to date, however, the Government has proved unwilling to take the plunge in favour of any of these schemes, being probably deterred principally by the fact that they would all involve the renouncement of arbitrage profits; and their realisation that the necessary machinery and sanctions are lacking. The British Bank of Iran in the Middle Bast has just opened in Saudi Arabia; the Eastern Bank has applied to open, and the British firm of Gellatley Hankey act as bankers. Adequate British banking facilities should therefore now be available. The French Banque d^ndo-Chine is well established in the country. 2. Internal R evenu es As a result, lack of confidence in the Government in financial matters persists in the country and is aggravated by the fact that the Government is well known to be living right up to the limit of its means. The Government^ internal revenues are small in the extreme. The only substantial single source of revenue are the Customs receipts, which in the last budget estimate,published (that for the Muslim year 1367. corresponding roughly to 194 °) are shown as producing. !o, 000 , 00(3 riyals (a fg$!Mo§ f a£H t l£ 82 te enue pilgrimage dues (T 8 , 000,000 riyalsj which are not strictly internal revenues, as the money is imported and collected in foreign exchange, total only about 31 &gt; 000,000 riyals, of which nearly 7 , 000,000 is Income of a commercial as distinct from a revenue character, being the takings of the Posts and Telegraphs, of Saudi Arabian Airlines, and the like.-3~ 3# Revenues in Foreign Exchange ^ By comparison with its exiguous resources of internal revenue, Saudi Arabia^ annual and fairly regular foreign exchange revenues are considerable* The latest calculations, which take recent wind-falls and changes in oil production into account, show that these revenues are likely in 1949 to be asfbllows: all figures are necessarily approximate: (a) Oil Royalties from Aramco (This figure is based on royalties for the first 9 months of 1949 * In September production was reduced and this reduction may continue). ARAMCO*s local expenditure: &amp; Government Pilgrimage Dues £ Sterling Local Expenditure by pilgrims £ Sterling ARAMCO^ royalties for off-shore oil in the Persian Gulf: &amp; Oil royalties from the Pacific Western Oil Company for the concession to exploit the* Saudi-Arabian share of the central Zone between Saudi- Arabia and Kuwait: &amp; £:Gold 4 , 700,000 25 , 000,000 2 , 500,000 7,500,000 2 , 000,000 minimum 1 , 000,000 minimum (In addition to Pacific Western Oil Company have recently made a once-only down payment of # 9 , 500,000 to the Saudi Government). In subsequent years revenue from these sources will be augmented by revenue from the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company whose total expenditure in Saudi Arabia will probably be #1 25,000,000 approximately. Of this some will be local expenditure. Local expenditure will continue after pipeline has been completed. Details of the agreement are not available - it has not yet been signed with the Saudi Arabian Government - but the Government are said to have been promised not less favourable terms than those the Company may accord other Governments. Saudi Arabia is in fact the largest gold and dollar earner in the Middle East. This condition of comparative affluence however has only existed since 1946 , v/hen the output of oil turned sharply upwards. Before that date the Government was constantly overdrawn on its royalties. Despite the con siderable income accruing from oil and other revenues, the Government is in constant financial difficulties, largely of its •own. making, from improvident spending and inadequate (if not non-existent) budgetary control. These difficulties are clearly apparent to local business circles, and when combined with the well-known inefficiency and corruption of the Government, and the anticipated falling-off in oil royalties in consequence of the cut-back in production, prevent the establishment of any real confidenc . The Government's revenue is now fully absorbed by the public-works projects at present in hand. Until there is a marked improvement in the Government's financial situation which can probably only be effected by financial reforms and increased efficiency (since they cannot rely on discovering large fresh sources of revenue), it is not practicable to think in tersm of ambitious new projects involving further large capital expenditure. C. ECONOMIC AND SOCLkL DEVELOPMENT The first essential for the development of Saudi Arabia /is-4~ is manifestly the establishment of a sound internal financial system, which in its turn will allow of the stabilisation of the riyal, or of some new medium of exchange. The first impulse towards such a development must however come from the Government itself. Any endeavour to force it on them would irritate their national pride, not to mention the vested interests, and would certainly meet with an obstinate resistance. It may well be that nothing short of a really grave financial crisis will drive them to take any serious measures to put their house in order. Concurrently, the continuation of capital investment in Saudi Arabia by the Oil Companies will have a natural stimulating effect, both by providing foreign exchange, and also in that their operations will have great influence in inculcating into the masses of their workers a knowledge and appreciation of modern technical processes, and are likely to have a larger educative effect than any scheme of formal training which can be foreseen in the reasonably near future. Lastly, it is desirable that the Government should be encouraged to ensure that such projects as they undertake, in the way of public services, and amenities and communications should be economic, both in the sense that costs should be kept to a reasonable figure and that the projects should be self-supporting. On the other hand, modern urban amerities are having and will have a considerable indirect value in promoting a higher standard of living, and also in the training of increasing numbers of Saudi Arabian employees. So far there has been practically no progress in the sphere of sodal services, while economically what progress there has been was rather the inevitable result of a great accession of wealth than of any attempt at planned development. A number of projects of undoubted usefulness are in progress. They are however mainly necessary public services rather than directly productive projects, and a number of projects of doubt ful economic value have already been undertaken by the Government and its contractors, the American firm of Messrs. Bechtel McCoon. 1 • Agriculture Even at the present generally .very low standard of living Saudi Arabia is a net importer of foodstuffs. Except in the south western province of Asir, which benefits from the fringe of the monsoon rains, cultivation is only possible in a restricted number of cases. The only general agricultural survey of the country ever carried out, the United States Agricultural Mission to Saudi Arabia of 1942, visited typical areas throughout the country and its report, published in 1943 , suggests that there is comparatively little scope for agricultural development. There are areas where new land could be brought under cultivation by drainage, or by improved methods of local irrigation, or where land at present cultivated only seasonally could be irrigated throughout the year by building small dams, but it is most unlikely that any great increase in the numbers of the settled population is possible, or that the country could ever become self-supporting in food grains. A more extensive survey would, however, be required before a categorical statement on this could be made. /T he-5- The staple crop throughout the country is dftp 3 -? and of these some are exported. Whether, however, with better internal transport facilities this surplus, which arises mainly in the north east on the Persian Gulf ® oas ^» ^? u ^ d not he absorbed inside the country is a moot point. Wheat and sorghums are grown fairly generally, as are pass crops for fodder. Citrus fruits, grapes, pomegranates, apricots, and peaches and other fruits are grown on a small sc a p in the mountains of the Hejaz and in the neighbourhood of Aneiza, and some market gardening is carried on near to the larger towns. Improved methods would undoubtedly increase yields in every case, but except in the case oi dates (for which there is as yet no packing plant ^ country) and perhaps almonds in the Asir, there is prospect of doing more than meeting the local demand. The only existing project of which great things were hoped is the A1 Kharj agricultural project, Arabian American Oil Company at the request of the ^overnmen by a United States Government Mission m 1942, and taken over by Arabian American Oil Company in 1943. This could, and should, serve as an experimental station where eeeds and methods suitable to the requirements ^f S pp pad Arabian agriculture would be tested and developed, instead It has come to be merely a market garden on the grand scale for the supply of foodstuffs, fruit and vegetables to the Royal Household in Riyadh. Latterly, however, difficulties have been met with because of soil salinity and b ecause of the refusal of the Saudi Arabian authorities to allow fields to He fallow or systematic rotation of crops to be foxlowea, production has therefore fallen sharply. Further similar schemes, on a smaller scale, are now being developed, under the auspices of the Minister of Finance, at Hofuf and Ketif, while the Minister of Finance has instituted a private scheme at Dammam. From 1942 to 1947 the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit carried out extensive campaigns against the desert locust ^ in Saudi Arabia. The Government did not contribute financially to these campaigns, but facilities were provided and an atmosphere of friendly co-operation developed between the Unit (who travelled in many little known parts of the country) nd the local authorities. The Unit’s work is now being on in a modified form by the Desert Locust Survey, which based in Nairobi. 2 f Animal Husbandry Animal husbandry, the herding of camels, sheep, goats and horses, and in Hasa province the raising of a particularly fine type of white donkey, was until very few years ago the staple industry of the bulk of the bedouin population of the interior, but this is rapidly changing with the advent of the motor car as the normal means of desert transport. Camels, sheep and hides are exported to Iraq, Syria and Egypt, ^ ut the emphasis is now on the beast of burden and the butcher s needs, rather than on the costly riding camel of other days. Horse breeding in Arabia is almost dead. These have impoverished the tribes so far as their traditional of income is conaerned, but in compensation some few have been partially settled on the land in recent years by Ibn Saud and /a/ 6. - 6 - a certain amount reaches the tribes from the oil developments in Hasa (in remittances from their relatives or more indirectly). It is also of interest that in the current financial year ^ approximately £ 1 , 000,000 is being paid to the tribes in the subsidies which go some way to alleviating their age-old lot of being on the verge of starvation. This represents an increase of over 100 % on the figures originally budgeted for. Minerals other than oil The only mineral other than oil so far located in commercially workable quantities in Saudi Arabia is gold and the copper, silver and some other metals found in conjunction with it. Gypsum is also quarried. The precious metals are being extracted by modern chemiqal processes by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate f a nominally British. Company having mainly American capital, at Mahad Danab, roughly half way between Jedda and Medina 0 The undertaking is, however, not very large and there is so far no guarantee that any alternative site can be found to which activity could be transferred when the existing mine is worked out (probably in 2 or 3 years time). Surveys are, however, continuing in half a dozen areas under the direction of Karl Peters, an American mining consultant employed by the Government, who is confident that minerals are to be found in economically worth-while quantities in some at least of those areas. Apart from this, rock salt is quarried at Jizan near the Yemen border, and a cement plant is to be constructed at Damman on the Persian Gulf. Thee are rumours that a glass factory, for which sands found on the East coast would make excellent raw material, is to be built also. h. Oil It is on oil that the present wealth of Saudi Arabia is based. (Previously its revenues depended on the pilgrimage). The Arabian American Oil Company (originally the Californian Standard Oil Company) obtained.a concession covering the eastern portion of Nejd in 1933 , and the concession was subsequently progressively extended to cover the greater part of the country. The renunciation of certain areas has begun but this will not involve the Saudi Arabian Government in any loss of revenue. Oil was discovered in commercial quantities in 1938 , and since that date both production and proved reserves have steadily increased. Current production is at the rate of about 450,000 barrels per day, and for a period of three days in late 1948 off-take was experimentally stepped up to a maximum of nearly 600,000 barrels a day. If demand warranted it, and if sufficient tankers or pipeline capacity and stabilisers were available to transport the oil, this rate could, it is believed, be maintained indefinitely. Three fields are at present in operation and four others are under investigation and development. The Arabian American Oil Company has a wide programme of development and capital expenditure; the construction of a pipeline to Sidon ? a port in the Lebanon is also proposed, 5# Water supp lx If adequate supplies can be located, the Government is planning for the provision of piped water to Mecca, Yenbo and other towns.-7- 6 « Gommunlcations The Government has in progress a number of projects of which the most important are connected with communications. Deep water jetties are under construction at Jedda, and at ^ Damman on the east coast. The road from Jedda to Medina is to be graded and metalled, and there is talk of doubling the road from Jedda to Mecca, A railway is under construction from Dhahran and Damman to Riyadh, though it is doubtful when or whether it will be taken beyond Abquiq.in the oil fields; despite favourable reports by the American engineers who conducted the survey for the line, it is questionable whether its extension to Riyadh would be an economic proposition. In addition, the Government-owned Saudi-Arabian Airlines provide an effective, if irregular, system of trans-peninsular air services. Other projects of lesser economic importance, although of great value in instilling an appreciation of higher standards of living, are the supply of electricity to Jedda, Mecca and Taif, to be followed shortly by Medina, and the provision of a pure and adequate water supply for Jedda, This last, although not complete, is already operative, and is of the greatest benefit to the health and comfort of the town people. There is also a Government scheme for the installation of modern telephone systems in the towns of the Hejaz, 7# Education Educational facilities are restricted and rudimentary, and are confined entirely to the towns. There are a fairly large number of Coranic schools teaching reading, writing and religious subjects only: otherwise the existing schools are: (a) Government primary schools in each of the main towns, (b) Secondary schools at Jedda, Mecca, Medina and Taif where English is taught: a privately run secondary school at Jedda, (c) An establishment called the ’'Saudi school for Overseas Missions at Mecca with the function of preparing selected students for universities elsewhere, (d) The Arabian-American oil company have undertaken an educational scheme at Dharan which is mainly intended to benefit their own operations by raising the standard of their intake of labour but which has received some government encouragement. There are no facilities for university education; and the upper classes have to go to Beirut or elsewhere for further training. Until recently medical work in Saudi Arabia was conducted almost entirely by Syrians. A small group of Syrian doctors was established at Jedda under a Syrian director for public health. In 1948, however, a British public health expert, Doctor Corkill, and an expert in pathology, Colonel Manifold were appointed to advise on the re-organisation of the health services with particular reference to the pilgrim quarantine arrangements, and a British eye specialist. Doctor Longinotto has been working for the past 2-g- years in • the Jedda Government General Hospital. In addition, a field ambulance, manned by two German doctors, has been travelling round the interior. /The- 8 - The British advisers appointed hy the Government have proposed a large scale plan of reorganisation and development for the country's health services. Already three million riyals have Been allocated hy the Government for this purpose ^ and it is intended to enlarge the hospital at Jedda and to build a new eye hospital there, and also to build a hospital at Damman on the Persian Gulf. A hospital with IhO beds has also recently been opened in Mecca. A school for training sanitary inspectors is to be established at Jedda and a Sudanese Public Health Inspector is to be appointed. Recommendations for starting a school for training nurses, midwives and health visitors, under British direction, have been made. Under Dr. Gorkill's direction large-scale fly disinfestation is being carried out in a number of towns. These measures, cannot, however, be implemented without some improvement of the existing administrative machinery. The first requirement would appear to be the establishment Of a Ministry of Health, under a Minister capable of implementing a programme in the face of opposition. D. EMPLOYMENT OP EXPERTS Apart from the British Military Mission and the British Civil Air Training Mission (whose scope is very restricted) the only non-commercial foreign experts as distinct from foreigners employed in subordinate positions in the country, are the two British health experts, and various doctors, including a British Ophthalmologist. With these exceptions, and apart from the advice of financial experts already mentioned and from an Egyptian Financial and 'Fiscal Mission which arrived in the summer of 1949 &gt; no request has been made for the services of any foreign experts in an advisory capacity. E* 'FOURTH POINT' ASSISTANCE ^ 1 - - TT - '-I The Saudi Arabian Government recently asked the American Embassy at Jedda whether American plans for 'fourth point ” assistance could include a water survey. The State Depar-tment have welcomed this idea and have asked the Saudi Government to submit a list of projects in other fields, particularly agriculture, forestry and industrial training, which they would like to see implemented. This offer presumably refers to bilateral assistance, and indicates that the Americans may be planning to provide such assistance to Saudi Arabia on a considerable scale. Ft CONCLUSIONS Saudi Arabia is still a mediaeval state and the danger of the spread of communism is remote. Nevertheless, the impact . of Western civilisation is beginning increasingly to be felt (mainly through the Oil Company) and when the heavy hand of the present patriarchal king has gone, it is possible that Western ideas and methods will be introduced with greater rapidity. The economy of the country is almost entirely d 3 pendent on oil and this commodity has now become a source of hitherto unheard of wealth to a Government which is remarkable even in the Middle East for its conservatism. The country's outstanding need is therefore for guidance along the lines /of/ -9- o£ orderly social progress and 'balanced economic development, in order to ensure stability as the impact of the outside world becomes more pronounced, and to provide for the wise use of the new wealth. Naturally, American Oil interests give the U.S. a position of special influence, and, although British mercantile representation in the country has a long and honourable record, American commercial interests are now well established. Nevertheless, British political influence with the King remains very great and our moral prestige in the country is high. There is thus considerable scope for indirect assistance to the development of the country, by (a) the general exercise oX our political influence, (b) the provision of technical advice^ and (c) the expansion of British trade, particularly in capital equipment.

Annex III Annex IV Annex V Annex VI Annex VII#■/ Introduction The Lebanon Economic and Social Development Though the smallest, both from the point of view of population and of area, of all the Member States of the Arab League, the Lebanon is in many respects the most remarkable# Its climate is undoubtedly the best in the Middle East# The standard of living of the greater part of the population is comparatively high. Public Health is by Middle East standards good# Education facilities are considerable and illiteracy is in many parts of the country virtually unknown# The language of the country is of course Arabic# Individual initiative and enterprise exist in a high degree and are reflected in the large number of Lebanese emigrants to be found in all parts of the world# It is in fact estimated that there are as many Lebanese living abroad as there are in the Lebanon. The merchants of Beirut are well known for the commercial skill and experience# In spite of the diversity of sects (roughly half the population is Christian and Half Moslem) the various elements live together in relative harmony. In general the Lebanese are the least xenophobic in the Middle East and it is not without justification that the Lebanon has been described as a?'Aatural bridge between the East and the West# Economically the Lebanon is very much an enigma# The possibilities of development are considerable though clearly not on the scale possible in Egypt, Iraq and Syria# The country*s main physical resource is water and its use both for irrigation and the development of hydro-electric power should be exploited to the maximum. In the interests of stability, particularly as the destructive forces of Communism are not without appeal in some semi-education quarters in the Lebanon, opportunities of economic and social development should not be missed# 2 # Population No. reliable census has ever been taken# The last official census was taken in 193 2 # That taken in 1943 ih connexion with the Cereals Collection Scheme gives the total population at l f 064.000 of which 33*9His urban and 66.5$ rural. Approximately half the population is Christian and half Moslem# Having regard to the limited resources of the country there is no doubt that the Lebanon is at present over populated# The rate of population increase is estimated kt 16$ and unless possibilities for emigration intervene a total population may reach 2 , 000,000 by 1967. In view of its present over-population and the substantial increase rate, the possibilities of resettlement of Palestine refugees are clearly limited# It is true that in the past the country has shown a surprising capacity for absorbing immigrants# During the past three decades some 200,000 Armenians were resettled in Syria and Lebanon (since 1946 many of these have elected to be •'repatriated 11 to Soviet Armenia) and more recently Christian elements from Syria have established themselves in Beirut. In general Lebanese, particularly Christian, take pride in their country’s role as a place of refuge in the Middle East. Nevertheless the Lebanese G-ovemment have indicated that they are unable to agree to the resettlement of Palestinian refugees-3- The present Christ!an-Moslom population ratio (the dominant factor in Lobanoso politics; rosultod from tho inclusion in tho Creator Lebanon of the largely Moslem areas of tho Boqaa, Tripoli, and Akkar. Maintenance of this arrangomont (offoctod in 1920) is a basic factor in the understanding botwoon tho Lobanoso and Syrian Nationalists 7 so-callod compromiso of 1943* Tho areas concornod are hov/ovor culturally and economically backward as compared with other areas in tho Lebanon and havo not yet boon fully assimilated# Tho Moslem hinterland oxerts a considerable power of attraction which would probably be increased if Syria became part of a larger'poll tical on ity undor Hashomito control. Hence Lebanese concern at the possibility of greater unity in tho Fertile Crescent area. Tho present regime is well-disposed towards His Majesty^ Government rut only as a result of the assisttanco given by His Majesty s Government to the cause of Lebanese independence but also because of His Majesty^ Governments known sympathy for Arab Nationalism which is contrasted with alleged French Colonialism. This attitude has been consistently maintained in spite of very considerable French economic and cultural influence# French influence derives from the French controlled Bank of Issue, French concessionary companies (railways, port of Beirut, etc.,) the recent Franco- Lebanese monetary agreement, the French university and schools# and finally from the tradition of friendship between Christian elements in the Lebanon and Franco# The administration is in general of a low standard# tho Civil Service is badly paid and with few notable exceptions is ineffective and dishonest. Political' interference in the administration is unfortunately rampant# 4 .# General Economic Position . During the mandatory period the Lebanon and Syria formed an economic union. Their economies wore in general complemontary - the Lebanon being a country of services and Syria a producing country. When independence was in tho process of being achieved the economic unity was virtually broken, though by a Convention signed in October, 1943# the Customs Union was maintained. The free circulation ot goods between tho two countries, though provided for in the agreement, in practice became restricted and separate import and export policies were followed. Tho growth of industrialisation in both countries tended to strengthen tho separatist toniencics# At the sanfo time the Syrian Government encouraged Syrian merchants to import the country's requirements direct and not as in tho past through Lebanese commercial houses# The quota system applied to tho distribution of import business between Lebanese and Syrian merchants and (particularly after 1946 when the purchase of sterling was restricted) to tho allocation of hard currencies, was based on the population ratio of tho two countries# These arrangements improved the position of Syrian merchants who J^e °von able to some extent to reverse tho normal roles of v the two^ countries an i to soli imported goods in the Lebanon# The Syrian Government also sought to increase tariffs both as a means of limiting imports and of encouraging their nascent industries. This-4- This resulted in the strengthening of the rabvenionts In the Lebanon in favour of the dissolution of the Customs Union and the reorganisation of Lebanese commerce on the ^ basis of free trade. The very high cost of Syrian wheat was also put forward as a reason for a change - in 1947-48 partly as a result of a poor Syrian harvest and partly owing to attempts by the Syrian Government to sell their crop for foreign currency - the Lebanon was obliged to use its foreign exchange to buy Australian, Canadian and American flour. It is realised however that the Syrian hinterland is the Lebanese merchant f s best market and that this must bo maintained and if possible expanded# There are also political objection from the point of view of both the Lebanese and the Syrian Governments to any loosening of the ties binding the two countries. It is also fn?. o d that in abnorm 4 1 times the Lebanon (which in the 1914-1 o war had literally starved) is a dependant on Syria tor its essential food requirements, particularly cereals, o 1 * P ro ' tracta ^ negotiations agreement was reached in July, 1949, wnoroby Syria undertook to supply the Lebanese needs in cereals and a compromise on tariff policy was reached, (a) Commercial Policy Under the Mandate the Levant States were only permitted to conclude commercial treaties with neighbour countries and non-member states of the League of Nations, Imports from the latter were subject to the maximum tariff (usually 50 %). whereas member states enjoyed, without any obligation as regards reciprocity, the normal tariff (usually 25 %)4 Of the arrangements concluded with neighbouring states the most important were those with Palestine and Transjordan which in general provided for the free exchange of agricultural products and (until 1939 when certain restrictions were imposed) of iocaliy manufactured articles. An agreement with Iraq fixed transit dues at 1/^, in common with other Arab League States the Lebanese imposed a boycott on Zionist goods in 194o, In 1948 the conclusion of commercial treaties with Italy and the Yemen and the commercial provisions of the financial agreement with Franco marked a new' departure which is in accordance with the new sovereign status of the Lebanon, W Monetary Position n-nv^a°+ e the Joint Syrian-Lebanese currency was P , re ?? h in 1941 Lebcnoa r.n -1 Syria altered into special relations with the sterling area anri in n qMi the Lebanese - Syrian £ was fixed at 8.85 to £1 The nn+e issue is backed by franc holdings; and the Lebanon anS Syrit. have entered into agreements with Prance wherebv French^^n? v?^ g ^ TOntecd '^.inst de^luahon of the r nen franc vis-a-vis the pound sterling, AffpY» iqrx -Hi ^ French government will gradually release thesYfranc holding for the purchase of goods in France and elsewhere in and Syria did not devalue their currencies fen&lt;-.w?n* the devaluati n of the pound sterling L s^ptemblr S (A^ore detailed statement of the pofition is given in^nnex / (c)-5- (c) Balanco of T rade Owing to the customs union with Syria and the maintenance o£ joint statistics it is extremely difficult to consider the trade of the Lebanon separately from that of Syria; but the iollowing points emerge. Before the war the customs union usually had an adverse balance of trade, but this was largely invisible exports. During the war, allied military expenditure, etc. caused the accumulation of considerable balances of foreign exchange, but these have largely been dissipated, and a serious adverse balance is now faced. This problem is being tackled by the Lebanese government by the encouragement of exports. To some extent overstocking by merchants is automatically reducing imports. A more detailed statement of the position is in Annex XV. (3-) Budget ary Position . The State budget has increased ten-fold since 1949. Receipts have regularly shown a surnlus over exioenditure until 1943-9 when military oxpaaditure and refugee relief necessitated additional appropriations in addition to exhausting the reserve fund. Indirect taxation provides 85$ of the revenue. In 1946 Estimates less than £L 15M was allocated to productive expenditure out of the total of £L 58 - public works £L 11 0 4 education £L 1M, public health £L 2M agriculture £L. 6 m. The balance amounting to £L 43 M is divided to cover salaries and various administrative expenses. ott Ta ? a 'k lon relatively high - it is estimated as £11 sterling per head of the population as coir©ared with £7 sterling in Palestine under the Mandate and £4 sterling in Egypt and oyria - and owing to the fact that 85 $ of the revenue is produced by indirect taxation there is no doubt that the burden is inquitably distributed. Income tax was introduced in December, 1945 but owing to the inefficiency of the revenue authorities and their inability to verify declarations receipts have been small. Reform of the law including a 1 owe ring of the exemption rate and increased rates for higuer income groups seems necessary. Vested interests have so far succeeded in thwarting attempts to effect any change or to introduce a system of death duties and a reform of land taxation. The fall in customs receipts as a result of the decline of imports may in time make these desirable changes inevitable. There seems little doubt that the country will shortly be faced with budgetary difficulties, even if extraordinary expenditure on the armed Forces and on the relief of Palestine refugees is eliminated. A vast pool of capital exists in the hands of Lebanese emigrants abroad. It is hoped that the Lebanese Government will find ways and means of drawing on this capital for • investment or development schemes in the country. 5. Survey In 1947 Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners were engaged by the Lebanese Government to survey the economic resources / of- 6 - of the Lebanon and in February 1948 the Report was submitted* More specialised surveys have been carried out by advisers to the British Middle East Office and include health, labour| and social affairs, agriculture, forestry and soil conservation and statistics. The Statistical Adviser has been invited by the Government to advise on the creation of a central statistical bureau. In 1947, an English export was engaged to make a survey of the possibilities of social insurance# Economic possibilities have also been examined by an International Bank mission in 1948 (see paragraph 26 (c) below). The Socidt4 Libanaise d’Economie Politique has also been engaged over a number of years in the study of economic resources of the country. The results were published early in 1948 and a remarkable book entitled Plan de^Reconstruction d T Economie Libanaise et de Reforme d 1 Etat « On the basis of these reports the Lebanese Government is in the fortunate position of being able to elaborate a balanced programme on economic and social development# 6* Area The total estimated area of the Lebanon is 2,600.000 acres, % of this area is mountainous# Cultivated Uncultivated Forest Suitable for afforestation Rocky &amp; waste 575.000 acres 75,000 acres 185.000 acres 22.1^o of total area# 2*9$ of total area. 7.1$ of total area* 640,000 acres 1 , 125,000 acres 24 * 6 $ of total area# 43*3$ of total area# 2 , 600,000 acres 100 .$ of total area# 7 .

Some estimates have put the total * as high as 450,000 acres, but the greater proportion of this will have to be provided by terracing the mountain slopes which is a slow and costly process, and which can only be justified for the planting of nev/ olive groves or where water is available for the cultivation of fruit trees. It is concluded in the Gibb Report that the Lebanon must • devote her energies to intensification of cultivation of those arable lands already ploughed rather than attempt to bring new lands into use. The most effective manner of doing so is by increasing the area under irrigation. 8 . Irrigation The Lebanese main natural resource is water. The country enjoys a fair annual rainfall over most areas. Though the greater part of this falls during the winter period lasting about seven months and there is considerable variation from year-to-year, many of the rivers and streams have a fair flow of water even at the end of tne long rainless summer. When the rain ceases the rivers are fed by melting snows. There are also believed to be considerable source® of sub-soil water. The need for the maximum exploitation of the country*s water resources for irrigation, domestic use and hydro-electric development is obvious, oertain projects already in hand, a drainage scheme in the South Beqaa^ Valley and irrigation schemes at Lake Yamouneh, and the Akkar Plain and at Qasimiyeh near Tyre. The total area commanded by these schemes is about 90,000 acres and it is estimated that a further 100,000 acres could be irrigated if all possible water supplies were used. The competing claims of irrigation, domestic water supplies and hydro-electric ix&gt;wer need careful balaancing. Some of the schemes already begun were unfortunately launched without sufficient technical investigations. 9. Cadastral Survey By the end of 1946 only 35^ of the Lebanon had been covered by Cadastral Survey. Without such a survey many improvements in farming methods, afforestation and irrigation will be difficult.- 8 - 10, Land Tenure In general large land-owners are for the most part to be found in the coastal plain and in the Beqaa Valley while most of the land in the mountains is held by peasant proprietors. The tenant holdings in the plains are generally large enough to be worked economically but the same is not true of the peasant holdings in the mountains, although income derived from the tourist trade serves to improve the lot of many vollages in favourably placed area. The small holder usually has neither the means to improve his land, for example through the use of fertilisers, nor the capital to purchase the equipment and many are in the hands of money lenders. On the whole however the familiar evils of Middle Eastern land tenure systems appear to be less in evidence in the Lebanon than elsewhere, XX 0 Farming:. Canltal and Go-operatives An Agricultural Oo-operative Society has been in existence for a number of years in the village of Abadiyah, Apart from providing credit for its members the society offers other facilities such as the marketing of produce, the provision of fertilisers and agricultural equipment and instruction as to their proper use. This experiment has undoubtedly proved the value of co-operative effort and the merits of Governmental encouragement, Qrpps, t The climatic conditions of the Lebanon permit the cultivation of a very large range of crops from the tropical banana and sub-tropical olive, citrus and fig to the grape, apple and pear of the temperate zone and the v/heat and potato of the colder area. Annual average production of the country* s main crops is given in Annex V, / The( -9- The Lebanon’s annual requirements in cereals are about 210,000 tons and as indicated above some 90,000 tons are grown locally. It is clear that it would be uneconomical to grow cereals on costly irrigated land and the country cannot h*pe become self-supporting in cereals. The storage of reserves therefore necessary and the construction of silos has been recommended. to is The future of Lebanese agriculture lies in the adoption Of more intensive forms of cultivation (especially by the expansion of irrigation), the introduction of new and more valuable crops and the improvement of existing varieties. Before the war Palestine and Prance were the principle markets for the Lebanese produce. Loss of the Palestine market as a result of the Arab boycott and the Palestine war and the decline m experts to Prance (particularly before the conclusion of the Pranco-Lebonese financial agreement in 1948 ) have proved to be a heavy blow to Lebanese economy. Rowing has developed very considerably in recent yearo and much experience has been gained in the selection of the varieties best suited to local conditions. Nevertheless are ^n r n Pr a P a rt 1 ZS stl11 cf a P 00r quality. Improvements £ eeded m the grading, packing and handling. Fresh rennL^nt/ 1 in Middle East countries where the requirements of foreign oil companies are* increasing and there is also scope for an extension of the present small scale canning industry. Ihe citrus crop estimated at 1 , 000,000 cases a year (as compared with 20,000,000 in Palestine) is of considerable importance but it is doubtful whether the area given over to citrus should be expanded in view of competition from Palestine and the demands of other crops such as bananas and vegetables which present a greater possibility of export. jP 16 cul ’t ;iva ' fcion of olives is important as quasi arid hillsides can be used and as this type of cultivation contri- outes to soil conservation, 13* Live Stock An estimate of the live stock position is given in Annex VI. a Except for goats (which number about half a million) Th 1 R q ?= nt k y -&gt; 0 : h liV f S n t0Ck iS low ’ The &lt;3 ual i*y is also poor. I ? a i nl y aues to lack of paetcrage and any Increase is * ° R ^ he 1Q5 s38ifica«ion of agriculture. In general roand * m y nc ' ;ement in quality and performance of the Sh ?f d b ® a i me&lt; ? at rather than any great increase in numbers. It xs in fac-c desirable that in the interests of =h re ? R regeneration and soil conservation the goat population should be decreased. The fall in milk production should be compensated by an improvement in the milk yield of the cows or rh® r '^ ti T ely b y, the keeping of tethered goats in place of the free ranging goats which cause so much damage. 3-4• Fores ts and Soil 0 onserva tion Misuse through uncontrolled felling, charcoal burning and brousing of goats has sadly deplea ted the once famous /forests10 - 4 ' forests of the Lebanon. The present estimated area for forests is about 185,000 acres which could be increased to 750,000 acres. The bare hillsides are a danger to agriculture. More forests would be an asset in connexion with the tourist trade and over a long period the reafforestation might produce most of the country’s timber needs and provide a surplus for export. The control of goats is essential. The problem is similar to that which existed in Cyprus before effective measures of forest preservation were introduced, and in 1948 the Director of forests in the Lebanon visited Cyprus in the company of the Forestry and •OH*C°nservation Adviser to the Middle East Office. The latter hag recommended the restriction of goats and sheep, the establish ment of small administrative areas for soil conservation, the training of staff in the United Kingdom and Cyprus and the separation of the Forestry Service from the Department of Agriculture. Responsible Lebanese are aware of the importance of restoring their forests and there are hopes that progress may be made in the near future. 15* Mine rals Geological investigations to date have shows that the Lebanon possesses no metallic mineral wealth except limited quantities of sulphate of lead in the Mount Hermon area. Non- metallic minerals are limited to deposits of inferior lignite, which exist in virtually inaccessible places, a small deposit #f asphalt and silica sand. The last is valuable as it is used in local glass factories and in the past was exported to Palestine. There is no lack of good quality building stone. Test borings for oil have up to date been unsuccessful apd it seems doubtful whether any deposits exist. 16. Fishe ries Although the Lebanon and Syria have some 140 miles of eea board with suitable anchorages for fishing boats the amount of fish landed is only between four and five hundred tons. That this can probably be increased is indicated by the relative figures for Palestine which were normally about 2,000 tons a year. Whether a large scale fishing industry can be developed is doubt ful since the Eastern Mediterranean, except for the stretch off the mouth of the Nile does not appear to contain very large quantities of fish. During tfte war attempts were made to stock inland waters but they do not appear to have been maintained. Trout in the Orontes River may prove an increasing attraction to tourists and their preservation should be encouraged. 1?• Industry Though the economy of the Lebanon is likely to remain, at least for many years, predominantly agricultural, it needs the support and stimulus provided by the development of industry. This is also necessary to absorb some of the increase in the population which agriculture alone even when fully developed will be unable to provide for. Existing industries apart from oil refining and transiting at Tripoli are cotton spinning and weaving^ silk spinning, silk and rayon weaving, wool weaving and knitting, cement, tanning. /olive oil-11- olive oil pressing and refining, soap, jams, preserves, chocolate, alcohols, biscuits and matches. (Details may be found in Annex VII.) 18 . Power Hydro-electric power is undoubtedly an important field of development in the Lebanon. The British Good-will Mission of 1946 was much impressed by its possibilities and Metropolitan Vickers, one of whose senior staff was a member of the Mission, have considered it worth while to appoint an engineer to reside at Beirut to watch developments. Increased power would be available for industry, the development of rural and tourist amenities, pumping -for irrigation and possibly for use by the oil companies. Control tx certain rivers would help contribute to soil conservation and the development of hydro-electric power. Due regard should, however, be paid to the requirements of agriculture and domestic water supply. P res e n t position of electric supply is that about half of the population is served. Prices are high, 17,852 kws. are generated by water power a^d 9 f ?00 kws. by thermal stations. These figures present the installed capacity: firm capacity is approximately 5,000 and 8,500 kws. respectively. Recommendations in the Gibb survey include:— (a) In view of the unsatisfactory manner in which private concessions for the development of hydro-electric power have been operated in the past a Public Utility Corporation to maximum co-ordination utilisation of water resources S vJ 0U ^ s , et up or fail:i - n g that a Water Resources Board should be formed to control and co-ordinate the activities of concessionary companies. (b) Due regard should be paid to the demands of irri gation and domestic water supply. demand for electricity by 1956 is estimated at 53,000 kws, (excluding any requirements of the oil companies). This calls for a generating capacity of between 40 and 50 thousand kws. of firm power. (d) On a short term basis the 16,250 kws. should be developed hydro-electrically and 10 to 15 thousand kws. by thermal means. (e) A further study of water resources should be made at once • (f) A Snort Term Plan should include the development of the following:- Barid River, 7,000 kws. Ibrahim River (No, 3 station) 3,000 kws. (this scheme has now been cpmple .:ed but the high tension cable has not been installed). yet Ibrahim River (number 2 station) 12,750 kws. Thermal stations 15,000 kws. /All stations-12- m f All stations on the litoral should be linked by a high tension cable* The estimated cost of the Short Term Plan is, (i) £L 25 - 35 M for hydro-electric power, (ii) £LU - 6 M for thermal stations. (g) A Long Term Plan should include hydro-electric development on the Litani River which is expected to develop 15,000 kws. This plan should also provide for a National Grid. No reliable estimate of the cost of the Litani scheme is available but the figure of £ 10 , 000,000 sterling has been mentioned. Two attempts have been made to interest British capital in the development of hydro-electric power* The first was made by the company involved in the development of the Ibrahim River scheme* The British group has owing to certain anomalies in the administration of the company been unfortuna tely obliged to'retire, at least temporarily. The second was by a Mr. Maasry who is seeking (and has virtually been promised) a concession for the development of five rivers including the Litani River,. French interests and in particular those involved in the Banque de Syrie et du Liban are also studying a hydro-electric development especially on the Litani River where French engineers are at present engaged in survey work. They are at present hostile to the ,: Maasry scheme ,, * It is believed that attempts had been made by French financiers to interest the International Bank in the Litani development, and there are indications that the sponsors might be disposed to use Jewish capital, in which case a proportion of the power developed might be exported to Israel* It is noteworthy that under the Hays plan it is proposed to construct a dam and power station •n the upper waters of the Hasbani River, i.e. within Lebanese territory. There is however an alternative Lebanese plan for the diversion of the waters of ffiasbani into the Litani if irrigation of the Beqaa Valley results in reducing the flow in the lower reaches of the Litani. 19. Tourist T rade. There is no doubt that the tourist trade could be developed. Its development depends partly on circumstances which are within the power of the Lebanese Government to control, e.g. better organisation, improvement of accommo dation and amenities, better publicity, special tourist rates etc., and partly on circumstances outside their control, for example exchange difficulties and high prices. The Govern ment have already employed a Swiss expert to advise on develop ment. Before the war a thriving tourist trade was built up but this has declined for a variety of reasons; high cost of living, exchange difficulties and improved communications with Europe from the Middle Eas'c countries which provided the bulk Of pre-war tourists. Tourists were mainly summer visitors but there are also considerable possibilities for winter sports. /The number-13- The number of summer visitors reached 18,800 in 193^&gt; v/hom some 5,000 were Palestinians, 8,000 Egyptians, and 3,500 Iraqi. It has been estimated that the annual income derived from tourism amounted to £L 33 ,OC0,000. The number of summer visiters in 1946 to 1947 is approximately 13,000 for each year* T It is widely believed that the 1938 figures ctuld be trebled. 20 . Q ornme rce . Though the Lebanon is principally agricultural its prosperity is undoubtedly due in a large measure to its commerce. The develop ment of the port of Beirut and of its communications with the interior during the nineteenth and early part the twentieth century was a decisive factor and with the exception of the port Of Haifa (developed during the mandatory period) Beirut is the only port on the Levant coast capable of handling trade in an efficient manner and on an adequate scale throughout the year. It should be noted that Syria is probably the most important jnarket for Beirut f s commercial activities. Transit trade is not very great - trade with Iraq and Jordan is handicapped by poor crramunications. Improved communications and a greater economic unity in the Fertile Crescent area might greatly increase the Lebanf.se commercial activities particularly if the boycott of Israel and of' tne port of Haifa is maintained. During the past two years much of the goods imported into the Jordan has in fact passed through the port of Beirut. There is no doubt that a great deal of business is done in Beirut without the merchandise ever passing through the Lebanon - Lebanese business houses have contacts throughout the Middle East and in many other parts of the world. The importance of Beirut as a financial centre has undoubtedly increased. Before the war the Lebanon’s principle supplier was France. In 1945-6-7 the first place was taken by the United States of America. The United Kingdom has maintained its position as the second most important supplier until 1948 when it took the lead from the U.S.A. Imports are dominated by manufactured articles and food, while raw materials are relatively insignificant. Before the war Palestine and France were the two main markets for Lebanese and Syrian products. Since 1945 the volume of exports to these two countries fell considerably. 21. Communications. (a) Roads. The existing system is sufficient for the general economic needs of the country. In fact recent annual expenditure 0 n the roads is probably, greater than can be justified. A part of the roads budget could with advantage be allocated to more produc tive development such as irrigation. (b) Railways. There are two lines, Beirut-Damascus (narrow gauge, 147 kilometres), Ras Naqura-Beirut-Tripoli (standard guage 192 kilometres). Railways of the Lebanon (and of Syria) are Operated by a Frencn concessionary company, the D.H.P. There ax'e few years when they are operated without loss, which the Government according to the terms of the concessions has to meet. This deficit has been due in great part to growing competition to motor trans port which has been indirectly subsidised by the Government's extravagant road building policy. With the exception of the extension of the broad gauge line of the Beirut area railway development is unnecessary but the reorganisation of the present /system, including-*114“ system, including the study of the possibility of the elimination (by the construction of a tunnel) of the rack and the introduction of the standard gauge on the Beirut-Damascus line, seems necessary, (c) Ports . The two main ports are Beirut and Tripoli. The former has an annual handling capacity of 500,000 tons of foreign trade and 100,000 tons of local trade. The turn-round of ships is however slow owing to poor administration particularly in the customs. Certain minor improvements under consideration t« reduce wave-action inside the harbour are estimated to cost between £L 6 to 8 million. Further schemes to expand the port by a third basin at the estimated cost of £L 25,000,000 (Stage l) and £L45,000,000 (Stage 2) are likely to be necessary in the near future. Tripoli is little more than an open roadstand which would be difficult and costly to improve. The average annual tannage handled in the eight pre-war years was about 160,000 tons of which 3°^ w&amp; s represented by exports. Foreign tonnage handled in 1945 and 1946 was 315,000 and 218,000 tons respectively. Seme development of the port may however take place as a result of the extension of the oil ter minal and refinery. Chekka, Saida and Tyre are suitable only for coastal craft and owing to competition from road transport, their traffic is decreasing. The development of the Syrian port of Lattaqieh might have a considerable effect on the activity of Lebanese ports. (d) Civil Aviation. Internal Air Lines are not necessary in view of the small size of the country and the excellence of its road system. The two Lebanese Civil Aviation Companies, the Middle East Air Lines and La Compagnie Generale des Transports are handicapped by inefficient administration and lack of funds and have as a result been only moderately successful. Their traffic is mostly with neighbouring countries. A number of landing grounds were built during the war but are not now in use. The three existing airfields are Beirut, Tripoli and Rayak. Beirut airport is used by several foreign air lines. The runways are however too short (four engined planes are unable to use them) and owing to its proximity to the town the approach is difficult. A new and larger airfield is now being constructed at Khalde three miles south of Beirut at an estimate of £3,000,000 sterling. The present aerodrome will be used as a building site. Whether Khalde will become an airport of international importance depends largely on competition from Libya. It was planned by British and American engineers and the Lebanese Government are alive to the importance of efficient manage ment and control. Though tperation will probably be a permanent charge on the Company’s budget, the airport should prove a valuable asset to the country. Improved air communications are clearly essential for a development of the tourist industry which depends on visitors not only from the Middle East countries but also from further afield particularly Lebanese emigrants from the Americas. (e) Telephones . The installation of an automatic exchange at Beirut has been planned and tenders for the contract have been invited. Telephone communication between Beirut and the provinces and also external lines are also in need of improvement. 22. Health. By Middle East standards the Lebanon is a /healthy- 15 - healthy country. There is however a considerable amount of malaria, particularly in the Beqaa Valley, f A sufficient number of doctors is turned out by the American and French universities at Beirut, In fact there is an '’export ’ 1 of doctors to other Middle East countries. The doctor's fees are nevertheless extremely high and this inevitably causes a great hardship. A scheme of Social Insurance is at present being worked out by the Government and improved States medical services, e,g, hospitals in provincial capitals are gradually being provided by the Ministry of Public Health, The hos^dtals of the American and French universities and also x the Lebanon hospital for Mental Diseases (an international institution having its main committee in London) attract patients from many parts of the Middle East. 23* Education and Technical Training . There is probably a higher rate of literacy in Lebanon than in any other Middle East country. The focus of higher education is to be found in the American and French universities which in addition to providing general education also train doctors and engineers. A considerable number of Lebanese, particularly the wealthier classes, are educated abroad. There is a state technical school which trains some 250 pupils. The standard is reasonably good and instruction is given in foundry work, precision engineering, textiles and motor engineering. There are also smaller technical schools in Tripoli, Baida and Zahle, British education (apart from the British Council) is however represented only by a few small missionary schools. Though the training they provide is good, the schools are far from meeting the increasing demands for education on British lines. The need for a British secondary school and improved technical training (particularly in connexion with the oil industry) has long been felt and the problem is now receiving attention from the British Council. It is noteworthy that the ’’diaspora” of Palestinian Arabs has served to increase the desire for British education and British methods, 24. Labour . Workers' interests are protected by comprehensive labour law introduced in 1946, It covered such questions as hours of work, minimum wages, leaving indemnities, family allowances, workmen's compensation, employment of women and juveniles, trade unions, etc. Present labour difficulties arise from the increase in the number of industrial workers, the very high cost of living, and the unemployment and under employment which followed the withdrawal of the allied forces after the war. The Gov rnment is aware of the urgency of the problem. A Social Security Plan has been prepared by a British expert. The scheme is based on tripartite contributions (by the workers, employers and the State), and is planned to be executed in three stages. Stage 1....- 16 - Stage 1 covers old age pensions,family allowances, /# employment injuries, sickness and invalidity benefit, and maternity benefit. Stage 2 covers unemployment benefit. Stage 3 covers benefit for widows and other dependents. Three distinctive factions exist in the Trade Union movement - a Communist controlled group of syndicates led by Mustafa el Ariss and two anti-Communist groups which enjoy Government support in varying degree. Needs in the immediate future include, (a) Continued close co-operation between the Gov rnment and British Middle East experts, in particular the Labour expert. (b) The expansion of technical training facilities. (c) Visits to the United Kingdom of representatives of the anti-Communist Trade Unions. (d) The training of Government officials dealing with social and labour affairs, for example at the Ministry of Labour in the United Kingdom. 25. Foreign Experts. No British experts are at present employed on a permanent basis under the Lebanese Government. There are similarly no French or American- permanent experts (though a Frenchman is employed in a minor position at the airport). There is a marked tendency to recruit experts from the nationals of the smaller states. A Belgian is at present employed to advise on Customs problems and a Swiss has been engaged to draw up plans in connexion with the development of the tourist trade# British consultants have however been engaged from time to time to advise on specific problems. Reference has already been made to the employment of the firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners for the economic survey and in 1947 Professor Robson of London University was appointed to report on social insurance in the Lebanon. The services of B.M.E.O# experts have also been made use of though r owing to other calls on their time they have not been able to meet all the requirements of the Lebanese Government, for example in connexion with the creation of a Central Statistical Bureau. In 1948 the Government invited Monsieur Van Zeeland the Belgian economist and statesman to advise them on problems arising from the Fronco-Lebanese Financial Agreement and the Customs Union with Syria. 26. Development Plans . (a) The Gibb Report . Owing to the mountainous nature of the country the Gibb Report emphasises that agricultural development must take the form of, (l) a more intensive cultivation (involving in particular the expansion of irrigation), ( 2 ) cultivation....- 17 - ( 2 ) cultivation of more valuable crops, (fruit and vegetables at the ^rpense of cereals). Reconstruction of grain silos is recommended. The need for improved rural education, marketing and distribution, agricultural co- operatives, research and experimental stations, greater use of iertilisers, the introduction of modern methods and equipment end the control of pests and diseases is empHasised. ^ Development of industry is necessary to provide stimulus tor agriculture, to ensure a market for agricultural products and to give employment to labour not absorbed in agriculture. Greater tariff protection and official encouragement are necessary, m addition to improved methods and better publicity for locally manufactured articles. The encouragement which industry would derive from the availability of cheap power is emphasised. Both in the interests of agriculture and industry the full use of the water resources of the country is recommended. The importance of the administrative organisation to be entrusted with this development is stressed. It is pointed out that private concessionary companies do not provide the best aporoach (particularly in view of the danger that irrigation might be sacrificed to hydro electric _ power) , and the establishment of a Public Utility Corporation to develop water resources is recommended. Palling that a Water Resources Board should be set up to co-ordinate and control the activities of concession: ry companies. Annex VIII tabulates the works of a capital nature which i51r Alexander Gibb and Partners believe are desirable for the economic progress of the country. W Socidtd Libanaiso a f Beanomie Politique Annex IX tabulates the overall programme of development recommended by the Socidtd. The total expenditure involved \&amp; estimated at £ Lebanese 570 millions, of which it is estimated that £Lebanese 218 millions will be required for external expenditure* The Socidtd estimate that £L135*000,000 could be provided by private investors leaving £L400,000,000 to be invested by the State (£L200,000 ,000 by a State loan and the balance by annual allocations in the State budget). ( c ) International Bank . In 1948 the Lebanese Government ? P cr;i ea to the Interna ^ional Bank for a loan of 18 f 600,000 dollars 7 * 500,000 dollars were for non-capital goods and 6 , 000,000 dollars for expenditure in local currency, neither of which the Bank can consider. ^ The remaining 5*000,000 dollars was intended to cover eleven projects, including two small hydro-electric schemes, some irrigation schemes, the construction of grain silos, and the ■purchase of agricultural machinery. The Bank Mission was undoubtedly somewhat perplexed by the enigma presented by the Lebanese economy and entertained some doubts as to the economic and political soundness of the country. It appeared at first as if the Bank had decided to refuse the loan* It is known, however, that they would like, if possible, to make a small loan for some specific projects as a pilot scheme before embarking on more extensive programmes in other Middle East countries. In April, 1949* the economist of the Mission was sent to Beirut to make further enquiries and it now seems possible that a small loan may be given. 27. Recommendations. Owing to the special position and influence of the Lebanon in the Middle East, it is recommended that:— (l) That His Majesty’s/-18- * (1) That His Majesty's Govc 3 rnm nt should encourage the Lebanese Government to give a high priority to economic and social development and to set up a Development Board to study the recommendations of the Gibb Report* The Lebanese Government should in particular be encouraged to put into execution as soon as possible (subject to any further investigation which may be necessary) the projects listed in Annex I of the present paper and to undertake without delay the survey of the further projects listed in Annex II, (2) That while France has important cultural and economic interests in the Lebanon which should be recognised and the French Government have indicated that French financial and commercial interests should participate in the economic development of the country, His Majesty’s Government should also as far as the other calls on the resources of the United Kingdom available for overseas investaents permit, give financial, material and technical assistance for the execution of the development programme. In particular British firms already showing interest in development projects in the Lebanon should be subject to balance of payment considerations, be given all possible encouragement. British interests in the Basque du Syrie et du Liban should also be encouraged to use their influence to ensure the early development of the country's economic resources and to facilitate British participation in the programme, (3) In view of the importance of commerce to the Lebanon His Majesty's Government should assist the Lebanese Government in strengthening the country's position as a commercial and financial centre, and be prepared to advise the Lebanese Government on the establishment of a sound basis for its currency, if they should request our assistance, (4) His Majesty's Government should, subject to price considerations, encourage the import to the United Kingdom of Lebanese products, for example citrus fruit. (3) His Majesty's Government should continue to urge and assist the British Council to establish a British secondary school and a British technical college in the Lebanon. ( 6 ) It should be recognised that the possibilities of resettlement of Palestine refugees in the Lebanon are limited. The full development of the economic resources of the Lebanon (and of its hinterland, Syria) might result in employment being available for a small number of urban Palestinians.AMEX III Moaetary Position&gt; The joint Lebanese-Syrian currency, issued by the Manque du Syrie et du Liban in virtue of a convention signed in 1924 and renewed in 1937* is entirely covered by French francs, French Government securities and (to a very limited extent) by gold# Following the expulsion of Vichy forces in 1941 the T.obnnr. and Syria entered into special relations with the sterling area. Sterling necessary for essential requirements was provided. From May, 1943 the purchase of sterling was free and many Lebanese acquired large holdings. Restrictions on the purchase of sterling were reimposed in March, 1946 and essential requirements were made available by the French Treasury. As a result of the Anglo-French-Lebanese-Syrian financial agreement of 1944 which fixed the Lebanese-Syrian pound at 8.85 to J31, the French authorities undertook to revalue, in the event of a devaluation of the franc in terms of sterling, the Lebanese and Syrian franc holdings. When devaluation took place in December, 1945 this engagement was honoured by the payment by the French Treasury of 16.6 milliard francs. A year later however the Fanner Government indicated that in the event of a further devaluation of the franc they would not be prepared to make good the depreciation of Lebanese and Syrian holdings. Appeals by the Lebanese and Syrian Governments to His Majesty’s Government and to the United States Government produced no results and negotiations were opened with France. The French Government after protracted talks agreed to revalue (following the revaluation of the franc in January, 1948), and to guarantee against further devaluation some sixteen milliard out of the total of approximately 23 milliard francs held by Lebanon and Syria /afterafter deducting the cost of certain French properties in the Lebanon and Syria taken over by the local Governments; to release these holdings at a rate not exceeding one tenth per year during the five year period beginning January, 1953* and at the n end of that period to make available the balance in any currency desired by the Governments (or if exchange restrictions existed at the time), half in French francs and half in European currencies. They however agreed to release the balance of the 23 milliard francs partly in francs for the purchase of French goods and partly (but not exceeding one half) in European currencies, i.e. not including dollars. The Lebanese Government signed an agreement on this basis in January, 1948• The Syrian Government declined and it was not until the summer of 1949 that a Franco-Syrian agreement was concluded. Though the signatures of the Franco-Lebanese agreement was the subject of great controversy ip the Lebanon there is little doubt that the disadvantages of the agreement are more than outweighed by its advantages® Monetary stability (except in the event of a devaluation of sterling) is guaranteed fdr ten years. It should be observed however that, before the end of that period when the franc cover may be only half of the value of Lebanese and Syrian pounds in circulation, the currency will probably need to be reorganised® It is generally recognised in the Lebanon that it should be brought more into line with currencies of neighbouring countries than based on sterling. Syria and the Lebanon did not devalue their currencies following the devaluation of the pound sterling in September, 1949» The note circulation of the Lebanon and Syria which in 1939 amounted to some £SL l\Ohl increased in 1945 as a result of allied military expenditure to about £LS 490M. It fell in 1947 to £LS 346M and the bank of issue by restricting credit is now following a policy of disinflation. The value of bank notes in circulation in the Lebanon fell from £L172 in May 1949 to £Ll64 in August. In 1947* 159,000,000 were pounds Lebanese, (i.e. issued in Beirut) # / and^ana 187^00,000 were pounds Syrian (issued in Damasgus), This division is however arbitrary - in February, 1948 was £ound that some 60,000,000 Syrian pounds were in the Lebanon# Gold is still used to a great extent as a medium of transaction in Syria* Jt is noteworthy that the Ottoman Bank has an important interest (it holds 11,000 out of the total of 51 &gt;CXX) shares) in the Banque de Syrie et du Liban and that British financial interests are thus involved in the bank of issue* A British of^Tittinl was appointed to the staff of the Bank* s Head Office in Beivut some three years ago but he has not been permitted to influence to any great extent the policy of the bank ufoich is firmly in the hands of French officials.ANNEX IV Balance of Trade m Owing to the Customs Union with Syria and the maintenance ( of joint statistics it is extremely difficult to consider the trade of the Lebanon separately from that of Syria* An adverse balance of trade v/as a feature of the economy of the Customs Union even before the war but the deficit was made good by invisible exports (expenditure by the French military authorities^ emigrants remittances, tourist trade, commercial and other services). During the war expenditure by the allied armies combined with obstacles to trade resulted in the accumulation of very considerable balances of foreign exchange. Since the war the adverse balances of trade became more serious and increased from about £L 90M in 1945, to £L 186M in 1946# The volume of exports particularly to Palestine and France fell and imports reached the pre-war level* In view of the depletion of stocks as a result of the war, the latter is not surprising or even excessive* The value of .Imports was nearly four times that of pre*-war years but this is due not only to increased prices but also to the high proportion of luxury goods and gold coin and bullion* It is estimated that as much as 60% of the gold so imported is re exported clandestinely. The reserve accumulated during the war was thus considerably reduced though a balance probably still remains and the gold holdings in the country which have probably been increased represent a reserve of purchasing power. It was feared that if the capital reserves were not to be exhausted and the country left without the means to purchase essential requirements imports might have to be restricted. Valuable assets had indeed been frittered away on unessentials. Expenditure by the military authorities which in pre-war years had served to bridge the gap ceased when the countries /achievedachieved independence and alternative sources of income ^remained to be proved. There were however many obstacles in the way of official control and limitation of imports# As the Lebanon is a country of services (commercial, tourist, educational, etc.,) a policy of austerity was not easy to Justify and there exist the practical difficulties inherent in an inefficient administration. Present indications are that as a result of the change from a sellers to a buyers market and overstocking by merchants imports are being automatically reduced. In the meantime the Government has made a beginning with the to some extent alternative policy of encouraging exports, e.g. the commercial agreements with Italy, Prance, and the Yemen, The decision in September, 1949 not to devalue the Lebanese and Syrian currencies is however bound to increase the difficulties facing Lebanese exporters. The establishment of an important money market in Beirut has also been encouraged by the legalisation in the .Autumn' of 1948 of the free market in foreign exchange. This latter development was considered undesirable from the point of view of British exchange control as It resulted In an .irregular dollar sterling cross rate but there is little doubt that the operation of the market contributes towards bridging the Lebanese deficit in her balance of payments# According to the Socigtd Llbanaise d^conomie politique the deficit in the Lebanese balance, of payments (as opposed to that of the Lebanese-Syrian Customs Union) amounted in 1946 to about £L 134# 5M half of v/hich was the result of trade with Syrua, and during the war years the deficit amounted to a total of £L 415M. High prices of Syrian agricultural products particularly cereals - in 1946 the Lebanon is estimated to have imported £L 100M worth of goods from Syria, including cereals to the value of £L 50M - were largely responsible. It is emphasised however in the Soci&lt;3t6 f s report that these estimates are necessarily approximate and it is doubtful whether in the /calculations(T sufficient ullownnce is nicid.e fon the very Inrge ^profits made on foreign imported goods re-exported by the Lebanon to Syria during the war and immediately afterwards. Furthermore owing to the abnormally high price of Syrian cereals these figures cannot bo taken as a reliable guide for the future.ANNEX V Annual Average Production of Most Crops in the LeVanon , 92 # 000 tons cereals 15.000 tons leguminous crops (lentils, beans, chick-peas^, eta*) 97.000 tons industrial crops (mainly tobacco) 156.000 tons vegetables (potatoes form the principle item) 80.000 tons grapes 23.000 tons melons 31.000 tons olives .30,500 tons figs 70.000 tons citrus 11,500 tons bananas 40.000 tons deciduous fruits*ANNEX VII * INDUSTRY At the and of tho war thara wore 36,000 spindles in operation in the Lebanon producing about 2,000 tons of yarn as compared with 17,500 spindles in Syria. The total retirements of the Lebanese and Syrian local weaving industry in yarn (including rayon yarn) is about 12,000 tons a year which is over 9,000 tons more than tho output of tho mills in 1946 . axpanaion providing for an additional 10,000 spindles in the Lebanon end 73,COO spindles in Syria should increase tho output of yarn to well over 10,000 tons a year which would not only bo sufficient for local industry, but also to provide a surplus for export. There is in fact considerable danger of over expansion, but the cotton spinning industry clearly merits encouragement especially as it increases tho demand for locally grown cotton. Weaving of cotton textiles is not so important in the Lebanon as it is in Syria. Production is estimated at 1,200 tons in the Lebanon as compared with 7,500 tons in Syria. A modern wool weaving factory equipped to provide almost the entire requirements of tho Lebanon exists near Beirut and the goods it turns out are of high quality. its production in 1946 however was only one fifth of its capacity and it is handicapped by customs duos on imported wool yarn and by tho inexperience of and high rate of pay of its operators which render difficult competition with foreign products. Cement production amounts to about 150,000 tons a year. Lack of power at present prevents full capacity production. The factory situated on the coast is well placed for export - 65,000 tons were shipped in 1937 - and expansion up to a /productive?productive capacity of 300,000 tons a yoar which is in hand appears justified. The tanning and connected industries which greatly expanded during the period between the two wars and was the basis of considerable export trade to neighbouring oountriea, particularly Palestine, has recently lost ground# Though only partly dependent on locally produced raw hides its encouragement is doubly important to the country. Olive oil is produced in considerable quantities. It ia mainly consumed locally as food or in the manufacture of soap but fairly large quantities are also exported. The oil is obtained from innumerable primitive presses scattered throughout the olive producing areas* The need for technical improvement is obvious and the formation of industrid associations has been suggested. Since the war a modern refining plant has been erected by local business' iqqzx who hope to secure British participation in its operation. About a half of the soap produced in Syria and the Lebanon ie of Lebanese manufacture. In the past this soap was renowned in the Middle East but both Syria and the Lebanon now import more soap than they export. The industry stands in need of complete overhaul. The canning and preserving industry is at present on a small scale and is working under considerable difficulties caused to some extent by the high prices of imported tin plate and sugar. The industry deserves to be encouraged both foi 1 its own sake and for the stimulus it would give to agriculture* The freezing of fruit and vegetables would also appear to be a suitable development. Lack of coal and iron makes development of heavy industries impossible. The Lebanon’s raw materials are the product of the land and industry should in general be based on the /transformationtransformation and processing of these products. Possible exceptions are the manufacture of nylon and fertilisers # markets for which are considerable. The former however calls for heavy capital expenditure and for technical skill which is not at present to be found in the country. The manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers - the requirements of the Lebanon and Syria are likely to reach 20,000 tons a year in the near future - calls not only for capital and technical skill but also for power. It has been estimated that 10,000 kws. are required for the production of the 20^000 tons a year. A further possibility is the manufacture of super—phosphates and this development which would involve the import of phosphates fr^m Jordan, is already being studied* Cheap, power which would also encourage foreign manufacturers to sot up assembly plants possibly to cover the whole Middle East is oaiiantial* In the past commerce has been favoured at the expense of industry which not in general received the official support it requires. A beginning has however been made and in May, 1949 restrictions on imports affecting local industries (textiles, leather goods and preserves) were imposed and the Lebanese-Syrian Economic Agreement in 1949 has provided for increase in import duties on cotton and artificial silk yarns and on textiles. It also xjrovided for increases in tariffs to protect local industries and for reductions in tariffs on raw materials required by local industry to be studied*. It should bo noted that although the Lebanon has no known oil resources, the oil industry brings considerable wealth to the country. The Iraq Petroleum Company pipe lino from Kirkuk is partly serviced from Tripoli and the Company not only provides employment for many Lebanese, both at its installations and also at the small Tripoli refinery, but is /alsoalso a source of considerable foreign exchange. The refinery has recently expanded to double its output (sufficient to meet the internal needs of Syria and Lebanon). Similarly, the Trans-Arabian Pipe Line Company when its terminal and refinery are completed at Sidon will provide additional employment and further foreign exchange In accordance with its agreement with the Lebanese Government concluded in 1946, the Company undertook to pay the sum of £ 25,000 (or per ton of oil), whichever may be the greater as a transit payment. Though the agreement with the Iraq Petroleum Company concluded in 1931 makes no such provision, the Company offered in 1947 to make tc the Lebanese Government an annual payment of £45,000. lA roor^ detailed description is given in Annex VII)AHHEX VTTT The following table covers the works of a capital nature which Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners believe are desirable for the economic progress of the country.

V?sp * (T H-U5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS^ BRITAieiO I^AJESTY^ ‘gOVERMENT ) Economic Development (Overseas) from the Chairman of the Middle East (Official) Committee. On the 14th May the Middle East (Official) Committee submitted a paper (M.E. ( 0 ) (49) 14 - also .E.D. (0. S.) (49)7 on economic and social development in the Middle East. 2, The object of this preliminary paper was to point out the vital need for economic development in the Middle East and at the same time to elaborate the general principles which govern such development. 3 9 Since the Paper was submitted, a number of Middle East countries have been studied individually and in detail and Papers containing the results have been prepared in respect of Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Jordan. A similar Paper on the Lebanon is nearing completion.' 4. The urgency of the problem become immediately apparent. In most cases a redistribution of existing wealth would not be enough to remedy the dangerously low standards of the masses. With the work thus far advanced, and particularly as in a number of countries there were indications that a start was likely to be made in the near future with the execution of certain schemes, it was felt that an Interim Report .was called for. The need for proceeding empirically with development impressed itself on the Committee at an early stage and this was considered to be an additional reason for submitting an Interim Paper in preference to awaiting the conpletion of an overal-1 development plan for the whole area. ’ 'w 5» Moreover four of the five countries already studied are those in v/hich economic development offers the best prospect of an early solution of the urgent problem of the Palestinian f refugees. In Syria and Iraq there are vast undeveloped areas the cultivation of which would contribute not only to the economies of the countries concerned but also to the agricultural resources of the Middle East as a whole and even of the world. The Lebanon and Jordan are comparatively small countries and the possibilities of economic development are in comparison limited. The former is, however, in many respects the most advanced of all Arab countries and if fully developed might serve as an example to its less favourably placed neighbours; tht- latter is the Arab country where British influence is most directly felt and where in consequence the prospect of early progress in the economic field is likely to be greatest. The fifth country, Egypt, is important because of the far-reaching Nile Waters 1 Project on. which a beginning has already been made and also because of its serious population problem. 6. The attached paper, together with supporting 'country papers', was considered at the Conference of His Majesty’s Representatives in the Middle East, held in London from 21st July to 28th July. TOP SECRET COPY NO • • • • ••••••• MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE Note to the Chairman of the Official Committee on/13 7# The Conference of His Majesty's Representatives in the Middle East laid particular stress on the following points:- (a) The vital importance of the Middle East to the U*K«' in peace' and war; (d) the fact that side by side with pressure from His 4 Majesty's Government for better administration and for the spread of education to encourage public Spirit, progress in economic and social development must be an essential factor in improving conditions in Middle East countries and combating the growth of communism; (c) unless the U. K. is able and willing to make a considerable contribution to a programme of economic and social development her position in the Middle East, which is vital to her on political, strategic and economic grounds- alike, will be gravely and perhaps fatally jeopardised. 8. Strategically the Middle East is an area of cardinal importance second only to the U.K. itself. It is a focal point of communications, a source of oil, a shield to Africa and the Indian ocean, and an irreplaceable offensive base. 9. In the economic sphere the importance of the Middle East to the U.K. ought not to be underestimated. Without the Middle East our general balance of payments position would be insoluble. Apart from the large profits made on oil, the oil itself is. necessary to the sterling area and i s irreplaceable. In the supply of Middle East oil to other countries for sterling we are earning a useful Income and helping to balance our trade ’with those countries. 10. Egyptian cotton is likewise a vital commodity for the U.K. and is irreplaceable. The long staple cotton we obtain from Egypt is processed into high grade textiles which find a market in the dollar area and to this extent cotton we obtain from Egypt contributes to our dollar earnings. 11. Finally, the Middle East provides a large market for British exports and one that is yearly becoming larger as oil'royalties increase. The denial of the Middle East to 'the U.K. would involve ^ loss in U.K. export trade of about £150 millions per annum. 12. The nature of the U.K.'s contribution to the economic and social development of Middle East countries may be ciiny or all of the following - (1) U. K. pr eduction to meet Middle East requirements for essential development works. (2) (a) Support for applications for loans submitted by Middle East Governments to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. (b) Participation in International Bank loans, i.e. by use of the sterling contribution to the capital of the Bank* (3) Provision of technical assistance. (U) Larger sterling releases to pay for U.K. goods and services or for transfer to other countries for goods and services. ' • . (5) Direct cash loans.13. The kind of assistance required will vary from country to country. In all cases, however, the ultimate requirements will be goods (particularly capital goods) and services. -14* The matter for early decision is in general the extent ' ^ to which U.K. production can and should contribute to the. proposed economic projects in the Middle East. 15* The total external expenditure in sterling required for the projects outlined in Annex A(l) of this paper i s of the order of £80 million (£90 million less £10 million dollar expenditure) some part of v/hich will be for services while the greater part will be for goods. Spread as nearly as we can estimate ovsr a period of X) to 13 years the demand for production sand services would amount to an average of about £8 million per annum. Even assuming that orders are placed in good time and the. execution of the programme is not held up, only a comparatively small portion of this demand is likely to materialise before 1931-52. The peak will probably be reached in the fifth or sixth year from the conmencement of the programme. It may be that this peak period will coincide with a need in the U.K. for a stimulant to maintain full employment in which event the U.K. may have an additional interest in increasing exports to the area. 16. It is appreciated that until the Golonial, Commonwealth and Far East Committees have submitted their reports it may be difficult for the Official Committee on Economic Development (Overseas)to make any firm recommendation regarding the relative claims on U.K. resources available for overseas development. Nevertheless, whatever the strength of other claims may be,that of the vital Middle East area, for the reasons given above, cannot be neglected for long without grave danger to ourselves and it is strongly urged that as and when opportunities for the execution of individual development schemes occur, we should contribute to the urgent requirements of schemes which sire clearly so essential that they would be included in any overall programme. The interest-free loan to Jordan has already enabled a start to be made with projects which will not only contribute to the development of the country but also mark the first stage in the transition from relief to resettlement of Palestine refugees. Similarly the authority given to British financial Interests to negotiate a loan to the Iraqi Government will, if satisfactory arrangements are concluded, enable the railways to proceed with their existing development programme. 17. During the past few years continuous pressure has been exerted on the Middle East Governments to press on with economic and social development. Hte Majesty’s Representatives are agreed that if this pressure were relaxed we might find great difficulty in regaining the impulse lost, and that if having encouraged the Governments we refused appeals for assistance the effect on our position in the Middle East might be serious. Every effort should therefore be made, as an interim measure (pending a decision regarding the relative claims on U.K. resources available for investment overseas) , to meet the calls on our resources which may be made to us in connexion with development schemes of the type referred to. in the preceding paragraph. Tt Ts envisaged that, In considering sneTi calls will- re-quira on. balance, of payments grounds to explore .the. possibilities in the order set out in paragraph 12 above, and it i s appreciated that there may be considerable difficulties under headings (4) and (5) and also18.^ In the view of the Middle East (Official) Committee, decision on these lines is dictated by our vital interests the Middle Eas't and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has, since 1945 &gt; consistently urged the encouragement of a programme of economic and social development in the Middle East. The programme recommended is' also consistent with President Truman’s Fourth Point. It would represent a substantial contribution to its realisation and .onr participation might relieve us of further calls in this connexion in the area. i 19« The attached paper is accordingly submitted for consideration by the Official Committee on Economic Development (Overseas).

(0) (49) 15» 17, 19 and 20 respectively) have since been prepared as a background, and detailed justification of whatever specific recom mendations it might be decided to put forward. A Paper on the Lebanon (M.E.(0)(49)21) will be circulated shortly. These countries (apart from Egypt which is important because of the Nile Waters Projects) were chosen as the most urgent in view of their particular relevance to the resettlement of refugees. Other countrj 7, studies are being prepared: Persia, whose development plansare farther advanced than those of any other Middle East country but are less dependent, at this stage, on external assistance; the Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, where scope for development other than of oil is limited but whose vast earnings from oil raise most difficult problems and interesting possibilities; the former Italian Colonies, where at present the average annual cost to His Majesty's Government in respect of administration expenses and budgetary deficits approaches £li million; Ethiopia, whose development possibilities may be considerable but whose administration is amongst the least progressive in the Middle East; and the Yemen, the most primitive of the Arab States.2 * The object of this Paper ^ The object of this Taper is to summarise the large amount of detailed information now available and to recommend the practical application of the agreed principles in the light of the most urgent actual requirements and of the best estimate it is possible to make of the cost and timing of selected projects. The questions to be decided are, first, what are the best projects to encourage and, secondly, in what ways His Majesty's Government can help. We cannot ourselves make a final selection of projects for exeuction since such a large proportion of the necessary resources are outside our control. But we can decide in our own minds which of the projects seem most likely to repay the further examination in the light of the internal resources of the country concerned, which will be necessary before they can be put up as fully considered schemes for assistance from the International Bank, United States Government, His Majesty's Government or other governments, with a view to putting thorn into early operation. 3* In selecting projects for inclusion in the programme of development referred to below (paragraph h) the Committee has been guided by the following objectives and criteria (not necessarily in order of priority). (a) Objectives (i) To promote those types of economic activity, whether primary or industrial, in which the countries concerned are best fitted to engage, having regard to the balance of their economies and the advantage of external trade; (ii) To raise living standards as rapidly as levels of productivity permit; (iii) To secure the maximum mutual advantage of the United Kingdom and the Middle East, having regard to any assistance, material or technical, which the United Kingdom may be able to provide; (iv) To build up the capital equipment of the Middle East countries so as to provide a firm basis for future development. /(b)/ 5 . Criteria The proposed development should he one that was iiKeiy to be and to remain an economic proposition but unlikely to be carried out without official assistance or impulsion, (It should bo borne in mind that private development of desirable Indus try (for which special assistance will not be necessary) is also possible. Furthermore social development which is essential for balanced progress should also be provided for). (ii) In present circumstances those projects which promise early results are to be preferred, in particular those which assist in providing an early solution to the problem of refugee resettlement. * The Committee does not feel that the resettlement of Arab refugees should be considered as an entirely separate matter, as many schemes which accord with the above objectives and criteria should assist in solving this problem. Indeed, schemes which are economically the soundest are those bost suited to meet it and to furnish a permanent and ultimately self-supporting solution, r ' * ■ independent of further international aid. Description of Annexes AI and II A list of selected projects with a short description of the benefits t o be derived from some of them and with a rough approximation of the cost and of the time required for execution. B. Extracted from (A) a list of the total internal and external expenditure of the five countries concerned. C. A list showing in respect of projects in Annex AI the internal and external expenditure of each ‘country in each year from I 950 -I 955 and c global figure for the remaining years under consideration.5 Attitude of Local Governments Middle East Governments have of recent years tended to show more interest ,in, internal development and have already made some progress, although their ideas on relative priorities are not always in accord with the objectives referred to above. The acceptance by Middle East Governments of the programme out lined above, as it stands, may therefore require in some cases a considerable reorientation of their present views, which tend to favour rather more sophististicated projects. We consider that the programme set out in Annex A represents the most that can reason ably be achieved and digested by the economies of these countries having regard to the limitations of finance, labour and materials, and after taking as full account as we are able of any outside assistance that they can reasonably expect to receive from the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Bank and any other source. Moreover, should it turn out that we have underestimated the available resources, we consider that anything additional should be applied so as to effect the speedier completion of the programme outlined rather than to extend that programme. It is therefore as ■’important’ to discourage u bad” projects as to encourage 'good' ones. This does not mean that we regard the projects listed as exhaustive or that any fresh project which may be put forward and which could be shown to satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 3(b) above should be resisted. It is at the stage when assistance is being offered, either by ourselves or the United States, that the best opportunity presents itself of securing those objectives which we consider to be the most desirable, by attaching reasonable conditions to the grant of such aid. If we do not resolve to tackle this admittedly knotty problem now, the opportunity may well be lost. 6. Total cost It is emphasised that the figures for the cost of the pro jects listed and for the length of time involved are in most /cases$ ‘ ^a*es extremely rough e$timates, since hardly any actual plans yet exist. Subject to these reservations the total estimated cost of the projects set out in the annexes is roughly ‘^'^^50,000,000. Of this about £140,000,000 may be for external expenditure on services and material, including at least ^ 60 , 000,000 (or about £ 15 , 000,000 sterling) in respect of material at present only available in the IJ. S. The' remaining £110,000,000 would be for internal expenditure. The estimated cost of projects included in Annex AI is approximately £160,000,000 (£90,000,000 for external.and £70,000,000 for internal expenditure). 7♦ General Benefits of the projects . The studies undertaken cover in most cases the period 1950-60 and show that there are possibilities for development which if carried out successfully would produce, among other things the following results (a) General strengthening of the economies of the countries concerned. (b) Control of the disastrous river floods in Iraq which cost on an average about £1 million a year and cause large crop losses; and the lowering of flood risk in Egypt. (c) Increased production of food, e.g. in Iraq an annual increase of 40,000 to 50,000 tons of rice, between 700,000 and 800,000 toils of wheat and barley and possibly quantities of oil seeds and ,cotton; in Syria ah increase of up to 200,000 tons of cereals, mostly wheat, and also possibly quantities of oil seeds pulses and coxton; in the Lebanon and Jordan increased quantities of fruit and vegetables; in Egypt the increased produce of between 1 and 1£ million acres of intensively cultivated land and smaller increases from the pump irrigation schemes /inin the basins. (d) A valuable contribution to the solution of the Palestine refugee problem e.g. in Syria and Jordan and possibly, but less probably, in Iraq. fjp' 8. The projects will need to be accompanied by the appropriate and in many cases-far reaching measures of social and fiscal reform to ensure that the resultant increase in the national wealth is not confined to a small class but goes to raise the general standard of living by permitting increased reai wages and improved social services. It must be the task of His Majesty’s Representative and British experts attached to the B.M.E.O. to press for'the necessary action in this field by the governments concerned. Pull regard must also be paid to the need for the development of private enterprise and of suitable industrial (including managerial) skill. Availability of local resources . Many governments will have difficulty in meeting the local expenditure involved, for which the International Bank will normally not lend. To issue additional local currency for this, even if backing i s provided from external loans, is directly inflationary, and it is most desirable that the local purchasing power required for internal expenditure should be obtained by taxation or local borrowing so as to withdraw equivalent local purchasing power from circulation. Only when this is clearly impossible, as in Jordan at present should the alternative of borrowing abroad for local expenditure be considered, e.g. for such pressing purposes as an immediate project for refugee resettlement, and then with due regard for the accompanying disadvantages and dangers of this course. (These may be lessened if the method of transferring the external currency borrowed into the local currency required is by importing consumer goods and selling them locally; but the process is cumbersome and susceptible of abuse, and could /seldom,seldom, if ever, be carried out on the very large scale on which it has been suggested in certain countries). The only possible exceptions are likely to be cases in which, v . g. Jordan, .internal resources are self-evidently incapable of providing the necessary internal credit but nevertheless a development project is of great importance and urgency for refugee resettlement purposes or other urgent purposes that some external assistance must be extended even to the provision of internal finance. 10. Attitude of the U.S, Government and International Bank . We know that the U.S, Government are extremely anxious to take some concrete step to assist in the resettlement of Arab refugees and to make a contribution either under this heading or as part of the Fourth Point programme or as an independent operation to Middle East development generally. It is however, still quite uncertain what funds it will be possible to obtain from Congress and for what particular purposes. Since American policy i s still in so formative a stage on this subject, we have perhaps a good opportunity for influencing it in what we consider the right direction. The International Bank is already showing interest in Egyptian and Iraqi projects. The Bank is also anxious to assist so far as it can with refugee resettlement but the difficulty here is that the Bank is normally precluded by its terms of reference from making loans which do not secure financial return. In certain cases where the Bank is unable to make a normal loan, we should consider the possibility (suggested by the late President of the Bank) of its doing so in return for guarantees by the U.S. Government and/or H.M. Government (see M.E.(0)(49)10 of 26th April)• 11. Direct advantages to the U.K . (a) The completion of the agricultural schemes may add considerably to the available supplies of soft currency cereals and may thus save dollars to the U.K. and the sterling area. /ForFor example, sterling area wheat from Australia which has been imported into the Middle East will tend to become available for other sterling area countries including the U.K. There should also be increased surpluses of Middle East barley for ^ export to the sterling area countries, .such as India and the U.K. (b) Development in the Middle East could provide opportunities lor expansion of British trade. Considerable imports of capital equipment will be required and most of the large contracts for development works will have to be placed overseas. It is clear however that in the face of existing or increasing competition a special effort will have to be made if we are to gain the share of this market which would be desirable. (We should also bear in mind that if contracts go to United States firms the dollar cost will in many cases directly or indirectly fall on the U.K.). The raising of the general standard of living in the Middle East should offer further opportunities for increasing the sale of British consumer goods. 12. H.M.G. and the Fourth Point . The implementation of the Fourth Point by the United States will involve them in contributions both to the United Nations and bilaterally. The President has already asked Congress for &amp;U5 million, the distribution as between the United Nations and bilateral arrangements to be left to the President’s discretion. As far as the U.K. is concerned, apart from any specific contribution which we may make to the United Nations effort, the financial, material and technical resources which we make available to British overseas territories will undoubtedly form a major part of our general contribution to the cause of economic development. We will, in addition, certainly be expected to make further bilateral contributions, particularly in an area such as the Middle East with which we are so closely associated, and it will moreover be in our commercial as well as our political interests to do so. /The* The means of oontrihution open to us are:- (a) Technical . which may he of the following types - ( i ) The appointment of British officials to key posts f , in Middle East administration. (In certain exceptional cases of particular importance where the salaries offered by the Government concerned are not high enough to attract the right man, it may be necessary to consider subsidies from British 'official funds. The Committee has not however fully examined this problem. (A separate' paper is being prepared). (ii) The strengthening of the permanent and temporary staff of the Development Division of the B.M.S. 0. (iii) Increasing the facilities for Middle East technicians to undergo technical training in the U.K. and the Middle East. . . ('b) Financial and material (i) The very occasional grant of direct loans as in the case of the £1 million loan to Jordan. (ii) Support for applications for loans from the International Bank to member Governments and participation in such loans where appropriate. (iii) Approval for the raising of loans in the City of London by Middle East administrations. (iv) The release of sterling balances. (This must of course be considered in the context of our general policy governing sterling releases). (v) Assistance in the procurement of materials and equipment in short supply. 13# Conclusions and Recommendations . The pressing urgency of the economic problems of the Middle East will be apparent from the main points emerging from the country studies already referred to in the introduction to this paper. For the sake of conciseness, we /havehave not attempted to restate these problems at length, but this does not detract in any way from the great'need to do all within- our power to expedite developments on the lines set out briefly in this paper and its annexes. At the same time ' • * . . • . . . i there i s need for a word of caution. Any attempt to tackle f ... „ « * ; .... too much in too short a time could in fact result in a temporary depress-ion in the standard of living from its present low level, perhaps from some years. This would defeat our object. With adequate statistical information and more efficient administrations able to implement effectively the necessary economic and fiscal measures to support a period of substantial investment, it would be possible to assess more accurately the quantitative limit of investment activity which the economies of these countries could sustain without undue strain. But these circumstances do not exist. This seems to us to point to the need to proceed empirically, and not to attempt to make up our minds too soon on desirable commencement dates or relative priorities of projects outside a short list, selected both because of their immediate attractions and their long-term benefits. (See Annex A(l)). The measure of success attending the execution of these projects will serve as a useful indication of the ability of the countries concerned t o proceed with other suitable schemes (See Annex A(ll)). This does not mean that we should not be ready to express views on the sort of schemes which should follow, but merely that we should for the time being reserve our opinion on timing. It is recommended that: (1) (a) His Majesty's Government should encourage and assist (or continue to encourage and assist) the governments concerned to put into execution as soon as possible (subject to any further investigations which may be necessary) the projects listed in Annex A(l). This list includes: •: (i) projects which detailed examination has shown /to% to be of intrinsic merit, and which in certain cases offer good prospects of an early return; (ii) projects which will provide for the resettlement ^ of the Arab refugees; and (iii) projects which are of doubtful economic value, but on which work has already progressed so.far that it would be wasteful to stop at this stage. It is recommended that where practicable these projects shall be revised. (b) His Majesty’s Government should encourage the Governments concerned to undertake without delay the detailed examination, necessary before a decision regarding their execution can be taken, of the schemes listed in Annex A(ll) which preliminary surveys have indicated are likely to be economically sound. v (2) It should be accepted that this programme will involve the contribution by H.M.G. of certain limited technical, financial and material resources, but that the amount of this contribution cannot be accurately determined until it is known what contributions are available from the United States, the International Bank and other sources and until international policy with regard to the settlement of Arab refugees has been worked out in detail. (3) Early discussion on the basis of this programme should be held with the U.S. Government and the International Bank with a view to their accepting it as a concrete programme and making the greatest possible contributions to its implementation. (4) The programme should also be used as a brief for discussion with the Middle East governments concerned and in particular with Middle East Development Boards /asas soon as these are set,up in the hope that they will also adopt this programme or something as like it as possible and will make the maximum contributions towards its implementation.a small^mission of outside experts to revise the programme- 2 - TOt in Annex n A 1 I EXPenditUr ' e t0V pro ^ oots Total Internal Sxp nditure for projects in Annex A II ^ j listed listed Total £73,550,000 £42.300.^0 £115,850,000 Total External Expenditure for projects listec tp 4 . in Annex A I Total external Expenditure for projects listec in Annex A II Total £88,700,000 £51.400,000 £140,100,000 s' Grand Total £255,950,000&amp; ill KZ ' ^ ' ■ i 1 riIS ^pOCUUfflNT IS THE I-'ROPERTT OP HSI BRITaKNIG HiAJESTY’S G-OVERNIviENT) CONPIDEITTIx-iL M.E.(0)(49^ S 6 I * S .&gt; (8 '-so E.n.io.s.

Cabinet Office, S.W.l,. 5TH .vUGUST, 1949. (Signed) T.E. EV,;NS M. M. DU MERTON Joint Secretariesafesat:.., (81 7 U T0 THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES: nami'' &lt;•.. ! Qj J In o-rder to enable the United States, in cooperation with other countries, to assist the peoples of economically underdeveloped areas to raise their standards of living, X recommend the enactment of legislation to authorise an expanded program of technical assistance for such areas, and an experimental program for encouraging the outflow of private investment beneficial to their economic development. These measures are the essential first steps in an undertaking which will call upon private enterprise and voluntary organisations in the United States as well as the Government, to take part in a constantly growing effort to improve economic conditions in the less-developed regions of the world. The grinding poverty and the lack of economic opportunity for many millions of people in the economically underdeveloped parts of Africa, the Near and Far East, and certain regions of Central and South America, constitute one of the greatest challenges of the world today. In spite of their age-old economic and social handicaps, the peoffles in these areas have in recent decades been stirred and awakened. The spread of industrial civilisation, the growing understanding of modern concepts of government, and the impact of two World Wars have changed their lives and their outlook. They are eager to play a greater part in the community of nations. All these areas have a common problem. They must create a firm economic base for the democratic aspirationo of their citizens. Without such an economic base, they Will be unable to meet the expectations which the modern world has aroused in their peoples. If they are frustrated and disappointed, they may turn to false doctrines which hold that they way of progress lies through tyranny. For the United States the great awakening of these peoples holds tremendous promise. It is not only a promise that new and stronger nations will be associated with us in the cause of human freedom, it is also a promise of new economic strength and growth for ourselves. With many of the economically underdeveloped areas of the world, we have long had ties of trade and. commerce. In many instance's today we greatly need the products of their labor and their resources. If the productivity and the purchasing power of these countries are expanded, our own. industry and agriculture will benefit. Our experience shows that the volume of our foreign trade is far greater with highly developed countries than it is with countries having a low standard of living and inadequate industry. To increase the output and the national income of the lees developed regions is to increase^our own economic stability# Th. addition, the development of these areas is of utmost importance to our efforts to restore the economies of the free European nations. As the economies -of the underdeveloped areas expand, they will provide needed products for Europe and will offer a better market for / EuropeanI 2 ~ ,. European gooda. Such expansion is an essential part of the growing system of world trade $ which is necessary for European recovery. ^ Furthermore , the development of these areas will strengthen the United Nations and the fabric of world peace. The xjreamhle to the Charter of the United Nations states that the economic and social advancement of all people is an essential 'bulwark of 'peace. Under article 56 of the Charter # we have promised to take separate action and to act jointly with other nations 'to promote higher standards of living, full employment„ and conditions of economic and social progress and development.' For these various reasons, assistance in the development of the economically underdeveloped areas has . hecpme one. of the major elements of our foreign policy. ’'in my inaugural address’I outlined a program, to help the. peoples, of. these areas to attain greater production as a waypto prosperity and peace. •, • The major effort in such a program must he local in character; it must he made by the people of the under developed areas themselves. It is essential, however, to the success of their effort that there be help from abroad. In some cases the peoples of these areas will.he unable to begin their part- of this great' enterprise. without initial aid from other countries. .. • The aid that is needed falls roughly into two categories: The first is the technical, scientific, and managerial knowledge, necessary to economic development. This category includes not only medical and educational knowledge, and assistance and advice in such basic fields as sanitation, communications, road building* and governmental services, hut also, and perhaps the most’ important, assistance in the survey of resources and in planning for long-range economic development. The second category is production goods - machinery and equipment - and financial assistance in the creation of productive enterprises. The underdeveloped areas need a' capital for port and harbour development, roads and communications, irrigation and drainage projects, as well as for public utilities and the whole fange of extraction processing, and manufacturing industries* Much of the / Capital required can be provided by these areas themselves, In spite of their low standards of living. But much must come from abroad. The two categories of aid are closely related, Technical assistance is necessary to lay the groundwork for productive investment 4 Investment, in turn, brings, with it•technical assistance* In general however,^ technical surveys of resources and of the possibilities of economic development'must i^ecede substantial capital investment. Furthermore,• in many of the areas concerned, technical assistance in improving sanitation, communications, / or \or education is required to create conditions in Which capital investment can he fruitful. ^ • .This country, in recent years, has conducted relatively modest programs of technical cooperation with other countries. IrL the field of education, channels of exchange and communication have heen opened between our citizens and those of other countries. To some extent, the expert assistance of a number of Federal agencies, such as the Public Health Service and the Department of Agriculture, has been made available to other countries# We'have also participated in the activities of the United Nations, its specialised agencies, and other international organisations to disseminate useful techniques among nations. # * 1 • • Through these various activities v/e have gained considerable experience in rendering technical assistance to other countries. What is needed now is to expand and . integrate these activities and to concentrate them particularly' on the’economic development of underdeveloped ’• : areas. rr Much of the aid that is needed'can be provided most effectively through the United Nations. Shortly after my inaugural address this Government asked the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations to consider what the ' United Nations and the specialised international agencies r could do in this program. ,r -'' The Secretary General of the United Nations thereupon asked the United Nations Secretariat and the secretariats of the specialised international agencies to draw., up cooperative plans for technical assistance to underdeveloped areas. Ac a result, a survey v/as made of technical projects ^suitable for these agencies in such fields as industry, labor, agriculture, scientific research with respect to natural resources, and fiscal management. The total cost of .the program submitted as a result of this survey was estimated to be about #35,000*000 for the first year. It is expected that 'the United Nations and the specialised international agencies will shortly adopt programs for carrying out projects of the type included in this survey. In addition to our participation in this work of the United Nations-, much of the technical assistance required can be provided directly by the United States to countries needing it. A careful examination of the existing information concerning the underdeveloped countries shows particular need for technicians and experts with United States training • in plant and animal diseases, malaria and typhus control,, water supply and sewer systems, metallurgy.and mining, and nearly all phases of industry. It has already been shown that experts in these fields can bring about tremendous improvements. For example, the health of the people of many foreign communities has been greatly improved by the work of United States sanitory engineers in setting 'up modern water-supply systems. The— 4 - food supply of many areas lias been increased as the result of the advice of United States agricultural experts in the control of animal diseases and the improvement of crops* ^ These are only examples of the wide range of benefits ' resulting from the careful a'pplication of modern techniques to local problems* The benefits which.a comprehensive program of expert assistance will make possible con only be revealed by studies and surveys undertaken as part of the program itself. To inaugurate the program p I recommend a first-year • appropriation of not to exceed #45,000,000. This includes # 10 . 000.000 already requested in the 1950 budget activities of this character. The sum recommended will cqvbv both our participation in the programs of the international agencies and the assistance to he provided directly, by the United'States. In every case, whether the operation is conducted through the United Nations, the other international agencies, or directly by the United States, fchu country receiving the benefit of the aid will be required to bear a substantial portion of the expense* The activities necessary to carry out our program of technical aid will be diverse in character and will have to be performed by a number of different Government agencies and private instrumentalitios. It will be necessary to utilize not only the resources of international agencies the United States Government, but also the facilities and the experience of the private business and nonprofit organisations that have long been active m this work. Since a number of Federal agencies will be involved 111 the program, X recommend that the administration oi the program be vested in the President, with authority to delegate to the Secretary of State and to other Government officers, as may be appropriate. With such administrative flexibility, it will be possible to modify the management of the program as it expands and to meet the practical problems that will arise in its administration in the future. The second category of outside aid needed by r he underdeveloped areas is the provision of capital for the creation of productive enterprises. The International ? ank for Reconstruction and Development and the AXi^ort-: mport Bank have provided same capital for under developed areas, and, as the economic growth of these areas progresses, should be expected to provide a great deal more# In addition, private sources of funds must be encouraged to provide a major part of the capital required. In view of the present troubled condition the distortion of world trade, the shortage : oi other aftereffects of the war — ohe problem oi increasing the flow of American •capital abroad serious difficulties. In all probability novel of the world - dollars, and substantially presents devices / willf v/ill have to 'be employed if the investment from this country is to reach proportions sufficient to carry out the objectives . ;&lt;?£-. our program. All countries concerned with the program should work ..'together to bring about conditions favorable to the flow of private capital. To this end we are negotiating agreements with other countries to protect the American investor from unwarranted or discriminatory treatment under the laws of the country in which he makes his investment. In negotiating such treaties we do not, of course, ask privileges fox* American capital greater than those granted to other investors :in underdeveloped countries or greater than we ourselves grant in this country. -We believe that American enterprise should no.t waste local resources, should provide adequate v/ages and working conditions for local labor, and should bear an equitable share:of the burden of local taxes* At the. same time we believe that investors will send their capital abroad on an increasing scale only if they are given assurance against risk of loss through expropriation 'Without, compensation, unfair, or discriminatory treatment, destruction through war or rebellion, or the inability to convert their earnings!into dollars. Although our investment treaties will be directed at mitigating such risks,.they cannot eliminate them entirely^ With the best will in the world a foreign country, particularly an underdeveloped.country, may not be able to obtain the dollar exchange necessary for the prompt remittance of earnings on dollar capital. Damage or loss resulting from internal and international violence may be beyond the power of our treaty signatories to control. Many of these conditions of-instability in underdeveloped areas v/hich deter foreign investment are themselves a consequence of the lack of economic development v/hich only foreign investment can cure* Therefore * to wait until stable conditions are assured before encouraging the- outflow of capital to underdeveloped, areas would defer the attainment of our objectives indefinitely. It is necessary to take vigorous action now to break out of this vicious circle. Since the development of underdeveloped economic areas is of major importance in cur foreign policy,, it is appropriate to use the resources of the Government to accelerate private efforts toward that end. I recommend, therefore, that the Export-Import Bank be authorised to guarantee United States private capital, invested in productive enterprises abroad which contribute to economic development in underdeveloped areas, against the risks peculiar to those investments. This guaranty activity will at the outset be largely experimental. Some investments may require only a guaranty against the danger of inconvertibility, others may need protection against the danger of expatriation and other dangers as well. It is impossible at this time to write a standard guaranty. The bank will, of course, be able to require the payment of premiums for such protection, but there is no way now to determine what premium rates v/ill be / most- r - O - most appropriate in the long run. Only experience, can provide answers to these questions. ^ The hank has sufficient resources at the present time to begin the guaranty program and to carry on its lending activities as.well without any increase in its authorised funds. If the demand for guaranties should prove large*' and lending activities continue on the scale expected* it will be necessary to request the Congress at a later date- to increase the authorised funds of the bank. The enactment of those two legislative proposals, the first pertaining to technical assistance, and the second to the encouragement of foreign investment, will constitute a national endorsement of a program of major importance in our efforts for world peace and economic stability. Nevertheless, these measures are only the first steps* We are here embarking on h venture that extends far into the future. We are at the beginning of a rising curve of activity, private, governmental, and international* that will continue for.many years to come. It is all the more important,'therefore* that we start promptly. ,• In the economically, underdeveloped areas of the world . today there are new creative energies. We look forward to the time ytfien these countries will be stronger and more independent than they are now, and yet more closely hound to us and to ether nations by ties of friendship and commerce, and by kindred ideals. On the other hand* unless we aid the newly awakened spirit in these peoixLes to find the course of fruitful development, they may fall under tha control of those whose philosophy is hostile to human freedom, thereby prolonging the unsettled state of the world-and postponing.the achievement of permanent peace* Before the peoples of these areas we hold out the promise of a. better future through the democratic way of life. It is vital that we move quickly to britlg the meaning of that promise home to them in their daily lives. ; Harry G. Truman.

The spectacular rise in production from this area has not yet however given it a preponderance over the older established fields elsewhere in terms of production. Prom producing a mere 6 per cent of world supplies in 1939 , the Middle Ea'st by a three-fold rise in output now supplies 12 per cent and, with an anticipated further tripling of production will (on present estimates of the trend in world consumption) represent 2? per cent of the world total by 1956. 2. In these calculations the production of the U.S.S.R, and satellites has not been included: except for insignificant shipments the total production of this area is consumed within the Soviet Union and her satellites, and there is little likelihood that this pattern will alter in the foreseeable future. Apart from this the bulk of Middle East production enters into world trade through the channels of either British or United States Companies, in 1948, out of a total oil production in the fiddle East of 56.5 million tons, 31*2 millions represented the share of British (including Anglo- Dutch) controlled companies and 24.55 millions that of United States companies. By 1956 the British share should on present estimates rise to 80.4 million tons (out of a total of 154«5 millions) while that of the United States should, on the same basis, increase to 66.55 millions. The only other interested Power is Prance whose Compagnie Prancaise des Petroles holds an interest in Iraq. 3. As a result, the Governments of the United Kingdom and of the United States find themselves intimately interested in Middle East oil development. Both governments have been anxious to ensure an increasing flow of production from the Middle East, the British because such imports represent a dollar saving and the Americans because the increase in the domestic demand of the U.S.A. has changed that country from a net exporter to a net importer. 4. With regard to oil concessions and production, there has been in recent years increasing participation of American interests, independently and in co-operation with British companies. Details of these activities will be found in the various chapters dealing with countries separately. Oil development in the two main producing countries, Iran and Saudi Arabia, continues to be undertaken independently, respectively by British and American concessionaires which latter also hold the concession for Bahrein State. The oilfield in Kuwait State, which .has become next in importance as a producer, is being developed by a company, owned in equal shares by British and American concerns. In Iraq, the other major oil producing country in the Middle East, apart from a /small (1) This paper is a revision of a study prepared over four years ago.small area conceded to a British company, the oil concessions are held by an international undertaking comprising British, American, French and Dutch interests. The concession for 0 ^ Qatar, which is still in the early stages of development, io held by the same combine. The oilfields in Sgypt are being developed by British and American companies. The development of oil resources by British and United States companies has had a significant effect on the economies of the countries concerned. In most of the states the rentals, royalties and other payments provide the largest item of the governmental revenues. In 1948 no less than £24.9 millions were paid in royalties to these Governments and with negotiations in progress for raising royalty rates in Iran and Iraq, it is certain that royalty receipts will rise very rapidly. Even if royalty rates remained the same, Middle East governments v/ould be drawing £62.4 millions from the oil companies in 1956. Local expenditure other then royalties is expected to amount to £ 69.2 millions in 1949* The element of current expenditure in'this total may be assumed to rise at approximately the same rate as royalty payments. The element of capital expenditure may, however, be expected to fall, since the majority of projects now in hand are expected to be completed with the next three to four years. 6 . Oil and the Oil Companies have thus become dominating factors in the political and economic lives of Persia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Trucial Sheikdoms and are of no mean significance in the oth'-r Middle East States. In the further expansion, on the scale at present envisaged, the main features are thus likely to be:- ( 1 ) the increasing’wealth which will accrue to the Middle Eastern States and the use to v/hichthis will be put; ( 2 ) the stimulating influence which, by example and direct effect, rapid development of the oilfields v.ill have upon the economic and social progress of the Middle East countries; (3) the economic interest of the United States and, the Western European and Co.-i. .onwealth countries, in Middle East oil developments; (4) the growing awareness of the oil-producing Middle East States of the position which this development of their oil resources is creating for them in World affiars. To fulfil this position and adequately to guide the accompanying internal developments into profitable, channels and to maintain satisfactory relations with the oil companies (for which there can be no substitutes at this stage), are bound to impose a considerable strain upon the present inadequate school of local statesmanship.C' / I • EGYPT 6 .

In 1923/U the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Royal J^tch Shell unsuccessfully carried out a geological survey of^fhe area between the coast and the watershed of the Red Sea mountains, covering an area of some 10,000 squaresmiles. No promising oil prosioects were indicated and no exploratory drilling was undertaken. III. ERITREA 12. As part of the campaign for Italian self sufficiency the Government-owned Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli began exploratory drilling in the Dahlaq Islands (lying east of Massawaj some two years before World War No. 2. Some indications °i oil were discovered but the war caused operations to be abandoned before conclusive results could be obtained. While the status of the colony is formally undecided there is no prospect of renewed explorationr IV* BRITISH SOMALILAND 13. ihe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1918/20 and the Anglo-baxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell) in 1931 carried out geological surveys in the Protectorate. In both cases it was decided that, although there were some seepages and a small anticlinal structure at Daga Shabell, 30 miles south of Berbera, the prospects of commercial exploitation were too small to warrant drilling. 14. In April 1944 an exploration licence covering 27.000 square miles, including Daga Shabell, was granted to the Somaliland Oil Exploration Company, Ltd, This company's shares are held as to 50% by Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields, Ltd., ocr 0 $ y ^ el ^ | 0ver&gt;seas Exploration Company, Limited, and O/o by the D ^rcy Exploration Company, Limited. The operating company reported in December 1948 that their investigations of the concession territory have shown that there is no prospect of obtaining commercial production of oil from the western part of the area (which includes Daga Shabell). The 2^ or ^ tl ? n ^ llcenoe ex Pired in April 1949 . The company have been granted a new exploration licence covering 23,500 sauare miles of the south-ezstern part of British Somaliland. Further exploration work is dependent on the results of a deep test well which is being drilled by the Sinclair Oil Corporation m the adjoining Ethiopian province of Ogaden. V. ETH IOPIA 1%' In September 1945 the Sinclair Oil Corporation obtained a fifty year concession for oil exploration and development covering the whole area of Ethiopia. The Corporation incorporated in New York in September 1919 as the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation and assuming its present name 1943 has extensive oil interests, producing refining and marketing, in the U.S.A., Venezuela and elsewhere. A rather unsavoury early history culminating in the ’’Teapot Dome” scandal brought Mr. Harry Sinclair into disrepute. The Corporation was refused a concession in Persia in 1924 and a /fewfew years later it explored Portuguese Angola without finding oil* In January 1948 it made an unsuccessful attempt at bidding for the Kuwait share of the Neutral Zone. In Ethiopia activities have been’concentrated in the Ogaden area where the first exploration well was spudded in May 1949# VI. TURKEY' 16. Oil in significant quantities has only recently been found in Turkey. An oil bearing anticline running east and west through the mountain of Ramandag. some 80 miles east of Diyarbekir and 10 south of Besiri in South Eastern Turkey brought in about 50 tons of heavy oil per day from a well 1,300 metres deep in March 1948 and the installation of pumps and the bringing in of a second well has since raised production to about 120—140 tons per day. The present rate of production, equivalent to some 46,000 tons per year, represents one tenth of Turkish annual consumption. A small refinery of a primitive nature has been built at Maymoune, near the fields with a capacity ol 150 tons per day. The Minister for Economy and Commerce has prepared a plan for a pipeline to and a refinery at s enderun costing £T 300 million. In accordance with the policy of the Turkish Government to concentrate economic development m its own hands, no concessions to foreign companies are envisaged. Work on the Ramandag field has been carried out by the Drilling and Exploration Company of Dallas, U.S.A. as contractors to the Turkish Government. Discussions for a joint participate 61 ^ COmpany have been mooted and Socony-Vacuum may 17.

Drilling was carried out between 1939 and 1941 in the neighbourhood of Palmyra, Bichri and Jebel Sinjar. In 1947 and 1948 the Company drilled unsuccessful exploratory wells at Baflioun 30 miles N.N.W. of Aleppo, at Dolaa, 95 miles S.E. and Toual Abba 115 miles E. of Aleppo, 24. The Iraq Petroleum Company’s pipeline from Kirkuk to Tripoli (Lebanon) crosses Syrian territory and a 16-inch line is under construction to parallel the 12 -inch line. Their proposal for a 30-inch line from Kirkuk to Banias (capacity 13 million tons a year) is still in the planning stage. ^ 25. An agreement was signed and ratified in June 1949 between ^ o ? ov ernment and Middle East Pipelines Ltd. in respect ?'• 7 o4/36-inch pipeline, with an annual capacity of million* 1 * tons, to be constructed from Iran and Kuwait to Tartus, on the Syrian coast. The pipeline company is a subsidiary of Standard of New Jersey and Socony Vacuum, the £?nn 1 S ^T?? rtn + r su 5 scpibin £ £35 million and the U.S. partners 01 0 million towards the estimated cost of the project. The pipeline i's expected to be completed by 1953.

Exploratory drilling was commenced in February 1948 and oil of good quality and in commercial quantities has been discovered at Zubair and Nahr Umr# Plans are proceeding for the development of these fields, the concession requiring a minimum production of one million tons in 1952 . The royality payments are the same as those for the Mosul Concession. ( iv ) Khanaqin Oil Company Limited. 46. The Khanaqin Oil Company was formed in 1925 in order to acquire from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (the name was changed to Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1935) the oil-bearing area known as Naft Khaneh. The area in which this field is situated formerly belonged to Persia and formed part of the D Arcy concession, but it was allocated to Turkey, together with a larger area north-east of Khanaqin, by the Turco- Commission in 1913~ , 14. The concessionary rights of the A.P.O.C, in these two areas were recognised first by the Turkish Government and later by the Government ca P^^ a l 'the Khanaqin Oil Company is £1,000,000* all the shares so far issued are held by the A.I.O.C. 46. Production is at the rate of 400,000 tons per annum. The crude oil is pumped from the field through a 25-mile pipe-line to a refinery at Alwand, 3 miles S.E. of Khanaqin. The products are marketed throughout Iraq by the Rafidain Oil Company, another A.I.O.C. subsidiary. Extensions to the rf^nery have been approved and it is anticipated that by 1953 the annual throughput capacity will have reached some 600,000 tons. 49. Oil has also been found .at Chiah Surkh, and the Khanaqin Oil Company have plans to develop these resources in order to maintain supplies to the Alwand Refinery, XIII SAUDI ARABIA 50. An oil concession covering about 318,000 square miles of the Nejd and Hasa Provinces of Saudi Arabia was in the first place acquired by the Standard Oil Company of California in May 1933 Tor a term of 60 years. In 1936 the Texas Company secured a 5 G/c interest and a joint operating company designated the California Arabian Standard Oil Company was formed. By a further agreement made in May 1939, the concession territory was extended to some 440,000 square miles. In addition preferential rights were obtained^in respect of about 177,000 square miles, and also Saudi Arabia’s half interest’in the two small Neural Zones, shared respectively with the neighbouring States of Kuwait1%) / 65 . m°*+ n Petroleum concoBsion covering the Kuwait share of the Neutral Zone was granted in June 1948 to the Aneriean ,,^fS e +v en v 0 ^ 1 c °™P an y* Q group of United States oil companies ^L? he leadership of: the Phillips Oil Company. The bidding for this share culminated in May 1948 with final offers from ^™eric£in Independent Oil Company, the Burmah Oil Company, and the Gulf Oil Corporation. The financial terms of the V concession secured by the American Independent Oil Company, comrpised an initial payment of 67,250,000 to the Sheikh, an annual sum of ^625,000 as rent or minimum royalty.

BAHREIN 66 . Rights were obtained from the Sheikh of Bahrein (who is under British Protection) by the Eastern and General Syndicate in 1925# This Syndicate through lack of financial backing, was as little able to make anything of these as in’ other areas in Arabia and Kuwait, where it had obtained rights, and sold its Bahrein rights in December 1928 to the Standard Oil Company of California, The transfer did not become fully operative until December 1934, pending discussions between His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government arising from the special status of British interests in the island. A solution was effected by the registration as a British Company (in Canada) of the Bahrein Petroleum Company set up as a subsidiary by Standard Oil of California. In 1936, the Texas COn^any became an equal partner in the-Bahrein Petroleum Company. . ■ &lt; ' ■ 67 . The original- Oil Mining Lease of December 1934 was for about two-thirds of the main island until 19S9« By a Deed made in June 1940, the oil rights and privileges already granted were extended not only to an ’additional area* but to the whole of the Sheikh of Bahrein*b’present and future dominions* for a term of 55 years until June 1995, prolonged after the war to 1999 i.e# by the period of the wartime moratorium on development of the ’additional area*. With the object of allowing the company to resume investigations in areas hitherto subject to dispute between the Sheiks of Bahrein and Qatar, H.M.G. has recently fixed a boundary line dividing the waters between'the two States, Persia intermittently makes a claim &lt;on historical grounds to Bahrein, Which has been refuted by H.M.G. as having no validity. 68 . The only oilfield, discovered in 1932, is situated on the main Bahrein .island. Drilling was suspended in 1940 and resumed in March 1946. The crude oil annual output has been stabilised at 1.5 million tons, further ^expansion of production being unlikely. A royalty rate of* Rs. 3, § annas (5s. 3d) per ton is provided for under the 1934 Lease, subject however to revision in 1949. Exploration drilling is being carried out in the ’additional area*. . ■ 69 . A refinery was erected in 1936 at Awali, nine miles south of Manama, Bahrein’s capital. Since then it has been considerably enlarged; in 1948 the throughput of crude oil amounted to about 7.5 million tons of which 6 million consisted of oil imported from Saudi Arabia,, mostly by means of the pipeline (partly submarine) direct from Daranam oil field to the refinery and the remainder by tanker. About 7 million tons of refined productions were shipped in 1948 and marketed by the California Texas Oil Co.

JMotning further has, however, emerged.* • k representative of the Compagnie Pranpaise des Petroles (-partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company) passed through San’a in 1947 stating he^was investigating oil deposits and the old Imam was unaerstood to have engaged an engineer, one Dahtzker. to prospect for oil. - The . disappointin ^ survey results obtained in neighbouring territories, Asir and Aden, do not give any ? :)elievln S that better results will be achieved possibility f Early U? 1948 ’ I * p ’ c * were considering the possibilities of acquiring a concession, but the indeterminate political situation has prevented any negotiations. , ^ XXIII. IRAN 91. Iran is the fourth largest oil producer in the world and the leading Middle Eastern producer. In 1948 Iranian output was 24,871,000 tons and-within eight years is expected to be not far short of double this, at 42 , 000,000 tons. Only the western and south-western regions have as yet been extensively prospected and developed, and it is possible that the north, which borders the Soviet Caucasian lields, may be.a productive area. 92 92, A concession was obtained by William Knox D’Aroy in 1901 covering the whole of Iran except the then ''Russian sphere of, influence”, viz. the northern provinces of I f a2anderan &gt; Gurgan and Khurasan. Two 8 urkh and Mamatain, were tested without success before oil was discovered at Masjid-i-Sulaiman ih 1908 . The Anglo-Pe.rsian Oil Company (now the Anglo-1 rani an Oil Company) took over D'Arcy's rights in 1909 and in 1913 His Majesty s Government acquired a voting interest of 52.6 per cent with the right to veto any resolutions of its board or subsidiaries without prejudice to its commercial management*9 93t In November 1932 the Company f s manager in Persia was handed a note by the Persian Government declaring the concession cancelled on the grounds of the Company^ failure to accept certain modifications and subsequently the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs stated that the stipulations of the Concession were not in accord with the legitimate interests of Persia* His Maoesty f s Government iniormed the Persian Government that their action in cancelling^the Concession was a wholly inadmissible &amp; n d asked for an immediate withdrawal. as the Persian Government persisted in their refusal of this demand 9 His Majesty's Government submitted the matter to the Council of the League of Nations. At a meeting of the Council in February 1933 it was announced that the two parties had agreed to suspend all proceedings. a u^ &gt;e ? ::Ln ® en ^ er into negotiations for a new concession which was finalised and ratified in Tehran on the 28th May 1933. Under this concession (valid until 1993) it was agreed that by 1938 an area of 100,000 square miles woula be selected* The main area selected extends from the Iraq frontier north of Qasr*.i~Shirin to the entrance to the Persian Gulf near Jask. 94* chief producing fields lie in a compact line in the foothills of the Zagros Mountains. Some 100 miles north from the extremity of the Persian Gulf, Masjid-i-Sulaiman was the sole producing field until ^ 4 'soovery in 1928 of the Haft Kel structure. Adjacent to this field is a structure known as Naft Safid, so named from seepage of condensate in the locality. To the South Fast, lie the two fields discovered in 1937, Agha lari and Pazanun, which latter, a gas producer only, is at present shut in. The most southerly field, that of Gach Saran, was discovered in 1929. Since the war a new field north oi Masjid—i*~Sulaiman has been opened at Lali and contains the most productive single well yet drilled in the world. The Gach Saran and Agha Jari fields hold the greater part of Iran's proven resources of crude oil* 93# Much further to the north west, on the Iraq frontier, lies the Naft-i-Shah field, discovered in 1923 but not Drought into production until 1935* Its production is small compared to those of the southern fields and is piped to Kermanshah (146 miles of 3 inch pipe) fgr refining for local consumption. The X)§irt of the field lying over the Iraq frontier (Naft Khaneh) is also worked by A.I.0.0. (cf. Paragraph 46). # 96* The total capacity of the internal pipeline sys*tem, 1,060 miles in length, is over 22 million tons per annum and is under further extension. All the southern fields are linked to Abadan with 10 or 12 inch pipes. A new line from Agha Jari to Abadan is 20/22 inch. towards^the end of 1946, A.I.O.C. concluded an agreement with Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony Vacuum, contingent' on the building of a rjipeline to the Mediterranean coast irom the Persian and Kuwait oilfields, whereby the two American Companies would purchase substantial quantities of crude oil over a 10 to 20 year period. Middle Fast Pipelines Ltd., British registered, was formed in 1947, to build and operate the line. A.I.O.C. own 60.9^ of the £10 million capital, S.O.N.J. 24.7% and Socony Vacuum 14.4/o. /ItIt is planned to complete a 34/36-inch pipeline from Abadan with a branch from Kuwait, by 1951-52. The initial capacity will be o million tons per annum, 40 % of which will be provided out of A.I.O.C. s 50% share in Kuwait oil production. A.I.O.C. s share of the cost of constructing the pipeline, pumping stations, storage tanks, terminal facilities and harbour works is estimated at £35 million: the American share is estimated at $100 million. The Mediterranean terminal is to oe at Tartus, on the Syrian coast# A pipeline agreement with the Syrian Government was made Jun 9 1949* It is intended to erect a refinery at Tartus (see Section IX, Syria) for which purpose Maritime in 1948 6S ' wb °lly owned by A.I.O.G., was registered 98« The Abadan refinery is the largest in the world with an annual capacity of 23 , 600,000 tons. 99» Negotiations respecting a revision of the royalty terms are currently proceeding between A.I.O.C. and the Persian Government, t 100. The possibility of oil in areas other than those conceded to the A.I.O.C. has led to numerous efforts by ^ her ^ GOnc ff ns to 0 ' btain concessions. Chief among these have been the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey {paragraphs 101 104), the Sinclair Oil Company (paragraph a f Pan 9 b ~ Bel £ian group, the Soci£td Franco-Persane do Recherches (Paragraph 106), the Seaboard Oil Company (paragraphs 107 - 110), a Persian concern, the Kavir Khurian Company (paragraphs 112 - 116), an associate of the Shell group (paragraph 11?) and the Soviet Government (paragraphs 118 - 120 ). Details of these companies efforts are given m the following paragraphs. ( a ) The Khostharia Cone ession 101. in 1916 a Georgian adventurer named Khostharia acquired a small concession in the province of Mazandaran based uoon decree) granted in I 896 . In the same year Khostharia obtained from the Persian Government a mubh more ? nS ^ e +£ 0nCe ? S £ on cover,in £ 'the rest of Mazandaran and the Tr? nei £ hboaPln g provinces of Gilan and Astarabad. ^917 this concession was extended to cover the district oi Ardabil, m Azerbaijan. The A.I.O.C. acquired this concession in 1920 and formed a company named North Persian t0 operate it. The A.I.O.C. thereupon notified the ^ GoV in^ en i u oi ti:ie com Pletion of the transfer. On the '? he Persian Government informed the company that the Khostharia concession was for several reasons regarded as nuli and void. The situation took on a new aspic? whin the Persian and Sovi.et Government signed a Treaty of Friendship at Tehran on the 26th February, 1921. By article XII 01 this treaty Soviet Russia declared that all concessions (with certain exceptions specified in the treaty) obtained by the Tsarist Government and its subjects were null and void, and that the said concessions were therefore restored 'to the Persian Government as representing the Persian peopie.' By article XIII the Persian Government, for their part, promised 'not to cede to a third Power or to its subjects the concessions and property thus restored to Persia, and to maintain these rights for the Persian nation.' /102. m102 * ^ n J . June 1921 the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey +£ pl iy-u d t ? e Pers ian Government for a concession covering the Khostharia areas. The British Legation immediately lodged a protest with^ the Persian Government on behalf of A * I ; 0,C# W J S informed in reply that the Khostharia concession was no longer valid. Meanwhile, the Standard Oil oo. continued to press for its concession, and in Ma ^ lis a PPnoved the grant of the oil rights in the northern provinces to that concern. Immediately this action became known, both the British and Soviet Governmerrcs protested strongly, the former because of the legea infringement of the A a I.O.C. , s rights and the latter because of the terms of the 1921 treaty. In order thc difficulty occasioned by this treaty, the addressed a note on the 12th December, t + e . ul P loinatic Hepresentative at Tehran to the erieot that the Majlis desired the retrocession of o^| S +S n cancessio ns to be without reserve or condition, n^ d +^ hePel01&gt; f aske d for the treaty to be revised accordingly. On the same date the Soviet Diplomatic Representative sent h-d U ^-vni y /f g h+ r epl y c After sta ting that his Government ^ ver ?? ugh ^ to Place any restriction upon the progress and prosperity of Persia”, he went on to say: ”1 would be betw^n d th„%w * s ^, ould friendly relations be maintained between the tv/o nations, to promote negotiations with a view to a total or partial revision of these articles on the d + sir 2 d J 3y ? he Persian Government, as far as the interests of Russia permit”. had Peached a deadlock, the A.I.O.C. and the Stc.ndc.rd Oil Company agreed to act together on a footing of equality, with the result that the latter acquired a 50 per cent interest in North Persian on a 9 • than snno-h-f- + reroian oils, Ltd. The two companies w n +h« U f ht 1 J ly to secure th e grant of a new concession, Government refused, partly because of the difficulty with Soviet Russia and partly because a new the slnclair oil Corporation, had appeared on the scene (see paragraph 95 below), olaimt 1 in°^nhh^ h p P rf lan A lls ’ Ltd * has never renounced Us northern Persia, it is now many years since it last attempted to press them. In 19'5 the name of the comnanv was changed to North Iranian Oils, Ltd. company (^) The Sinclair Conces s ion . 105.

This concession was surrendered in June, 1938, when the Amiranian and Inland Exploration companies abandoned their concessions in, respectively, Persia and Afghanistan, (f) The Kavir Khurian Company 112 , Khostharia, having acquired certain of the rights conferred by a farman which had been granted many years previously to a Persian known as the Amin al-Ma’adin, registered the Kavir Khurian Company in Tehran in 1925 in order to exploit the oil deposits in the desert region (kavir) to the south of Semnan, some 110 miles to the east of the capital. The fact that the company was registered does not necessarily imply that it has any valid claim to concessionary rights. 113• Although the company was established on a somewhat flimsy basis, Khostharia, who was on its board, showed great activity on its behalf. He persuaded the Russian Bank to furnish the bulk of the capital, and distributed a number of shares in a judicious manner to certain influential Persians. At a later date Khostharia offered a^holding in the company to French and Italian interests, with the result that the former sent a party of geologists to examine the company’s area. It is believed that their report was unfavourable; on the other hand, a leading Soviet geologist named Golubniatnikov is said to have formed a different opinion. 114# As soon as the A.I.O.C. heard of the registration of this company, it had protested to the Persian Government on the grounds that Seihnan lay within the area of the D’Arcy concession. The Government, however, maintained that Semnan was in the province of Khurasan and that it was therefore not within the A.I.O.C.’s concessionary area, 115* Up tothe present only two wells have been drilled, and commercial production has not been obtained. 116. Shortly after the Allied entry into Persia in the autumn of 1941, the question of this company was, it is believed, discussed by the Persian Government and the Soviet Embassy; the former is said to have maintained that the company’s title was not valid and that a new agreement would have to be negotiated before the area could be exploited. When M. Kavtaradze, the Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tehran at the beginning of September, 1944, the ostensible object for his visit was the study of the position of the Kavir Khurian Company. (g) The N.V, Algemeeno Sxploratie Maatschappij . 117# On the 11th August, 1939&gt; the Persian Government granted the N.V. Algemeene Sxploratie Maatschappij, a Dutch concern connected with the Royal Dutch-Shell group, an exploration concession, valid for two years, for minerals (including petroleum) in western and north-western Persia* This area, which covered some 32,000 square miles, was an elongated quadrilateral of irregular shape running from near Tabriz in the north-west to a point south of Kashan in the south-east. The length was 420 miles, and the average width was 80 miles. /An/122. t?nntP^ Si vvLS f + i fc - iis c ?

(D Iranian State Co-operation . T i le . A ?t passed by the Majlis on 22nd October 1947 cancelling: the Soviet Iranian Oil Company Agreement stated that 'the g grant of any kind of concession to. foreigners for the extraction of the oil of the country and 'its by-products and the creation of any kind of company for this purpose in which x oreigners are in any manner shareholders is absolutely oil exploitation must, in consequence of this clause, be carried out by Iranians and the Act laid it down that 'the Government shall make arrangements for a technical and scientific survey with a. view to the discovery of oil deposits and shall within a period of five years complete technical and scientific maps of the oil-bearing areas so that the Majlis shall be able ..„ to make arrangements for commercial exploitation'. s nLS122* In February 1948 as a result of this Law the Government set up a department for the exploration of oil and mineral resources, under an Iranian engineer, Bagher Mostafi. Iranian128/ XXIV, AFGHANISTAN 123* No oil is produced in Afghanistan and all petroleum products are imported by a State petroleum monopoly, either over the Pakistan border (Shell, Socony-Vacuum and Caltex being the chief suppliers) or from the Soviet Union, 124# In 1927 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (as it was then called) was unofficially offered a concession covering Afghanistan, but it declined the offer on the grounds that the Tirpul area between Herat and the Indian frontier, where there are oil indications, was in the Russian economic sphere and that the inaccessibility of the area made it commercially unattractive. The Burmah Oil Company and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company likewise considered the possibility of taking up a concession in Afghanistan, but they also gave up the idea, because the remoteness of the area from seaboard would have rendered development work extremely costly, while, if oil were found, the cost of a pipe-line to some point on the coast of Makran or the Persian Gulf would be prohibitive. 123. Undeterred by these objections, two United States companies, the Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware and the Texas Corporation, formed a joint concern called the Inland Exploration Company of America with a capital of #5,050,333 for the purpose of negotiating for and .exploiting a concession in Afghanistan, A concession agreement was signed by representatives of the Afghan Government and the company in Berlin on the 19th November, 1936, This agreement was modified in Kabul on the 18 th January, 1938, in order to embody certain of the provisions of the Amiranian Oil Company’s concession in Persia, which were more favourable to the Government, 126, The exploration area covered the whole of Afghanistan, but the company was bound by the terms of its concession to select within 3 years five areas for exploitation, the rest of the area being abandoned. 127 127 , The company’s geologists carried out surveys in the north. The main area of oil possibilities is in Northern Afghanistan in the region between Khanabad and Maimana, which forms part of the Turkoman Basin, which in Southern Uzbekistan contains the Termez oilfields situated north of the river Oxus, and another near Sar-i-Pul, 65 miles south-west of Balkh and about the same distance north-east of Maimana, Both these areas, were not far from producing fields in the Shirabad region in Soviet Central Asia, on the further (north) side of the Oxus, The Afghan Government refused to allow the company to put down test wells in this northern territory. The company also examined the Tirpul area, which was found to be disappointing, and it started to survey some districts further to the south, but the Afghan officials prevented it from carrying out a thorough examination.128# Owing to this obstructiveness and to the remoteness of the more promising regions examined, the Inland Exploration Company abandoned its concession in June 193&amp;« 129# In July 1948 the Afghan Government considered a proposal to form a company to explore the Tirpul area and others in Mazar-i-Sharif and Kataghan. A french oil expert was invited to conduct a survey but nothing has since been learnt of any subsequent progress* XXV. U.S.S.R. 130* Although geologically (and politically) the oilfields of the Eoviot Union around the Caspian Sea are quite separate from those already considered, they lie within the geographical area of the Middle East. 131* The most important fields in the Soviet Union are those of the Caucasus; in 1940 86 per cent of total Soviet production for about 27 million tons came from the fields at Baku, Grozny and Maikop. In 1950 it is planned that only 62 per cent (or some 22 million tons) will come from this area. Nevertheless the Caucasus and in particular the Baku field will constitute the Soviet Union*s main source of supply for some years to come. Production from these fields is estimated to be as follows (in millions of metric tons) • Field 19U0 12k5 12 k 6 12 kZ 1950 (Plan) Baku 22.0 11 .3 12.3 13.8 14.3 17.0 Grozny 2.0 0.7 1 .02 1.39 1 .63 2.0 Maikop 2.8 0.9 1 .2 1*5 1.9 2.25 Dagestan 0.30 0.35 0.32 0.55 0.60 Georgia 0.06 0.03 0.03 0.07 0.08 0.11 Emba 0.70 0.70 0.76 0.80 0.95 o CM • Turkmenia 0.56 0.60 0.65 0.89 1 .10 1 .10 (i) Baku 132# The Azerbaidzan oil fields, although not reached by German invasion were disastrously affected by the war: transpat out from Baku was severely cut and when local storage (even to the extent of flooding blocked gallies and pits in the ground with surplus oil) was full wells simply had to be shut-in. Shut-in wells could, however, have been reopened and there were deeper factors making for a decline in productivity. New drilling not only practicallycoaoed during the war, but had been declining in the preceding years. In 1936, 1,320 wells/MfolJLs had been put into operation; in 1938 only 910; in ^ 1939 373; and in the first 3 months of the following year a mere 72* Baku is heavily dependent on new wells of less than one year in age for its volume of produotion and, as in all oilfields, on new prospecting* The volume of now drilling and new prospecting was too low before the war, reduced to negligibility during the war, and since 1943# Qs is obvious from a steady flow of criticism, well below the planned level* The field is certainly not exhausted but wells become exhausted (in the sixth or seventh year, a Baku well produces only one fifth of its initial output) and it is clear that the U*S*S.R* is meeting with great difficulties in restoring the level of production* With sufficient equipment and immense effort the target for 1950 (well below the prewar output) could be reached, and it is certain that the laggardly progress of Baku is causing the Soviet authorities grave concern* 133* A large proportion of Baku oil is refined in Baku* Some crude is piped to Batum for treatment there, while the rest is taken by sea to Makhach Kala whence it is sent partly by pipeline and partly by rail to Grozny for refining* Some of the kerosene refined at Baku is sent via pipeline to Batum* The remaining products are sent from Baku by rail or tanker* The Volga is an important tanker route. A pipeline from Astrakhan to Saratov was built during the war but has probably now been dismantled as Volga tankers are more economic* (ii) Grozny 134* The Grozny fields seemed at the outset to offer great possibilities and refineries of very large capacity were erected to treat the oil produced* It was at one time only slightly less important in the Soviet economy than Baku* In 1932, for example, Grozny produced 8,000,000 tons of oil but production fell off rapidly and in 1938 output was only 2,800,000 tons* In 1942 the Germans in their drive for Caucasus oil reached the fields, over-ran two of them (Malgobek and Voznessensk) and subjected the rest to bombardment. Production ceased, but energetic restoration when the Germans retreated brought output to about 1,300 tons per day by the end of 1943* Ttie current level of output is uncertain, but in December 1947 it was stated that the level of prewar output had been reached* This rate does not seem to have been maintained in 1948 but it seems probable that the workers of the field will fulfil their pledge to reach the 1930 level by the end of 1949# The 1950 plan is not, however, known, being included in the general total for the R*S*F*S f R* 135. The refineries at Grozny were damaged during the war, one of 660,000 tons and another of 227,000 tons annual output being completely destroyed. The Grozny Rostov-Trudovaya kerosene pipeline (667 miles) was wrecked during the war, but was restored to full operation by the end of 1943* A gas pipeline from Grozny to Gorki (73 kra.) was completed in 1947* (iii)/143/ ( 1 ii) Maikop O 136* Tho oilfioldc of tho Kuban in the Maikop-Krasnodar area were before the war among the most promising fields of the Soviet Union. The Germans occupied the field in 1942 and there is no doubt that with Soviet scorched earth, and German devastation in retreat, no field could have been more thoroughly destroyed. The Plan speaks generally of restoring the field to its prewar output by 1950 but it seems clear that this will only be in a general sense and actual putput will not attain the best prewar levels* 137. The oil is refined partly at Krasnodar and partly at Tuapse, to both of which there are pipelines. (iv) Dagestan 138. The Dagestan field was opened at Makhach Kala only after the war had started. Output began in June 1942 with one well of 150 tons daily production and by the end of 1943 the field was producing 600 tons per day. About 600,000 tons are to be produced in 1950, but as explained at the end of paragraph 124 , separate plan figures for those fields have not been published. 139. Oil is transported from the fields by rail and Caspian tanker from Makhach Kala. A refinery is reported to be under construction at the field. (v) Georgia 140. Oil was produced in Georgia in small quantities before tho war. The Georgian Oil Trust, Gruzneft, is of cours to be distinguished from Grozneft, the Grozny oil trust. So far, prospecting and exploratory drilling is- the principal task, but fields at Norio, Gromi, Supsa, Kayt'es-Khev and Mirzaani are in production and the Plan lays down the 1950 target as 110,000 tons. 141# Tho crude is refined at Lilo near Tbilisi and the products are-consumed within the Georgian S.S.R. (vi) Emba 142. The oilfields in the Emba-Dossor area lie in the desert area at the north east end of the Caspian. An outlying field at Aktyubinsk is geologically part of it, but is organised as a separate Trust. Production at Emba rose from 247&gt;000 tons in 1932 to 697,000 tons in 1940 and an intensive campaign on the outbreak of war, raised output in 1943 to 1,000,000-tons. There was p rapid fall-off in exploitation when the North Caucasian fields could be again used, and 1945 output was some 700,000 tons. The Five-Year Plan lays down renewed expansion and 1950 output is to be 1 , 200,000 tons.143• A cracking plant of crude oil charge capacity of 10,000 barrels per day, delivered from the U.S.A. under Lease Lend was erected at Gurev. Production from the oilfield is sent by barge across the Caspian to Sand Island at the mouth of the Ural River and thence by pipeline to Gurev. Crude is also sent by rail or pipeline to Orsk where both Emba and Caucasian oil is refined. The Orsk refinery of which some but not all the equipment was supplied under Lease Lend contains cracking and alkylation units, (vii) Turkmenia (Trans-Caspia ) 144. The oilfields of the Turkmen S.S.R, are concentrated near Krasnovodsk at Nebit-Dag, 578,000 tons were produced in 1 940 and production was boosted during the war years to 650,000 tons (1943). A pledge was made to reach the 1950 level of production ( 1 , 104*000 tons) within 3 years, and output has been expanding at such a rate that it is probable this has been reached, 145. A U.S, Lease Lend refinery was erected at Krasnovodsk. The capacity is the same as that at Gurev and as crude production has exceeded this the surplus is shipped across the Caspian by tanker* 16th July, 1949 Economic Intelligence Department, Foreign Office.mu u, m A A m ( !®5? 0CUMENT 13 TH? 4 'PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVIJRNMENT) • SECRET M,E.

MATTERS ARISING FROM PREVIOUS MINUTES V Conference of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East (Previous Reference; M.E. (o)(49) 3nd Meeting, Minute 3 ) THE CHAIRMAN said that the date of the Conference of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East had been advanced owing to the engagements of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the economic subjects would be discussed on Friday, 22nd July. MR. YOUNG said that there was now some doubt whether the Treasury representative in the Middle East, who had been summoned home for the Conference, would arrive in time. THE CHAIRMAN said that it was proposed that the first report on Economic and Social development in the Middle East (M.E. (o)(49) 14) - together with the Interim Report on the same subject (M.E. (o)(49) 22 (Revise)), should be used at the Conference as briefs. The Committee;- Took note of the position. 2. PRESIDENT TRUMAN 1 S FOURTH POINT THE CHAIRMAN drew the attention of the Committee to a note circulated to the Official Committee on Economic Development (overseas) containing the text of President Truma^ message of the 24th June to the House of Representatives on Technical Assistance and Capital Investment in Underdeveloped Areas (E.D. (0. S. )(49) 17). He suggested that the note was of interest to all members of the Committee. As it was possible that some of them would not have seen it, arrangements could be made for the note to be circulated to the Committee. The Committee then considered whether the Working Party should be invited to study President Truman 1 s message and to report what special bearing it might have on Middle East problems. It was agreed, however, that, as it was not known what action was being taken in the general context of the message, further enquiries were desirable before research was made into its application to a particular area. The Committee (1) Invited the Secretariat to arrange for copies of E.D.(O.D. )(49) 1? to be circulated to members of the Committee. (2) Invited the Treasury, in conjunction v/ith the Economic Relations Department of the Foreign Office, to enquire into the position regarding President Truman 1 s message and to inform the Chairman of the Working Party accordingly.■w»i. mB'iu ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST '(INTERIM REPORT ) (Previous Reference: M«E.(0)(49) 3rd Meeting, Minute 2 ) The Committee considerod the Interim Report on Economic and Social Development in the Middle East (M#E.(0)(49) 22 (Revise)) which had been revised by the Working Party since the Committee’s previous meeting. MR, EVANS, speaking as Chairman of the Working Party, said that Annex A had been sub-divided into A(i) and A(ii), the first including projects the early execution of which should be encouraged, and the second including long-term projects which required further investigation. In redrafting the Annex the need for phasing and timing of the projects in each country had been borne in mind and paragraph 13 had been expanded to include references both to the urgency of economic problems in the Middle East and to the need for caution against over-hasty action. In the course of discussion doubts were expressed whether the reasons for submitting the report in its present interim form and for the choice of the countries so far studied were sufficiently clearly explained. If, as was suggested, the urgency of the refugee programme was the main reason for producing an Interim Report, it would not be apparent v/hy attention was paid at this stage to Egypt and, in particular, the long-term Nile Waters scheme. In^any case the Interim Report was based on the country studies and if it were submitted to the E.D.(O.S,) Committee as it stood, the necessary background would be lacking. TEE CHAIRMAN explained that there were inter alia political reasons (namely the forthcoming Egyptian elections) for requiring an early review of Egypt. This, and similar considerations, could be included either in the Report or in a covering note. It was also possible that the Conference of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East might have views on the Report. It was agreed that, when submitted to the^ E.D. (0. S.) Committee, the Interm Report should be ^ accompanied by a note explaining the reasons for its preparation in the present form, recapitulating in a few sentences the^ outstanding points of the country studies to which it referred and including any comments which the conference of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East might offer. The Committee (1) Invited the Working Party to draft a covering note to M.E.(0)(49) 22 (Revise)) on the lines discussed. The Committee then proceeded to consider M.E. (0)(49) 22 (Revise) paragraph by paragraph and agreed a number of further amendments, of which the following were the most important (a) Paragraph 2 It was explained that the word ’’examination’' in line 13 referred to the major considerations of available resources etc. , and not only to the technical examination of a scheme. It was therefore agreed to insert after the word ’’examination” the following words:- ”in the light of the internal resources of the country concerned”. - 2 -(b) Paragraph 3 (b)(i) It was agreed to delete the first sentence and to substitute; 'The proposed development should be one that was liKely to be and to remain an economic proposition but unlikely to be carried out without official assistance or impulsion*' (c) Paragraph It v/as agreed to delete in line 13 the words H their share (d) Paragraph 11(b) It was agreed that the reference to a specific series of un ? ece ? sa ry and that the passage from 'from the' (line 5) to 'contractors' (line 7 ) should be deleted and the competition' bStltUted; ' in the faCe ° f exlstin S or increasing £ 2 £ ex A (I): Egypt - project No. 1 (Nile Waters Pro.ie c p^°o + o r 4-^ 0 r ?? ove possible false impression about the the d f-ct T hG a0 hemes as soon as possible (in spite of the fact that the Jonglei canal scheme would take 20 years) it was agreed to expand the words in column 2 as follows- as soon as possible and as part of a phased and coherent programme'.

The figure suggested wa* £6 million covering 2 or 3 years. (J) Annex B . . £ s f nn ° x B was drawn up before the sub-division of Annex A I -,f n 5 :I:I, lt was a sreed that a similar breakdown of Annex B should be carried out.« (k) Annex C It was agreed that Annex C should be revised to include only projects in Annex A(l). The table could then be revised to show against each year the internal and external estimated expenditure of each country, together with the otals for the five countries. It would not be possible to make this revision before the Interim Report was circulated to the Conference of H. M. Representatives. The Committee:- (2) Invited the Working party to revise Annexes B and C on the lines agreed, for incorporation in the Report when submitted to the E.D. ( 0 . S. ) Committee. (l) Annex D It was agreed that Annex D should be detached from the Interim Report but retained for reference. The Committee:- (3) Invited the Working Party to incorporate in M.E.

Representatives in the Middle East on 21st and 22nd July. (3) Invited the Chairman, subject to any comments received from the Conference, to submit M.E. (o)(49) 22 (Revise) as amended and under cover of a note as agreed in Conclusion (1) above, to the Official Committee on Economic Development (Overseas). 4. FURTHER STUDIES BY THE WORKING- PARTY MR. EVANS said that the Working Party was proceeding with a^paper on technical experts and it would have to be decided whether or not the Committee needed to consider this paper when completed. As regards the country studies, the paper on the Lebanon would shortly be circulated for information; further papers were in hand on Saudi Arabia and the ex-Italian colonies. In reply to a question regarding the Sudan, THE CHAIRMAN said that he would have an opportunity of consultation with the Governor of the Sudan and would report to the Committee later on the need for producing a study of that country.

United Kingdom Government are strongly opposed to use of force by one Middle East country against another, but would not wish to oppose organic growth of greater unity with consent of the peoples concerned, between two or more Arab states. It was considered that United Kingdom Government should have normal ‘ friendly relations with Israel and that there was no reason why establishment of those relations should conflict with their long standing friendly relations with Arab states, some of which are embodied in treaties ol alliance and all of which should be maintained and if possible improved. discussions of defence matters there was general agreement that the organisation of an ovorall defence system for Middle ■ East should continue to be regarded as a most important British interest. 5.

Indivilial Papers on Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Transjordan (M.B.(0)(49) 15*17,19 and 20 respectively) have since been prepared as a background and detailed justification of whatever specific recom mendations it might be decided to put forward. A Paper on the Lebanon (M.E.(0)(49)21) will be circulated shortly. These countries (apart from Egypt which is important because of the Nile Waters Projects) were chosen as the most urgent in view of their particular relevance to the resettlement of refugees. Other country studies are being prepared: Persia, whose development plans are farther advanced than those of any other Middle Bast country but are less dependent^ut this stage, on ey.tornal assistance; the Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, where scope for development other than of oil is limited but whose vast earnings from oil raise most difficult problems and interesting possibilities the former Italian Colonies, where at present the average annual cost to fils Majesty’s Government in respect of administration expenses and budgetary deficits approaches £lv million; Ethiopia, whose development possibilities may be considerable but whose administration is amongst the least progressive in the middle East; and the Yemen, the most primitive of the Arab States.. ^ - 2 - 2 * The object &gt;£ this Paper .-The object of this Paper is to .ounr^irise the large amount of detailed information- now. available and to roc one.-end the practical application of the agreed principles in the light of the most urgent actual requirements and of the best estimate it is possible to-make of the cost and timing of selected projects. The questions to be decided are, first, what arc the best projects to encourage and, secondly, in v/hat ways His ivia jesty * s Government can help. We cannot ourselves make a final selection of projects for execution since such a large proportion of the necessary resources are outside our control. But we can decide in our own minds which of the projects seem most likely to repay the further examination which will be necessary before they can be put .up.as fully considered schemes for assistance from the International Bank, United States Government, His Majesty’s Government or other governments, with a view to putting them into early operation. 3* In .selecting projects for inclusion in the nrogramme of development referred to below (paragraph 4 ) the Committ-,-. has been guided by the following objectives and criteria (hot necessarily in order of priority)' (a) Objectives , (i),. To promote those types of economic activity, whether primary or industrial, in which the countries concerned are best fitted to engage, having regard to the balance of their economies and the advantage of external trade; (ii) To raise living standards as rapidly as levels of productivity permit; Ik ■ (iii) To secure the maximum mutual, advantage of the United Kingdom and the Middle Hast, having regard to any assistance, material or technical, which' the United Kingdom may be able to provide; (iv) To build up .the capital equipment of the Mid le East countries so as to provide a firm basis for future development. /(o(b) Criteria (ij The proposed development should 'bo an economic preposition and will continue to be but likely to require official assistance or impulsion. Xt should be borne in mind that private development of desirable industry (for which special assistance will not bo necessary) is also possible, furthermore social development which is essential for balanced progress should also be provided for. (ii) In present circumstances those projects which promise early results are to be preferred, in particular those which assist in providing an early solution to the problem of refugee resettlement. The Committee does not feel that the resettlement of Arab refugees should bo considered as an entirely separate matter, as many schemes which accord with the above objectives and criteria should r.ssist in solving this problem. Indeed, schemes which are economically the soundest are those best suited to meet it and to furnish a permanent and ultimately self-supporting solution, independent of further international aid. 4♦ Description of Annexes Annexed to this Paper arc; A. land II A list of selected projects v;ith;a short description of.the benefits to be derived from some of them and with a rough approximation of the cost and of the time required for execution. B. Extracted from (A) a list of the total internal and external expenditure of the five countries concerned. C. A more detailed analysis of (B) showing the internal and external expenditure of each country in each year from 1950-1935 and a global figure for the remaining yeare under consideration.-4- D. Rough estimates of the material required Tsy each country. 5- Attitude of Local Governments tP' Middle East Governments have of recent years tended to show more interest in internal development ar.d have already made some progress,, although their ideas on relative priorities are not always in accord with the objections referred to above. The acceptance by Middle East Governments of the programme out lined above, as it stands, may therefore require in sorre cases a considerable reorientation of their present views, which tend to favour rather more sophisticated projects. We consider that the programme set our in Annex A represents the most that can reason ably be achieved and digested by the economies of these countries having regard to the limitations of finance, labour and materials, and after taking as full account as v;e arc able of their share of any outside assistance that they can reasonably expect to receive from the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Bank and any other source. Moreover, should it turn out that we have underestimated the available resources, v;o * consider that anything additional should be applied so as to effect the speedier completion of the programme outlined rathor than to extend that'programme. It is therefore as important to discourage “bad” projects as to encourage n good iS ones. This does not mean that we regard the projects listed as exhaustive cr that any fresh project which may be put forward and which could be shown to satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 3 (b) above should be resisted. It is at the stage when assistance? is being offered, either by ourselves or the United States, that the best opportunity presents itself of securing those objectives which we consider to be the most desirable, by attaching reasonable conditions to the grant of such aid. If wo do not resolve to tackle this admittedly knotty problem now, the opportunity may well be lost. 6 . Total cost It is emphasised that the figures for the cost of the pro jects listed and for the length of time involved axe io most cases extremely rough e stimates since hardly any actual plans yet exist /Subject3 ./ ri. - 5 - Subject to those reservations the total estimated cost of the projects set out in the annexes is. roughly .^222,000,000. thi s about £120,000,000 may be for external expenditure on services and material, including at least # 60 , 000,000 (or about £15,000,000 sterling) in respect of material at present only available in the U.S. The remaining £100,000,000 would be for internal expenditure. 7. General Benefits of the p ro j ap.t^ .• The studies undertaken cover in most cases the period 1950-60 and. show that there are possibilities for development which if carried out successfully would produce, among other things the following results (a) General strengthening of the economies of the c/ur1 1 1 5 o concerned. (b) Control of. the, disastrous river floods in Iraq, which cost on an average about £1 million a year and cause large crop losses; and the lowering of flood risk ,in Kgypt. •. (c) Increased production of food, O-pg. in Iraq an annual increase qf 40,000 to 50,000 tons of rice, between 700,000 and 800,000 tons of whoat and barley and possibly, quantities of oil seeds and cotton; in Syria an increase of up to 200,000 tons of cereals, mostly wheat?, and also possibly quantities of oil seeds pulses and cotton; in the Lebanon and Transjordan increased quantities of fruit and vegetables in Egypt the increased produce of between 1 and ly million acres of intensively cultivated land and smaller increases from the pump irrigation schemes in the basins. (d) A valuable contribution to the solution of the Palestine refugee.problem e.g. in Syria and Transjordan and possibly, but less probably, in Iraq.- 6 - 8 « Tho projects will need to bo accompanied by the • appropriate and in many cases far reaching measures of social and fiscal reform to ensure that the resultant increase in the national v/ealth is not confined to a, small class but goes to raise the general standard of living by permitting increased real wages and improved social services# It must be the task of His Majesty 1 s Representative and British experts attached to the to press for the necessary action, in this field by the governments concerned. Pull regard, must also, be paid.to the need for the development of private enterprise and of.suitable industrial (including managerial) * skill, 9• Availability of local resources. Many governments v/ill have difficulty in meeting the local expenditure involved^ for which,the.International Bank will normally not lend. To issue additional local currency for this, even if backing is provided from external loans, is directly inflationary, and it is most desirable that the local purchasing power required for intei*nal expenditure should bo obtained by taxation or local borrowing so as to withdraw equivalent local purchasing power from circulation. Only when this is clearly impossible, as in Transjordan at present, should the alternative of borrowing abroad for local expenditure be considered, o.g. for such pressing purposes as an immediate I)rojoct for refugee resettlement, and then with duo regard for the accompanying disadvantages and dangers of this course. (These may he lessened if the method of transferring the external currency borrowed into the local currency required is hy importing consumer goods and selling them locally; but the proc,ess is cumbersome and susceptible of abuse, and could seldom, if ever, be carried out on the very large scale on wfoich it has been suggested in certain countries). The only possible-7- possiblo exceptions are liJ:oly to be cases in which, o.tf. Transjordan, internal resources are self-evidently incapable of providinr* the necessary internal credit but nevertheless a development project is of yroat importance and urgency for refugee resettlement purposes or other urgent purposes that some external assistance must be extended even to the provision of internal finance. . .attitude of the U.S. Government and International Bank. We know that the U.S. Government are extremely anxious to take some conerota stop to assist in the resettlement of Arab refugees and to make a contribution cither under this heading or as part of the Fourth Point programme or as an independent operation to Middle East development generally, it is however, still quite uncertain what funds it will he x^ossible to obtain from Congress and for what particular purposes. Since American policy is still in so formative a stage on this subject, we have/ on thishave perhaps a good opportunity for influencing it in what we consider the right direction. The International Bank is alre^y showing interest in Egyptian and Iraqi projects. The Bank is also anxious to assist so far as it can with refugee resettlement but the difficulty here is that the Bank is normally precluded by its terms of reference from making loans which do not secure a commercial return. In certain cases where the Bank is unable to make a normal loan, we should consider the possibility (suggested by the late President of the Bank) of its doing so in return for guarantees by the U.S. Government and/or H.ivi. Government (see M.E.(o)(49) 10 of 26 th April ). 11 . Direct advantages to the U.K. (a) The completion of the agricultural schemes 'may add considerably to the available supplies of soft currency cereals and unoy. thus save dollars to the U.K, and the sterling area. For example, sterling area wheat from Australia which has been imported into the Middle East will tend to become available for other sterling area countries including the U.K. There should also be increased surpluses of Middle East barley for export to the sterling area countries, such as India and the U.K, (b) Development in thu Middle East should provide opportunities for expansion of British trade. Considerable imports of capital equipment will be required and most of the large contracts for development works will have to be placed overseas. It is clear however from the relatively very small part of the Aswan Dam electrification schemes which have been allotted to British contractors that a special effort will have to be made if we are to gain the share of this market which would be desirable. (We should also bear in mind that if contracts go to United States firms the dollar cost will in many cases directly or indirectly fall on the U.K.). The raising of the general standard of living in the Middle East should offer further op portunities/(iii)/ ««• opportunities for increasing the Scilo of British consumer goods# /&gt; * 2• H#M#G. and the Four-th Point. The implementation of the Fourth Point by the United btates will involve them in contributions both to the United Nations and bilaterally. The President has already ashed Congress for ^ 45 million, the distribution as between the United Nations and bilateral arrangements to be left to the President’s discretion. As far as the U.K. is concerned, apart from any specific contribution which we may make to the United Nations effort, the financial, material and technical resources which we make available to British overseas territories will undoubtedly form a major part of our general contribution to the cause of economic development. We will, in addition, certainly be expected to make further bilateral contributions, particularly in an area such as the Middle East with which we are so closely associated, and it will moreover be in our commercial as well as our political interests to do so. The means of contribution open to us are:- (a) Technical, which may be of the following types - (i ) 1 The appointment of British officials to key posts in Middle East administrations. (In certain exceptional cases of particular importance where the csultJ?ire's offered by the Government concerned are not high enough to attract the right man, it may be necessary to consider subsidies from British official funds. The Corami'lgtoc ch'us not ho-wover fully examined this problem* (A separate-paper is being prepared). (ii) The strengthening of the permanent and temporary staff of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O.- 10 - (iii) Incroeisins the facilities for Middle Bast technicians to undergo technical training in the U.K. and the Middle Bast, (h) Financial and material ^ The very occasional yrant of direct loans as in the case of the €1 million loan to Transjordan, Support for applications for loans from the International Bank to member Governments and participation in such loans where appropriate. Approval for the raising of loans in the City of London by Middle East administrations. The release of sterling balances. (This must of course be considered in the context of our general policy governing sterling releases). Assistance in the procurement of materials and equipment in short supply, 1 3 * Conclusions an cl Roc omrncnda t i on s. The pressing urgency of the economic problems of the Middle East will be apparent from the main points emerging from the country studies already referred to in the introduction to this paper. For the sake of conciseness, we have not attempted to restate these problems at length, but this does not detract in any way from the great need to do all within our power to expedite developments on the lines set out briefly in this paper and its annexes. At the same time, there is need for a word of caution. -,ny attempt to tackle too much in too short a time could in fact result in a temporary depression in the standard of living from its present low level, perhaps for some years, would defeat our object. With adecur.te statistical information and more efficient administrations able to implement effectively the necessary economic and fiscal measures to support a period of substantial investment, it would be possible to assess more accurately the quantitative limit of investment activity which the economies of those countries could sustain without undue strain. But these circumstances do not/ (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v)- 11 - not exist. This seems to us to point to the need to proceed empirically* and not to attcrapt to make up our minds f db soon on desirable commencement dates or relative piiorities of* projects outside a short list* selected ooth because of their immediate attractions raid their lonp-tcrm benefits, (see Annex (l)). The mo-a sure of success attending the execution of these projects will serve as a useful indication of the ability of the countries concerned to proceed with other suitable schemes (Sec Annex ^ (II)). This does not moan that we should not bo ready to express views on the sort of schemes which dhculd follow* but merely tnnt we should for the time being reserve our opinion on timing. It is recommended that: (D (a) His Majesty’s Government should encourage and assist (or continue to encourage and assist) the governments concerned to put into execution as soon as possible (subject to any further investigations which may be necessary) the projects listed in Annex A (*). This list includes: (i) projects which detailed examination has shorn to be of intrinsic merit* and which in certain cases offer good prospects of an early return; (ii) projects which will provide for the resettlement of the Arab refugees; and (iii)projects which are of doubtful economic value* but on which work has already progressed so far that it v/ould bo wasteful to stop at this stage. It is recommended that where practicable these projects shall be revised. (b) His Majesty’s Government should encourage the Governments concerned to undertake without delay the detailed examination* necessary before a decision regarding their execution can be taken, of/of tho schomos listed in Annex A (ii) which preliminary surveys have indicated are lilcely to be economically sound. It should he accepted that this programme will involve the contribution by H.M.G, of certain limited technical, financial and material resources, but that the amount of this contribution cannot be accurately determined until it is known v/hat contributions are available from the United States, tho International Dank and other Sources and until international policy with reyard to the settlement of Arab refugees has been worked out in detail. Early discussion on tho basis of this programme should be held with the U.S. Government and the International Bank with a view to their accepting it as a concrete programme and making the greatest possible contributions to its implementation. Tho programme should also be used as a brief for discussion with the Middle East governments concerned and in particular with Middle East Development Boards as soon as these are set up in tho hope that they will also adopt this programme or something as like it as possible and will make the maximum contributions towards its implementation.a small mission of outside experts to revise the programmeft£—AJMSX D IRAQ YEAR MATERIAL AMOUNT OR VALUE 1950-60 Dam and irrigation construction material (sluices reinforcing material, etc.) 12,000 tons Contractors r plant 2,700 tons 1950-54 Railway material £ 1.25 million 1950-60 Cement 80,000 tons 1951-60 Agricultural equipment (a) £ 3-5 million or $14 million Road-making machines £ 0.5 million 1956-60 Bridge-making material 1,000 tons (NOT S (a): The amount and of tractors and which the Iraqi currency depend on the type agricultural implements Government will accept.).

Individual papers on Iraq, Syria, the Lebanon, Transjordan and Egypt have since been prepared as a background and detailed justification of whatever specific recommendations it might be decided to put forward. (ME(0)49 These countries were chosen as the most urgent xn view of their particular relevance to the resettlement of refugees. Other country studies will be prepared in due course. 2. The object of this paper The object of the present paper is to sift the large amount of detailed material now available and to recommend the practical application of the agreed principles in the light of the most urgent actual requirements and of the best estimate it is possible to make of the cost and timing of selected projects. The questions to be decided are firstly what are the best projects to encourage and secondly what contribution H.M.G. can and should make. H.M.G. cannot themselves make a final selection ot projec for execution since such a large proportion of the necessary resources are outside their control, but they can decide in their own minds what they consider to be a reasonable / programme/ (3) * - 2 - ' progranmG and then try to secure its adoption, and over and above their own contribution to obtain further assistance by the U«S.

Total cost. It is emphasised that the figures for the cost of the projects recommended and for the length of time involved are in most cases extremely rought estimates since hardly any actual plans yet exist. Subject to these reservations the total estimate cost of the projects set out in the annexes is roughly £222,000,000 spread over about ten years. Of this about £120,000,000 may be for external expenditure on services and material, including #70 ,000,000 for the purchase of material only available in the U.S. The remaining £100,000,000 v/ould be for internal expenditure. ... a 6. General Benefits of the projects. The studies undertaken cover in most cases the period 1950 - 60 and show that there are possibilities for development which if carried out successfully would afford the following results:-(a) General enrichment of all the countries concerned. (b) .Increased, production of food, e,g* in Iraq, an annual increase of 40 to 50#000 tons of rice# between 700 and 800#00Q tons of wheat and barley and possibly quantities of oil seeds and cotton; in Syria an increase of up to 200,000 tons of cereals# mostly wheat, and also possibly quantities of oil seeds pulses and cotton; in the Lebanon and Transjordan increased quantities of fruit and vegetables; in Egypt the increased produce of between 1 and li million acres of intensely cultivated land and smaller increases from the pump irrigation schemes in the basins. (c) Control of the disastrous fiver floods in Iraq which cost on an average about £1 million a year and cause large crop losses; and the lowering of flood risk in Egypt. (d) The, increase of village amenities in the Lebanon by the development of hydro-electric energy. (e) A valuable contribution to the solution of the Palestine refugee problem e.g. in Syria and Transjordan and possibly, but less probably, in Iraq. . . All the benefits represent the best possible, contribution that #an be made to the major task of combating the spi*ead of communism in the&gt; Middle East. They will need to be accompanied by the appropriate measures of social reform to ensure that new sources of wealth are not monopolized by a few rich or powerful men in each country. But provided this is done the development works will go a long way / towards- 5 - towards removing the conditions of material misery in which communist propaganda flourishes. 7• Attitude of local governments. The Middle East governments may well* have some other ideas about the relative priorities of their development projects 9 but no project has been included in the attached lists which could well tail to be given a very high priority by them. It is hoped that development boards will soon be set up in most of the countries concerned with whom we shall be able to discuss these projects in detail. The ability of the governments to find from their own resources the internal expenditure involved is likely to vary considerably. We are firmly attached to the principle that internal expenditure must be found internally. The only possible exceptions are lixely to be cases in which* e.g. Transjordan* internal resources are self-evidently incapable of providing the necessary internal credit* but nevertheless a development project is of such great importance and urgency for refugee resettlement purposes or other urgent purposes* that some external assistance must be extended even to the provision of internal finance. Such cases will be extremely rare. Attitude of the U.S. G overnment and In ternational Bank. We know that the U.S. Government are extremely anxious to take some concrete step to assist in the resettlement of Arab refugees and to make a contribution either under this heading or as part of the Fourth Point ‘programme or as an independent operation to Middle East development generally. It is however* still quite uncertain what funds it will be possible to obtain from Congress and for what particular purposes. Since American policy is still in so formative / a- 6 - a stage on this subject, we have perhaps a good opportunity for influencing it in what we consider the right direction. The International Bank is already showing interest in Egyptian and Iraqi projects. The Bank is also anxious to assist so far as it can v/ith refugee resettlement but the difficulty here is that the Bank is normally precluded by its terms of reference from making loans which do not secure a commercial return. In certain cases where the Bank is unable to make a normal loan, we should consider the possibility of its doing so in return for guarantees by the U.S. Government and/or H,M. Government. 9. Direct advantages to the U.K, External expenditure on these projects is a potential market for British trade. It is clear, however, from the relatively very small part of the Aswan Dam electrification schemes which have been allotted to British contractors, that a special effort will have to be made if we are to gain the share of this market which would be desirable. The completion of these schemes, most of which are intended to increase agricultural productivity, will mean, inter alia, that sterling area wheat from Australia which has been imported into the Middle East will be available for the U.K. The raising of the general standard of living in the ' Middle East should offer further opportunities for increasing the sale of British consumer goods. 10. H,M.G, and the Fourth Point. His Majesty’s Government have announced their intention in principle to contribute from their resources to the programme of technical assistance to under-developed countries recently put forward by President Truman and known as the / 'Fourth/ (V) - 7 - ’'Fourth Point Programme'• A great part of our contribution will 'be the financial, material and technical resources which we make available to British overseas territories. But we shall certainly he expected to make further contributions, particularly in an area such as the Middle East with which we are so closely associated. The means of contribution open to us are ~ (a) Technical, v/hich may be of the following types - (i) The appointment of British officials to key posts in Middle East administrations. (In certain exceptional cases of particular importance where the conditions offered by the Government concerned are not high enough to attract the right man, it may be necessary to consider subsidies from British official funds.) (ii) The strengthening of the permanent and temporary staff of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O. (in) Increasing the facilities for Middle East technicians to undergo technical training in the U.K. and the Middle East. (b) Financial and material T i • 1 * . (1) The very occasional grant of direct loans as in the case of the £1 million loan to Transjordan. (ii) Guarantees for loans from the International Bank to certain countries by H.M«G. and the U.S. Government either singly or jointly. (iii) Approval for the raising of loans in the Gity of London by Middle East administrations. (iv) The release of sterling balances and the allocation of extra convertible sterling.(V) The release of material in short supply. (vi) The granting of credit terms for the supply of material.The total programme which has been drawn up cost I.,D 0 ■14. 5 million over 10 years.TRANSJORDAN AMEX D IRAQ ; .

MATTERS AKISING FROM PREVIOUS MINUTES {.Pr evious Re ference: M &gt; E, (0 ) (U9 ) 2nd Meeting. Item l) THE OHAIRMAIM said, that the Report on Economic and uocial Development in the Middle East (M.E.(o)(49) 14) had been re-circulated to the Official Committee on Economic Development (Overseas) as E.D.(0.3.)(49) 7. It had been agreed with the Chairman of that Committee that if no observations were forthcoming from Departments, the paper could be presumed to be approved by them. No such observations had in fact been received. The Committee Took note accordingly. 2 . ECONOMIC and social development in the middle east (INTERIM REPOjRTT “ The Committee considered an Interim Report by the Working Party on Economic and Social Development in the Middle Eas-t (M.E.(0)(49) 22). MR. MAITLAND, speaking as Chairman of the Working Party saia that although the Country Studies had not all been completed, it had been decided to prepare an Interim Report summarising the Working Party’s general conclusions. The Country Studies which had so far appeare (.M.E. (0)(49) 19), Syria (M.E # (C)(49J l?) and Greater Transjordan (M.E.(0)(49) 20) on the Lebanon was in preparation. THE CHAIRMAN said that there were two reasons for the urgency in producing an Interim Report. Firstly, the existing sums for United Nations relief for refugees in the Middle East would have been spent by September or October next, and it would oe necessary for the United Nations Assembly to consider making further provision before that date. The prospects of obtaining adequate sums for resettlement purposes would be greater if it could be shown that positive schemes v/ere already in view. Secondly, there was to be a conference of H.M._Representatives in the Middle East on 26th^ to 29th July in London, and it was desired to present an outline of the problems to be tackled to that conference. It was therefore proposed that the Interim Report, after approval by the Committee, should be submitted to the Official Committee on Economic Development (Overseas) in time to secure their comments before the conference. d were those on Iraq , Egypt (M.E.(0)(49)19) . A parallel paper In the discussion doubts v/ere expressed whether in the present state of investigation it was possible to make firm recommendations regarding the projects and it was emphasised that any imijlicaticn of a financial commitment by His Majesty’s Government should be avoided. Doubt was also expressed regarding the scale of the schemes listed (the cost of which it was estimated would be £220 million) and also the period of time (10 years) suggested for their implementation. It was pointed out that in one country seven major projects would be in operation concurrently. Further points which emerged were the importance of distinguishing between the part t- be played by private enterpri and by government action in any development plans, the. need for balanced agricultural and industrial - 1 -development, and the importance of social reform. In connection with_the latter point, it was suggested that large-scale capital development was unlikely to have an immediate effect on the raising of the standard of living. It was also suggested that hefore a final selection of recommended projects could he made, further study of the economies of the countries concerned with a view to estimating the extent to which they would he ahle to a.inance the schemes would be necessary. It was recognised that the amount of information available on such subjects as internal investment, the budgetary position, national income and the pattern of trade varied as between countries and that it was in most cases inadequate, in particular as regards National Income; H,M, Missions would, however, be able to throw further light on to this problem. It was agreed that the schemes listed in the Annexes to the Interim Report were not to be taken as a correlated programme and that the total cost as calculated by the Working Party was only a tentative figure. The Working Party had sifted the available material and had selected the projects which subject to detailed study appeared suitable for early execution, but had not attempted a definite order of priority either as between different schemes or different countries. They had thus listed schemes already begun but not in every case of high priority side by side vrlth urgent projects for refugee resettlement, and various other less urgent but equally sound development schemes. There was scope for further research in this connection, particularly in regard to phasing and timing before the Report and Annexes could be approved. The Committee then considered M,E.(0)(49) 22 paragraph by paragraph, and agreed on a number of drafting amendments, of which the following were the most important:- (a) Parayranh 2 : It was agreed to substitute 'in what way His Majesty*s Government can help” for the words: 'what contribution His Majesty*s Government can and should make', and to replace the passage from 'what we consider' to the end of the paragraph by the following: 'which of the projects seem most likely to repay the further examination which will be necessary before they can be put up as fully considered schemes for assistance from the International Bank, United States Government, His Majesty’s Government or other governments, with a view to putting them into early operation.' (b) Pararraph 3 : It was agreed to insert, after the words 'Objectives' and 'Criteria', the following: '(not necessarily in order of priority)'. It was also agreed that a distinction should be drawn between official assistance and private enterprise in the economic field by adding after (b)(i) the words 'but is likely to require official assistance or impulsion'. The following reference to the need for balancing private enterprise against public works and social welfare against economic development should also be added: 'It should be borne in mind that private development of desirable industry (for which special assistance will not be necessary) is also possible. Furthermore social development which is essential for balanced progress should also bo provided for.' - 2 -—3— ■balanced progress, should also he provided for* (c) Paras;raT/h 6 : It was agreed to modify the text to ^ indicate that the estimate of ^60 million for U.S. material V was estimated on present availabilities and prices and that the figure was not necessarily the maximum. (d) Paraararli 6 : As the present proposals would have only an indirect effect in combating Communism in the Middle East, it was agreed to delete the first sentence. As health and welfare matters were not dealt with specifically in the memorandum (though they were in the relative Country Studies), it was agreed to include a reference to the task of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East and of the British Middle East Office of pressing for progress in this field. In addition, a sentence on the encouragement of private enterprise and the development of local managerial skill was required. The following text was agreed: 'It must be the task of H.M. Representatives and British exports attached to B.M.E.O. to press for the necessary action in this field by the Governments concerned. Pull regard must also be paid to the need for the development of private enterprise and of suitable industrial ( including managerial) skill.' (e) Paragraph 9 : It was agreed that the first sentence on internal financing was ambiguous, and should be redrafted by the Treasury. (f) Paragraph 12(a)(l) : It was agreed to modify the passage within parentheses to indicate that the Committee had not yet considered the matter of salaries for experts but would submit their views at a later date, (g) Parap;raph 15(1) (Recommondations ) : It was agreed that the form of recommendation to bo made regarding the list of projects would be reconsidered at the next meeting of the Committee, after the re-examination of the Annexes by the Working Party, The Commit toe:- (1) Invited the Working Party to revise M.E, (0) (49) b,? on the lines agreed in discussion, incorporating a redraft of paragraph 9 to be prepared by the Treasury. (2) Invited the Working Party to re-examine the Annexes to M.E.(0)(49)22 in the light of the above discussion. (3) Agreed to meet again on Tuesday, 19th July, at 3.30 p.m., to finalise M.E.(0)(49)22 and its Annexes. l X ! 3. CONFERENCE OF H.M. REPRESENTATIVES IN THE MIDDLE EAST The Committee considered a proposed timetable and agenda for tho Conference in London from 2Gth to 2.91 h July , inclusive, of H.M. Representatives in the Middle East (MTE.Xo) (49)23). THE CHAIRMAN said that members of the Committee might wish to consider at which particular meetings of the Conference their Departments would like to bo represented, and to inform the Middle East Secretariat of the Foreign Office accordingly.MR. M 0 NS ELL-DAYIES said that the Ministry of Fuel and Power were anxious that the question of Oil Policy, which was down for the morning of 27th July, should he transferred to the afternoon of that day. It was agreed that Items (e) and (g) should he taken as arranged in the morning of 27th July, and that Oil Policy (item (#■)) should he taken with Arah Refugees (Item (h)) in the afternoon. The Committoe:~ Took note of the position, and invited the attention of Departments to ! X r above* 4. OIIANG-F OF JOINT SECRETARY THE CHAIRMAN said that Mr# Maitland of the Foreign Office who^had acted as Joint Secretary of the Committee and^as Chairman of the Working Party under the Committee, would he returning that week to his post at Cairo, and would he succeeded by Mr. Trevor Evans. He thought the Committee would wish to thank Mr. Maitland on their behalf for the unremitting work which he had put in as Chairman of the Working Party, and to extend to him their good wishes. MR. MAITLAND said in reply that he had much appreciated the close collaboration and enthusiasm of the Departmental representatives on the V/orking Par ty. * The Committee:- Warmly endorsed t he C hairman * s remarks# Cabinet Office, S.W.l. 9TH JULY, 1949#d (a) ..MMBX B.

Cabinet Office, S.W.l. 27th June, 1949.Note “by the Chair m an of the Work i ng Party, 1, It was not possible, in the time available, for the Working Party to give as much thought as they would have wished to the Conclusions set out in paragraph P of the attached Paper. The Conclusions do not necessarily therefore represent the unanimous recommendations of the Working Party. 2• A separate Paper on the Nile Waters (paragraph D) is being prepared and will be circulated to the Committee in due course*A, INTRODUCTION *• Egypt s economic problem is that the extent to which production and exports can expand is limited and that the population is increasing very rapidly. Egypt is thus faced with the threat of a fall in the standard of living of the bulk of the people. This threat will aggravate the social problem which already exists. The vast majority of the people are poorj the rest possess great wealth. Egypt's social and economic problems are urgent and they must therefore be handled with the utmost vigour and imagination. This paper has three objects; first, to analyse the economic and social problems; second, to describe the progress which has already been made towards resolving them; third, to recommend what action His Majesty's Government should take towards the solution of these two problems. The measures for economic development and social reform which the Egyptian Government have adopted hitherto are quite inadequate, but there are indications that they have recognised the existence and diagnosed the nature of the two fundamental problems. The Egyptian Foreign Minister rocontly expressed to the Foreign Secretary Egypt's wish for British advice and assistance in drawing up comprehensive measures of economic and social reform- Khashaba Pasha was informed that H.il.G. would be happy to respond to the Egyptian Governments approach, and he was advised to get in touch with the Head of the British Middle East Office 0 It ia suggested that this paper be regarded as.the basis of Sir John Trout beck’s brief for his discussions with the Egyptian Government, B. THE ECONOMIC PR OBLEM 1. Population In 1947'the total population of Egypt was 19.01 millions. The increase in the population between 1937 and 1947 was 19.8$t compared with 12.1&gt;o between 1927 and 1937. The(i) The Egyptian birth rate (40 per 1000) is the highest in the world after the Palestinian, The death rate, over 26 per 1*p&gt; is the highest in the world. Infant mortality is high. The improvement of the health services will probably result in the lowering of the death rate, and the rate of population increase may therefore be expected to accelerate. The habitable area of Sgypt is already the most densely populated in the world. 2, Agriculture (a) General Agriculture is iigypt 1 s mainstay. It Is overwhelmingly the main source of employment. It provides most of the food requirements of the country and most of Egypt’s exports. Some 70&gt;3 of the population are engaged in agriculture. During the past 25 years the total cultivated areas has remained static at about 6 million acres but the total crop area has been increased to over 9 million acres as a result of the transition from the basin system of irrigation to perennial irrigation. ( b) Gro-ps The percentage of land cultivated under the main crops in 1935 and 1945 was as follows: Cotton 20.7 10.7 Maize 19.6 20.5 Whe at 17.5 b 18.0 Ben as 5.2 4.3 Rice 5.8 6.9 Others • 31.2 39.6 Cotton and wheat are the fellah’s main cash crops,- 4 - prices. Moreover, Egypt is now having to compete with the development of substitute fabrics such as rayon ^ and nylon. The Egyptian Government are aware that Bgypt ! s present excessive dependence on cotton exports should be reduced by expanding the production and export of other commodities and by reducing . imports, 3. Industry and Mining (a) General \ Industrial production in Egypt is mainly confined to ’ petroleum, f ood processing, textiles, tobacco, footwear, cement, supbr-phosphatos and 'suq” (or bazaar) industries producing goods for consumption by tourists. The expansion of industrial activity in Egypt, which began some twenty years ago, was intensified during the war. But some of the smaller concerns established then have either gone out of business or are finding difficulty in meeting the competition of imported goods. Owing to the high price of Egyptian cotton difficulties are arising in the textile industry, which now supplies a great proportion of the country’s requirements in medium and low-priced goods and has a certain surplus available for export. The larger concerns, such as those of the Misr groups, are however unlikely to be seriously affected. In the case of some of the recently established industries there has clearly been a lack of realistic planning in relation to the probable capacity of the market once the war-time scarcity of consumer goods had disappeared, (b) Position in 1948 Industrial production in 1948 was estimated at about £E 16? millions, or almost equivalent to the value of all imports from abroad in that year (which, incidentally, were five times the pre-war value). Capital invested in industry- 5 - industry and commerce is now about £E 125 millions with reserves of about ,£E 50 millions. The total number of employees of all grades in Egyptian industry including mining and housing is estimated to be only 750,000 or of the total population . (c) Petroleum The discovery of oil at Has Gharib and intensive development during the war resulted in a big expansion in the plodaction JI crl:i( i e oil* In 1938 under 250,000 tons were produced, in I 9 I 46 almost 1,300,000 tons. By 1946 the Suez refinery of Anglo-Egyptian oilfields and the Egyptian Governmant refinery was supplying (i) (il) all local requirements of household gas hll ^ J^t^ry .yhqufr'ements ■Qr-:o* tor Egypt. (iii) approximately of civilian kerosene requirements (Iv) about kOjo of civilian diesel fuel requirements (v) about 50/i of fuel oil requirements excluding bunkers (vi) all local asphalt requirements, plus an exportable surplus. There have been several comparatively promising new strikes of oil in the past year, but the expansion of refinery capacity by Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Limited (Shell) to exploit them to the utmost is held up by Government cbstructic over leases of land, and restrictive legislation. The Government's own refinery is to be extended, tenders having been invited for the supply of the necessary equipment. The Government have ruled that no crude oil is to be exported, but their restrictive legislation is discouraging the foreign companies who have found the oil from refining it in Egypt. (d) Iron ore /- 6 - Id) Iron ore. in 1937 iron ore deposits estimated at 1,00C million tons of high grade ore were discovered near Aswan* An international commission visited Egypt in February 1949 to study the economic possibility of utilising Aswan-generated electric power in smelting the ore with a view to economising coko. Another body of opinion within the Government favours normal blast furnace practice, with steelworks probably on the coast or at an existing port. Here again no detailed plans have been made, and the widely-advertised project may possibly be shelved. iff.). 0 ^her_ minerals. Some 500,000 tons of phosphates, 200,000 tons of low grade manganese and 200,000 tons of salt are produced annually. The utilisation of some of the power to be generated by the hydro-electric power station now being constructed at Aswan for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers has been contemplated for many years, and an international commission was asked m 1947 to report on the possibilities. The Government appears to have decided in principle that this scheme shall be realised, but no plans have been elaborated. Since the earliest date mentioned for the beginning of generation of power at Aswan is 1953, and full operation of the station will probably not begin before 1955, fertiliser production is an even more remote project. If), Industrial expansion., The expansion of Egyptian industry is limited by four factors: (i) Shortage of skilled labour and inefficient labour management (ii) Scarcity of raw materials (iii)- 7 - (lit) Hastrictivo legislation (e.g. the Companies Law, and the propDsed law prohibiting the acquisition of land by foreigners). (iv) A limited internal market, The limited domestic and neighbouring market may bo the crucial factor in the situation. Since at present the possibilities of export on any large scale outsicie this market is limited, the pace of industrialisation is set by the size of the existing market. As long as 3gypt has a semi-feudal rural economy there is little scope for a modern capitalist industry and few attractions for capital investment. As it is, the &amp;omeBtio does not even the ollentale of the rich, who prefer to buy foreign goods. C. THE SOCIAL PROBT.aM. 1. Individual Poverty and Individual Wealth The standard of living, measured by the quantity of commodities available for the mass of the population, is slowly declining. There is growing unemployment, latent if not apparent. With the constant increase of the rural population - some 70w to 8055 of the total - agriculture is being overloaded with a redundant labour force which, amounts to about l^Ojl of the rural population. The goal reward to agricultural labour is therefore continually falling. Prices of Egyptian agricultural produce have risen from three to four times since before the war. World prices of cereals have risen even higher, but the Egyptian Government limited the price of homo-grown cereals in an attempt to check the rise in the cost of living, which is now nearly three times as high as in 1939. Pam wages have risen 2* times. Rents too have risen. Thus, although the cash return to cultivators is higher than before the war, it has not, in general, kept pace with the rise in the cost of living, so that the rural /workers*workers real income has fallen and continues to fall. This process of progressive impoverishment of the rural population may be drastically increased.if world prices of cotton and cereals fall seriously. Alongside the majority of the population who are poor there is a small land-owing Pasha class, which is rich and lightly taxed. One third of the land in rural districts is owned by only of total registered landowners. 2. Unemployment In addition to latent unemployment there is real unemployment in Egypt, though less than might be expected. There is a residue from the ar years-'of casually employed' labour in the towns. The size of this floating mass of labour may increase as the depression in the textile indust intensifies. As the Egyptian workman is adept at making a * scant living from odd jobs, or living on his relatives, the number of wholly unemployed in the European sense is probably small. 3» Workers * Interests. Trade Unionism lags well behind developments in other countries. Law 85 of 1942 permits national unions of similar trades,.crafts and professions, but‘none has been allowed by the Government so fair-. ’ The Law 'prohibits a National Federation of Unions. Consequently there is no Central Committee representing the workers' interests with which the Government can consult. Latest statistics show that there are some 430 Unions with a total membership of nearly’100,000. One Union alone has about 22,000 members. The mass of small Unions provide excellent opportunities for Communist agitators to /secure-9- ^secure election to the ^.F.T.U. It is clear that a form L of constitutional T.U.C. could wield much influence among . the workers and counter the activities of the Communists# As far as any wage policy can be said to exist it is that wages should be raised by prosperous firms# No attempt is made to raise the standard of wages generally in small concerns or to improve the enforcement of existing labour legislation. There is no constructive work in the way of employment service, vocational guidance, training, rehabilitation or manpower planning# The Labour Department works almost entirely without statistics. 4# Land Tenure The distribution of In rid owners hip is unequal# Three-quarters of the U million persons actively occupied in agriculture do not own even os much os one acre. If the gross income from agriculture were to be equally distributed among the farm population, it would provide an annual gross income of £E8 per head or £E40 per family; if, that is to say, the land were equally distributed, it would be possible for the population to exist on a standard which, though very low, would yet be adequate in regard to food# With the increase in population, the class of .the small properties has increased* far more rapidly than ether classes. Most of this increase has been in farms of under one acre, which do not provide a minimum subsistence level# /Thus10 - Thus the increase of population has added to the number of landless or sub-landed peasants. a* Public Health RiMtos.'-HeaLthis cud of Egypt's most serious problems. The population is debilitated by endemic diseases. 75# of the population are chronically infected with bilharzia, 90# with trachoma. Malaria and hookworm are also prevalent. || Education In 1937&gt; over 81# of the total population were recorded as illiterate. Although the Constitution provides that education must be free and compulsory for all children between 7 and 12, the number of pupils in Government ' and Provincial Council elementary and primary schools in 1947 was only about 16# of the total population between the ages of 5 and 14 years.’ The education system suffers from a number of defects# For instance, the direction of the Government schools is over-centralised; there is a shortage of teachers and their standard is low; There is a disproportionate number of University students to the number of elementary school children and being ill-prepared the students cannot take advantage of the high standard of teaching at the Universities. P-a POSSIBILITIES FOR ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS. ^^./O^ian Five-Year Plan The only comprehensive development plan produced by the* Egyptian Government is the so-called Five-Year Plan, prepared in 1945 and approved in 1946. This plan is in fact little more than a list of classes of development work considered desirable or necessary, with some of the more important . individually mentioned. A total of £E96 millions was to be provided, £.E46 millions out of the General Reserve and the remainder out of current revenue in five equal- 11 - equal yearly instalments. It was left to the responsible Government Departments to draw up and execute plans for individual projects. It is difficult to assess ho far the plan has been implemented, br 1 ' a certain amount of progress is known to have been made. Circum stances such as expenditure on the Palestine campaign, the rise in prices of imported capital equipment, the emergence of other projects, and the cholera epidemic of IPU? have probably led to some modifica tion of the plan. Of the total sum of £.E46 millions to be provided out of the General Reserve £E22.45 millions was allocated in 1946 as follows:- (1) Roads £.E4 millions (2) Reclamation of swamp lands £.E2 millions (3) Cairo main drainage £.E2 millions (4) Schools and Hospitals (5) Irrigation and Drainage (6) Pure Drinking water supplies (7) Agricultural schemes (8) Other projects about Another sum of £,E7.8 millions was set aside out of the General Reserve in 1947. Out of current revenue £.E24 millions has been allocated for the three financial years 1946-7-8 and 1948-9; this is somewhat less than the annual sum of £.E10 millions to be provider from current revenue. 2. Eco nomic Advisory Council . It was announced recently that the Government had resuscitated the Higher Economic Advisory Council, to coordinate economic policy under the Minister of State. It is reported that the Council will consist 'of three members, each one being allowed to nominate two advisers, and that the Council will have executive as well as advisory powers. This is a v/elcome development but it remains to be seen whether the Council will in fact enjoy sufficient authority to carry out its duties effectively. 3. Agriculture. (a) Extension of the cu lti vable area. ( i) The Nile Waters Imaginative measures have been taken towards the extension of the /cultivable £.E1.5 millions £.E6 millions £.E3.25 millions £.E1.7 millions £.E2 millions. - 12 - , cultivable area. The Egyptian Government have committed themselves to the execution of the Equatorial Nile Project, the Lake Tana Project and the main Nile Project, which together will make the greatest single contribution to the development of Egyptian agriculture. It is calculated that these projects will add one million acres to the area at present under cultivation in Egypt, and will facilitate the raising of more crops on the land at present under basin irrigation. These projects, which represent the ultimate exploitation of the Nile Waters, may not be fully effective for 20 years. Xii) Other Projects A plan to bore tube wells in the basin-irrigated lands of the Qena and Aswan provinces of Upper Egypt has recently been evolved. The purpose is to tap underground resources of water and use it for perennial irrigation. The first stage (5 years) of the scheme provides for the installation over an area of 125,000 acres of 500 pumping units to be served by an electric power station at Qena. The second stage (also of 5 years) provides for the installation of 500 other units in a further 125,000 acres, to be served by the hydro-electric power station at Aswan. The present supplies of water at low Nile do not permit the conversion of this area, which extends to about 1 million acres, to perennial irrigation. Moreover, this conversion is not possible until full control of the Nile flood is secured by works further upstream, as the basins are a safety valve in years of high floods. The Egyptian Government hope to obtain a loan for this purpose from the International Bank. Their estimate of the cost of the Project is £E 8 millions, of which some £E 5 millions represents external expenditure. This estimate is probably exaggerated. Other schemes under consideration provide for: the- ~ the sinking of wells in the coastal belt of the western ^ desert; the irrigation of areas in the western desert by canals dag from the Nile* the tapping and control of sources of artesian and sub-artesian water in the oases ofl Kharga and Dakhla (the total area of those oases is roughly equal to the total cultivated area of 3gypt) and Farafra and Baharia, which would reclaim considerable areas if cultivators from the Nile Valley could be persuaded to emigrate there and if communications were improved# (b) Increase in productivity in the existing cultivated area* This can be achieved by:- (i) in a relatively small region - converting .Tl?™ —'basi n' Irrigation (the land being irrigated once a year^ when the Nile is in flood) to perennial irrigation* permitting more than one crop to be raised in a year# But the 'basins% which cover about 1 million acres, cannot be converted to perennial irrigation until complete flood control of the Nile further upstoam has been instituted. At the moment they represent a safety valve in years of high Nile. Xii) Increased use of fertilisers . Crop yields at present are below pre-war levels owing to the lack of fertilisers during the war. Before the war an average of about 500,000 tons of nitrates and superphosphates were imported annually at a cost of about £3 millions. The net increment due to the utilisation of fertilisers was estimated at £11-12 million per annum. A nitrogenous fertiliser factory now under construction at Suez (with a loan of 07 millions from the Import-Export Bank) will, when it goes into production in two or three years’ time, go a long way towards making the country independent ofof imports# Another factory, which will bo served by the electricity generated at tho dam is planned at Aswan, ihis project is unlikely to be in production for ten years. (iii) Mechanisation The possibilities of increasing productivity by this means are limited by the small slzo of the agricultural holdings. Mechanisation is also inhibited by the avail ibill by ot surplus labour for cultivation by the primitive but nevertheless relatively effective methods at present used. Moreover, statistics collected in 1937 indicate that gross returns are in fact highest on the small j- arui, and that the breaking up of large estates may therefore increase efficiency. 4* Industry and Trade# During the past four years, many new textile mills have been opened, and other-new enterprises include the manufacture of plastic wares, chemical fertilisers,oxygen and acetylene, metal working and founding. A large nitrogenous fertiliser factory and three small steel works are being built. Industrial production in 1948 was estimated at about £E 167 million, or almost equivalent to the value of all imports from abroad in that year. Capital invested in industry and commerce is now in the region of £E 125 million, with reserves of about £E 50 million. The contribution of this movement of industrialisation towards the problem of providing fuller employment is represented /by-15- ~ by the relatively modest figure of 459,000, the official estimate of the total number of employees of all grades in Egyptian industry. If mining and housing are included the figure is about 750 , 000 . The development of rural industries depends mainly on organisation, and the Government informed the PAO in February 1948., that the promotion of rural industries was included in their long-term plan for raising the standard of living of the fellah. Nothing however has materialised so far, apart from some interest shown by •the Government in encouraging rug and carpet making and hand-woven textiles. Egypt's foreign trade has shown a phenomenal expansion during the past two years. In 1938 total imports were £ 36.8 million and exports and re-exports £ 29*4 million. In 194? these had risen to £ 103»9 million and £ 86 million, while in 1948 the figures were £ 172.8 million and £ 140.7 million respectively. Although in the case of exports, prices account for most of the increase, there has been a substantial rise in the volume of the import trade. This is sustained by the very high prices of Egyptian cotton and by the expenditure of reserves and sterling balances accumulated during the war years. The' shortage of dollars among Egypt’s overseas customers has strengthened the demand for her cotton and a system of barter- deals favoured by the present Egyptian Government has so far enabled Egypt to dispose of her current production and much of her wartime stocks to advantage. In spite of Egypt’s need and desire for industrial expansion 'she has nevertheless had the wisdom to throw open her markets for all goods from sterling and transferable /area- 16 - area sources, and by the provision of ample supplies of consumer goods either from her own production or from imports she hopes to keep in check the strong inflationary tendency common to Middle East countries* Egypt’s consent to the continuance of an Open General Import Licence was an important feature of the Trade and Payments Agreement negotiated last March. A possible source of additional earnings lies in the tourist traffic which in the past has provided a valuable contribution to earnings of foreign currency. Egypt’s mild winter climate and her unrivalled treasures of a past civilisation have attracted, and always will attract, large numbers of visitors, and recent antiquarian discoveries will give a stimulus to her tourist trade when more settled internal conditions return and the present wave of xenophobia dies down. 5* Social Administration. (a) Rural (i) Land Reform Plans were drawn up some years ago by the Ministry of Social Affairs for the control of land rent by fixing a maximum which is quoted variously as 12,14 or 16 times the land-tax, and for fixing minimum agricultural wages at a subsistence level to be determined by local committees. These two plans are inter—dependent and are necessary to prevent the landowners from escaping the effects of reform by transferring the working of the land from tenants to themselves, or vice versa. It was announced at the beginning of April, 1949, that a Bill had. been prepared whose object was the reduction of land rents. /A-17- A further step in the same direction, though of limited . application owing to the relatively small total area of land available for distribution, aims at the creation of a class of land—owning peasants# A bill before the Senate provides that any state- owned agricultural land which has been reclaimed should not be sold co landowners, but should go in plots of 3 to 5 acres complete with a house either to landless fellahin or to landless diplomes of the agricultural schools with interest-free loans repayable over thirty-years to buy implements, seed and beasts. A distribution of 3000 acres in Gharbia on these lines was actually made in March 1948, allegedly as a result of King Farouk 1 s personal intervention. It can be accepted that this is now a firm item of Government policy, but any enthusiasm must be tempered by the fact that no land is being reclaimed in Upper Egypt. However, assurances have been given that land reclamation schemes have priority and that between 20,000 and 50,000 acres can be turned over each year. There is a danger that this measure, although genuine in conception, may be exaggerated for purposes of political propaganda. (ii) Rural Welfare. * Since 1945 there have been proposals to impose •ertain obligations on land—owners for the provision of social and health services for their workers and tenants. Legislation was promised in the Speech from the Throne in November 1947 but has not yet been passed. (ill) Water Sunnly A project for the supply of pure drinking water, of great importance from the point of view of improving / thethe health of the rural population, was forced into first place by the 1947 cholera epidemic. The sum oi £E 3i millions allocated for this purpose in 1946 will probably however prove inadequate* A contract was recently placed for the completion of one of the five large waterworks, with its network of mains, to be erected in the Delta, and tenders were due to be opened- for a second such project in the early part of 1949* In addition to these large schemes in the northern part of the Delta, pure water is being provided in other parts of the country from wells sunk in the villages and provided with powered pumping sets. About 2,000 of these will be required eventually, in addition to over 12,000 wells equipped with hand pumps. There should be no difficulty in meeting Egypt's requirements of pumps from the United Kingdom, but the present world supply of pipes is likely to hold up the realisation of this scheme* Nevertheless a responsible official in the Ministry of Public Health stated some months ago that the percentage of the rural population supplied with pure i drinking water had been raised in the last three years or so from to 40?b. H.M.G. has agreed to contribute £E2 millions out of the profits of the Anglo—Egyptian Ootton Buying GoiiimissixB of 1940-41 to the cost of the village drinking water scheme on condition that the Egyptian Government make equal contributions. The Egyptian Government has not yet asked for any of this money to be handed over. (b) Industrial (b Industrial Welfare There has been striking progress in this field recently but chiefly owing to the initiative of the /biggerbigger employers, some of whom have preferred to employ their profits in this way instead of having them taken in Excess Profits Tax. Employers are finding that it is generally in their own interest to provide welfare services which help to give them a more settled labour force. The G-overnment is attempting to encourage this movement, even to the extent of wishing to impose on employers services which shoi'11 be a government responsibility, e.g. housing, medical services, transport (ii) Trade Unions The only Government plans that exist are for the development of the welfare side of union activities;, the Ministry of Social Affairs hope to form a trade union advisory branch to help unions (whose officials are in many cases scarcely literate and know little of office procedure) in administration; dependent on this is a proposal for which finance has yet to be agreed that the Government should subsidise the unionr: in the provision of clinics, sickness benefit etc. There is some hope in this proposal if the right advisory staff can be found, but the way in which the present fund for rewarding efficient trade unions is administered does not encourage trade unionists to expect too much. (c) General (i) Social Insurance In January 1947 two I.L.O, experts drew up a scheme for pensions insurance and sickness benefit for industrial and commercial workers in the most highly developed areas in Egypt. The Government has continually promised to give effect to this scheme, and a final version of a bill was approved by the Higher Labour Council at the end of 1948, But the scheme has now for the time being been set aside by the Ministry of Social Affairs who are investigating~L0~ the possibility of a universal non-contributory pensions scheme paid from the national exchequer. The success of any such scheme is dependent on efficient administration, and before the I*L.O. project was shelved, arrangements had been made for four officials to go to the U.K. for training under the Ministry of National Insurance# (ii) C o-ope ration For three years the Government has had a plan for the creation of a co-operative bank. It has not yet been put into effect. Meanwhile it is proposed that the Agricultural Credit Bank should be expanded in order to finance co-operative societies# 6# Housing; A Workers f City is being built at Embabeh, a suburb of Cairo* It is planned to build 6,650 houses in all. Work started towards the end of 1947&gt; and about 600 houses have been completed, while a total of 1,000 will, it is hoped, be ready by October, 1949* The cost to date has been in the region of £E hi millions# The Ministry of Social Affairs has meanwhile drawn up a 10-year plan for the construction of 40,000 town dwellings •and 100,000 country dwellings annually at a cost of £E 16 millions. Under this plan the Government would raise the money by an internal loan at 2-g- to 3 per cent and make advances of up to two-thirds to any organisation prepared to build dwellings of the type required. Priority in the allocation of the town dwellings would go to families with incomes below £E 9 per month. There is little prospect of the programme being fully carried out since insufficient attention seems to have been paid to the availability of materials or labour or to the control of luxury building. It is satisfying however that housing has become a subject of public policy, and that the provision of finance, at any rate, is not to be allowed to handicap the programme# /?7 . -21- 7• Public Health The Ministry of Public Health's Annual Budget is now about ££12,000,000. It is larger than the Annual Budget of the Health Services of all other Middle East countries combined. The Ministry have a satisfactory programme of hospital construction which aims at providing a 500-bed general hospital for each province headquarters, a 100-bed hospital for each district headquarters, and one rural health centra for every 15,000 people. This programme is being steadily carried out, and an excellent hospital in Mansurah has already been completed. In addition there are hospitals for special diseases including one of the finest opthalmic diseases organisations in the world. There is no lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Ministry and no lack of finance. Every effort is being made to increase the number of doctor^ but the setting up of rural health centres tends to outstrip the supply of doctors to staff them. The Egyptian Authorities have realised for sone time that more doctors are required and within the last eight years have increased the -Faculties of Medicine in Egypt from one to three. This has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of doctors quqlifying every year. The number of doctors at present in Egypt is somewhere between 4,000 and 5,000 of whom between 1,500 and 2,000 are in the Ministry of Public Health. The number of doctors in Egypt is already far greater than that in all the other Middle Eastern countries combined, but the intention is to increase the number to about 8,000 as soon as possible. The defects of the hospital administration m Egypt at present are entirely due to unsatisfactory human relations and low ethical standards. Steps are being /taken- 22 — taken to remedy these failings as far as possible by increasing the number of British doctors teaching in the Faculties of Medicine and by reorganising the nursing services and increasing enormously the number of British Sisters. The Egyptian Authorities hav^l created over 90 vacancies for British Sisters and have recently engaged a British Nursing Adviser to reorganise and control their Nursing Services* The preventive health services are of a high standard and compare favourable with other comparable countries, particularly as regards child welfare and the prevention of endemic diseases. The Government plan to construct 1,200 village health centres throughout the country. About 80 of these had been constructed by the end of 1948 and 30 more were phnned for 1949, but several stand empty due to lack of doctors and nurses to run them. 84 Education. Considering the situation with which Egypt was faced when education passed over into Egyptian control in 1922, progress in the educational field has been rapid. From 1922 to 1947 the number of university students increased from 3,000 to over 21,000 1 hile secondary school pupils increased in numbers from 9,400 to 64^000. In addition there was a rapid expansion of female education, the number of schools increasing from 1 to 40, and of pupils from 30 to 12,000. At the same time technical and trade schools increased; they now provide for half as many students as go to secondary schools. A Peoples University was established by the Government in 1946, providing adult education, both literal and vocational by evening classes in 15 different centres. The University now caters for about 15,000 students. Infant schools increased from 2 to 154 from 1922 to 1947, and a school medical service was developed, which now provides, amongst other things, school-meals for over 1 million pupils at an annual cost of over £E 3 million. In the next 5-10 years the Government plans to spend £E 10 million on new schools. In 1920 the expenditure of the Ministry of -Education was 2.5 per cent of the total national expenditure. In 1948 it was 15 per cent.E. EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT ^• External financial assistcince The Nile Waters schemes referred to in paragraph D above will most probably cost more than flOO millions f and though the expenditure may be spread out over as much as 20 years it may be beyond Egypt f s power to meet her full share of the cost (some 75-80^) without outside help in the form of loans. Apart from these schemes and such schemes as the Qena Project, however, there seems to be no reason why Egypt should not finance most of the other development projects referred to above, either out of the General Reserve, out of current revenue or by internal loans. The Palestine campaign no doubt depleted the General Reserve and put an additional strain on the budget* But direct taxation in Egypt is low and its general level will not be high even when the new '‘progressive income tax' or supertax comes into force - and the national debt is very small (a mere £E125 millions at the beginning of 1947)&gt; while there are ample funds available for investment in the country. The Egyptian Government will however need to seek external assistance in order to meet the hard currency expenditure involved in development projects# As reported above (paragraph D) they have already asked the International Bank for a loan for the Qena Project. We must no doubt expect increased pressure on His Majesty's Government to provide dollars against sterling. His Majesty’s Government recognises no obligation to supply Egypt with hard currency, but our dependence on Egyptian cotton, together/-24- together with various other factors, ohliges us at oresent to provide a limited amount of dollars as part of any financial agreement. We must also expect the Egyptians to ask for ever larger releases from the blocked sterling balances to cover purchases of capital equipment. This however, should not .present an acute problem-in the^ near future since the amounts already released are amply sufficient to ’meet Egypt’s requirements for some time to come, assuming that there is not a catastrophic fall in cotton orices. 2• External material assistance Egypt is and will remain dependent on foreign countries for the supply of materials and equipment. For the Qena and Aswan tube-well irrigation scheme very large numbers of pumping sets will be required. Pumps, again, are needed for the villages drinking water project as well as pipes, while electric generating machinery, diesel and electric motors, tractors and other agricultural machinery,• chemical plant for the fertiliser factory, and large quantities of construc tional steel are among the many items which P gypt will have to obtain from abroad. The world demand for this type of material is probably much ih excess of world capacity and Egyptian development schemes, unless they are properly planned and co-ordinated, are therefore likely to be held up by sheer shortage of' supply, quite apart from, hard currency stringency which limits procurement from the hard currency area. Owing to Egypt’s shortage of Tiar-d currency and to the sterling balances the United Kingdom has a preferential position as a supplier against, e.g. the United States and Belgium, but not against countries to which Egypt can pa;/ sterling (o.g. at present Sweden). This does not, however, relieve United kingdom 1 exporters of the necessity for making their offers as competitive as possible, as regards both price, delivery dates and terms of contract. Firms on the Continent of Europe, by going further to meet the agypti'ans’ wishes, are making inroads in several sections of the capital’goods market which used to be predominantly British preserves. 3• Exte r nal Technical Assistance Technical assistance falls into three types:- (a) assistance and advice by individual experts to Government /departmentsdepartments and planning organisations; (b) the services of consulting engineers in connexion with specific projects; (c) the services of foreign contracting firms. 43* As regards a) the Egyptian Government continues to show a welcome tendency to call in the services of experts: about a year ago experts on food canning, industrial chemistry, iron smelting and business efficiency were appointed; and three international commissions ? of three to five members each, have been appointed in the last two years to examine and report bn different aspects of the Aswan hydro-electric scheme. Other foreign experts of various nationalities have been called in for short periods to advise on certain projects. In addition the experts attached to the British Middle East Office are available for consultation by the Egyptian Government and are frequently so consulted. Although public works contracting and constructional engineering has developed considerably in Egypt in the last 10 years there is still a field for foreign enterprise, particularly where the work requires specialised equipment* The £E3 million Edfina Barrage went to a foreign contractor, and there is talk of entrusting the drilling of wells for the Qena Project to an American firm. Apart from the above, the assistance which Egypt expects to receive from us is mainly material (i.e. the supply of goods) and technical. As regards the latter, the services of the Development Division of the British Middle East Office are alrbady available. And we should continue to use every endeavour to find experts for special posts which the Egyptian Government wish to fill. Another/- 26 - Another possible form of technical assistance is the training of industrial technicians and supervisors in C foremanship and induatrial organisation as well as in technical subjects. The Egyptian Government and Egyptian firms alike are beginning to see the advantages of such training and to look to the United Kingdom to provide it; but difficulties have been encountered, both in finding factories in the United Kingdom willing to accept candidates for their practical training, and also (in one instance) in arranging for an instructor to come to Egypt* P. CONCLUSIONS , Egypt is largely over-populated. The habitable area is small and cannot be largely increased and a better balance of population increase is essential. The last decennial increase was 19.8^ as compared with b»b% in England and Wales. There is a large under-employment in v ’gypt, particularly in the vast rural areas and the gap between population increase and productive capacity is widening. Agriculture is the source of three-fifths of the gross national pro duct and one third of the population is dependent upon it. The surplus population on the land was estimated, in the prosperous year of 1945 , at about two fifths of the population dependent upon agriculture. Agricultural land is v/atered from the Nile and the outside limit of the cultivable area that v/ill result from the execution of all Nile development schemes is only greater than the present area. Industrial and other employment are not yet large alternative sources for the absorption of existing and increasing over-population and under employment. /immediate4 - 27 - Immediate short and long-term planning is therefore al for correcting the population increase and stepping up productive capacity in all its aspects, and for the mobilisation of all Egypt's internal and external economic and financial resources. There are a number of short-term projects already contemplated or in course of execution in the promotion ox which li.h.G. could usefully help. But such help would only be a contribution to an uncoordinated and unplanned attempt to deal with the symptoms of the basis malady. Assistance can be of real and lasting value only if the projects form the short-term portion of a well- conceived plan designed after careful study for application over a long period. The Bile Waters Projects themselves which, since their execution is likely to require some 25 years, might be called a long-term plan, can in fact do no more than provide cultivable land for the population which is to be expected at the time of their completion. They can therefore do no more than prevent a deterioration of the existing position. Moreover the level of available agri cultural land does not by any means constitute the whole problem but is only one factor of several. for example, an improvement in the health of the population is essential for a solution. But an advance in hygiene and sanitation and medical attention will result in an augmented rate of population increase. Better and more appropriate education is no less essential and this might mitigate the effects of improved hygiene. But an education which leads the people to desire better living conditions may also produce such a conscious discontent as to precipitate an upheaval before an effective redistribution of wealth and improvements in living conditions can he achieved. Improved hygiene and improved education must therefore keep / stepTVS - 28 - step with one another and with improvements in the standard of living. Otherwise the last state of ni gypt ^ will certainly he no better, and will probably be worse, than the first. The Egyptian Government have now approached us for our advice and assistance and we should do all in our power to help ^gypt to make progress herself in her own way. It has been suggested to the Egyptian Foreign Minister that his Government should consult the British Middle Fast Office, because experts are already available there with considerable knowledge of the problems and because the use of already established machinery need attract no special attention unless the Egyptian Government so desire. On the other hand, the Egyptian Government have been told that if they would prefer to proceed by some other means, such as special joint machinery whether through a Commission or Working Parties, this would be equally agreeable. The initiative, we hope, wi.ll come from the Egyptians and it is best that their own problems should be diagnosed and the remedy prescribed by themselves. But we should take full advantage of this opportunity to strengthen Anglo-Egyptian friendship and we should do all in our power to help in the most effective way possible.DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OP THE BRITISH MIDDLE E/-ST OFFICE.

(signed m,m. DU MERTON Cabinet Office, S.W .1 29th June, TO2./ 4 CONFIDENTIAL MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENT: IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES Previous Papers A previous Paper approved by the Middle East (Official) Committee ( M.E.(o)(49) 14 of 10th May) summarised the arguments in favour of action by His Majesty's Government to assist in the economic and social development of the Middle East and recommended certain principles which His Majesty's Government might adopt. Individual Papers on Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Transjordan (M.E.(0)(49) 15, 17, 19 and 20 respectively) have since been prepared as a background and detailed Justification of whatever specific recommendations it might be decided to put forward. A Paper on the Lebanon (M.E.(o) (49) 21 ) will be circulated shortly. These countries (apart from Egypt which is important because of the Nile Waters Projects) were chosen as the most urgent in view of their particular relevance to the resettlement of refugees. Other country studies are being prepared: Persia, whose development plans are farther advanced than those of any other Middle East country but are less dependent, at this stage, on external assistance; the Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, where scope for development other than of oil is limited but whose vast earnings from oil raise most interesting problems and possibilities; the former Italian Colonies, where at present the average annual cost to His Majesty's Government in respect of administration expenses and budgetary deficits approaches £li million; Ethiopia, whose development possibilities may be considerable but whose administration is amongst the least progressive in the Middle East; and the Yemen, the most primitive of the Arab States.2 . The object of this Paper The object of this Paper is to sift the large amount of a* detailed information now available and to recommend the practical application of the agreed principles in the light of the most urgent actual requirements and of the best estimate it is possible to make of the cost and timing of selected projects. The questions to be decided are, firsts what are the best projects to encourage and, secondly, what contribution His•Majesty 1 s Government can and should make. We cannot ourselves make a final selection of projects for execution since such a large proportion of the necessary resources are outside our control. But we can decide in our own minds what we consider to be a reasonable pro gramme, We can then try to secure its adoption and, over and above our own contribution, to enlist assistance from the United States Government, the International Bank and other sources, 3« In selecting projects for inclusion in the programme Of development referred to below (paragraph 4) the Committee has been guided by the following objectives and criteria: (a) Objectives (i) To promote those types of economic activity, whether primary or industrial, in which the countries concerned are best fitted to engage, having regard to the balance of their economies and the advantage of external* trade; (ii) To raise living standards as rapidly as levels of productivity permit; . , (iii) To secure the maximum mutual advantage of the United Kingdom and the Middle East, having regard to any assistance, material or technical, which the United Kingdom may be able to provide; (iv) To build up the capital equipment of the Middle East countries so as to provide a firm basis for future development._ 3 - (b) Criteri a (i) The proposed development should he an ^ economic proposition and will continue to be; (ii) In present circumstances those projects which promise early results are to be preferred, in particular those which assist in providing an early solution to the problem of refugee resettlement. The Committee does not feel that the resettlement of Arab refugees should be considered as c»n entirely separate matter, as many schemes which accord with the above objectives and criteria should assist in solving this problem. Indeed, schemes which are economically the soundest are those best suited to meet' it and to furnish a permanent and ultimately self-supporting solution, independent of further international aid. 4. pesc ripti on of Annexes Annexed to this Paper are: A. A list of selected projects with a short description of the benefits to be derived from some of them and.with a rough approximation of the cost and of the time required for execution. B. Extracted from (A) a list of the total internal and external expenditure of the five countries concerned over the total period involved. ^ C. A more detailed analysis of (b) showing the internal and external expenditure of each country intncb year from 1953-1955 and a global figure for the remaining years under - consideration. D. Rough estimates of the material required by each country. 5 , A11 itude of local G- Middle East Governments have of recent years tended oo showto. i! M show more interest in internal developmoct and have already made some progress, although their ideas on relative priorities are not always in accord with the criteria referred to above* The acceptance by Middle East Governments of the programme outlined above, as it stands, may therefore require in some cases a considerable reorientation of their present views, which tend to favour rnther more sophisticated projects. We consider that the programme set out in Annex A represents the most that can reasonably ■ftO achieved and digested by the economies of these countries, having regard to the limitations of finance, labour and materials, and after taking as full account as we are able of their share of any outside assistance that they can reasonably expect to receive from the United States, the United kingdom, the International Bank and any other source* Moreover, should it turn out that we have underestimated the available resources, we consider that anything^additional should be applied so as to effect the speedier completion of the programme outlined rather than to extend that programme. It is therefore as important to discourage ’’bad 1 ’ projects as to encourage ”good ” 4 ones. This does not mean that wo regard' the programme recommended as exhaustive or that any fresh project which may be put forward and which could be shown to satisfy the criteria set out in paragraph 3 (b) above should be resisted. It is at the stage when assistance is being offered, either by ourselves or the United States, that the best opportunity presents itself of securing those objectives which we consider to be the most desirable, by attaching reasonable conditions to the grant of such aid. If we do not resolve to tackle this admittedly knotty problem now, the opportunity may well be lost.. 6 . Total cost . It is emphasised that the figures for the cost of the projects recommended and for the length of time involved are in most cases extremely rough estimates since hardly any actual P 1 ^ y^/ xist *-5- ^&gt;j e ct to the se reservations the total estimated cost of the projects set out in the annexes is roughly £ 222 , 000 , 000 , the bulk of which is spread over the next ten years. Of this about £ 120 , 000,000 may be for external expenditure on services and material, including # 60 , 000,000 (or about £15,000,000 sterling) for the purchase of material only available in the U.S. The remaining £ 100 , 000,000 would be for internal expenditure# 7* Ge neral Bene fijts .of Jjhe projects. The studies undertaken cover in most cases the period 1950 - 60 and show that there are possibilities for development which if carried out successfully would produce, among other things the following results (a) General strengthening of the economies of the countries concerned. (b) Control of the disastrous river floods in Iraq which cost on an average about £1 million a year and cause large crop losses; and the lowering of flood risk in Egypt. (c) Increased production of food, e.g. in Iraq an annual increase of 40,000 to 50,000 tons of rice, between 700-,000 and 800,000 tons of wheat and barley and possibly quantities of oil seeds and cotton; in Syria an increase of up to 200,000 tons of cereals, mostly wheat, and also possibly quantities of oil seeds pulses and cotton; in the Lebanon and Transjordan increased quantities of fruit and vegatables; in Egypt the increased produce of between 1 and li million acres of intensively cultivated land and smaller increases from the pump irrigation schemes in the basins. (d) A valuable contribution to the solution of the Palestine refugee problem e.g. in Syria and Transjordan and possibly, but less probably, in Iraq. 8./-6- 8 , We feel that developments such as these represent the best r'N, possible contribution that can be made to the major task of ^ combating the spread of communism in the Middle East. They will need to be accompanied by the appropriate measures of social reform to ensure that the resultant increase in the national wealth is not confined to a small class but goes to raise the general standard of living by permitting increased real wages and improved social services. 9« Availability of local resources. The ability of the governments to find from their own resources the internal expenditure involved is likely to vary considerably, but for anti-inflationary reasons amongst others internal expenditure should as far as possible be financed internally. The only possible exceptions are likely to be cases in which, e.g. Transjordan, internal resources are self-evidently incapable of providing the necessary internal credit but nevertheless a development project is of such great importance and urgency for refugee resettlement purposes or other urgent purposes that some external assistance must be extended even to the provision of internal finance. 10. Attitude of the U.S. Government and International Bank. We know that the U.S. Government are extremely anxious to take some concrete step to assist in the resettlement of Arab refugees and to make a contribution either under this heading or as part of the Fourth Point programme or as an independent operation to Middle East development generally. It is however, still quite uncertain what funds it will be possible to obtain from Congress and for what particular purposes. Since American policy is still in so formative a stage on this subject, we have/-7- h^ve perhaps a good opportunity for influencing it in what we consider the right direction. The International Bank is already showing interest in Egyptian and Iraqi projects. The Bank is also anxious to assist so far as it can with refugee resettlement but the difficulty here is that the Bank is normally precluded by its terms of reference from making loans which do not secure a commercial return. In certain cases where the Bank is unable to make a normal loan, we should consider the possibility (suggested by the late President of the Bank) of its doing so in return for guarantees by the U.S. Government and/or H.M. Government (see M.E.(O)(49) 10 of 26 th April ). - 11 . Direct advantages to the U«K_» (a) The completion of the agricultural schemes will add considerably to the available supplies of soft currency cereals and will thus save dollars to the U.K. and the sterling area. For example, sterling area wheat from Australia which has been imported into the Middle East will tend to become available for other sterling area countries including the U.K. There should also be increased surpluses of Middle iast barley for export to the sterling area countries, such as India and the U.K. (b) Development in the Middle East should provide opportunities for expansion of British trade. Considerable imports of capital equipment will be required and most of the large contracts for development works will have to be placed overseas. It is clear however from the relatively very small part of the Aswan Dam electrification schemes which have been allotted to British contractors that a special effort will have to be made if we are to gain the share of this market which would be desirable. (We should also bear in mind that if contracts go to United States firms the dollar cost will in many cases directly or indirectly fall on the U.K.). The raising of the general standard of living in the Middle East should offer further opportunities/-8- (iii)/ opportunities for increasing the sale of British consumer goC^a, ' 12 * and the Fourth Point* The implementation of the Fourth Point by the United States will involve them in contributions both to the United Nations and bilaterally. The President has already asked Congress for $ U5 million, the distribution as between the United Nations and bilateral arrangements to be left to the Presidents discretion. As far as the U.K* is concerned, apart from any specific contribution which we may make to the United Nations effort, the financial, material and technical resources which we make available to British overseas territories will undoubtedly form a major part of our general contribution to the cause of economic development. We will, in addition, certainly be expected to make further bilateral contributions, particularly in an area such as the Middle East with which we are so closely associated, and it will moreover be in our commercial as well as our political interests to do so. The means of contribution open to us arei— (a) Technical, which may be of the following types - (i) The appointment of British officials to key posts in Middle East administrations. (In certain exceptional cases of particular importance where the conditione offered by the Government concerned are not high enough to attract the right man, it may be necessary to consider subsidies from British official funds. The Working Party did not however feel able to make a unanimous - —recommendation oa thLspoint.. A separate Paper is being prepared). (ii) The strengthening of the permanent and temporary staff of the Development Division of the B.M.E.O.( 3 )/ -9- (iii) Increasing the facilities for Middle East technicians to undergo technical training in the U. K. and the Middle East. (b) Financial and material (i) The very occasional grant of direct loans as in the case of the £1 million loan to Transjordan* (ii) Support for applications for loans from the International Bank to member Governments and participation in such loans where appropriate. (iii) Approval for the raising of loans in the City of London by Middle East administrations* (iv) The release of sterling balances* (This must of course be considered in the context of our general policy governing sterling releases)* (v) Assistance in the procurement of materials and equipment in short supply. 13 * Recommendations It is recommended that - (1) H*M*G* should approve the list of projects in Annex (A) as a reasonable programme of development in the countries concerned. (2) It should be accepted that this programme will involve the contribution by H.M.G. of certain limited technical, financial and material resources, but that the amount of this contribution cannot be accurately determined until it is known what contributions are available from the United States, the International Bank and other sources and until international policy with regard to the settlement of Arab refugees has been worked out in detail*&lt;* - 10 - (3) Early discussion on the basis of this programme should be held with the U»S, Government and the International Bank with a view to their accepting it as a concrete programme and making the greatest possible contributions to its implementation* (4) The programme should also be used as a brief for discussion with the Middle East governments concerned and in particular with Middle East Development Boards as soon as these are set up in the hope that they will .also adopt this programme or something as like it as possible and will make the maximum contributions towards its implementation*TRANSJORDAN ANNEX D IRAQ YEAR MATERIAL 1950-60 Dam and irrigation construction material (sluices, reinforcing material, etc;) Contractors’ plant 1950-54 1950- 60 1951 - 60 Railway material Cement Agricultural equipment AMOUNT OR VALUE 12.000 tons 2,700 tons £ 1.25 million 80.000 tons (a) £ 3*5 million or #14 million 1956-60 Road-making machines Bridge-making material £ 0*5 million 1,000 tons (NOTE (a): The amount and currency depend on the type of tractors and agricultural implements which the Iraqi Government will accept,).

Transjordan plus Arab Palestine - is now a political fact. Its boundaries on the western side have not, of course, yet been agreed, but it may be estimated that the population of the new State will amount to about 800,000 excluding the the 500,000 refugees who are at present established in it. To ensure the stability and prosperity of this new State must be for some time to come a cardinal factor of our foreign policy in the Middle East. Transjordan itself is, however, still in a state of primitive rural economy and its standard of living is low, particularly in comparison with the standard of living enjoyed by Arab Palestine under the Mandatory Government. 2. The known economic resources of Greater Transjordan are slight. The economy of the country is essentially agricultural. There are extensive phosphate deposits near Amman in the north and the Wadi el Hasa which have so far only been developed to a limited degree, owing partly to transport difficulties and partly to lack of markets, and the Potash Works at the north end of the Dead Sea, which it is hoped will remain in Transjordan territory when the peace settlement with Israel is concluded but which have been totally destroyed by Jewish and Arab action. There ^re limited agricultural development possibilities, .involving irrigation works in the Jordan Valley and improvement of crop production in the hill lands of Arab Palestine. A subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company is prospecting for oil but no deposits have so far been found. 3 * The broad conclusion has been reached by H.M. Minister at Amman and H.M. Consulate-General at Jerusalem that /Greater1 - 2 - Greater Transjordan coaid become an economically viable state, but only at a low standard of living. This means, j in fact, that the standard of living of Arab Palestine w^l have to be reduced to the level of that at present prevailing in Transjordan proper, and such a reduction will, in certain respects at least, be drastic. (It is estimated, for instance, that expenditure on public services such as health and education will have to be reduced by about 80$)• This conclusion was reached without taking into account the burden imposed upon Transjordan by the necessity for absorbing at least a large proportion of 500,000 refugees. (See II below). Unless, therefore, some unexpected development occurs, such as the discovery of oil or the sudden opening up of large markets for her phosphates, it is likely to be many years before the new state will be able to earn a revenue sufficient to provide for a substantial rise in the standard of living. Meanwhile, financial assistance from outside sources is required for development projects (s) to make possible the resettlement of the Arab refugees, and (b) to enable the new state to become established on a sound economic basis. The political stability of Arab Palestine largely depends upon the progress which the Transjordan government can make in restoring some measure of economic prosperity. It will, ^ moreover, be of great importance to the economic prpaperity •f the country that satisfactory commercial and economic relatiXcuus with Israel should be established. ( /Hr -3- [IUU .JXr PRESET FINANCI/.L POSITION Transjordan’s present financial position i» precarious♦ Her imports in 1947 were at the rate of £9i million per annum ^(including £3,300,000 for the I*P.C.) and in 1948 at £ 11 ^ million (including £900,000 for the I.P.C.) (The increase in 1948 is accounted for by the needs of Arab Palestine, and actually indicates a decrease in the imports of Transjordan itself#) Recorded exports and re-exports amounted in 1947 to £ 871 , 000 , and in 1948 to £ 2 |- million but in addition there is a large unrecorded re-export trade. Further assistance towards closing this gap between imports and exports is at present provided by:- (a) His Majesty’s Government’s subsidy to the Arab Legion which has been hitherto at the rate of £2 million per annum; and for the year 1949-50 will be £3 million,. (b) The assumption of responsibility for short-term relief for the refugees by the United Nations; 5# Moreover, imports at this rate would not be possible were it not for releases of blocked sterling balances wtiich are at present accumulating in the. banks at Amman as the result of the redemption of Palestine currency which has been imported into the country# Up to the end of March, 1949, a total of £?i million will have been TOleneed. From April onwards releases at the rnto of million per month were agreed, but it now appears that the amounts released will be considerably less# There is at the moment about £5 million in hand. Up till the beginning of February redemptions kept pace with releases, but since that date they have begun to fall sharply# It therefore seems possible that not much more money will be available when the £*5 million has been exhausted. 6 * Meanwhile, in the areas of Arab Palestine which TrafT%- jordan has absorbed, the standard of living and of administration. /is'4- i 8 , inevitably^ much lower than that which, prevail©^ under the former Mandatory Government and approximates, in to the standards which have hitherto prevailed in Transjordan. So far the inhabitants of Arab Palestine have accepted the necessity for this and have co-operated reasonably well with the Transjordan authorities. The need which we had anticipated last autumn for urgent short-term financial assistance to set the administration of this area on its feet - His Majesty's Minister of Amman estimated that million might be required for this purpose - did not materialise# The country is, however, impoverished and unless the Transjordan Government can restore some measure of economic prosperity serious political unrest may be expected. 7* As regards 3( a )* however, we are anxious to promote conditions in which it will be possible to discontinue direct subsidies to the Arab Legion# Investment in ‘the economic development of Transjordan should be a means of removing this recurrent burden from His Majesty’s Government. As regards 3(H) it is now generally agreed that the Government of Israel will allow only a small proportion of the refugees in Greater Transjordan to return to their homes# It is, therefore, desirable that re-settlement should begin as soon as possible. The Transjordan Government are under stood to be willing in principle to absorb a large proportion of these refugees into Transjordan. The United Nations programme for the maintenance of the refugees is unlikely to last beyond the end of this year. 8 . The United Nations Conciliation Commission is responsible for arranging resettlement of the refugees and it is hoped that it will succeed soon in working out plans. /TheseThese plans will have to include the investigation of all possible sources of external fiaancfal-assis.tance - e*g* the International Bank, private investments, direct government loans, etc., * 9« Meanwhile, in view of the urgency both of stabilising the internal economy and promoting refugees resettlement, His Majesty’s Government have made an interest-free loan of £1 million to the Transjordan Government to enable it to undertake immediately certain short-term development and resettlement projects described in paragraph III (•$) below. Membership of International Bank 10 * Transjordan is not yet a member of the International Bank. The Transjordan Government were not, in fact, until recently alive to its existence. Were they to be admitted to membership of the Bank, and first, of the International Monetary Fund, His Majesty’s Government would have to make available against sterling the small quantity of gold required for their subscription, and to provide dollars to service and repay any dollar loan obtained. III. THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC BEVEL0PM] ' T T (-0 MINOR PROJECTS Plans for three minor development and resettlement projects have been drawn up, for which His Majesty’s Government have granted an interest-free loan of £1 million (see paragraph II: above). Further .details are contained in Annex A. (2) COMMUNICATIONS (a) PORT Transjordan’s only port is Aqaba, some 240 miles from Amman. Port facilities' are undeveloped chiefly because communications with the interior are too difficult to make it worth using. Ip order to improve the port* /dredging6 - • dredging at an estimated cost of £P 10,000 would be required# (b) Rj'ilLWAYS The railway from Naqb Ashtar to Amman is now working and improvements are being made gradually by the Transjordan Government# The extension from Damascus to Beirut is in operation and has been one oT^irh^- main Ij nea of supply for Transjordan since the railway to Haifa was cut by Jewish terrorists who blew up the Hammeh Bridge over the Yarmuk in 1947. (o) ro/js Connecting Aqaba with Naqb Ashtar at the top of the escarpment 50 miles away is a metalled road built by the British Army during the late war# It needs extensive repairs in places where sudden torrents have washed it away# Estimates of the cost of restoring the road vary from £P 46,000 to about £P 100,000# It is also estimated that the earth track from Naqb Ashtar t«^Ammaa c-ould-be converted into a fair-weather road at a cost varying between £P 34,000 and £P 50,000. This: section is however already served by the railway (see (b)iabove.) Under the Annex;to the Anglo-Transjordan Treaty the Transjordan Government can call upon His Majesty’s Government to assist in maintaining and developing lines of communication in | and across Transjordan for purposes of mutual defence. Among the lines of communication covered by the Annex is the section i / of the Haifa-Bagdad road from Mafraq eastwards to the Iraqi frontier# It is estimated that His Majesty’s Government’s share of the annual maintenance costs of this road might amount to £P 17 * 500 # The cost of maintaining the metalled road in ^astern Palestine, in addition to those already existing in /Transjordanr [W) P) I! -7- Transjor-dan, will be considerable, but no precise estimate is available. If the major Jordan Valley Project (see paragraph 111 ( 3 ) below) is to be carried out, an essential from the outset will be the construction of an all-weather road from North to South, with bridges over the many wadis. ( 3 ) JORDAN-YAMUK CANALISATION PROJECT (D Description of Project 11 , Mr. M.G. lonides, formerly Development Officer to the Mandatory Government of Transjordan, prepared a report on the water resources of Transjordan and their development in 123^^ &amp;I ^. recommended that a major irrigation project, involving the canalisation of the waters of the Jordan and the Yarmuk, was practicable. The carrying out of this project is now a matter of great importance from the point of view of the resettlement of the Arab refugees* Mr. G* Walpole, the present Director Ox Land Surveys in Transjordan, has prepared a rough estimate of the cost of this Scheme and the numbers who might be settled as a result of it. Mr* Walpole assumes intensive cultivation would be developed as a result of the project and that all the owned land in the Jordan Valley would be purchased from its present owners and redistributed as holdings of 23 dunums (5*73 acres) per family on cultivation leases. Half the mean annual discharge of the Jordan and Yarmuic rivers would be utilised for the full development of the project. On this basis Mr. Walpole estimates that the project could provide for the settlement of 12,000 families. He estimates the total cost as follows: Cost of expropriation £1,891,600 Canalisation of the Jordan and Yarmuk 7,300,000 Diversion of the Yarmuk winter floods into Lake Tiberias for use in the summer 300,000 Housing of 12,000 families at £300 per house 3 , 600,000 Purchase of implements and ploughing animals at £100 per family 1 , 200,000 Anti-Malaria work 50,000 Unforeseen expenditure 250 J&gt; Q00 Total £1U.991.600 /1 2 .4 T - 8 - 12* Mr. Walpole points out that the Jordan Valley is climatically particularly well situated for the production of special crops (e#g* vegetables and fruit) which can be placr*V on the market much earlier than similar crops grown elsewhere and therefore bring in higher prices* This would involve a * complete reorientation agriculturally, since the present agricultural economy of the Jordan Valley is based entirely on cereals* Markets would have to be assured in advance, particularly for fresh, perishable commodities, before new crops are produced on a large scale. If quantities of cash crops are developed in the Jordan Valley it should be possible to charge cultivators there higher rents than are paid elsewhere* He recommends that the loan or loans which will be required to finance the project should be raised on the security of the land and repaid from the revenue that will accrue from the cultivators’ rents. He estimates that the annual revenue from rent might amount to £ 750,000 while the annual cost of maintenance might be about £250,000, thus leaving an annual balance for payment of interest and annual payments into a sinking fund of £500,000. On this basis, it would take the Transjordan Government some thirty years to repay the loan. Mr. Walpole recommends that an Authority should be set up to administer the project. The Authority would lay down crop policy and market the produce. 13* In addition to the numbers of direct settlers for whom the project might provide (about 60,000 individuals) it is estimated that up to 6,000 non-agricultural breadwinners might also be employed in ancillary occupations. Each might be expected on the average to support a family of 4* A further 30,000 persons might thus be indirectly resettled. Proposals made to date have boon on the assumption that it will be necessary to expropriate present landowners from all /except-9- cxcopt 25 dunitAs (5«75 &amp;orcs) of land for each owner* It is likely ^that expropriation would affect about i+»000 native* Jordanians* This obviously raises major political and social problems which will have to be •arofully considered* It may bo that alternative methods will have to be devised of dividing the land up for settlement* The revenue from the scheme will depend upon the* Government^ ability to collect tho higher rents envisaged in paragraph 12 above* (ii) Appointment of an irrigation survey. 15* Meanwhile, the Transjordan Government have appointed the British engineering firm of Sir Murdoch MacDonald and Partners to review the ground' the 'studies already made and complete the &gt; work of Mr* lonides* Their report will aim at stating in which areas it would be worthwhile to have a detailed engineering survey made and what the given volcime of water required for the works involved would be* This review will take 3 or months and will cost about £5,500 to £6,000* Before any action canbe taken by Transjordan on the project, however, it will be necessary for her first to reach an agreement in principle with the Government of Israel regarding the use of the waters of these rivers* Since the Israeli frontier runs for some distance down the centres of the rivers the waters belong equally to both States* Agreements with Syria and the Lebanon will probably also be necessary, since the head waters of the Jordan are in both countries and the Yarmuk has its source in Syria* (iii) Israeli irrigation development project 16 * The Transjordan Government 1 s announcement of their intention to carry out a survey of the project has in fact provoked an immediate hostile reaction from Israel, where it is considered that the whole idea is a British plot to forestall /Jewish- 10 - Jewish initiative in developing the area in question. The Israeli Government is, moreover, understood to be now considering the implementation of the 'Hays-Savage' Scheme, which provides for the irrigation of some 600,000 acres in Palestine by the use of the waters of the Jordan. It is known that this scheme was drawn up without consultation with either the Palestine or Transjordan Governments. It is not clear, from such information about it as is available here, whether its implementation would necessarily deprive Transjordan of what might be considered her fair share of water - i.e. half the annual discharge of the Jordan and the Yarmuk. Since, moreover, the full development of tho scheme involves the construction of a dam in Syria, and the use of the waters of the Litani river in the Lebanon for hydro-electric power, the agreement of the Syrian and Lebanese Government will probably have to be sought before it can be implemented. It is understood that no detailed surveys of works for the scheme have yet been made* 17 * Moreover, although the actual canalization schemes for the two countries will necessarily be separate and distinct, it seems certain that the irrigation development of the two countries will require joint operational control at certain points. For example the regulation of the sluices at the outlet from the sea of Galilee will affect the interests of both countries; and at the point in the upper Jordan whence the Hays canal would take its supply westwards to the coastal plain areas, arrangements have to be made for regulating the seasonal flow of water in accordance with the interest of Transjordan, as well as Israel. The joint interests of the two countries would also be involved if it were decided to make a diversion from the Yarmuk into the sea /ofof Galilee for the storage of the rivers flood waters; such a diversion would pass through into Israeli territory and the benefits derived from it and its day-to-day operation would affect both countries* (iv) Palestine Electric Corporation: 18* All these Schemes will involve the drastic revision, if not cancellation, of the concession of the Jewish- Palestine Electric Corporation, which operates the Rutenberg electricity works at the confluence of the Jordan and the Yarrnuk* Since the plant has never supplied Transjordan, and since Israel is now obtaining almost all its electricity by other means, negotiations on this matter are unlikely to present difficulty except from the point of view of the private interests involved* . (4) AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 19# The Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office has recently prepared a Report for His Majesty^ Government on present agricultural conditions in Transjordan, His view is that agricultural development in Transjordan appears to lie largely in the substitution of fruit-growing - olives, grapes, etc. - on a considerable scale for cereal cultivation on land which is obviously marginal for ordinary crop production. The soundness of such a policy is illustrated by what has already been accomplished in this direction on the hills in several villages in the North* His conclusion is that only by such means can much of the poor land throughout the country support a largap'population or even provide a reasonable livelihood for those already depending on it for existence* 20* A summary of Sir Herbert Stewart's Report is attached at Annex B.- 12 - (5) ANIMAL HUSBANDRY . 21 • Before the disastrous drought of 1947* Transjordan hjTl a considerable export' surplus of sheep, and when the project for constructing water-holes referred to in Annex A is undertaken it should be possible to restore this surplus in due course* There is likely to be a considerable market of sheep, sent on the hoof, in Israel. 22. Meanwhile, the agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office is considering the possibilities of improving the pasturage. ( 6 ) FISHERIES 23. The fisheries at Aqaba are capable of expanslou either to meet a rising internal demand or for export to Israel, Egypt and other neighbouring countries. Certain small capital expenditure on the provision of a collecting ship and/ or refrigerated- lorries might be required. It is considered likely‘that Transjordan could provide this herself. (7) PHOSPHATES 24* Transjordan possesses extensive phosphate deposits, reported to be of high quality. Hitherto these have been mined on an extremely limited scale by a small Transjordan Company and exported to neighbouring states. Attempts made in 1947 to secure British participation in the Company proved unsuccessful.. Nor have His Majesty^ . Government felt able to take any active steps to promote this production in view of the lack at present (according to our information) of any large scale markets for Transjordan phosphates either in Europe, -^ast Africa or Asia. Certain Italian commercial interests have, however, now decided /to\ -13- to undertake this development# The Transjordan Company has been reconstituted with six Italian and five Transjordan directors, a nominal capital of £1 ~k million and a paid up capital of £660,000 in which the Italians have a controlling interest. The Transjordan Government has granted a thirty- year concession to the Company for the development of all the deposits in the country. Under the terms of the concession, the Government will receive royalties but no share in the Company’s profits. 25. A British engineer who surveyed the mines in 1946 to ^9k7 estimated that a maximum of 300,000 tons per annum might be produced from the Roseifa mines near Amman if £ 700,000 were spent on developmenc, and a maximum of 900,000 tons per annum from the El-Hasa mines if £ 3 * 000,000 were spent on development. The natural outlet for the former mines would be northwards by the He^jaz railway and for the latter southwards via the gulf of Aqaba. The Company are at present planning to export northwards, mainly to Italy but also to Syria, the Lebanon, and possibly Israel. They estimate that the railway could transport 600,000 tons annually if additional rolling stock were provided. Later on the Company hope to export to the east, to India, Pakistan and Persia, and develop the Port of Aqaba for this purpose. 26. No definite information is available regarding the Company’s specific plans for expanding production, the methods by which this is to be financed and the equipment required. The Company’s legal adviser has informed the Foreign Office that the Company hope to procure a considerable proportion of their equipment, including railway wagons, 'in Italy but that some equipment will /certainly-14- certainly be required from this country and/or the United £ States* Uq promised to furnish a list of this equipment# How the Company expect to finance the scheme is by no means clear. 27 . The Company are endeavouring to obtain the participation of British interests and have approached the firm Selection Trust Limited, who have the proposal under consideration. 28 . They are also now negotiating with the Lebanese Government for permission to establish a super phosphate plant at Beirut with an eventual output of 300,000 tons per annum. His Majesty 1 s Minister at Beirut considers that the realisation of this scheme which would involve an important expansion of trade between Lebanon, Transjordan and Syria might have far-reaching effects both politically and economically. So far, however, British firms have shown no interest in it. The alternative route through Haifa, while cheaper than the Beirut route, will involve a political agreement between the Transjordan and Israeli Governments and the rebuilding of the demolished Jordan bridge. ( 8 ) POTASH 29. Before the Palestine war, Transjordan obtained an annual revenue of about &lt;£ 75*000 from royalties paid by the Palestine Potash Company Limited (registered in the United Kingdom)• 30. The northern Dead Sea works have been completely destroyed but the southern works which remained throughout the recent fighting in Israeli occupation are intact* The Company are anxious to resume production at the southern works as soon as possible, but this depends on an adequate supply of fresh water which is only obtainable at the moment from Transjordan territory. It seems unlikely that the Transjordan Government will agree to discuss this or the /general- 15 - ♦ ^ general question of Palestine Potash. Limited continuing to have a monopoly of* the potash extraction rights in the Dead Sea before a final settlement has been negotiated with Israel* 31* The Palestine Potash Company Limted, though British registered, acts as a purely Israeli company and is so regarded by the Transjordan Government* It has already been agreed inter-departmentally that we should not encourage the formation of a rival potash company in Transgordan and that, in due course, we should advise the Transjordan Government in favour of amendment of the existing concession rather than cancellation* It has consequently been agreed that while we should not press the company to resume operations in Transjordan we should not discourage them* We wish to prevent the company acquiring a position of economic domination in Transjordan but we hope to secure some financial advantage for Transjordan from co-operation with the Company* IV HEALTH SERVICES 32* An appreciation of the present situation regarding the Health Services in Arab Palestine has recently been received from Dr* Lloyd Williams, medical officer to the Consulate- General at Jerusalem* Under the Mandate the budget allocation of the Government Health Service was £ 1 , 100,000 for the year 194? to 1948* The Jews probably contributed about 6Q% of the cost of this service in the form of taxation but since they also maintained their own health service, the Arabs derived the main benefit* All the main government hospitals which existed under the Mandate and most of the voluntary hospitals are now in Jewish hands and for the population of Arab Palestine, estimated at about 625,000 there are at present available only 400 beds. The main Government laboratories producing /vaccines./37 # - 16 - vaccines^ sera, etc# are also in Israel and there is only one place in Arab Palestine where X-rays can be taken* 33 # The low incidence of malaria in Palestine was due to the intensive Public Health measures under the Mandate and.that if these cannot be maintained there is a danger that malaria will quickly again begin to take its toll. 34, Dr, Williams therefore urges that the Transjordan Government should realise their responsibility for this urgent and important problem and should insist in their negotiations with the Jews that a fair proportion of medical equipment and certain laboratories and hospitals should be handed over to them* His Majesty 1 s Minister at Amman has accordingly advised the Transjordan Government to seek the assistance of the World Health Organisation on the improvement of health services in Arab Palestine generally and to take up with the Israeli authorities ' the question of an .'equitable allocation of the medical assets of Palestine. The Transjordan Government however has So far been disinclined to take the initiative. V. APPOINTMENT OP TE CHNICAL EXP ERTS 35• The Transjordan Government at present employs the following foreign experts: Director of Lands end Surveys Development Officer (Mr. G.P. Walpole, British) Exchange Controller (Colonel F.A. Kendrick, British) Chief Curator of Antiquities (Mr. G.Y/.L. Harding, British) Irrigation Expert (Mr. P.N. Simanski - White Russian with Sudanese passport) 36* His Majesty’s Minister at Amman, His Majesty’s Consul- General at Jerusalem and the B.M.E.O. have been consulted regarding the desirability of urging the Transjordan Government to employ more British experts with particular reference to their new responsibilities in Arab Palestine.-17- 37* His Majesty's Minister at Amman considers that the appointment of a British Director of Customs would be desirable but that it would be inadvisable to press this point now. The appointment of a few agricultural specialists (an agronomist, a horticulturist, an economic botanist and a soil chemist) is recommended by the Agricultural Adviser to the B.M.E.O. if Transjordan's agriculture is to be developed and improved. Terms of Service 38 . The gross salaries earned by the experts listed above do not in any one case exceed £1,800 per annum. His Majesty’s Legation at Amman consider that these salaries are inadequate to meet the cost of living in Transjordan, particularly in view of the exorbitantly high cost of accommodation. VI. DEVELOPMENT BCAFD 39 . We are suggesting to the Transjordan Government that they should set up a small development board which might have a majority of Arab members and of which the Director of Lands and Surveys, and if possible, also the Exchange Controller would be members, and which would possess an independent budget. The loan of £1 million which we are making to Transjordan and any Development Loans subsequently received from other sources would be paid to the Board who would be responsible 1 or supervising the planning and execution of development projects. VII. RECOMMENDATIONS ( 1 ) (a) We should encourage the Transjordan Government to proceed as soon as possible with the setting up of a Development Board (paragraph VI above) uhich could, as a start, supervise the execution of the minor schemes referred to in paragraph III ( 1 ) and in Annex A, and which would also /be-18- be responsible for surveying the whole field &amp; of development and making recommendations thereon. (b) The minor projects should not, however, be delayed pending the setting up of the Development Board. The Government should concentrate on these schemes as being the projects offering: (i) the earliest substantial return in proportion to the amount of capital works likely to be required, and (ii) some assistance in the resettlement of refugees. (c) As soon as the Development Board is set up, H.M. Minister at Amman should be authorised to discuss with the Board the various development possibilities described in this Paper and the recommendations contained in Sir Herbert Stewart ! s Report (Annex B) (particularly as regards the appointment of agricultural specialists). (2) The Transjordan Government should pay particular attention to the special problems of former Arab Palestine (especially as regards health and education). (3) The Transjordan Government should also give early attention to the problem of land tenure and settlement. (See paragraph III (3) (i) above). (4) As a longer-term measure, but of equal if not greater importance to Transjordan, we should use all the means in•our power to encourage joint consultation between the Israeli and the Transjordan Government on the develop ment of any scheme for irrigation, making use of the/- 19 - ^ the waters of the Jordan and the Yarmuk (paragraph 111 ( 3 ). Ae an immediate step, the Transjordan Government should proceed at once to work out proposals in detail to support effectively their claim to a fair share of the waters. (5) We should offer all assistance in our power to the Transjordan Government to enable them to secure such items of plant and equipment as the United Kinfom can provide for the furtherance of this project. The question of any further financial assistance should be considered in the light of international policy with regard to the resettlement of Arab refugees, though there is little doubt that His Majesty f s Government will have to make available further direct financial assistance from time to time for many years ahead. ( 6 ) (a) The Transjordan Government should’ be advised to consider the desirability of revising the terms of the concession granted to the Italian Company in order to ensure that it gets a fair share of any revenue resulting from the exploitation of the phosphate deposits (paragraph III ( 7 )). (b)We should watch closely the progress of the Italian Company in their plans for the develop ment of the phosphate deposits, are convinced that these plans are sound we should take such steps as we can to assist the Company /both- 20 - both in the mining project and in the ^ proposed super-phosphate plant at Beirut, e«g* by doing our best to make av liable the equip ment they require and facilitating the participation of British commercial interests* It is possible that the International Bank might be prepared in due course to grant loans.for the carrying out of the Jordan-Yarmuk project (paragraph IH&lt;3) and the development of Transjordan phosphates (paragraph III (?)• We should, therefore, suggest to the Transjordan Government (although Transjordan is not yet a member of the Bank) that they might make informal contact with the Bank at an early stage in order to obtain the Bank f s reactions to these projects*ANNEX A MINOR DEVELOPMENT SCHEMES: REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT Plans for three short-term projects have been drawn up. These are:- (a) IRRIGATION : (i) Irrigation projects on 9 of the perennial streams running into the Jordan; (ID a pumping scheme on the left hank of the Jordan, (the Zors); (iii) a pumping scheme, 'based on springs situated at Azraq. These schemes are estimated to cost LP 315&gt;000 exclusive of resettlement costs. There is no firm estimate of the number of refugees for whom the schemes will provide. It is thought however that about 5520 and 4600 dunums (or 1380 and 1150 acres) will become available at Azraq and on the left bank respectively. (b) RESETTLEMENT the Shera 1 resettlement scheme, which is expected to resettle about 6750 persons «t a cost of LP 675,000. (c) • WATER-HOLES a project for the construction of water-holes by which it ie hoped to increase the sheep population. 2. PERENNIAL STREAMS The land affected by the perennial streams irrigation project is for the most part privately owned and, unless the Transjordan Government are prepared to. introduce a scheme for the expropriation of all land in excess of a certain area per present owner or cultivator, any effective measure for the resettlement of refugees will depend on the co-operation of private landowners, A good augury is afforded by the recently completed Wadi el Arab scheme (on v/hich the remaining 9 schemes will be modelled). It is reported that as many as 3000 refugees have been resettled by means of this scheme, through private arrangements made by individual landowners. 3. THE ZORS . The left-bank (Zors) pumping scheme can however make an immediate, though limited, contribution towards the resettlement of refugees. The Zors lands concerned are all in Government ownership and no expropriation problem arises. The lands will require to be cleared of scrub and levelled. /Bundsr - 2 - Bunds will have to be built in certain places to prevent^ flooding in winter# The bank will require protection from erosion, and pumps will have to be supplied for irrigation. If intensively cultivated and divided into 25 dunum plots, the lands could provide for the settlement of 1030 persons. U. AZRAQ The present scheme covers an area of only 5520 dunums, which will probably provide for about 55 families (275 persons). Pumps will be required for irrigation from exiSuing springs. On the other hand, there may be substantial possibilities for close settlement over a wider area. It is thought that as large an area as 100,000 square kilometres (about 100,000 dunums) might be physically suitable for agricultural development and afforestation in the Azraq region. Certain investigations would however have to be made (a topographical survey, a soil survey, the testing of underground water supplies) and drainage and flood control would have to be tackled. Pull development of the 100,000 dunums would cost about LP 1 million and would provide for about 10,000 persons on a basis of intensive agriculture. The cost of the actual works (exclusive of resettlement) would be about LP 400,000. All these estimates are however subject to revision in the light of an accurate survey. shera The Shera scheme is a resetiHement project on what is thought* £0 be adequately rainfed land in the highlands near Ma an. It has been estimated that about 6750 persons could be settled on 270,000 dunums at a cost of LP 675,000. The cost would include the purchase of a. house, an underground cistern, implements, seeds, ploughing animals and a few sheep for each family. Farming would be conducted on an extensive basis. The chief use of the Shera is however for summer grazing by the Howeitat tribe and difficulty may arise over claims to the land while allowance will probably have to be made for the purchase of the grazing rights which have been acquired. The area in question is vaguely registered as Government land. Little is known of the agricultural possibilities of the Shera. But it is thought that cereal cultivation a^Lone cannot be expected to provide a reasonable livelihood# It may be possible to substitute rain-fed fruits of‘some sort for at least part of the present cereal cultivation. 6. COMPARISON BETWEEN THE SHERA AND AZRAQ SCHEMES The estimates for the Shera and Azraq schemes v/ork out at LP 500 per family in each case. The area covered by the former is 270,000 dunums, while the estimate of the latter^ potentialities is 100,000 dunums. But the Shera scheme is based on extensive agriculture and provides for only 1350 families while the full exploitation of the Azraq scheme might provide for 2000 families by close settlement. There seems to be less doubt about land rights in the case of the Azraq scheme. Both schemes could, of course, be put into execution progressively. /?.7. GOVERNMENT LAND - 3 - As far as Government land is concerned, about ^375&gt;163 dunums might eventually be available, for the resettlement of 3556 families (or 17,780 persons) at an estimated cost of LP 1,768,000 all told* The land commanded by the Jordan Valley perennial streams which are in private ownership are excluded from this calculation. 8. WATER-HOLES The water-holes project v/ill be of no direct benefit to refugees, who arc not pastoralists in the desert sense of the word. The holes will be merely unlinod earth-tanks which will hold rainwater for a time and thus supply additional drinking water. They may also open up to grazing some new areas where the absence of water makes it impossible to graze now. The average cost of each water-hole might be £P550. A construction unit, comprising a bull-dozer, etc. , might cost about £P8000, and interest on the capital expenditure on this item, plus loss on resale, will have to be taken into account. 9. SUMMARY The attached table summarises the areas of potential development, and of the costs of the schemes described in the foregoing paragraphs. The £1 million loan granted by His Majesty's Government will do no more than cover the development costs of the perennial streams project and the development and resettlement costs of the Shera scheme, with perhaps something to spare for the Zors project and limited development at Azraq. Prom the information at present available, the Azraq. area appears to be worth a close and careful survey.ANNEX B AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT Summary of the Report by the Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office . 1. Agricultural Statistics Transjordan, like most other Middle East countries needs to put its agricultural statistics on a more reliable basis than at^ present. Possibly statistics connected with other departments of Government require a similar overhaul. The Statistical Adviser to the British Middle East Office has already prepared detailed plans for improving the statistical organisation of all departments of the Governments of Iraq and Iran and these are being put into execution. He will shortly undertake the preparation of plans in the same connexion for Syria and the Lebanon. It is suggested that Transjordan should utilise his services to put all their statistics on a sound footing. II. Agricultural Industries These industries are restricted at present to small-scale manufacture of tobacco, wines and spirits. If present agricultural policy and practice in the Jordan Valley are reorientated so as to make the best use of irrigation supplies, tobacco may become a profitable crop in that area. Increased production will lead presumably to greater manufacture. 2. A considerable expansion can take place in the output of wines and spirits if (a) the ravages of Phylloxera are adequately combatted and counteracted by an all-out drive for the production and destruction of resistant vine stock (b) large areas of land at present producing very indifferent cereal crops and well suited to grape-growing, are planted under vines. 3. An olive crushing Industry of appreciable dimensions can be developed in time if large areas of land, particularly in the North, now giving a poor return from cereal growing, are devoting to the much more profitable use of olive production, for which local conditions appear to be well suited. Some areas in the northern region of Arab Palestine afford admirable examples of the target at which to aim# 4 Any development programme for Transjordan should include a great expansion of fruit growing. Conditions are suitable for the production of a large number of fruits. To obtain the maximum returns from fruit growing, the establishment of a sound fruit preservation industry is essential. It will not only prepare canned and dried products from first class produce but will convert into jams, jellies, juices, squashes, etc., produce not up to standard for the fresh fruit market. It will also act as a safety valve and outlet for the disposal of fresh fruit in case of difficulties in marketing.&lt;r 2~* III# The Agricultural Department The functions and scope of the activities of the Department are too limited, if progress in agricultural development is to be made within a reasonable period of time. Expansion requires men, facilities and material. Without adequate financial provision these requirements cannot be provided. IV, Finances For a country so essentially agricultural as Transjordan, in which 85% of the ^population is engaged in agricultural activities and which has no other major industry, and ordinary annual expenditure which represents less than 1.5$ of the total budget expenditure of the Kingdom is inadequate if real progress of to be made. Even with the addition of the extraordinary expenditure this year the provision is still too low. The funds provided in 1947 in the adjoining country of Syria represented 4.44% of the total budget expenditure. The latter figures include forestry, which the Transjordan figure omits. 2. Transjordan should draw up a five-year programme of agricultural development. It should assign priorities in regard to agreed lines and should arrange for their finance according to an approved schedule. V. Staff One of the greatest needs is senior staff for research purposes. Research is indispensable to improvement. It alone can point the way to sound development. The barest minimum requirements are:- (a) An agronomist for field experimentation on improved methods of crop husbandry. (b) An horticulturist to deal with fruits and vegetables, in view of the importance of their development to the future prosperity of the country. (c) An economic botanist for the improvement of existing crops by breeding and selection and for the introduction of new crops. (d) A soil chemist. 2. The policy of sending abroad at State expense selected nationals for study of the sciences is particularly applicable to agriculture and should be implemented with all speed. Ail such trainees should be under contract to serve the Government for a specified number of years on their return. It Is important that they be employed in the sciences for which they have been trained. Too often it happens in M.B. countries that the services of local men similarly trained are utilised in Departments of Government where their specialised education is of no particular use and is wasted. 3. Full development and improvement cannot take place in a number of directions until research has pointed the way. If action to begin such research is left to await the return of the nationals sent abroad for study, progress will be delayed for at least 5 years. At least the first three posts suggested in para. 5 should be created now and filled by the early recruitment of suitably /qualified4 -3- qualified and experienced foreign specialists on contract for 5 years. During this period these officers will get the work their respective spheres started on sound lines. They will .w replaced in due course by the local men after they have gained sufficient experience on their return. 4. If suitably qualified and experienced staff of the former Palestine Agricultural Department are available either for research or for district extension work every effort should be made to secure the services of a number of them. VI* Facilities The appointment of research staff implies the provision of suitable and adequate facilities for their work. The chief request in this connexion is research laboratories and very early action is necessary to build, fit and equip such accommodation. 2. On this field side provision, particularly for the horticultural officer, is more satisfactory. Already a very solid foundation has been laid. The existing field stations cover a variety of climatic and soil conditions in the country and should provide adequate information as to possibilities of fruit growing, both irrigated and rainfed, under those conditions. 3* Facilities for agronomic experts are more limited and when intensive investigations embracing the many aspects of crop production are undertaken additional land in representative tracts and covering different conditions will be needed. The economic botanist also will require land at his disposal. The Jebaiha, El Qasr and Mazar farms will meet part of these needs. VII. Agricultural education Since the needs of Transjordan for agricultural education of University standard are too small to warrant contemplation of making provision to meet them locally, the policy of sending selected students for foreign study of this nature should be continued. 2* The specialised training required in subordinate staff can be adequately provided at the Khadoorie Agricultural School Tulkarm, if the part of Arab Palestine now attached to Transjordan remained absorbed in it. It would be wasteful and is unnecessary to provide another centre in Transjordan itself so long as the Tulkarm facilities are available. 3, Tulkarm should also cater for short courses of instruction which may be required by the public in specialised aspects of agriculture and animal husbandry.4. r -4- 4» If the present Arab-Israeli houndary at Tulkarm becomes W permanent, it may be necessary to provide it with additional arable land in replacement of the area which it has lost through the fixing of the boundary on its present site. VIII. School s The provision of school gardens for all rural primary schools should be accelerated. Practical demonstration is an essential aspect of the teaching of agriculture and nature study in these schools, and for it such gardens are needed. 2. All teachers of agriculture and nature study should themselves have been trained in these studies. The best arrangement probably will be to institute a special one year’s teachers training course for the purpose at Tulkarm. 3. It is likely to prove advantageous and helpful to agricultural teachers in rural primary schools if the local District Agricultural Officer, when on tour in the neighbourhood, should visit schools which possess gardens, to give advice and guidance in their management and, if necessary, to assist in the procurement of such materials as may be required. IX. Crop husbandry Some improvements in agricultural practices can be suggested immediately: others will depend on the results of research which must first be carried out. 2. Over many parts of the country production suffers through inadequate cultivation and the presence of an excess of harmful weeds. The indigenous plough is ill-suited to good cultivation on weedy soil. A simple but much superior implement is a miniature mouldboard, plough which is used in some Eastern countries and is known as the ’’Meston” plough. It is well within the strength of the poorest draft animals. Its iron parts are manufactured by the British firm of Ransomes Sons and Jeffries, and cost only a few shillings: the pole which attaches the plough to the draft animals is made and fitted locally. It is suggested that a few Meston ploughs be obtained and their advantages in this connection be tried out. 3, Better use of irrigation supplies, where they exist, can oe made in several directions. (a) the prevention of waste, (b) the avoidance of the use of excessive quantities, (c) the spread of supplies over larger areas, (d) the concentration of irrigation on the production of intensive and highly-paying field, fruit and vegetable crops, and the relegation of cereals to which irrigation is now applied, to rainfed lands.12 -5- 4» Ghornical fortiliscrs find little place in agricultural practice at present. There is insufficient knowledge either s-£&gt;f economics of their use or of the individual fertilisers or - ^nibinations of f' rtilisers 'best suited to individual orchard and field crops under Transjordan conditions or of the optimum quantities to apply. Possibly the scope of fertilisers and the improvement which their use can effect under the low rainfall conditions which prevail over much of tho country may be very restricted but the whole subject needs full investigation by a qualified agronomist. 5# Information is needed on a variety of other matters such as crop rotations, seed rates, whether a particular crop should be grown on the flat or on ridges, the optimum spacing between rows, etc., etc. All these await attention by the agronomist. 6* On the botanical seed improvement of existing crops in regard to yield and quality is needed. Breeding and selection by a qualified botanist are called for. A very important requirement in view of the low rainfall is resistance to drought and any improvement that can be introduced in this connection will be of the utmost value. 7# The suitability of local conditions for crops not at present grown requires examination, fflhe rape, known as Tara mira, might be suitable as a winter oil seed crop in the areas of lower rainfall: castor appears to do well at the Baqura nursery and might suitably be planted on the borders of fields in the valleys and elsewhere. Once it is well established in the ground this plant does not usually require irrigation in other eastern countries with low rainfall. Sugar-cane should suit conditions in tho Jordan Volley but whether the area which could be grown in view of the amount of irrigation which this crop requires, and the extent of the land and irrigation available, would make the crop worthwhile would need consideration. 8. An all-out effort should be made to convert the Jordan Valley from a cereal producing area to region which specialises in highly- paying fruits, vegetables and other intensive crops such as tobacco and sugarcane insofar as the irrigation supply will permit. If and when the major project for the irrigation of the valley by the waters of the Jordan and Yarmouk should materialise, the conversion should bee one absolute. 9. For the full development of the Jordan Valley the provision of an all-weather road through it is an essential. 10. There are many areas in the country where soil and other conditions are better suited to fruit grov/ing than to the cereal production which is their main feature. In the North, a large expansion of fruit growing, particularly olives, should take place. Elsewhere too, wherever conditions are known to be favourable, fruit growing should be expanded. 11. Parts of the country are well suited to grape production and a considerable increase in the area under vines is desirable, provided adequate steps are first taken to control Phylloxera. It is essential to bring this disease under control if grape production is to assume the role in agricultural production which local conditions .warrant.-6- 12. The production of citrus fruits at present is negligible. It was stated that this situation is not altogether fortuitous as &lt; it was not desired to compete with Palestine. That consicLp^*— ation may no longer hold good and in any case it seems desirable to take advantage of the early climate of the Jordan Valley by extending citrus and banana cultivation. 13. The possibility of growing date palms in the Azraq area seems well worth investigation. 14. If the large expansion in fruit growing which seems likely to be an important aspect of agricultural development is to become a reality, great numbers of fruit - nursery plants will be required. It is important that only the best varieties should be planted, and cultivators must look to the Agricultural Department for supplies. It is said tha.t the departmental nurseries cannot meet even the present demand, and it is obvious that nursery plant production must be greatly increased. There would bo little point in undertaking an all-out campaign to induce cultivators to change over from a cereal to a fruit growing economy unless the necessary supplies, materials and services were available. 15. The department should also increase considerably the quantities of improved seeds which it grows and issues, particularly when the economic botanist is appointed and produces them. In this connection the present system whereby the Department issues such seed to cultivators on the basis of payment in kind at harvest time, requires careful watching. Experience of a similar system elsewhere showed that, due to inadequate protection by the cultivator, the seed v/hich he supplied in repayment was often quite unsuitable for further issue. 16. The Shera is an inhospitable tract of country. Cereal growing, supported by a measure of livestock keeping, would seem to offer a precarious existence. It would be desirable to ascertain by trial whether it is possible to establish any kinds of fruit’ on the high land under rainfed conditions, and whether they can succeed. (in the lower valleys of this region a number of fruits grow successfully under irrigation). 17. The proposed water tanks in the grazing areas as sources of drinking water for livestock will be a boon, provided they catch and hold an appreciable volume of run-off rain water for a reasonable time. 18. Enquiries will be instituted as to the possibilities of improving the quality of the grass in some of the main grazing . areas with a view to making practical trials if there is any prospect of success under the climatic conditions which maintain. 19. Emphasis was laid on many parts of the country on the absolute need of adequate measures to protect from the depredations of nomads and the losses which occur through the scant respect for private property, particularly when the product is new or rare in the region. This, of course, is a matter for the oivil administration. X. Refugees7' X* Refugee s • Transjordan does not offer roady made facilities on a ^cale of any magnitude for the rapid settlement of refugees. 2 0 It has been rightly concluded by the local authorities that unoccupied land for rainfed cultivation exists nowhere but in the Shara, an unattractive stretch of country with a precarious rainfall, capable- of producing on present limited showing, only the poorest cereal crops, but wholly inadequately explored, 3, Local. authorities have also rightly summed up the only possibilities of settlement under irrigated farming. With the exception of the Azraq depression -they are confined to the Jordan Valley. Here the only short torm facilities lie in the possible development of the 'Zor', a long narrow strip of land adjoining the river, but requiring scrub-clearing, levelling, protection from floods and irrigation by pumping from the river, before it is capable of use. According to present estimates the cost would bo high - very roughly L.P.93,000 - the area finally provided amounting to only 1,300 acres and sufficing.for the settlement of just over 1,000 pesous. 4» In regard to the Azraq depression, irrigation, drainage and soil conditions require examination and appraisal before its possibilities for agricultural development can be determined. If these conditions prove to be favourable the capacity for absorbing refugees have been estimated provisionally by local authorities at 10,000 persons. 5 , On a long-term basis the Jordan Valley alone holds out possibilities of settlement in Transjordan on an appreciable scale but the obstacles to be surmounted are such that it would be unsafe at present to base great expectations on tho project. The c'kief of these obstacles are:- (a) The construction of a major irrigation project of which the inclusive cost is thought to exceed L.P. 14 millions. (b) A settlement with Palestine and other adjoining countries as to the distribution of the waters of the rivers Jordan and Yarmuk** (o) The expropriation by Government of present owners of the land in the Jordan Valley and the redistribution of the area on a small holding basis of 25 dunums each (5»75 acres) between present owners and new settlers. 6 # If and when all these difficulties are surmounted and the construction has been completed, the total irrigateland inclusive of that supplied by tho Wadis to the East, will bo 300,000 dunums capable of providing land for 8,000 to 10,000 families, or 40,000 to 50,000 persons, according to the estimates of Mr.Ionides. Some of this number would consist of cultivators already-8- already on the spot, thus reducing the number of new settlers, but possibly this loss would be made good by the additional settlers who would be required to perform subsidiary services and functions in the Oolony. 7* The only remaining possibility in this region would appear to be associated with tho largo area now developed mainly to grass in the Ghor el Kabid and Ghbr! Mmoin in the neighbourhood of the-Wadi Shaeb, Mr.lonides* report that surface water conditions are favourable suggests the desirability jf developing this area by tube well irrigation, if the land can be,made available for the purpose. All cultivable land in the dry-farming regions of Arab Palestine appears to the outsider to be so entirely cultivated at present that there can be few possibilities of finding unoccupied cultivable land for additional settlers* Whether this country can contribute at all to refugee resettlement on the land seems doubtful and possibilities appear to lie only in Musa Bey Alami’s project to irrigate certain undeveloped areas by pumping from the Jordan* As observed elsewhere, this scheme requires technical examination from the engineering and soil aspects before any authoritative opinion is possible. Looked at superficially in the absence of these surveys tho impression is formed that the &gt; provision of an adequate irrigation supply to this land will be difficult and expensive. Arab Palestine The chief matters requiring early attention in this area arot- (a) the provision of finances to enable the staff which is' still functioning to carry on essential work, even if it should be on no more than a care and maintenance basis, (b) a decision as to the future of the staff, (o) the resumption of the Khadoor.ie Agricultural School, Tulkarm, of the functions for which it was established and the provision of funds to enable it to perform those functions. (d) the resumption of Jericho Horticultural Station under the direct control and management of the Agricultural Department.( THE DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY 1 S*GOVERNMENT ) SECRET CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST MIDDLE EAST OIL Note by the Joint Secretaries We circulate herewith, for the information of the Committee, a Paper on Middle East Oil (M.E.(O)W.P.5) which has been prepared by the Committee’s Working Party and to which reference was made in paragraph 2 of M.E.

MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE WORKING PARTY ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST MIDDLE EAST OIL The Middle East is an increasingly important source of supply of crude petroleum and refined products to the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the countries participating in the European Recovery Programme. In additon sales for hard currencies are a most valuable contribution to the economy -of the United Kingdom. 2. There are three outstanding features in the Middle East oil situation: (A) The vastly expanded importance to the world economy of the Middle East where over half th$ world’s proved oil reserve are located, which supplies 12$ of world production and which is expected to supply 25$ by 1956. (B) The.anticipated three-fold rise by 1956 in Middle East oil production which has already risen three-fold in the past decade. (C) The large interest of British companies (and His Majesty’s Government which has a controlling interest in the Angjo- Iranian Oil Company) producing over one-* ha If of total Middle East output. 3.

Cabinet Office, S.W.l 20th June, 1949.- 1 - SYRIA INTRODUCTION Tb.e natural resources of Syria are such that agriculture is and will continue to be the basis of her economy. A prosperous and progressive agriculture must therefore be the cardinal aim of any plan for Syria’s economic development. Agriculture provides a livelihood for two thirds of the population. It produces the basic raw materials for Syria's industries. Its products form the major part of Syria's export trade and provide the foods that maintain the health and well-being of the people. Syria's water resources represent an untapped source of wealth which, if turned to account, could play a very big part in the economic prosperity of the country. In the Jezira, lying in the North-East between the Euphrates and the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers, Syria possesses an area of out standing development possibilities, both for rain-fed and irrigated agriculture, ranking with the Gedaref district of the Sudan, the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in Iraq, and the Karun in Khuzistan. The total cultivable lands of Syria would however require for their exploitation a rural population of nearly 5 millions, or more than double the present agricultural population. There is therefore in Syria as a whole, and in the Jezira in particular, a unique opportunity for settlement and development. Meanwhile, within her borders and in nearby countries, some hundreds of thousands of workless and landless Palestinian Arab refugees are herded in camps, subsisting on relief, to which the United Kingdom and the United States Governments have been the principal contributors. Substantial outside assistance will be required for any large-scale scheme for the resettlement of / /the-.SSStes*™* 2 .- the refugees, and the practical, political, economic and social difficulties are not to be underestimated. But the plight of the refugees presents an opportunity which Syria might well turn to good account. ^ 2 * POLITICAL Syrici, like other Arab States, v&gt;/as left in a state of demoralisation and impoverishment by the Palestine war. Her impoverishment was aggravated by the burden of the refugees and by mismanagment of her finances. The stage was set for the emergence ol some new force to assume leadership. Little was known of Husni el 2aim at the time of the • Le is a Lurd and has made his career in the Army. His was carried out with surprising speed and efficiency but, whilst he secured a vote of confidence from a little over hall the Chamber of Deputies, it was only with great difficulty that., he succeeded in persuading any of its members to form a (j-overnment with him. His Government was recognised by the United States, Prance and ourselves on 27th April. Zaim has stated that he does not propose to alter the foreign policy of his predecessor and that his first objectives, alter an armistice with Israel, are the composing of the dillerences with the Lebanon and the enecrragement of foreign capital investment for the cono^uc+ion of pipe lines. He has now signed a letTi ^ + 'i ve decree ratifying the Franco-Syrian More tar,, ^o*.; -'d on negotiated by the previous Government. The agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company was ratified on 18th May and Zaim has made it known that he hopes shortly to sign the proposed agreement with the Middle East Pipe-line Company and to come to terms with the Iraq Petroleum Company in regard to their proposed pipe line and the terminal on the Syrian coast. In the past we have had to be careful not to press the /Syrians- 3 - Syrians too strongly to accept British advice for fear of offending French susceptibilities. x'his consideration has however now almost ceased to apply. The Syrian Government employed a British firm (Sir Alexander Gibb and rartners) in 1946 to mcdse an economic survey of the country. In the same y^ar they engaged a British expert to review their system of taxation system, and they also employed several American agricultural experts. Reports have been made to the Syrian Government by the Agricultural, Health, Labour, Forestry and Soil Conservation, and Statistical Advisers of the British Middle Bast Office. Early this year an. unofficial Syrian envoy visited London to enquire about possible military and economic aid from this country while a request has been made for British matrons and nurses for appointment in Syrian hospitals. French influence in the Syrian educational system has now virtually disappeared and there are no longer any Frenchmen employed in any of the. University faculties or Government secondary schools. There is a possibility that the present Vice-President of the American University at Beirut may be appointed Rector of the University at Damascus and that teaching in most Faculties will henceforth he conducted in English. 3. POPULATION , The population of Syria ^as estimated in 1944. at 2,901,000 of whom 71.5 % were classified as rural. The non- sedentary population consisted at that date of about 150,000 nomads and.about 150,000 semi-sedentary persons, bringing the total up to about 3,201,000. The rate of population increase is 22 % and the estimated total population in 1954 is 3 , 625 , 000 . 4. AREA The total area of Syria is about 57,000 square miles (or about 37 million acres), of which about 15 % (or 5.5 million acres) is at present under cultivation. About one third of the cultivated area is normally allowed to lie fallow each year. Approximately 13 % of the 5.5 million acres of cultivated land is irrigated.- u - 5. A GRICULTURE Syria’s rural population is insuff'icient to worR al-^ the arable lands. Less than half the area potentially cultivable is now under cultivation. In order to achieve full cultivation, with the present system of agriculture, more than twice the present population would be needed. In the Jesira and the Euphrates Valley especially, rich lands remain undeveloped for lack of labour. Syria is well endowed with natural. v/ater supplies. The Euphrates and its major tributary, the Khabur, water a large area in the East, whilst the Orontes is the largest of several rivers in the Rest. Except for pump schemes in the Jesira and the canal scheme which irrigates the Damascus oasis, little has been done to promote irrigation. Rainfall is limited over the entire country to the winter months (October - April) and the amount of rainfall is subject to considerable fluctuation. This dependence on fainfall results not only in marked fluctuations in the year- by-year productivity of agricultire but also restricts the range of crops. The extension of.irrigation is therefore of first importance. -The present irrigated area could be more than doubled, from 730,000 acres to about 1,300,000 acres. More-over, the yield per acre could be raised considerably through improvement in methods, techniques and the introduction of better animal breeds and plant varieties. Any improvement in agricultural technique will depend first of all, however on the expansion and overhaul of agricultural education. ( a ) Irr i gation The areas available for irrigation development are:- 6 - To sum up agricultural development can be on two broad lines: (i) the more eificient use of the land at present under cultivation, by means of irrigation, the use ,of ' fertilisers, the improvement of cultivation practices,etc. (ii) the extension of cultivation to land at present waste but cultivable, and by the reclamation of land, preferably in areas suitable for mechanical cultivation (like the Jezira, the Western regions of Home, and Hama and the Mohafazat of uleppo) and having an adequate rainfall. . But the construction of all-weather communications must proceed parallel with land utilisation, so that the produce may be quickly and cheaply transported to the markets. ( c ) Cadastral Survev_an£_Lnnd Settlemen t. iin essential preliminary to all development is the accurate surveying and mapping of the country. While a great deal has already been done, much of the country requires re surveying, while some of the rich lands are only partially mapped. In particular, considerable work remains to be done on the Cadastral Survey without which many improvements in farming methods and mechanised farming will be difficult to achieve and the completion of certain development schemes, e.g. irrigation projects, will be seriously delayed. Barly steps should therefore be taken to review existing legislation with a view to facilitating and speeding the settlement of ownership disputes and the completion of the Cadastral Survey should be given a high priority. (d) Land Tenure The familiar evils of share-cropping, absentee landlordism and strip-farming are to be found in Syria. There is also, in the Eastern parts of the country, periodical reallotment, which offers/- 7 - offers no inducement to development and encourages land abuse, A reform of the system of land tenure and of the ownership of water-rights will have to. be devised if the farmer is to free himself from his financial thraldom to the landowner and the merchant, (e) Farming capital One of the most serious obstacles to the small farmer’s advancement is the lack of facilities for obtaining shortterm capital at-a cheap rate. An extension of the loaning powers of the Agricultural Bank would help. But, if the vast majority of the small farmers are to emerge from their chronic state of indebtedness, the best solution might be found in the formation of Village Cooperative Credit Societies, such as have been set up in Cyprus and elsewhere. (f) Cooperatives '• Such a system, besides providing the farmer with credit, call be extended to perform other functions, such as the collective supplying of the farmer’s material needs and the pooling and marketing, of his produce. (g) Marketing Boards In order to achieve standardisation of produce and the better development of markets, as well as to encourage new varieties and the use of improved methods, Marketing Boards nay ultlmatoly prove to be useful, particularly in regard to fruit i , and vegetable produce. (h) Agricultural Machinery The farmer would be greatly helped too by the formation • ’ 1 - - * 'ii of organisations on cooperative lines for the purchase, operation and maintenance of agricultural machinery. Customs returns show . .* ■ ■ : •• •. e •*.. t, l that the number of agricultural machines imported in 1948 to be double the number existing in 1947. Prospects for 1949 are that still larger numbers will be imported.- 8 - The Syrian Government are V alive to the need Tor reforms and improvements on the above lines hut whether any effective action will he taken remains to he seen, iiccording to a recent unconfirmed report, the Zaim Government has issued a decree directing that a Committee ho set up to reconsider the Syrian State Laws and Regulations concerning State land and to ‘propose whatever reforms are required 'in order to conform with world social and economic evolution' and to fulfil the following aims (a) to limit and restrict the right to land ov/nership in the general interest in accordance with the principles of social justice; (b) . to lay the foundations for a distribution of State land among small peasants and workers said pensioned military and civil employees; . -;(c) to draw up a system for a limited agricultural land company to guarantee State rights and evolve a plan for cooperative farms, (i) Crons - . Cereals (which form tho basic diet of the people) constitute almost a monopoly among field crops and occupy an area approaching 3,500,000 out of a total annual acreage of loss than 4,000*000 acres under general field crops, Amongst cereals themselves, wheat accounts for more than 2 f 000,t)00 acres and harle'y for nearly 1,000,000-, The wheat yield per acre compares favourably with that of the main producing countries of the world, but the same is not true of prices. In 1S48 the price of Syrian wheat was £44 a ton (or £50 a ton at the border)while the world wheat price this summer la expected to bo about £24 a ton c, and f. Beirut. (j) Wheat Office The Government grain collecting and distributing ' organisation/organisation (MIRA) is to.T^e liquidated on the 15th July next. In its stead the Government propose to establish a Wheat Qffice whose functions will be:- (i) to control prices with a vi;w to bringing them more in line with world wheat prices; (ii) to curb speculation and profiteering; (iii) to ensure adequate supplies to cover local requirements; (iv) to assist farmers, especially those in the Jezira area, in disposing of their crops at reasonable prices; (v) to control wheat exports. The proposal to set up a Wheat Office is a move in the right direction. Should farm labour be available and communications be extended, any expansion in cereal production will also however have to take into account the need for silos for grain storage. (k) Rice Production of rice is comparatively unimportant but has gono up considerably in Syria in the - :- - last few years. The tonnage produced in 1947 (21,500 tons) was seven times greater than that produced in 1939, while imports over the same period have been reduced by almost 80/'b. The Jezira is the main area of production but rice has recently been cultivated more extensively in the Mzerib area of the Hauran and in the Acharne region of the province of Hama. With the extension of irrigation there is no reason why Syria’s output should not increase still further, at least to cover her own and the Lebanon's requirements. Care would have to be taken however to reduce the attendant risks of malaria to a minimum# (l) C otton The requirements of Syria’s spinning mills are more than met by present production. New mills are however being built which will raise the total requirements in ginned cotton to over 20,000 tons a year. Increased local cultivation of cotton will therefore be desirable, especially in irrigated lands, which produce a higher and/- 10 - and more uniform yield* The most suitable areas might he the Euphrates Valley and the Jezira, the Orontes Valley and the G-hab region. Other possible areas are the lands to be irrigated b^the Aleppo Water Scheme and the Mzerib irrigation scheme*. ( m ) Olive Oil and other Edible Oils At present, olive oil production is barely sufficient for internal requirements, for human consumption and soap-manufacture* There are large areas of non-irrigable land suitable for the cultivation of the olive tree and increased cultivation could provide for Syria’s own needs as well as for a substantial export trade* But prior research and experimental work in the use of fertilisers, the planting of improved varieties and the more scientific terracing of the land would be necessary. There are certain promising areas for the cultivation of ground-nutes (e.g. the Euphrates Valley, the Latakia district and the Jezira). A project (which has been examined by the Agricultural adviser to the - British Middle East Office, and for which 40-50 h.p. track tractors would be required) is now being studied by the interested Bepartments in London* (n) Fruit The growing of fruit presents very considerable possibilities for Syria. The- principal fruits are figs and apricots but the diversity of soil and climate make a wider range possible. Sales abroad v/ould be increased if better quality were achieved and better marketing methods introduced there would be excellent opportunities for the canning and preserving industry. (o) Vegetables Similar opporunities exist for vegetable cultivation. Suitable areas would be the province of Latakia, the -Orontes Valley, the Lake Tiberias district, the Jezira and the Euphrates Valley. 6. LIVESTOCKS Sheep in Syria form a valuable asset to the country. The outnumber all other types of livestock. In the export market, of first importance is the wool at present being sold to the United States. /A11 research station and demonstration farms v/ould he desirable. 7. FOKESTS The forests of Syria have suffered, like the forests of other parts of the Mediterranean region, from ruthless exploitation and the uncontrolled introduction of large herds of sheep and goats, Imports of wood are estimated at about 476,000 cubic metres annually and annual charcoal requirements are 40,000 tons. The demand is unsatisfied and forest reserves cannot provide what is required on a replacement basis, at present, Keafforestation of very considerable areas would confer great benefit on the country by supplying timber and fuel, reducing erosion and conserving water supplies. The main present need ia natural regeneration to prevent soil erosion. The forests include evergreen and deciduous oak, stone pine, Aleppo pine, cypress and juniper and the montane typos, a considerable number of fruit-trees exist, both wild and in cultivation. The maintenance and extension of the forests depends on afforestation and the establishment of a forest police, Syria reformed its Forest Code in 1955, but little effective action was taken until 19o8, when tv/o divisions of forest police were established, one in the North and the other in the South, The present Director of Forests has made wide acquisitions of reserves and created a better Forest Department. But reservation has gone too fast for public opinion and the need is now to expand the Department, consolidate what has been gained, obtain more effective protection for natural regeneration and then launch into larger afforestation schemes.8 MINERALS. 1 o Syria f s known mineral resources cannot Le depended upon to play more than a very small part in the country^ economic development and the absence of important minerals, such as iron and coal, make the creation of any heavy industries impossible at present. The only metallic minerals which occur in small quantities are chromite, manganese ore* The only non-metallic minerals are salt, asphalt asbestos and building stone* 9* OIL. The geological similarity of certain parts of Syria to neighbouring oi-l'-producing countries suggests that there may be oil deposits in Syria* Test borings by the Syrian Petroleum Company have so far however produced no results. Borings are continuing in the North-East.a 10. PIPE-LINES, T The I.P.Co pipe-line from Kirkuk to Tripoli passes through Syrian territory. Plans have been made (although the Syrian Government f s•agreement has not yet been secured) for the doublings of this pipe-line and for the construction of a new terminal on the Syrian coast, probably at Banias. The estimated cost is £33 million plus ?&gt;42 million. The ’ . completion date is expected to be 1953* Meanwhile an agreement has been drawn'up for the laying of a pipe-line (Middle East Pipe-Line Company) which will run from ^L*h-’’Rst Persia to a terminal on the Syrian Coast, probably at Tartuo. The estimated cost of £35 million plus ,0100 million, the expected .pietion date being 1952# An agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipe-Line Company for the laying of a pipe-line (from. Dhahran to the Lebanese Coast) through Syrian territory was ratified on May 18th. All these works should be of considerable assistanceto the econorny of Syria, in providing employment, currency and an easing of the oil supply position* 11. COMMUNICATIONS * The 'coordination of road, rail and port development in Syria requires further careful investigation. (a) R oads Except for the- remote and undeveloped areas, particularly the Jezira, road communications are generally adequate and no large programme oi road consti’uction is necessary. At present a major diliiculty is rather the maintenance of the existing road system. ^.n estimate of road construction required in opening up the agri cultural lands of the Euphrates Valley and the Jesira, together with an analysis of costs, is given in Annex a, paragraphs 10 and 11. (b) Railways The railway system does not serve the best interests country. The Southern regions, including Damascus, have no through rail connexion with *JLeppo and the North. The rail link between the West and the largo and potentially rich lands of the North-East and Iraq passes through Turkey* There are suggestions therefore for a direct link with Bagdad, to which the Iraqis have agreed in principle* The route might be via Homs— Palmyra—Abou Kemal, with a new direct line from Homs to Damascus. Such .a line would be uneconomic* To serve the rich Jezira, a. line farther North, from Aleppo via Raqqa to Deir-ez-Zor, would be necessary The Gibb Report recommended idle following programme of railway development: First Stage - (a) Damascus-Homs (200 kms. ) Detailed investigations end execution. (Such a line coulu hardly be justified on purely economic grounds)# (b) Aleppo-La takia (220 kms.) Detailed investigations, depending . . on the decision to develop the port of Latakia (see below) (c) Aleppo—R.aqqa (200 kms*) Detailed investigations* /Second Stage^ 14 - Second Stacco (d) Aleppo-Raqqa ilxycution.

All the above capital costs include the cost of locomotives and rolling stock* Detailed surveys of alignment are estimated at about £S 500 per km. The cost of imported material would be approximately 50^7 of the total. Import re quirements would include probably 135 , 000 . tons of steel rail and 1^- million sleepers. ■ An estimate of railway development to. servo the Euphrates Valley and the Jezira is given in Annex A, paragraphs 13-17. (c) Civil Aviation , but Only Air-Prance served, the Levant. States before the war other foreign lines arc now also well established, 'among them Pan—American World Airways, which. a1one maintains a the-world service via Damascus ment concluded in April, 1947, extended to other foreign lines • . Under an international granting rights not yet , Pan-American are also round~ agree- entitled to pick up and discharge international traffic at Damascus, In 1946 it organised and' staffed a local company, Syrian Airways, which was taken over by the Government, for military purposes, in 1948. -It has not so far been ' /demilitarised.demilitarised. - 15 *• (§a) 0^ Meanwhile plans have been drawn up for the con struction of an international airport at Mezze, near Damascus, the cost of which, at a rough estimate, might ^i amount to £3 million. (d) P orts . The natural outlets to the sea for Syrian trade are Iskendemn (Alexandretta), Beirut and Tripoli. . While these three ports were under French Mandate there was no need to consider development of other ports. The cession of Iskenderun to Turkey in 1939 concentrated Syrian trade through Beirut which, with Tripoli, in 1945 became a Lebanese port. Syria now lacks a deep-water harbour and there are no places on the Syrian coast entirely suitable for port development. Posibilities are Latakia (to serve the North) and Tartus or Banias (for central Syria). Traffic centred on Damascus would continue to use Beirut. Latakia possesses the best existing facilities, though for lighters and small craft only. Plans have been made to provide \ alongside berths, warehousing facilities and other amenities. The reasons for development of a purely Syrian port at Latakia or elsewhere are mainly political. Beirut and Tripoli could continue to handle present Syrian trade wi-th no difficulty and both have free zones. Meanwhile there are pro posals for new ports at Tartus (Middle East Pipe-Line) and Banias (l.P.C.) as pipe-line terminals. Cargo handling facilities are believed to be included in the port plans of the Oil Companies and the Syrian Government might well profit by co-ordinating its own port development schemes with those of the Oil Companies* (e) Te lecommunic ati on s. A contract between the Syrian authorities and the Standard Telephone Company was signed in January, 1948, the total value of which was in the neighbourhood of £1,200,000 and which provided for the installation Of automatic tele phone exchanges at Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama and Latakia, /and the supolyand the supply of instruments and associated equipment. In addition, an extensive network of carrier derived circuits on open wire lines and international trunk outlets were to be installed. Two radio broadcastinfa 1 stations were also to be n&gt; installed at Sabboura and Saraqeb which would be fed from new studios from Damascus for the fitting out of which the Company had also obtained the contract. This contract was obtained in the face of fierce competition from the Ericsson Company of Sweden. It was necessary for the company to sub contract for automatic exchange equipment to a Belgian sub~ sidiary owing to the fact that the type of gear required was not manufactured or otherwise obtainable in this country. In due course sanction was obtained for the expenditure of £500,000 in Belgium. The present position is that it is hoped to open the Damascus exchange this November, followed by the others as the work is completed. As regards the broadcasting stations, matters are alsfc well advanced and a number of Syrian officials including the Technical Director and Assistant Technical Director of Broadcasting are at present under training in England at the Company’s establishment. 12. INDUSTRY AND POW ER Syria’s economy having always been based on agriculture, her industries were confined until recently to handicrafts and domestic systems of manufacture. Industrial development is limited, apart from the lack of skilled technicians and labour, by the lack of minerals, particularly coal and iron, and of cheap fuel and power. Advances have however been made in the development of light industries, the most important of which is the textile industry, including cotton and silk spinning, cotton, rayon and silk weaving. /(a) Power.17 - (a) P ower . One of the obstacles to greater industrial efficiency 'i and to a reduction in costs is the irregular, frequently inadequate, and uniformly expensive supply of electric power# Laclt of cheap power is also a deterrent to increased industrial mechanisation. Apart from industry, there is need for a more widespread use of electricity in the home* At present only a small proportion of the country benefits from electricity, which could play an important part in raising the general standard of living. Also, in certain circumstances, agriculture could use cheap supplies of electric power to advantage, in particular for irrigation pumps. The principal sources of power for hydro generation - the Euphrates, the Orontes and the Yarmuk, may have a total potential power of over 126,000 kw. It will be a number of years before demand reaches this figure. 30,000 kw. could be derived from the minimum flow of the Euphrates alone. With water conservation, 100,000 kw. or more might be developed. The possibilities of the combination of hydro-electric development and water conservation in the Euphrates Valley .are of special interest to Syria. Much will depend however on the outcome of the projected electrification schemes in the Lebanon, which could no doubt be used to supply Syria also with increased electric power. The Gibb Report recommended that the capacity of the plants at Aleppo and Damascus should be doubled by about 1952, particularly to meet growing‘industrial and agricultural needs. ( 10 ) Co tt on Spinnin g The estimated output of cotton yarn in 1947 -was 1000 tons. Plans have been made for the qrection of more mills, which will have a total estimate output of over 10,000 tons a year. The output of raw cotton is sufficient at present to meet current requirements of the mills but very large quantities will have to be imported later. /(c) W eavi ng.r «r (c) Weaving. The weaving and kriitting industry, based on Damascus, Aleppo and Homs, produced in 1947 over 10,000 tons of cloth* Hand-looms still accounted for a high proportion of the total output. industry’s annual requirements of yarn were then estimated at 12,000 tons. Syrian spinning costs are still about 2 or 3 times greater ■ 1 •' * &gt; 4 than United Kingdom'costs and greater efficiency in production, including increased mechanisation, will be needed both in spinning and weaving to compete with foreign textiles. Other Middle Bast countries are expanding their textile industries and export possibilities are therefore decreasing. (d) Cement . Cement required by the Syrian market is supplied from factories at Dummar, near Damascus, and from Tripoli in the Lebanon. - The Dummar factory’s output in 1948 was 50&gt;000 tons, while the factory at Tripoli produced 200,000 tons. Their capacity is insufficient to meet the needs of Syria and the Lebanon, especially for any expansion in public works. A third factory is now being built in the Aleppo area, where it will be well situated as regards communications and will eventually be able to supply the requirements of such areas as the Jezira*and the Euphrates Valley. Present prices are £S 100 per ton, as against import prices of £S 66 c.i.f. (e) Sugar . A sugar factory was erected last year at Homs. It began manufacture this year of sugar from sugar beet. In full production it is considered capable of supplying one quarter or one third of Syria’s sugar requirements but the area of sugar beet at present grown is insufficient to keep the factory at full capacity. Beet is to be imported from Iraq and cane from Egypt. The factory is also to produce various chemical derivatives of sugar, e.g. glucose, alcohol,etc. 13* HEALTH . The medical services in Syria, which is remarkably free from endemic diseases except for a little mild malaria in the rural areas, are of a low standard owing to the inadequate training at the medical schools, the shortage of /doct orsdoctors -and lack of organisation. Thoro is at present only one British-.rueclfica 1 advisor, an expert in surgery, at the Ministry-of .Health in Damascus, but Dr.Jabi, the newly- appointed Director-General of the Ministry of Health (who visited' the United Kingdom undor British Council auspices last year and -who.has a high reputation for efficiency) has now made a request for British matrons and nurses for appointment to Government hospitals. It is hoped that this modest beginning may load to the adoption in Syria of British medical practice and a visit to Syria by the Health Adviser of the British Middle East Office is being arranged. The former Health Adviser to the B.M.E.O. recommended the appointment of foreign professors of preventive medicine, medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pathology, physiology and anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine at Damascus. 14* WATER SUPPLY . In addition to providing water for irrigation, the water resources of Syria are also needed for domestic use in hoth urban and rural areas. In the rural areas much needs to be done which will have to he spread over a period of many years. The first consideration should bo given to those.areas which suffer from perennial shortages, in particular the Jebel Druze, the Hauran and parts of the Aleppo and Homs regions. In order to make the most economical use of the limited supplies available, in these areas, overall plans will be re quired for each area. A programme of suggested development is contained in Annex B, paragraph (c). 15* LABOUR Conditions of employment, Trade Unions, Workmen’s Compensation, trades disputes procedure, etc., are prescribed in the current Labour Law introduced in 1946. It is impressive ly comprehensive. Its provisions are based largely upon I.L.O. /‘p pvg lu t i o n s- 20 - resolutions and for. tho most part have been used as standards to be reached rather than statutory requirements to be legally observed by all concerned. Inconsistency of enforcement by the administration creates anomalies. Large employers (e.g, the I.P.C.) are watched closely; the mass of small firms receive little or no attention. Machinery to apply the Law has boon created, e.g. Directorate of Labour, Labour Offices, Labour Inspectors. It is manifestly inadequate,.due to insufficiency of staff, inexperience, superficial understanding of the implications of the Law and lack of social responsibility. The officials however appear eager and willing to broaden their knowledge and to receive advice. Judged by Middle iCastern standards, the Trade Unions are v/ell organised. ^ National Federation exists (the ♦ . . . General Union of Syrian Labour Syndicates). It is anti- a Communist and claims to represent two-thirds of the Syrian a • \ Trade Unionists. Its leaders are recognised as capable, constructive and reasonable representatives of workers’ interests. Their relations with the former Government were cooperative; the present military-led Government’s anti communist policy is supported by the Federation. Planned . . industrial developments (oil pipe-lines and the proposed refinery at Tartus, textiles, etc.) and agricultural projects are expected to absorb most of the unemployed (reckoned by the local-Trade Unions, in the absence of official statistics, at about 50 ) 000 ) and to offer employment for the under employed.21 V v3 16. FINANCE Under the French Mandate Syria and the Lebanon formed one economic (but not political) unit and had a currency backed by the franc. In March, 1948* as a result of a prolonged dispute on the revaluation of Syria holdings of French francs in the event of the devaluation of the franc, Syria (but not the Lebanon) left the French franc area, divorced her currency from that of the Lebanon and set up a separate Foreign Exchange Office. A Franco-Syrian Agreement recently concluded provides for the settlement of Syria 1 s claim oh the 10 milliard of francs previously forming the currency cover. Of this total, 7 milliards, guaranteed in terms of sterling, is to be released in 14 half-yearly instalments. The remaining 3 milliards will be used partly to satisfy French counter-claims, partly for the purchase of certain European currencies (not including sterling or Belgian or Swiss francs) up to a limit of £375,000 over two years. Apart from these sums in French francs, Syria’s resources in foreign exchange are very small. Sterling holdings are of the order of £3,000,000 nearly all in private hands. An attempt made last year to introduce comparatively strict control over foreign exchange earnings broke down, mainly because Syrian merchants resorted to transacting business through the Lebanon where controls are very loose. Syria now operates virtually on a free market economy and in a very hand-to-mouth fashion. No recent trade figures and no information for Syria alone are available but it is certain that retained imports always greatly exceed exports and that Syria has always lived largely by the entrepot trade with Palestine, Iraq and Transjordan. /TheThe Syrian Government's royalties and other revenue from oil concessions will be insignificant during the next few years. It is estimated that revenues derived from the Middle East Pipeline, when completed, will amount only to about £ 300,000 a year. No figures are available in respect of the proposed I.P.C. Pipeline but it is likely that revenues will be lower than in the case of the Middle East Pipeline. Figures obtained from American sources suggest that revenues derived from the Trans-Arabian Pipeline will lniLixfc£20.QOO annually from transit taxes and £ 62,300 from 'export taxes'. Purchases of Syria.n pounds for local expenditure by British Companies will amount to about £ ij. million a year during the next few years but this figure will decrease sharply as soon as pipeline construction is completed. Moreover, the figure includes local expenditure by the Syrian Petroleum Company (paragraph 9 above) who will probably cease prospecting during the next year if no oil is found. The picture will .of course be changed in the event of the Syrian Petroleum Company striking oil. The internal financial position is shaky and there is marked inflation. The effect of this is well illustrated by the price of Syrian wheat (see paragraph 5 (i) above). It is obvious that the sale of Syria f s new season wheat surplus (estimated at 200,000 tons) will present difficulties, and that similar difficulties will recur until the prices of Syria f s exportable commodities come more or less into line with world's prices. 17# INTERNATIONAL BANK. While Syria is a member of the I.M.F. and of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development she has not so far sought the assistance of the Bank. 18. CENTRAL DEVELOPMENT ROAPn. In their Report to the Syrian Government in ‘1947 Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners urged the immediate formation of a Central Develop ment Board, the duties of which would be, in the first stage, advisory and, in the second, executive. They suggested that, in the first stage, the Board should study the recommendations for development contained in the Survey and report on them to the Government. In the second stage, the Board would become responsible for the detailed implementation of the plan for development decided /u-nonupon by the Government, In order to ensure that the Board had a status of v. permanency, with continuity of service and experience, it would have to be composed of a number of permanent Govemaant officials of the rank of Director-General (or permanant Head of Department) as well as a number of loading citisans* preferably not associated with politics., representing agricultural, industrial and commercial interests. liiarly this year, the then Minister of Public Works scught our advice about the setting up of a Central Development Board and His Majesty's Legation furnished him with information on the type of organisation, based on our experience in India, the Sudan and the Colonies, which might be best suited to Syria’s economic needs. On 16 th May, Zaim announced to a delegation of representatives from financial and economic institutions that he proposed to appoint an Economic Committee to lay down economic plans for the entire country. Among the plans which this Committee would consider would bo the schemu fur water supply for Aleppo and the contraction of a railway from interior t.) the coast. He °lso pr .^ ^ to subsidise all Syrian companies ’’whose economic ret.T. gression was nu^ud^ M Meanwhile a Direct or-G :neral of Industries has boon appointed, under the Ministry of National Economy, from wha« # it ie understood, authority will in future bo required before new private industrial ventures can bo undertaken. 19. FQR3IGN SXPZRTS The Gibb Report also recommended the engagement of foreign experts to assist not only in preparing detailed plans of development but -also to help in the implementation of these plans and to educate ana train Syrians to take over from them. The choice of experts, and the order in which they- 24 - they should bo engaged, might well form one of the functions of tha Central Development Board. The Board itself might •!p‘- also require the services of foreign experts for specific schemas* As far as agriculture is concerned, the Agricultural Advisa* to the British Middle Bast Office has recommended the appolntaent of the following foreign experts, to undertake research: (») an agronomist &lt;b) a horticulturist (c) an agricultural chemist * (a) an economic botanist (a) an entomologist. Following on the Report of the United States-Syria Agricultural Mission (see paragraph 21 (a) below) foi*jr American agricultural experts were engaged by the Syrian Governnumt, only one of whom still remains. 20 . A further recommendation of the Gibb Report concerned the creation of organisations capable of operating individual development schemes. Such organisations, which might take the torm of Public Utility Corporations, besides easing the bufdea of work on Government Departments, would be a means of attracting private capital into development schemes. An organisation of this nature, which would include on its board officials of the Government or local administrations as well as members of the public, could be used to advantage in the development of particular areas such as the Jezira, or areas recovered by drainage or new irrigation schemes. It could organise the cultivation of the lands on the most economical lines and divide them into suitable holdings, thus avoiding- 25 - avoiding the setting up of uneconomical farm units. It could per haps be used as a medium for settling semi-nomadic tribes and it ^ould train farmers and peasants in improved methods of agriculture. It could ease the problem of land settlement and land tenure, either by outright purchase of lands or by taking over lands on a long-term basis and paying the owner a fixed rent or interest. It could, by its long-term policy, materially assist in giving agriculture the stability it needs. It could also undertake the launching of new crops needed in quantity by industry or for increasing the export trade, 21. SURVEYS OF b B VflLQPi'viEijT PQS SIB I LIT IE S ( a) Report by Sir Alexander jdibb _and Partners The Gibb Report (which was of course commissioned by the Syrian Government) covered the major natural resources of the country. A summary of the programme of development-which it recommended is contained in xinnex B, ( k) United States-S yria A gricu 11 urLi 1 Missiqn The United States-Syria agricultural Missions' Report ( 19 ^ 47 ) stressed the need for increased cultivation and extended irrigation, mentioning particularly the lands along the Euphrates and in the Jezira and the Valley of the Orentee. The Report also recommended the introduction of better plant varieties and animal breeds and the establishment of agricultural industries, and made specific recommendations concerning research, agricultural education and administrative, regulatory and control programmes, (c) Reports by the British Middle East Office More recent reports to the Syrian Government have been made by the Agricultural, Health, Labour, Forestry and Soil Conservation, and the Statistical Advisers to the British Middle East Office, while the same advisers have submitted a number of confidential Reports to the Foreign Office on the subjects in cbeir respective fields. / / Qn- 26 - On the recommendation of Or.

The Report dealt with , 1 and made recommendations upon, Fi scal Policy, the Tax System and Income Tax. So far as is known, no action has yet been taken on the Report. 22 • SYRIiiR GOVERHiujiMT 1 S PIV'd-YB.iR PL.-.N . Until recently the Syrians had adopted an attitude of economic isolationism, refusing to seek financial assistance for development from outside sources or to employ more than one or two foreign technical experts. ho action had been taken on the Gibb Report. On 1st March last, however, the then Minister of Rational Economy announced that the Government were drafting an important Five-Year Programme of development, which included the following principal projects, (all of which were recommended by the Gibb Report); (a) the enlargement of Latakia port (b) the construction of a railway network in various districts of byria, especially the productive and consumer areas, and the linking of them with byrian ports. (c) the draining of swamps, especially the Ghab plain between Hjms and Latakia, to provide about 250,000 acrea of arable land. U)'&gt; r f ~ (d) the construction of several electric power plants on the Euphrates to provide adequate electric energy for Syrian industry* (e) the execution of several large irrigation projects for the exploitation of the largest possible area of land situated in the North between the Euphrates and the Jezira* The cost of this programme was estimated at £Syrian 200 (£22 million). It was announced that a special fund would be established s outside the State Budget, to finance the programme by means of National loans and other internal measures. How far Zaim proposes to follow up the proposed Programme remains to be seen. Meanwhile, however, item oo is included in the plans to be considered by the new Economic Committee, and it has been reported that a Railway Commission has been set up to reorganise the Syrian railway system. Meanwhile, as regards the Water Supply Scheme for Aleppo, an agreement was recently signed with the Gompagnie Francaise des Etudes Techniques of Paris for the preparation of the detailed plans. RECOMMENDATIONS /- 28 - 23. RECOMMENDATIONS (1) (a) We should encourage the Syrian Government to give first priority to the development of the Jezira and the most easily irrigable stretches of the Euphrates Valley (see paragraph 5( a ) above), as being the projects offering; (i) the earliest substantial return in proportion to the amount of capital works likely to be required, especially in the initial stages, and (ii) considerable scope for effective resettlement of refugees, (in our view the best method of operating the Jezira project would be on the basis of the Gezira Scheme in the Sudan. In this Scheme the Government provides the capital, a Board of Management (Public Utility Corporation) directs the agricultural policy and the marketing of crops, and the tenants are responsible for the husbandry, all participating in the profits), (b) As a corollary to (a) above, the improvement of road communications between the Jezira and the Syrian Coast should be regarded as a high priority requirement. (c) In consultation with the United States Government we should use our good offices with the Turkish and Syrian Governments to enable the Aleppo-Tel Kotchek railway, by means of satisfactory through rates and facilities, to play its proper part in assisting in the development of the Jezira. (2) Every encouragement should be given to the Syrian Government to set up a Central Development Board. (3) We should urge the Syrian Government (a)/(a) to complete the Cadastral Survey of the country, giving first attention to the Jezira (since the effective implementation of nearly all development projects will be seriously prejudiced until this is done); (*) to take effective action in the matter of land tenure reform in the areas to be developed^ (c) to press ahead with the development of co-operative farming 'where this is appropriate; (d) to make every effort to reduce Syrian cereal prices to something like the level of world prices and also to ensure the effective functioning of the proposed Wheat Office; (e) to improve and extend agricultural •training and agricultural research. (4) We should also urge the Syrian Government to press ahead v/ith improving the administration of the Forest Department and the development of afforestation on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 4 above. (5) The selection of further projects and schemes should be left to the Development Board when established, every advantage being taken of requests.for technical and material advice and assistance to ensure that United Kingdom views on the relative merits of projects have a proper influence on their selection. ( 6 ) His Majesty’s Government should endeavour to secure by the means suggested in Recommendation ( 5 ) and otherwise where appropriate: * tha ' t railway development should be regarded as a long-term project, costly in terms of capital and taking longer to complete than roads, and that/(ii)/ - 30 - ♦ that for at least the next 5 years action should be for the most part limited to surveys with a view to determining the most economic routes and undertaken with full regard to the desirability of making road and rail communications c omplementary; (b) tnat port development (other than for oil purposes) should be accorded a low priority, existing proposals being based on prestige rather than economic necessity (but see Reccomendation (7) below; (c-) that the establishment of secondary industries likely to be inefficient and to have unduly high costs should be discouraged. (7) We should encourage the Syrian Government and the Oil Companies to co-operate as fully as possible in the development of roads and port facilities. In framing the.above recommendations we have had in mind the following points: (i) We recognise that they probably imply considerable reorientation of the present view of most Syrians, who are attracted by the more sophisticated projects recommended in the Gibb Report. We can, however, point out that the exploitation of the areas referred to in Recommendation (1), by increasing the prosperity of the cultivators and by producing exports to earn foreign exchange, should help to make possible subsequent desirable but less immediately productive developments such as railway construction and the development of electric power.* - 31 - (ii) The question o: ; any direct assistance which we should give to the carrying out of these projects will he for discussion when international policy with regard to the settlement of Arab refugees is being worked out in detail, (iii) We believe it v/ould be a tactical error to attempt at the outset to press our views too strongly as regards projects other than those mentioned in Recommendations (1 ) to (4) above, as the Syrians may expect too much as a quid pro quo for complying v/ith them. It may be better so to frame any proposals put to them that they will not feel themselves subject to undue interference, relying on consultation and requests for assistance later to secure more unobtrusively any objectives which we consider desirable*ANN5X A RESETTLEMENT PQSSIBILITX-,S IN SYRIA Syria*s capacity for immediate absorption of refugees (which was in any case very limited) has probably now been fully used up. The Jezira . 2. There are estimated however to be about if million acres of cultivable waste land in the Jezira area. The land is largely rain-fed and requires only men and machinery to get it into production. The three most fertile zones are thought to be (a) the Khabur el Byed (b) the district North- East of Kassetche (c) Tel Kotchek. Numbers who mig ht be resettled . 3. Our estimates (further details of which- are given in the Appendix show that the area might we.11 absorb between 100,000 and 245,000 persons, depending on the area assumed to be cultivable and the degree of mechanisation.proposed. It is thought however that it would be unwise to plan on the basis of resettling more than 150,000 persons. One of the difficulties in making these estimates is that it is uncertain how much of the land shown as 'cultivable waste' in the Syrian Government's official statistics has a high enough rate of rainfall to allow for resettlement. A large part of the 1,796,000 acres shown as cultivable may lie in the low rainfall area. Communications . ' 4. Any extensive resettlement will depend, moreover, on the development of road and rail communications both within the Jezira area and between that area and the West. Problems involved in resettlement . . 5. It would probably be best for'settlement in the Jezira to be based on a combination of mechanised and animal agriculture. It may however prove impossible at first to buy sufficient ploughing animals. Small-holdings would be unsuitable. The area /is.is ripe for large-scale farming on an organised basis. A great opportunity is thus presented for establishing co^operailve forms of ownership and management, perhaps on the same lines as those which have proved so successful in the- Sudan. 6. In theory the greater part of the land, is State domain or Government—owned. Owing to the distance away from % the central Government, uncontrolled land acquisition by certain .tribes and important sheikhs has however taken place. It may prove very difficult to upset their claims which, in the unsettled state of the Jezira, cannot be ignored. 7* Unless resettlement is accompanied by instruction and advice in regard to crop rotation, the use of fertilisers, etc., the area will revert to waste land. Cost of resettlement. 8. At a very rough guess, in resettlement is estimated as Surveys Tents (it is assumed that the settlers will gradually build thei: own homes) Wells, etc. Tractors (1000 for 1 million acres) Farm machinery Farm animals Motor transport Unforeseen contingenc ies the initial outlay involved follows: £50,000 £400,000 £50,000 £900,000 or ) £ 1 , 400,000 ) £ 100,000 £ 200,000 • -T:otal £1.700,000 to £2.100.000 9* It is considered that the Syrian Government would be unable to make any part of the cost available from its own resources and that the total would have to be supplied from outside sources. /Road..*Road and Rail cons truc tion. 10# Roads * ^ There is an all-weather road connecting Deir-ez-Zor with Raqqa, Meskeneh and Aleppo (318 kms) and dry-weather roads joining Deir-ez-Zor with Hassetche, Qamiehliye and the North (232 kme*) Roads from Raqqa to Tel AMad (90 kms*) , from Hassetche to Ras-el-Ain (85 kms*), from Qamichliye to Ain Divar and Tel Kotchek (about 90 kms.) and from Mayadine to Abou Kemal (91 kins.) would probably be essential. The total length of roads required would no doubt be at least 600 kms. In 1947 it was estimated that the cost of building secondary roads would be about £S 30,000 per km. ( roughly £3,500 sterling)• Annual maintenance costs would be at least £ 8 500 per km. ’ 11* Annual est i mated c osts for the above programme, spread over 3 years, might be summarised as follows: Capital cost of construction £ S 3*600,000 - £ 400,000 C apital cost of recondi t ioning 400,000 - 44*444 Maintenance charges 600,000 - 66,666 Totals £ 3^4,600,000 £ 511,110 12. The employment of refugees on road construction might provide a valuable form of interior relief works, part of which might be financed by the U.N.R.P.R., in the event of. that organisation converting its activities from pure relief to works projects and of further funds becoming available. 13* Rai Iwaya . The areas of the Buphrate's Valley and the Jezira are at present very inadequately served by rail. There is a single- track, standard gauge railway line which runs N.E. from Aleppo, crosses the Turkish-Syrian border into Turkey at Tchoban Bey and thence runs a few yards North of the frontier lino as far as Nusaibin, where it recrosscs the frontier into Syria and /cuts• ■ . c ^. s aci * os s the ,, duck f s bill H to Tol Kotchok on th*o Syrian .. frontier. From'Tel Kotchck the lino runs southwards . Bagdad. This lino, was 'built as part of the old, • . 1stanbul-Bagdad routo in tho days of the Ottoman Empire, when thore was no frontier separating Syria and Turkey. Tho- tv/o soparato sections now in Syria (Aleppo-Tchoban Boy and Nusaibin- Tcl Kotchok) aro known as tho Lignos Syricnnos do Bagdad, whilst tho soction in Turkey was until recently the only privately- owned standard-gauge line in the country, having no connection with tho' rest of -the Turkish State Railways, except through Aleppo. The whole line nleppo-Tel Kotchek is operated &lt;and Ttiainted by the French concessionary company (Damas, .Hama et‘Proiongements). This railway runs to the north of the cultivated areas of tho Euphrates Valley and. the Jozira and only t’aps the latter area in the districts between Qamichliye and'Tel Kotchck. Virtually the only traffic it carries are those which originate in these districts, plus transit traffic between Bagdad and tho Levant Coast. • perhaps its gravest drawback from the Syrian point of view is that the lino runs through Turkey for so much of its length, with consequent political disadvantages and customs delays. - Thore aro,also certain railway operating difficulties. 14* The following railway linos would be desirable: (a) from Aleppo to Raqqa (200 kms.) (b) from Raqqa to Hassotcho (180 Ictis.) (c) from Hassetcho to Tel Kotchok (130 kma*) 15. The costs (at 1947 prices), including locomotives, rolling stock and all the necessary works, were estimated as follows: (a) £S 26 million excluding a bridge across the Euphrates, costing £3 .5 million; (b) £S 24 million; (c) £g 20 million.A 16. Further lines could *bo constructed as follows: (a) from Raqqa to Deir-oz-Zor (150 kms.) &gt; costing £9 21 million; (to) from Doir-ez-Zor to Atoou Komal (130 kns ) costing £S 20 million. 17. Tho total longth would too atoout 800 kms. This would protoatoly involvo the import of atoout o7f500 tons of t steel rail and 1 million sleepers. . • ■ ' Timin g of rese t tlement • 18. It is suggested that, as a first step, a TochniQal Commission should toe sent to the Jozira area to study-conditions on the spot. The Commission’s work might take 6 months. .After that period, settlement might take up to 2 years, although it might too possible to settle some groups before tho Commission completed its work. Settlement should start at the time of year when settlers would have the opportunity to establish them selves and take in their first crop. 0t hor resettlement possibilities in Syri a 19. (a) Irrigation settlement on tho Khatour River. Tho Gibb Report recommended tho investigation of a canalisation scheme which might provide irrigation for 83,000 acres and land for atoout 60,000 persons, assuming that tho land were to too intensively cultivated and depending on tho quality of tho soil; (to) Irrigation development in the Suphrates Valley from Meskeneh to Raqqa and from Dei3&gt;-ez-Zor to Abou Komal. Relatively little capital would too required, for oil-powered 12 inch pumps and the construction of distribution canals and similar minor works. The present population of /thetho Euphrates Valley ( at out 200,000 in 1947) is sufficient for the cultivation of only about a quarter of the irrigable land on non-intensivo farming# Here again road-building must be an essential accompaniament to any development schemes*,.NNE)C B .

General- Mr. Norris E. Dodd, Director of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, visited Cairo during February and called at this office on the 24th. The meeting was most cordial and Mr. Dodd made it clear to Hefnawy Pasha, the Director of the Near East Regional Office, in our presence, that he wished to see close co-operation between F.A.O. and the B.M.E.O. Development Division. The attitude towards us adopted by Mr. Dodd has already resulted in closer relations between the members of Develonment Division and Hefnawy Pasha and his staff, and one tangible result was the early decision of F.A.O. not to form a Forestry Commission for the Middle East. Instead, Hefnawy Pasha has told us that he will concentrate his efforts on the implementation of Mr. V.K. Maitland’s recommendations for this area. There has also been a marked improvement in our relations with the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture and the Minister of Agriculture entertained the members of Development Division and their wives at a dinner at the Mohamed Aly Club during March. The cordiality of that meeting showed definite progress in our relations with the Ministry of Agriculture, and Mr. VJC. Maitland has been asked to make a survey and drew up a Forestry plan for Egypt. He hopes to do this early in June. Mr. Garner, Deputy Director of the International Bank, accompanied by Mr. Bayne and M. Villechaise, also called at this office on March 17th, and spent two hours discussing Middle East problems with Sir John Troutbeck, members of the Development Division and Mr. Mayall of the Embassy. Development projects and their financial aspects in Persia, Egypt, Iraq and Syria were discussed during a meeting lasting two hours and the question of oil royalties was also broached. It is noticeable that the International Bank now appears to rely on the B.M.E.O. gj; a source of information on Middle East affairs and to have a great respect for the knowledge and experience of the members of Development Division. Our«•... The Rl^ht Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.PFrom the,.., v - P jm Our collator at loo *ith the 0*0,1. team In Persia is mentioned later in the appendices to this despatch dealing with the ¥?ork of each expert, hut it can he said here that the collaboration of British Middle Kast Office _ experts with the American team has been of outstanding ' importance. It is too early yet to say whether the work *■ cf Overseas Consultants Inc, will be a success. While th&lt;0 idea of a teani of surveyors end planners seems a good one, we see no reason why development plans could not be worked out sven more successfully by a team of experts supplemented with ad hoc specialists’i. The excellent relations established by oaf experts in all the countries which they have visited and their success in having their recommendations carried out are In nc small measure due to their ability to deal with and handle in a diplomatic manner the officials and others whom they Vi€?et during their visits. The team appear singularly inexperienced in this aspect of the work although there is no doubt of its importance, 3 * « During the month of February Dr, Prldie attended a Regional Meeting of the World Health Organisation at Alexandria, where he gained the impression that the activities of this organisation, in Sgypt have got away to a good practical start. It will however be some time before one can judge whether or not: worth while results will be forthcoming. Dr. Pridle completed his survey of the whole of Egypt before leaving Cairo on the 6th April on relinquishing his appointment as Health Adviser to this office. His departure is a very £reet loss to our team of experts and to his colleagues throughout the Middle East, and I cannot speak too highly of the work which he accomplished in this area. An official tribute has already been paid to the valuable services which Dr» Pridle rendered in Mr, Middleton*a letter of March 30th to him, and in expressing my own personal regret and that of all my staff at the loss of his services, it is hoped that it will not be long before tangible proof Is seen that his labours for the medical services of the Middle East were not In vain. Dr. Bozraan arrived in Cairo to replace Dr, Pridie on the 26th March. Before Dr, Pridie left he introduced him to many Egyptian medical authorities,~ ~ They both paid a short visit to Port Said to see the arrangement made there for watering vessels passing through the Port, An opportunity was also taken of visiting Fay id to introduce Dr , Bcsinan to the Medical Directorate, G,H .Q., M.E*L.F. 5™* buelr to introduce him to the f G.IJ.Q,, R,a ,F., MED/ME• 4, L abour , During January Mr.Audsley visited the Persian Gul^ spending some days at Bahrein, Qatar, Dahran and Kuweit, He made a very detailed examination of labour conditions with the Oil companies in the whole area and in his report he has given a wealth of information not recorded up to now.3- the 11th tc i/tb iehr.uar^, Mr* Aufisley waa IriJJfegdad to follow up tile, siirvey which he made of labour i?oh^ltI c^rs in Iraq in the summer of 194#* His xacopaendation tlaat tjbe, Iraq Goverxixnsnt appoint a British Labour expert sill probably fee carried oat in the hear future * Fhoa the 19th to the 31st March, Mr* Audsley was on lour again, this time visiting Kirkuk in Iraq, Beirut and Tripoli in the Lebaxscn, and finally Damascus, from where he returned to Cairo on the 1st April* During his visit to Beirut he was able to examine the latest draft of the social insurance scheme which the Lebanese Government propose to introduce, and he also met leaders of anti- Cocuaunist groups cf Trade Unions and had opportunities to discuss the methods of establishing and administering an &amp;&amp;ploysent Exchange service, ?• Agr iculture . At the beginning of the quarter, Sir Herbert Stewart’s programme was thrown somewhat out of &lt;*ear because he was expecting to be called to Persia to wor): with the Overseas Consultants Incorporated Gro up. After* some tiresome delays and contradictory messages from the Embassy at Tehran, it eventually transpired that O.C.I. had brought out their own agricultural experts and that Sir Herbert Stewart’s services were not required* During the time he was waiting for news from Persia, Sir Herbert Stewart was asked tc visit Equatoria and later Cyprus, but he was unable to make these visits as an urgent request came from the Eucan, asking him to advise on abnormal conditions of the cotton crop in the Jezireh, This was done at the beginning of February. Early in March hs went to Bahrain, at Sir Rupert Hay’s request, and he spent ten very useful days touring the country and examining the possibilities of agricultural development in that area. On his way back from Bahrain Sir Herbert visited Bagdad, to study the latest developments regarding irrigation end agriculture and the conditions of employment of foreign experts in Iraq, He returned to Cairo on the 12th March/ 6- £orgat o_and Soil Conaervattop . Early in February the Forestry Adviser went to Cyprus for a week and at the end of February he left Cairo for Persia. His experiences with the O.C.I* team have already been reported to the Foreign Office in his non confident ial and confidential notes written during his stay there. As a result of this visit, Mr. Maitland was asked to join the Q.C.I. team and write a report for Phase II, and he will^be with the A?cericans in Persia until the end of May. It is possible that he will be invited to return in October for Phase III, but it is still hoped that O.C.I. can be induced to engage British, experts to carry out Mr. Maitland’s recommendations and leave him free to continue the excellent work which he has started in other Middle East countries. During..n.Daring his tour of Persia with Dr* Burns t the f Livestock Expert of the 0,C,I* teamj Mr* UaitXand travelled to the borders of Afghanistan snd found that literally thousands of people were dying of hunger in the Slstan area* His note on this greve situation which he submitted to the head of the 0,C.I. team was passed very promptly to the Persian Government and we believe that immediate action was taken to relieve the serious condition of the people inrs the area. It appears likely that had Mr. Maitland not been travelling through this area at such a critical moment, no- one Would have taken the trouble to draw the attention of the authorities to the appalling conditions there. It was learned during the quarter that the Forestry Department of the Lebanese Government have planted a further 1,200 acres end that the Director of Forest Surveys, Antoine Caiha, is now endeavouring to have some Lebanese students sent to Edinburgh University for forestry course’s. We have already asked Edinburgh University to give favourable consideration to applications from the Lebanon. 7. Statistics * Dr. Murray was in U.K. on leave and duty up to the 5th March. In London he interviewed a number of applicants for the post of Assistant Adviser on Statistics here.* From London he travelled direct to Persia to establish relations with O.C.I. as it was understood he would be invited to collaborate with them in Phase II of the 7-fear Development Plan. He was in fact invitad to join the team during May in order to write the statistical chapter of their report, and it is almost certain that he will be asked * to join in Phase III beginning in October 1949. If his secondment to the OoC.I. team is not arranged, the Persian Government intend to request Dr. Murray to remain in Tehran for about a year from October, in order to set up a statistical bureau. From Persia Dr. Murray went to Bagdad on March 21st to examine' the progress made in the setting up of the Statistical Bureau* It was gratifying to note that important progress is being made to carry out Dr. Murray’s recommendations. His report to the Iraq Government, written in 1947, has now been published in English and Arabic and given a wide distribution. The Central Statistical Bureau has now acquired the necessary machines and a new British supervisor whom Dr. Murray selected in London is arriving shortly in Bagdad. The problem of finding a competent assistant for Dr. Murray Is still receiving attention In London and it is hoped that an appointment will be made shortly which will enable Dr. Murray to carry out his programme in Syria and the Lebanon during the summer. 8 - Entomology . Mr. Waterston visited Bagdad in January to meet the Minister of Agriculture in order to discuss British long-term policy for the control of the Moroccan locust, and British interest In both the Desert and Moroccan locust, as it was believed that the Minister was antagonistic to any outside intervention in connection with locust problems. It was noted that after this visit, the Minister included Mr. Waterston“s recommendations in a statement • •. •statement to the press on the Iraq Government policy for locust control. The Entomological Adviser^s presence was necessary in Cairo during the rest of the quarter to deal with the constantly arising problems of locust control throughout the area, A great deal of his time was spent with marked success liaising with the officials* entomologists and locust officers of the countries affected by locust problems, and with the British experts visiting the countries concerned* 9o Animal Husba ndry * It is most regrettable that we have been unable to find an expert in animal husbandry. It is a serious gap in our team and the time of a livestock expert could be very fully occupied in this area, the need for improvement in livestock conditions being very great. 10 a Sir John Troutbeck left for London on the 26ih March, to attend hie meetings of the Middle East (Overseas) Committee for discussioxis on Middle East development as envisaged in the speeches which Mr. Truman and you, Sir, made in February coxicernlng under-developed countries„ MrCrawford visited Beirut, Bagdad and Damascus at the end of March and beginning of April, to obtain up-to-date information on plans and projects for development prior to his departure for London to join in the discussions of the Middle East (Overseas) Committee. 11, I am sending copies of this despatch and of the enclosures to His Majesty 4 s Ambassadors at Tehran, Bagdad, Cairo, Jedda, Angora and Washington, to His Majesty®s Ministers at Beirut, Damascus, Addis Ababa and Amman, to Their Excellencies the Governors of Cyprus and Aden, to the Civil Secretary, Khartoum, the Politica?. Resident, Bahrein, the Civil Affairs Branch, General Headquarters, Middle East Land Forces, the Commissioner- General for South-East Asia and to the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East Forces. 1 have the honour to be, With the highest rasoect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,kJULiLiLS &lt;Covering the i&gt;eriod October 1948 tc March 1949) 1, Visit to Lebanon, Syria and Iraq - 14ih to ll9t October 1948, : ILy visit f^as almost entirely concerned with matters affecting the Iraq Petroleum Co* including the working conditions of firms engaged upon contract work for the Company at Homs, Syria, the formation of a Trade Union of the Company*s Monthly Rate employees at Tripoli, Lebanon, Housing accommodation at Tripoli, the hours of work of their Mechanical Transport Drivers, the application of the Iraq Labour Law to certain classes of the Company 3 a employees at Kirkuk and the organisation of the Company’s Personnel Departments* X assisted the Company in negotiations with the Syrian and Iraq Governments, I visited Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, Latakie, Benias and Tartous and was able to appreciate the extent of proposed oil and other industrial developments In these areas c 2 0 Visits to the Persian Gulf - 22 c d tonmry to 30th February 1949 . My programme covered Bahrain (7 days) Qatar (4 days) Dhahrsn - Saudi Arabia (1 day) and Kuweit (8 days). The Oil Companies operating in these areas occupied my main interest but enquiries relating to the general social conditions were Included as circumstances oermitted. At Bahrain, my investigations Included the growth of the industrial development of the Bahrain Petroleum Co*, its personnel, the balance between American and British staff, the differential Salary rates of British and American employees, reasons for termination of contracts, housing end amenities of all employees, conditions of employment and accommodation of Indian and Pakistan labour and Arabs, transportation problems, industrial relations, education of Arabs, the Government’s Technical and ordinary schools, Provident and Thrift Funds. My enquiries at Qatar (Petroleum Developments (Qatar) Ltd* - subsidiary of Iraq Petroleum Co*) and at Kuweit (Kuweit Oil Co*) followed similar lines. The one day v s visit (5 hours) to Dhahrsn (Arabian - American Oil Co*) was in the nature of courtesy call in view of the Company being wholly American* I was shown the amenities provided for the 5,000 Americans (including families), the new village for the Saudi workers and their Hospital, the vocational and educational training arrangements. In addition, I had a talk with the spokesman of the several hundred Sudanese about whom there had been many complaints in the early stages. I also enquired about the 1,500 Italian artisans employed by the Company* 3* Visit to Bagdad - llth_to J.7th February 1949 ? This was a follow-up to my survey in June-July 1948 and was mainly concerned with the proposal that the Iraq Government should appoint a British Labour expert to undertake the re-organisation of the Labour Department of the Ministry of Social Affairs. It was encouraging to find that the new. Minister was of the opinion that a Brltisy Civil Servant with wide experience in labour administration was essential to build up the day to day work of the Directorate and to ensure the practical training of its officials* He was supported by H.R»H. The Begent and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The proposal was to go before the OOOOthe Council of Ministers, whose decision is awaited. Several other matters were dealt with while I was at the Embassy, 4 0 Visits to Kirkuk (Iraq) and Tripoli (Lebanon) - 19th to 24th March 1949, These visits were follow-ups to my enquiries last October. Main matters discussed were payment for lost time due to bad weather (Kirkuk) and the appointment of an Industrial Relations Executive (Tripoli). I also discussed with the General Secretary of the new Union at Tripoli the progress made with its organisation, I also gave an address on Middle East social conditions to a group of newly engaged employees of the Company, Visit to Beirut - 2 1st to 26 th Mar ch 194 9, I had discussions with the Director General of the Lebanese Ministry of Justice regarding the latest draft of their Social Insurance Scheme,' He furnished me cooies and I am to have talks about the scheme with Professor Robson of the London School of Economics during my forth coming visit to London, I also met officials of the Ministry of National Economy and discussed the progress made with implementing the Resolutions passed at the IoLoO.Conference at Istanbul In November 1947. Much of the time was connected with the methods of establishing and administering an Employment Exchange Service. I met the leaders of the two anti-eomU'Unist groups of Trade Unions and one of my suggestions was that a selected number should.go to London for a 3 months course under ths Ministry of Labour and National Service Scheme for Foreign Trade Unionist Missions. I discussed with Mr, Milner of Shell Co, a Group Medical Scheme on which he is working; it fellows the lines of the Voluntary Hospital Funds in the U„K. before the advent of the Social Insurance Scheme. Visit 2?th to Damascus - The 28th and 29th March were occupied in preliminary enquiries and included interviews with the Director General of Labour regarding the IoL„0. Istanbul Conference Resolutions, visit to a Labour Office, interviews with Trade Union leaders and representatives of British firms. But ray enquiries were abruptly ended by a military coup d'etat which started in the early hours of the 30th Jfer^h. It was useless for me to oroceed and I returned to Beirut on' the 31st March and tcT Cairo on the 1st April, 7. Between the visits described in the .preceding paragraphs, I was engaged upon my usual Embassy duties.

Bookings were made accordingly. That tour also had to be cancelled two days later following the receipt of another message from Tehran that X would not now he required there till later. By this time it was impossible to carry through my original intention of visiting iSqn&amp;tcris, a;? the Director of Agriculture and Forests and others ^hom I was to have accompanied had already gone, and,the area to be visited was too inaccessible to permit of making fresh travelling a r range me nt s quic kly. 3„ Arrangements were then made to visit Cyprus but these had to be cancelled following the receipt of urgent telephonic and telegraphic requests from the Sudan that I should proceed there immediately in order to advise on abnormal conditions which had appeared in the Gesirs cotton crop and which, it was thought, might resemble a disastrous condition known as *tirak 4 with which I was familiar in the Punjab, during my service in India. I proceeded at once to Khartoum and spent a week in February In a thorough examination of the Goairs cotton crop, In company with senior officials of the Sudan Plantations Syndicate and of the Department of Agriculture end Forests, Subsequently on ray return to Cairo I prepared and sent to the Sudan Government a report embodying my obver sat ions and views. Appreciation of this report end of ray visit was exoressed In mors than one letter which I received later. 4. Efforts to arrange for an immediate visit to the Sudan of Professor R.H. Paster, from India, a plant physiologist who has specialised ’In* “Punjab tirak% failed owing to delay on the part of the Government of India in sanctioning his deputation, till the cotton season became too far advanced. It is hoped to arrange in good time for him to go to the Sudan next year, at a date when conditions are optimum for his study of the problem..10. o c 5c At the request of the Political Resident, PersisivGulf 4 I visitedr Bahrain at the beginning of March f£f the purpose of advising on the possibilities of agricultural^ development in Bahrain,. I soent four da vs ^ in studying conditions on;Bahrain, island itself and on Sltrs. another Island in the group.-, I had ;sn interview with H,K. the Sheikh of Bahrain, during which h® said that hs was most anxious to appoint a British agricultural officer to improve and develop the agriculture and horti culture of Bahrain 0 I promised to give all possible assistance In finding a suitable officer, as soon aa Mr» Bdlgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, supplies particulars of the terms and conditions of appointment, 6 0 Since my return to Cairo I have prepared and sent to*the Political'Resident a report which embodies my views on the extent of the future possibilities of* agriculture in the rsgion-and on the pattern which agriculture can best take,, 7o On my way back to Cairo from Bahrain I spent five days in Bagdad ?yhere I renewed contacts with our own Embassy, the O.S.&amp;. Embassy, the Director-General of Agriculture, officers of the Irrigation Develooment Commissioh and other officials of the Iraq Government. 1 brought our knowledge up to date in regard to projected developments in irrigation and agriculture In Iraq and various other matters which affect the employment of foreign specialist officers in that country. Ihe information which 1 collected in these and other connections has been reported In a note entitled ** v rbe present position of irrigation and agricultural development in Iraq”, which I prepared after my return to Cairo. Copley of this note have been sent to the Foreign Office and to the Embassy, Bagdad. During my stay in Bagdad I had a .special meeting with the U.3.A. Embassy to discuss with them Truman''s rourtn point 5 (technical aid to underdeveloped countries) in its application to Iraq. This discussion took place at the request of the American Embassy which had just received from Washington a telegram requesting them to report immediately on tnis* subject. ^he discussion has been reported fully in a separate note, copies of which have issued to i'orfcign Office and to the Bagdad Embassy. 9o During the quarter I have prepared notes on number of important development projects in the Middle East* These includes- (1) A note on the Qena Irrigation project in Upper Egypt, prepared primarily for the International Bank from which Egypt is seeking a loan for the purpose. (2) An analysis of the Bekhme Dam flood control and irrigation project on the Tigris in Iraq.

Polloving return frum Syria and the Lebanon In September and asy laftediately preceding atay of eeven aontha in Pereia, I vafi able to epead the flrat eix veeha of the quarter andlng Deetsoar 31st on office worlr, thla period being the longeat apent in Cairo in the whole of 1946, Even thia was interrupted by a thra® week sojourn In ho«pital r twt during this I was able to ooapiete ay confidantial reporta on wy Pereian.

Syrian and Lebaneae work and to draft a 55~pag;$ Interln report for the Persian Government containing the Important urgent recomiaandfttiona on the at&amp;tlatice of each Government Department resulting from *y invsatlgallone during the Spring, At the same tiae I received an invita tion from the British Ambassador in Tehran to proceed to that city as soon as possible in order to be present, along with Sir Herbert Stewart,during the visit of the Phase I (high level/preiialnary aarvey) f roup of Oversea* Consrultantc- The completion of the erel&amp;n Interim report was therefore particularly timely, since it provided the excuse to the Persian .Government for ®y visit; equally timely vae the arrival on November 2nd of the newly appointed Assistant Statistical Adviser, Mr. W,J, Rollo, which provided the means to release ac from a commitment in the Lebanon, It will be rcoeafcered that while the poet of Assistant Statistical Advlaer had been sanctioned In December 1947 f a eerie a of ml ^fortunes had lost us the very good candidate selected for the post and delayed the appointment. The work of advising on statistics io inevitably detailed and very readily becomes executive; consequently long peri ode have to be epent; In any one country. At the same time with economic development in the air, the need for good adnsinietrativc statistics i» felt even by Kiddle East Governmente. The demands for ay servicea had been, far aver a year, much more than one man could meat. The arrival of Hollo appeared to provide the aolution to the problem of ay being in two or more places at once. After careful briefing, Polio was rent to the Lebanon in «id~Nove#ber to undertake an analysis of mortality statistic#,,necessary If the Government Actuary wae to aupplement the work on aoclal insurance undertaken by Prof. Hobr.on, an analyels which the Lebanese appeared quite Incapable,if not undeciroue, of preoaring thesaeslv^g. Hollo, who had never before left the U,K,,encountered the full force of the Lohanee® paselve resistance move-ment and had made little or no progress wher., on the death of hi* father, he returned to Britain and promptly resigned, thereby disorganising the whole of my plans far work in the Spring and leaving the offlot in the lurch./ O &gt; . al In tii® aeanttme X spent thres w«eke, coameiiQing November loth in P or Hip., mainly in an interuslve list son campaign with Ovgreee.f? Consultant», With, this first group, I, lit® Sir Herbert Stewart, found it easy to get on good relation8 and I was soon bri terms of personal friendeblp with Messrs Lott, Barber and Coffman, the three principal members of the Delegation* In thie my prevloue acquaintance and work with Mr. Thornber^ was of much value. T Invited to accompany the gx’oup on a tour of the Caspian Provincsa^ In which my proviou« knowledge of the covmtry may have been of some aesietance to them and •certainly enabled i^e to direct their attention to the more important lines of eoonoaile development, with the discussion of which between the Brltieh and American Embassies X had been closely ooncornied in the Spring. Sir Herbert and myself endeavoured to bring Mr. V.K, Maitland’s previous ’work to the attention cf the group and link Ms nsmo with discuesione on goi^-ooneerv&amp;tion and foreetry. This salesmanship appeared to be aucc®ee- ful with the Phase I party but doac not, as Maitland found in February, appear to hav® baen paseed on by them to the Phaa* IX group. I gave- a complete outline of my work to the 0,0,1. party and dleouesed frankly and fully the recommendations made in the report, which I had brought with me, kt the earn® time T banded thia report to the Persian Government and distributed pergonal copi&lt;??R of. the appropriate sections to the principal statistical offlcea. Action was initiated on a number of my chief recommendations!, in particular th$ Invitation of tenders for punched earA machinefi, A•number of advances had been made in Persian ?afc&amp;t3*tie* in accordance with rbcommendationg r&amp;ade in July,parti -ul^rly in regar^ to th® mov^aent to key positions of some of the: better Pereian staff, Throughout ay stay 1 kept'in very close touch with the British and American Embassies and believed, when I left, that the Phase I group of O.C.T, had accepted the idea of 5.M.S.0, co-operation. From the British point of vie%- a success had aleo been Achieved in that Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners had baen invited to become a member of the Overseas Consult ants consortium, kftdv completing the usu&amp;I reports on this Persian visit. I proceeded to the Lebanon and Syria where T spent about ten days in mid-December. I found that th* Lebanese had ^downed tools*’ on thw social insurance statisties, embracing gladly the opportunity given by Holloas resignation and that while they war® still anxious that X should come an orge.nla Central Statis tical Btireau for them, they viewed the postponement of isy viait to the early eumuer, which was now likely,with that equanimity in the conteixplation of delay, which le the finest flower of the Levantine Mvilisatlon. In Syria, a different and. pleasing eituation Was found. i Th$ Government had accepted my recommendation that they appoint Faiz Bey el Khoury, a foraer Palestine official, tbf/lr Statistical Adviser and he,with much energy had completed every one of the taaks which X had reooramerided in my report in September. Steps were well advanced to wards the publication of •* statistical Abstract, the organisation of a Central Bureau, the examination for faults of the exicting figures and the ordering of an Installation of machines. Khoury ms very anxious to have the Statistical Bureau set on Its feet legally and officially and X therefora drafted &amp; complete Law of stice fer the of the Syrian Governmerit . Ial , after exiusination of the ottuatlon, made a I'urther report to the Mnleter of Kationid Eeonoay Indicating the next oerle® of eteps to he taJten and it waa agreed that these would occupy the aoaewhat ans&amp;gre administrative re source e of the Section, and the much greater energy of Khoury hiBeelf, throughout the Spring and that ay return to Syria vme not necessary until the early euoaer, I returned to the U.JT. on December Slat and wae on leave at the conolueion of the quarter. T epent the period January let to March 6th in the tf.K. Out Of this tiae about one month was spent in London on duty and the remainder formed a somewhat Interrupted leave. The principal matters dealt with were as follows:- 1. general Development, Middle Saet. During my stay in London I reported on my work to various departmente of the Foreign Office and had a number of diacuaelcmn at which I expressed »y viewe on general development in the Middle Fact. Of these interviews the most Important was that with the Secretary of State, to whoa 1 reported on ay own work specifically, and development generally, chiefly in Persia, I discussed in particular the activities of O.C,I, and the need for the continuation of the British policy of Koonomic Development. In a letter, which I wrote to the Secretary of State at hie request, after the interview, X endeavoured without proceeding beyond what T had previously mentioned to thi? Head of the Qffloe, to etresa the need for our passing from the advisory to the executive stage and for setting up a more powerful organisation of the B.M.IE.O. type, to k$©p paoe with any machinery which the Americans may bring to bear in pursuance of a development policy, 2, Progress of Seven Year Plan in Persia. While X was in London the situation in regard to our relationships with O.C.I. in Persia and their relationships with Governmental agencies, developed somewhat less eatiBfaotorily than it had been hoped; and X was involved in a number of talks on thle matter. In addition to discussions within the Foreign Office, X had a number of talks with the partners of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, and assisted the Middle East Secretariat In dfcecueeione with one or two other British bueineoc men,interested in Persian development. Among the cables we received, however,there was nothing to indicate that the Phase 1 Overseas Consultant« group had gone back on their original half promise to support a request for my secondment to the Persian Government, and since it was considered desirable that t should, if possible,accept any Percian offer X took the neceueary steps to arrange that the machinery of secondment could operate when required. I therefore* arranged with Personnel Department such matters as dates, tense, return to H.M.G. etc; thie matter, of course, is not yet completed as it involves the question of fiQf a renewal of my contract in absentia.*- 4 *' 3. AgglBtant.• It w&amp;e clear that I could not In any caee be seconded to the Persian C^overniaent without an assistant of high-quality, who will In effect be a replacement in ay abeence. The great part my of working time io the U.K. was therefore spent In searching for candidates. I considered that this was beat done by personal contact and therefore drafted, in conjunction with Middle East Secretariat and Personnel Department, a circular letter explain ing the nature of the work, the type of pereon required and all details of the emoluments etc. This &gt; was despatched to all University Appointments Board® all likely bodiee concerned.with statistics and a considerable number of personal contacts. Xn most cases the letter was followed up by a personal approach to the sources concerned. By these mean© about twelve satisfactory names were received and all th« 0 Q candidates were interviewed,some in London other® while X was on tjpur In Scotland during ay leave. Three first cl®a and three good candidates were produced by this and the not result Is that despite the loss of one or.two of these,® eatlefaot- cry appointment ie now highly probable and T have,at the same time, acquired &amp; w pool tt on which I can draw for other appointments in the-Middle East. 4. Other Staffin g, Middle East . I had been asked-by the Persian Government to examine the ppeelbillty of obtaining British personnel for two of the technical-poets which X had recommended in my interim report vies Central Statistical Bureau Adviser and Census Adviser. For the former, it ime- clear that one of the better candidatesg for the B.M.E.O, appointment would be admirable; for the latter, X have obtained the consent of Mr e David Pare!vai, who has Juat completed the Cyprus Census, to come to Persia if asked. I had a number of Interviews with Perelval and thought him wholly suitable; and we got down to considerable detail in regard to the proposed sensue organle&amp;tion. The confirmation of both appointment© avai-tc final decision by the Persian Government in May; when X gave them the names In March, the position on Ssvtn Year Plan funds was not clear and no final decision could be taken. I also, at the request; of the Iraq Government, interviewed e number of candidates for the post of Supervisor of the punched card machines in the Central Statistical Bureau at Bagdad, These interviews were carried out at the Iraqi Embassy and X was able to secure a very suitable official in the person of Mr. J. Ash- I proceeded to Persia an 6th.March and remained there a fortnight, partly in order to pro gress the recommendations i had made in November, (which are moving slowly,but not unsatisfactorily), but mainly to clarify my position in relation to 0,0.1. Maitland had found that the.second Phase group of this body were not «o forthcoming as the first had been, and were inclined to cut themselves apart from Governmental agencies,particularly their own and our Embassies; nor did their expert®, though their technical competence was unquestioned, appear at the outset to have quite the necessary flair for approach. My awn position was romewhat simplified /... owing^ * owing to sny Novtaber vl»tt, and on my flrnt inter view with Thornberg and Bookvalter, the Read of the 0»C.I. teas, they aeked ae to Join the teas for the aonth at May in ordar to write the ntatie- tleaX chapter of their report, and eald that if it lay with thea, they would a»k for *y eecondaent froa R.M.a, for a one year period commencing early Autumn as advieer on etatlatloal organleation, Later conversations with Mr. I^tehaj and H.fc.H. Prince Abdul Re&amp;a, make it seem probable that even if the choice does not lie with 0,C.l. # the Peraiane will etill want me on their own behalf,Just as they do Maitland. I discussed detaile fully with Bookwalter and agreed that X should not arrive until the early A utumn, which give* me time to complete my commitments in Byrla and the Lebanon, provided I have ay assistant. Prom Persia, I proceeded to Iraq where I remained until ay return to Cairo on April 16th, The object of my visit wae to advance action on ay statistical recommendations and in this field J. have made the beet progreee In a similar period which I have ever experienced. Nbt only ie the atmosphere much more favourable to ue, while development it in the air, but by a fortunate chance all plane on the statistical side on which I have been working for the past two years,have begun to come to fruition together. Thuo my report of 1947 has been printed in both English and Arabic and widely distributed within the Government; It hae been placed on the Agenda of the Council of Mini stare and will very shortly receive sanction In principle. The fact that the report had neither been passed nor printed did not, of course, present any obstacle in the Iraqi mind to aotion being taken on it and,In fact, over one third of the recommenda tions have already been carried out. The Central Statistical Bureau has now acquired its inetailation of machines,which are in situ and ready for action when a supervisor arrives; elx statistical Jobs are organised and designed ready to put on these machines. The statistical Abstracts for 1947 and X94B are both ready and I persuaded tlie Government to put them out to print by contract in view of the Government Pres© delay©. I also assisted the Bureau to oalculato the 1947 Balance of Paymenta, The Customs Statistical Section ha© now greatly improved in speed and efficiency and its new machines have arrived. I was able through the Minister of tUac! Finance to arrange for proper accommodation! for new macMn*r. The biggest progress hae been made by the Ccnru* Organisation. I was much Impressed by the efficient appearance and practice of the office and by the way In which they had carried out in faithful detail all the recommendations made, either by myself, or by the specialists of the punched card machine company. I spent a large part of ay time in Iraq drawing up a revised scheme of tableo with the technical system for obtaining these froa the machinea with the minimum of time and effort, I also examined, at ths request of the British Embassy, the etatietlcal system f or lack thereof) of the Import Licensing Department of the Government and drew up a rcheme.

Daring this period I visited the industrial centre of Muhalla R1 Kubra, the new hospital under construction at Mansourah, and anti malaria work being carried out in Wadi Matron and in Edku, and the Anglo-Egyptian Oil Company*s stations at Has Gharlb on the west side of the Gulf of Suez and El Matarna on the east side. I also visited Suez and Alexandria in the normal course of my duties. In February I attended the inaugural meeting of the Eastern Ifedlterranean Regional Committee of the World Health Organisation, which was a most successful and impressive meeting. I have been busy carrying out the usual work concerning the Egyptian Health Services, medical schools and problems concerning the Sudan and Egypt during this period. (SGD) EcD.

(Signed) M.M. DuMerton A.G. Maitland* CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l. 7th June, 1949.gCONOMIG DEVELOPMENT IN CYPRUS IN RELATION TO THE MIDDLE EAST Memorandum by the Colonial Office 1* Cyprus is now at the beginning of the fourth year of its approved ten-year development programme. The basis of planning is that about £4 million will be spent over the ten-year period, of which £1,75 m. will come from Imperial funds made available under the C.D. and W Act and the rest from Cyprus 1 own revenues. This programme, as now adjusted, is somewhat more cautious than the plan originally produced in 1946, though based on it, and excludes schemes for which experience suggests that money, man power, or materials may not be available’ for some time to come. The largest allocations are to irrigation, education, medical and health services, forests, and village development (in that order) and the programme is watched over by a local development committee under the chairmanship of the Financial Secretary, 2, In addition to the ten-year plan proper, Cyprus has launched a comprehensive electricity grid scheme, to be financed by loan. If this is added to the development account, total expenditure between 1946 - 56 will probably be in the neighbourhood of £6 million. 3, The most notable feature of Cyprus f development programme so far has been the anti-malaria campaign, now in its last stages. The malaria mosquito species has been almost entirely eradicated throughout the Island and attention is now con centrated on preventing its re-introduction from ships and aircraft. Solid though less sensational progress has been made in irrigation by use of the many small winter streams, in soil conservation, and in forest conservation and re afforestation after the heavy overcutting of the war years. Irrigation, soil conservation, and afforestation must be developed /as...-V as a continuous process; and work in these fields will clearly go on after the end of the ten-year plan on much the same scale as at present. The electrification scheme may also he expected to spread over a considerable period. Although it is not yet possible to obtain any clear picture of what will happen after 1956 it is certain that the present programme will not see the end of Cyprus 1 needs in economic development.' 4. The limiting factor in Cyprus at present is not so much lack of funds or lack of technicians (the standard of the technical staffs can fairly be claimed to be good) as lack of materials. As long as there are difficulties in obtaining and storing adequate stocks of fuel oils (a problem enhanced by the closure of Haifa in 1948), forests will continue to be overcut: as long as there is a shortage of water-pipes, irrigation schemes will be held up. Later there may also be difficulty in raising the capital necessary for new major schemes; but up to the present this has not caused any serious embarrassment, despite the extreme reluctance of the private Cypriot investor to put his money into anything that does not offer the chance of an immediate and substantial return. 5. Though politically Cyprus stands aloof from the Arab countries, there is scope for aspects of economic development in the Island to be brought into closer relation with our economic policy in the Middle East, and it is the intention that this should be done. In certain fields Cyprus is far in advance of Middle East countries where similar conditions and problems prevail: notably in forestry, small-scale irrigation, malaria control, and rural co-operative development. The reports of the Scientific Mission to the Middle East published in 1946 (the Keen-Worthington reports) drew attention to a number of fields in which conditions in Cyprus made it suitable to play the role of a 'laboratory' in relation to the /Middle.•»Middle East. The British-Middle East Office is therefore attempting with the co-operation of the Cyprus Government, to make some use of Cyprus as a demonstration and training centre in these fields. The largest single step so far in this direction has heen taken by the agreement of the Cyprus Government to enlarge the Forestry School now being built under their development programme to take in a certain number of Middle East students. Syria, Lebanon and Trans jordan are knov/n to be keen to send their men there for training. The British Middle East Office has also arranged visits to Cyprus by Middle East Forestry Directors and the F.A.O. are now proposing to carry out training courses in forestry, soil conservation and land use in Cyprus for Middle East students. A number of foreign visitors, including some from Egypt and other Middle East countries, have also been to see the anti-malaria campaign and locust control work; and a visit from the Director of the Co-operative Division of the Persian Ministry of Labour is now being arranged. Cyprus officials are also being given an opportunity to make known the work done in the Colony by attendance at international conferences on technical subjects, e.g. the recent F.A.O. conferences on land use held at Rome and at Florence on Mediterranean forestry problems. This process was initiated by the attendance of Cyprus representatives at Middle Eastern technical conferences called during the war by M.E.S.C. such as the 19^4 Agricultural Development Conference (Cyprus was to have participated in the abortive Middle East Council of Agriculture); it is still in its early stages and may be expected to develops,(2A) IRRIGATIO N DEVELQPM SMT IN IRAQ .

Ira( I Government early in 19ko as head of* ® ? ri J i 1 sh Irrigation Development Commission, which was to a comprehensive survey of irrigation, water storage,, flood control and land drainage possibilities, and draw up plans for construction works for the Iraq Government.

Development of irrigation and power resources ^ erefore necessarily take place gradually, and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture. The Irrigation Commission considers that the full development outlined above is unlikely to be required before the end of the century. Spread out over this period, the cost would involve an average annual expenditure of about £2 million only. .Meanwhile, the immediate needs are flood limited irrigation development and drainage in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a programme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £24,200,000 or £2,420,000 per annum (See part II below). Work on the first stage of the Euphrates projectproject is already in hand. . Tho Commission’s recommendations for the Tigris have now been studied by the Consulting Engineers who have recommended an alternative combination of works which would be rather more expensive. Their recommendations are summarised in Part II below. ^ When the Iraq Government has taken-a decision as between these recommendations and those of Mr.Haigh, it is hoped that the first stage of the works will be put in hand without further delay. Finance s ' 3. The Commission anticipated that a large proportion of the capital expenditure will be recovered from the increase in land values resulting from the works, and that revenue sufficient to make the various prpjects productive will be obtained. They have'submitted detailed proposals to the Iraq Government for a taxation system to cover the cost of the works, involving the levying of taxes on urban property, irrigated land and the crops produced. Meanwhile the International Bank are considering the possibility of a loan to finance the cost of the.first stages of the scheme, estimated as follows:- Project Period for Sterling Dollar Dinar cost Completion cost cost Completion of Habbaniyah project. •3 years- £”00,000 - ID,1,700,000 First Stage Wadi Tharthar project 3 years- £1,437,700 ,26,483,200 ID. 3,921,200 Gibraltar dam 3 years £1,256,000 ^ 360,000 ID.l,288,000 on Diyala Total £2,993,700 26,843,200 ID.6,909,200 The Bank are sending a technical mission to Iraq in June to study these projects. 4* Future of the C ommiss ion: The Haigh Irrigation Commission is now being* disbanded, although Mr.Haigh himself, with a nucleus of British engineers, is remaining in Iraq until after the visit of the International Bank Mission. It is hoped that the Iraqi Government will, then agree to prolong Mr.Haigh’s contract until early in 1950 in order to enable him to write up and publish his conclusions in detail. It is also hoped that a Development Branch of the Irrigation De partment will now be set up under a British Irrigation engineer whose functions would be:- (a) To continue the work of the Commission in planning the construction of smaller storage v/orks, distribution wo«fc£, and land drainage, and (b) To keep alive and interpret to the Iraq Government the work of the Commission. II.II, The British Irrigation Commission’s latest report,dated the £Qtl» JJooonrilQO» ™ Q \r a,i Timarised as follows:- im orkg: 7, i^i Euphrates 3*(a| r ^ The Commission has drawn up detailed plans and designs for the development of the existing flood control works at the Habbaniyah lake. This development should ensure flood control of the river and will provide water for the irrigation of about 1.6 million acres. The estimated cost of the works is £3&gt;375»000. The work is planned to proceed in two stages, the first stage, which would cost £2,7 millions and would provide irrigation water for 730,000 acres, has already been put in hand and could, it is estimated, be completed in two years; (b) Additional flood control and water storage can be provided by the construction of a reservoir utilising the Abu uibbis and Bahr-al-Milh depressions. This project has not yet been surveyed in detail but a preliminary investigation indicates that its cost will be about £2 million and that it will provide irrigation water for about 1,200,000 acres. 6. A number of alternative projects and combination of projects for water storage on the Tigris have been examined. As a result, the Commission has now recommended to the Iraq Government (c) that the Wadi Tharthar project should be developed as the main flood control and water storage reservoir for the Tigris, (see fi.E.(o) (47)3? paragraph 5)» This project, wnich can be carried out by stages, involves the construction of a barrage across the Tigris at Samarra and of long inlet and outlet channels. The first stage, which will provide for flood control only, is estimated pJjjO cost £7 million. The second stage will cost an additional million and, will provide irrigation water for about 2.7 million acres. It is considered that this project will alone ensure complete flood control of the Tigris and its tributaries except on rare occasions. The Commission recommends that, to make flood c^rtrol complete and also to provide additional ir^ig^.tioi water, the wadi Tharthar project would be supplemented by: (d) A dam at the Gibraltar site on the ioiya 1 a, This project has been prepared in detail It is estimated that it will cost 1.3 ^2,580,000: and will provide irrigation water for 1.2 million acres. (e) A dam at Bokhan on the lesser Zab. Plans for this project are being drawn up. It is estimated that it will cost about £3 million, and will provide irrigation water for about 1.4 million acres. (11) Irri gation B^ve lopm ent. 7* Id addition to the water storage w ;rks described Tigris: / ab ove.above, the development of irrigation involves the construction of distribution works i.e, canals and their appertinent works. Detailed designs for these distribution works have not yet been prepared. In the absence of such ^ designs the cost of these works which will provide for the irrigation of about 8 million acres, is roughly estimated as follows: Euphrates extension: £12.75 millions Lesser Zab extensions: £4. 61 millions The Ishaqi, Diyala and Nnhrwan areas £7.15 millions Lower Tigris areas £10*75 millions Total £35*26 millions (3) Drainage. 8. In Iraq, experience has shown that drainage is essential if the proauctivity of irrigated lands is to be maintained. without it irrigated lands are liable to become saline or waterlogged. The Commission has, therefore, strongly recommended that all areas both of existing irrigation and new developments should be provided with an adequate drainage system. Several small drainage schemes have been worked out in detail and from these a gross rate has been calculated. The total cost is estimated as follows:- Old irrigated area requiring drainage 4. 21 million acres £8»l6 millions. New irrigated area: 8 million acres; £15.72 millions Total £23.88 millions (4) Hydro-electric power; 9* The power development possibilities of the development scheme outlined in paragraph I abjve are small, since economical water storage requires low dams which result in little and expensive power. The quality of power which it is estimated can be produced at each site and the appropriate cost (including construction of power station, /generatinggenerating plant and transmission are as follows: Sites Power K.W. Cost Wadi Tharthaf 389 OOO £ 3 , 000,000 ''Gibraltar dam 13,000 £ 1 , 350,000 Do kb an dam h.0 ,000 £ 2 , 000,000 Total '93,000 ( 5 ) Navigation: 10. The Commission has recommended that certain small regulating works should he undertaken on the Lower Tigris in order to permit the maintenance of navigation at all times with the use of very little vi/ater. These works have not been worked out in detail. The total cost might be about £ 3.65 millions. Plan at Works for the next ten ye ar s: The Commission has recommended the following plan of works for the next ten years* Storage works: Completion of Habbaniyah Cost project - stage I Completion of Wadi Tharthar £2 million project - stage I Construction of Gibraltar dam £7 million on the Diyala Drainage in old areas: £ 2 , 580,000 at a rate of £ 300 , 000 . p. a. £ 3 , 000,000 Irrigation Development* s 4 . 750.000 T o t a ! £19,33 0,000 Con sulting Engine ers* Report 12. The Iraq Government’s Consulting Engineers, Messrs. Goode, Vaughan-Lee, Prank and Gwyther, have examined the Commission^ recommendations for the Tigris in conjunction /withwith Sir William Halcrow and Partners. They consider that there are strong technical 'objections to the use of 4 the Wadi Tharthar depression for irrigation storage, since th^^ high water levels involved would impose a heavy strain on the long length of embankment required and constitute a grave danger to Bagdad. They have therefore recommended that the Wadi Tharthar project should be carried out for flood control only, and that a project, rejected by the Haigh Commission, for a dam on the Greater Zab at Beckhme should be undertaken for irrigation storage, at an estimated cost of £9 millions. This dam might be supplemented later by the construction of further dams on the Lesser Zab and the Diyala. Mr. Haigh has now written a further paper in which he endeavours to dispel the Consulting Engineers fears about the development of the Wadi Tharthar, and it remains to be seen which opinion the Iraq Government will accept. Meanwhile the Iraq Government has now instructed the Consulting Engineers to prepare detailed specifications for the first stage of the Wadi Tharthar works. Middle East Secretariat, Foreign Office, 18th May, 1949.' I9f ; (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITlfTNic LlAJESTY t S GOVERNLffiNT) ■ SECRET “• ^ i 2 M,E.(Q)(49) 15 COPY NO. 13th May. 1949. ’4' ' L-' ¥ CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST Note “by the Joint Secretarlas We circulate herewith, for the information of the Committee, a Paper on Iraq (M.E.(0)(49)W.P # 5)* which has been prepared by the Committee’s Working Party in pursuance of Recommendation (c) in paragraph 36 of M.E.0.(49)14 of May 10th, 1949. 2* This paper v/ill be followed (a) by papers covering in turn most or all of the other countries in the area with which the Committee is concerned, and then (b) by a paper containing selective recommendations arising out of these surveys of individual countries* 3. Members of the Committee are asked to furnish the Secretary of the Working Party with any observations they may wish to make on this Paper* But the Committee will not be asked to give final endorsement to any specific action until it considers Paper (b)* Cabinet Office, S*W.l 13th May, 1949.2 specific projects. The present position may be summarised as follows:- (a) Gommunic 3 .tions (i) Railways The Iraqi State Railways Administration (which is directed by British officials and has an independent budget) has drawn up a programme of development works, estimated to cost about £10 millions. The plans include three bridges over the Euphrates, Tigris and Lesser Zab rivers, a new railway station and layout at Bagdad, a seventy mile rail extension from Kirkuk to Brbil in Northern Iraq and the purchase of rolling stock in the United Kingdom. Work on them has now been put in hand and £4i million has already been expended. In order, however, to enable the works to be completed it will be essential for the Railway Administration to roc jive a loan from outside sources of £3 to £6 millions. Certain of these works - o.g. the Bagdad railway station - are considered to be unnecessary and unduly costly in relation to Iraq’s present development needs and resources. Tentative nlans have also been prepared for the considerable expansion of the Iraqi railway system both internally and by construction of new lines linking Iraq with Turkey and Syria. The estimated cost of these long-term projects is about £34 million of which £15 millions would bo spent in the purchase of equipment abroad. There are strategic reasons why we might not wish to encourage these long term projects.. These reasons, however, would be outweighed if the projects were considered important to the economic development of the country. In September 1947 the Iraq Government asked His Majesty’s Government to select for them a railway commission composed of three senior British experts to advise on the railway Administration long term plans and also on the co-ordinated development2 - 3 - devolopmont of railway, road and water transport* Uw^ortunately, however, before the team had been found the request was withdrawn owing to the change of government after the failure of the Portsmouth Treaty, and has not since been removed* (ii) Roads In 1947, the Iraq Government requested His Majesty^ Government to recruit for them six senior British road engineers to carry out the road development of the country* Although candidates wore found for all these posts, the Iraqis eventually only decided to appoint a Chief Road Engineer (Mr. J.B. Skinner of the Ministry of Transport) and to fill one other post for one year. Mr. Skinner has prepared a ton year road development plan for new first class roads linking the main towns of Iraq. The estimated cost of this programme is £14,500,000. Pirst priority will probably be given to completion of roads from Bagdad to Kirkuk and Bagdad to Basra. Mr. Skinner is insisting that this work should be put out to internationally reputed contractors and that competent British staff should be engaged to supervise it. At present, funds to embark on this programme arc not yet in sight* (iii) Civil Aviation. Air .Trans ;ort Iraqi Airways, the only air transport concern in Iraq operating scheduled services, was created in 1945 as a department of the Iraqi State Railways under the terns of an agreement signed in mid«*194-5&gt; B.O.A.O. under contract act as advisers to the Board of Iraqi Airways on ,s all technical, administrative control, working and management .matters'* in addition B,0*A*C* second key* staff and act as Iraqi Airways purchasing agents in the United KiKgdom. The airline operates international Services between various points in the middle East and to Rome, Athens, Marseilles and London; /and4 ~ and an internal service between Bagdad and Basra* Its fleet consists of three Vikingsand three de Haviland Doves. B.O.A.C. are at present owed £126,000 and their debt increasing monthly.at the rate of approximately £10,000. They may shortly seek our assistance in obtaining payment. Airfiel ds. The only airfields at present available for international air services are Bagdad (West) and Basra (Margil), neither of which is completely satisfactory. Bagdad is served by B.O.A.C. .and a number of local airlines and Basra by all the major international operators to India and the Par East. Bagdad (West) has recently been reconstructed by Wimpeys. At the invitation of the Iraqi G-overnment, a plan for a new airfield has been prepared by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, but there is no indication of any immediate action. As far as is known, there is no intention for the present to improve the existing airfield at Basra or to build a new one. Air traffic control services^ .. A certain amount of progress has recently been made towards the establishment of an air traffic control centre- in Iraq but it is extremely unlikely that either the Directorate of Civil Aviation, or the Basra Port Directorate will have sufficient funds available for serveral years at least, to meet the full recommendations made at the Middle East Regional Conference of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In the interim, in order to ensure the safe operation of international air services across Iraq, H.M^G, have been obliged to install and maintain .certain, communication facilities at Habbaniya and Bahrein.-, In addition the Royal Air force provide, the -entire meteorological service^ . (iv) P orts Basra is the only port of Iraq c At present the port Directorate is in debt to H.M.G. Consequently H.M.G. can continue to secure the appointment of a British Port Director. It is import nt for British shipping that the direction of this /port- 5 port should remain in competent and experienced hands, since it is responsible for the dredging which makes the use of Abadan possible (b) Flood Control and Irrigation A British Irrigation Development Commission under Mr # F#F. . xigh appointed early in 1^46 to draw up plans for the irrigation development of the country* The results of the Commission’s work (which is now almost completed) are described in greater detail in M*EJ*(0)(49)5 of the 1st April, Detailed plans for flood control and water storage works have been prepared and a tentative scheme for distribution works, lands drainage, electricity works and improved river navigation has been outlined* These plans will enable the area under irrigation in Iraq to be expanded from the present figure of less than 7 million acres to about 16 million acres* The total cost involved is estimated at £ 91*515 millions divided as follows:— Flood control and storage £22.375 million Irrigation development £35.26 tl Drainage £23.88 tl Power £6.35 II Navigation £3. 65 tl Development on this immense scale must necessarily take place gradually and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture The Irrigation Commission consider that the full development outlined above is unlikely to be required before the end of the century. Spread out over this period, the cost would involve an average annual expenditure of about £2 million only* Meanwhile, the immediate needs are flood control, limited irrigation development and drainage and reclamation in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a programme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £20 million, (or £2 million per annum), the estimated breakdown of which into dollars, dinars and sterling is as follows: £ 4.4 millions #19.3 millions I.D. 10.5 millions. Work has now already /begun- 6 - began oh the first stage of the water storage works which the Commission has prepared for. the Euphrates. An estimate of the cost of the first stages of these works in terms of foreign and local expenditure has been prepared for the International Bank as follows:- Project Completion of Kabbaniyah project. First Stage Wadi Tharthar project Gibraltar dam on Diyala Period for Sterling Completion cost Dollar cost Dinar ' cost” 3 years £300,000 ID 1,700,000 3 years £1,437,700 £6,483,200 ID 3,921,200 3 ' £1,256,000 £ 360,000 ID 1,288,000 T ot al £2,993,700 £6,843,200 ID 6,909,200 The Commission anticipates that a large proportion of the capital expenditure will .be recovered from the increase in land values resulting from the flood control and irrigation works, and that revenue sufficient to make the various projects productive ' will be obtained. They have submitted detailed proposals to the Iraq Government for a taxation system to cover the cost of the works, involving the levying of taxes on urban property, irrigated land and the crops produced. The Iraq Government has now decided to disband the Haigh Commission at the end of June. We are however urging them to postpone this disbandment attleast until after the proposed visit of the International Bank’s technical mission (see paragraph 5 below.) (c) Agriculture;- In addition to the possibilities of expanding irrigated cultivation, described in paragraph (a) above, there are great possibilities of agricultural development in the rainfall zone in Northern Iraq. In this area it is estimated that the total cultivable land is about 10 million acres, while the total land at present cultivated annually is only about 1 ^ million acres. There'There are also considerable’possibilities of livestock and fishery development* while agricultural pest control is an important heed in Iraq* Development of Iraq's agriculture however, oe conditioned by the basic factor of shortage of population* Apart from this factor, it will necessarily oe a long-term process, since the first requirements are (a) research into agronomic factors, pest control, livestock improvement, soil chemistry, use of fertilisers, plant breeding and plant physiology; (b) a great expansion of agricultural extension work; (c) an expansion of mechanisation; (d) land tenure reform, to break down the power of the Sheikhs, improve the position of the small cultivator, and make possible the development of State land; and, as a corollary to such reform, legislation to forestall speculation in land made cultivable by development* (i) Recruitme nt of Exper ts: In recognition of the importance of the first two requirements the Iraq Government have during the past three years asked His Majesty's Government to recruit for them some 25 senior British agricultural experts to serve in their Ministry of National Economy* After an extensive and difficult search, candidates were found for the majority of thes posts. In the event, however, the Iraqis only made six appointments. Of these, a botanist and a plant pathologist are now in Bagdad, but the former is leaving soon. An animal husbandry expert and an agricultural machinery expert were appointed but.the first has resigned and the contract of the second has already been terminated prematurely. An entomologist c.nd a soil technologist have been offered posts but have not yet accepted* All the other posts - including the most important of all, that of agronomist - have been either cancelled or held in abeyance. Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office, has now recommended that the /appointmentM Q » • appointment of the following foreign experts is essential to the agricultural development of Iraq: • 4 . ^ an agronomist a soil technologist a director of agricultural machinery an entomologist a soil conservation officer for the North an agricultural education adviser a forest officer (but see (d) below) an extension services officer a director of agricultural research an economic botanist an animal husbandry officer a sheep—breeding officer and wool expert an expert in co-operative organisations. (but see (h) below) (ii) Mechanisati on of AgricuIture: The Iraq Government at present owns about 100 tractors, and there are about I 4 OO tractors in private hands in the country. Taking into account the large numbers of tractors known to be out of action, the area under mechanised cultivation may be about 150,000 acres. In 19h7 the Government planned to increase the numbers of tractors in the country to 2 , 000 , but was unable to carry out this programme owing to shortage of funds. A bill has now been submitted to the Majlis to sot up an Administrative Council to control tho importation, sale and distribution of all agricultural machinery, thereby completely eliminating private trade. The Government has also submitted a request to the International Bank for a loan of an equivalent of 4 million dinars to enable it to carry out a ten year scheme for tho mechanisation of agriculture, involving an area of 460,000 acres. There should not be any great (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) (ix) (x) (xi) (xii) (xiii) difficulty«. 9 — difficulty in meoting this annual demand of equipment from the United Kingdom, (iii) Land tenure reform and l c and development legislation No Iraqi Government is at present willing to grapple with these measures* in view of the powerful vested interests involved. It is hoped that the Central Development Board* when set up* will be able to secure some action in.this field, (d) Forestry; In 1946 the Iraqi Government appointed Mr. G.W. Chapman of the Colonial Forost Service as head of their Forestry Department, and a junior British forestry officer was appointed this year to assist Mr. Chapman. During his three years in Iraq Mr. Chapman has laid the foundations for the sound forestry development of the country. He has set on foot a forestry survey, drafted forest legislation, established demonstration plantations and experiments, organised the recruitment and training of the Forestry Service and generally laid the basis for a sound policy of long-term development. The Iraq Government has now decided to renew Mr. Chapman’s contract at a considerably higher salary. (£2,22© p.a.). (see paragraph 6 below). (e) Health Services; During the past three years the Iraq Government has increased the number of British medical professors and specialists employed at the Royal Medical College, Bagdad, and in provincial hospitals. Of particular importance is the recent appointment of Dr. J.M. Watson, a specialist in bilharzia, as professor of biology. Dr. Watson as10 Dr. Watson has already written a report for the Iraq Government on bilharzia research and control and it is hoped that as and .when the irrigation schemes mature, he will be able to ensure that this vital aspect of public health, is adequately dealt with. Another important appointment which has ^ust been made is that of a Tuberculosis Expert, Dr*. Doherty. Meanwhile Iraq*s outstanding needs in the medical field are considered to be: (a) the appointment of a senior British public health expert to organise the Public Health Services of the country; (b) improvement of the nursing services; (c) expansion of teaching facilities in the basic medical sciences. As regards (b), we hope to persuade the Iraqi authorities to invite Dame Katherine Watt, Chiof Nursing Advisor to the Ministry of Health, to pay a visit of inspection to Iraq later this year. (f) Statistics; Dr. J. Murray, the Statistical Adviser to the B.M.E.O, has spent a considerable proportion of his time during the past two years in Iraq, where he has organised a Central Statistical Office for the Iraq Government and re-organised the statistical sections of all their Government Departments. As a result partly of his work the first census ever to be taken in Iraq has Just been completed with particular efficiency. (ita results -are not yet available). Dr. Murray 1 s work will prove of outstanding importance as detailed development planning proceeds, (g) Labour Mr. M.T. Audsley, the Labour Adviser to tho B.M.E.O. has paid a number of visits to Iraq during tho past three years(i) 11 years. The country has no Social Insurance system, no coherent Trade Union policy and no adequate labour ,va*Department. The development of a sound labour policy is considered to be urgent since the cost of living (which is now about 6-|- times what it was before the war), is out of all proportion to the wage structure of the country and this in its turn is completely unbalanced as between the various principal industrial undertakings. In these circumstances, there is growing distress and unrest. The Iraq Petroleum Company is, however, sotting an outstanding example p not only by the high rates of wages paid, but by the welfare amenities it provides and the action which it is taking to promote industrial trading, co-operation and trade union development. On Mr. Audsl«y , s advice the Iraq Government has now decided to appoint a British Social and Labour Adviser to prepare a comprehensive labour plan for the country and supervise its execution. A search for a candidate is now being made. Owing however to the inadequate salary offered it is considered necessary that we shall subsidise this post if it is to be suitably filled. (h) Co-operative Development In 1946, Mr. B.J. Surridge, at present Co-operative Advisor to the Colonial Office, was appointed by the Iraq Government to draw up a plan for agricultural co-operative development. No action, has, yet been taken on Mr. Surridge f s report, but it is hoped that the British labour adviser when appointed (see paragraph (g) above)will be able to follow it up. Meanwhile Mr, Marriott, Co-operative Adviser to the A.I.O.C., has paid valuable short-term visits to tho I.P,C. and the Iraqi State Railways.12 (i) Oil Production : Oil production in Iraq fell from 4.7 million, tons in 1946 to 3.5 million tons in 1948, as a result of the closure of the Haifa pipeline. If the oil companies 1 development plans go according to schedule, and the pipeline is re-opened soon, production should rise to 13.5 million tons in 1951 and 30 million tons in 1956. At the present rate of oil royalties this would mean that by 1951 , receipts would amount to nearly £6 million, and by 1956 to about £13 million. As a result of the current negotiations between the Iraq Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company for the revision of the latter’s concession, the oil royalty rate may well be increased by as much as 50 /^ or even more. (1) Establishment of a University at Bagdad . * (See Footnote 1) In 1948, Dr. A.E. Morgan of the British Council and Professor Sir Charles Darwin prepared for the Iraq Government a pi,an for the establishment of a University at Bagdad. No estimate of the cost was made, but it was pointed out that capital expenditure running into £ millions was likely to be required. In this plan attention was drawn to the importance of relating tho output of University graduates in the scientific and engineering fields to the output of trained technicians of the supervisory grades. It was therefore recommended that the establishment of the university should bo preceded by the building up of a system of technical and agricultural education, involving the re-organisation of the existing iingineering College, and the establishment of Agricultural and Commercial Colleges. A preparatory college to fill the present vacuum between the University and Secondary School standards should also be established. It is understood that the present Iraq Minister of Education- 13 - decided to adopt an alternative plan, established a University by the success of this project: • • (i) that a British principal to the University should be appointed; and (ii) that the University shall be a corporate organisation independent of the Ministry of Education. Establishment of a Central Development Board : In 19h7 it was suggested to the Iraq Prime Minister by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad and the Head of the B.M.E.O. that it was most important that a Central Development Board, composed of elder statesmen and senior experts who were outside politics and with funds under its direct control, should be set up to plan, co-ordinate and in certain fields carry out, the long-term development of the country and that a British secretary should be appointed to this Board* The latter would, we hoped, in fact largely direct its activities. We consider that the functions of the Board should be to survey the general resources of the State, to produce plans for the co-ordinated development of those resources, to draw up detailed plans for projects, to decide priority between projects and to arrange the ’execution of the projects in such a manner as_ may seom suitable to them. It should' have the power to propose legislation to be introduced V * a Minister, to provide for the administration of projects such as the distribution of newly irrigated land and the recovery of taxes or special charges from those benefiting from14 - from the projects. It should also have power to propose to the Council of Ministers legislation, including fiscal legislation, generally designodto promote development. It siiould have executive powers required for the completion of each project until the stage when it becomes a matter for normal administration, which must be done by the Government departments. It should have power to arrange for the flotation of companies to develop the resources of the State under which the State would contribute part of the capital and take part in the management. It should’ co-ordinate and control the development projects of the Iraqi State Railways and the Basra Port Directorate. The present Prime Minister has now decided Vo press &gt; ahead with the constitution of a Development Board and a Bill will very shortly be submitted to tho Majlis. We do n- jO, however, consider this Bill satisfactory. It doe's ‘ not give the Board a sufficiently comprehensive function, nor endow it with executive powers, and the funds to bo assigned to it are limited-to .such funds as the International Bank may make available. Moreover too much weight is given to political representation. His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad is pressing for the redrafting of tho Bill after the International Bank has been consulted, ■' The Iraqi Prime Minister lias not yet committed himself to the appointment of British Secretary to the Board. Financial situatim: (See.also O.N. (49)53 of 7th • . . February), The present financial situation ef Iraq is precarious. In 1947 the budget was comfortably balanced and the Government was proposing to. set aside a reserve for development. In 1943 the Government developed a budget deficit running at the rate of £1 million per month, which rendered- 15 - laC rondorud it very difficult to meet such important current commitments as payment of Civil Service salaries and payments to British contractors engaged on railway and irrigation capital works, (see paragraph 3 (a) and (b) above)). This state of affairs is the result of (a) bad budgeting combined with internal mal-administration and inefficiency and in particular the non-collection of taxes; and (b) the financial strain of the Palestinian war. The balance of payments situation is also very serious. Complete figures are not yet' available for 1948 but the deficit for the year on visible trade is likely to be in the region of £20 millions, imports being estimated at £45 million. The result has been that the generous sterling balance releases for which we provided In order to facilitate the development programme have been largely frittered away. The total of Iraq’s sterling balances (blocked and unblocked) is now only some £9 million in excess of the amount required for 100# currency cover. The Iraq Government have now tightened up import licence control, but they have not accepted a suggestion which we have made that British Customs Collectors should be appointed at Bagdad, and Basra, To meet the immediate crises the Iraq Government has had to resort to borrowing from the Banks and from the Iraq Currency Board to the extent of over £7-2- million. They have also received advances of oil royalties due up to the end of 1949 and they are hoping to obtain a substantial loan of some £millions from the I.P.C. as part of the arrangements for a revision of the Company’s concession. Meanwhile, the Government is making a determined effort to balance the budget for 1949-1950, and to provide a surplus. by- 16 - by means of increased taxation, and the redaction of departmental expenditure and the high cost of living allowances. As soon as we are satisfied that reasonable progress towards reform has been made, we propose to authorise the Iraq Government to raise a railway loan of £3 million in London to meet outstanding commitments to United Kingdom firms engaged in the projects described in paragraph 3(&amp;) (i) above. i'rom a short-term point of view, therefore, there is reasonable hope that the financial position will soon be stabilised. From a long-term point of view-, in'5-10 years’ time, Iraq should have all the funds she needs for development - and more - from oil royalty receipts (see 3(ij above). In the interim period, however, it will be essential for the Government to obtain a substantial foreign loan t j enable the railway, road and irrigation development programmes tj be carried out* Meanwhile the Governor of the National Bank has stated that when hfi visits this country shortly he proposes to engage a very high-grade British financial adviser who would visit IraQ few months in the year to advise both the Bank and the Minister of Finance, The Iraq Government have now made an informal application for a loan of £19.5 millions from the International Bank of which £11.2 millions are for flood control and irrigation development,£3*3 millions for road dovolopmont, and £5 millions for the railways. The.Bank is at present examining in detail the possibility of a loan to meet the sterling and dollar requirements and possibly also the requirements of local currency for the first, stage of the flood control schemes (see paragraph 3 (b) above.) They propose to send a teclinical Mission to Iraq in June to study the proposals in detail. It- 17 - ^St is unlikely that at this stage loens for road and railway development will be granted. Before any loans are authorised^ the Bank will neQd to be assured (i) that the Iraq Government is balancing its budget and setting its financial house in order, and (ii) that a properly constituted Development Board is being set up (see paragraph 4 above). 6. Terms of Serv ice for_Brl tish axpc rt s. The Iraq Government has a standard contract form for the employment of British officials, and its terms are generally considered satisfactory. Great difficulty iS| however, being experienced in filling outstanding posts offered by the Iraq Government because: (a) the salaries offered are inadequate, both in relation to salaries in the United Kingdom and to the cost of living in Iraq, The basic salary normally offered for senior experts (o.g. medical professors, labour advisers, agricult- ural experts) is £1800 p.a. and for junior experts possessing academic qualifications is £1200 p.a. The salaries offered for posts of the technical or foreman grade are normally about £ 900-1000 p.a. In addition there has hitherto been a high cost-of-living allowance for all these posts of £288 per annum, but according to information just received this allowance is now being halved. Meanwhile the rates of Iraq’s income tax levied on British officials are being increased. In- view of the financial situation described in paragraph 5 above the Government does not at present feel in a position to offer higher salaries, even for posts of- outstanding importance such as that of Labour Adviser (see paragraph 3(g) above)). (b) the length of contract offered (normally 3 years) is too short 7~ 18 - 7« Targets for farther devulopmdnt; W'. It will be seen from the above that during the past three years, plans for development and progress have been drawn up in many fields. The next stop - and a far more difficult one - is to implement these p&gt;lans. To enable this to be done it is essential: (a) That the proposed Central Development Board constituted on the lines which both we and the Internationa]. Bank consider desirable and with a British. Secretary of high calibre* should be set up v/ithout delay. (see paragraph 4 above): : * v (b) As ai* essential corollary to(a), that highly qualified foreign experts should be appointed to advise the main government departments on development policy and supervise its execution. (c) That a measure of administrative reform should be carried out, involving tax reforms, which tho IraqeGov.ornment has put through on paper, and the reform of the civil service. (d) To the extent that exports of. foodstuffs- be aimed at, that Iraqi prices should be brought into line with world prices. The targets for development which it will be the duty of the Central DaveloiDment Board to consider to put in order of priority and in certain cases to execute may be summarised as follows:- (a) to carry out the plans prepared for capital development works in flood control and irrigation. (b) to appoint a foreign transport commission to examine the various projects for airfield, roads, railway, I.W.T. and port development and to draw up i£ ate priorities for implementation within, say three and ten years(i) - 19 - yoars respectively. (c) to embark on a co-ordinated long-term policy of agricultureal development involving large scale research work, agricultural extension work and the introduction of mechanisation and for this purpose to appoint eleven foreign experts; (d) to stimulate the Government to introduce land tenure reforms for existing cultivated land. (e) to draw up plans for th tenure and colonisation of newly developed land - e.g., consider development by moans of public utility corporations or regional boards; (f) to follow up the plans for forestry development, worked out by Mr. Chapman. (g) to follow up the Surridge report on co-operative development and to appoint a foreign co-operative expert; X ' (kT to prepare plans for the development of adequate Public Health Services, to appoint a British expert tb^o-arry them out; and to arrange for Dame Katherine Watt, Chief Nursing Adviser to the Ministry of Health, to pay a visit of inspection to Iraq this year.- 20 (i) To press ahead with the 'building up of a sound system of technical and agricultural training and of pre-University education as the 'basis for the establishment of a University at Bagdad; to arrange for such foreign experts as may he desirable to visit Iraq to advise on the promotion of particular branches of technical and pre-University education r and to appoint a British principal x to the University. ^See footnote (j) to stimulate the G-overnment to embark on a progressive labour policy in consultation with the British labour adviser who is to be appointed* (k) To appoint a British expert to supervise the Government statistical organisation. Recommendations for action by His Ma.iesty y s Government * (a) We should continue to urge the Iraq G-overnment to set up immediately a Development Board on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 above and should do our best to find a suitable candidate for the Secretaryship. (b) Since Iraq as a member of the sterling area draws her dollar requirements (which will include the servicing and repayment of any loan by the International Bank) from the Sterling area central reserves and our oil interests in Iraq give her a strong bargaining weapon in the negotiation of hard currency target agreements, we should, as far as. is practicable within the framework of our export policy meet from U.K. sources Iraq's requirements of capital goods for the development programmes# (c) We should in principle encourage the making of a loan to Iraq by the International Bank and should give the Bank all possible support and assistance vis-3-vis the Iraqis. The detailed arrangements as regards a Bank loan will be for consideration in the light of recommendations made, in due course, by the Bank's technical experts. /(d)- 21 - (d) We should concert with the United States Government ^d the International Bank, an agreed list of conditions which 'both they and we should attach to any financial or other assistance which it is decided to give to Iraq. These conditions should include, e.g. the satisfactory constitution of the Central Development Board, the establishment of the internal finances on a sound footing, the appointment of British experts to certain key posts, and (in the case of a railway loan) the carrying out of a transport survey by a foreign transport commission. (See pargraph 7(b) above)). (e) We should consult the United States Government on the question of the provision of experts under all the headings in paragraph 7(a) to (j) above, with a view to determining which could most appropriately be provided from British and which from United States sources - bearing in mind our special commitment under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. (f) We should consider the possibility of improving the conditions of service of British experts in Iraq, by (i) the working out of secondment arrangements from the United Kingdom, and (ii) subsidisation of certain posts in particular the post of labour adviser - see paragraph 3 (g) above. (g) since United States experts are most unlikely to be attracted by the terms at present offered. We should consult the United States Government on the question of the improvement of terms of service. (h) In the field of education we should encourage the x Iraqi Government: /See footnote l/, (i) to expand technical educational facilities by re—organising the existing Snineering College and establishing Agricultural and Commercial /Colleges22 Collages as the first star; towards tha establishment of a Un 1 v*j r s i t y; (ii) to establish a preparatory collage to prepare sec ondary s t a dant s for the University and Technical Colleges; (ill) to invito foreign experts to pay short visits to Iraq as may be required •$ . advise on the organisation of the Technical Colleges and the P reparat ory C o.lloge • (iv) severely to restrict the intake into the University itself and maintain its standard at a high level; (v) to appoint a British principal to the University, * £ 2 °^^, J ^e 1 This paper does not include reference to the question of training of technicians of the craftsman and foreman grades, which is being dealt with in a separate paper covering +.ho Middle Iflast as a whole.M.E.(O) (49) r4 10th MAY. J \9k9 CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) COMMITTEE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST Note by the Joint Secretaries We circulate herewith the Memorandum (originally circulated in draft as M.E.(o) (49) 9)) in which are incorporated the revisions agreed by the Committee at its 1st and 2nd Meetings oh April 28 th and May 5th respectively. (signed) M.M» DU MERTON A.G. MAITLAND• CABINET OFFICE, S.W.1 . 10th May, 1949*S^ORST ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST For the purposes of this Paper, the Middle East is considered to comprise Persia and the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant States, Iraq, Transjordan, the Nile Basin from Egypt to Ethiopia, and the former Italian Colonies* The problem of economic and social development in the Middle East is at once an opportunity, a responsibility and a challenge. 2* Danger of C•mmunism Communist influence has recently been extended over a large part of China. There is a grave risk of its further extension into South East Asia. If the Middle East were also to fall under Communist control the cause of the democratic countries would suffer a cripp ling bl*w. The economic recovery of the United Kingdom and Western Europe would be gravely .affected. The way would be opened for the spread «f Communism into the rest of Africa. The p«siti*n of Turkey, Greece and Italy would be largely undermined- The ability of Russia to wage a successful war against the West would be greatly increased. The defence of the United Kingdom in the event of war would be compromised. 3. But we must face the fact that many of tie conditions which favoured the extension of Communism in China exist in the Middle East. H.M. Government were largely responsible for the emergence of most of the Middle East count* 1 - ries as independent and self-governing peoples. /But- 2 - But the transition from centuries of Turkish misrule to self- government under modern world conditions is a difficult one# Corruption, inefficiency and poverty are still endemic* The standard of living of the mass of the people is appallingly low, and the contrast with the- wealth of the small and selfish ruling classes is glaring. In spite of the contradiction between the principles of the Moslem religion, and of Communism, there are almost classic opportunities for Communist agitation by the exploitation of hardship, chaos and discontent. The failure of their efforts in Palestine has left the Arab countries in a state of demoralisation offering a field for dictatorial adventurers# 4* To prevent the Middle Ea$t falling behind the Iron Curtain must be a major objective, of our policy and therefore merits a high priority in effort and contribution. 5# The extent of that effort and contribution must, it is recognised, necessarily be limited or conditioned by the competing claims on United Kingdom resources from other areas in which His Majesty^ Government has major political or economic interests such as Europe, the Par East and jnore especially the qther countries of the Commonwealth towards whom we have special obligations and our own Colonies for which we have a direct responsibility. Within the limits of the resources that can be made available, however, there is a clear case for doing as much as possible to further the economie and social development of the Middle East countries. 6,- Positive Opportunities The Communist danger cannot be met by a negative or passive approach, but by grasping the positive opportunities which exist* Middle East Governments are alive to the need for measures to stem and turn back the advance f* Communism. But negative measures of mere repression are not enough; nor are the drafting and passing into lav/ of paper plans for economic development and social r» improvement. Our aim must be to encourage Governments to take positive steps to put the needed reforms into effect and to rgdore /7...the conditions in which. Coninunism flourishes. 7. Large areas of the Middle East were in the ^nast prosperous and fertile. By means of progressive policies carried out under vigorous leadership they could become so again. Major opportunities exist for irrigation, flood control and for increased agricultural production in Egypt, the Sudan, Syria and Iraq. The continued and expanded exploitation of oil resources ought in the coming years to afford great wealth to Persia, Saudi Arabia, the Arab Sheikhdoms and Iraq. These developments v/ill result in an increased demand for capital equipment from outside sources. The raising of the 'general standard of living will also in time increase the importance of the Middle East as a market for consumer goods 0 8. The United Kingdom has a very considerable financial stake in the Middle East. For example, if is estimated that the replacement value of the fixed assets (e.go refineries, pumps, pipe-lines, docks, transport, housing, hospitals, dispensaries, etc.) of British oil companies in the Middle East amounts to some £250 million. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company represents our greatest and most important single overseas investment. Our sales of Middle East oil to American Companies and to hard currency markets in Europe and elsewhere are a vital element in our overall balance of payments# 9« The contribution which it is hoped Middle East: oil will moke to the recovery of the United Kingdom and Europe is illustrated by the following figures:-4- Plow of oil to Western Eurooe T in million tons) Source 1228 194§ 1951 (estimated) Middle East 9.4 (23.3$) 18 (38$) 48.7 (82$) U.S.A. 12 (29.6$) , 5 - 3 V (11.4$) 2.1 (3.6$) Rest of W. Hemisphere 19 (47.1$) 8.5 (14.3$) 10* rhe Middle East is the source of* supply of certain essential commodities apart from oil. l&gt;r example, Egypt and the Sudan are the only source of the particular types of long- staple cotton required for the production of the high-grade textiles on which Lancashire r s future depends. It is probable that in the course of the.next season we will be spending as much as £30 million(at present prices)on Egyptian cotton and about £10-£12 million on cotton from the Sudan. The Sudan, too, supplies about 90$ of the world’s requirements of gum arabic. The possibilities of expanding Middle East production of meat, oilseeds, fish and cereals are considerable. The area as a whole could become one of the more important sources of the supply of hides and skins* 11. The Middle %ast joins three continents and two oceans. Its fifty million or so inhabitants straddle important cc.: .uni cat ion rout -q between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Par East. The area has proved as vital for air and radio communication as for camel-caravans and steamships. 1 2* Machine ryL_for dealing with Middle East Policy In September 1945 the Foreign Secretary called a Conference of Britishrepresentatives in the Middle East, to survey the whole field /of-5- of our policy in the area and to make recom mendations on future lines of action. The recommendations which he then submitted to the Cabinet (C.P.(U5)l?4 of September 17th, 1945)# and which received their approval, called amongst other things for the following:- (a) the establishment of the British Middle East Office in Cairo, one of whose responsibilities would be to develop and ensure the co-ordination of British fin ancial, economic and social policy and the Middle East region. (b) the setting up of machinery for the co-ordination of Middle East policy in London. i3 At the same time it was agreed (c) that economic development and social betterment must go forward hand in hand; (d) that Hi s Ma;jesty f s Government should encourage Middle East Governments to draw up their own plans for economic development and should offer to place at their disposal technical and specialist assistance to help them in formulating their schemes; (e) that we should steer local develop ment plans along lines in conformity with the limitations imposed on ourselves by our own financial and supply situation and with the needs of the region as a whole. •j 4 As a result of the first recommendatioa /thethe British Middle East Office was duly established with a Development Division to which were appointed advisers in agriculture, forestry and soil con servation, animal husbandry, health, labour, statistics and entomology* A description of their activities is given in paragraph 23. The services of the Middle East representatives of the Treasury, Ministry of Euel and Power and Ministry of Civil Aviation are also available to the Plead of the BritisPi Middle East Office. The second recommendation led to the setting up of a 'Ministerial Committee under the chairmanship of the Foreign Secretary and a Middle East (Official) Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State. In fact, tPie Middle East Committee w»f Ministers has never met, while the Middle East (Official) Committee has met on only eight occasions. The inactivity of tPiese Committees lias been mainly due to the fact that the preoccupation of Middle East countries with Palestine has made it impossible to achieve much progress with schemes of development. For the same reason, plans which were discussed in 1947 in Wash ington for Anglo-American economic cooperation in the Middle ^ast (see paragraph 19 ) have not yet been fully implemented. 160 There is now however some reason to •ope that a settlement in Palestine may soon be reached. Moreover, the attitude to us of most of tPie Middle East countries has taken a turn for the better and there is reason to hope /that,- 7 - that, partly in view of the possibilities opened up by President Truman’s Fourth Point, Middle East Governments may be prepared to pay more attention to economic development and social reform# The who^o problem has taken on a new urgency as a result of the emergence of Israel and the expulsion from their homes of over 800,000 Palestinian Arabs, while the economic future of Greater Transjordan and the financial stability of Iraq are ma.tters of increasingly grave concern. 17. The time is now ripe therefore for taking stock of the situation, for reviewing our machinery both at home and in the field, and for considering how further progress can best be achieved. 18. As a first step, the Middle East (Official) Committee has been reconstituted, under the chairmanship of an Assistant Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office. (See C.P.(49)83 of April 11th, 1949)• The Middle East (Official) Committee has in turn set up a Working Party, under Foreign Office chairmanship,' consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the Central Economic Planning Staff, together with representatives of other Department's concerned with particular subjects under discussion. 19* Attitude of the United States Government The United States Government has reached parallel and similar conclusions about the importance of economic and social development in the Middle East. The agreed results of discussions between the United States and His Majesty’s Government held in Washington in October 1947 were set out in (ME(0)(47)28 of November•11th, 1947)* Latterly the State Department have begun to take a ’renewed interest in the subject, partly perhaps as a means of restoring American prestige in the Arab world from the depths to which it had fallen as a result of United States policy in Palestine. The State Department take the Arab refugee problem as their point of departure, believing that only through development schemes will it prove possible to make any solid progress over solving the refugee /question.•»question, and at the same time 'believing that a contribution to the resettlement of the refugees will bo the form of financial assistance to the Middle East most likely to appeal to Congress, We have I* already had informal conversations with State Department officials on the subject and while ready to- accept their general approach to the problem, are still considering our attitude on details, and in any case will have to make certain reservations on the scope of United Nations action in Middle East development, (See M. B.(0)(49)12 of May 5th, 19h9.) 20, Action - Three Phases Measures for economic and social development may be regarded as falling into three phases *- Survey, Planning and Implementation, 21, The initial phase of Survey has now been virtually completed and the time has come when we should pass into the phases of Planning and Implementation, which to some extent overlap, 22, Phase I - Survey , A brief resume may be useful of what has been accomplished over the past few years in respect of economic and social development in the Middle East, 23, To start with, certain economic fields were surveyed by the Middle East Supply Centre to 'form the subject of a number of basic reports. Since the establishment of the British Middle East Office in 1945 the members of its Development Division have toured the area and submitted reports to the Governments concerned, with recommendations covering their various fields. These fields include general agriculture, forestry and soil conservation, animal husbandry, health, labour and industrial conditions, locust control and statistical organisation, A War Office Working Party made a survey of development possibilities in Tripolitanla, Cyrenaica, Eritrea and Somalia early in 1947« The Agriculture Animal Husbandry Forestry‘Qijd v 8oii conservation; -and-'Health Advisers of the British- Middle JSast Office have 'also visited and reported on. the ex-Italian Colonies. The oil companies have been at work prog$Scting and developing/9* developing the oil resouroes 01 the area, and ■building up weli'are services on a scale unprecedented in the Middle Mast* Oountry-wide surveys have been made by the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb' and Partners in Syria and the Lebanon* In Persia particular aspects of development have been surveyed by Sir Alex ander Gibb &amp; Partners and the American firm of Morrison-Knudsen, and a general survey is now being undertaken by the American consortium. Overseas Consultants, Inc*, in co-operation with Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. Detailed surveys have been made by British consultants of flood control and irrigation in Iraq, where plans have also been formulated in such fields as railway and road development, construction of bridges, etc. Surveys of Transjordan undertaken by the former Mandatory Government and this work has been continued by the British Development Officer, who has also carried oul; land settlement* In the field of social welfare and administration a number of special reports have been made, e.g. a British expert has advised on co-operative development in Iraq and British and I.L.O. experts on co-operative development in Persia; in the Lebanon a British expert has drawn up a scheme of national social insurance and in Syria another British expert has advised on the reform of the taxation system. Even the feudal Government of Saudi Arabia has now accepted British advice in the medical field, and has given facilities to the British Middle ^ast Anti-Locust Unit to carry out a series of large scale anti-locust ‘ campaigns in recent years* The Egyptians have indicated their agreement to participate with us in the execution of the comprehensive schemes /forfor tho utilisation of the Nile Waters and the Egyptian Parliament has voted £E42 million as a contribution to the combined hydro-electric station and. dam at Owen Palls* Egypt, although more advanced than the other countries in technical knowledge, consults the British Middle East Office on questions of health, locust control, forestry and labour relations. Broadly speaking it may be said that most of the area has been surveyed and there is now sufficient knowledge of what c-an and should be done# 24. The ideas are set out in numerous reports. The problem today is not so much to search for further ideas as to put into effect those ideas which have been patiently accumulated. 25• Phase 2: Planning Phase 2 is in many ways the most dif ficult phase of the whole operation. It comprises all the stages between the general survey (Phase l) and the request for tenders for specific projects (which is the beginning of Phase 3)* It. may perhaps be divided into three main parts: (a) the establishment by the Govern ments concerned of the appropriate machinery for the proper planning / of development. (b) . the selection of the most suitable projects out of those surveyed, in relation to the financial and . economic resources, of the country /concerned-11- concerned and to the background of regional and world economic development, and the establishment of priorities. (c) decisions by the Governments con cerned with regard to the extent and method of utilising internal resources and outside financial assistance. 26,TbcAnnex t 0 this Paper contains a short list of (a) the surveys which have been carried out in the various fields of economic and social development and (b) of specific major projects which have been surveyed. The list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. The main problem which faces us now is -the transition from Phase I to Phase 2 and it is on this that our diplomatic and technical effort will have to be concentrated in the immediate future# 2?. Phase 5 - Implementation. The obstacle in the path of implant ation of these schemes are formidable. Inertia, inefficiency and corruption have to be overcome. Lack of trained personnel will be a serious difficulty. Encouragement and assistance will be required from without. 2g. It is for consideration how far most of the Middle East countries are in fact capable of undertaking the requisite work themselves. None the less, there are strong arguments in favour of their beinp; encouraged and assisted to assume the responsibility of doing so and thus acquiring the practice and the pride of tackling their own problems themselves, rather than having them carried out entirely by /foreignerss A -1 2 - foreigners or by international organisations# 29 # The' fact must be faced that the achieve ment of any effective and lasting progress will probably necessitate in many cases: (a) the reorganisation of the administrat ive machine and tax system; (b) social reform, including reform of land tenure systems; . , . (c) a settled policy of land use# 30. But it must be recognised that such reforms will involve social, political and economic readjustments which it will take many years to bring about, 'Meanwhile our first aim should be to persuade the Middle Bast Governments: (a) to set up, where practicable. Central and probably also Area Development Boards, with independent finance, to determine priorities and push ahead with individual projects; (b) 'to undertake, as soon as possible, with or without a Central Development Board, 'demonstration” projects, to provide a beginning and a means of ascertaining- what problems and what expenditure will be involved in any larger projects# 31# A combination of two methods will be required to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the local Governments:- (a) measures of persuasion, e.g, diplomatic pressure-, and education, demonstration and publicity te bu&gt;Id up a body of public opinion which /GovernmentsGovernments cannot ignore, and (b) offers of assistance which can be withheld if Governments are obstructive. Such offers can take the fQJcni of financial assistance, material supplies, technical ex— pertise and training facilities. 32. Though most of the Governments concerned should be able by a reform of the taxation system to meet their needs in local currency and should in som©cases find no difficulty in a few years* time in meeting their needs for foreign currency, nevertheless they are likely to require considerable foreign financial assistance in the immediate future to prime the pump. It must of course be borne in mind that the sources of such assistance arc limited and have other calls upon them, while the difficulties of His Majesty’s Government at the present moment in this respect need no emphasis. Nevertheless, the immediate needs are relatively small and, given stable conditions, it should not be beyond the capacity of many of the Middle East countries to meet the interest on such loans as are likely to be required in the next year or so. Some of the materials required too are at present world scarcities, and as long as this state of affairs lasts it will be necessary to ensure that the Middle East countries get their share. Finally, these countries will need foreign advisers to help in such matters as reforming their administrations, carrying out research and training, improving social conditions and executing such projects as may be determined. 33 . International Organisations Particular importance attaches to the question whether en couragement and assistance to Middle East countries should be afforded principally (a) by His Majesty’s Government and by the United States Government or (b) through the medium of the United Nations and its associated organisations. Some of these, e.g. the International Bank, the World Health Organisation, Organisation UNESCO and the Food and Agriculture Organisation are already at work in the Middle East. /3U.«•14 - 34. The Foreign Secretary has expressed a. very strong preference for course (a). If this policy is adopted it will not, of course, mean that there is no role for the United Nations Organisationsto play* Assistance from the International Bank will bo a vital re quirement and it is to be hoped that the Bank will play a major part in Middle East development* . The other Specialised Agencies of the United Nations and in particular the F.A.O. should also be encouraged to play a more effective part in giving technical assistance and advice to Middle Ea.st countriesj in this work they should supplement and should not overlap with the work of the British Middle East Office* We should in general strongly discourage any tendency for the United Nations or the Specialised Agencies to under take executive functions, unless there are reasons to the contrary in any particular case, such as the resettlement of the Arab refugees* We do not wish to see schemes such as the Nile Waters and the Iraqi Irrigation and Flood Control Projects undertaken under United Nations auspices. 35• Co-operation wi th the United States Government As stated in paragraph 19 informal conversations have already taken place with the State Department on Middle East development and Arab refugees, and it would be desirable to continue them. Such a discussion would be a logical sequel to the Washington Talks of October 1947 and to subsequent contacts with the State Department. 36* Pec ommenda tions (a) the principle should bo endorsed that economic development and social reform in the Middle East are a very important interest of His Majesty’s Government. (b) Hia Majesty's Government should use all its influence with the Middle East Governments towards the implementation of projects for economic development* (c) the Middle East (Official) Committee and its Working Party should study, country by country, in the light of their economic situation, practical projects with a view to assessing those which /in...- 15 - in their view, are likely to be of greatest benefit to the Middle East peoples and in particular which are capable of early reali sation, (in this connection it is considered that, whilst financial and other implications must continuously be borne in mind, the only realistic method of approach to the general problem is first to make a study of such projects and then to proceed to consider how they should be financed. But it is not at present possible or desirable to attempt to reach any conclusions in advance of the completion of detailed studies aimed at assessing the cost, both financial and economic, of desirable developments and the extent to which it will or will not be possible to meet them from the resources of the countries concerned, by borrowing from the International Bank or by making use of such bodies as the Overseas Pood Corporation, Above all, it is important to avoid the dagner of preparing elaborate and ambitious paper plans which will be incapable of realisation), (d) requests from the Middle East countries for British financial, industrial and technical assistance in the implementation of plans for such projects should be accorded as high a degree of priority as the circumstances appear to warrant. In this connection it should be borne in mind that several of the Middle East countries come to us for their dollar requirements and their demands will be all the heavier if we cannot meet their requirements for capital equipment from the Sterling Area, (e) We should continue the conversations which have started with the United States Government and endeavour to enlist their material support in promoting both development projects and the resettlement of the Arab refugees, (f) While the policy of co-operation between the British Middle East Office and the United Nations Specialised Agencies (e.g. the F.A.O, the International Bank of the W.H.O.) should continue, their assistance to Middle East should be supplementary to should not interfere with that administered direct by His Majesty^ Government and the United States Government,/(a)..♦ ANNEX A.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST 2. FUTURE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE 1- 1 - ECONOMIC SOCIAL EE^/ELOx I ENT IN THE MI.TjLE E^ST V 1 . (Previous Reference' K.E.(0)(49) is.t Meeting, Minute o) The Committee resumed their consideration of a Report hy the Working party of M.E.(0)C (M.E.(0)(49) 9 regarding economic and social development in the Middle East, together with certain amendmants and additions circulated since their previous meeting as M.E.(0)(49) 9 (Revise). In the course of discussion certain further amendments were proposed, of which the following were the most important ( a ) Paragraph 22 . It was agreed that some prominence should be given to the Italian Colonies and that reference should be made to certain survey work already carried out in those areas by a War Office Working party early in 1947 and by Advisers of the British Middle East Office, A list of the War Office Working party Reports concerned should be added to ^,nnex C. (b) Paragraph 55 . The Committee also considered a re-draft of paragraph 33 (after the fourth sentence), which was proposed by the Foreign Office and of which copies were handed out to those present. This re-draft, wdiich was agreed with minor amendments, had the purpose of defining our attitude towards the specialised agencies of the United Nations. ( 0 ) iumexes ^ and B . Sir J. Troutbeck proposed that the form of the paper for submission to the Official Committee on Economic Development Overseas would be improved by the omission of annexes b. and B (Terms of reference and Summary of the Foreign Office - state Department talks in 1947 respectively), with appropriate adjustments in the text (e.g. in paragraphs 17, 18, and 23). In view of the fact that Annex ?B in particular had been overtaken by events, the Committee agreed to this proposal. The C ommi11 e e:- (1) Subject to the various amendments approved by the Committee, agreed M.E.(0)(49)9. (2) Invited the Chairman, in conjunction with the Secretariat, to consider the appropriate • method of submitting M.E.(0)(49)9 to the Official Committee on Economic Development Overseas. 2. FUTURE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIRMAN said that the Working party already had a number of papers in hand which would be submitted to the Committee in due course. .'is regards further studies yet to be undertaken, he thought that the Working Party should be given some latitude to select for prior treatment those which seemed to them to be most important or urgent. Apart- 2 - from the Country Studies, to which he would refer later, three papers were, at the moment in preparation, as follows;- (i) ’ Training and Education in the Middle East . ^ (ii) Development Boards in the Middle East . (iii) Middle East Oil . The Committee’s attention was also drawn to: (iv) Report on C onsultants for Large Dev elopment Schemes Overseas. TgEN. S7T/9 (Revise) of l9th Apr.il, 1949 ), This had been prepared by the ^d Hoc Working Party on the Economic Development of Under Developed Countries and was of considerable interest to the Committee. Sir J. TROUTBECK said that a number of other topics had been proposed for study and the Committee might wish to note them now and possibly make preliminary comments on them. ( v ) The Utilisation of Oil Royalties for the financing of icvclopment schemes . (vi) Expansion of Social and Welfare policies of British Oil and other C mnpanies in the Uidd7-e East . (vii) Possibilities for the Overseas Food Corporation in the Middle East. Various suggestions had been put forward from time to time on this matter which could no doubt be collated and submitted' in due course to the Committee. (viii) Exports by other Q.E.E.C. Countries to the Middle East against Sterling . This was a matter which the Treasury would no doubt wish to note and consider before any work were undertaken by the Working Party. (ix) Middle East Fisheries Development . (x) • Population Trends in the Middle East . This subject was rather a matter for long-term study and it might be advisable to' consult with other Committees, e.g. Par Eastern (Official) Committee, to decide whether the study should be conducted on a regianal or wider basis. Moreover, it impinged on the refugee population question. As, however, it would take considerable time to complete, there would be no objection to making a start with the collection of suitable information. The Committee then considered the proposed country-by country studies referred to in paragraph 35 (c) (Recommendations) of M.E.(0)(49)9.) Those dealing with Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, Persia and Egypt were well advanced and the Working Party, who were being assisted on this work by Mr. Crawford of the B.M.E.O., expected to complete them very shortly. The Committee were informed that each Study would make a number of tentative recommendations which would have to be balanced against the recommendations made for all the other countries concerned. It was agreed that the Oountry Stuaies should be, circulated to the Committee as soon as they were completed by the Working party and that Departments should send in their preliminary comments on each, as received, in anticipation of a further meeting of the Committee.-3 regards other possible subjects for study, the following proposals were considered:- T ( x i) Export prices of diddle East Foodstuffs . MR. HhIG asked whether the Committee might wish to consider what assistance' or remedies could be proposed to enable countries like Iraq to bring their export prices for foodstuffs more into line with world prices. It was agreed, however, that it might be difficult to isolate the Middle East countries from other countries and that the study might lead the Committee into matters which were more the concern of the Overseas Negotiations Committee. Nevertheless it was a subject which perhaps the B.M.E.O. might be asked to bear in mind. (xii) Development in Israel . It was agreed that a paper on the Israeli plans for economic development and self-sufficiency and their possible repercussions on the Middle East would be of great interest, but it was considered that the necessary material for preparing a report would not be available until some time after the new Minister had taken up his post in Israel. The Committee (1) Took, note of the proposed studies listed above and invited the Working party to proceed on the lines agree! in liscussion; (2) Invited Departments to send to the Secretariat their preliminary comments on the country studies when circulated, for consideration at a further meeting of the Committee.

COPY NO OA.BINET MIDDLE EAST (OFFICIAL) GOi.iHITTEE Pli'.3WTTT,P.MENT OP ARAB REFUGEES IN THE JEZIREH AREA. IN SYRIA. Memorandum Ly the Foreipxi Office The British Middle East Office at H.M. Legation at Damascus were recently asked to send their best estimates of the total number of refugees who could be resettled in the Jezireh area in Syria, the time which it would take to settle them and the cost involved. (See paragraph 4 of M.E.(o) (49) 4). Numbers who might be resettled 2. Sir Herbert Stewart, the Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office, has now prepared the estimates attached at Annex A of the numbers who might be resettled. These estimates vary from between 100,000 to 245,000 people according to the area assumed to be cultivable and the degree of mechanisation proposed. It is considered, however, that it would be unwise to plan on the basis oi resettling more than 150,000 persons. One of the difficulties in making these estimates is that it is uncertain how much of the land shown as ’’cultivable waste” in the Syrian Government’s official statistics ;see shcedule attached at Annex B) has a high enough rate of rainfall to allow for settlement. A large part of the 1,796,000 acres shown as cultivable may lie in the low rainfall area. Problems involved in resettlement 3. Sir Herbert Stewart recommends that settlement in this area should be based on a combination of mechanised and animal agriculture. He points out, however, that it may prove impossible to buy sufficient ploughing animals for this purpose. 4. One of the greatest difficulties which will be encountered in settling this area is likely to be the question of land ownership. As far as can be ascertained the land, except near the towns, is State Domain, but certain tribes and important Sheikhs have acquired rights v/hich it may prove very difficult to upset and which in the unsettled state of the Jezireh area cannot be ignored. Cost of resettlement r. # as a very rough guess the initial outlay involved in resettlement is estimated as follows Surveys Tents (It i £50,000 It is assumed that the settlers will gradually build their own houses) £ 400,000 £50,000 Wells, etc. /Tractors2 Tractors (1,000 for a million aores), farm machinery and farm animals : £900 , OOOto £1,400,00^ Motor transport £100,000 Unforeseen contingencies . £200,000 ' o Total £1,700,000 to £2,100,000 It is considered that the Syrian Government would be unable to make any part of this cost available from its own resources and that the total would have to be supplied from outside sources. Timing of resettlement 6. It i s considered that the first step should be for a technical commission to visit the Jezireh area and study conditions on the spot. The commission’s work might take six months. After that settlement might take up to two years before completion although it might be possible to settle some parties before the commission completes its work. Settlement should start at the time of year when settlers will have time to shake down and get their first crop as soon as possible. Other resettlement possibilities in Syria 7. Other possibilities which require examination are: (a) Irrigation settlement on the Khabur river. Nothing certain i s at present known about, this. (b) Employment of refugees on the construction of roads from Aleppo to the Jezira. These roads will be necessary if the Jezira area is to be opened up and might provide a valuable form of interior relief works. (c) Figures of the rural population given in the report of Sir A. Gibb and Partners, suggest that the Homs-Hama area is lightly populated. There may, therefore, be resettlement possibilities . there.—— ANNEX_B XL SYRIA l ■1 r axr t 6978 | , (THIS DOCUMENT IS 'X'H3 i HOPERIJY ORJilS BE I X-.-O'fM 10 MAJESTY’S GOVEEMiffiNT) &lt; ' CONPID I Dr.'ll AL g'+u *; | ^ f ■e 6 ?Y NO.

My telegram No. 4222 /'^f April 13: Arab refugee^# Please inform the State Department that we have now considered the plan of action proposed by Mr. McGhee. We are in general agreement with it but feel that it requires development in the following sense. 2 . in our view it would be a mistake to proceed on the assumption that we can at the same time confirm the Conciliation Commission as the executive authority in this matter and avoid all United Nations control over the team of experts which is to carry out the assessment of the various development schemes. We feel that the United Nations part in the solution of the problem shouH be entirely overt and that the part played by experts should be free of United Nations supervision. We do however recognise the need for an initial United Nations impulse and suggest that the following plan of operations might suit both our Governments^ (1) A statement by the Conciliation Gonmission of the nature of the problem and its possible solution along the lines discussed with Mr, McGhee. We see from New York telegram No. I 83 Saving that the Conciliation Commission in their second Progress Report are already thinking along these lines and we should imagine there would be little difficulty in arranging a suitable broad cast or other public statement by Mr. Etherdge or the Gonmission as a whole to set the. development survey in motion. /(*&gt;CONPIDIUNTIAL Ils.Q* ^QlQgram lj. 7 U4 t o Washington Govern-nSt^woulfrosponfto and Bis Majesty's tins h . hicrh 4.4 0 ^PP^alj tho formop'appoiu-* pro 1 cctsqa mlah?\ 0Xp ?^ ^amination of such dovolopmont projuCi;3 as might bo capable ultimately of absorhino- rofne-nn prlv^' 0°^^ ‘^^^i^p/eco^ondafions ^ ho tShon ^hy or hv 4 s finance (inclvAiog the Intcmational B^k) od Ag'Gii'-iea such as the Pood aud Agrioult-uivo^ unaer J h0 h °a&lt;llng of tachnioaX assistance, as i ^ as GQvcmmonts thorns elves in duo course» The erroim Thn 1 rlT?

Hero there seerr seem to be excellent reasons for reverting to full and overt United Nations authority and.we should suppose that a specialised agency would provide the best machinery for this type of work which is, after all, very similar to what is now going on in 3urope.

ECONOMIC AW SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST y* The Committee considered a Memorandum 'by the Working Party of the Middle East (official) Committee (M.E.( 0)(49)9) . on Economic and Social Development in the Middle East. SIR JOHN TROUTBECK said that the Memorandum stated very clearly the major points of the case for a further drive in the Middle East area. In one' important aspect, namely the resumption of discussions with the U.S. Authorities, the Memorandum was, however, not fully up-to-date. Discussions had recently taken place in the Foreign Office with Mr. McGhee, Adviser to the State Department on Arab Refugees. The state Department had 'been taking a renewed interest in the problem of economic development in the Middle East, their point of departure being the Arab Refugee Problem. Their approach was that only through development schemes would any progress be made towards solving the refugee problem, and they thought that, when it came to asking for financial assistance to the Middle East, the line most likely to appeal to Congress and to secure the involvement of the U.S. in the general problem was the re-settlement of refugees. The State Department considered, however, that some form of United Nations cover would be unavoidable. The Committee might therefore wish to consider draft additions to paragraph 18 and a re-draft of the first sentence of paragraph 34 of the Memorandum which had been prepared and would now be handed to those present. x THE CHAIRMAN, referring to the general purpose of the Memorandum, said that the Middle East was an area of enormous importance to His Majesty*s Government. The present was a moment of stocktaking among the Arab States. The Palestine War had ended in the failure of their efforts and the coming months offered an opportunity which might never recur of helping them to get out of the rut of inertia and apathy in which they found themselves. The Arab States themselves were tending to turn to the United Kingdom for advice and help. We were not dealing with an area in which tidy economic plans could be carried out or European standards applied. It was a question of passing from conditioxis of comparative internal chaos to stability. The aim of the Memorandum was to put the problem of economic development into correct focus and to lay down general principles. If the Committee thought the Memorandum was on the right lines they might wish to endorse it for submission to the Official Committee on Economic Development. The next step thereafter might be to make a financial analysis of the necessary development schemes. The sums concerned might turn out to be not so later be thoug «- This ’ howcver ’ was a The Committee then considered certain general aspects of the Memorandum, including the maintenance of a due balance between the United Kingdom and U.S. contributions over the whole field and between the claims of different areas in which the United Kingdom was specially interested. In discussion the following points arose-- (a) It was agreed that we should, in any discussions with the U.S. Authorities, underline the substantial contribution towards the development of overseas territories which the United Kingdom was making, not only in the Middle East but in the Colonies, the Commonwealth, the Occupied Territories, the Far East and elsewhere. This should ensure that the problem was reviewed in the general context of world-wide development. * To be circulated, together with other amendments^and addenda proposed under the same Item, as M.E.(o)(49)9 (Revise).('b) At the same time it was felt that the Committee should not^ overlook the fact that the Colonies, although ^oS immediately threatened 'by Communist influences, had strong claims on us for assistance in development projects* These claims might conflict with schemes for the Middle East and # other areas not only in matters of finance 'but also on the prac ica plane of our ability to supply the necessary raw materials and technical personnel. Complementary studies Cnrnni tt £=. t0 ths . oth ® r ?£ ( sas would, however, be made by parallel Committees concerned witn overseas economic development, and c part from the contacts between those Committees which would necessarily ensue, it would be the duty of the Official Committee dLferent 1 a^a- el0PmSntl t0 co “ ordinate the final proposals for cshnni ss, ^ the Middle East (Official) Committee , n formulating its detailed recommendations take a stand P° int in judging the merits and f : asibHity oi ohe projects it might put forward. Apart from relative costs there would be various criteria to be applied and we should from the outset recognise that these projects fell into two classes (i) the long-term projects, e.g, Nile waters, Lto which His Majesty’s Government may not be called upon to contribute greatly; (ii) the small ''pilot” projects which are important because they are capable of early realisation. . :F ur ^ 18 f question of importance was the part to be played in Middle East development by the United Nations Organisations, iho view of the State Department had already been indicated a ove. 0 regards the altitude to be taken by the Committee m the Memorandum before them, the following points were made;— ( d ) _ 1 here \/ere three particular interests of the United Kingdom in which we would be opposed to United Nations intervention or rivalry;— (i) the Nile Waters; (ii) the Iraqi Flood Control and Irrigation Schemes; (iii) 'tbe work of the British Middle East Office, We would very much regret the assumption by the Economic and Social Council of any responsibility for (i) and (ii) and we would not want to see the B.M.E.O., supplanted bv the U.N. specialised agencies (e) On the other hand, the assistance of the International Bank and of the Food and Agriculture Organisation would be welcomed. As regards^the F.A.O. and probably certain other agencies, the possLoility of undesirable complications, e.g, active interest on the part of Soviet representatives for political reasons, seemed to be unlikely and even remote. The F,A,0. was organised on a regional basis and, provided proper liaison were maintained with the B.M.E.O,, it would be useful to encourage F.A#0. to give advice and technical assistance to under-developed countries in the Middle East. The new Director-General of F.A.O, had laid the foundations of better relations between the Regional Office in Cairo and the B.M.E.O. A' J r-4- (f) The specialised agencies were not executive holies* If, however, they received more money as a result of President Truman’s Fourth point, they would no doubt endeavour to exercise an influence on development in the Middle East, the Colonies and elsewhere and it might he embarrassing to ^ refuse their aid. The Committee was informed that the O.E.E.C. countries concerned had agreed that any extension of the work of the u.N, Agencies to the Colonial field was undesirable and they might, therefore, seek an outlet for their activities in the Middle East. There would no doubt also be claims for assistance from the Latin-American countries and possibly others. The United Kingdom and the U.S. did in fact have great influence with the specialised agencies, and we could no doubt use this influence if occasion demanded. (g) It was important that direct executive responsibility for development projects should be left in the hands of the Middle East Governments concerned. The provision of United Nations aid would depend on specific requests by the_Governments concerned, and it might be that Governments in the Middle East would not all be anxious to seek such aid. Though there \vas general hostility in the Middle East towards the U.N. political organisations the attitude towards the specialised agencies varied from country to country. Fgypt, for instance, supported the F.A.O., while others alleged that F.A.O. was dominated by Jewish influence. The World Health Organisation was generally popular and all the Middle East countries v/ere represented at* the U.N.E.S.C.O. Conference in Beirut. They would probably wish to get all they could from the Internetional Bank. (h) It was agreed in general that, while we wished to encourage the help of the U.N, Agencies in so far as that help would be effective in the Middle East, we should guard against those agencies assuming parental responsibility for development schemes e.g, the Nile Waters, We should seek to guide the efforts of the Agencies along the right lines and to take care that they should not, in any particular instance, be regarded by Middle East Governments as having supplanted the B.M.E.O. The Committee then proceeded to consider the Memorandum paragraph by paragraph. In the course of this examination the following points, apart from several drafting amendments were discussed:- (i) paragraph 5 ; The Committee considered whether the Working Party should be asked to submit a paper defining the reforms which it was suggested that Middle East Governments should put into effect. After some discussion it was agreed that a separate paper was not necessary at this stage, (j) paragraph 11 : It was agreed that a paragraph might be added at this pcirit, or perhaps elsewhere in the Memorandum if mors suitable, covering the necessity for balancing the requirements of the various competing areas, e.g. the Colonies, Far East etc.- 5 - t % (k) paragraph 33 : It was agreed that this paragraph should he re-drafted in part to include a reference to the F .0 • /h The Coinmittee;- (1) Invited the Colonial Office to send to the Secretariat a draft paragraph as agreed at (j) above. (2) invited the Ministry of Food to re-draft part of paragraph 33 i * 1 accordance with (k) above, and to send the draft to the Secretariat. (3) Agreed to reconsider M.E.(0)(49)9 with the revisions and additions discussed above at a further meeting on Thursday, 5th May, at 3 p.m* 4. PE-SETTLEMENT OF ARAB REFUGEES FROM PALESTINE The Committee had before them a Note by the Joint Secretaries on the re-settlement of ,,rab refugees from Palestine (M.E.(0)(49)10). ME. BURROWS said that since the Note had been circulated the proposed telegram to Washington had had to be re-drafted and as it was necessary to despatch it at an early date, he did not think the matter could await the next meeting of the Committee. He proposed, therefore, if the Committee agreed, to circulate the re-draft the same day, if possiole, to the Departments most interested and to report again on the matter at the next meeting. The Committee:- Invited the Foreign Office to clear the proposed telegram to Washington with the Departments most interested and to report again on the matter at the next meeting.

CONFIDENTIAL Addressed to Washington telegram No.Saving (date) repeated for information saving to U.K. Delegation^ New York, B.M.E.O., Jerusalem. IMPORTANT My telegram No. 4222^/of 13th April: Palestine Arab Refugees]? Please inform State Department that we are in general agreement with the proposed plan of action submitted by Mr. McGhee, subject to the following comments. 2. As we see it, our joint aim should be that the Conciliation Commission would appoint a high powered executive who would in due courao concern himself with the whole question of refugees and also with foreign assistance foj? development schemes which would help to absarfc refugees in those countries where it is hopefl to settle them. We should welcome the appoint^ ment‘ of an American businessman to this post and should be prepared ourselvee to find a deputy for him. Under the chief executive there might be two divisions, one of which should be set up with the minimum delay and be concerned with the development aspect. The other would in due course take over the relief work at present entrusted to U.N.R.P.R. and be concerned (directly or indirectly) with assisting refugees until they can be absorbed into remunerative occupations, /helping-2 helping them to find such temporary work as may be possible'in order to prevent their moral deterioration and helping them to finu more permanent jobs as such^become available# T.he preliminary census work would also fall under the jurisdiction of this division as soon as it was formed. We share Mr, McGhee’s view that a census is an essential basis for the whole operation of settling the refugees and ought to be under taken at the earliest possible date. We are sending our views on this point separately. 3 . As State Department will be aware, we are most anxious to establish a concerted Anglo- American approach to the whole problem, but we appreciate the reasons which lead the U.S. Government to insist upon the work being carried out under the aegis of the United Nations, viz, that otherwise it might prove impossible to get the necessary appropriations from Congress and that the U.S. Government feel bound to avoid giving the appearance of direct intervention in Middle East affairs. After further consideration we too think it would probably be impracticable to avoid entirely the use of the United Nations channel at least to the extent of using the conciliation commission if the operations of maintenance and resettlement are to be linked together, which seems to us to offer the best prospects of success# 4# At the same time we are considerably exercised lest the approach to the problem should, if dealt with through the United Nations, be removed from the practical sphere of technical /andand financial assistance and thrown into United Nations politics with all that that would imply in delay, inefficiency and Soviet intrigue. To the extent contemplated above we are prepared to accept this risk as the only apparent way of overcoming other obstacles, but we should like you to consider with the State Department and the U.K. Delegation at New York whether there is anything we can do to minimise it On the financial side, which may prove the most important in this respect, there appear to be three separate spheres in which funds will be required. These are (a) for the salaries and administrative expenses of the chief executive and his staff, (b)' for the census, maintenance, provision of temporary work and actual resettlement of the refugees, and (c) for the financing of development projects. We are not clear whether, on the assumption that the Gonciliation Commission will be willing and able to appoint the chief executive and his staff, it will have to apply for additional funds for administrative purposes from the United Nations. This may perhaps depend on the amount required. If so, H.M.G. and the U.S. Government may be able to assist by seconding a considerable part of the necessary staff from their own officers, thereby obviating the need for their salaries to be sanctioned and paid for by the United Nations. If, as may prove unavoidable in order to make the plan acceptable to the Arab Governments, it be found necessary to invite them also to appoint /members3 -4- members of the staff, they too might be willing to second such persons and pay their salaries* For our part we have on hand in the Britisn Middle Bast Office a group of experts who have already spent three years surveying and advising on development and social subjects in the countries in question, and we should be willing to make the services of these experts available as far as possible. The U.S. Government for their part might consider seconding the major part of the staff required for relief, etc. There seems therefore some prospect of arranging for the salaries of the chief executive and his senior staff to be met by the individual governments providing them. But of course there will be other administrative expenses, e.g. for transport, office^ etc., and funds may also be required to pay the salaries of such Palestinians as may be needed in subordinate jobs, e.g. for the census. We could not contemplate contributing directly ourselves more than the salaries of the experts and of the deputy chief executive. 6 * With regard to 5(b) above, the funds of U.N.R.P.R. will run out at latest by the end of the year, and the scale on which this aspect of the work will have to be continued will be larger than has obtained hitherto. The census will cost money,' and we entirely agree with Mr. McGhee that it will not be enough merely to keep the refugees .alive. They must, so far as possible, be found work even though this adds to the cost. Some form of employment bureau will /also-5- also be needed to place refugees in such employ ment as may become available. A further expense will be the cost of moving refugees from their present camps to places where tney can be put to work. In the light of what Mr.McGhee has told us of American thinking, we see no means of raising the necessary funds to assist for these purposes except from the United Nations, despite the fact that the only serious contributors to U.N.R.P.R. were H.M.G. and the U.S. Government. The only possible alternative that occurs to us is that if the Israeli Government prove ready to make a substantial contribution on behalf of the refugees, this might be paid direct to the Conciliation Commission without going through the United Nations machine. But we feel no great confidence in such procedure proving possible even if the Israeli Government are found willing to provide a sufficient sum for the purposes mentioned. 7 * Lastly, there are the funds required for financing development projects, without which such projects cannot be got started. Apart from the necessary administrative and staffing expenses (to which it is hoped that individual governments may contribute, see paragraph 5 above) United Nations will not be in a position to make any contribution in this respect. But it is much to be hoped that the International Bank will be able to finance sane at any rate of the development schemes. It may also prove possible in due course to attract private capital, e.g. from the oil companies. /Meanwhile*• ♦ - 6 - Meanwhile, we agree that everything possible should be done to interest the specialised agencies, such as the Pood and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, in providing technical assistance in all stages of the operation from relief to development, always provided that they are prepared to work within the general framework of the arrangements proposed, 8ir Herbert Broadley of the Pood and Agriculture Organisation, has telegraphed to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, offering to help as much as possible in connection with the resettlement of Arab refugees. He points out that projects now being considered for providing technical assistance to under-developed countries in accordance with President Truman f s Fourth Point will also materially contribute to a solution of this problem. But even when all these sources have been tapped, there is still likely to be left a large field which could only be covered by direct government grants. We have shown the way with the interest-free loan of £1,000,000 which has just been made to Transjordan for this purpose, 8, Even if the United Nations were, as we expect, to make no direct financial contri bution to the development schemes, we are not confident that such schemes could long be kept away from the United Nations if they are linked with this work of the Conciliation Commission, The Commission could hardly avoid /reporting-7- reporting to the Assembly on its proposed activities and might thus come under direct fire. Nevertheless, for the reasons already given, we are prepared to support Mr. McGhee*s view that the Conciliation Commission should take into consideration and where necessary assist development schemes as part of its general work for the resettlement of refugees# At the same time we wish to emphasise that in our view resettlement must be carried out within the framework of existing national development plans in the Middle East and that priority should be given to those plans. We want to avoid duplication and to profit from the work already done. 9* Please communicate foregoing to State Department and report what the results of their further consideration have been. I should also welcome the comments of the U.K. Delegation at New York.Record of a I.leeting; he l d at the Foreign Q ^ fioe on 13th Apri 1, 1 9^9 . PR^SRNT: Lr. ivi.R. Wright (i' ! oreign Office) in the Chair Mr. J.J. McCloy (President of the International Bank) Mr. G. McGhee (Adviser to the State Department on Arab Refugees) Mr. Lev/is Jones (United States Embassy) Sir ‘ftohn Troutbeck (Foreign Olfice) Mr. B. Boothby (Foreign Office) Mr. Norman Young (Treasury) Mr. S.A. Berthoud (Foreign Office) Mr. J. Beith (Foreign Office) Mr. A.G. Maitland (Foreign Office) Miss C. Waterloo (Foreign Office). 1, Mr. Wright began by pointing out the great- importance which His Majesty's Government attached to the social and economic development of the Middle East. We considered it essential that development should be accelerated if the area was not to follow the Par East in falling under Communist control. The refugee problem enhanced the urgency of development, since in our view resettlement should be carried out within the framework or national development plans. Transjordan, Iraq and Syria appeared to be the only.Middle East countries where resettlement was a practical possibility. Mr. McGhee pointed out that in the case of Iraq and Syria, resettlement was at present politically unacceptable and only by offering assistance, financial or otherwise, for these plans, and making such assistance conditional upon resettlement of a certain number of refugees, was their acceptance likely to be secured. Mr, Wright stated that in our view it would be undesirable for the United Nations to play any major part in the implementation of these development plans. First, their record of efficiency did not stand high. Secondly, we wanted to keep Russia and the Satellites out of the area. Thirdly, in whatever form financial help was given, the major contribution would have to come from the United Kingdom and the United States. Mr. McGhee stated that the State Department were in general agreoment with this point of view. On the other hand the United States Government', unlike His Majesty’s Government, had no traditional interest in the area which might justify the assumption of direct financial responsibilities. If therefore a direct grant of funds from - Congress had to be sought, as it almost certainly would have to be, it would be essential in order to justify this grant to Congress that there should be some framework of United Nations Control. 3• Continuation of R elief '• Mr. McGhee pointed out that resettlement must inevitably be a sTow process, taking place perhaps over a period of five or more years. During this period some sort of relief organisationorganisation would have to 'be maintained* He considered,, however, that as soon as possible the emphasis should he shifted from Relief to Employment even though this might involve financing unproductive public works and cost twice as much as pure relief. Short-term employment could probably be found for a certain number of the refugees_ e.g* on constructing the development works, with the oil companies, etc. U# Finance During discussion it was pointed out that all three countries would require funds from outside sources to finance their development plans (possibly in the form of local as well as of foreign currency) and that sources from which such funds ar^-or might be forthcoming were: (a) The Specialised Agencies, e.g. World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization#. Mr. McCloy stated that these Agencies might ultimately find themselves with anything up to # 30 , 000,000 of which the largest share would be provided by the United States Goyi^wment, for technical assistance to undeveloped areas Tor the implementation of President Truman’s fourth point. (it would however be unwise to regard this as a source of capital assistance or to assume that technical assistance could all be directed to the Middle East.) (^) Mr, Wright stated that His Majesty’s Government had agreed to make an interest free loan of £1,000,000 to Transjordan for short-term development projects, including projects to resettle UO - 60,000 refugees. Mr. Norman Young pointed out in reply to Mr. McCloy_ that on account of the British balance of payments position it would be extremely difficult for us to make further loans to the Middle East involving the provision of capital equipment goods on credit. The Treasury was, moreover, opposed in principle to lending for conversion into local currency since it was considered that this must inevitably result in inflation. In the case of Iraq there could be no question of a British loan while large sterling balances still existed. (c) The International Bank, which was now considering a substantial loan to finance water storage and irrigation development in Iraq. Mr. McCloy pointed out, however, that in accordance with its Charter, the Bank coaid not make loans without reasonable prospects of repayment. Such prospects did not at present exist in Transjordan or Syria (Transjordan is not a member of the Bank and Syria, though a member, has not yet applied for a loan). In order to overcome this difficulty he had thought of getting together a Consortium consisting possibily of His Majesty's Government the United States6 Status Government and the French Government, who would jointly guarantee the Bank’s loans to Middle East States to • whom commercial lending was impracticable; (d) The Import-Export Bank, which in certain circumstances ^ is prepared itself to undertake projects in undeveloped areas. The considerations which govern the loan policy of the International Bank apply, however, equally to the Import-Export Bank; * . (e) Sir John Troutbeck suggested that it might be possible to work out some scheme whereby the immense oil royalties which would shortly be accruing to the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms, where very little scope for development exists, could be utilised for regional development. 5. Expert advice on P.elief and Resettlement Mr. McGhee then outlined his conception of the sort of long-term United Nations Belief and Resettlement Organization which would be required. He suggested that its functions should be: (i) to investigate the resettlement possibilities within the framework of existing development plans and to coordinate the assistance, both financial and technical, which can be given to these plans by the United Nations Specialised Agencies, the International Bank, the Import-Export Bank, the British and United Stat s Government and any other sources; (ii) to administer the relief programme and find short term work for refugees who could not be immediately resettled (this programme was much more likely to secure acceptance by the United Nations and the United States and other governments if it formed part of a practical resettlement programme); (iii) to assist the refugees in the actual process of resettlement. There should be a small team of experts who should on no account duplicate survey work already carried out. He considered that this team could most appropriately be attached to the Conciliation Commission. It could be set up without reference to the General Assembly who would probably be unwilling to establish a new Agency, but might be prepared to accept an accomplished fact. Its Head should be a leading United States business man and its deputy Head should be British. (A written statement of Mr. McGhee’s proposals is attached as (3)). Mr. Wright welcomed hr. McGhee’s proposals. He said that they would nowbe urgently studied in the Foreign Office, and then submitted to the Secretary of State on his return to this country. As soon as the .Secretary of State’s views were known, we would communicate at once with the State .Department.6. Census expert fop* McGhee suggested that it would he desirable to arrange immediately ior a British or American census expert to he attached to the Conciliation Commission to undertake a^ detailed census of the refugees, Mr, Wright stated that the Foreign Office would make immediate enquiries whether such an expert could he made available.r N OTE ON A PR ELIM IN ARY NESTING WITH MR. M oGHSE AN D MR. LEWIS J ONES. Mr. McGheo ‘began by saying that resettlement must be part of development schemes generally. There should bo no direct resettlement schemes. The general aim should be to raise the economic potential of each country as a means of absorbing the refugees. The approach should be that such outside help as was being extended was for the purpose of restoring the dislocated economies of tho countries concerned. Under whatever facade might be appropriate, tho necessary help would have to be provided by the United States and the United Kingdom. The United States Government would not wish to approach the problem unilaterally or to incur any direct responsibilities, but it nevertheless wished to do its share. Some way must be found of using the facade of tho United Nations if Congress were to be enabled to appropriate the necessary funds. Mr. McGhee then referred to th.e financial aspects of development schemes. There were certain fields, o.g. the larger development schemes, which were appropriate for financing by the World Bank, the United states Export-Import Bank, etc. Tho World Bank were now looking at some of these schemes and Mr. McGhee remarked that they wore not unfavourable towards tho Iraqi schemes. But tho larger schemes would take time and .meanwhile any sort of works projects schemes (roads, houses, etc.) by which some of the refugees could earn a living would be better than a dole, which the United states and United Kingdom Governments would have to shoulder in any case. What he called grant funds might bo more costly but they were certainly better than a straight relief. Mr. McGhee thought that one of tho Conciliation Commission s first steps should bo to set up a Survey Group (of probably 15 or 20 persons) one of whose first tasks should be to take a census. This could be done quietly to avoid giving the Arab Governments the impression that the Commission had accepted that there would be no repatriation of refugees. The Survey Group would attest to determine the wishes of the refugees in the light of the latest information about conditions in their.homo districts in Palestine. Mr. McGhee thought that considerable numbers of refugees would in fact wish to return to their homes. The Survey Group would then examine all possible schemes )f development which would assist in the resettlement of refugees. &gt;hey would formulate plans, agree on a programme and recommend aethods of financing the schemes. At about this stage it would be 3 est for the Conciliation Commission (which would be labouring mder the handicap of being connected in Arab minds with political 'ather than development questions) to bo replaced by a Development ioar^operating direct ly under the United Hat ions General Assembly, ’he Boa?d would be primarily an Anglo-United States body. ■&gt;rvr»hflr&gt;s it could be headed by an American businessman, with a British Deputy, on tho United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees node! It could be given an international flavour by tho irroointment of, say, a Frenchman as an irrigation expert. The Soardwould appelfto tho various countries likely to contribute /forfor fiinds to financo dovolopment schomos (in fact this would mean the United States and the United Kingdom) and to the International Bank. Mr. McGhee thought that, if there were any certainty Ox funds being forthcoming, Mr. Griffis would ho prepared to alter his U.N.R.P.R. operations from a 'feeding basis' to a 'work basis'. The relief phase would be brought to an end; refugees would be paid wages for work under any soft of interim schemes that could be devised, and no-one would get anything ho did not z earn. Congress could be more easily persuaded to vote more fun'ds for some such programme than for the continuance of relief operations. The first step was to nominate the. staff for the census-taking under the Conciliation Commission. No formalities would have to be gone through since the Conciliation Conmission had a very wide mandate. Mr. McGhee thought that the salaries of the additional staff could be paid from the Cotnnissio^i% funds. The Survey Group would then be set up. It should probably have its headquarters at Beirut, whatever the future base of the Conciliation Commission itself. The survey Group might in due course evolve an Employment Agency from which Aramco, the Kuwait Oil Company, etc., might eventually obtain labour. The Fourth Point was a programme of technical assistance only. But the resettlement of refugees would obviously be assisted by the provision of experts under the Fourth Point scheme. The Fourth Point also envisaged the underwriting of private investment (on the lines of the original SCA plan), and this might also help resettlement. The oil companies and the Near East Foundation, the Quakers and other bodies could also lend a hand.CONFIDENT IAL PA LESTINE REFUGEE PROBLEM PROP OS ED PLAN FOR ACTI ON I« Initiate immediately concerted program to overcome the present political stalemate preventing the Arab States and Israel from facing the refugee problem realistically and conh struotively# Full use should ho made of direct diplomatic approach, official statements, publicity, etc*, particularly as a background for forthcoming extended talks in Switzerland. II. In the meantime encourage all now public and private programs and projects, such as the United Kingdom pilot project in TJ and the International Bank project in Iraq., which can bo initiated within the present context and which will servo $o alleviate the refugee problem. Ill# Recommend to the PGC that it establish permanent head quarters and add to its staff such administrative personnel and experts as are required for carrying out its planning and operational responsibilities as they arise. There appears to bo an immediate need for expert or experts on statistical aspects of the refugee problem. Services to facilitate re patriation, employment and emigration of refugees, and to represent them vis—h-vis Israel and all other governments, should be initiated as soon as possible. IV. Initiate immediately planning required for the establish ment of a technical group to be set up under the authority of the PCG as soon as political conditions permit which would be the subject of recommendation to the PGC. This group would examine the situation in the countries concerned in the light of existing surveys in full co-operation with these states and preferably at their request. It would co-ordinate fully views and interests of all UN members, international and private organisations concerned, and would recommend measures required to; (a) Overcome economic dislocations created by the recent hostilities; (b) reintegrate refugees from the hostilities into the economy of the area; (c) foster actively such economic and development projects as are required to achieve the foregoing and which will, at the same time, serve to increase the economic potential of the countries concerned. V. The technical group would recommend specific projects, as well as an integrated program and moans of carrying it out. Upon application by the countries concerned, some of the re commended projects may be acceptable for financing by the Inter national Bank, others by loans from the United States, United Kingdom or other United Nations members. For refugees not taken care of by these projects, programs of work relief would be initiated as soon as practicable to succeed the present UNRPR relief programs. Work projects not qualifying for international loans would be financed either through a new UN program, or through direct grants from the United States, United Kingdom or other /United Nations~l I Uni tod Nations 01011113 ors for this purpose. VI• At an appropriate stage in the work of the technical group, tho PCG•would establish a moro permanent agency to carry out this program as it was approved. Such agency would roly wherever possible on direct action of states concerned, other United Nations members*, international and private organisations. It would co-ordinate such act ivities, facilitate the furnishing of technical and financial assistance required, and exercise supervisory functions.Hr taurtvj ! ^ * A I s A J r\*A Present: ' P&amp; S RECORD OF A MEETING WITH MR. J.J. MCG^PYj iN ^ ^ PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK / , r April 25th. 1 9U9 ^?;* / Mr. M.R. Wright (in the Chair) Mr. J.J. McCloy Sir John Troutheck (B.M.E.O.) Mr. W.P. Crawford (B.M.E.O.) Mr. B.A.B. Burrows Mr. W.A.B. Iliff (International Bank) - for part of the discusaon Mr. G. Lewis Jones (U.S. Embassy) Mr. A.G. Maitland J In opening the discussion, which he hoped would be regarded as completely informal and without commitment either on the part of Mr. McCloy or the representatives of the U.S. and U.K. Governments, MR. WRIGHT, said that there were 3 cardinal points In H.M.G. f s attitude to Middle East development: (a) We attached the greatest importance to preventing the Middle East from following the example of China and coming under Communist domination; (b) After centuries of Turkish misrule, the Arab States had emerged into independent statehood and were trying to stand on their own feet. It was important to their future development that they should have both the pride and the responsibility of doing things for themselves. It was extremely undesirable from the point of view of the future of the Middle East countries that the whole task of their development should be undertaken for them by someone from the outside; (c) Nevertheless, the fact remained that the bulk of such outside assistance as these countries would inevitably require (money, technical assistance, etc.) would have to come from the U.K. and the U.S., whether direct or at one remove (e.g* through the machinery of the U.N.) The U.N. should not have any major responsibility. It could not be denied that the U.N. had not turned out to be the kind of mechanism we had hoped for. Above all, it was essential to avoid^giving Russia the opportunity through the United Nations of gaining a foothold in the Middle East. We recognised, however, that the U.S. might not be able to intervene directly in the Middle East economic development, and that a U.N. facade to cover U.S. intervention might therefore be unavoidable* MR. MC CLOY said he believed the U.S. Government was ■^Ql^ing a great interest in Middle East development. Speaking for the Bank he could say that the importance of promoting development in the Middle East was recognised. It was highly important, however, to develop technical services locally. Technical knowledge in the Middle East was scanty and considerable development in that field was of prime importance. He thought there was considerable scope for the U.N. agencies but coordination of their various activities was essential. MR. WRIGHT agreed that such specialised agencies as the World Health Organisation and the Pood and Agriculture Organisation could play an important role. But we were anxious to avoid U.N. intervention in such projects as the Iraq Irrigation Schemes and the Nile Waters. The initiative / in/MR. CRAWFORD - 2 ~ in these schemes should come from the Governments concerned# We envisaged, for the Nile Waters schemes, the setting up of a Technical .Committee consisting of experts representing the interested Governments, who would call in outside aic^aB and when necessary* We would want to avoid any suggestion of an International Development Corporation# MR* MCCLOY thought that something in the nature of an International Corporation would be needed in order to bring out the finance requiredo MR* WRIGHT explained that, for the Owen Palls Dam, a division of costs had been agreed between Egypt and the Uganda Government, and that should Egypt require assistance in finding the external finance for this or any other part of the comprehensive schemes for which she is responsible — it would be for her to seek outside assistance on her own account# MR. CRAWFORD said that this was the case too in connexion with the Qeneh Project# Egypt was seeking a loan herself, and would carry out the scheme on her own# SIR JOHN TROUTBECK and MR. JONES then referred to the problem of refugee resettlement,, the ^joint Anglo—U.S* approach to which was by regarding it as part and parcel of the general problem of the economic development of the Middle East# Our agreed aim was to effect the resettlement of refugees by direct or indirect absorption in schemes designed to raise the economic potential of the countries concerned# MR. CRWFORD referred to his recent visit to Iraq, Syria and The Lebanon. There had been a marked change in the attitude of the Middle East Governments towards economic and social development since President Truman T s inaugural address and the Secretary of^State f s subsequent speech in Parliament* The Palestine detente and the visits of officials of the International Bank had also contributed to the change in attitude and people were now expecting . something to happen. It was extremely important to seize the opportunity, therefore, of putting one or two specific schemes into effect. He mentioned particularly the Qeneh Scheme in Egypt, and the Tigris Flood Control Projects. Flood control was the basis of any expansion of agricultural development in Iraq, and the publicity attending the execution of these and any other particular projects would have an enormous effect. The economy of Syria could be considerably strengthened and enriched by the development of the Jezira and the Khabur and Orontes Valley, and each of these schemes would incidentally help greatly towards resettling Palestine refugees. The first essential was to make a start with small schemes as a means of arousing and maintaining interest in development# MR* MCCLOY remarked that Iraq had made an approach to the Bank be?ore the Palestine war# She had then broken off the discussions and had attacked the Government in the United Nations# It could not be said that the Bank had lacked interest in the Middle East.MR, CRAWFORD said he had gained the impression that the Bank had not been interested in flood control schemes in Iraq until Mr, Bayne and Mro Engert had seen the Tigris in flood# MR, MCCLOY explained that the obstacle had been Iraq’s inability to raise the necessary internal finance# The Bank had met this difficulty in the Middle East and in Latin America# It was very important to build up the local investment process# MR. CRaWFORD said that we had been trying to persuade the Iraqis to effect financial and fiscal reforms and to set up a Central Development Boards But it might take a long time for Iraq to set her house in order# She was in a peculiarly difficult position, with the Kurds in the North and the even tougher Euphrates tribes in the South# If we were to set too high a standard for Iraq’s financial and fiscal reforms, her development schemes would be a long way off# MR, ILIFF joined the meeting at this point. SIR JOHN TROUTB ECK supported Mr# Crawford’s argument. He said that Iraq's special difficulties and misfortunes must be taken into account. Apart from the difficulties of the Palestine war she had suffered one or two bad harvests and at least one disastrous flood# Flood damage was estimated at £ 1 million a year on the average# Iraq had until recently managed to balance her budget in fact, and this year again, on paper if not in fact© MR# ILIFFe said that the Bank would not of course insist that Iraq should attain European standards in her finance and administration. He enquired about the proposed financing of the three projects on which the International Bank Mission had made recommendations# V The three projects were then discussed in some detail (Wadi Tharthur - Stage I, Habbaniyah - Stage I -.Gibraltar Dam on the Diyala) # MR, MCCLOY wondered what prospects Iraq had of raising local labour~costs locally 0 MR. BURROV/S said that this depended largely on the future of the oil royalty situation# Oil royalties had in the past been set aside in part to finance development, and Iraq’s ability to find the necessary local finance would turn on the solution of the Haifa Refinery problem# SIR JOHN TR OUTBECK added that a reform of the tax-collecting machinery was also important© MR. CRAWFO R D said that it had been estimated that by 195U Iraq would be receiving'about £10 million in oil royalties annually on future pipe-line capacity# There had moreover been a rich strike in the south near Basra* In ansv/er to MR# MCCL O Y ’s enquiry MR. WRIGHT said that progress towards the reopening of the Haifa Refinery depended on a settlement between Israel on the one hand and Egypt and Transjordan on the other# The remaining Arab States were hanging back and preferred to let Egypt and Transjordan make \/ MR. CRAWFORD -4- the running in reaching a settlements MR. MCCLOY thought that the greatest difficulty facing the Bank was the problem of meeting local costs. The required an earnest that the Government concerned was on‘the right track. In Latin America the Bank had financed only external expenditure. There had, however, been an experimental arrangement in Chile whereby a loan was granted for the purchase of mechanised equipment. The Chilean Government sold the equipment to local cultivators and the proceeds had been employed to pay the local costs of the construction of a dam, the external financing of which had been met by the Bank. MR. CilAWFOKD thought that the case of Iraq should be looked at from the point of view of her considerable future earnings from oil royalties. Something must meanwhile be done to overcome the local financing difficulty. It was important that a start should be made soon. MR. MCCLOY and MR-&gt; ILIFF discussed the Bank f s attitude to the financing of internal expenditure. MR. ILIFF said that the Bank was not in fact precluded from assisting with internal expenditure, but it was unsound to do so until all available channels of local finance had been thoroughly explored. If the Bank lent dollars for local financing, the borrowing country would have to repay in dollars. That was a wrong burden for the country to have to carry. In the case of Iraq, I.D. 7 million would be required for the local financing of the three projects discussed earlier and if Iraq sought the Ban^s aid for the whole amount and it were granted, she would need to repay all this amount in dollars plus the dollar loan granted for external expenditure. SIR J. TROUTBECK agreed that Iraq could make a better effort to find the local financing. MR. MCCLOY said that it was important for Iraq to start balancing and borrowing locally straight away. The only thing lacking in the three schemes which had been examined was Iraq f s ability to raise local currency needs. MR. ILIFF explained that the Bank could make up its mind quite quickly on the Haigh Irrigation Scheme proposals if the Bank r s engineers could first go through the Commission^ Report. It was agreed that a copy should be sent to Mr. Iliff as soon as possible. MR. CRAY/FORD asked if the Bank Mission now in Egypt (Mr. Stephens and Mr. Bochenski) could not now go on to Iraq, rather than that a separate mission should be sent out in June or July to Bagdad. MR. MCCLOY and MR. ILIFF thought it would be better to send a separate team to Iraq. They agreed that once their engineers had gone over the Haigh Report, a team could aim at setting out to Iraq by June. MR. WRIGHT withdrew from the meeting and Mr. Burrows took the chair. The meeting then proceeded to discuss particular projects in the various countries other than Iraq.-5- MR. CR/i^FORD explained to MRe ILIFF the position regarding the Qeneh Project in Egypt and the Nile Waters® MR&gt; BURROWS said that ? in Transjordan (which is not yet a member of the Ba nk), had recently granted an interest-free loan of £1 million for 3 small projects. The Jordan-Yarmuk scheme was then discussed and it was agreed that the foreign Office should attempt to obtain a breakdown of the cost as between internal and external expenditure® MR. MCOLOY asked what chance Transjordan would have of servicing a sterling loan if one were granted. It was suggested that the scheme would enable the production of^ special crops which could be placed on the market (e.g. in Israel) much earlier than similar crops from &lt;3bewhere in the region, bringing much higher prices as a result. The other main argument in favour of the schemewas, of course, refugee resettlement. MR. MCCLOY withdrew from the meetinp; at this point MR. ILIFF then went on to explain the Bank f s loan arrangements« The Bank made no tied loans. It had to seek the permission of the country whose currency was involved before a loan could be made in that currency. Sometimes, if a particular currency other than dollars (e.g. Belgian francs) were desired and if permission were not forthcoming, the , Bank bought the currency in dollars from the Central Bank of the country concerned. But the borrowing country had then to repay the loan in dollars® The Bank was attracted by practical projects which were either dollar-earners or dollar-savers, and which made some genuine contribution to the economy of the borrowing country. Where there was no direct contribution to the balance of payments position the criterion must be the ability of the economy of the country concerned to meet the servicing of the dollar loan. He admitted that it was not easy to find any schemes in the Middle ^ast at present which satisfied the Bank’s criteria. MR. JONES asked if the Bank favoured the formation of local consortiums of businessmen and investors for financing the local currency expenditure. MR. ILIFF said that the Bank thought a great deal more could be done by local private enterprise in under-developed countries® The International Bank would even be prepared in certain circumstances to make a dollar loan to such private groups, against the guarantee of the local Government, for the financing of the external expenditure on development projects. He referred to a^recent proposal for assisting in this way a local Asocia'cion de Fomento in Chile® Referring to Iraq, MR. ILIFF said that the Bank had not as yet received any formal application for a loan. The Bank did not stand on ceremony but it must know whether Iraq was /in- 6 - in fact interested in seeking a loan* He agreed to 1 let us know, after studying the papers in Washington, what the next move should be© ^ MR, CRAWFORD said that meanwhile His Majesty r _s Embassy at Bagdad thought it was essential for the Haigh^Commission toremain on in Iraq until the Bank's technical mission arrived. It was agreed that steps should be taken to persuade the Iraqi Government to arrange this. MR. ILIFF then referred to the Overseas Consultants' activities in Persia c He admitted that the Bank had been somewhat apprehensive about the Group's method of approach. The political situation was tricky, and Moscow Radio had already broadcast an attack on this recent alleged manifestation of U.S. economic imperialism through the instrument of the International Banko He thought it was essential that the O.C.I. should not give their blessing to any scheme which did not stand a good chance of success. He was doubtful whether the O.C.I. hal really tested Persia's financial ability to undertake the Seven-Year Plan but he was glad to say that Mr. Lotz had recently agreed to engage a competent financial expert to examine Persia's assessable capacity to finance the Plan. MR. ILIFF said he had heard that the Majlis had_ rejected Ebetehaj's Bill for the reduction of the note cover, and Ebetehaj's estimate of the period during which the Plan could do without external aid was being steadily reduced. As regards the Lebanon, MR. ILIFF said he had recently had a talk 'with M. Busson. An interesting point was that^ in the Lebanon exporters retain all but 10^ of their foreign exchange earningSo The same arrangement applied to remittances from abroad. Anyone could buy foreign currencies in the free market at free market rateso Thus, the Lebanon s imports are not borne on the Lebanon's official foreign exchange reserves, with the exception of bread grains. The Lebanon was still contemplating certain small irrigation schemes (in the Akkar Plain and the Beqaa.) On the whole, MR. ILIFF thought that the Bank's attitude to the Lebanon might be slightly less bearish than hitherto. MR. MCCLOY who rejoined the meeting at this point^ summed up h|s attitude by saying that the Bank was anxious to help. There must, however, be some substance to the projects for which the Bank s'aid was sought, and some sign of good management. If there were something tangible and definite the Bank could help. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.Io 25th Apr i l. 1949 ,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST Suggested addition to paragraph 18 and redrafts of second sentence of paragraph 51, first sentence of ' paragraph 34 and Recommendation’( e) Addition to paragraph 18 Latterly the State Department have begun to take a renewed interest in the subject, partly perhaps as a means of restoring American prestige in the Arab world from the depths to which it had fallen as a result of U.S. policy in Palestine, The State Department take the Arab refugee problem as their point of departure, believing that only through development schemes will it prove possible to make any solid progress over solving the refugee question, and at the same time believing that a contribution to the resettlement of the refugees v/ill be the form of financial assistance to the Middle East most likely to appeal to Congress, We have already had informal conversations with State Department officials on the subject and are inclined to accept their general approach to the problem, while making necessary reservations to limit United Nations inter ference in Middle East development. Redraft of second sentence of paragraph 51 It must of course be borne in mind that the sources of such assistance are limited and have other calls upon them, while the difficulties of H. M. G. at the present moment in this respect need no emphasis. Nevertheless, the immediate needs are relatively small and, given stable conditions, it should not be beyond the capacity of many of the Middle East countries to meet the interest on such loans as are likely to be required in the next year or so. Redraft/Redraft of first sentence of paragraph 54 . As stated in paragraph 18 informal conversations have already taken place with the State Department on Middle East development and Arab refugees, and it would be desirable to continue them. Redraft of Recommendation (e) We should continue the conversations which have started with the U.S. Government and endeavour to enlist their material support in promoting both development projects and the resettlement of the Arab refugees. At the same time we should endeavour to ensure ft-* ' that direct United Nations interference in Middle East development is kept to the minimum. *() c tt £yr&lt;- \ ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST For the purposes of this Paper, the Middle'East is considered to comprise Persia and the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant States, Iraq, Transjordan the Nile Basin from Egypt to Ethiopia, and the /'“'N former Italian Colonies* The problem of economic and social development in the Middle East is at once an opportunity, a responsibility and a challenge. 2* Danger of Communism Communist influence has recently been extended over a large part of China. There is a grave risk of its further extension into South East Asia. If the Middle East were also to fall under Communist control the cause of the democratic countries would suffer a cripp ling blow. The economic recovery of the United Kingdom and Western Europe would be gravely affected. The way would be opened for the spread of Communism into the rest of Africa. The position of Turkey, Greece and Italy would be largely undermined. The ability of Russia to wage successful war against the West would be greatly increased. The defence of the United Kingdom in the event of war would be compromised. 3. But we must face the fact that many of •fine conditions which favoured the extension of Communism in China exist in the Middle East. H.M. Government were largely responsible for the emergence of most of the Middle East count ries as independent and self-governing peoples. /But-2- /6. But the transition from centuries of Turkish misrule to self-government under modern ^ world conditions is a difficult one# Corruption, inefficiency and poverty are still endemic. The standard of living of the mass of the people is appallingly low, and the contrast with the wealth of the small and selfish ruling classes is glaring. In spite of the contradiction be tween the principles of the Moslem religion and of Communism, there are almost classic opportunities for Communist agitation by the exploitation of hardship, chaos and discontent. The failure of their efforts in Palestine has left the Arab countries in a state of demoralisation offering a field for dictatorial adventurers. 4. To prevent the Middle East falling behind the Iron Curtain must be a major objective of our policy and therefore merits a high priority in effort and contribution. Positive Opportunities The Communist danger cannot be met by a negative or passive approach, but by grasping the positive opportunities which exist. Middle E ast Governments alive to the need for measures to stern and turn back the advance of Communism.. But negative measures of mere repression are not enough; nor are the drafting and passing into law of paper plans for economic developnent and social improvement. Our aim must be to encourage Governments to take positive steps to put the needed reforms into effect and to remove the conditions in which Communism flourishes.6#' Large areas of the Middle East were in the past prosperous and fertile. By means of progressive policies carried out under vigorous leadership they could become so again. Major opportunities exist for irrigation, flood control and for increased food production in Egypt, the Sudan, Syria and Iraq* which in addition to augment Ing local consumption may in due course provide export surpluses for other areas. The continued and expanded exploitation of oil resources ought in the coming years to afford great wealth to Persia, Saudi Arabia, the Arab Sheikhdoms and Iraq. These developments will result in an increased demand for capital equipment from outside sources. The raising of the general standard of living will also in time increase the importance of the Middle East as a market for consumer goods* 7. The United Kingdom has a very considerable financial stake in the Middle East. For example, it is estimated that the replacement value of the fixed assets (e.g. refineries, pumps, pipe-lines, docks, transport, housing, hospitals, dispensaries, etc.) of British oil companies in the Middle East amounts to some £250 million. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company represents our greatest and most important single overseas investment. Our sales of Middle East oil to American Companies and to hard currency markets -in Europe and elsewhere are a vital element in our overall balance of payments* 8* The contribution which it is hoped Middle East oil will make to the recovery of the United Kingdom and Europe is illustrated by the following figures:-4- Flow of oil to Western Eurooe in million tons) Source 1218 12 . 4 § 195.1 (estimated) Middle East ' 9.4 (23.%) 18 (38$) (( co co U.S.A. 12 (29.6$) , 5 * 3 V (11.4$) 2.1 (3.6$) Rest of W. Hemisphere , 19 (47.1$) 8.5 (14.3$) 9» -ihe Middle East is the source of supply of certain essential commodities apart from ! oil. For example ? Egypt and the Sudan are the only source of the particular types of long- staple cotton required for the production of the high-grade textiles on which Lancashire f s future depends. It is probable that in the course of the next season we will be spending as much as £30 million It present prices'on Egyptian cotton and about £10-£12 million on cotton from the Sudan. The Sudan, too, supplies about SOf a of the world's requirements of gum arabic. The possibilities of expanding Middle East production of meat, oilseeds, fish and.cgreals are considerable. The area as a whole could become one of the more important sources of the supply of hides and skins. 10. The Middle E ae t joins three continents and two oceans. Its fifty million or so inhabitants straddle the only possible communication routes between Europe, Asia, Africa and the Par East. The area has proved as vital for air and radio communication as for camel-caravans and steamships. 11. Machine rz.for dealing with Middle East Policy In September 1945 the Foreign Secretary called a Conference of Britishrepresentatives in the Middle East, to survey the whole field I /of-5- of our policy in she area and to make recom mendations on future lines of action. The recommendations which he then submitted to the Cabinet (C-.P, (45) 1 74 of September 1 ?th, 1945)* and whichreceived their approval, called amongst other things for the following:- (a) the establishment of the British Middle East Office in Cairo, one of whose responsibilities would be to develop and ensure the co-ordination of British fin uncial,, economic and social policy and the Middle East region. (b) the setting up of machinery for the co-ordination of Middle East policy in London o 12* At the same time it was agreed (c) that economic development and social betterment must go forward hand in hand; (d) that Majesty's Government should encourage Middle East Governments to draw up their own plans for economic development and should offer to place at their disposal technical and specialist assistance to help them in formulating their schemes; (e) that we should steer local develop ment plans along lines in conformity with the limitations imposed on ourselves by our own financial and supply situation and with the needs of the region as a wholeo 13* As a result of the first recommendation! /the-6- the British Middle Office was duly established, with a Development Division to which were appointed advisers in agriculture, forestry and soil con servation, animal husbandry, health, labour, ^ statistics and entomology, A description of their activities in given in paragraph 22. The services of the Middle East representatives of the Treasury, Ministry of Fuel and Power and Ministry of Civil Aviation are also available to the Head of the British Middle East Office. 14* The second recommendation led to the setting up of a Ministerial Committee under the chairmanship of the Foreign Secretary and a Middle East (Official) Committee under the chairmanship of the Minister of State. In fact, the Middle East Committee uf Ministers has never met, while the Middle East (Official) Committee has met on only eight occasions. The inactivity of these Committees has been mainly due to the fact that the preoccupation of Middle East countries with Palestine has made it impossible to achieve much progress with schemes of development. For the same reason, plans which were discussed in 1947 in Wash ington for Anglo-American economic cooperation in the Miedle ^ast (see paragraph 15) have not yet been fully implemented. 15* There is now however some reason to hope that a settlement in Palestine may soon be reached. Moreover, the attitude to us of most of the Middle East countries has taken a turn lor the better and there is reason to hope /that,T (m that, in view of the possibilities opened up by President Truman's Fourth Point, Middle Bast Governments may be prepared to pay more attention to economic development and social reform# The whole problem has taken on a new urgency as a result of the emergence of Israel and the expulsion from their homes of over 800,000 Palestinian Arabs, while the economic futufe of G reater Transjordan and the financial stability of Iraq are matters of increasingly grave concerno 16 . The time is now ripe therefore for taking stock of the situation, for reviewing our machinery both at home and in the field, and for considering how further progress can best be achieved© 17. As a first step, the Middle East (Official) Committee has been reconstituted, under the chair manship of an Assistant Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office 0 (See C.P.(49)83 of April 11th, 1949)* The Middle East (Official) Committee has in turn set up a V/orking Party, under Foreign Office chairmanship, consisting of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Board of Trade and the Central Economic Planning Staff, together withrepresentatives of other Departments concerned with particular subjects under discussion. The terms of reference of the Working Party are set out in Annex A© 1 8 « Attitude of the U.S. Government The United States Government has reached parallel arid similar conclusions about the import ance of economic and social development in the /Middle-8- Middle Easto Annex B to this Paper contains the agreed results of discussions between the United States and H.M.

The initial phase of Survey has now been virtually completed, and the time has come when we should pass into the phases of Planning and Implementation, which to some extent overlap. 21• Phase I - Survey. A brief resume may be useful of what has been accomplished over the past few years in respect of economic and social development in the Middle Easto 22* To start with, certain economic fields were surveyed by the Middle East Supply Centre to form the subject of a number of basic reports. Since the establishment of the British Middle East Office in 1945 .the members of its Development Division have toured the area and submitted reports to the Governments concerned, with recommendations covering their various fields. These fields include general agriculture, forestry and soil conservation, animal husbandry, health, labour and industrial conditions, locust control and statistical organ isation. The oil companies have been at work prospecting and developing the oil resources of the area, and building up welfare services on a scale unprecedented in the Middle East. /Country-9- Country-wide surveys have been made by the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners . ^ in Syria and the Lebanon. In Persia particular aspects of development have been surveyed by Sir Ale* ander Gibb &amp; Partners and the American lirm of Morrison-Knudsen, and a general survey is now being undertaken by the American consortium. Overseas Consultants, Inc., in co-operation with Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners. Detailed surveys have been made by British consultants of flfOd * control and irrigation in Iraq, where plans have also been formulated in such fields as railway and road development, construction of bridges, etc. Surveys of Transjordan «are undertaken by the former Mandatory Government and this work has been continued by the British Development Officer, who has also carried out land settlement. In' the field of social welfare and administration a number of special reports have been made, e.g. a British expert has advised on co-operative development in Iraq and British and I.L.O. experts on co-operative development in Persia; in the Lebanon a British expert has drawn up a scheme of national social insurance and in Syria another British expert has advised on the reform of the taxation system. Even the feudal Government of Saudi Arabia has now accepted British advice in the medical field, and has given facilities to the British Middle East Anti-Locust Unit to carry out a series of large scale anti-locust campaigns in recent years. The Egyptians have indicated their agreement to participate with in the execution of the comprehensive schemes /for us- 10 - for the utilisation of the Nile Waters and the Egyptian Parliament has voted £E4i million as a contribution to the combined hydro-electric station and dam at Owen Palls. Egypt, although more advanced than the other countries in technical knowledge, consults the British Middle East Office on questions of health, locust control, forestry and labour relations. Broadly speaking it may be said that most of the area has been surveyed and there is now sufficient knowledge of what can and should be done* 23. The ideas are set out in numerous reports. The problem today is not so much to search for further ideas as to put into effect those ideas which have been patiently accumulated. 24. Phase 2: Planning Phase 2 is in many ways the most dif ficult phase of the whole operation. It comprises all the stages between the general survey (Phase l) and the request for tenders for specific projects (which is the beginning of Phase 3 )• It may perhaps be divided into three main parts: (a) the establishment by the Govern ments concerned.of the appropriate machinery for the proper planning of development. (b) the selection of the most suitable projects out of those surveyed, in relation to the financial and economic resources of the country /concerned- 11 - conccrned and to the background of regional and world economic development, and the ^ establishment of priorities. (c) decisions by the Governments con cerned with.regard to the extent and method of utilising internal resources and outside financial assistance. 25. Annex C to this Paper contains a short list of (a) the surveys which have been carried out in the various fields of economic and social development and (b) of specific major projects which have boon surveyed. The list is illustrative rather than exhaustive. The main problem which faces us now is the transition from Phase I to Phase 2 and it is on this that our diplomatic and technical effort will have to be concentrated in the immediate future. 26. Phase 3 - Implementation. The obstacle in the path of implent- ation of these schemes are formidable. Inertia, inefficiency and corruption have to be overcome. Lack of trained personnel will be a serious difficulty. Encouragement and assistance will be required from without. 27 . It is for consideration how far most of the Middle East countries are in fact capable of undertaking the requisite work themselves. None the less, there are strong arguments in favour of their being encouraged and assisted to assume the responsibility of doing so and thus acquiring the practice and the pride of tackling their own problems themselves, ra.ther than having them carried out entirely by-1 2 - foreigners or by international organisations, 28, The fact must be faced that the achieve ment of any effective and lasting progress will % probably necessitate in many cases: (a) the reorganisation of the administrat ive machine and tax system; (b) social reform, including reform of land tenure systems; (c) a settled policy of land use, 29. But it must be recognised that such reforms will involve social, political and economic readjustments which it will take many years to bring about. Meanwhile our first aim should be to persuade the Middle East Governments: (a) to set up, where practicable. Central and probably also Area Development Boards, with independent finance, to determine priorities and push ahead with individual projects; (b) to undertake, as soon as possible, with or without a Central Development Board, 'demonstration” projects, to provide a beginning and a means of ascertaining what problems and what expenditure will be involved in any larger projects, 30. A combination of two methods will be required to bring the necessary pressure to bear on the local Governments:- (a) measures of persuasion, e.g# diplomatic pressure, and education, demonstration and publicity to build up a body of public opinion which /GovernmentsI n \ * -13- * ' Governments cannot ignore, and (b) offers of assist ance which, cap be withheld if Governments are ob structive. Such offers can take the form of financial assistance, material supplies, technical expertise and training facilitiesc 31, Though most of the Governments concerned should be able by a reform of the -taxation system to meet their needs in local currency and should in some cases find no difficulty in a few years’ time in meeting their needs.for foreign currency, nevertheless they are likely to require considerable foreign financial assistance in the immediate future to prime the pump. But it must be borne in mind that the sources of such assistance are limited and have many other calls upon them and that in particular His Majesty’s Government are in no position to contribute at all substantially % Some of the materials required too are at present world scarcities, and as long as this state of affairs lasts it will-.bc necessary to'ensure that the Middle Bast countries get their share* Finally, these coun tries will need foreign advisers to help in such matters as reforming their administrations, carrying out research and training, improving social conditions and executing such projects as may be determined. 32• International Q rgani sations Particular importance attaches to the question whether encouragement and assistance to Middle East countries should be afforded principally (a) by His Majesty’s Government and by the U.S. Government or (b) through the medium of the United Nations and its associated organisations. Some of these, e.g. the International Bank, the World Health Organisation, /Organisation-14- Organisation, UNESCO and the Pood and Agriculture Organ isation are already at work in the Middle East. 33# The Foreign Secretary.has expressed a very strong preference for course (a). The State Department have indicated to us that they also incline to this view. If this policy is adopted it will not, of course, mean that there is no role for the U.N. Organisations to play. Assistance from the International Bank will bo a vital requirement and it is to be hoped that the Bank will play a major part in Middle East development. The role of the other organisations would however be sub sidiary. Their activities would as far as possible be confined to the advisory field and in this field steps would be taken to ensure that they did not duplicate the work of the British Middle East Office. We should in any case strongly discourage any tendency for these organisations to undertake executive functions, e.g, in connection with the Nile Waters and the Iraqi Irrig ation and Flood Control projects. We do not wish to see these undertaken under United Nations auspices. 34. C ooperation with the U.S. Government It will probably be desirable to discuss our ideas V/ith the State Department as soon as we succeed in clarifying them. Such a discussion would be a logicdl sequel to the&lt; Washington Talks of October 1947 and to subsequent contacts with the State Department. 35. Recommendations (a) the principle should be endorsed that economic development and social reform in the Middle East are an essential interest of His Majesty*s Government. (b) His Majesty* s Government should use all its influence with the Middle East Governments /Governments-15- Governments towards the implementation of plans for economic development. (c) the Middle East (Official) Committee and its Working party, and other appropriate Committees, should proceed to study, country by country, practical projects with a view to assessing those which, in their view, are likely to be of most immediate benefit to the-Middle East countries and which are capable of early realisation. In this connection it is considered that, whilst financial and other implications must con tinuously be borne in mind, the only real istic method of approach to the general problem is first to make a study of such projects and then to proceed to consider how they should be financed. It may be that at this later stage oxisoing financial policies will themselves have to be reviewed at a high level. But it is not at present possible or desirable to attempt to reach any conclusions in advance of the completion of detailed studies aimed at assessing the cost, both financial and economic, of des irable developments and the extent to which it will or will not be possible to meet them from the resources of the countries concerned, by borrowing from the International Bank or by making use of such bodies as the Overseas Pood Oorporation. Above all, it is important to avoid the danger of preparing elaborate and ambitious paper plans which will be in capable of realisation* /realisation- 16 - roalisation. (d) requests from the Middle East coun tries for British financial, industrial and. technical assistance in the implement ation of plans for such projects should be accorded as high a degree of priority as the circumstances appear to warrant# In this connection it should be borne in mind that several of the Middle East countries come to us for their dollar re quirements and their demands will be all the heavier if we cannot meet their re quirements for capital equipment from the Sterling ^rea. (e) as soon as we have formed a clearer view of what should be done and of the nature of the contribution which His Majesty’s Government can make to its fulfilment we should renew discussion of the whole problem with the U.S. Government with a view to seeing how far * they are prepared to participate# (f) while the policy of cooperation between the British Middle East Office and the United Nations Specialised Agencies (e.g. the PAO and the WHO) should „ RX. • \ cM A HDir-tre discontinue^, assistance to Middle East countries should be furnished by His Majesty's Government and the U.S. Government. Tile diroot intervention of the United Nations in economic hpd social development in the Middle East would afford opportunities for Russia and the satellite countries to ej^tcr the area./ Annex A TERMS OF RE^nR^NCE : (1) To study: (a) the possibilities of economic development throughout the ^ Middle East; that is, Persia and the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant States, the Nile Basin from Egypt to Ethiopia, and the former Italian Colonies; % (b) the scope for British technical, economic and financial participation in the preparation and execution of plans for such development, bearing in mind the necessity for co-ordinating, through the appropriate Government committees, etc* the possible calls on our productive and manpower resources arising from those plans with^ the- calls arising elsewhere, especially in the Colonies; (c) the scope for participation of the United Nations, International Bank and the United States* ( &gt; * (2) To make recommendations whenever_appropriate on the above subjects for submission to the Middle East (Official) Committee, and, if necessary, to the Economic Development Committee, (3) To consider, among the first tasks under the above terms of reference (a) all existing plans for development and to make recommendations on their order of priority and metuod of execution* Attention should particularly be given to the importance of starting certain small pilot projects which have high publicity value. (t&gt;) whether the time has now come for an extension of the work of the B.M.E.O* technicians. Their function at present is to present advaice to foreign Governments on request. Our'suggestion put forward for consideration is that they or some new body should now concern themselves more directly with the preparation and execution of plans for development, i.e. should o-ct moie in the capacity of industrial and financial consultants; (c) the implementation of the plans for Anglo-American economic co-operation in the Middle East which were discussed in November 1947# but which have not yet been put fully into effect ov/ing to disturbed conditions. (See M.E. (0) (47) 28 of 11th November 1947). (d) to what extent the productive resources of other participants in O.E.E.C. could be made available against payment in sterling likely to accrue to Middle East countries in increasing amounts as oil production develops.ANNEX B SECRET ME(0)(47)28 IIth November, 1947 .

An opportunity has recently occurred for holding informal conversations on social and economic affairs in the Middle East with members of United States State Department. A summary memorandum of these conversations is attached for the information and approval of the Committee. 2. This document has the agreement, on an official level, of the State Department, and is being submitted for final approval to Mr. Marshall.

(Signed) T.A.G. CHARLTON R.0. DUNDAS. W. EVERSHSD. (Joint Secretariat)SUMMARY ' EMOR/JTDUM OF INFOR1VIAL CONVERSAame RELATING TO SOCI/EL AND ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN THE MIDDLE EAST Washington, Octohcr 23 to 30, 1947 I Opportunity for informal exchange of viev/s and information and discussion of social and economic affairs in the Middle Bast was afforded by the presence in Washington of Mr. Denis Greenhill of the Mi die East Secretariat, British Foreign Office. Full advantage was taken of this opportunity through a series of frank and informal talks attended by representatives of; the British Treasury delegation in Washington (Mr. A. Christelow), and of the British Embassy in V/ashington (Mr. Anthony E. Percival), in addition to Mr. Greenhill; and by representatives of the interested offices of the Department -f State, namely the Offices of Near Eastern and African Affairs, of European Affairs, of Financial and Economic Development of International Trade Policy, of Transport and Communications, of Information and Educational Exchange, and of Intelligence Research. The subject of British and American interest in the social and economic affairs of the Mi'die East and in the raising of living standards in that area had been raised in a memorandum transmitted by Mr. Bevin to the Secretary of State at Moscow in March 1947. Further explanations of British views and interests in the subject had been communicated in informal conversations between Mr. Greenhill and a representative of the American Embassy at London. Previously, in the spring of 1944, British and American interests in the Middle East had been reviewed in informal conversations held in London between Mr. Wallace Murray, Director of the Office of Near Eastern and African Affairs of the Department of State and officials of the British Foreign Office. Pursuant to th..se conversations, parallel instructions had been transmittod by the Foreign Office and the Department of State to the British and American diplomatic missions in the Middle East in April 1944. These instructions called upon the respective British and American Missions at e; ch post to arrange for the conduct of Anglo-American relations throughout the area in a spirit of cooperation based oh mutual frankness and goodwill. The informal conversations held in V/ashington in October 1947 again demonstrated the usefulness of frank and full informal exchange of views and information between British and American representatives with reference to matters of mutual interest involved in the social and economic affairs of the Middle East. II The point of departure wa the conviction that the maintenance of security and tranquillity in the Middle East is a necessary condition for world peace. A prerequisite for the maintenance of security and tranquillity in the Middle East2 is th-. of the raised Middle United in the raising of peoples of there must liast. It States are host the social cultural and economic standards the area. If these standards are to he he constructive foreign influences in the ^ is considered that Great Britain and the ^among the countries of the world which are position to exercise such constructive influences designed to further the interests and well-being of the peonies of the Middle Dast. It is therefore essential that Great Britain and the United otates cooperate in strengthening each other’s respective positions in the Middle Uast in order' that, hy working with mutual understanding and goodwill, they can attain the objective of assisting the economic and cultural development of the Middle Bast in a manner which will tend to raise its cultural and general economic standards to the benefit of the peoples concerned. It must be understood that in cooperating with each other there is no intention on the part of either Great Britain or the United States or barring or preventing any other country from having free intercourse with the countries of the Middle .^ast ior the purpose of contributin'? in a constructive manner to their economic and cultural advance. In fact, contribution of this character from other like-minded countries would be v/elcorned. I In the light of the foregoing, it was the expressed view of the British and American representatives that in a matter of such importance to both the United States and Great Britain, both Governments should endeavour to prevent either foreign countries, commercial interests, or any other influences from making capital for themselves by plaving Great Britain and the United States off against'each'other. Great Britain and the United States should each follow the general principle that each country endeavour to strengthen th&lt; other’s position in the Middle fast on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation. It should be contrary to their respective policies for either country to make efforts to !strengthen itself or to increase its influence at the expense of the other. The policy of each Government in the Middle Bast is to lend the other all possible and proper support for the attainment of the objective referred to above. In cooperating with each other Great Britain and the United States should, of course, take care not to embark on policies which would tend to curtail the economic freedom of the countries of bho Iviiadle Bast, including their right to engage in free economic and cultural intercourse with other nations. III. The close ffi ity of british and American objectives, and many similarities of method were revealed in this review of social and economic affairs in the Middle' Bast. Representatives on both sides consdored the salient ?)oints which emerged from the informal discussions to be as follows.:. a) Solutions to the urgent social and economic problems of the Mi die Bast along lines compatible with Western concepts and ideals would significantly influence the political orientation of Middle Bast countries. wV f - 3 - t&gt;) Tho rusrjonsibility for the solution of these prebloms should ho carried to the fullest possible extent by the Middle Eastern countries themselves, and whenever practicable the United States and the United Kingdom should seek directly or in directly to encourqge these countries to undertake constructive activity. c) All practical support should be given to sound schemes of economic development designed to raise the general standard of living in Middle Eastern countries. It was recognised that there are inherent difficulties in meeting the immediate problems of the area with such long term solutions. Where large schemes are not yet possible efforts should be made to encourage the establishment of 'sample' projects of an economic size which would serve to stimulate Governments to constructive action at a later date, d) All major development plans for the Mi die East should constantly be considered by tho United States and United Kingdom Governments in the light of their respective commitments and plans for economic recovery, r construction and development elsewhere, e.g., the European Recovery Program and British Colonial Schemes. e) Pending general adoption and implementation of the Charter for an International Trade Organisation, questions of commercial policy which arise with reference to tho area should be dealt with by the United States and the United Kingdom in accordance with the principles embodied in the Geneva Draft of that Charter. Tho two nations have already agreed to act in accordance with the principles set forth in the document entitled 'Proposals for the Expansion of World Trade and Employment' and are parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiated in Geneva in 1947. f) g) It is in tho interest of the countries of the Middle East as well as of the United Kingdom and the United States for the countries of the Middle East to increase their earnings of American dollars. The representatives of both the United Kingdom and the United States accordingly share the opinion that both the British and American Governments should in general with due regard to established channels of trade, pursue p licies which would tend to encourage an increase in exports from the Middle East to the United States. There is an important common interest in the maintenance of conditions in the Middle East which will permit the oil industry to function effectively and to increase its substantial contribution to the raising of the standards of living in the area. Similar considerations apply to the development of civil air facilities. h)/- 4 - h) It is highly important for the United States and United Kingdom to establish by all useful means at their disposal the widest possible cultural and technical links with the countries of the Middle East, and particularly with those groups who may bo most influential in promoting the sound economic and cultural, development of their countries and the raising of the cultural and economic living standards of the population of the Middle East generally. i) The exchanges of information and views effected through these informal conversations demonstrated the advantages and usefulness of such exchanges; and similar opportunities for maintaining close informal contact between representatives of the two Governments on these matters of common interest should be availed of whenever suitable occasion may offer. IV ^mong the various matters with regard to which the representatives of both countries found themselves holding the same views were• a) The desirability of a strengthening of the Economic Committee of the i^rab League Council to enable it tc&gt; function as an instrument of constructive collaboration, .any attempt by the j^rabs to use it for undesirable economic or political objectives should be resisted. b) That the establishment at this time of a United rG S ional economic organisation in the Middle East was not favoured. c) Thc*t fullest informal cooperation between the staff + i tt 4 + 1 ? lo ? a tic missions and consular offices of , t T ?^V ni ^ ea A stGtG s in the various countries of the EGSt tI:lc ot tl:iG British Middle East Office as well as with the staffs of the British diplomatic missions and consular offices should bo encouraged. u ^ to intention of tho Iraqi Government to undertake considerable economic development of ^ Gt n ^. un ^ justifies support. The responsibility c d0 2 ls i ons rest throughout with the Iraqi Government, but consideration should be given to the most effective machinery to be devised to produce quick results, making appropriate use of the projected Central Development Board and existing edvis- GXtent thGt the ^ Government r o 1 ^ b0rr °^ :LGg ncjcc ssary for the implement ation of sound specific projects arising out of its sdould be Liven to application to the International Bank for investment funds. e) 'kkd United States Government is prepared o + Ira Ui Government to coc^ . with the British Government in affording to the Government of Iraq technical advice and aid in development plans. The British Government would welcome such cooperation. /cooperation.I &gt; - 5 - cjopcration. f) That tho balanced dcvolopmont of the national cau cat ion cal syo torns of Middle lias tern countries is of hi^h import .nee, and the Governments of these countries should be encouraged to pay special attention to tho provision of technical education. g) . That the economic and social conditions of Egypt gave cause for concern and justified every appropriate effort being made to induce the Egyptian Government to undertake a progressive domestic development programme involving full use of local capital available. h) That whilst His Majesty’s Government wore at present thinking in terms of a sma.ll technical Nile Board,_the usefulness of creating a Nile Valley ^uthority which would genuinely safeguard the interests of all should b^ further considered. His Majesty’s Government would welcome any observations or suggestions that the United States Government may feel disposed to make in this connection. i) That in the interim, to offset population pressure in Egypt and to permit development in the Sudan, every encouragement should be given to the implementation of suitable existing schemes for tho full utilisation of the Nilu Waters. The fcasability ol, and possible problems involved in, the provision of dollars for financing the Lake Tana project should receive further study. * 0) That it is a mottor of high importance to in closest touch with educated opinion in as in all Middle East countries, and that filling of existing vacancies in Egyptian ities with a carefully selected United Sta Halted Kingdom staff provides an excellent of doing so. keep Egypt, the early univers- tos and method k) That a progressive social and economic programme in • l’u iu nc 9 cssa]? y* u Sample projects' undertaken with the aid of foreign advisers are of value for this purpose. In appropria.te cases support may be given to applications for the financing of sound development projects by the International Bank. l) ihat further exchange of information is desirable in considering the problems of the Single Iranian Oil Company, Arabian American Oil Company, etc., and on the mo.nnor in which the oil companies a.re meeting their problems of employer—employee and government relationships. m) That the economic situation of the Levant States indicates oho desirability of encouraging development on a scale commensurate with their resources. This area might well offer good opportunities of initiating 'sample projects.' n) That pipeline and refinery activities in the Levant might help in relieving the dolla.r situation /situationsituation and should £ivc some employment to sieillcd and semi-skiHod labour thrown out of employment by the departure of the j-illiod forces. o) That the Levant States should be encouraged to seek a friendly and reasonable resolution of their financial difference with the French. Similarly it is desirable that the French should be encouraged to adopt a friendly and reasonable attitude in this regard. p) That British participation in the increasing commercial activity in all parts, of Saudi Arabia would be welcome to the United States Government. q.) That if the employment of any substantial number of foreign experts by the Saudi ^rabian Government becomes a likely prospect, it might bo desirable to consider the formulation of a standard form of contract of employment which would serve to protect the interests of all concerned. r) That in view of the conflicting activities of the various medical organisations in Ethiopia, it would bo desirable if the authority of the Ethiopian Minister of Public Health were built up and future public health activities put under his direction. s) That the United States Government would take note of the fact that His Majesty’s Government, in view of the balance of payment prospects, attached importance to the principle th&amp;t dollars resulting from any dollar loan or royalties be made available for expenditure without restriction in any currency area, and not be confined to payments for supplies, services, etc., provided by the United States only.ANNEX C A• Surveys which have been carried out in the v arious fields o f economic and social development 1• Published reports Re/gorts to the D i rector-General of t he Middle East Supply Centre, ‘(Stationery Office 1946) (i) Middle East Science hy Dr* E.B, Worthington (ii) Agricultural Development of the Middle East by Dr* B.A. Keen* (iii) Rural Education and Welfare in the Middle East by Dr. H.B.

The decision of the Bank will also he subject to the report of a technical mission to be sent to Bagdad during the summer. Bayne also considers that the Bank would agree to send one or two representatives here for some months to help organise the Development Board, if the Iraqis are agreeable* 2. I strongly support Bayne's proposals. I am convinced that the Bank should give preference to the Haigh Commission projects which are by far the most important projects for the development of Iraq's resources and‘the execution of which should be started without delay. Iraq Government have put forward other schemes also which have their strong backing: but Nuri Pasha in his previous request to Engert included river control schemes in those for which a loan would be required and I think that Iraqi Government will agree to go ahead with these schemas, if the Bank offer to finance them. 3. The Bank's mission must come here in June, since they will not be able to undertake their work here satis factorily in July, August and September owing to the severe heat and the absence from Bagdad during those months of many of the persons most concerned. I understand that this will mean some alteration of the Bank's present arrangements, but , I hope that it will be urged very strongly. I. I am continuing to press the Iraqi Government on the two points on which the Bank, like ourselves, requires satisfaction. A Bill for the constitution of a Development Board is now being drafted'and the Prime Minister is^trying to put it through immediately. The Bill is not^entirely in accordance with our ideas as, although the Prime ixinister says that the Board will have at least five^permanent members (he mentioned All Mumtaz and Arshad al Umari as possibles), it will also include the .Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and the Minister of the department responsible for the subject being discussed by the Board at the time. . The ' association of Ministers to this extent may be inescapable if the Board is to be. given adequate powers andto avoid political obstruction. I haye urged Nuri to give time for consultation .with us' and'I have sent the Regent ^ a message invoking his assistance. Jamali, who agrees .with us, is trying to get consideration of the'Bill^postponed until the draft has been sent to the-Bank for .their comments. _ It will have to be put to Parliament fairly soon, however, slll ^ e Parliament adjourns from July until December. ^ I snail le^ vou know developments.

They are likely to propose to the Bank orher schemes also, such as railway development. I hope that the Bank will not he diverted from giving preference to the river control schemes, and that we can finance essential railway development through loans raised in London. 5. The following financial points are of importance. (1) Provision of sterling portion of loan. Bayne thinks that His Majesty’s Government will he prepared to use a portion of the United Kingdom's sterling contribution which has not yet been called up. (2) Provision of foreign exchange for repayment of the loan. Some form of indirect assignment of I.P.C. royalty will be required by Bank. Bayne has asked for estimate of this royalty over a period of years as I.P.C. production develops. I shall ask Wheatley when he returns in the next few days if he can supply this for Bank’s information. Bayne contemplates a subsidiary agreement with United Kingdom Treasury for conversion of Iraqi sterling for servicing and renayment of dollar portion of loan. (3) Financing of internal expenditure. Bank will presumably not wish to undertake this. Iraoi Government will however have some difficulty in finding “the amount required, since I see no prospecr of a successful internal loan being floated for some time. This must await examination by Bank’s technical mission. 6 . I hope that you will agree to support Bayne’s proposals through United Kingdom representative on the Bank. Bayne said that he might have some difficulty in convincing others in the Bank and was anxious that strong support of his views by myself and United States Ambassador here should be made known to the Bank. The United States Embassy has seen this telegram and concur generally. They are.reporting to State Department on the same lines. Crawford of B.M.E.O. also concurs. I suggest that United Kingdom Treasury Delegation might show this telegram to Iliffe.IT PERSIA’S SEVirrl-YB^R PL,iN Note ~by the Joint Secr et aries W e circulate herewith for the information of the Committee a Memorandum hy the Foreign Office on Persia's Seven-Year Plan* Cahinet Office, S.'' . 1 • 19th April, 1949.(E 2499/1103/34) tm PERSIA* S SEVEN YEAR PLAN . 3r&gt; The Plan was first announced in the Spring of 1946, but this Plan which would have cost a total of about 450 million pounds was far beyond the financial capacity of the Persian Government and in order to arrive at a more selective programme and to be able to judge which schemes were economically sound, the Persian Government invited a Commission of United States engineers to visit the country. The Commission arrived at the end of 1946, and after completing their investigations, they submitted a report to the Persian Government in July, 1947. The general finding of the Commission was.that Persia*s major efforts should be directed tov/ards an increased efficiency in agricultural production and it was emphasised that industry should be left to develop slowly and naturally. The planners prepared a list of schemes which they considered should be carried out under the 250 million dollar programme. The present bill is based on this report and envisages a development programme to be carried out in 7-8 years at a cost of 21,000 million rials or at the official rate of exchange, some 160 million pounds to be expended as follows For the year 1948-49 1 ,000 million rials i» 11 11 1949-50 2,000 n 11 it 11 11 1950-51 2,800 it 11 ti 11 it 1951-52 3,200 11 11 11 n 11 1952-53 3,500 11 11 ti it 11 1953-54 3,600 it 11 it 11 n 1954-55 3,600 11 ti it 11 11 1955-56 2,200 ♦ 1 ti The importance of the present Plan lies in the fact that it is the first attempt to carry out a long-term Plan of economic reform in Persia which has been effectively prevented in recent years by the lack of continuity in governments (there have been some 90 governments in the 42 years since the proclamation of the Constitution) and according to Article 1 of the Lav/ the Plan is designed ’’for the purpose of increasing the productive capacity and expansion in the volume of exports, preparing public requirements at home, improvement in agriculture and industry, exploitation of mines and other resources especially oil, completion of means of transport, reforms in public health and for carrying out measures in the development of the country, raising the general standard of life and education, bettering employment conditions and reduction in the cost of living”. For these various purposes, the total sum available has been allotted hs follows Million rials. Agriculture and irrigation 5,£5^ Motor-roads, railways, ports, and aerodromes 5,000 Extension and development of industries, exploration and exploitation of mines 3,000 Iranian Oil Company 1 ,000Million rials Extension of post, telegraph, wireless, radio and telephone 750 Building of cheap houses 1,500| creation of water-systems and supply 1,000' of power to the provinces Prevention of disease and prophylactic measures with the object of improving public health ♦. .. 1,500 Aid to educational institutions and training of technical experts .. ,, 1,000 Scientific studies and research map-making preparation of statistics and other works of public utility 800 Prisons 200 The question of financing the execution of the Plan has still to be settled and is likely to present difficulties as the sum available from the A.I,0.C’s royalties which have been ear-marked for development projects^inside Persia over the next seven years will depend on the result of the Company’s present negotiations with the Persian Government, The Persians have also still to negotiate a loan for specific development projects from the International Bank, These difficultdes should, not, however, prevent the Government proceeding with the. first year’s programme and, provided the political situation permits, the Persians should be in a position to make a start shortly on those essential measures of economic development to which we attach the greatest importance as the only sure defence against Communism, * - The Government have already engaged an American group - Overseas Consultants Incorporated - to draw up a report on the priorities to be given to the various projects included in the Plan and an advance party of this group with which the British firm Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners is associated is now in Tehran. Mr, Murray of the B.M.E.0. has been asked to supervise the statistical work and the Americans have also agreed in principle to the engagement of an expert from the Port of London Authority to advise on port clearance problems. According to the Law as now passed the report which is to be prepared by this group is now to be submitted to the Persian Planning Organisation v/ithin three months. The Bill provides for a Supreme Planning Authority, . consisting of an Advisory Council of seven members, a Board of Control of six -members and a Managing Director. As originally drafted, the Advisory Council would be appointed by the Shah on the proposal of the Government 'and would hold office for the whole period of the programme. The Managing Director would be appointed for three years but his appointment could be renewed for the remaining period of the Plan. The Board of Control would be elected by the Majlis and would hold office for two years. The Government of the Day would be connected with the Planning Organisation through the Board of Control/ *. i .^ Control v/hich would have the right to report direct to '^2 the Government and might be charged by the Government to carry out investigationsc The Planning Organisation are required to obtain the approval of the Council of Ministers before employing foreign experts who may be employed for a period not exceeding one year after the period of the execution of the programme. In passing the Law, the Majlis have amended the draft Bill to ensure that all appointments to the Planning Organisation should be approved by them before being confirmed by the Shah and have stipulated that credits under the Plan should only be used for paying technical personnel and not for increasing salaries,. They have also laid down that the Planning Authority is to be staffed with Civil Servants drawn from Ministries who will continue to receive their present salaries. We have not received full details of these amendments but it would seem that the Majlis have now imposed a stricter control on the authority of the Advisory Council to carry out the programme on its own authority once it has been approved by the Seven Year Plan Commission of the Majlis* This is unfortunate as it may complicate the practical application of the Plan* It is, however, to be hoped that the Persians will appreciate the necessity for engaging foreign experts to assist the Planning Organisation in the detailed execution of the programme and that these advisers will be able to prevent to some extent the Government of the Day frittering away the sums allotted to the various projects in the grant of fictitious contracts to their friends and supporters. Both His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government have on all possible occasions stressed the importance of economic development and reform to the Shah and to the Persian Government« It is to be hoped that the satisfactory co-operation established between the American group of Overseas Consultants and the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners in the initial planning stages of the programme is symptomatic of the collaboration which can be expected in the measures which are to be taken in the later stages to raise the standard of living in Persia and to improve the social and economic position of the Persian peasant who has for so long been exploited by a small and wealthy minority of land-owners and merchants,,CO NFIDENTIAL M.E.(0)(49) 7 • UlTH APR IL, 1949 * CABINET MIDDLE EAST (OEFIOIAL) COMMITTEE RECONSTITUTION OP THE COMMITTEE Note by the S ecretary of the Cabinet In view of the additional functions assigned to it by C.P.(49) 83, the Committee has been reconstituted as follows. 2.

Missions in the Middle East; (b) U.S, Missions in the Mi die East; (c) The Administrations of the Former Italian Colonies; (d) The British Oil Companies; (e) The British Middle East Office; (f) The Sudan Government. 2. From the facts summarised in paragra hs 3-5 'below the following conclusions may be drawn: (a) Out of the 7-800,000 refugees there is likely to be a considerable M unresettleable core' of orphans and old and infirm people v/ho will reguire relief for many years to come; (t&gt;) Except in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the former Italian Colonies, the immediate settlement of the refugees is not li ely to present any outstanding political difficulty in the various Arab States; from a Ion er-term point of view internal political difficulties mr.y arise in connexion with the question of introducing modern forms of land onwership and organisation in the areas to be re-settled; (c) The short-term economic possibilities of absorption in the Arab countries are not promising.; As a rough estimate about 100,000 refuge'es might be • ■ absorbed within the next two years. Funds from outside sources would, however, have to be provided to finance some of the projects involved. (d) From a long-term point of view all the refugees could be absorbed in Transjordan, Syria and Iraq if ■development plans which have been or are now being prepared foi* these countries are carried out.- As a very rough estimate at a total expenditure of £10 million on cap tal works and equipment these plans o ould enable resettlement to be completed in four or five years time. (e) The position may be summed up as follows:- Over~half the refugees are in Transjordan, Transjordan-Administered Arab Palestine and Syria. If Transjordan and Syria can obtain assistance from outside sources in funds and capital equipment to carry out their development plans there is a reasonable prospect that these refugees can be gradually absorbed in these two countries. There is no possibility that the 200,000 or more refugees in the Gaza area of Arab Palestine (which is now administered by Egypt) can be absorbed into that country (though it is presumably just possible that the Egyptian Govern er.t ’ s attitude might change if this area were to be incorporated in Egypt as the result of the eventual peace settlement2- ( in Palestine). Nor can the L eh an an absorb more than a very small proportion O' the 120,000 refugees in her territory, Betv/een 300 and 350 thousand refugees will, therefore, probably have to be cared^ for by outside relief for at least two or three years until land for their settlement becomes available in Iraq and Syria. * • 3* Description of the Refugees It has not yet been possible for the United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees to take a census of the refugees end no accurate estimate of their numbers are available* Reports from various sources place the total between seven and eight hundred thousand distributed as fallows Gaza area in Southern Palestine: upwards of 200,000. Transjordan Transjordan-administered Arab Palestine) 300,000 ) Lebanon 120,000 Syria 115,000 (of which 85,000 are cared for by the United Nations). Iraq 20,000 Egypt (Kantara camp): 10,000 About 70/o are reported to be peasants, and the remainder urban types. About 70P of the total are woman and childreh. It is not yet possible to estimate the size of the 'unresettleable core 1 ' - i.e orphans and old and inarm people v/ith no wage-earner to support them - but some reports suggest that it may prove disproportionately large. 4« Attitude of the Arab Governments towards resettlement Political Reactions . The Arab Governments necessarily regard the question of the resettlement of the refugees as part of the wider question of the whole political settlement with Israel. They have, in most cases, deliberately re rained from considering the possibilities of resettlement. It remains to be seen whether the Conciliation Commission, at the Conference which it has called for March 2pth, can stimulate them into fading realities. Meanwhile, tv/o Governments - those of Transjordan and Syria - are understood to be in principle willing to absorb the refugees at present in their countries, this would involve about half the total number, including those in Transjordan-administerQ.^ Arab Palestine. If circumstances were to alter the present official Arab policy, which is to insist on repatriation, Iraq and Lebanon would probably agree in principle to accept a proportion of the refugees, although in the Lebanon there might be some opposition from the Christian minority and the Shias in Iraq might object to a large influx of Sunnis. Bgypt and Saudi' Arabia, on the other hand, will almost certainly oppose entry of the refugees in any circumstances - in the case of/- 3 - of Egypt, on account of her growing uaerpplojmont and social discontent and in the case of Saudi-Arahia on account of the ,political embarrassment * which the presence of people \f*Nd to'British standards of administration and personal and political freedom would cause. There would also be political difficulties in accepting refugees in Cyrenaica and Eritrea (owing to xenophobia; and in Tripolitania (owing to the hostility of the local Italians). In general, in view of the backwardness and social instability of these countries, the settlement in them of any large numbers of refugees on terms which may involve the introduction of modern forms of Ian-’ ownership and social organisation may pr sent r eat political difficulties, 5. Economic possibilities of absorption : (a) Short-term The renorts on thd short-term possibilities- of absorption are not encouraging. They may be summarised as follows: Trans.Iordan: 40,000 (ir-luding dependents) might be absorbed within two yeafcs on irrigation and settlement projects which could be put in hand at once if funds were forthcoming. The cost of -the projects is estimated at about £600,00. Additional small numbers might be employed on road construction. Tripolitania: 600 families - say 3&gt;000 refugees - might be settled in Tripolitania. They would, however, ffaquirG financial assistance for several years to come, Saudi Arabia . Aramco could probably absorb about 1,000 skilled and unskilled workers - say 5&gt;000 refugees, including dependents. Small numbers might be absorbed pn other public works. The political opposition referred to above would, however, first have to be overcome. Iraq : There is little scope for limited development projects, Lebanon: Only very small numbers could be absorbed ' ' at present. There is considerable unemployment in the country now. Syria: No great possibility of immediate absorption ^ exists - there is at present some unemployment in Syria. But if development schemes now planned were put in hand urgently and vigorously, (see below) resettlement could probably begin fai.lv soon. Sudan: The possibilities of a resettlement sc :eme__are now being studied by the Executive Council. Finance from outside sources would almost certainly be required Trans-Arabian Pipeline : There is some possibility that a limited number of refugees may be absorbed by work on the pipe-line. The U.S. Government is understood to be discussing this with the T.A.P. Company. British Oil Companies/~ - v4 - British Oil Companies : Tho A.I.O.C, the I.F.C• and the Kuwait Oil Company have ‘been asked to consider whether they c ;:n employ any numbers of refugees # ^ They are unlikely to he able to absorb more than a small number. (b) Long-term Transjordan ; Outline plans already exist for a major irrigation scheme in the Jordan Valley. It is estimated that this scheme, if pressed ahead vigorously, could provide settlemjnt for about 100,000 people in four or five years time. In addition, there are possible long-term projects for road construction, port development etc. Finance would, however, have to be made available from outside sources. The total cost of the works was estimated . in 1938, at £ 2 , 600,000 and would probably now be double this figure. Syria : There arc estimated to be about Id. million acres , of cultivable waste land in the Jezira area in Syria. The land is rainfed and requires only men and machinery to get it into production. As a very rough estimate, his area might absorb 200,000 refugees# It development, however, will depend largely on the developmot of road and rail communications, which ■is provided for the Syrian Government is new Five- Year flan. The Syrian Government will certainly require financial help from outside sources to ca ry out this Plan. • ' • Iraq : If work on the plans which’ have beeji prepared for irrigation development in the Euphrates valley proceeds according to plan, irrigated land should begin to become available for settlement in about two years 1 time. The first stage of these plans should provide for irrigation of‘'about 2 'million acres at a cost of £’2 m. This could provide for the settlement of up to 500,000 people, The long-term economic possibilities of absorption in any other iddle East country are considered to be slight.IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT IN IRAQ. (Previous reference: M.E.(0)(47) 3 of January 16th, 1947) I. It will be recalled that Mr,, P.P 8 Haigh was appointed by the Iraq Government early in 1946 as head of a British Irrigation Development Commission, v/hich was to undertake a comprehensive survey of irrigation, water storage, flood control and land drainage possibilities, and draw up plans for construction works for the Iraq Government. The Commission has now completed a general survey of these possibilities, and drawn up detailed plans for the first stage of development, i.e* the construction of water storage works. The final report has yet to be written but a preliminary report has been presented by Mr, Haigh which describes the results of the Commission^ investigations. Irrigation Developme n t Programme. 2. The total area at present served by irrigation in Iraq is about 6,800,000 acres 0 The works proposed aim at extending this area by the addition of about 9 million acres. The total cost is estimated at £113. millions, divided as follows Flood control and storage Irrigation development Drainage Power Navigation £25.4 £36.5 £ 40.2 £7.8 £3.0 million H II II II Total £113 . 0 million With a population of some 4 millions Iraq is not at present over-populated. Development of irrigation and power resources must therefore necessarily take place gradually, and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture. The Irrigation Commission considers that the full development outlined above is unlikely to be required before the end of the century 0 Spread jut over this period, the cost would involve an average annual expenditure of about £2# million only. Meanwhile, the immediate needs are flood control, limited irrigation development and drainage in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a programme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £24 5 200,000 or £ 2 , 420,000 per annum (See part II below). Work on the first stage of the Euphrates project /&gt; project is already in hand. The Commission’s recommendations for the Tigris have now beeu studied by the^ Consulting Engineers who have recommended an alternati Thp?^^ 10 * 1 ot 1 '° rks wUioh would be rattier more expensive. 4 -u colmneijdatlons are summarised in Part II below, en e Iraq Government has taken a decision as between these recommendations and those of Mr. Haigh, it is hoped w?thnn+ e r fl +i Bt St , a ^ e of tae works will be put in hand without further delay. Finance: Commission anticipates that a large of the capital expenditure will be recovered fnn thot i ncrea3e values resulting from the works, &lt; tnat revenue suiticient to make the various projects productive will be obtained. They have submitted detailed proposals to the Iraq Government for a taxation system o cover the cost of the works, involving the levying of taxes on urban property, irrigated land and the crops produced. Meanwhile the Iraqi Prime Minister has made a of 111 ^ V /nnn q ^ eSt ^ tric Il:it -rnational Bank for a loan x £11,250,000 to meet part of the cost of the first ten year programme. International Bank experts are now Ira( 3, b ^ t . it is considered most unlikely that they e V- at tllls stage, to recommend thas. the Bank xou d advance more than a very small proportion of this s urn. Future of the Commission: Th ? 4 .p aigd Irr&gt;i 8'ation Commission is now being d&gt; although Mr ‘ Haigh himself, with a nucleus g of ^sngineers, is remaining in Iraq until the end of June. It is hoped that the Iraqi Government will then f rolon S Mr. Haigh’s contract until early in 1950 m order to enable him to write up and publish his It iS GlS0 h °P ed thnt a Development ^ Irrigation Department will now be set up^ a Hritish irrigation engineer whose functions would ( a ) To continue the work of the Commission in planning the construction of smaller storage works, distribution works, and land drainage, (b) To keep alive and interpret to the Iraq Government the work of the Commission. II. The British Irrigation Commission’s latest follows•- Qted the 20th I)ecember ’ 1 ^ 6 &gt; be summarised as /o)T Vt&gt; (1) Water Storage ^./orks: Euparates 5. (a) _ The Coimpission has drawn up detailed plans and designs for the development of the existing flood control works at the Hahhaniyah lake* This development should ensure flood control of the river and will provide water for the irrigation of about 2 million acres. The estimated cost of the works is £3,375,000. The work is planned to proceed in two stages, the first stage, which would cost £2 millions and would provide irrigation water for 750,000 acres, has already been put in hand and could, it is estimated, be completed in two years; (b) Additional flood control and water storage can be provided by the construction of a reservoir utilising the Abu Dibbis and Bahr—al—Iviilh depressions. This project has not yet been surveyed in detail but a preliminary investigation indicates that its cost will be about £2 million and that it will provide irrigation water for 750,000 acres. Tigris: k* A number of alterurtive projects and combination of projects for water storage on the Tigris have been examined. As a result, the Commission has ‘now recommended to the Iraq Government ( c ) that the V/adi Tharthar project should be developed as the main flood control and water storage reservoir for the Tigris, (see M.E. (0)(47&amp; paragraph 5). This project, wnich can be carried out by stages, involves the construction of a barrage across the Tigris at Samarra and of long inlet and outlet channels. Tne first stage, which will provide for flood control only, is estimated to cost £7 million. The second stage will cost an additional £7i million, and, in conjunction with the Gibraltar and Dokhan dams described below, will provide irrigation water for over 6 million acres. It is considered that this project will alone ensure complete flood control of the Tigris and its tributaries except on rare occasions. The Commission recommends that, to make flood control cumplete and also to provide additional irrigation water, the Tadi Tharthar project would be supplemented by: (d) A dam at the Gibraltar site on the Diyala. This project has been prepared in detail and is estimated to cost £2,580,000; (e) A dam at Dokhan on the lesser Zab. Plans for this project are being drawn up. it is estimated that it will cost about £3 million. (11) Irrigation Development . 7» In addition to the water storage works described /above,above, the development of irrigatiuii involves the construction of distribution works i. e. canals and their appertinent works. Detailed designs for these distribution works have not yet been prepared. In the absence of such designs the cost of these works which will provide for the irrigation of about 9 million acres, is roughly estim; ted as follows: Euphrates extensions; Lesser Zab extensions: The Ishaqi, Diyala and Nahrwan areas Lower Tigris areas £10.5 millions £4-00 millions £8,35 millions £ 13 * 75 millions Total £36,5 millions (3) Drainage,. 8. In Iraq, experience has shown that drainage is essential if the productivity of irrigated lands is to be maintained. Without it irrigated lands are liable to become saline or waterlogged. The Commission has, therefore, strongly recouinended th t all areas both of existing irrigation and new development should be provided with an adequate drainage system. Several small drainage schemes have been worked out in detail and from these a gross, rate has been calculated. The total cost is estimated as follows:- Old irrigated area requiring drainage: 3.41 million acres £11 millions. New irrigated area: 9 million acres; £ 29.2 millions Total £40.2 millions (4) Hydro-electric power: 9* The power development possibilities of the development scheme outlined in paragraph I above are small, since economical water storage requires low dams which resultin little and expensive power. The quality of power which it is estimated can be produced at each site and the appropriate cost (including construction of power station, /generating^neratiiig plant and transmission are as follows: Sites Wadi Th artbar Gibraltar dam Dokhan dam Total Power K.

These works have not been worked out in detail. The total cost might be ab^ut £3 millions. P,l. a .P at Works for the next ten years; The Commission has recommended-the following plan of works for the next ten years: Storage works: Cost Completion of Habbaniyah project - stage I £2 million Completion of Wadi Tharthar project - stage I £7 million Construction of Gibraltar dam on the Diyala £2,580,000 Drainage in old areas at a rate of £500,000 p.a. £5,000,000 Irrigation Development: £7,623,000 Total £24,200,000 Consulting Engineers' Re sport 12, The Iraq Government's Consulting Engineers, Messrs, Goode, Vaughan-Lee, Frank and Gwyther, have examined the Commission's recommendations for the Tigris in conjunction /withwith Sir William Halcruw and Partners, They consider that ^* e ? re stron ^ technical. objecti ^ns to the use of the Wadi Tharthar depression for irrigation storage, sixice the nigh water levels involved would impose a heavy strain on the long length of embankment required and constitute + (3 ® riSc : r Bagdad. They have therefore recommended that the Wadi Th rthar project should be carried out for r w2°fL C ^ itrQl onl y* at an estimated cost of £6y millions, and that a project, rejected hy the Haigh Commission, ior a dam on the Greater Zab at Bekhme should be undertaken for irrigation storage, at an estimated cost oi £y millions. This dam might be supplemented later by the construction of further dams on the Lesser Zab and the Diyala. Mr. Haigh has now written a further paper in which he endeavours to dispel the Consulting Engineers fears about the development of the Wadi Tharthar, and it remains to be seen which opinion the Iraq Government will accept. Middle East Secretariat Foreign Office, 1st April, 1§49.j i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MiATESTY f S In 1946 ths Syrian Government engaged Sir Alexander Gitfb and Partners to carry out an economic survey of* country and recommend particular projects for development. Their report which was submitted early in 1947 recommended the following particular projects: (a) A water supply scheme for Aleppo; (b) The development of Latakia, Syria’s only port; (c) Construction of a barrage on the Euphrates to provide for hydro-electric power and irrigation development; (d) The construction of a road and rail network to enable the important agricultural area in the Jezira in northern Syria to be opened up. Five-Year Development Plan 2 0 The Syrian Government had until recently adopted an attitude of economic isolationism refusing to seek financial assistance for development from outside sources or to employ more than one or two foreign technical experts. The Gibb report remained pigeon holed. This attitude, however, is now changing. The Government has just announced that a Five-Year Development Programme is being drafted which will include the projects referred to above, and, as a beginning, a contract for the construction of tne Aleppo water supply has been awarded to a French firm.

Of th# Tarlout aroas in ttjrla which offer scope for agricultural development the Jeslreh la the moat Important (a) It la a larga area and, if farmed on sound up-to-date lines. It can make a valuable contribution towards food production, whilst at the same time adding materially to the wealth of Syria Itself. (Existing official statistics place the area cultivated in the Jezireh In 1946 at 78^,000 acres, and the cultivable waste area at more than It million acres. Whilst these figures must be accepted as estimates and not actualities, they show that there Is immense scope for development). (b) The nature of the terrain Is such that the tract Is particularly suitable for mechanised farming, a fortunate circusistance for a country such as Syria with large areas capable of development and an Inadequate Indigenous population to carry It out. (c) Although the maximum utilisation of the waters of the fclver xhabour can produce a material increase in the area under irrigated farming, some years must elapse before that condition can be achieved, since it requires the building of barrages, the construction of canals, the provision of pumps, lifts and other equipment. Ralnfed farming, however, is to-day and will continue in the future tb be the principal system of cultivation in this area, another fortunate circumstance where quick and relatively Inexpensive development is needed. For the rapid exploitation of the agricultural resources in the Jezireh the immediate requirements are considered to be men and machinery. a CommunlcatIona. In planning the development and full utilisation of the land resources of the Jezireh, an inseparable problem is the simultaneous development of communications. At present the Jezireh is extremely isolated. No all-weather road enters it and the whole north of the district - the area of highest rainfall and hence of greatest agricultural potential - is cut off by road after rain. Within the district also constructed roads are entirely absent except for short distances east and west of Kamichliye. Any programne of agricultural development should link up, therefore, with a corresponding cooinunlcations' programme, if the maximum good is to result. machinery . Mechanisation is already a prominent feature of the agricuSusr of the Jezireh. Of the estimated 300 farm ti'actore now operating in Syria, about 2C0 are believed to be concentrated in the Jezireh alone, which le estimated to have also 140 combine- harvesters, apart from other complementary farm machinery., This good beginning now needs to be followed up in two main directions (a) Action to secure that there le set up in the area an adequate and efficient organisation to handle the maintenance and repairs of tractors and other machines. Manufacture vm/ /2^ Manufacturer* of British tractor* ampha*!** that they ar* unwilling to supply their product* to countries which have not already made adequate and suitable provision in this direction# 9 Some of them also insist that countries send their representatives to Great Britain for a short but intensive course of study in both the mechanism of their tractore and the practical handling of them in the 1ield# An idea of the importance attached in British mechanised farming to a sound servicing and maintenance organisation and all that this involves is given in my note 'The Organisation of Mechanised Framing in Great 3ritain M # (b) Action to obtain a large number of additional tractor* and connected machines for the area# The prospects of Great Britain being able to make a contribution towards the supply of suitable tractors are indicated in my recent note 'Latest Developa»nts In British Tractors'. It is apparent that this contribution will require to be reinforced by purchases of American tractors also# British manufacturers are likely to be able to make large supplies of ploughs, cultivators, seed drills and other Implements of cultivation# America will be the main source of supply of combine-harvesters# Man-power # It seems most desirable that the Government of Syria should give very early consideration to its future policy in regard to the agricultural development of the Jeslreh# In particular the following questions call for answers:— 1. Is future development to be left to haphazard private enterprise, as appears to have been the case hitherto, or is it to be put by Government on the properly organised basis by which alone the maximum benefits will be obtained in the minimum time? 2# To what extents is the area to be developed on a fully mechanised and on a peasant cultivator basis? The decisions taken on these points must inevitably have repercussions on both the exact nature of the action to be taken and the rapidity or tardiness of development# In regard to the first of these questions the advantages of development through a suitably organised Public Utility Corporation or similar Body merit careful exploration# Xi oyria is in doubt as to the merits of such an organisation, or as to its capacity for sound development, it is suggested that those doubts will be dispelled quickly if a visit at high level is paid by byrla to see at first hand the achievement of the Sudan Plantations' Syndicate. A full account of the organisation, functions and manner of working of the Syndicate has already been supplied to the Director of Agriculture, Syria# Any alterations necessary in that organisation to make it suitable lor eyrian requirements could be made without difficulty# If conditions of land tenure and other local circumstances affecting the operations of such a corporation already suit or can be arranged to suit it, the practical advantages of development by such means are numerous, e.g.:- 1. It can relieve Government of various functions which in other/other circumstances OOTernment should perform. 2. It can provide the capital outlay for the supply of the mechanised equipment necessary to develop the area on a lar.e scale, and it can operate that equipment on a hire-contract basis. It can provide and run the maintenance ana servicing facilities necessary for the efficient operation of this machinery. 3* It can provide the technical organisation necessary for the eiiiclent cultivation and development of the large tract within its sphere of activity. 4* It can undertake or assist in the development of the water resources of the area and their utilisation for agricultural purposes. 5* It can undertake the organisation of the marketing of the produce. 6. By thorough cultivation, the use of the most modern scientific technique, the adoption of crop rotations suited to the needs and possibilities of the locality, the rational use of fertilisers, good seed, the control of Insect pests and diseases, in short, by the adoption of sound crop husbandry, it will obtain the greatest return from the land at least cost and in the shortest time: simultaneously it will secure uniform development throughout the area. Another organisation whose methods of working repay study is the Overseas Food Corporation of Great Britain. This organisation derives the finance with which it operates from a grant of £55. million sterling, voted by the British Parliament. Its first activities have been directed to the well-known £ast African Groundnuts Scheme, a project to bring under cultivation over 3 million acres of land, hitherto Jungle, for the production of groundnuts and crops in rotation therewith. More recently, in conjunction with the Government of Queensland, the Corporation has been associated with setting up a nueensland-Brltish Pood Corporation under their Joint auspices, with the immediate task of cultivating 250,000 acres of land, now grmxing, for the production of certain food grains. Of the •stimatad capital expenditure of £2j millions Australian on this project, the Corporation is to provide £2 millions and the Government of Queensland £j million. It is understood that the Corporation has been exploring the possibilities of assisting in the similar development of a large tract of country in New Guinea* These particular organisations are mentioned in order to give an idea of the scale on which such Bodies work and the functions which they perform, so that Syria may consider the feasibility of bringing into being some such Body for the development of the Jezlreh. Naturally no organisation of this nature will be prepared to function without adequate security against the termination of contract with changes of Government, and it will require a long period arrangement in view of its considerable investment. The remarks in the foregoing paragraphs are relevant to the question of man-power requirements for the agricultural development of the Jezireh, as different types of development will require different degrees of intensity of agricultural labour: mechanisation/k mechanisation under a fully regimented Corporation programme making the fullest use of the land will require one decree of human labour: mechanisation of the present individually run type will need a different rate: cultivation by animal power on a peasant baaie will have entirely different and vastly greater needs than either of them 9 for example:- (a) On the dOO f OOC acres cultivated by the Sudan Plantations Syndicate where cropping 9 as in Jezireh 9 is also mainly of the one-season-a-year type but 9 unlike it 9 is done entirely under lrrlgation 9 each tenant and his family has an area of 1*0 acres on which all the initial ploughing and ridging operations are performed for him by mechanisation. The tenant keeps no cattle; he merely provides the human labour element, (b) On the Sudan &lt;vhlte Nile Schemes where there is no mechanisation and where cultivation is done by communally- owned bullocks 9 the holding of each tenant and hie family is Id acres of irrigated land, (e) On the Italian Demographic Settlement in Trlpolltanla where cultivation ia by animal drawn Implements 9 the area controlled by the cultivator and his family may be 25 acres entirely lrrlgated 9 or 60 p.cres of which 12 are irrigated* or from 75 to 150 acres all ti. which ia rainfed land, according to local conditions of soil and climate. (d) The original estimates of the East African Groundnuts' Scheme, where as in most of the Jezireh, cropping is rainfed, calculated that one man will be sufficient to provide the entire human labour requirements for the agricultural operations on 100 acres when the land is in full production. It may be assumed that he will be accompanied by his wife and family. These data give some indication of the dgree to which agricultural labour is absorbed by different types of large-scale organised farming under Eastern conditions. The ability or otherwise of Syria to provide labour on any comparable scale for the development of the agricultural resources of the Jezireh calls for consideration. Data in regard to population, cultivated and culturable waste land in Syria are contained in an official publication covering 1946, The figures relevant to the present subject have been suosnarlsed in the attached statement. It should be understood clearly that the existing methods of collecting agricultural statistics in Syria are very imperfect and that the data here presented are estimates rather than actualities. Accepting the figures at their face values it will be observed that - 1 1• The total population of Syria is less than 3 millions, 2, The cultivated area is estimated at under 5i million acres, 3# The culturable waste is estimated to be more than 8^ million acres, 4* The population of the country as a whole represents 515 persons of all ages, both urban and rural, per 1,000 acres of cultivated land in Syria. 5. The/5. The corresponding figure for the Jesireh is only 190 persons per 1,000 acres of cultlTstion* 6. The total population of Syria represents 207 persons of all ages in town and country per 1,000 acres of combined cultivated land and culturable waste* 7* The corresponding figure for the Jesireh is only 5® persons per 1,000 acres* This figure includes women and children, the industrial, business, professional and other town dwellers as well as rural inhabitants* 6. It would seem that the figures for agricultural labourers must be accepted with reserve* Thus it is difficult to believe that out of a total population of 229,232 shown for th&lt; Euphrates district - an area lacking a town of any very considerable else - agricultural labourers should nunfcer only 22,300, or lees than lOt of the whole* For what it may be worth, however, the data shows that agricultural labourers (male and female) in the Jesireh average only 20 per 1,000 acres cultivated and culturable, or 50 acres per labourer* Since two-thirds of the labourers of the district are shown as males, the area in terms of male labour is 75 acres for each man* No information is available as to whether or not children are Included in these figures, or if omitted, from what age they find a place in them. If they are included the effective agricultural man-power ie at a very low level* At best it is probably no more, fcnd may be lees, than the ratio of man to area estimated as adequate for the Bast African Orcundnuts Scheme under a system of farming which is 1(X&gt;^ mechanised* It must also be remembered that the iast African figure is still an unproved estimate which may eventually be found to be inadequate to requirements. Cbviously, too, the particular crops which are grown and the crop rotations which are adopted will affect the final requirements of agricultural labour* Cne arrives at the general conclusion, therefore, that if the Jezireh ie to be developed to any appreciable extent it will be necessary to import agricultural labour into it, whatever the type pf cultivation which may be adopted* If full development is to the aim the extent of iminigration required must be considerable* A recent independent economic survey of Syria goes to show that the other districts which, next to the Jesireh, offer the best prospects for agricultural development in Syria are also short of arricultural labour and that only one district in the country is calculated to have an excess* The transfer to the Jezireh of the whole of such excess as may exist seems unlikely to be adequate to provide for the shortage in that district under an extensive rural development programme. Outside sources of labour will need to be considered. The present would appear to be an appropriate moment for Syria to determine its land colonisation policy, if it has not already done so* If it approves the entry of outside nationals in considerable numbers it should consider, and if possible decide in favour of, the settlement of Palestinian Arab refugees of the agricultural classes in its under-populated and agriculturally under-developed areas, particularly the Jezirsh* Every'- 6 - Sven under mechanised farming, for vhieh it ia particularly suitable, that territory could absorb many thousands of suitable people on the land. If it were decided, in addition, to reeenre a given *rea or a large tract for development on a peasant cultivator basis, the number that could be absorbed would be greatly increased. Road construction and the development of comnunlcations generally, the canalisation of areas to be newly brought under irrigation, the provision of domestic water requirements and other essential developmental operations also can provide work and will be a valuable asset in the agricultural off- season. 22,10.hd. ri.K.

Sir, BRITISH MIDI)Lb LAST OITI 10, SHARIA TCLUTBAT, CAIRO. # 15th February, 1949. 7 &lt;3 C V pie (°.t J ^ (x ^ P- I have the honour to transmit the following report on the work of the Development Divio Lon of the British Middle East Office during the last quarter of 1948. 2. General . i o &amp; As will be seen, much of the time of the Division was devoted to Persia and its Seven-Year Plan. This was considered necessary both for its own sake and in the interests of Anglo-American cooperation, since the Persisn Government had decided to call in Overseas Consultants, Incorporated, to set the plan in order. Sir Herbert Stewart and Dr. Murray both met and toured with the five members of the O.C.I. advance party. Relations were most cordial and the latter appeared to have a high opinion of the work done by members of the Development Division. It is, however, still uncertain whet part the Division will be called on to play in the Seven-Year Plan, whether in conjunction with O.C.I, or in the capacity of consultants to the Persian Government. The Head of the Supreme Planning Board has on more than one occasion said that he would be glad of the help of certain members of the Development Division c 3o Health. Dr. Pridie spent a fortnight in Ethiopia in order to renew contacts with the World Health Organisation body there. He also toured some part of the country and made a quick survey of health conditions in a section of the lake Tsana area. The usual never-ending quarantine difficulties between Egypt and the Sudan again took up much of his time and in this connection he spent a fortnight in the lattwr country. 4. Labour ■ e In October Mr. Audsley visited, at the request of the Iraq Petroleum Company, the Lebanon and Syria, to advisw on certain labour problems that had arisen. These included, among others, contractors, wages, hours of work and housing, and are for the most part the result of sudden industrial development in agricultural countries where labour laws are very often loosely drafted and where Governments seem to think that oil companies have unlimited funds. 5. Mr. Audsley has drawn attention to the seriousness of the housing shortage at Banias on the byrian coast, one of the termini of the pipe lines. The Iraq Petroleum Company are fully alive to this problem but it is hoped that they will be able to overcome it, for there is no doubt that lack of suitable housing is one of the most potent sources of labour unrest and is an easy target for agitators. The Right Honourable Ernest Bevin, M.P.- 2 - » 6* 1'rcm Tripoli Hr. Audsley was flown by the Iraq Petroleum Company to Kirkuk to advise on difficulties wnicr. had arisen over the Iraq Governments interpretation of a badly thoufht-out clause of the Labour Law, After consultation with the Company, ttr. Audsley saw the Dlrector- denertf^ of Labour, who eventually accepted his views and proposals for mod if leatIon. 7. while in Damascus Mr. Audsley was able to establish contact with the Presidents of the Transport ttorkers* ^nion of Damascus, the Federation of Labour in Northern Syria and Aleppo, and the Hailmayraens 1 Union of Aleppo, and with the Labour Editor of the newspaper 'Al Alam H , His talks with these Trades Union Leaders were of an introductory nature and were very friendly and encouraging. 8* Agriculture , Copies of Sir Herbert Stewart’s report on Syria were sent to Holf. Legation at Damascus for transmission to the Syrian Government. In this report sir Herbert Ltewart has drawn attention to the importance of the development of the Jezlrah, which would be of great benefit both to Syria and to world suoplies of grain and oil seeds. Development would be almost entirely in the rain-fed area and would thus not have to await the construction of large irrigation works. Much ecanomic and administrative planning is however necessary Both in Syria and afterwards in Persia, the information which Sir Herbert Stewart had collected in the United Kingdom with reference to the supply of tractors and agricultural Implements has been of great use. 9. At the end of October Sir Herbert Stewart went to Persia where he had further long discussions with the agricultural members of the Seven-Year Planning Board. H« also made a tour in central Persia with the advance party of the Overseas Consultants, Incorporated. 10. forestry and Soil Conservation , Mr. V.X. Maitland returned to Iraq for a short visit in September. There he was just In time to persuade the Government not to abolish the second post of British Forestry Bjcpert. Thanks to the cooperation of the Colonial Office, this post has now been filled. From Iraq he went to Persia, only to find, as so often happens In Middle iast countries, a new Minister who had to be convinced just as his predecessor had had to be. The lack of continuity caused by frequent Ministerial changes is one of the greatest difficulties which my advisers have to contend with. 11. Mr. V.K. Maitland wrote for the Persian Government an Improved draft for forestry legislation and drew up policies for forestry and pasturage. The carrying out of sucb policies in a country so large and backward as Persia bristles with political and administrative difficulties. Moreover, very considerable numbers of personnel will have to be trained, so that it does not seem possible for Persia to do other than tackle these problems area by area. i Mr. Maitland • • • •Ur.

In early Decef&lt;iber Mr * Maitland attended, as ai.i aember of the British delegation, the Madlterranaan Sub^. Commission of the P.A.O. - B.C.B. Forestry CommlaslOn atfi'. Kome, and helped to draft the report of working group No*l, dealing with Mediterranaan land uae. It cannot be too heavily emphasised that, with the exception of the forestry services of Cyprus, the Development Division is the only body in the Middle East which hae any real Idea of the needs of proper land use. It is for this reason Important, as I have pointed out in separate correspondence with the Foreign Office, that the Division should be represented at such conferences, at which, moreover, valuable contacts can be made with experts from other countries, such as Italy and France. 13. gtetlg,tj£fl A Dr. Murray was again in Persia in December, where he met the advance O.C.I. party and made with them a tour of tha North. They were much Impressed with the work which he had done. The question of his secondment for about a year to the Persian Government has now arisen, but nothing has yet been settled. After his return from Persia he went to Damascus where he drew up plans for a central statistical bureau. The statistical work of the Division has been badly thrown out of gear by the unexpected resignation, for family reasons, of an assistant who had only just arrived. 14. Entomologies. The Middle East Anti-Locust Unit was finally wound up in December end all surplus equipment and material handed over to the Desert Locust Survey or otherwise dlsoosed of. Mr. Stephenson, Director of the D.L.S., paid a visit to Cairo. It is quite obvious that Mr. Waters.ton will be necessary to the Survey for some time to come for liaison work with countries which the latter cannot at present touch. This office has already been able to help the Survey by obtaining for It permission to operate in Saudi Arabia and to cross over from there into the Yemen. Mr. Waterston visited Jedda with Mr. Stephenson to Introduce him to the local officials concerned with locust work. Relations with the Egyptian Anti-Locust Research Section continue to be very cordial end I am glad to reoort thet they have agreed to send a team to Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the Desert Locust Survey. What Is more, the Egyptian Government have made up their mind to abandon the proposal for an international locust convention to which we have been opposed from the start. The initiative in the Desert Locust world has now therefore passed once more to the United Kingdom.HKAI£1* ^ I returned froa Transjordan on October 2nd, 2, X visited Ethiopia for a fortnight in October, where I inspected the Princess Tsahai Memorial Hospital buildings and renewed my contacts with the Ministry of Health officials .and the Mtorld health Organization mission in Addis Ababa. I spent four c.ays in Gondar, where I visited bake Tsana, Gondar hospital snd rural dispensaries to assess public health conditions in this important area, particularly as regards aaiaris and bilherzla. I also visited Hessei and Debra 3ihan hospitals, and dispenseries in this areao 3 e For the rest of the time I was occupied with my duties as Health Counsellor in i*gypt, in the course of which I visited Alexandria to discuss quarantine questions and to keep in touch with the British staff at the Faculty of Medic ine„ 4- c 1 visited the Sudan for a fortnight in December, including Port Sudan, Khartoum rnd W; 2 di Haifa, to study laosquito control ond to discuss Yellow Fever and pilgrim quarantine problsms with the &amp;udan health authorities, Jnclucing the new Minister of healths (SGI) fi.D. fRIDIE c ✓mmzm X spent tht first three weeks of Octobwr in Cairo following up matters arising from ny earlier tour In i&gt;yrl* y and official work which I did when on leave e I also wade preparations for an extended visit to Persia* 2. Following np the general report which I wrote on agriculture In Syria, a special note was written end sent tc the Government of Syria, through the British Legation at Damascus, on the agricultural development of the Jazlrah In Syria. This Is one of the few agricultural areas of ,great magnitude in the Kiddle Cast w*ich can be developed for ralnfed farming. It has greet possibilities but its development should take place on a properly organised basis and not in the present haphazard manner. If properly undertaken on such a basis the area could not only bring increased prosperity to Syria but at minimum cost could make a substantial contribution to the food grain and oilseed scarcity now existing in the world in general. Tht area could also absorb surplus population from outside. Views on how develooment could be organised were put forward in the note. 3. A note was prepared and circulated to the various Middle East countries ir which the B.H.E.O. operates, on the latest developments in British tractors. Thera Is a great dearth of information In Missions In these countries and with the Governments concerned on the makes, types and specifications of the latest British tractors now being manufactured, and of their availability, prices, etc. During my leave 1 made personal contact with the manufacturers and from them collected and circulated information which should prove useful both to the countries concerned and to the commercial secretariats of the Missions concerned. 4. On October 24th I left for Tehran and returned to Cairo from Persia on December 7th. During a six weeks’ stay in that country X wade a tour of the northern region end studied agricultural conditions end possibilities and departmental organisations and facilities on the agricultural side. In and around Tehran I visited the various institutions and sections of the Agricultural Deourtment, studied their functions and organisation and formed cn opinion of their requirements. 5* Much time was spent with the agricultural members of the Supreme Planning Board in a study and discussions of the agricultural provisions and proposals in the Seven-Year Plan of economic development. The agricultural sections were examined individually end comments and suggestions were made on then. 6. Contact was made with the grouo of representatives of Overseas Consultants, Inc. soon after their arrival in Tehran from New York, This organisation had been employed by the Persian Government to advise and assist it in connection with the beven-Year Plan, end it sent a group of five representatives to Persia to establish personal touch with the Persian Government to get a general first hand Impression of Persian conditions, to advise on the feasibility of the Plan and regarding the next step to take in bringing the Plan to fruition. On the invitation of the group I accompanied them on a tour of central Persia, and during those days and subsequently until the group left Persia I had continuous contact with them. During sll these occasions agricultural conditions and possibilities were discussed; the group .... bIQ^yRy Mp The visit I made to Iraq on 29th September lasted till 3rd October• 1 was able to save the post of Assistant Forast Officer from beine surrendered by the Director General of Agriculture and to press for the secondment of Mr. Svans from the Colonial Service* That action has since resulted in Mr, isivans being sent to Iraq. 2 0 Some information was obtained on current economic developments and their relation to the presant state of agriculture in Iraq a Conversations were held with the two British officers now serving with the Ministry of Agriculture in that country. In view of Iraq’s shaky financial condition these facts were mentioned in a tour note end later at discussions at B.M.15.0. 3# I arrived in Iran on the 4th October and represented B.M.E.O. till relieved by Sir Herbert Stewart on the 25th. During my stay I improved the draft forest legislation which had been prepared after I left the country in June, 1948. In response to a request made by the Under-Secretary for Agriculture I prepared a suitable draft forest policy and a draft pasture policy for the country, which was embodied in the revised legislation for the Council of Ministers. As a new set of Ministers had been installed I had to begin all over again with persuasion regarding the need for forests and soil conservancy in the country. I had useful talks with some Seven-Year planners, mainly Dr. Naflcy. Dr. Adi and Mr. Fateh. I discussed with them £,M.£.0*s position vis a vis the American group of Overseas Consultants Inc. who were shortly to arrive in Persia. I had an interview with Prince Abdul Kesa and discussed a wide variety of subjects, with emphasis on the Seven-Year Plan and forestry. Fxon the Seven-Year planners • and from Prince Abdul Reza I received assurances that British experts would be required in the Seven-fear Plan execution. In such ways I prepared the ground for the subsequent visit of Sir Herbert Stewart and Dr. Murray, which was timed to coincide with the arrival of Overseas Consultants Inc. The report which I had previously written on forestry in Persia, which was embodied in a . resort sent by the American Embassy Tehran to Washington had, it appears, convinced the Americans that the whole of the agricultural Seven-Year Plan required re-cesting. 4 C I was able to ret the Persians interested in Colonel Wright’s aerial rurvay proposals (Hunting Aero Surveys Ltn.). I understand that Col. bright has made guod progress as a result cvf the contacts which I assisted him to obtain. As regards timber exploitation, it was judged toe aarly to make any recommendations to the Persians, be are still at the planning ard no!icy level. Dr. Uaflcy, at the and of my stay, enquired from me whether it would be possible to go to Persia for six months at least to assist with the planning and I gave him to understand that I would endeavour to do so. I also undertook to assist in the recruitment of suitable British officers when pests were available*5. The organisation of a Forest Service and possibly a Pasture Service in this vast country is a big Job involving execution of large scale field operations of surveying, delimitation and so forth. It involves training of a large number of subordinates and is altogether a muc^ bigger operation than the setting up of Bureaux o~ Advisory Services. Phase two and particularly Phase three in these subjects will require very careful guidance on account of the political repercussions of restrictive measures• 6* On account of the delay in the arrival of Overseas Consultants Inc. I w^s unable to be present in Tehran when they arrived» My place was taken by Sir Herbert Stewart who reached Tehran the day I left. Cn my arrival in Cairo I conveyed a message from the Ambassador, in Tehran to Sir John Troutbeck regarding changing Dr. Murray*s plans to allow him to go to Tehran and assist with the visit of Overseas Consultants, in view of his having spent a considerable time in Persia Just previously and having established a reasonable claim to the organisation of statistics in the beven-^ear plan. I conveyed as requested the latest views of the Ambassador on this and other subjects to Sir John Troutbeck. In &lt; consequence of his ready. agreement the necessary changes in the programme were made and Murray was sent to Tehran on the 15th. 7* I remained in Cairo till 11th December and was busy with office work of various kinds. Notes were written on my tour and on other subjects, and arrears of correspondence dealt with. A Circular letter tc Middle Hast countries regarding their sending forestry students to Edinburgh University was sent round. The authorities in byria and Iraq are attempting to get their Governments to take action. A further letter from Professor Stabbing (Edinburgh University) was received offering support and urging early reservation of seats. 8„ On the 11th December X left for Home to attend the Mediterranean Sub-Commission of the PAG/RCh Forestry Commission as part of the U.K. Delegation. With Mr. Cameron of FAO/ECE, who had arrived from Geneva, I drafted the report of Working Group Mo. 1 which dealt with flediterranem Land Use policy ^nd which made recommendations for action to be taken by F.A.G, My attendahce at this meeting served a Useful purpose for various reasons which have been mentioned in the separate report which has been written or the subject.

The Desert Locust Survey vas eel up on October 1st and Mr. P.fi. Stephenson, Its Director, visited Cairo from Kove/aber 22nd to 24th to discuss aattars of organisation with me. Subsequently I visited Jedda fron December 12th to l8tb to Introduce Ur. Stephenson to Oovernnent officials there and to discuss the work of the Arabian tean with field officers on the spot. 3o Since the Desert Locust Survey caae Into belne I have been concerned with liaison between the Survey and othar organisations. The Desert Locust Survey has obtained permission to operate in Saudi Arabia and the Yemen Government has agreed to the entry of a reconnaissance unit from the ‘tiharna* of Saudi Arabia. This is a great advance In the attempts started by the Middle East Anti- Locust Unit to accustom the Yemenis to anti-locust work and the opening of the frontier near MiJi to locust detachments will greatly facilitate and speed up the survey of suspected outbreak areas along the Eastern Led Sea coast. 4 e Liaison with the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture has been continued at a friendly technical level and the Under Secretary of State for Agriculture has encouraged direct a oprcaches to him and his Entomologists on technical matters. The Egyptian Government has agreed to send a snail unit to cooperate with the Desert Locust Burvey in the 1 tIhama ' of Hajaz and 'Asir and some equipment (trucks and spares) has been set aside from the disposal of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit for use by the Egyptian team. 5. Mahommed Hussein Bey, Head of the Locust Research jection in the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture, returned to Cairo in December after spending nearly two months visiting the Anti-Locust Research Centre'in London and various research institutions in France, Denmark snd Italy. It will be recalled that I instituted the proposal for the visit of Meboomed Hussein 3ey to London. There have already been imoortant developments following this visit. The Egyptian Government has decided to drop the controversial Draft International Desert Locust Convention and to cooperate with us in arable as well as to carry out fundamental research on locusts at Bokki. 6c The Government of Pakistan has decided to send an Anti-Locust Mission to the Oman, at the request of the United Kingdom. 1 have riven advice to the Locust Control Organisation, Pakistan, regardlne the suspected outbreak areas of the Oman.t Th#r« it good rtMon for iattaff0,110/1 utth what ha«:&gt;bon aocoTipllahad during tl?e quartfr# f Brltlah tnttlattva In •ntl^locuat work haa bean maintained by the setting up the naaart ^ocaat Burvey and this, with wupromlsed Eayptian coop-ration, will enable aost of the auabeqted.outbreak rr^ga cf the Desert Locust in the Red Sea area to come under supervision* It la underatood that the Covernment of the Anrlo4&amp;eyptian Sudan has under cons ideret^ion plana for mounting regions of&gt; the Sudan. antl-loouat teem in the coastel ' ^ 'I * ' 1: 1 ' 1 jj At the Tehran Locust Conference, Iran undartook to survey the Mekran for outbreak areas, Pakistan undartook tol maintain its existing supervision of the t outcreak araaa of ^ Boluchiatan-Mekran and send a mission to Oman, Indie agreed' tofmaintain, its watch on locust breeding in Sind-Rajputana ^andoalso to carry out resaarch.

Pending receipt v ~ ie bailed estimates, a rou^h estinmtfi ri-p /-» 4 - • is £1 million . S estimate of the cost involved V) Possi ble long—tertn 'projects : (i) Mr. M.G. lonides, formerly Development Office to the Government of Transjordan, carried out an irrigation survey of the country in 19do and recommended that a major irriVtinn project, based on the Waters ofkhe Jofda^ that^cn4P ractica ble. He estimated that cout at 1938 prices to be £ 2 , 650 . 000 . Io is considered that this project could provide for 100,000 settlers in four or 1 . 1 '/e years time from the date of its inception. Before any action can be taken by Transjordan on this project, however,-7- it wilt, be necessary for her first to reach an agreement with the G-overnment of Israel regarding the use of the waters of these rivers, for since the Israeli frontier runs for some distance down the centres of the rivers the waters belong equally to both States. Meanwhile, the Transjordan Government have announced their intention of carrying out a hydrographical and ground survey of ^the project which would enable detailed designs of the works to be prepared and estimates of the cost to be drawn up. They have accordingly asked the Crown Agents for the Colonies to recommend them a firm of British engineers to undertake this survey, and they are understood to have set aside £ 5,000 to cover its cost. R ec ommendation The Crown Agents should be advised to meet this request as urgently as possible. (ii) Meat Canning Factorv; lief ore the disastrous drought of i 9^4-7 » Transiordan had a considerable export surplus of sheep, and if the project for constructing water-holes referred to at paragraph 2 (a)(ii &gt; ) above is undertaken it should be possible to restore this surplus with reasonable speed. The possibilities of improving the quality of the pasturage in Transjordan might also usefully be investigated by the Forestry and Soil Conservation Adviser to the B.M.E.O. It is understood that a meat canning factory in the Middle East could be a paying proposition if a through-put of 40,000 animals per annum were attained. This figure is considered to be beyond the capacity of Transjordan alone but the B•M*E♦ 0 . have suggested that a meat canning facirory might be set up at Damascus which would draw on supplies of sheep from oyria ana northern Iraq, as well as from Transjordan. Recommendation (1) The Overseas Food Corporation should be invited to consider undertaking this project with a view to importing the meat into tne United Kingdom, and, as a first step,'to send an expert to the Middle East to make a detailed survey. .( 2) The Forestry and Soil Conservation Adviser to B.M.E.O. and the Animal Husbandry Adviser (when appointed) should nav * prolonged visits to^Transjordan to advise on improvement of pasturage, livestock breeding and animal disease control, etc. (iii) Agricultural Development : A considerable market exists in the Levant States and Israel for cereals, grapes, olives and olive oil and vegetables produced in Transjordan. It is likely that there are numerous small ways in which Transjordan could be assisted to expand her production of those crops.Re oommendation The Agricultural Adviser to the 3*M#E»0* should make a survey of Transjordan to advise on the technical measures required to promote the development of agricultural production* (iv) F isheries : It is considered that the fisheries at Aqaba could be considerably expanded if road communications between Amman and Aqaba could be improved (see 2 (a) (iv) above). An expanding market for this fish at present exists in Transjordan itself and in Israel. Certain small capital expenditure on the provision of a collecting ship and_refrigerated lorries might be required. It is considered likely that Transjordan could provide this herself. R ecomm enda tion We should suggest to the Transjordan G-overnment that they shall draw up plans for the development of the Aqaba fisheries, and offer to assist them with technical advice. (v) Phosphates ; An Italian concern has recently negotiated an agreement with the Transjorgan Government to form a Company, with the participation of Transjordan interests, for the development of the extensive phosphate deposits which exist in the country. It is understood that the Italians propose to market these phosphates in Italy and in other Middle East countries. They are now negotiating with the Lebanese Government for permission to establish a super phosphate plant at Beirut with a capacity of 20,000 tons p.a. The Lebanese Government are anxious for the contract for this plant to be awarded to a British firm, and the Board of Trade are now considering this proposal* In order to develop the deposits to their full capacity, which could provide for an export of 1 , 200,000 tons per annum, it is estimated that capital expenditure on mining and transport equipment amounting to £h million will be required. There is considered to be very little likelihood that the Italians are at present contemplating development on this scale, since a wider market for these phosphates does not yet exist. From a long-term point 'of view, however, there may prove to be a demand for Transjordan phosphates in East Africa, Persia, India and Pakistan as economic development schemes in these areas gradually mature. R e c omme nd atio n (1) If a British firm proves willing to undertake the contract for the erection of a super phosphate factory at Beirut we should agree to the necessary transfer of capital and provision of equipment. (2) We should watch closely for the possibility of wider markets opening up for Transjordan phosphates and if necessary consider at a later stage the provision of assistance, either in the form of a loan or of capital equipment, to Transjordan in order to make possible the full development of the phosphate deposits.(0) GKHERA1 ' Uembershiij of the I ntern ational Bank: Transjordan is not at present a member of the International Bank.

Transjordan is likely to come out of the Palestine settlement v/ith a considerably increased area and population, having acquired the central part of Arab Palestine. The resident population will be raised from some 400,000 to some 800,000. There are also about 300,000 Arab refugees in Transjordan and what is now ■Arab Palestine and this number may be increased by the addition of refugees moving in from the Lebanon and Syria. A large proportion of these are women and children, Transjordan has show n itself the most reasonable of the Arab States in the Palestine question, the best organised militarily and socially the most cohesive. The alliance v/ith His Majesty’s Government is a corner stone of Transjordan policy. It is in H.M.G’s military and political interest that the greater Transjordan should become a viable state with a rising standard of living and in close relations with H.M.G. The United Nations are providing for the short-term maintenance of Arab refugees but there is no internat ional scheme for their re-settlement. This will have to be treated country by- country. By far the heaviest weight falls on Transjordan. The re-settlement of these' refugees is a pressing humanitarian task and any contrib ution which H.M.G. can make .to it will produce rich political dividends. The present financial situation of Transjordan is precarious. The budget is more or less in balance at a very low figure. External payments are only balanced as a result of H.M.G’s subsidy for the Arab Legion amounting for 1949/50 to a total of £ 3i million and by means of the temporary expedient of obtaining (with H.M.G’s permission) by the sterling obtained from the redemption of Palestine currency notes imported from Syria and the Lebanon and brought in by refugee's., This expedient cannot last longer than.about the end of this year at the most. Transjordan’s ability to pay for imports^ with exports has been gravely reduced by the refugees who have consumed what is normally the exportable surplus of commodities,. It was thought some time ago that a general subsidy and rehabilitation grant from external sources would have to be provided if the administration of Greater Transjordan was to get^going at all. H.M. Minister at Amman now advises that this is not at present nece.ssary and that while stealing is available from the redemption of Palestine currency notes, Transjordan can support■itself provided that the burden of providing for refugees is lifted, and that the subsidy for the Arab Legion is maintained at its present figure. While it is a direct British strategic interest that the Arab Legion should be maintained as an effective course,- 2 - it is in many ways undesirable that this should- be done by means of continuing payments by H.M.G. for this speciiic^purpose. It would be much better if even at greater initial-expense to the general economic situation of Transjordan could be improved to such an extent that the country could pay for- its own army. The essential requirements of the situation therefore are:- (a^ Provision must be made in order that the refugees should not constitute a burden on the Transjordan Government after the end of the present short-term United Nations relief. This can be done by enabling Transjordan to re-settle permanently as many refugees as possible by attempting to secure a^prolongation of United Nations relief on a diminishing scale until re-settlement is completed. (b) The general economic level and the capacity to export must be raised to a sufficient extent so that Transjordan can hove a satisfactory balance of payments after refunds of Palestine currency have come to an end. balance 01 payments should not be considered as finally satisfactory until Transjordan can dispense with the Arab Legion subsidy from H.M.G, Recommendations. The three requirements noted above can best be met by a co-ordinated policy of short-term and long-term economic development assisted by H.M.G. and possibly for the longer-term schemes by the International Bank. Assistance from H.M.G. is an essential part of s ruM.o- s whole Middle East policy. It must be judged on the principle of the necessity of putting Transjordan on its feet, not from the point of view of getting the best POosible immediate return for our money. Moreover in the re-settlement schemes, the objective must be to re settle the greatest possible number of people* If this means that for a time at any rate, no surplus is produced to provide a return on the money invested, this should not be regarded as an obstacle but as evidence that the scheme is designed with the above object in view. ■ The choice^is not between different schemes with varying economic advantages, but between investment wdthout immediate return in the schemes oi development noted below and a free gift. A summary of the detailed recommendations is as follows:- (l) H.M.G. should immediately moke an interest-free loan to the Transjordan Government.of £ 1 million for the feS S ?hS f .? arrying out the sraa11 irrigation schemes the streams running into the Jordan tha settlemont on ram-fed land near MaVn a£cl the areas™ ° n ° f Wator - holes in eastern desert( 2 ) H.M.G. should make a grant of £ 1 million to the Transjordan Government for the improvement of road communications between Amman and Aqaba and the maintenance of the Transjordan section of the Haifa-Bagdad road. (This is not recommended to be d loan as this work is required very largely for military purposes and can never be directly productive.) ( 3 ) is soon as a survey has been made of the larger irrigation schemes dependent on the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers, we should decide whether British financial assistance can be provided or whether Transjordan Government should be advised to apply to the International Bank. (4) The Overseas Pood Corporation should examine a proposal for a meat canning factory to be supplied by sheep production in Trans'jordan and neighbour ing territories. (5) Wo should explore further the possibility of British commercial participation in the develop ment and processing of Transjordan phosphates.' If there is such participation the necessary facilitius for transfer of funds, etc. up to a reasonable amount should be allowed. ( 6 ) The Transjordan Government should be urged to join the International Bank and H.M.G. should provide the' gold deposit of £ which will ‘be required in the form of an interest-free loan to the Transjordan Government. (7) •We should give all possible technical help to the Transjordan Government through the British Middle East Office and in other v/ays, and we should encourage the Government to appoint a British development commissioner. Discussion The Economic Develonment of Greater Transjordan The State of Greater Transjordan - i*e. Transjordan plus Arab Palestine - is now a political fact. Its boundaries on the western side have not, of course, yet been agreed, but it may be estimated that the population of the new State will amount to about 800,000 excluding the 300,000 refugees who are at present established in it. To ensure the stability and prosperity of this new State must be for some time to come a cardinal factor of our foreign policy in the Middle East. The aim of this paper is, therefore, to examine (i) the present situation; (ii) the possibilities of economic development and (iii) the extent and form of such further assistance as it may be essential for His Majesty’s Government' to provide in order to establish the State of Greater Transjordan on a sound economic basis.-4- I.

As regards (a), however, we are anxious to nromote -ubsirne^to^th^A 11 'wii 1 be possible, to discontinue direct ou bi^ieo to the Arab region. Investment in the economic development of Transjordan should be a means of removing this eemrent burden irom his Majesty r s Government. As regards (b), it is now generally agreed that only a small proportion of the refugees m Greater Transjordan are likely to be accented back at their homes by. the Government of Israel or in fact to wish to return It is, therefore, desirable that olans ?or be settlement should be worked out as soon as possible The Transjordan Government are understood to be vailing in'principle to absorb these refugees into Transjordan and to be now-tmlvin? this question. The United Nations relief for the maintenant 8 of \ tho refugees is unlikely to last beyond the end of this vear and we cannot yet anticipate what assistance, if any the United’ Natrons arc likely to give towards the question of LseUlement.'1° should, therefore, encourage the Transjordan Government op assume responsibility for the re-settlement of as 'many of ohese refugees as possible, and this factor will have to be taken into account when assessing the assistance which we should give to Transjordan, If financial assistance for re-settlement from U,N. sources subsequently materialises, sc much the better. As regards (c), this source of sterling exchange must be considered a windfall which will not last at longest for more than six to eight months. Apart, therefore, from the factors discussed at (a) and^(b) above, tne question of providing a further source of sterling income xor Greater Transjordan now requires urgent consideration, 11 • THE POSSIBILITIES OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMEM 1 It may be recalled that the Transjordan Finance when he visited this country at the end of last year, the question of a possible development loan with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

(M.R. right)CONFIDENTIAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE EAST (Memorandum by the Foreign Office) 1, Economic and social development in the Middle East is an important factor in promoting the stability of an area which is of great strategic and economic interest to the United Kingdom. The Arab countries are economically and socially backward but many of them have great potential wealth. In particular very large sums will be available from the development of oil resources in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Food production for export can be increased in Egypt, Syria and Iraq. This wealth ought not to benefit privileged and corrupt ruling classes only but should be used to raise the standard of living of the population. The amounts of sterling so accruing to Middle East countries may prove a serious embarrassment to us unless ways of spending it to the satisfaction of the holders can be developed, 2, The difficulties of promoting development are very great. The countries concerned are not only foreign countries, but Eastern countries. A mixture of patience and understanding with relentless pressure will be required if much is to be achieved. Yet we must'not be satisfied with less than achievement, for the alternative would be the acceptance of conditions in the Middle East likely to lead to chaos, revolution and communism, and the abandonment of the hope of important contributions to the increase in world food production and to British and European recovery. Both because it is in our own interest, and also because American and Soviet policy over Palestine has at least for the time being left Britain as the only Pov/er in whom Middle East countries still have confidence, it is right that His Majesty*s Government should play a leading part in planning the work to be undertaken. This planning must, of course, take place on the basis that the Arab States themselves are the senior partners in a joint enterprise. The primary responsibility rests, and must continue to rest, with them. Our aim is indeed to stimulate an increased realisation of this responsibility. 3, The Cabinet decided on 27th November 1945 (C.P.(45) 304) to set up a Middle East Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of^the Foreign Secretary and a Middle East (Official) Committee under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State, to consider Middle East questions affecting more than one Department. The purpose of this decision was largelv to co-ordinate the various departmental interests in plans for the development of the economic resources in the Middle East which it was hoped to pursue without delay and to ensure that these problems were dealt with on a regional basis 4# In fact, the Middle East Committee of Minister has never met. The Middle East (Official) Committee met once in 1945 , once m 1946 , five times in 1947 and once, on 31 st December, m 1948. The inactivity of these Committees has d + e t0 the . f ? ct that owiri g to the pre-occupation of Middle eastern countries with Palestine, it has been impossible to make much progress with schemes of development Such preparatory work as was practicable has meanwhile been pursued/fl 6./ pursued 'by the Government Departments concerned and by B • M. E. 0 • 5# Now that a settlement in Palestine is nearer, it i to be hoped that real progress may at last be possible in putting into practice some of the development plans which have been made or considered, particularly as regards the Nile Waters, irrigation in Iraq, agricultural development in Syria, the Seven Year Plan in Persia and various development schemes in Transjordan. 6. President Truman, in his Inaugural Address on 20th January, referred particularly to the interest of the United States Government in extending technical and other assistance to under-developed areas; and the Foreign Secretary took up this passage in a speech to Foreign Press Association, promising the full cooperation of His Majesty*s Government. A Cabinet paper is being circulated describing the new Committee structure which has now been approved in order to provide for the coordination and supervision of British policy on this important subject. These arrangements provide for the reconstitution of the M.E,(0.) C., reconstituted at a lower level with an Assistant Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office in the chair. The Committee’s revised terms of reference will be circulated very shortly. 7. It is recommended that the M.E.(0).C. should set up an inter-departmental working party under Foreign Office chairmanship. The working party should consist of representatives of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Board of Trade, and Central.Economic and Planning Staff, and representatives of ether departments concerned with particular subjects under discussion; in particular, the Ministries of Food, Fuel and Power and Transport, The terms of reference should be: (a) To study: (i) the possibilities of economic development throughout the Middle East; that is, Persia and the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant States, the Nile Basin from Egypt to Ethiopia, and the former Italian Colonies; (ii) the scope for British technical, economic and financial participation in the preparation and execution of plans for such development, bearing in mind the necessity for co-ordinating, through the appropriate Government committees, etc. the possible calls on our productive and manpower resources arising from those plans with the calls arising elsewhere, especially in the Colonies; (iii) 'the scope for participation of the United Nations, International Bank and the United States. (b) To make recommendations whenever appropriate on the above subjects for submission to the Middle East (Official) Committee and, if necessary, to the Economic Development Committee,\ \ t ' 11./ 8* The Working Party would be instructed, among its first tasks under the above terms of reference to consider — (a) all existing plans for development and to make recommendations on their order of priority and method of execution. Attention should particularly be given to the importance of starting certain small pilot projects which have high publicity value. (*&gt;) whether the time has now come for an extension of the work of the B.M.S.O. technicians^ Their function at present is to present advice to foreign Governments on request. Our suggestion put forward foi* consideration is that they-or some new body should now concern themselves more directly with the preparation and execution of plans for development, i.e. should act more in the capacity of industrial and financial consultants; (c) the implementation of the plans for Anglo-American economic co-operation in the Middle East which were discussed in November 1947» which have not yet been put fully into effect owing to disturbed conditions. (See M.E.(0.).(47)28 of 11th November 1947). (d) to what extent the productive resources of other participants in O.E.E.C. could be made available against payment in sterling likely to accrue to Middle East countries in increasing amounts as oil production develops. Discussion 9. There are various developments which will greatly influence the prospects of economic development in the Middle East in the near future. As stated above it is hoped that before the end of this year Middle East states may themselves be willing to pay more attention to the subject. We have also to consider, with particular reference to the Anglo-American discussions referred to in paragraph 8(c) above, the impact of President Truman’s proposal to use American technical resources to help in the development of backward areas and we have to take into account the large American investments taking place and likely to take place in Israel with the pronounced possibility that the American Government may be thinking of using the Israelis as their agents for the economic development of the Middle East. 10. Among the major problems is the difficulty of persuading the Middle East Governments to take the necessary decisions. They have got to be induced to reform their internal administration, and particularly their financial administration. They must themselves be able to provide the necessary internal finances and local manpower of the necessary competence, and internal conditions must be sufficiently stable to allow of continuity in carrying out major development works. Progress in this direction can only be obtained by the steady exercise of our influence through diplomatic channels and by the advice of British bankers and friends in whom the local governments already have a large measure of confidence.* l ! 11. The present organisation of the B.M.E.O.* has produced extremely useful results in winning the confidence of the Governments for British technical help. But we have nov^ probably got as far as we can in preparing the ground a^ general background planning. What is required is the drawing up of concret.e schemes and their execution. It will be for consideration whether in addition to, or instead of, some of the present organisation of the B.M.S.O. we ought not to have a group of men more closely connected with industry in this country who would be able to make or cause to be made, definite detailed plans for particular schemes of development which would form the basis for tenders from industrial firms. It would have to be borne in mind that much of B.M.E.O. ! s. most useful work is related to social conditions and reform and the social implications of economic development. An industrial group could not properly take over these functions. «a] ■'I vl’ Jear Jo oistca, You orato to 3;/ers on lath 1 -arcJ i about tlxe position of certain Official Conalttees.

You are attending the meeting on 25th March' on my behalf (representing both sides of the C.R. 0. ).; I would be grateful if you could show the attached paper to Mr.J.Thomson, Mr. Cuaming-Bruce, Mr. Walsh-Atkins and Mr. Costar. Subject to any views which you or any of them may have, I am inclined to think that it is unnecessary for us to have any representative at all on the proposed Working Party. If any questions arise in respect of which consultation with other Commonwealth Governments seems necessary, that point can be picked up when the Working Party reports to the main Middle East Official Committee or to the Economic Development Committee. 'R.V It is^howeVLv, for consideration whether arrangements should not be made under which copies of papers circulated to the Working Party come to somebody in the C.R.O., so that we can watch what is going on. I am, however, doubtful whether even this is necessary. Already too much paper comes our way. 23.3.49.

As you will see the Middle aast (Official) Committee has been discussing a paper about the United Kingdom's attitude to development in Middle ciast countries. Paradoxically the result is. that, it is proposed that H.M.G. should take a more dynuiuic line with regard to development in this arsa than we are, in. general, able lo take with Commonwealth countries. So lar as the C.R.O. is concerned the main points, which were discussed with Mr, Fowler beiore the meeting, are:- (a) ' That any pxoposal to aki.ke U.K. Goverrment grants or loans towards development in these areas must be considered in the light of our policy with regard to, and our estimate oi requirements in, Colonial and Commonwealth countries, (b) That we must keep a close eye on any functions which may be delegated to tbe specialised agencies of U.N.O. as a result of proposals now being considered for the administration of funds available under the r-wwt Point Programme. rawvw (c) That, whatever other proposals may be put forward, direct executive responsibility for Middle dast development schemes must still remain with the Governments concerned. 3. I do no us to attend tomorrow. think it will be necessary lor Sflurther meeting on this point had a word with Miss Waterlow /about 8MI0Pabout the previous meeting and it is ciear that our interest is well recognised in the Foreign Office. Mr. Fowler will refer to us aqy further points of doubt on which he needs advice. The subject is one oi very great general interest u&gt; which, at a later stage, we may be able to contribute.I attended the second meeting of the reconstituted Middle East (Official) Committee on 5iih. May# I proposed the following amendment to the new paragraph 4 at the bottom of page 2 of the enclosure to ME *0* *49* 9 'Revised ,, dated 2nd May at paper ZCf i- After the word 'especially'' insert 'the other countries of the Commonwealth in respect of which we have special obligations and'. This was agreed to by the Committee# I have considered whether we should raise the question of informing Commonwealth Governments and/or High Commissioners about the work of the ME fo) *C l . Middle East CommitThe Committee is only just at the stage of preparing its initial proposals for the information and approval of the Economic Development Committee and it seems a bit early to send out any information about its activities# In any case there is a Commonwealth Economic Planning Committee subordinate to the Economic Development Committee and until I have been able to find out a little more about its activities and whether anything has yet been said about it to High Commissioners and Commonwealth Governments I think we had better leave over the question of sending out information about the MEOC# This point about the Commonwealth Economic Planning Cconittee is the only one we need pursue at the moment# Ilf Ur 'Zc/'&amp;fcz. 4*5 1 ^ s'i) //. - — Tne enclosure to (77) is a useful piece of research and the facts in it might be of interest to other Commonwealth Governments who have not the facilities for gathering this information for themselves. I would spggest, therefore, that \a&gt; t-. P\ we send copies of the enclosure to (77) to our High Commissioners -fiSdr all the Member^ ybf the Commonwealth, explaining that it is a note by U.K. officials and might be passed on to Commonwealth Governments for their confidential information. I think it would be useful also if the document at (85) could be sent to our High Commissioners in India and Pakistan £ X f° r their own secret information. The covering document would ^ j ' have to be reworded to avoid reference to specific U.K. Government committees and we would, of course, have to explain to our High Commissioners that the proposals set out in the document have beai approved only at the official level and have yet to be considered by Ministers in conjunction with other development proposals for other parts of the world. Sir L. G-rafftey-Smith may have seen the document at (85) since he attended some of the meetings of the Conference of Middle East representatives in London, but it will also be of interest to his staff. would you please let me know if you agree. I would propose to obtain the concuri-ence of the Secretary of the Middle East Canmittee to the proposal^ above. Perhaps you would refer the file to Miss .Vardale as regards (77). It may be that we ought simultaneously to consult the Ministry of Fuel ) / and Power about that one. W C-rd-oA*- . ft- a. X i „ Oc^U- A ^ I ^ GU-rv u—v—^ „Mr. Maclennan The Middle E a st (Official) Committee send two copies of their papers to the C.R.O. (they are at present addressed to Mr. Rumbold). One copy goes to Mr. Thomson and the other is attached to this file. The South Asian Department is the Department which has hitherto been regarded as primarily responsible for the C.R.O. relations with the M.E.(o) Committee. (See Mr. Rumbold's minute of 23 rd March). It is not altogether clear to me why this arrangement was originally made, but I believe that it was thought that the Committee would be specially concerned with development schemes which would be of interest to India and Pakistan and which would be in competition for help from this country with development schemes in India and Pakistan. This Department was thought to be in the best position to assess the interests of the Governments of India and Pakistan in these matters. This may have been the case at one time, but I do not think that it is any longer. The South Asian Department has only a superficial day to day contact with econanic developments in India and Pakistan. 7/e are seldom in a position to comment on the substance of the Committee papers and)since the papers of the other development committees parallel ^tbh the ,M.E. (0) Committee (the Far East^Commonwealth and Colonial (Official) Development Committees) and the papers of the Econanic Development Committee (Overseas), the Body to which the M.E.( 0 ) Canmittee reports^ are all dealt with by Economicit!b-f^ve are not even in a position to judge if and when the vast amount of research material produced by the M.E.( 0 ) Committee should be given to our High Commissioners or other Commonwealth Governments. I think, therefore, that we should consider asking the Economicl^D-^c.,to take over these papers, refeq^hem to the appropriate Department of the Foreign Affairs Division when matters of special political interest arise (in most cases, under our present division of workj the Foreign .-ffairs Department concerned will be the &gt;H«stern and U.N. Department) ■alt-hough The South Asian Department should of course -like ■■■t-cr continue to see papers about territories in which we are especially concerned, e. g., the Persian Gulf States, about which a paper is apparently to be circulatecfflSy the ,/orking Party of the M.E. (0) Committee. (See Agenda attached on top of Pol.Ext. 5V 2 ). My remarks above about the M.E.(o) papers apply also to the papers of its forking Party on Pol.Ext. 5^/2. ,e have never sent representatives to the forking Party. It simply produces papers which in due course appear as M.E.( 0 ) papers. JUs iL; Ua-w * ^-JLLxJL vJ jhvvC tk, X. ra , Litk™ ~ J 1* ' i b L » /!'/(• i. In considering this question it may be useful to set down the Committee structure which deals 'with the various questions of overseas economic development. 2. At the peak of the pyramid there is the Economic Policy Committee of the Cabinet. To this Committee there reports the Economic Development (Overseas) Committee, the Chairman of which is Sir Edwin Plowden, The Chief Planner, and the Permanent Under secretaries of State are the departmental IV (Vw /representativesrepresentatives on this Committee. To the E.D. (O.S.) Committee there reports four Committees. (i) The Committee on Colonial Economic Development, which deals, as its name implies, with economic development in the Colonies. (ii) The Commonwealth Economic Development Committee, which deals with the countries for which C.R.O. is responsible. (iii) The Middle East (Official) Committee, which deals with economic developnent in the Middle East countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, the Sudan and the former Italian Colonies in Africa. (iv) The Far East (Official) Committee, which deals with economic development in the Far East and South East aSia. 3. Unlike the first two Committees which deal exclusively with economic affairs, the Middle East (Official) Committee and the Far East (Official) Committee^also deal with other matters, e.g. political affairs. It was on this ground, I think, that membership of the Middle East (Official) Committee remained with Mr. Rumbold and a special arrangement for a duplicate set of papers coming to Economic IV Department took care of the immediate task of a report on economic development in the Middle East with which the Committee was charged. This report has now been completed. The Middle East (Official) Committee has sent in its work to the Economic Development (Overseas) Committee who has in turn reported to the Cabinet in an E.P.C. paper. The economic work of the Middle East (Official) Committee,for the time being at any rate, is over. 4. In the circumstances which I have set out it is for consideration whether it would be wise at this juncture to make any diange in the arrangements for representation on the Middle East (Official) Committee in the sense of transferring representation to the economic as distinct from the political side of the Office. I should have thought in all probability it will be the political side of /theJ 4 ~'*' f C'Vw. ‘‘' 1“ 1^ CM^j- °ff— U-4.

Although it was not possible to be very forthcoming in reply to the Pakistan request for information about development projects in the Middle East for background during the Pan-Islamic Economic Conference, I think we should reconsider now the question of making available to the Pakistan and Indian Governments some of the material which has been collected by the Middle East Official Committee o^ Economic Development projects in the Middle East, This is something which I have had in mind in connection with the papers on this file, but it is difficult to assess what material should and should not go to other Commonwealth Governments when one is dealing in isolation with the work of the Middle East Official Committee and not with the work of the Committee to which it reports. In any case, insofar as the researches of the Middle East Committee have so fax been almost purely economic, the question is really one for your Department, So far, all I have done in this connection is to send copies of the report about oil resources at (77) to our High Commissioners in all the Commonwealth countries with a suggestion that it should be passed on to Governments, You may wish to consider what information about Middle East development projects could suitably and usefully be passed on to | other Commonwealth countries. You will know, for example, to what extent it would be wise to inform the other Hpnibers ^ofMjhe Commonwealth of the United Kingdom policy as expressed injpaper at( 85 ) on this file.
