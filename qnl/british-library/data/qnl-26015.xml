Repeated to Foreign New Delhi 10th Army No. 71 Saving Minister of State. IIIPORTAM T. Purchased American trucks for Russia assembled by United Kingdom Commercial Corporation at Busihre have hitherto been driven to Tehran by local drivers employed by United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and handed over here to American Military Mission who after inspection have handed them over to the Russians. This procedure was adopted in spite of the desire of the Russian authorities to send their ov/n drivers to take over in Bushire, because of the objection which Government of India and, I believe, the 10th Army to have, to Russian penetration in the South. His Majesty’s Legation and United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have however received continual complaints of serious damage and pilferage suffered by these trucks on the way from Bushire to Tehran and Tehran representative of United Kingdom Commercial Corporation considers that the only satisfactory course is to allow Russian drivers to take over at Bushire, provided that they do not interfere with assembly and merely take deliveries from Americans who would receive the trucks fromjUnited Kingdom Commercial Corporation as soon as assembled. I agree with this entirely and recommend this proposed procedure be adopted immediately. Degree of Russian penetration will eventually be determined by world situation after the war, not by number of Russians who visit the South now, v/hile it is essential that the Russians should have no cause to complain that but for our obstruction they might have received their trucks more quickly and in better condition. I shall be glad to receive instructions immediately. 2. I have just received from Soviet Ambassador very long list of defects and shortage. I should like to put an end to this friction as soon as possible. [Copies sent to Mr. Armst CslWCP.tf uO-O. POL.
