The pectoral is in the shape of a shrine with battered sides and cavetto cornice. The obverse is decorated in the following manner: At the top there is a winged sun-disk. Below this there is a representation of a boat with curved prow and stern. On the center of the boat is a large scarab pushing before (i.e. above) itself a sun-disk, and flanked by the goddesses Isis (to the right) and Nephthys (to the left) who hold their arms up in adoration. The boat rests upon a strip of \"water\" marked with chevron shapes executed in incised lines. The entire scene is framed on the top and sides by a bank within which runs a narrower band which is broken up into a series of single large rectangles alternating with a number of smaller rectangles. The bottom of the scene is framed  by a broad band within which there is a floral motif executed by means of inlaid pieces of glass (blue and green- not all the inlays are preserved). The scene is executed in flat raised relief with the exception of the scarab which is executed in high raised relief with the prothorax and elytra being treated as three cloisonn\u00e9 which would at one time, have contained glass inlays. Part of a cavetto cornice is preserved at the top of the obverse.\r\nThe reverse is decorated in the following manner: at the top there are the partial remains of a cavetto cornice. Below this there is a scene, executed in incised line drawing, framed by a large band within which is a narrower band broken up into a pattern of alternating large and small rectangles. The scene consists of a seated figure of Osiris before whom is a small offering stand (or flower). The god is labelled by an inscription which reads \"Osiris, Lord of Eternity.\" to the right stands the deceased, wearing a long skirt, and holding his hands up in adoration of the god. \r\nCondition: Most inlays are missing; upper right, upper left, and lower right corners are missing as is most of the top. The piece is incrusted and dirty, and parts of the outline of Osiris are worn away.", "medium": "Faience, stone, glass", "dimensions": "3 1/8 x 2 15/16 x 3/8 in.
