No indication is made as to whether the line marking the prohibited area is still in force or not.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000340#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
