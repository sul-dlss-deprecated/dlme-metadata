Dear Lacy, I ought to have written by last hag about the question of armed smugglers (your telegram No » 104 of Novemher 9th and much previous correspondence ). The last development was that Adi put up to the other Departments concerned a proposal that foreigners charged under the ohjectionahle law, though they would he tried and sentenced under its provisions, should he imprisoned in the ordinary civil prisons under the Ministry of Justice. He said that if this were done there v/ould he no difficulty about their communicatj.ng with their Consuls and being visited in prison. Unfortunately Adi left for Geneva before it was known whether this system would he adopted. Samiy is, as you know, ill and likely to he so for some time and I fear we shall have to wait for Adl*s return to get anything final. Mohsein Rais, who is now in charge, is agreeable hut terrified of taking any decision - and one can’t blame him. There has till, so Adi telis me, been no case dealt with under the law. One can only hope it may he in course of becoming a dead letter. Yours ever, (Sd.) H. SEYMOUR. H. L. Baggallay, Esq.

It will be seen that this is a question of considerable difficulty.and it is by no means easy to lay down any precise instructions by which a Consular o&gt;.;.ieor should be guided in cases which appear to call for a refer ence to the Safeguards. In one connection such a reference may always be made without hesitation,namely in the event of any attempt to reopen oases heard before the judicial tribunals of the capitulatory regime. The provisions of Safeguard 14 being retroactive.it is pos&amp;iw^o to appeal to it,without raising the general question of the validity of the provisions in the Safeguards which were intended to /govern (Vice-Consul His Majesty*s (Consul /Consul-Oeneraloases arisiag iu the future* m other cases you should bear in mind that it is undesirable to provoke any dleeufiKion of this general question with the Iranian Crovernment* An appeal to the ~afeguards should therefore,if possible,be avoifled,when it would probably cause a reference of the question at issue to Tehran, since this tai^ht well lead the Iranian Oovernaient forcibly to declare that they are not in any way bou id by their provisions, nor should the Safeguards be invoked if any representations can be adequately based on general international law and practice* hut there may well be cases where a discreet reference to the safeguards may prove useful with provincial oxa.i.uial8 and courts* Ifous in February 19^6 the lovernor-Oeneral of Khuci«tan,on being shown the text of Safeguard 7,at once gave instructions that His Majesty's Viee-Oonsul at ^horraashahr should be allowed to visit a British subject uiid^r arrest at Abadan,though permission had previously been refused.

In Mr. Eden’s opinion, the important consideration from the practical point of view is not that the trial of a person accused of an offence under the Smuggling Law should be public, but that the Consul should know of the case, and be able to ascertain the charge and the general nature of the evidence given as well as the verdict. He considers, therefore, that, in any conversation with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Seymour might point out that even if the Persian Government cannot agree to a public trial or to the attendance of the Consular Officer concerned at the trial, there is no reason why the latter should not be given full information about it. 3.

Head of .European Department called on me to say that Iranian Government could only regard the note as criticism of a matter entirely within their province and that reply would be of a very stiff character. This is no doubt true as question will be dealt with by Ministiy of ar as well as Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will I understand also be submitted to the fJiah. Official asked whether I would not prefer to withdraw the note rather than engage in a controversy which could become soiaewhat violent. In the course of a long discussion in which I explained again the real reasons for our representations the official assured me repeatedly that foreign subjects accused under the law in question would have the right to legal assistance before tribunal and would also have right to communicate with their Consuls in wriling. As discussion proceeded it appeared to me possible that, from the practical point of view, we might place ourselves in a stronger position for the future by the following procedure. I should take back the note and address letter to head of European Department referring to our discussion and saying that, as he had explained that legal representation b efore tribunal was permitted and that the accused could communicate in writing with Consuls it would be unnecessary for me to address official representationsrepresentations to Iranian Government. I therefore undertook to thinK over message fruai Minister for Foreign Affairs and let him know the result in due course. I did not of course mention possible alternative. While this procedure would not be entirely satisfactory I think it might provide a better safeguard for the future of accused persons than an official correspondence in which Iranian Government will decline to give any undertakings what ever and in which they evidently intend to reject in very energetic terms our right to make representations regarding their procedure, especially as no case having yet been dealt with under new law we cannot point to any instance in which injustice has resulted. For these reasons I thinK better practical results might follow alternative procedure suggested and should be glad of instructions.

Sir, With his despatch No. 451 of the 1st October, 1936, Mr. Butler enclosed a translation of a Persian law passed on the 9th July, 1936, providing that smugglers who resist arrest by force of arms shall henceforth be sentenced to death. In the same despatch Mr. Butler also raised the question of the present validity of the ’'Safeguards” in general. 2. The problems raised in Mr. Butler's despatch may conveniently be considered under the following four headings, of which the first two cover the law itself and the second two the 'Safeguards”: (a) Is the law compatible with the 'Safeguards”? (b) Apart from the 'Safeguards”, is the law open to objection in itself? (c) Has the expiry of the Tariff Autonorr^ Treaty of the 10th May, 1928, affected the validity of the 'Safeguards”? (d) Leaving the Tariff Autonomy Treaty on one side, what is to-day the validity of the 'Safeguards”? 3. With regard to (a), a comparison of the new law with Section 3 of the 'Safeguards” certainly suggests that the provision for the trial of armed smugglers by military courts is, in the absence of any saving clause for foreigners, or at any rate for British subjects, incompatible with the terms of that section. It is true that the vagueness/ Seymour, Esq., C.I.LG. , C.V.O., etc., etc., etc., Tehran.vagueness of the phrase 'en general” in paragraph 2 of Section 3 night enable the Persian Government to argue that there was no incompatibility between them, since they were entitled, given good cause, to try a British subject by a military Court. But, on the other hand, paragraph 3 of the same section appears to specify the exceptions covered by ”en general”, and to limit them to cases occurring during a state of siege. I am therefore advised that, on the whole, the law must be regarded as being, from the legal point of view, repugnant to the ’’Safeguards”, assuming them to be still valid. 4. With regard to (b), the new law clearly presents serious difficulties. Smuggling offences are apt from their nature to occur on or near international boundaries, and cases might occur in which the defence, or part of the defence, of a British subject or British protected person accused of an offence under this law might be that he was not in Persian territory or waters at all when arrested (i.e. he might enter a total denial of jurisdiction). If any such person were tried before a military court, from which all observers and perhaps all counsel might be excluded, His Majesty’s Legation or the Consulate concerned would, even if they knew of the arrest and trial, have no guarantee that such a defence was given proper weight by the court. The danger of such cases occurring is not lessened by the Persian claim to a six mile belt of territorial waters or by the fact that parts of the Baluchistan frontier have not been demarcated upon the ground. 5. Moreover, while it is true that no basis exists in international law for contending that should Persia choose/choose to render smuggling offences, or certain types of smuggling offences, triable in a military court, instead of as usual before a civil court, she would not be fully within her rights in doing so, such a change of jurisdiction cannot justify an evasion of the international rule that the trial of a foreign national must be sufficiently fair to comply with international standards, so as not to involve what is known as a denial of justice. In particular, the accused must have a propeb opportunity of defending himself whatever the composition and competence of the court which tries him. 6 . His Majesty’s Government could most effectively satisfy themselves that these conditions were being fulfilled (in the case of the arrest and trial before a military court of a British subject or British protected person) and could most effectively satisfy themselves as to the locality in which the arrest took place (in the case of an arrest under the present law) if the arrested person were allowed to communicate with the nearest British Consular officer and the consular officer were able to visit him in prison. This is in fact what ’’Safeguard” Ho. 7 was meant to provide, and, if it were advisable to invoke the ’’Safeguards” at all in this connexion, I am advised that ’’Safeguard” No. 7 should be invoked in preference to ’’Safeguard” No. 3, especially as His Majesty’s Government would not thereby be committed to maintaining that any diing that the Persian Government had done up to the present time was a breach of the ’’Safeguards”. It would be difficult for the Persian Government to show that any changes had taken place in Persia since 1928 in regard to the law or legal procedure which had rendered this ’’Safeguard”/'Safeguard' out of date, whereas there would be some justification for a similar contention in the case of some of the other 'Safeguards'. 7. In view of the foregoing considerations, I request that you will, provided you see no objection, draw the attention of the Persian Government in whatever manner you.think best to the extreme severity of the penalties laid down in the new law, and to the possibility that a serious incident might be provoked if a British subject or British protected person were to suffer these penalties in a case where, owing to the secrecy of the proceedings and the complete ignorance of any British official of what had taken place, His Majesty’s Government were not in a position to reassure the public that the principles of natural justice had been observed, - more particularly if it could not be clearly shown that the arrest had taken place within Persian jurisdiction. You should then state that His Majesty's Government consider it essential, as the only means of being able in such an event to satisfy themselves on both these points, that, in any such case, His Majesty’s Legation or the nearest British Consular officer should be advised without delay that a British subject or British protected person whom it was pronosed to try under and in accordance with this law had been arrested, and that one of His Majesty’s Consular officers should be able to visit the arrested person in prison and attend the subsequent trial. I leave it to your discretion to decide whether or not 'Safeguard' No. 7 should be mentioned in the first place. It is in no way essential that it should be. With regard to (c), Mr. Butler suggested, in his 8.r semi-official letter of the 1st October, 1936, to Ur. Bafgallay, (Ho. 231/6/36), that the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty has tended to deprive the 'Safeguards ’ 1 of any validity which they may previously have had in international law. In this connexion it will be remembered that the view expressed in paragraph 4 of Sir John Simon’s despatch No. 451 of the 6 th November, 1933, to Mr. Mallet, was that there is no juridical connexion between the Treaty and the 'Safeguards'note in the sense that the duration of the one is governed by the other. This view has been repeated more recently in Mr. Baggallay’s semi-official letter to Mr. Butler of the 28th May, 1936, to which Mr. Butler refers. I am still advised that this view is correct and that the continuance in force of the treaty is consequently not an essential condition for the continued validity of the 'Safeguards'. But this does not exclude the possibility, contemplated in the same paragraph of the above-mentioned despatch of the 6 th November, 1933, that the one was part of the consideration for the other. It is possible to undertake an obligation of indefinite duration in return for a service which may (or can) be performed once and once only. In the present case the theoretical argument, for what it is worth, would be that the Persian Government, in return for the grant of tariff autonomy at the end of eight years, undertook for an indeterminate period to treat British subjects according to a certain code. Moreover no stipulation exists, either in the text of the treaty or in the 'Safeguards' note, to the effect that the obligations undertaken in those two instruments should have the same duration. The termination of/of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty does not therefore affect the validity of the ’’Safeguards', and no real inconsistency exists between the views which have from time to time been expressed by the Foreign Office upon this question. 9. There remains point (d). It must unfortunately be recognised that, whatever may be their theoretical validity, the 'Safeguards' have lost much of their practical value. On the other hand, it is possible to maintain that His Majesty’s Government are still justified, for the reasons put forward in paragraph 7 of the despatch of the 6 th November, 1933, in regarding the 'Safeguards' as a guarantee for the continued maintenance of certain standards of equity and justice in the treatment of foreigners under Persian law and procedure. 10. For the foregoing reasons, therefore, I consider it would be possible for you to maintain, without inconsistency, both that the validity of the 'Safeguards' note, whatever that may be, is not affected by the termination of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, and that the 'Safeguards' note was part of the consideration for that treaty. At the same time, I consider that no useful purpose would be served by raising the general question of the Safeguards' at this juncture, either in connexion with the smuggling law, or, so far as can be foreseen in advance of a particular case arising, in connexion with any other technical breach of the 'Safeguards', especially as it would be possible, if a breach were so serious as to be contrary to natural justice, to make a diplomatic protest without invoking the 'Safeguards' at all. The 'Safeguards' note/note should in fact, so far as possible, be held in reserve as a general guarantee that the Persian Government intend to maintain a certain level of justice in their administration and procedure.

S.W.l. 23rd December, 1936. (i/wj hi*** I am directed 'by Mr. Secretary Eden to transmit to you, to 'be laid iDefore the Marquess of Zetland, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject”of a Persian law, passed on the 9th July, 1936, for the better prevention of smuggling. In this despatch Mr. Butler also raises the general question of the ’’Safeguards” i.e. the assurances contained in 0 i 1 * i X M. Pakrevan’s note of the 10th May, 1928, to Sir Robert Clive (see Treaty Series Ho.43 of 1935 - Ca4^ 5054). 2, The problems which Mr. Butler raises may conveniently be considered under the following four headings, of which the first two cover the law itself and the second two the ’’Safeguards”: (a) Is the law compatible with the ’’Safeguards”? (b) Apart from the ’’Safeguards”, is the law open to objection in itself? (c) Has the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 10th May, 192b, affected the validity of the ’’Safeguards”? (d) Leaving the Tariff Autonomy Treaty on one side, what is today the validity of the ’’Safeguards'? V/ith regard to (a) a comparison of the new law with Section 3 of the ’’Safeguards” certainly suggests that the/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office.the provision for the trial of armed smugglers by military courts is, in the absence of any saving clause for foreigners, or at any rate for British subjects, incompatible with the terms of that section. It is true that the vagueness of the phrase 'en g£n£ral' in paragraph 2 of Section 3 might enable the Persian Government to argue that there was no incompatibility between them, since they were entitled, given good cause, to try a British subject by a military Court. But, on the other hand, paragraph 3 of the same section appears to specify the exceptions covered by 'en gdndrai', and to limit them to cases occurring during a state of siege. Mr. Eden is therefore advised that, on the whole, the law must be regarded as, from the legal point of view, repugnant to the 'Safeguards', assuming their continued validity. 4. With regard to (b), the new law clearly presents serious difficulties. Smuggling offences are apt from their nature to occur on or near international boundaries, and cases might occur in v/hich the defence, or part of the defence, of a British subject or British protected person accused of an offence under this law might be that he was not in Persian territory or waters at all when arrested (i.e. he might enter a total denial of jurisdiction). If any such person were tried before a military court, from which all observers and perhaps all counsel might be excluded, His Majesty ! s Legation or the Consulate concerned would, even if they knew of the arrest and trial have no guarantee that such a defence was given proper weight by the court. The danger of such cases occurring is not lessened by the Persian claim to a six mile belt of territorial waters or by the fact that parts of the Baluchistan frontier have not been demarcated upon the ground. Moreover, while it is true that no basis exists in international law for contending that Persia, should she choose to render smuggling offences, or certain types of smuggling/V./ smuggling offences, triable in a military court, instead of as usual before a civil court, would not be fully within her rights in doing so, such, a change of jurisdiction cannot justify an evasion of the international rule that the trial of a foreign national must be sufficientlyf air to comply with international standards, so as not to involve what is known as a denial of justice. In particular, the accused must have a proper opportunity of defending himself whatever the composition and competence of the court which tries him. 5 . His Majesty's Government could most effectively satisfy themselves that these conditions were being fulfilled, in the case of the arrest and trial before a military court of a British subject or British protected person, and could most effectively satisfy themselves as to the locality in which the arrest took place, in the case of an arrest under the present law, if the arrested person were allowed to communicate with the nearest British Consular officer and tne Consular officer were able to visit him in prison, ihis is in fact what ’'Safeguard' No.7 was meant to provide, and, if it were advisable to invoke the 'Safeguards' at all in this connexion, Mr. Eden is advised that 'Safeguard' No.7 should be invoked in preference to 'Safeguard' No.3, especially as his Majesty's Government would not thereby be committed to maintaining that anything that the Persian Government had done up to the present time was a breach of the 'Safeguards . Furthermore, it would be difficult for the Persian Government to show that any changes had taken place in Persia since 1928 in regard to the law or legal procedure which would render this 'Safeguard' out of date, whereas there would be some justification for a similar contention in the case of some of the other 'SafeguardE'.^1 —' JifcS 7 . In view of the above considerations, Mr. Eden proposes, subject to the concurrence of Lord Zetland, to draw the attention of the Persian Government to the extreme severity of the penalties laid down in the new law. I'heir attention would be called to the possibility that a serious incident might be provoked if a British subject or British protected person were to suffer these penalties in a case where, owing to the secrecy of the proceedings and the complete ignorance of any British official of what had taken place, His Majesty’s Government were not in a position to reassure the public that the principles of natural justice had been observed. This would be more particularly the case if it could not be clearly shown that the arrest had taken place within Persian jurisdiction. His Majesty's Government therefore consider it essential, as the only means of being able, in such an event, to satisfy themselves on both these points, that, in any such case, His Majesty's Legation or the nearest British Consular officer should be advised without delay that a British subject or British protected person whom it was proposed to try under and in accordance with this law had been arrested, and that one of His Majesty's Consular officers should be able to visit the arrested person in prison. whetner or not 'Safeguard' No.7 should be mentioned in the first place is a point which, in the opinion of Mr. Eden, could be left to the discretion of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. It is in no way essential that it should be. q # With regard to (c), I am to draw attention to a semi-official letter of the 1st October, 1936, from Mr.Butler a copy of which is enclosed. In this letter it is suggested that the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty has tended to deprive the 'Safeguards' of any validity which they may previously/previously have had in international law. In this connexion, Lord Zetland will recollect that the view expressed in paragraph 4 of* Sir John Simon 1 s despatch of the 6 th November, 1933, to His Majesty* s Minister at Tehran (see Foreign Office letter No. E 2433/1622/34 of the 24th November 1933) was that there was no juridical connexion between the treaty and the ’'Safeguards 11 note in the sense that the duration of one is governed by the other. This view has been repeated more recently in the semi official letter of the 29th May last (see Foreign Office letter No. E 3890/385/34 of 29th July) to which Mr. Butler refers. Mr. Eden still holds that this view is correct and that the continuance in force of the treaty is consequently not an essential condition for the continued validity of the 'Safeguards’! But this does not exclude the possibility, contemplated in i»he same paragraph of the above-mentioned despatch of 6 th ^.lOvemoer, 1933, that the one was part of the consideration for the other. It is possible to undertake an obligation of indefinite duration in return for a service which may (or can) be performed once and once only* In the present case the theoretical argument, for v/hat it is worth, is that the Persian Government, in return for the grant of tariff autonomy at the end of eight years, undertook for an indeterminate period to treat British subjects according to a certain code. Moreover no stipulation exists, either in the text of the treaty or in the ”Safeguards” note, to the effect that the obligations undertaken in those two instruments should have the same duration. Mr. Eden is therefore advised that the termination of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty does not affect the validity of the ’’Safeguards”, and that no real inconsistency exists between the views which have from time to time been expressed by the Foreign Office upon this question. 9./9. There remains point (d). It must unfortunately be recognized that, whatever may be their theoretical validity, the 'Safeguards' have lost much of their practical value. On the other hand, it is possible to maintain that His Majesty’s Government are still justified, for the reasons put forward in paragraph 7 of the despatch of 6 th November, 1933, referred to above, in regarding the 'Safeguards' as a guarantee for the continued maintenance of certain standards of equity and justice in the treatment of foreigners under Persian law and procedure. 10. Mr* Eden would therefore prefer, so far as the 'Safeguards' are concerned, to inform His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that he can without inconsistency maintain both that the validity of the 'Safeguards' note, whatever that may be, is not affected by the termination of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, and that the 'Safeguards' note was part of the consideration for that treaty. It would, however, at the same time be explained that Mr. Eden considers that no useful purpose would be served by raising the general question of the 'Safeguards' at this juncture, either in connexion with the smuggling law, or, so far as can be foreseen in advance of a particular case arising, in connexion with any other technical breach of the 'Safeguards', especially as it would be possible, if a breach were so serious as to be contrary to natural justice, to make a diplomatic protest without invoking the 'Safeguards' at all. The 'Safeguards' note should, in Mr* Eden’s opinion, be held in reserve as a general guarantee that the Persian Government intend to maintain a certain level of justice. I am to request that Mr. Eden may be furnished with Lord Zetland’s views upon this letter. 1 2 . Copies of this letter are being sent to the Dominions Office and Colonial Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,COPY (E 6589/6589/34) British Legation, Ho. 451 Gulhek, (231/5/36) 1st October, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a law passed on the 9th July last, providing that smugglers who resist arrest by the force of arms shall henceforth be sentenced to death. Smugglers in possession of arms who surrender without resistance, are to have their sentence reduced by two degrees, which means life imprison ment or a lesser sentence at the discretion of the judge; and unarmed persons in the company of armed smugglers are to be sentenced to a term of hard labour ranging from three to fifteen years. 2. Article 3 of the law provides that smugglers in the possession of arms are henceforth to be tried by a military court. In so far as British subjects are concerned, this article clearly runs counter to safeguard No.3 and I have therefore thought it well to take the opportunity to review the present position with regard to the safeguards in general. 3. Paragraph 6 of Sir John Simon’s despatch No.451 (E 2433/1622/34) of the 6th November, 1933, concludes that ’'it would probably be held that the so-called 'safeguards’* do not constitute an international engagement in the sense that, in so far as they are embodied in provisions of Persian law, the Persian Government, are not entitled to change them without the consent of the foreign Governments concerned”. Paragraph/ fhe^ght Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.Paragraph 7 then continues: ••it should not, however, he in hered from ttiis that the safeguards are wholly without value or ef i ect. His Majesty’s Government would, I am advised, he entitled to contend that although the Persian Government may have the right to alter the provisions of this law in matters which concern the safeguards, they are hound, unless and until tne law is thus altered, to observe its provisions rigidly, and consequently to apply the safeguards fully'. But if even at the date of that despatch it was to he presumed that the Persian Government had the right to 'alter the provisions of their law in matters which concern the safeguards', subsequent events have considerably increased the difficulty of adopting a contrary attitude. In the first place a considerable volume of legislation has been placed on the statute-book in the interval which lias radically changed the situation Since the assurances were given; and the Persian Government thus have ample precedents on which they could rely in the event of any protest with regard to the present law. More important still in this connexion would appear to be the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, since it was held in paragraph 4 of Sir John Simon’s above-quoted despatch that 'the strongest argument which His Majesty’s Government could probably make for the internationally binding character of the safeguards would be based on the fact that they were signed on the same date as the Tariff Autonomy Treaty and on the contention that they were tbua really part of the consideration for that Treaty'. Thus though the expiry of that Treaty would hardly seem to be a co elusion factor is the situation, it would yet appear to have shorn/&amp; shorn away the main buttress of the contention that the safe guards formed part of a binding international agreement. 4. In so far as it is relevant to cite the view of lawyers in Tehran, I would also mention that in a memorandum prepared early this year by Maitre Raphael Aghababoff, a lead- in , Armenian lawyer here, on the subject of the juridical situation of foreigners in Iran, it is stated the safeguards 'sont considerees par le gouvemement de n'avoir aucune valeur legale et ne sont pas reconnus par les autorites iraniennes”. This may undoubtedly be taken as being the view of the average lawyer here. It is true that when an employe of the Anglo- Ij anian Oil Company was arrested at Abadan early this year, an appeal to the safeguards by His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Khorramshahr apparently carried some weight with the Governor! but I think that the conclusion to be drawn from this is that. Just as new regulations take some time to penetrate to the provinces, so do old ones linger on for some time before they are recognised as extinct. Leaving aside for the moment the merits of the case, I do not think that an appeal to the safe- uards in Tehran to-day would have the slightest chance of success* 5. Taking all the above into account, I presume that you would not desire His Majesty's Legation either to protest against the provisions of Article 3 of this law or to intervene snonla a British Subject charged with being a smuggler in the possession of arms, be tried before a military court. I should however, be grateful for your irstructions on this point and also in due course on the wider question of the present validity of the safeguards in general. 6. In conclusion it is perhaps of interest to notice that this law was not passed by the Majlis in the ordinary way. It/It was approved by the judicial committee of the Majlis and was then promulgated over the signature of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice. Theoretically the laws enacted by this simplified procedure are supposed only to enter into force experimentally and if the Minister in charge of the Department concerned finds them defective, he should report back to the Majlis. Actually he does so but rarely. It is interesting to note that even important and lengthy lav/s, notably the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, have been .assed in this simplified v/ay. 7.

No. 231/6/36 1 st October, 1936. Dear Lacy, Will you please refer to my despatch No. 451 of to-day in regard to the new law about smuggling and its conflict with the safeguards? 2. In paragraph 4 of this despatch I have quoted paragraph 4 of Foreign Office despatch No. 451 (E 2433/ 1622/34) of the 6 th November, 1933, which stated that the strongest argument which we could probably adduce for the internationally binding character of the safe guards lay in their connexion with the Tariff Autonomy Treaty; and I have gone on to suggest that the expiry of the Treaty now deprives u£ of this argument. In so doing, I have not been unmindful of paragraph 2 of your letter (E 2822/385/34) of the 28th May last in which you say that you agree that the exchange of notes embodying the safeguards has no real connexion with the Treaty. At first there would seem to be some contradiction between your letter and the above-mentioned Foreign Office despatch but as I see it, the contradiction is more apparent than real. Is it not the fact that we have admitted to ourselves for a long time that the safeguards could not be held to be an international obligation binding the Persian Government and that we regarded their connexion with the treaty as no more than a useful argument which could be adduced in case of need in support of a contrary view? If this is so, then your letter does no more than imply that we are now willing to abandon an argument which H. L. Baggallay Esq., we / Foreign Office.we never regarded as conclusive and our rnain view, i.e. that the Persians are entitled to amend their law in matters touching the safeguards, remains unchanged. I have however, thought it well to mention the effect of the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty on the safeguards in so far as it seems to deprive us of what was formerly regarded as a useful argument. n* Our best line now would seem to be to argue, as in your letter, that the safeguards are unaffected by the expiry of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty and that they still retain the value given to them in paragraph 7 of the above- mentioned Foreign Office despatch. But in putting the matter to you officially I have felt obliged to record the view which we hold here that there is no long any possibility in pr actice of our being able to appeal to the safeguards with any hope of success (in Tehran at any rate). 4. Needless to say any new expression of Foreign Office views about the safeguards in due course would be of great interest to us here.
