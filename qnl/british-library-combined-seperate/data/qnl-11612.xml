Bell gives a description of the causes of the rebellion against the Sultan of Muscat, which, in her opinion, were 'partly due to old and deepseated matters of disagreement and partly to the reflex action of modern European politics'. She goes on to describe various events from May 1913 to July 1916, including: the fall of Nizwa [Nizwá] and Izki [Izkī]; the visit of the Viceroy to Muscat in February 1914; the death of Fayṣal; the religious character of the uprising ('Jihad'); and potential peace terms.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Gertrude Margaret Lowthian Bell</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Taymūr bin Fayṣal Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0003c8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
