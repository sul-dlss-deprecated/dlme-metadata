C. 80, dated the 27th January 1916, 1 have the honour to forward herewith copy of a letter X T o. 4657 G.O., dated 29th idem, from the General Ofticer Commanding, Aden, to the Chief of Geneial Stall, Celhi, forwarding a report from the General Staff Officer, Aden Brigade, who accompanied Colonel Jacob on his recent visit to the Idrisi Saiyid. I am forwarding copies of this letter and its accompaniments direct to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi, and His Britannic Majesty's High Commissioner, Cairo. Copy forwarded, with compliments, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. . With reference to my telegram Xo. 167 A.P. of Jrd instant, i have the honour to submit an extract of a report by Major C. U. Bradshaw, General Staff, Aden, on the Idrissi movement from a military point of view. 2. During November last, the Idrissi informed us of his dispositions, from which it was understood that his intention was to seize Lahiva. He was offered naval co-operation to achieve this object. He pointed out that though the Turks lightly held that place, they assured its safety by the presence of Turkish-Arab forces, well equipped in guns, in strong natural positions flanking his communications to the east and south, and (hough seizure of the town by coup-de-main would not be a difficult operation, it would result in his own discomfiture, unless his enemies were first ousted from their positions in the hill tracts, which he was not strong enough to effect. This summed up his appreciation of the situation. 3. Shortly after, his force was pressed back to its present position. It is apparent that the Idrissi has no thought of resuming the offensive. He is devoting his attention to consolidating his political influence, and to winning over influential tribes, through the assistance offered to him by our treaty and trade policy. s. 300.

Sir,4 He is still of material assistance to us in weaning Arabs liom the Turks by these means and in detaining Turkish troops who otherwise m hdit be spared for service at Lahej. Our latest information indicates, however, that one battalion, if not two battalions, have been withdrawn from the Idrissi frontier and are en route for Lahej. 5 In the matter of assisting the Idrissi with rilles and ammunition. Previous enquiries from the Idrissi and his Agent have elicited that the Idrissi possessed Italian rifles and Le Gras in equal proportion. It would appear the Italian rifles far outnumber the French. The Idrissi has several times pressed us to obtain Weterli ammunition for these Italian rifles. The Italian Government, however, have expressed their inability to provide any. I am not aware of any other source of supply, and yet without it a huge number of the Idrissi’s armed retainers will become ineffective gradually. I would ask if there is any possibility of this ammunition being manu factured for issue to the Idrissi on payment. A million rounds ol Le Gras have been sent to the Idrissi during the course of the W ar. A consignment of another million has just been received, which it is intended to retain for the oresent. 6. The Idrissi has not requisitioned upon us for lilies until recently, when lie urgently asked for 1,000 Le Gras rifles on payment wherewith to arm the Rijal-al-Ma. a tribe on his Northern territory. Djibouti cannot supply this rifle now, and the Secretary of State for India has been requested to approach the French Government with a view to the demand being met. 7. Though our assistance to the Idrissi has been confined hitherto to supplying him with rifle ammunition and a few' rifles, I think it essential ♦that we should help him with gun ammunition. There is some reason to believe that the passive role he lias assumed is not wholly uninfluenced by want of confidence to meet his enemies with lack of gun ammunition. Major Bradshaw has brought with him patterns of the shells such as the Idrissi requires, and I would suggest that l maybe informed by cable to whom 1 should send these shells for report as to the possibility of obtaining a supply. 8. Major Bradshaw reports that the Idrissi possesses some 3,000 Turkish Mauser rifles for which he has a scant supply of ammunition. If there is any captured stock of this ammunition in Mesopotamia I would suggest that a consignment he sent to me to keep in hand for issue when considered desirable. I have, Ac., C. If.

When at (iaizan, not knowing Arahie, I was unable to understand the conversation with him at the meeting, but from the answers to questions, w hieli were asked at my request, and from enquiries I made through the other means available, 1 came away with the following impressions from a military point of view ; — That military operations were not uppermost in the mind of the Idrissi or of his Prime Minister. He appears to have withdrawn his tribesmen within his own sphere of influence to the south, that is approximately along the Wadi Ain. Ilis own lighting men seem to be back on the line Buhais-Kidf- al-Butri, and the guns and the bulk of his own men, other than tribesmen, in the Medi district. The l urks or the Turkish Arabs do not seem to have followed up the Idrissi force when it retired in November 11)15 from .Ihanda and Wayidat, but to have remained in their former positions, having received somewhat of a severe check from the Idrissi force, sufficient probably to discourage any offensive against them. The main route from the north to the south is that from Medi via 1 bight ha, Kidf-al-Butri, and thence to Baigha and to Zoln a and Lahiya. The Turks and Turkish Arabs have not outposts further north than the general line Dor Shuma-darb, and are disposed at the important junctions in Wadidat and along tin? Wadi Maur. That is in their former positions. The Idrissi and his Prime Minister appeared to have no notion of the number (titular) of the Turkish battalions or regiments. The only facts that appeared to be impressed on their minds, were that the Turks were much stronger than they-are in artillery, and that the Turks had about 3,000 lighting men available. These were not collected, but dispersed as stated above. I'hey also said that the Turks had no really senior officer anywhere up in their direction, and that the senior officer—Lieutenant- Colonel Bagib Bey —is a very poor commander, whom they did not fear in the least. Some Turks were acknowledged to be still with the Imam at 'Sanaa. The proportion of Syrian Arabs in the Turkish battalions is great, in most cases as much as fifty per centum. The Arab portion are dis contented with the Turks judging by the remarks of an Arab deserter, who was handed over :: ‘ with an Asiatic * At our request by the Idrissi. r| , , .. • i .i • i lurk, lie said they received no pay and the Turks got everything first and they last. He said they were longing to get rid of them. The Imam and the Turkish commander at Abha appear to be able to correspond occasionally by the inland route Sadah-Abha, but this can only be done when a trustworthy Bedouin can be got to take the letter. Otherwise, this route is still closed to the movement of troops, supplies, or consignments in any appreciable amount. Mv general impression is that there is “nothing doing ' in the military line in Asir now, that is nothing of an offensive character against the Turks, but the mere fact that the Idrissi is hostile to the Turk, and an enemy of the Imam, has a military advantage lot us. hioni what 1 could gailmij s. 3U0. A *1 here are still srwn battalions locked up in the triangle I lodeidah-Sanaa- . . lioheivah. with a certain number of * About 20 (Field and Mountain). . . . . guns' 1 'and ammunition. Ibis is what has been estimated to be there. As long as the Idrissi retains his hostility to the Turks and to the Imam this number of battalions is likely to be retained in the north. I further got the impression that the Idrissi does not intend to do anything more for the present, except to remain in comparative readiness. His attitude is attributable to two main reasons :— (1) lie is not at all sure who is going to win the war, and like all smaller potentates, he does not want to. commit himself further before he is reasonably sure. (-) He really is not in a position to take on the Turks with any certainty of success, as although he has a great many rifles and an equal el even greater number of guns than the Turks on his southern frontier, yet he has a limited number of rounds for the Italian guns and rifles, and, what is more, he sees no prospect of obtaining any further supplies for these. His guns, except for five captured from the Turks, are all Italian, and he states that he has only 100 to lot) rounds per gun left. He intimated that he could not do anything with this amount. This is quite natural, for these rounds are all that really stand between him and the possibility (military) of all his tribesmen being subdued by the Turks. The Turks have subdued and hold the Yemen by their guns; they are usually much inferior in rifle power to the Arabs, that is in the number of riflemen they can send out with their guns, the Arab being an equally good (or bad) shot as compared with the Turk. The Idrissi cannot be really expected, there fore, to do any more unless he can be assured of an ammunition supply for his guns. The following is the number of guns he acknowledges as having :— ' . 1 heavy, Italian. 10 field, Italian. 10 mountain, Italian. 5 mountain, Turkish (captured) bO rounds per gun only. His position as regards rifles is almost as unsatisfactory. He states that by far the greater number of his rilles are also Italian, the number quoted being 30,000. For these he has only (100 boxes of 1,000, i.c., o'2 rounds per rifle. If he had alf these rilles in his own hand this would enable him to equip 3,200 men with 300 rounds, which is not much, when there is no reserve behind them. (The Arab is apt also to waste ammunition in feu-de-joies, Ac.) Besides this 1 believe that the majority of these rifles have already been distributed among his tribesmen, who must all be given some ammunition, if any of them are going out to light. He stated that he had got two to three thousand Mausers (Turkish) and four thousand Le (bras rilles. It is only for the latter that he has a good supply of ammunition owing to the arrangements made by Government. He has also % a few hundred Martini and some ammunition. He seems to thoroughly realise how unsound his admixture of rifles is, and the difliculties ol ammunition supply of such a mixture, but as long as we cannot help himto get Weterli ammunition, or give him a large number of rifles with ammunition we can supply, his position must remain unsound. I lie Idiissi has about one-third of Ins forces and guns disposed on his noithem bordei, and two-thirds in the southern, lie is slightly stronger than the lurks on his northern border, and with enough gun ammunition would probably try and regain ground towards Abha and Kunfidah. Although he cannot do much just now he is still of military value as an a U y&gt; Ky mere tact of Ins unfriendliness to the lurk and Imam, rather than by any action he can take. He cannot in his present situation be relied to draw any Turks northwards from Lahej, as the threat he creates is not sufficient. I have brought patterns of the shell he needs most, that is held and mountain.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000256_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B228</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000256</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B228</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'[Letter] from Brigadier-General C H U Price, Political Resident, Aden, to the Secretary to Government, Political Department, Bombay'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-31T14:08:02</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (3 folios)</extent><extent>The file consists of a single document.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 33, and terminates at f 35, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
