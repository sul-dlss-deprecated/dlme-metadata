' ^ / A Bushire P.L. Nc mrr Reference to previous correspondence : Name and Date. Subject. letter to Retioency Agent, Trucial Coast, flo. datea 5th January 1932.Following is the information given by K.B. f Isa bin ♦Abdul Latif,Residency Agent,Sh^rgah •bout the dispute between the Ruler of Abu Phabi and the Ruler of Shargah over the quest ion of erecting buildings at 3irr Abu lln f air Island. ” At the time when Shaikh Salim bin Sultan was the Ruler of Sh-rgah end Zaid was the Ruler of Abu Phabi, the first wanted to hsive some buildings er o ct°d at Sirr Abu Hu*air Island I but the Ruler of Abu Phabi complained to Sir Percy Cox, the ther tt Political Resident who prevented the Shaikh of Shurrah from doing so in ord^r to void trouble between them. The matter was J then ended at this stage i*. ' At the time of Colonel Trevor, Khalid bin Ahmad wanted the the i Ruler of Shargah to build in the island and informed me of his intention. I referred the matter to the Hon ’Ve the FoMtical Resident who replied that the Government have no objection to his doing so. On hearing this the Ruler of Abu Ph bi wrote a letter to the then Ruler of Shargah asking him to ref-nin from doing this failing which he will declare war ag^ li st him. The Ruler of Sh ,rr h then gave the idea and the matter was settled amicably between them?. ” Few days ago I received a secret letter from the Hon’ble the P.R. instructing me to inform all the Shaikhs in a private manner to hoist their flags on all the Islands belongin, to them so that the Persian Government m y not claim suet Isixn Isl ands. I accordingly informed all the Shaikhs. As a result of thiu + he Shr ikh of Shargah sent his brother to erect a flag i staff which he did. He ^Iso sent three men to guard it and to remain in the Island to fly the flag every day. Taking this opportunity the Shaikh of Shargah is trying now to have some buildings erected there. But the Rulers of Pubai and Abu Phabi will not,however, agree to this nd unless he gives up the idea the result will be fight between them. If the Sirr Abu Hu’air is inhabited it will bause a great loss to both Pubai and Abu Ph -; bi '.Shaikh H.A.

If the Shaikh of Shargah is going to make some buildings there, we will stop him. 7/e will fight against him in order to prevent him. Shaikh Shakhbut repeats what his brother had said. You are all our friends and matters can be settled amine ab ly. But will you prevent the Shaikh of Shargah until you can see about this matter I know nothing about this matter and have to refer the matter to Bushire before T can say anything. Yes, but the R’ler of Shargah should be prevented from doing any building there. w : cuje. * i ?1 On the 10th June 1933 H.M.S 'Fowey” anchored at Abu Dhabi at 09.15 hours after some difficulty in finding the place owing to the haze. Shortly afterwards Khan Bahadur Isa bin Abdul Latif (Residency Agency) came on board. He said that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was prepared to allow an emergency landing ground to be made but that he was not prepared to any buildings. The Political Agent asked whether he should mention the matter to the Shaikh in the course of the return call and the Residency Agent said that it would be alright. 2. Shortly afterwards Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid came on board w 7 ith his three relatives Shaikh Eazza’ bin Sultan (brbther),Shaikh Khalid bin Sultan (brother) and Shaikh Hamid bin Buti (Uncle) and Ahmad bin Khalaf bin tT Ttaibah. He was met at the gangway by the First Lieutentant and brought to the Darfear place on the after part of the quarter deck. The Political Agent met him at the entrance to the Darbar space. Coffee was served and ordinary conversation passed. 3. The Shaikh raised the question of certain buildings which Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah was said to be erecting on Sir Bu Na'ir Island. He said that in the past when he had done so he had been 'prevented**. Apparently some question of this sort had arisen in the time of Sir Percy Cox and Colonel Trevor and the Political Agent promised to look into the matter. 4. It was arranged that the return call should be paid immediately after the Shaikh’s boat had reached the shore (H.M.S 'Fowey' was anchored about a mile from the shore). 5. After tib had been given the Shaikh took his leave. The Political Agent said good-bye to him just outside the Darbar area. It should be noted that on this occasion the Officer Commanding,H.M.S 'Fowey',was not present as he had it/ / to just returned from b* boat drill and v/as not ready&gt;so had asked the Political Agent to excuse him from being present. 6. As soon as the Shaikh’s launch had reached the shore the Political Agent went off in the Residency Agent’s launch (in this case a hired one from Pibai). The Political Agent’s flag was flown on the bow of the launch. The Shaikh received the Political Agent at the door of his house at the place where the landing took place, not at the Q,asr. This was understood to be according to precedent. Chairs had been provided but the Political Agent,who was accompanied by the Residency Agent and the Head liunshi sat in Arab style. Halwa was served and after that coffee. After some desu.li/ry conversation the Political Agent said that he would like to hove a talk with the Shaikh alone. All left except tlie Shaikh ,Sha ikh Hazza’,Shaikh Khalid,Ahmad bin Khalaf bin emergency landing ground has been reported separately. The conversation took from about 11.00 hours to 13.00 hours. On return the Shaikh accompanied the Political Agent to the shore. but the Residency Pgent stayed behind further to discuss the q .

I willThe Political Agent, Bahrain. 0 No.C/8 of 1942. Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, s.s. ♦Nearchus* at sea, Dated the 9th January, 1942. MEMORANDUM On the 9th January I visited Tamb Island. I under stand there are sone five houses of Persians on the island and fifteen of Arabs. 2. I saw some of the Persians who stated (a) that about a year ago the son of the Sheikh of Ras ul IChaima came to the island and took away his father’s flag (b] that at the same time he recovered £s.4o/- tribute from them. They stated that they expected another visit from the Sheikh’s men shortly and a demand for a further sum of ks.40/‘ as annual tribute. They stated they could not possibly afford such a large sum and asked me whether they had to pay it. In the absence of any information on the subject all I could say was that I would make enquiries. 3. With regard to (a) will you please enquire from the Sheikh of Ras ul Khaima whether he has in fact removed his flag and if so why. Although the Persian Government are unlikely to adopt an aggressive atitude in present circumstances, it is desirable that the Shaikh should continue to assert his claim. If therefore he has removed his flag he should be asked to send it back again. I understand Xunderstand it is the custom of the islanders to hoist it whenever a ship visits the island. It is of course possible that they have made away with it themselves in order to be in a better position to deny the Sheikas overlordship and to refuse to pay tribute. They certainly appeared rather sheep-faced and as if they had something on their consciences when I talked with them. 4. With regard to (b) the islanders state that the Sheikh never demanded tribute before last year. Is this true ? If we insist on the Sheikh asserting his rights over the island we can' hardly forbid him to exact tribute, though in view of the poverty of the islanders the sum should be little more than a nominal one. The correct answer, however, to the islanders probably is:- 'You are the subjects of the Sheikh and you must render to him v/hatever is due to him'. 5. I may be visiting the island again in April if as I hope I do another trip to Muscat in the ’Nearchue* then, and I should be grateful if before then you could let me know the facts,so far as you may be able to ascertain them and also let me have any comments or suggestions you may v/ish to make. 3d.

Reference to previous correspondence : Description of EnclosureGonfidential• I saw the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah on 23rd January regarding the points raised by the Hon^le the political Resident in his Confidential letter No•C/8 dated 9th January 1942 to you a copy of which 1 received for report with your Confidential Endorsemer •**r _ r-t T* O-..- O of continuing to assert his clalia to the Island but states that he does not get enough income from it even to pay for the expense of employing a special man whose duty would be to look after the hoist ing of the flag* This duty, he says, lias been entrusted to one of the Islanders by him and is generally performed* The Shaikh is always at pains to see that a flag is kept on the Island as soon as he learns that a new one is needed. My impression was that the flag hoisting is performed with the ordinary degree of care give to any routine duty in these parts. I impressed upon the Shaikh the imxjort ance of it* every year but no fixed amount and never an excessive amount. I believe this statement gives a fair representation of what happens* He also said that his son did levy an amount from some of the Island- ers who were acting at that time as storagt*; of goods being smuggled from the Coast to Persia* ITo.C/7C dated loth January 1942* 2* The denies that either he or his son have ever removed his flag from the Island of Tunb*He admits the importance 3* The Shaikh says that he does take tribute from the Islanders E.B.Wakefield Esquire,I.C.g., Political Agent, Bahrain*Confidential D. 0.

This may have been deliberate evasion, but is more probably a reflection of his own ignorance of detailed facts. 4. The mere fact that inquiries have been made about the flag and the levy of excessive tribute will probably be sufficient to ensure that the Shaikh is, in future, more careful about the former and more considerate about the latter# I will not, therefore, unless you instruct me to the contrary, pursue the matter further with the Shaikh# 5. As to the islanders, a reply to the effect that their increased '‘tribute' included a penalty for smuggling would not be untrue and might prove salutary.

I have discussed Vrith Colonel Hay the question of the flag on Tamb Island, to which the Government of India attach considerable importance. The Resident is likely to visit Tamb Island again in mid April on the 'Nearchus' and expects to see the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah^ flag flying there. I suggest that, if you see no objection, the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah should be informed of the Resident’s proposed visit and of his expectation that he will see the Has al Khaimah flag hoisted when the 'Ne&amp;rchus” is sighted. 3.

In 1933 Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, encouraged the shaikhs of the Trucial Coast to fly their flags on these islands to prevent the Government of Persia from claiming ownership. This led to a dispute between the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and the Ruler of Sharjah over the erection of buildings on the islands. This dispute had previously surfaced during the Residencies of Percy Zachariah Cox and Arthur Prescott Trevor.The file contains a note written by Khan Bahadur 'Isa bin 'Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Sharjah recording a conversation between Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi and Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent, Bahrain. Also discussed is the attempt by the Shaikh of Ras al-Khaimah to collect tribute from Persians living on Tamb Island.Correspondence is mainly between Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; Khan Bahadur 'Isa bin 'Abdul Latif, Residency Agent, Sharjah; Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi.
