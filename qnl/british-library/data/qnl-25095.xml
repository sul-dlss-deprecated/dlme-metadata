India Office, / January 1912. Sir, . , 1 am . directed b y the Secretary of State for India to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India regarding the situation created m Southern Persia by the attack on Mr. Vice-Consul Smart, and the measures necessitated thereby. . wou i cl seem ^at matters have now reached a point at which it is impossible to take action m any direction without raising the whole question of British policy m Persia. This is a question primarily for His Majestv’s Government, and it is subject to this consideration that the following remarks are offered. I am first to observe that what appears to be of pressing importance is the situation at Shiraz. Whatever may be done at Bushire in the way of anding troops and seizing the customs, what has to be faced is the probability that before the end of March Shiraz will be surrounded by 15,000 tribesmen in a lighting temper. The immediate objective of our policy must, therefore, be to prevent a contingency that threaten Shiraz, Ispahan, and lezd with a common disaster. The Government of India are rightly opposed to the despatch to Shiraz of a battalion of infantry and a mountain battery. The policy of sending small bodies of men through highly disturbed country—to the danger of which attention has more than once been called by this Office—has already been shown to be futile, and is largely responsible for the present situation. The alternative propo^ffi-by theTrovernment of India is^to send 5,000 men to ShirazMnJhWevent of its isolation ;^to bring away the detachments (ZmX. already the mylhe British Consul, and an y British subjects who may wish to Bushire with a ba ttalion until redress has~been' received) (h omlhe Persian Governmenj !r~Wssuming'lh^nim policy of His Government is still to maintain a strong and independent Persia, this proposal has much that at first sight is attractive and that might seem to counterbalance the grave disadvantages that must necessarily attend any withdrawal. But on examination it appears itself to be attended by disadvantages no less grave. In the first place it involves until Shiraz is actually in danger -before taking a measure which it will probably take two months to carry out. In the second place, it involves the occupation and partial administration of Bushire for an indefinite time. It would be impossible to send the British Consul back to Shiraz and to evacuate Bushire until the Persian Government had inflicted upon the tribesmen that condign punishment which the Government of India regard as a difficult and dangerous operation for 5,000 men of the Indian Army. The Persian Government, even if they had a free hand, The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. s. 127. / A S’i 1 I ^ Crwn^Ui ^ cAa* t*. l have not the means'of carrying this out within any reasonable time; p it is impossible to foresee what complications in the north might hinder them even in well-meant attempts to do so; and it is more^ than possible that they might, as on previous occasions, make the presence of foreign troops on Persian soil an excuse foi not attempting the task while the presence of a single battalion at a town on the coast, even coupled with control of the customs, would afford ns a minimum of leverage for moving them to efficient action. Moreover the eventual evacuation of Bushire on any terms short of complete satisfaction from the Persian Govern ment would itself bear the appearance of a defeat. Finally, it must he borne in mind that the question is not between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government alone. There are at Shiraz, Ispahan, and Yezd consular representatives and subjects of other Powers, including Russia; it is improbable that all of these would elect to withdraw with the British force ; and it is inconceivable that, if Great Britain showed herself unwilling or unable to protect them, Russia would fail to do so; His Majesty’s Govern ment would be in no position to protest; and with the appearance of Russian troops in a region which though nominally neutral, has, in fact, been accustomed only to British troops in the past, the whole policy of the !K&gt; would be very greatly affected. The alternative would appear to be the immediate occupation in force of Shiraz, and the effective control of the road to Bushire. How strongly the Secretary of State for India feels the objections to any such course is sufficiently indicated in this Office letter of 10t h October last. But th e situation has entirely changed since that date. is iicTImigerirTpiestioir of escorting caravans along the roads, but of ensuring the safety of British troops and subjects in Shiraz against overwhelming numbers, and of maintaining the prestige of this country in a sphere in which its influence has hitherto been predominant. With a brigade of infantry and a battery of mountain artillery at Shiraz, together with other troops sufficient to keep open their communications with Bushire, k4s-for- consideration whether we Mi on Id Wk he in a position to dictate both to the Persian Government and to the tribes the terms on which we would withdraw, and it would he worth their while not only to secure our withdrawal with the least possible delay, but to take such measures as would ensure that no similar occupation would ever lie necessary again. It is not suggested that this course is free from disadvantages. It would not be popular in Bio oountry ; it would be very expensive, though the cost of sending 5,000 men to Shiraz must in any case be great; there is the risk that so large a force at Shiraz might find itself drawn into punitive operations which should lie altogether outside its programme; and it is always possible that, as indicated above in connection with the occupation of Bushire, the Persian Government might profess to regard its presence as a reason for not negotiating at all. As regards the question of cost, I am to say that whichever course is adopted the consent of both Houses of Parliament will be necessary (under 21 &amp; 22 A ict., c. 100, s. 55) before any part] of the cost of “Military operations,” whether at Bushire or Shiraz, can he charged to Indian revenues; and I am to suggest that in view of the obvious unpopularity of such a charge, and of the consideration that the maintenance of the entente O' id l// ^ j |/f&gt; (/ / i ^ \A^ k-F i/ ^v. val)le tin,. tti*’ 1 18 %e opting th e ( coast, e?e n 3 with Russia has become a matter of European rather than of ^Asiatic importance, the whole of the cost should be borne by the Imperial exchequer.

Foreign Secret. Shiraz incident. My previous telegram of to-day. Senior Naval Officer is proceeding to Bushire with about 200 bluejackets and marines and 2o0 Native infantry ^ Jask, with one 7-pounder gun and four maxims. Native infantry will be landed at once, but (?) bluejackets will not be landed without further orders. Instructions have been given that no movement inland is to be made without express orders. This force should be sufficient for immediate protection of Bushire, but is quite inadequate for forcing passage to Shiraz. From Viceroy, 30th December 1911. Foreign Secret; Shiraz incident. The telegrams that have reached the Government of India from Shiraz and Bushire shew that what was foreseen as not unlikely has now happened, and that the detachments of Indian cavalry sent to Shiraz and Ispahan have been attacked by tribesmen with some loss (?) and that a force of 100 cavalry are in a precarious position at Kazerum. It is satisfactory to note that Consul Smart has only been wounded, and appears to be in safety in a caravanserai. Question now arises as to what action is to be taken. First, obvious suggestion is to land a battalion of infantry at Bushire to hold town in pledge until the Persian Government have taken effective measures to inflict condign punishment upon the tribesmen who attacked the British cavalry. The Customs should be seized and retained, and surplus over what is due for the service loans should be kept as a contribution towards claim to be made upon the Persian Government. Disembarkation of infantry would free ship now guarding the port, and would permit a blockade of coast which would create an uncomfortable situation for the tribesmen, and prevent their renewing their supplies of ammunition. This is very essential if^measures are to be taken, and we consider that the despatch of a battalion of infantry should be proceeded with at once. Question then arises as to whether any punitive measures should be undertaken against the offending tribes. Government of India consider that /measures would be ovont-ital-ly difficult and hazardous owing to elusive nature of tribes and to precipitous character of country. Moreover, they could only be undertaken by a large field force with a considerable amount of transport. There is, however, a further contingency which must be foreseen, viz., that even when the detachment at Nazeum has succeeded in returning to Shiraz, it is possible that main force at Shiraz will find itself in an entirely isolated position involving a certain amount of danger. It would then become necessary to relieve the detachment, and to effect this without running new risks a force of at least 5,000 men would be required consisting of four regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and two mountain batteries. Should the. Government of India be reluctantly compelled by force of circumstances, and in pursuit of a policy to which they have from the outset been opposed, to send a force of this size to relieve detachment of cavalry at Shiraz, they are strongly of opinion that force should return to the coast from Shiraz with the least possible delay, and should bring away with them the cavalry detachments from Ispahan and Shiraz, members of Consulate, and any British subjects who might desire to avail themselves of British troops as escort to leave Shiraz. Main body of troops could then return to India, and Bushire could be held by a battalion of infantry until satisfactory redress has been received from Persian Government. We are not in favour of sending a regiment of infantry and batteiy of artillery to Shiraz, since the despatch of this inadequate force would piesent risks that should be avoided. If, as we have proposed, a battalion of infantiy is to be despatched to Bushire, we should be glad of early orders.hi reply quota M Confidential. / am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit for the information of the Secretary of State for o f a telegram dated3 o ffceyphw of Teiegrom He.819 fpas the C&lt;»aand«r In Chief, officere end boi with thirty day* rations ami stores; Colonel Rows, * British Officers, 4 Indian, 8 Batiwe Surgeons, 160 rank and file, and 15» follcwp.

'A ThisJDoeument is the property of the Se of State for India Council. (Immediate.) Sir, India Office, 16th October 1911. In continuation of Mr. Abrahams’ letter P. 1639 of the 9th instant I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to address you on the’ subject of the scheme for the protection of caravans on the roads of Southern Persia, suggested by His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his telegram No. 401, of 14th September. The views of .the Government of India on this proposal were expressed in their telegram of the 30th September, copy of vdiich was enclosed in my letter above quoted, and have the entire concurrence of the Marquess of Crewe. In his Lordship’s opinion it would be quite impossible m practice to differentiate attacks upon travelling escorts of cavalry from attacks upon any other of His Majesty’s forces on foreign soil. That is to say, in the event of such attacks being made, it would be essential, for the purpose of maintaining the prestige in virtue of which alone such small bodies of men can safely move about the country at all, to undertake punitive measures against the tribes to which the assailants belong; and when once that process began, the consequences foreseen by the Government of India would surely follow. Ihose consequences Lord Crewe naturally regards mainly from the Indian point of view , and I am to say that alike on political, military, and financial grounds he is in the highest degree averse from taking any step that is likely to precipitate them. The present commotion in the Moslem world is reflected in the numerous appeals for the good offices of His Majesty’s Government in behalf of Turkey that have been received from Indian Moslems. And a military occupation of Southern Persia—or anything that could be misrepresented as such—following on recent events in Morocco and Tripoli would, in his Lordship’s opinion, have a deplorable political effect in India. Nor would the political effect of adopting the proposals be confined to the Moslems. As Sir E. Grey is perhaps aware, the military expen diture of the Indian Government is already an object of unfavourable criticism by important sections of Indian public opinion. The difficulty of rebutting such criticism will be greatly increased if it is seen that the Government of India are able to maintain even two regiments of cavalry for an indefinite time on foreign service, while it seems improbable that so small a force will long prove sufficient. But apart altogether from this political aspect of the question 1 am to say that neither the military nor the financial resources of India are such as to justify any material extension of Indian responsibilities at so great a distance from her frontier. The developments of Chinese policy The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 114. *on the north-east and east are already necessitating increased expen diture, and may not improbably involve some redistribution of the Indian Army upon those frontiers ; while a widespread disturbance on the north-western frontier—for which the existing acute antagonism between Moslem and Christian Powers is a predisposing condition— might at any moment call into action the full strength of the field army. And in this connection it should be mentioned that by 21 &amp; 22 Viet, c. 106, s. 55, the consent of both Houses of Parliament is required before the revenues of India can be applied to the conduct of military operations beyond its external frontier. These are the domestic considerations which lead Lord Crewe to view with apprehension the despatch of troops even for the protection of life, and which make it impossible for him (as at present advised) to recommend the Council of India to sanction the expenditure, or any part of it, involved in the adoption of Sir G. Barclay’s scheme. But there are two further considerations, arising from the state of Persia itself, which his Lordship wishes to submit to Sir E. Grey. It is not to be supposed that the occasional passage of an escorted caravan along the roads will of itself suffice to restore order in the country, noi is it proposed to use the troops directly for that purpose. But it is the now chronic disorder which, by destroying the purchasing power of the people and the credit of the merchants, and by driving Peaceful inhabitants into predatory habits, is far more damaging to British trade than the mere insecurity of the roads; and until it is lemoved, by measures which the Persian Government alone can take, his Lordship fears that any beneficial result that the introduction of Indian troops might have would be wholly incommensurate with the danger and the expense. hl C01idusl011 &gt; his Lordship feels strongly that the despatch of large hes et troops to Persia, contrary to the express wishes of the Govern- bodies ment, except for the actual protection of life, cannot be justified on anv grounds that would sat,sty reasonable public opinion in this country.

He is almost sure to be attacked again on the road upwards to Shiraz, and it is essential that before he starts passes and caravanserais should be properly secured. Force of fifty men sent out to hold the passes (see my telegram No. 742 [ ] ) is at Dashtarjen. Colonel Douglas leaves Shiraz at midday with 100 men to join the force at Dashtarjen, and will endeavour to extricate Birdwood. Nothing is definitely known of Smart. Acting consul reports that he is making every effort to find means, with the help of Kawam and Illkhani of the Kashgais, such as taking of hostages, to ensure safety of Douglas.

Tehran, December 27, 1911, 4*45 a.m. ACTING consul telegraphs that Kawam has telegraphed to Acting Governor of Kazerun ordering him on his life to see that no attacks are made on the troops in Kazerun and to provide them with all they require. Colonel Douglass will set out on 27th December with all available men for Kazerun, where position is extremely dangerous. Acting consul recommends that troops from Jask and any available naval forces should be brought to Bushire. I have authorised acting consul at Bushire to give effect to this recommendation. Casualties, besides Smart, missing, are 2 men killed, 7 wounded, and 2 missing. (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India.)Sir G.

MY telegram No. 745 [ Following is Colonel Douglas’s reply Tehran, December 26, 1911, 9*30 p.m. While desirous to avoid complicating political situation, it is impossible for me to allow my men to walk into a carefully-prepared trap on the supposition that the road guards are friendly. I think that situation would best be met by requiring the local authorities to withdraw their men when troops are passing through, and warning them that otherwise they might be mistaken for enemies. The only duties performed by these men is the extraction of blackmail from caravans, and if allowed to remain on the road they have to be watched to prevent interference with muleteers accompanying the troops. In the case of the party moving to-day through Tangi Turkan, I have asked Smart to assist officer commanding to discriminate, and Birdwood is accompanied by some of Mohammed Ali Khan’s men. This should prevent risk of mistake. I have just received information from the officer commanding party which left yesterday to operate with Birdwood on return journey that he was fired on at long range near Khanizinian.” (Addressed to Foreign Office ; sent to India.)CONFIDENTIAL. 27 DEC 1911 Sir G.

Fire was then opened on whole party from the tower and the [?] surrounding hills, and tufangchis had to [group undecypherable] from the tower and the hills cleared before they could proceed.

J:oN KIDKKTIAL. S?V G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 13, 11 p.m.) No. 489.) R. MY telegram No. 481 [ ]• Tehran, October 13, 1911, 3 p.m. Following is substance of reply of Persian Government:— Persian Government attribute ill-success of their special efforts [to restore order n Fars [? to] Kawam incident and his bast in British consulate. Subsequently nsurrection of ex-Shah, &amp;c , in suppression of which moral support of His Majesty’s representative was not forthcoming, diverted energies and [group undecypherable] resources of Persian Government. Now that the Government were free from embarrassments in the north and west md were about to direct their whole efforts to restoration of order and security in south, step contemplated by British Government, which might form a precedent for others, would be extremely unexpected on the part of a friendly Power. Steps enumerated as being taken by Persian Government are :— 1. Cossack detachment numbering 350 men, now at Kashan, will be ordered to proceed to Shiraz as soon as they have dealt with Naib Hussein (see my telegram No. 488 [ . ] )• 2. Ala-ed-Dowleh, with necessary force, wdll shortly leave Tehran for his new post. 3. Swedish officers are busily engaged on organisation of a gendarmerie. Their work will soon show a result, and a sufficient force for the protection of the southern roads will be dispatched. 4. Reconciliation of Soulet and Kawam, who have undertaken to obey absolutely orders of Government. Persian Government are confident in eventual success of these measures. In the meantime every measure will be taken for protection of British lives and property. In these circumstances Persian Government beg me to dissuade His Majesty’s Government from taking step contemplated, “ so that the Persian Government may have time to complete the measures they have undertaken, and that an uncalled-for step on the part of the British Government may not delay achievement of their plans.”Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 14, 4’3() p.m.) Tehran, October 14, 1911, 8*10 a.m. (No. 490.) YOUR telegram No. 304 [ Ala-ed-Dovvleh was, as reported in my telegram No. 455 [ 1, reluctantly proceeding. He has now «een pretext of contemplated dispatch of British’ troops, and tells me that he will not take up the post if they are sent. He tells me that he will go ii they are not, but I am not at all sure that in tha' event he would not find some other pretext for not going. The lawless force mentioned by Persian Minister consists partly of the Cossacks who are now engaged against Naib Hussein (see my telegram No- 488 [ ]), and it is doubtful if the Russian colonel will allow them to go so far into our field without the two Russian officers who are now with them, and I do not know that presence of Russian officers at Shiraz would be welcome to us. Cossacks, I understand, a force of ordinary Persian soldiers, will accompany him, but past experience shows that such a force melts away at Shiraz. Persian Government have made a great point to me of the agreement between Kawam and Soulet, but Ala-ed-Dowleh scoffs at the idea of a reconciliation. Following is Acting Consul [group undecypherable] in his telegram No. 350 “ Some ten days ago Kawam signed document sealed already by Soulet, and subsequently by Mirza [group undecypherable] in which it was chiefly stipulated that [groups omitted] ruling of the Persian Government in the matter of the Governor- General, and dismissed their forces immediately, that Soulet should protect Bushire road, and both sides restore looted property. Kawam attached no importance to document which was signed in no [group undecypherable], and of which he did not even keep duplicate, signature being only intended by both parties as a demonstration of public spirit. Needless to say none of its conditions have been observed, and it cannot conceivably affect general situation. “ So small significance was at the time attributed to this document that it did not previously occur to me that it could be looked on in the light of a settlement.” Acting consul also reports that Kawam is constantly telegraphing to Prime Minister to dismiss Soulet from chieftainship of the tribe, and that Soulet is actively intriguing against Kawam. I cannot, therefore, but be a little sceptical as to any real settlement. Undoubtedly situation at Shiraz has improved for the moment, since despatch of British troops was decided on, and if this measure depends solely on the situation in the town, improvement which has already occurred, and the apparent prospect of further improvement if Ala-ed-Dowleh proceeds, warrant perhaps our postponing the dispatch. If, therefore, as I infer from your telegram No. 299 [ ' ] 5 state of roads is to be ignored, we might tell Persian Government that we will defer sending troops for a week, but that these will then leave for Shiraz unless Ala-ed- Dowleh is on his way to his post. State of roads is, moreover, truly desperate, and no real improvement is likely until a proper gendarmerie is organised, and this is remote. Besides beating of Miss Ross reported yesterday, large robbery of British property is reported Rom Bunder Abbas, and last news from Kerman roads to Bunder Abbas is that none is passable, and conditions are worse than consul has known them. Following are two telegrams received from acting consul at Shiraz, No. 346, and consul-general at Bushire, No. 261, yesterday :— All telegraph lines to Bushire have been totally interrupted for last forty Another gholam sent out to investigate was robbed of everything and severely 972—1931 R. hours. &gt;&lt;jgmmm beaten. Loss of tooJs and telephones in possession of robbers is causing inconvenience to department.

He continues that governor must at all costs oppose t? 186 and should raise khans on the road and in Tangistan against them, and that A ^ estates are forfeited to the Government, and should be taken possession of. letkn 1118 above lines can only result in continued and violent disorder on road.” Bushire telegram then recapitulates a series of outrages on telegraph employesCONFIDENTIAL.

After the end of November winter supervenes, and road will be impracticable for 300 men, owing to lack of supplies, and unless those required for winter here are laid in immediately, it will be impossible to ensure feeding men and horses, as there is little doubt that there will shortly be a famine. “ Moreover, the situation is still very strained, and general disorder on the roads, I think, is imminent. Further trouble in town may also arise out of incident of this afternoon, when inhabitants of suburb fired on Kawam on his way from consulate, and killed some of his men. “(Repeated to Bushire).” Do you approve of the following wording for my announcement to Persian Govern ment ?— (R.) “ In consequence of the general disorder prevailing in Southern Persia, His Majesty’s Government have decided to increase the British consular escorts at places where British trade interests require temporary protection. “ These escorts will be occasionally employed for protection of British [?] caravans [?].

FarmanFarma has made difficulties about proceeding to Shiraz, and Ala-ed-Dowleh has been appointed. Kawam has been appointed deputy governor, and has left consulate. Kawam assures acting consul that he will immediately send his son in charge of most disorderly tribesmen to a distance of 50 miles from Shiraz, retaining only those on whom he can rely. Cox, who I gather has been consulted by the Grovernment of India, has telegraphed strongly urging the immediate dispatch of troops in the interest of security of British subjects and merchandise both in Shiraz and on trade routes. He says exit of Kawam relieves anxiety for safety of the consulate, but it cannot be supposed that order and security in Shiraz will ensue. Soulet and Nizam have retired a few miles solely as the result of our definite threat and of reports of our preparations to make it good. Even if Nizam disappeared from Fars, Soulet is not likely to resign himself quietly to effacement, and failure on our part to carry out intentions now generally known will greatly encourage forces of disorder and the revival of damaging impression that there is no fear of our executing our intentions.

Aide-memoire received from Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that Russian Government appreciate reasons for proposed measures and have no objection to proposed increase of British consular escort at Ispahan. Russian Government, on their part, are preoccupied by general insecurity prevailing not only in the region between Tehran and Ispahan, but also in North Persia, where there is a renewal of disorders. They would now not send troops as in 1909 unless absolutely compelled, but will probably have to strengthen escorts at some of their consulates in the north, as also at Ispahan, in order to protect communications and Russian commerce between that town and Tehran and Shiraz respectively.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 2, 11 p.m.) ^ Tehran, October 2, 1911, 10 p.m. FOLLOWING from consular ollicer at Shiraz, No. 330:— “ Situation is becoming more and more serious. Soulet and Nizam are growing despeiate, and former is talking freely to his intimates of attacking consulate. Meanwhile, Arabs, who for years past have been out of all control, are rapidly realising that they have nothing to hope or fear from a Government each of whose decisions is cancelled on the morrow, and are not unlikely to effect a settlement agreeable to themselves by the general pihage of Shiraz. I his possibility is reluctantly admitted even by karguzar. All Peisian merchants are in a state of panic. Imperial Bank of Persia is faced by most serious position from shortage of cash, and Europeans in general are growing hourly more nervous, as may well be expected with some 5,000 armed savages in possession of town. “ lor the past seven weeks I have persistently endeavoured to draw attention of His Majesty’s Government to the dangers of the situation in Shiraz, and I now find myself in the position of being unable to afford any semblance of adequate protection to the property or even lives of British subjects, which are at present certainly not exempt from danger. I think that tension may be still in some degree relaxed if I may before this evening give the warning suggested in my telegram No. 298 to Soulet, and impress equally strongly on the Arab chiefs the extent of their responsibilities as regards British lives and property. In any case dispatch of the 300 men is a matter of urgent necessity. “(Repeated to Bushire.)” I have replied as follows :— (R.) “ Your telegram No. 330. “ You can tell Soulet from me that, unless he immediately removes himself and his men from neighbourhood, I shall recommend my Government to take immediate steps to protect our interests, and to visit the penalty for any damage to these directly upon himself and Nizam. You can also warn Arab chiefs that I shall recommend my Government to take steps to exact full reparation for any harm to British lives and property.” I have also drawn attention of Persian Government to menacing situation, and urged them to warn the various chiefs of the necessity of preventing harm to British subjects.

You should inform Russian Government at once that we may find it necessary to establish a vice-consulate at Bam with adequate escort, and to strengthen our consular escorts at Bushire, Shiraz, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas; also at Ispahan. We hope that they will not object to this last, which is within their sphere. The only object of the step is to protect British trade in the south, which has suffered such heavy losses, and this is the least that we can do, as we wish to avoid any military occupation in the south, which would entail sending a large body of troops. The inclusion of Ispahan in the scheme is necessary to its efficacy. The escorts would be 200 additional men at Shiraz and Bam and an increase of 100 men at the other towns above mentioned.

Grey to transmit to you to be laid before tiie Secretary of State for India the accompanying decypher of a telegram from His Majesty's Minister at Tehran in which he suggests a scheme for endeavouring to put an end to the state of anarchy now prevailing on the roads in Persia. In view of the probable long delay in the organisation ° f an 611 icient gendarmerie force for the protection of the Southern trade routes and having regard to the increasing anarchy in Persia, Sir E. Grey is disposed to think that Sir G. Barclay's proposal for the employment of materially strengthened consular guards as caravan escorts, is worthy oi the most serious consideration, and he would be glad to learn as soon as possible the views of the Secretary of m IP ! a Under Secretary of State, India Office.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 14, 1O30 p.m.) i ^ Tehran, September 14, 1911, 6*20 p.m. YOLjR telegram No. 253 [ ]. Persian Government already subsidise certain local chiefs for purpose but the result is not satisfactory, and subsidisation would, I think, be only practicable and effective as part of a road scheme run by British officers. I regret that I can suggest no temporary measure, pending the organisation of road guards or of a gendarmerie which would give a prospect of material improvement except one which would involve employment of British troops in some form. Attitude of Russia towards appointment of Major Stokes renders more remote organisation of gendarmerie fitted to the requirements of our trade, and even if money is obtained by Persian Government without the assistance of Major Stokes it must be many months before anything effective is ready. Even our own scheme of road guards, which, now that the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road has to be dealt with—I exclude Bakhtiari road, as the Bakhtiari should be able to maintain order on it when not occupied against ex-Shah—would have to be of a more extensive nature than originally intended, and could not be effective for at least six months from the time when the officers got to work. Moreover, I do not believe that anything short of a threat—which might have to be carried out—of occupation by our noops would suffice to compel Persian Government to accept the scheme, and furthermore, Persian Government now obtain nothing from revenues of Fars on which we counted for greater part of cost. „„ t - p® Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire suggests, in a private telegram to me, action on the following lines which would be fully warranted on grounds of the pievai mg anarchy, and would effect immediate improvement without constituting mtervention and without offering the prospect of those far-reacliing consequences winch would result from occupation of roads by our troops: to increase the mounted escorts at Ispahan, Bushire, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas by 100 men each that at Muraz by 200 men, and to establish vice-consulate at Bam with an escort of 200 men each escoit to be propeily officered—-and to use these escorts in parties up to fifty men or escorting occasional organised Bnti_sh caravans. We could warn khans and kibes trad? “ &lt; | s , that , w ® ha , d , ¥ en , dl y en to Am measure by the continued insecuritv for trade, and hoped tor their friendly co-operation, while, on the other hand if we experienced hostility or irregularity from them our arrangements would become more ;3 he — As f ’ 0011 as gendarmerie showed itself effective we could reduce our I think scheme offers the best hope of early improvement short of the occunation h roads by our troops although the possibility of the escorts incurring bloody feuds with robber tribes and of the consequent necessity of punitive measures must be faced if the scheme is adopted. I presume Russia would have no objection to increase of 1 Ispahan guards if it were made clear to her that they would not J u ind that if complaints of activity of escorts being confined to British caravans wire to own risk W6 ^ aiTaUge that f ° reigI1 g00ds sll0uld accompany them at their (Addressed to Foreign Office ; repeated to Bushire, Ispahan, Shiraz, and Kerman.)Consulate.

I am to state that a copy of your letter of March 16uU last, expressing Lord Morley's xiope that it would be possible to withdraw altogether the Indian detachment at Shiraz, was duly communicated to Sir Gr.

When it is relieved I propose to take an opportunity of sending the naval officer and five marines now at Shiraz back to Bushire (see your telegram No. 44). I see, however, no early prospect of being able to dispense with Indian infantry detachment, which was sent up at the same time as the marines July last year. But the foreign service period of men who compose it has expired, and they should*there fore be relieved at the same time as the escort. I think it important that the Maxim (see my telegram No. 735, last year) should he retained, and, if the Admiralty consent to this, that relieving detachment should include Maxim crew from the Indian army. \ [754—11FOREIGN OFFICE, September S* 1910. .304/10). £ With reference to your letter of June 9th rela tive to the maintenance of the escort of His Maj esty’s Consulate at Shiran at its present increased strength, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Tehran, on the suoject of the advisability of continuing the present arrangement beyond the end of this year.

Tf Sphinx M , in command of the maxim detachment at Shiraz. 2. I was in communication with Lieut: Lan^ on the tele graph line shortly before leaving hushire on the 16th when all ’'as well *'ith the party and there had been no further disturbances. Another Governor General, Saham-ed-Dowleh, was reported to have been appointed instead of Ain-ed-Oowleh and the Kashkais were said to be drawing off. As mentioned in previous reports H.M. Minister at Teheran wishes the reinforcements to remain until a new Governor actually arrives at Shiraz and there is as yet no information as to when this will be. 3. The party have been placed on compensation and I arranged for the sum of £30, public money, to be deposived at the Shiraz branch of the Bank of Persia in Lieutenant Lang's name to meet expenses for food and advance payments to the men. Lieutenant Lang has been directed to keep an account of all disbursements and to withdraw the balance from the bank at Bushire on his return.'f 4* Arrangements will be made for the party to be met at Bushiro by w Redbraast n or T, SJhinx w * 5. As my relief is due within a few days I shall be unable to personally forward Lieutenant Lang's further and final reports after his return to the ship. Under these eireumstanees I beg to be allowed to ta^e this opportunity of submitting Lieutenant Lang's services to your favourable notice. I am confident that he and his men will complete this service in a manner which will bring credit to themselves and to H.M.Mavy. The journey at this time of the year against time must have been a very trying one. ^om other sources I hear that the arrival of the gun had a very good moral effect. Ihavo # etc.. (Sgd.) Shirley Litchfield, Commander % Senior Maval Offieer Persian OnIf.i Consulate, Shiraz, 7th August 1909 Sir, I have the honour to report that in accordance ^ith your order to proceed to Shiraz in command of a Maxim gun and detachment consisting of 1 N. C # 0. &amp; 3 Privates and 1 Armourer's Mate, the detachment left 'Sphinx' at 6 # 15 p,m. on Sunday R5th July and landed at the cable house Reshire. The mules (IP in number) arrived about 7.30 and as soon as they had been loaded the detachment proceeded to Reshire Telegraph Office and ’vere joined by a party of Sepoys belonging to the UOth Mahratta Regiment '?ho formed the guard there. The party then proceeded to the Residency Subzabad and there joined up ’vith the remainder of the force. The total force under the command of Captain Crosthwait, I.A. Pnd. assistant to the Resident, consibt# ing of 1 Native Officer and 36 Sepoys, 110th Regiment, and 5 Solars, IPth Cavalry, ^ith the Maxim gun detachment from H.M.S.'Sphinx', left Subzabad at 11.15 p.m. for Ahmedi the first stage P5 miles distant. Ahmedi was reached at 6.15 a.m. on the P6th and we stayed at the Caravanserai for the day. The caravanserai at Ahmedi is a medium sized building with a square courtyard, fairly clean but there is practically■MM praotioally no ^ater for drinking purposes. The heat during the day ’vas intense. Leaving Ahmodi at 6.0 p.m. we proeedded to Boraziun (B50 feet 16 miles). Arriving here at 12.30 a.m. we found the caravanserai doors closed, and the tofangohis refused to open them. We used threats but with no result and were con sidering what steps to take when the telegraph official arrived and informed us that the Khan had given orders that wo .fere not to be allowed to use the caravanserai. The whole force was therefore accommodated in the telegraph buildings and garden. The water here is good especially that procured from a well in the village. Supplies in the way of food are plentiful. Shortly before leaving next afternoon one Sepoy went down with heat stroke and one with dysentery. They were left behind a.nd ultimately recovered. Leaving Boraziun at 6.0 p.m. on the 27th we proceeded to Daliki (400 feet, 16 miles) and reached there at 10.30 p.m. and after resting there for £ hour we pro ceeded on foot to Konar Takhteh (1850 feet, 16 miles). The latter part of this march was very trying as it included the ascent of the Kotal-i-Malu, or T, The Accursed Pass”, which is 1980 feet high. The actual ascent involves a rise in elevation of over 1000 feet and occupied nearlynearly 3 hours lhe latter part of this march 'vas carried out after sunrise and Konar Takhteh was not reached until 9 a.m. on the 88th, /e put up in the telegraph rest house. Supplies are ^ood, but water scarce. In the afternoon two Sepoys died from heat stroke and were buried outside the rest-house garden wall. The march was continued at midnight for Kanarig V (8950 feet, 13 miles). The caravanserai we intended to stay in was 3 miles further on. We intended to stay at the new caravanserai but our charvadars misled us as to the accommodation and water supply which we discovered on arrival to be bad, and non- existant respectively. It was clearly impossible to stay there so we decided tather than retrace our steps to Karriarig village to pish on to Rahdur situated some 7 miles further on. We reached Rahdur at 9,30 a,m,, and stayed there in the serai which though dirty was cool, and water supply veiv good. We left Rahdur at 5,0 p.m, for Kazarun (8950 feet 11 miles). About 4 miles from Rahdur some shots were fired at, or in the direction of the caravan. The charvadars at once halted but the caravan was ordered to proceed the Marines and Sepoys dismounting and preparingproparinfc for an attack. Aa nothin# happened the foroe remounted. it 'ras presumed that the firin# was an attempt by the road guard to stop the caravan and demand money. Kaaarun was reached without further incident at 9 - 3 0 P** 11 * Toroo put up in the Bagh—i-Nasser. Pood and water supplies very good. The detachment marched at 4 p.m. on the 30th for Plan Kotal (5800 feet 31 mijes), and crossed Pul-i-Abgineh (8 miles distant) .lust before sunset. f rhe force dismounted and an advance guardhaving been sent out, the Marines with the maxim headed the caravan. The top of the Kotal-i-Dukhter was reached after about 3 hours marching, and a halt was made at the Ab-Amber about 3 miles further on in order to let the caravan close up. The march was resumed at 11 p.m. and the serai at Mian was reached at 1.30 a.m. The door was found locked but by climbing the wall we managed to pick the padlock from the inside and so gain an entrance. Serai fair. ] o supplies: very little water. Leaving Mian Kotal at 3.30 p.m. 31st July we marched to Oasht-i-Ar.iin (6600 feet 13 miles) the Marines and a party of Sepoys forming the advance guard. The ascent of the Kotal-i-Pir Zan (7400 feet) was accomplished by 5.0 p.m. and the advance guard arrived at the top of the descent to Dasht-i-Ar.1in at 5.30 p.m. Whilst halted here for the caravan to close up oneone of the ehervedars gave the alarm of thieves and some shots Tero fired. The advance guard elimbed up a hill commanding the road but the thieves had made good their escape in the ffhiok scrub* It subsequently transpired that the thieves had stolen a mule laden with telegraph insulators belonging to the Indo-European telegraph department whioh had attached itself to our oaravan but was isolated from it, having strayed from the road. Without further incident Dasht-i-Arqin was reached at 9.30 p.m. and a halt made for half an hour, when the march was resumed to Khan-i-Zinian(6300 feet 11 miles) which was reached at 1.30 a.m. 1st August. The caravanserai here is fairly clean and food and water supplies very good and plentiful. We remained here all day in order to prepare Lue men for the last two stages as in the event of our march being opposed they would have to dismount and proceed on foot. We marched at 11.30 p.m. (1st) for Chinar Rahdar (5200 feet 20 miles) which was reached without incident at 7.30 a.m. 2nd August. The seouting on this march was performed by the Sowars about a mile in advance of the caravan. A party of Soulets tofangchis wore observed about 14 miles from Chinar Rahdar but made off on our approach.At Chtnar ^ahlar -to -Taro mot by H.B.M's Consul at Shiraz (Mr.Bill) who was aooompanioh by tha principal British re^iionts* A 3hort halt ’»ras mado, and tho rnaroh resumed, Shiraz CMbitalate being reaehed at 10.0 a.m. The arrival of the detachment did not appear w st arouse any interest amon^ the natives.

Since our arrival we have been planning defences for the Consulate and carrying out what work is necessary in connection therewith.

[1848 fc—5] Sir, Foreign Office, July 10, 1908. BY your letter of the 13th January last you conveyed to Secretary Sir Edward Grey the consent of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to the charge to Imperial funds of half the additional cost involved by the retention at His Majesty’s Consulate at Shiraz, for a period of six months, of the escort due for relief on the arrival of the reliefs, whereby the guard of that Consulate was temporarily doubled. The date on which the reliefs reached Shiraz was the 19th December, 1907, and the period of six months, which must be reckoned from that day, consequently expired on the 19th ultimo, and the question has now arisen as to whether the retention of the increased escort for a further period of six months is necessary for the protection of His Majesty’s Consulate. I am to state that, in Sir E. Grey’s opinion, in view of the disturbed condition of Persia in general, and, in particular, of the departure from Shiraz of the present Governordleneral, Zil-es-Sultan, who is one of the few Persian officials capable of maintaining order in the territory under his jurisdiction, it is extremely desirable that the escort should be maintained at its present strength, and I am to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will see their way to accord their sanction to this arrangement on the same terms as on the last occasion. I am at the same time to transmit, for their Lordships’ consideration, copies of correspondence on the subject,* showing that Sir E. Grey’s opinion is shared by the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and His Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Bepresentatives on the spot. I am, &amp;c.

With reference to your letter of the 7th in- ^ stant relative to the retention of the increased Con- $ sular escort at Shiraz, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty^ Charge d*Affaires at Tehran urging the desirability of this measure. I am to request that you will call the attention of Viscount Morley to the last paragraph of this des patch in which Mr. Marling supports a suggestion put forward by Mr. Graham, till lately His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, that a small number of spare rifles should be kept at His Majesty’s Consulate in accord ance with the arrangement already in force at His Majesty's Legation at Tehran. to state that Sir E.

Your most obedient. humble Servant,3opy. (0,153. (23128) 0 I .c glr:- G U L A H E K, , June 17th, 1908. (M) X?' In accordance with the sanction conveyed to rae in your telegram No.39 of February 25th last, the increased escort attached to His Majesty's Consulate at Shiraz was retained for six months. That period has now elapsed and I have received a despatch from his Majesty's Acting Consul at that place Inquiring whether any decision has been arrived at in regard to the question of permanently increasing tne escort of the Consulate from six to twelve men. Though the retention of the time expired party of men was authorised pending an improvement in the affairs of Fare, and there is reason to hope that such ah Iraprovanent mas- as a result, ot the appolnt- rneut ot His Imperial Hl^nass the m-es-sultan as . nf the province, be maintained, Governor General of , •, hi fhness’ tenure of the post is, as is His Imperial Highness r over nor In Persia, very precarious, that of every Governor and Sir Edward Grey, Bart., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp; c •and his removal would inevitably be the occasion of an outburst of fresh disorders throughout the Pro vince . I venture therefore to support Mr .Bill in the opinion which he has expressed, and in which more over he had the entire concurrence of Mr. Grahame, that the situation in Shiraz still contains the elements of those dangers, the active manifestation of which caused the retention of the present escort to be sanctioned, and consequently demands the ^ presence of a larger escort than was formerly the case. It is, however, desirable, and in the case of one of the men who is ill, urgent, that the time ex pired men should be relieved and though I should re gret their withdrawal from Shiraz until arrangements have been made to replace them, I venture to request that the question of their return to India and of re placing them by a fresh contingent may be taken Into consideration and If possible settled at an early date. I must add that Mr. Grahams on his way through Tehran(g) Tehran mentioned to me the desirability of a small number ot spare rifles be Hog kept in the Consulate for the use of the British Colony in case of emer gency and suggested that the relieved escort might leave their rifles behind them upon their departure. The Legation here is provided with a snail number of rUles for this purpose, and I venture to submit for your favourable consideration that a similar ar rangement in the case of Shiraz would be a prudent ^ precaution. .

Acting Consul at Shiraz inquires whether, in view of dismissal of Zil-es-Sultan and certainty of disorders in province under new Governor, he may consider retention of detachment as sanctioned, and may purchase six horses for them. I am convinced that disorders will break out again on departure of Zil-es-Sultan, especially as Governor designate was on a former occasion entirely incompetent. In these circumstances, I think it would be prudent to sanction retention. * *CONFIDENTIAL. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling (Tehran). f~ I o (No. 39.)

CONFIDENTIAL. r\ Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 5, 4 p.m.) (No. 327.) Tehran, November 5, 1907, 10'] 0 a.m. FOE, some days past situation at Shiraz has been disquieting, and there has been frequent shooting. A considerable number of Kashgai tribesmen are in and about town. His Majesty’s Consul now telegraphs, under date of 3rd November, as follows :— &lt;f Shiraz situation. £&lt; German subject informs me, though armed, mounted, and accompanied by servant, he was attacked this morning on high road, within a mile of Shiraz, by four armed [? group omitted] robbers, who literally stripped him. Details telegraphed to German Minister. For some days there has been vague feeling until Europeans suffer no attention will be paid to Shiraz situation. In my opinion local authorities are quite unable to protect Europeans here. I would urge advisability of at once dispatching from Bushire to Shiraz as many sowars as can be spared. Shiraz reliefs timed to arrive Bushire 6th November should follow as soon as possible.” I have made urgent representations to Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I doubt power of Persian Government to take effective measures. I would suggest that relieved escort remain until situation is calmer; escort will thus be brought up by reliefs to twelve men. In case situation becomes more threatening, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire might be instructed to hold twenty-five or thirty of his nativ e infantry in readiness to leave for Shiraz. They would take six days to reach Bushire [? Shiraz]. Unrest is growing all over the country. Near Asterabad Persian Turcomans are committing serious excesses, and Government has been able to do nothing.
