Watson received his B.A. from Princeton University, then studied at Ohio State and Lawrenceville before receiving a degree in divinity from the Princeton Theological Seminary. After finishing his studies, Watson worked at a mission in Pittsburgh and pastored a church in St. Louis. In 1902 he was called upon by the United Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions to direct its overseas activities in India and the Middle East. He cultivated an association with the Hill family, who eventually made possible the American University in Cairo through their generous contributions. Watson served as AUC president from 1919 until 1944. </dc:description><dc:subject>presidents; administrators</dc:subject><dc:subject>Watson, Charles R.
