WALTON, ESQ., C.3., M.C.'24/^5 2 • &amp; A meeting was held in the Colonial Office on September 13th. to discuss the question of the undertakings ;i ven to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah regarding their date gardens at Basrah. The following were present:- Sir Francis Humphrys. Mr. J.E.W. Flood. ) Mr. J.H.Hall. ) Colonial Office. Mr.F.J .Pedler. ) Mr. W.R.L. Tr icicett. Treasury. Mr. G.W.Rendel. ) . ^ \ Foreign Office. Mr. W.B.Beckett. ) Mr. J.C.Walton. ' India Office. 2. Mr.Flood recalled that the Iraqi a-ovci_, e- t had recently altered its system of taxation on agricultural products so that taxation was now leviec ci such parts of the crop as were sold or exported , and .xoc upon the lend itself. The Treasury took the view that the new tax (the istihlak tex) was nox cover-- undertaking given in 1914 to the Sheix.is, v.-io haa, therefore, no claim that, in allo.'in^ t~is tax uo ue levied upon the produce of their date ^-rc.e^c, His Majesty^ Government was 'breaking faitn. Tne Goverrinieno of India and the India Office held the opposite opinxon that the istihlak tax was covered 'by the please, and that if the Sheikhs were compelled to pay it they should receive full financial compensation, and apparently tne Government of India took the extreme view that the Sheikhs should be guaranteed in perpetuity against all taxation on the lands or the produce thereof, a position which could hardly be sustained seriously as such a pro. deev! was totally impossilDle of fulfilment. It would 'be noted, moreover, that the suggestion was made that if any payment was to 'be mrde. His Majesty's Government should bear it, India not contributing one stiver. The Le ^al Position. 3. Sir Francis Humphrys said it was important to bear in mind what were the intentions of the officers who gave the undertaking to the Sheikhs. They were servants of the Government of India and, as such, were well acquainted with the grants of immunity from taxation known in India as 'jagirs'. There are other jagirs in Iraq, e.q., that of the Naqib. None of the holders of these jagirs receives any privilege under the istihlak law: in point of fact everybody now has a jagir. It was quite certain that the Sheikh of Koweit knew that something had happened which seriously weakened his case. Sir Francis warned the meeting against supposing that the istihlak tax was merely a different machinery for taking the same amount. It was estimated that the Iraqi Government would in fact lose some 25 lakhs by the change. If the Sheikhs or their dependants consumed the dates in Basrah they need pay no tax whatsoever . In his opinion, therefore, the Sheikhs had no legal cla.im to compensation. 4. Mr.Beckett took the same view. He felt strongly that the undertakings of 1914, the texts of which were before the meeting, could not legally be held to apply to a tax of the present type, even if it should happen that the effect of the tax in practice was much the same as that of a Irnd tax. Indeed, if it were held that the 1914 undertaldnfe were intended to give the Sheikhs exemption from future taxation on the sale or export of the produce of their gardens/gardens, it could equally be argued that its effect would be to give them exemption from, say, British or American import duties, which would obviously be absurd. He felt, therefore, that, speaking from the purely legal point of view, the undertakings of 1914 put us under no obligation either to secure the exemption of the Sheikhs frcm the operation of the istihlak tax or to pay them compensation for its imposition. 5. Mr.Beckett pointed out that even though there might be no legpl liability so long as Iraq retained the istihlak system, it was possible that a land tax might be reintroduced, in which case the legal liability would once more arise. It was, therefore, important that any payment now made should be in final liquidation of all the 1914 undertakings, so that they might not a^galn be invoked in any eventuality. 6. Mr.Trickett agreed, saying that he had previously advanced the view that under the law as it now stood there was no present liability arising out of the undertaking, and therefore no case for a present payment to the Sheichs. The Treasury could not agree to relieve the Sheikhs o: a tax in the nature of an excise or export duty. The Treasury quite agreed however that if any payment were to be made on any ground, it should be made in full and final satisfaction of all cla,ims present and future. 7. Mr.Walt on explained that the Government of India, the Political Resident and the India Office were interested in obtaining a fair settlement for the Sheikh c Koweit, largely because of the political reactions in the/X the Gulf of any real or apparent failure to implement the 1914 pledge. Their view was that compensation ought to 'be paicl irrespective Of the strict legal position (though this r .iight affect the amount of such compensation), on account of the moral obligation and for the sake of preserving the British reputation for reliability in the Gulf, where the pledge to secure immunity from taxation for the Sheikh 1 s date gardens, was widely known, and where it would 'be held that the faith of Great Britain was involved in irnple lenting it adequately. 8. It was generally agreed that steps ought to 'be taken to secure the payment to the Sheikhs of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of the 1914 undertakings. Mr.Trickett added that he did not think the Treasury would dissent from the conclusion, provided the payments could be assessed within reasonably narrow limits and the Government of India were prepared to participate. ount of C ompensati on. 9. The question of how the amount of this compensation should be arrived at had previously been ' discussed. It was agreed that it would be necessary in the first place to attempt to form some estimate of the extent to which the Sheikhs would be out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the new tax. This calculation would not be easy as much depended on how the produce was disposed of and on the quality of the dates. The Sheikhs would no doubt exaggerate both the quantity and the quality in the hope of obtaining larger compensation. Sir Prancis Humphrys said that he thought the calculation could be made by means of a joint investigation ty/^ \i^ by Mr.Jardine, the Administrative Inspector at Basrah, and the British Consul. It was agreed that the Departments should 'be guided by Sir Francis Humphrys 1 advice in this matter after his return to Baghdad, -..r..^lood / . x pointed out that the Resident, in para.^aph 6 (2) of -is despatch of the 16th of August, had undertaken to secure frcrn the Sheikh of Koweit the details necessary for the making of this estimate, in so far as the gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit were concerned. 10. It was agreed that when this calculation should be available, a figure should be worked out which -is rajesty's Government would regard as fair and adequate compensation for the two Sheikhs, and that this figure should not be allowed to form the subject of discussion or negotiation with the Sheikhs (vide paragraph 20). Contribution by the Iraqi Govermient. 11. Sir Francis Humphrys said he had always thought it would be fair for Iraq to contribute a share of about one-third of the amount of compensation ultimately decided upon, at any rate in so far as the Sheikh of Koweit was concerned. He had discussed the matter with ITuri Pasha, Y/ho was agreeable to pay a su~i of about £1,500 per annum. It was, however, quite out of the question for the Iraqi Government to secure the necessary Parliamentary authorisation to concede this sum in the form of exemption from taxation or in the form of a refund of taxa.tion. l\ T uri Pasha had accordingly suggested that an annual payment might be made to the Sheikh, noninally for the purpose of enabling him to check the extensive smuggling which at present goes on. It could be explained privately to the Sheikh/Sheikh that this was in fact compensation in connection with the 1914 undertakings, but the matter would have to 'be delicately handled as this aspect of the question could not 'be publicly stated in Iraq. Mr.'Jalton pointed out that the Resident foresaw probable objection on the part of the Sheikh to a 'subsidy' in connexion with smuggling, and asked whether this sum could not be paid as a contribution to His Majesty's Government to assist tlem in discharging their liability to the Shei^chs. Sir Francis explained that this proposal would raise in an acute form the question of whether the legal liability lay upon Great Britain or Iraq. Whenever this question was raised the Iraqis took the view that, if the liability was legally theirs they would meet it iii tot o , but that before they would do this the legal position must be settled by an arbitral award. 12. Sir Francis emphasised that the settlement between Iraq and Koweit must be direct. Intervention by His Majesty's Government would not be likely to facilitate the negotiations. Mr.Walt on pointed out that the proposal for an Iraq-Koweit agreement would require careful handling, and the Sheikh would of course be advised by the Political authorities in the Gulf. Arbitrati on. 13. Mr.Walt on enquired what were the objections to arbitration between His Majesty's Government and Iraq to determine upon which country the liability rested. It was explained that the main objection in the past had been that the result of arbitration would be very douotful, and that if His Majesty's Government lost they would be faced/faced with a heavy and clear liability, for the payment of which it would be very difficult to obtain Parliamentary sanction. Since the introduction of the istihlak tax, however, there appeared to be no possibility of achieving a satisfactory solution by arbitration, since an arbitrator would almost certainly take the view that the istihlak tax was not covered by the undertaking given to the Sheikhs, end that consequently no liability rested upon either Great Britain or Iraq. Sir Francis added that even if an arbitrator decided that the liability lay on Iraq, although the Iraqi Government would probably observe scrupulously the letter of the award, they would find seme means of reimbursing themselves at the Sheikhs' expense or at all events of seeing that the Sheikhs did rot gain on the balance. 14. It was agreed that the proposal to put the matter to arbitration between His Majesty's Government and Iraq should be abandoned except in the remote contingency of it being decided that the istihlak tax was covered by the undertaking, and that even in this case arbitration could not effect a satisfactory final settlement for the reason stated in the preceding paragrajh Source of propo s ed pa-Ament . 15. Mr.Trickett stated that his instructions were still to the effect that any payment made to the Sheikhs must be shared between the United Kingdom Government and the Government of India. The Treasury were not satisfied however that any legal liability existed, and had never committed themselves to pay anything except in response to a legal liability to pay. They did not admit that even then the whole liability should fall upon His Majesty^ Government. The India Office on the other hand/■ hand held that compensation must be paid irrespective o f the legal position, and held moreover that the whole liability rested in any case with His Majesty T s Government, since Indian liability for all war obligations had been liquidated oy the contribution which had been made by the Government of India towards the expenses of the war. The Treasury did not accept the view that this liability was covered by the 'War settlement '• 16. Mr. Rendel suggested that if there was no legal liability, and if the proposed payment was intended solely to preserve British prestige in the Gulf, then the payment could not be regarded as a war liability, but must be treated as arising out of present policy. 17. Mr. Walton suggested that the question whether the istihlak tax was covered by the 1914 pledges should oe referred to the Law Officers. The Treasury view was that as a corollary to such reference 'the India Office aiiould undertake to share any consequent financial payment. Mr. Walton suggested that in view of its importance, the question of legal liability should m any case be cleared up. The answer to it would affect the question of the amount of a reasomble composition, and (as Sir F. Humphreys pointed out) the method of approach to the Sheikh. A negative answer might facili 4 4te the Government of India's agreement to a cheaper settlement with the Sheikh. Any question of allocation of the expenditure could be settled afterwards. 18. Mr. Rendel pointed out that if the Law -fficers 1 opinion was that a legal liability did not exist, the case for an Indian contribution would be strengthened, as it would be possible to represent to the Government of India that any payment which it might eventually be decided to make-7 M could be held to place His majesty's Government under a legal obligation to indemnify the Sheikhs against any istihlak tax which might be levied on the sale or export of the produce of their gardens. 21- It was agreed that no decision should betaken regarding a reference to the Law Officers until after the conversations with Sir M. Gwyer. Method of approaching the Sheikha. 22. It would ultimately be necessary to approach the Sheikhs, and it was agreed that the best method of doing this would be to inform the Sheikhs categorically (provided that this point was confirmed by further legal opinion) that the levy of istihlak tax on the produce of the date gardens was not at variance with the 1914 under takings, but to add that, in view of the moral obligation created by those undertakings and in final liquidation of them, and in view also of the fact that His Majesty's Government were now relinquishing all responsibility for Iraq so that they could no longer influence the Iraqi Government in the matter of future taxation, they had decided to offer the Sheikhs such and such a sum in final liquidation of the undertaking and that this was their last word. The Sheikh of Mohammerah. 25. Mr. Rendel said that the Foreign Office were chiefly concerned with this question in so far as it affected the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The foreign Office felt strongly that if any settlement were reached with the Sheikh of Koweit it was essential that the Sheikh of Mohammerah should receive equally favourable treatment. Our obligation to him was in fact just as great as, if no greater than, our obligation to the Sheikh of Koweit. ButBut this aid no^ apply so much in the case of his heirs, who appeared to deserve less consideration, and the Foreign Office would 'be satisfied if adequate arrangements could be made to offer the Sheikh of Moharamerah satisfactory compensation during his own lifetime, 24, The difficulty of making payment to the Sheikh of Mohammerah in present circumstances was discussed. It was agreed that some means woula have to be found of making payment through the Legation in Tehran, to prevent its being embezded by the Sheikh 1 s notoriously dishonest agent in Basrah or seized by the Persian Government, Dispute concerning Sheikh of Koweit T s ownership. 25. At the end of the meeting a brief discussion took place on the question of the ownership of the gardens of the Sheikh of Koweit. The Sheikh of Koweit T s claim to ownership of certain of these gardens has recently been challenged on the ground of a flaw in his original title. Sir Francis explained that there had been a test case in respect of a portion of one very smallgarden; this case the Sheikh had lost. Another case was pendin t in respect of a larger property. At present a deadlock had been produced, because the Sheikh haa withdrawn his power of attorney from his Agent in Basrah, which prevented the Courts from taking action, since the Political Hesident would not serve the writs on the Sheikh of ICoweit, 26, Mr, Beckett thou ht that the 1914 undertaking had been meant to safeguard the Sheikh from precisely the kind of legal action which was now bein : taken against him. It had been suggested that the Sheikh was not amenable to the Iraqi courts by reason of his sovereign status, but Mr, Beckett explained that in the first place it seemed too late to base any case on such a claim at this stage, since the Sheikh had already appeared as a party to legal proceedingsproceedings and had thereby waived any immunity which he might have had. Moreover authorities on international law were sharply divided as to the decree of immunity from the local courts conferred 'by sovereign status as regards questions relating to the ownership of land. 27, It was generally agreed tnat if the Sheikh were dispossessed of any of his gardens he would, have a claim for compensation against His Majesty^ Government. Mr, Tricliett said however he could not at present subscribe to that view. The Treasury were not satisfied that the undertakings could fairly be interpreted as a guarantee to retain the Sheikhs in unlawful possession of the gardens. He suggested that this question might conveniently be included in the reference to Sir Maurice Gwyer on the tax question. 28, Sir Francis undertook to ask the Iraqi Government to pass legislation to safeguard the Sheikh against future claims, but expressed the view that this would be difficult. Postponement of istiklak collection. 89. With regard to the Acting High Commissioner's '^telegram No, 295, it was agreed that the Colonial Office ^should send a rejl^r approving the action proposed, i.e. that he should inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty's Government cannot accept liability for financial loss incurred by the Iraqi Government in postponing the collection of istihlak tax on the Sheiii^ estates, but that he should continue to press for this postponement evea though the conditions suggested by the Iraqi Government could not be accepted.* Confident D • 0 • o • held at th&lt; under Indie following o 2. &gt;1v law does no obligations letter Ho«3i the Istihlali something wi will go into therefore a Record of th&lt; meeting agaii a different ] estimated th£ 25 lakhs by t Francis 1 argv 25 lakhs by t Shaikh includ to the Shaikh certainly lest and I cannot I quotes the ott Government H.A.i.Metcalfe^lfisq.,C«I.E.,M.V.

Under the Istihlak law the Shaikh will have to pay something, this something will be on the produce of his garden8 9 what he pays will go into the revenues of the Iraq Government, and is therefore a tax on his gardens. In paragraph 3 of the Record of the Conference, Sir Francis Humphrys ^ warned the meeting against supposing that the Istihlak tax was merely a different machinery for taking the same amount. It was estiioated that the Iraqi Government would in fact lose some 25 lakhs by the change. 11 I do not quite follow Sir francis* arguments. If the Iraqi Government lose some 25 lakhs by the change, that means that the taxpayers, the Shaikh included, pay so much less. The compensation due to the Shaikh by His SHaJesty's Government is therefore certainly less than it would have been under the old law, and I cannot see that no compensation is due. Sir Francis quotes the other 'Jagir' holders in Iraq, but His Majesty's Government ^ave no promise to other 'jagir* holders, while H«A« F.Metcalfe, Esq. ,C. I.E. ,M.V ,0., they ... Officiating Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi.they did give a promise to the Shaikh* However &gt; as the question of legal liability is being put up to the Law Officers of the Crown (paragraph 20 of the Record) I do not suppose my comments on the point of legal liability are of much use. % 3* I was glad to see that following cn Walton's arguments (paragraph 7 of the Record) 'it was generally agreed that some steps ougjkit to be taken to secure the pay ment to the Shaikhs of some kind of financial compensation in liquidation of the obligations arising out of the 1914 undertakings ,(paragraph 8) # I note, however, in the same paragraph that Mr. Trickett was of opinion that the Treasury would crUy agree to this If the Government of India were prepared to participate.

I have the honour to forward for your information, translation of the following communication which I have received from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. Letter No.2/745.R. dated the 4rth Sha t ban 1S51 (2nd December 1932) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait. 2. The letter speaks for itself and requires little comment. 3# This demand by the Iraq Customs Department far an Export Tax on that portion of the produce of the Shaikh's gardens destined for his own household use in Kuwait, carries out to its end, the declared policy of the Iraq Government, to tax the Shaikh of Kuwait's four date gardens on the Shatt al Arab, for which, he (the Shaikh) possesses a document dated 1914 from His Majesty's Government to the effect that they shall be exempted from any taxation for all time. 4. If I may make the suggestion I think the time has come for the strongest representations to be made to-2- to His Majesty's Grovenuneiit, for an early decision as to the manner in which it is proposed to compensate the Shaikh of Kuwai t o g o The long drawn out delay in settling this question has had a deplorable effect in Kuwait, and will with out doubt find an echo down the Persian Gulf and in Nejd. It is unfortunate, but as you know true, that we have been accused of breach of faith, where the Shaikh of Mohammerah was concerned, and I think our good name and prestige should not be asked to stand another such n Shock n . where Kuwait is concern ed* 6 # The Shaikh's cousin Abdullah as-Salim yesterday made the rather unpleasant but somewhat apt remark to me apropos of the recent annulment by the Persian G-overn- ment of the D , Aroy Concession# w If you do not play square with your friends, you must not expect sympathy if your enemies break agreements^. This I mention in passing as an example of what people are thinking of here. 7, It is of interest to note that the Iraq Grovemnent has proceeded quite methodically in the matter of the taxation of the Shaikh's gardens, (a^Ashur* tax was taken on the ''Shitwi' (or winter crop)of the gardens in the Spring of 1932» (b)'Ashur'Hax was taken on the 'Saifi' (or summer crop) in the summer of 1932. (c) They have now (Autumn 1932) demanded customs export tax on garden produce (fruit, wood, lucern- grass, dates, palm fronds, etc.,) destined for the Shaikh's own household in Kuwait, such produce being exempt from taxation by law, to property UC owners residing in Iraq. In connection with 7 (c) above I woulc draw your attention to my confidential D.O.letter No. 194 dated the 28th October 1932 to H .A .Cooper, Esquire, the Director of Customs and Excise, Basrah, copy of which was sent to you, in/t + s-^ in particular to telegram marked 4, which was sent as an Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col«| Political Agent, Kuwait.— ■ HI f- - m I 1 \ t I#:-- 1 W t m # ;|Kil : J R ' ■I' fep- \ Translation of a l etter^ From - His Excellency Shaikh Sir ^hmad al-Jablt as-Subah, K.C .I .E., C.S .I. , Ruler of Kuwait. # To - The Political Agent, Kuwait.

I find that the 1 Iraqi Govern ment iiave ordered that export duty shall be taken on all taxable exports from * Iraq by the Shaikh of Koweit, Immunity from these dues has been conceded in the past to garden produce exported from 'Iraq for the personal use of the Shaikh, but, as it is not covered by any law or agreement, it is not possible, now that the istihlak tax is being enforced throughout the country, for the Government to continue to allow exemption for these exports. This produce is # therefore, brought into the same category as that of the remainder of the produce exported from the Shaikh^ gardens in 'Iraq, 2, In view of the fact that the 'Iraqi Government have given no official reply to a request made by the High Commission, and subaequenlly by His Majesty's Legation, that the produce of the gardens of the Shaikh should be exempted from the istihlak tax until the whole question had been settled, I do not anticipate that any good result would be achieved by an official protest on this smaller matter, certainly not until some progress has been made towards reaching a settlement of the problem, 3. I take this opportunity to forward a copy of my despatch No, 29 of January 12th 1933, to the Foreign Office, in The Honourable the Political Reeadent in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E,in which I put forward suggeations as to the lines on which an attempt should 'be made to estimate the amount which the Shaikh is out of pocket as the result of the imposition of the iatihlak tax, as a basis for the assess ment of compensation should it be decided that His Majesty's Government will pay compensation.

Sir, ^ V» r ith reference to correspondence ending with your telegram No.T.5. dated the 13th January 1923 to His Majesty*s Ambassador, Baghdad, copy of which you sent to the Grovernment of India and to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. I have the honour to report thfct His Excellency the Shaikh called on me yesterday (E3rd January 1933) and informed me that his Fao Agent had arrived in Kuwait with the news that his boat-load of dates lying in the Shatt al Arab off the Fao Customs House was in eminent danger of being com pletely ruined as a result of the recent widespread rains, and that it was imperative that the Customs Sxport Tax be paid immediately and the boat released. That he, the Shaikh, had accordingly ordered the Customs Export Duty to be paid under protest, purely in order to save the dates, and because he had received no further instructions as a result of your represent ations to His Majesty's Ambassador, and none seemed likely to7/ to be forthcoming in the imnediate future. 2® His Excellency further made the following rather serious allegation against the Kudir of Customs at Fao, but whether this was due to a deliberate desire on the part of the latter to make himself unpleasant, or because of orders he had received, ho, the Shaikh, was not prepared to say« ^he allegation took the following form, and was based on the report of his, the Shaikh's Agent• The dates in question, which as already reported were destined for the Shaikh* s own household use, consisted of approximately 150 baskets (gosaras) each of 1% ^wt. These at the end of December had been loaded on a small dhow ready for shipment to Kuwait, The dhow had been ordered to anchor opposite the Fao Customs House and remain there, until the Customs Export Tax was paido •Vhen the heavy rain which fell on 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th of January^irst started, the Shaikh's Agent requested the lludir of Customs, to allow him to unload the dates and place them under shelter on shore, or failing this, either to permit tarpaulins to be placed over the cargo,or at least allow the boat to be run up a neighbouring creek and placed in a position of shelter close to a house belonging to the Shaikh which lies inside the said creek. According to the Agent's stalJrnent; all three requests were categorically refused, with the result that the boat became waterlogged with resulting heavy damage to the cargo. His ]$xcellency pointed out that he had no reason to doubt the statement of his agent who had hitherto proved himself a reliable man, and opimed that nowhere in the world would a reasonable request of this nature, have been refused. The fact that it was so refused, forced him to the belief, much against his will, that there was behind the lludir's action, the intention to put him the Shaikh to financial loss and shame# His Excellency significantly added that of course the ultimate responsibility and fault lay with His-3- -W V' His Majesty*s GovGrnment which had so far failed to implement the promise made by Sir Percy Cox in his telegram IIo. 4051 dated tl^e 30th September 1917, copy of which had at the time been given to his predecessor Shaikh Salim by the lolitical Agen^♦ This was tc the effect that dates, etco, destined for the Shaikh of Kuwait's household use should be exempt from Iraq Sxport Duty# V/hile I am not prepared entirely to vouch for the statements of the Shaikh's Agent regarding the refusal of the Mudir at Fao to allow reasonable measures to be taken for the protection of the cargo of dates, during the undoubtedly heavy rains which fell on the 12th January and onwards, the latter prima facie would appear to have displayed some lack of tact and courtesy, more especially as he must have known that he was dealing with dates belonging to the Ruler of a neighbouring and friendly State. There is little doubt I think that the dates did also suffer damage, otherwise His Excellency who for a close on a month has steadfastly refused to pay the Export Duty in the hopes that some thing would be arranged by His Majesty's Government, would scarely A have decided suddenly to pay the tax# *7. It is very regrettable that the above incident should have come on the top of the long drawn out delay in settl ing the Date Gardens and Blockade questions, and at the very moment when the Anglo-Persisn Oil Company and Eastern General Syndicate having received His Majesty's Government's permission to open direct negotiations with the Shaikh, are engaged in trying to get an oil concession out of him# For it is obviously desirable that the Shaikh at this time more than any other should not have his faith and trust in His Majesty's Government's power to extri cate him from his difficulties, further shaken# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ' • * Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait#m 11 / 1^ Gonfld0ntial &gt; HOol5. 1 )C -m' ;Hj5HlRF RESiQJiNCY. v Political Agency, Kuwait.

On 3pd Novenber 1S14 His Uajesty'e Ooremmaot addressed a eommunieatlon to Shaikh Mubarak and after thanking him for ills loyalty anti oITer f ordered hla to attack the Turkish posts of Um Qfrsr, oafwan, and Bublyan and oooupy them# He was further told to follow this up by an attack on the Basrah and liberate it irom the Turks# If this should prore an impossible tesk f he was to arrange to preyent Turkish relnforonaents frota reaching Jasrah or even wurnah t until such time as the British Expeditionary ^orce which was being despatched from India r ived. Other detailed orders, such as the using of his inriuence and strength to prevent the Turks harming Britidh Sjiojects and their property in Basrah, as well as the guarding of other European subjects there etc* etc., were included in this official letter. As a reward for his labours and in ths event of ths allies winning ths war. His Majesty's Oovemment made the following premises to the ahaikh. (a / • The t your gardens which are now in your possession, viz, the date gardens situate between Fao and 4umah, shall remain in your possession, and in the possession of your decendents, without being subject to ths payment of revenue or taxes* (b} # That if you attack iiafwan, Ua jasr and Bubiyan and occupy them, tl» British Oovernmen will protect you from any eonseQuences arising from that action* (o) That the BrltlA Government does recognize ana adnlt that 'ttie Shaikhdom of Kuwait is an Independent Oovemmaat under British Protection'*The war orer, His Majesty's Oovemiasnt laplomented all her promises» up-to ths time of signing of t T ip treaty between Great Britain and Iraq, which was to admit the latter to the League of Nations as an Independent c?tate» Q Unfortunately nothing was said in the traty about His Majesty's Government's promises to the Huler of Kuweit in respect of the four exempted date gardens. Today the attitude of the Iraq Govemiaent is that the promises made by His Uajesty^ Oorerument are not her oonoern, and that she considers herself entitled to take full rerenue and taxes from the four gardens owned by the ahaiklu Up to the middle of 1931, His Majesty 1 s Ooremment managed to persuade Iraq to hold her hand pending dlsous p ions on the matter, but wiVi tl» introduction and enforcement of 'Istahlak' Law by the Iraq Crorernment in 1931 1 which Law provided that the purohaaer plCexporter of garden produce (dates, etc.) should pay the M Asbur M (10^) tax, the shaikh at Kuwait has in effect had to pay full taxation on his gardens, for naturally the Indlrldual, merchant or company buying a garden owner's ) ' produce, deducts from the fixed purchase price, the exact amount he the exporter is required by Law to pay over to Government taxation. This indirect, but nevertheless real, method of paying revenue, has been enforced since the Autumn of 1931, xx and as far as the Shaikh's 4 gardens are concerned, taxation has been indirectly paid on his winter crop *3hitwi* of 1931-32 (fruit, wheat, barley, etc.), and again on his summer crop 'saifi' of 1952 (dates). The Shaikh made many vigorous appeals to His Majesty's Governnmnt in the matter, but so far without result. It seems clear that since His Majesty 9 s Government failed to insist on a clause being inserted in the Treaty with Iraq, under which the latter should have been required tig 1° honour His Majesty's Government's obligations to the Shaikh,&amp;baikh, His Majesty's OoT«rnm«at muat now ••pay the piper' and oaapenaate the Shaikh for present and future loasea due to the payaeat of the Ashur Tax. As regards (b), In August 1930 a clever campaign was started In the Basrah Law Courts with the object of dis possessing the Shaikh of his Bashlyeh garden (part of the large ^aadagfclyofe Instate)* Proceedings lingered on till 80th December 1951 f whon tie appelate court In Baghdad gare a decision against the Shaikh, The plaintiff In the case case wes a certain lady naned Baflyah daughter of one 3haflqah f who sold the property to Shaikh Mubarak In 1908 for £.T # 4409 # The case was apparently a ,, test w one and according to the Shaikh 9 was not so much due to lady Raflyah's own activities, as to Inspiration from Baghdad. In the spring of 1932 a similar attack was raade in respect of the shaikh's large 'Faddaghlyeh' estate, and In the sumoer of the same year, a suit was filed In the Basrah Courts against the Shaikh by one Abdullah Beg as-Zuhalr. The Fad aghlyoh property. Is situate opposite Abadafe/and was purchased In 1908 for £60000 also by Shaikh Mubarak, froa a lady called Alsha (Awasha) i wife of Ahmad Pasha as-^uhalr, and erery person of note In Basrah witnessed the sale deeds Including such proalnent men as the Shaikh of Uohammsrah, the Kaqlb, aeyed Tallb Pasha, Isa Pasha al Zuhalr {father of the present plaintiff In the case) etc. A regular ^Cause celebre' resulted, for the Turks refused to allow Shaikh ubarak to take out ^apu ^eeds, unless he registered himself as a Turkish subject. This under Instructions fron His Majesty's Government he refused to do. Behind the Turks policy waswas tha Idaa that toy axaBtlng pressura on iihaDdi uberuk, t.iey mi^it gat him to hraafc with the Brit 1 ah ^ovaramefit, wltfa whan ha had raoantly alllad hlmaalf by treaty. Intrigue and oountar Intrigue continued between the Turks and ChaUch Mubarak till 1914, without the latter budging fraa his standpoint, or registering as Turk, ©urine this period his garden was looked after by one Hamad al Khalid an Important Kuwaiti land owner of Basrah. On the outbreak of the ^reat 'BT in 1914 and after the occupation of Basrah f propsr 'iapu papeaiv.era finaLiy is ued to Shaikh Mubarak by Ur.Dobbs, later air ^enry Bobb8 t who was the Reranue Cocaaissioner Basrah, after full enquiry Into the whole history of the case had been made, and the shaikhs title proved. Much oorrespondenoa passed between the shaikh and His Majesty's OoTermnant regarding the Bashiyah and ^ad aghiyah Law suits, and ended in the Jhaikh appealing In 19S2 to the British Ooremmant to protect his interests, under t he -irt clause of His Majesty's Gkrrernmsnt 1 s promise, made in their lette of 3rd November 1914 to Shaikh Mubarak (see above), and on the grounds, that he, the shaikh posses:: cd proper ^ - tie d«3»eds i .• -.wd by His Majesty's Revenue^ Conmissioner during the British occupation, and lastly because proceedings were •'time barred' 1 . The Faddaghiyeh case at the time of writing this note, reiaains undecided apparently as a result of His Majesty 1 s Government interesting themselves in the matter. The iihalkh however continues to be consumed with goxlety Q.5 the eventutal outocBie or suit, ss ; vast pro ^ert.y Is involved, and he feels uncertain of His Majesty 's Government's eventual reactions. As in the Bashlyeh ease the Shaikh Is eonvlnced that much of the trouble hSf^e been inspired from Baghdad. As regards (0). During the Turkish regime, all dates etc. exported from Iraq paid an export tax to the btate, which in the caae of laden dhows was collscted at Fao. After-e- jS After the oooupatlon of Iraq by the Brltl rfi Forces, this tax oont tnued to be taken, except on dates exported by the bhalkh of Kuwait from his own properties, and for his own household use# This exemption was allowed In accordance with the first clauae of ills majesty's C&gt;ovemzaetit's premise made to Shaikh Mubarak In their letter of 3rd November 19X4. In 1917 the question arose as to whether this was a fair exemption In the Interests of the Civil Admlnlstratloi of Iraq, but on the matter being referred to the Olrll Commlssl- oner, ercy 0ox f the latter decided that Ihe exemption fell within i-ls majesty's Gove mm ea t f s promise, and ordered the director of Customs Basrah to continue sudh exemption, see Sir Percy Cox f s telegram No.4051 of 30th September 1917 to the Political Agent, Kuwait, the eontents of which were oommmloated to the Shaikh. In December 1932 the Iraq Owe ram en t following out their declared policy of allowing ttie ahalkh of Kuwait no exemption frcm revenue or taxation, Informed the letter's agent at i?ao that all produce exported from the hitherto exempt gardens must pay export tax, as others were doing under the plea that It was the Law of the land. Protests and necesBary representations were Imnwdlately made by the Shaikh to HI a Uaje«ty&lt;8 Oorenmant as bafore, but at the time of writing nothing has been done. At the end of Ceoember 1933, the first oargo of dates from the ahalkh's garden at ?ao, destined for his own household, was seized at Fao by the Iraq Customs authorities and export tax demanded. After nearly a month's deley the Shaikh wee forced to pay the tax In self-defence and to enable the dates and other produce to reach his household. ■fhe circumstances of the seizure of this oargo, wpp apparently attended by much unnecessary rudeness and lack of tact on the part of the Customs authorities, who are said to hare refused to allow any steps to be taken by the ahalkh 's agent to protect the dates from ttis heavy rains of early January,-7- 3* The abore points have been summarized In this ^eaoy f s confidential letter Ko.210 dated the 8th December 1932 to the Hobble the Political Besldent in the Persian Gulf &gt; a copy of which Is at ached to this note with the request tfoat It b« kept etrlotly oonfldentlal. 4* There have been other Instances also notably that connected with the compelling of Kuwait water boats to C proceed to Fao 9 and register themselves there every tiMrth^r go to fetch water f with payment of certain feos 9 which all aocordlng to the Shaikh tend to show that the Iraq authorities are pursuing a well defined policy towards himself and the people of Kuwait* 5. This policy the Shaikh belleres to be the sane as that followed by Bin Saud 9 althougi different methods are employed. Both Bin Saud ancl Iraq clearly covet Kuwait 9 for the reason that Its port Is the best In the Persian Oulf* The former chooses to use the 'Blockade^ and 'Starving methods* t hoping eventually to force the Shaikh to acknowledge his suzerainty 9 while the latter prefer to adopt the more subtle mesne of attacking his private person! In the form of pressure on his estates. Both Kingdoms do not as yet appear to have realized that His Majesty 9 s Government Is bound by treaty to protect the Independence of Kwralt.

Your covering despatch asked that the allegations should 'be 'brought to the notice of the 'Iraqi Government, I considered it preferable, before taking this action, to refer the matter privately to the British Adviser to the Ministry of Finance, with the request that he would make enquiries from the Customs Department, which is still under the direction of British officers, and let me know if the allegations made by the Shaikh's agent could be substantiated. I cannot do better than send you a copy of the letter which has been received in reply, from which I think you will deduce, as I have done, that a formal representation to the 'Iraqi Government THE HON'BL3 LIEUTENANT-COLONEL T.G.W.

The officer in question reports that he permitted a 'boom to be loaded with 50 maunds of dates only and that he * was then requested by the Agent to permit the unloading of these dates at one of the Shaikh's houses in Pao* He refused this.

Otherwise might not a fornel protest on the lines proposed in your telegram be tantamount to an admission by His Majesty^ Government that there is a legal breach of the undertaking, which would subsequently be embarrassing, particularly if law officers advise in a contrary sense. As regards placing tax collections on deposit Iraq Government are clearly most reluctant to grant any concession to Sheikh where Istihlak tax is concerned. I should prefer not to address protest officially on this minor point as there is nothing much to be gained from having the amount of tax collected placed in a deposit account. The same effect can be achieved by Sheikh keeping a complete record of amounts paid. If in subsequent negotiations Iraq Government agree to refund such collections it will make no difference v«hether the money is nominally on deposit or not. jV'* Copy sert \A, , Kuwait, UTider o.l.

As you will see they are both in entire agreement with that proposal, which has also the support of Sir Samuel Hoare. I understand that the Treasury have however felt some little doubt as to the entire soundness of action on the lines suggested. We agree with what I understand to be their view, that it is undesirable to do anything which might arouse unjustified or exaggerated expectations in the mind of the Sheikh or migfrt compromise our position, and these considerations had been fully present to us when we made the proposal in question. But we do not feel complete confidence that the Sheikh (who does not appear to be a particularly businesslike person and who has clearly not been toe well served by his agents and bailiffs in the past) can be relied on to take the obvious course of keeping a record of payments made and we still do not think tuat any harm woula be done by a discreet and quite informal hint (we would not go beyond this) as to the advisability keeping some record, to be given by Dickson, who, as you know, is in close daily contact with the Sheikh and from whose despatches the question of the date gardens appears to be a frequent topic of conversation.

J We enclose for your information a copy of the minutes of a conference on the Shaildi of Kuwait's date gardens which the Political Resident attended when he was in Bagdad last week. Yours ever CEANCERY The Residency BUSHIREA conference was held in the Anbasoador's room this morning. There were present besides the Ambassador: Lieut»-Colonel T. C. Powle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. Stafford, Financial Secretary. Mr. Nihill, Legal Secretary. The Ambassador said that he would like to consider first the actual present legal situation with regard to the two suits, Bashiyah and Faddaghiyah. Li eut*-Colonel Powl e pointed out that, although the Shaikh had lost the Bashiyah suit in the Appeal Court, it still apparently remained open to him to apply for revision. If he did so, he would have to again accept the jurisdiction which might prejudice him in the matter of the Faddaghiyah suit; on the other hand, His Majesty^ Government might take the 'view that he should exhaust all legal remedies open to hiix; before coming to them for compensation. The Shaikh had two grounds on which he might base his claim for revision (a) that the Court had improperly refused to admit evidence that he was in possession prior to sale, and (b) that the r Traq. Land Act should override the provisions of the Hejelle. If he was right on either of these two points the suit was statute barred. Mr, iTihill said that he thought it unlikely that a claim by the Shaikh for revision would be accepted by the Court, The Article in the Civil Procedure Code which dealt with revision of Appellate judgments made it clear that the only permissible grounds for revision were when an aggrieved party could show a prima facie case that the winning suitor had obtained his judgment by fraud or by the suppression of some material document. Both the points raised by the Political Resident were points of law which had already been before the Appeal Court. Stafford- 2 - Kp » ••Stafford pointed out that the sueceyeful applicant would not be able to oust the Shaikh from possession until similar judgments had 'been obtained in favour of his co-heirs. Sununonses iiad been issued hy these co-heirs but the Shai&amp;h had refused to accept tlieia. If ul tiuiately the Shailch accepted jurisdiction, presi/mably the points raised by Colonel Fcwle could be urged again on behalf of the Shail^h-- The ^jribassa dor asked Colonel ..; 1 orle how far he thought the Shaikh had been prejudiced by the advice given to hin before the war by His Majesty's Gcvemiaent on the ^stion of his acceptance of Turkish nationality. Colonel Fowle replied that it looked as if the Shaikh could have acquired a Tapu title quite easily h^d he beer, willing to accept Turkish nationality. The Resident in the Gulf at that time certainly advised him not to do so, as it was His Majesty 1 s Government's policy to keep the Shaikh under tiieir influence. Lieut. -Colonel Fowl e said that, as regards the Paddaghiyah suit, the Shaikh was going to rive as his reasons for refusal to accept service cf the summorui, that, as an independent ruler, he was not gjuena'blo to the jurisdiction Oj . the 'Iraqi courts. Mr. Hihill said that this would be a valuable delaying move. Ke did not, however, think that the point was good in International ; -aw as tne sui o concerned immovable property situated within the jurisdiction. The Ambassador stated that in his view little further could be done until the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on the general question of the guarantee was received. But it would be necessary to bear in mmd tnat, oesides compensation for loss of revenue exemption, it looiced as i-i- the Shaikh might ultimately appeal to His Majesty's Government for compensation for loss of possession as well. /TheThe question of the revenue exemption was briefly diacuasod but it was agreed that no further useful action conoid bo taken locally until the Lav Officeifc had advised (a) us to whether there was tuiy legal obli^a^ion on His Majesty^ Government, and (b) if so, whether the istinlok tax is an infringement of the revenue exemption goarantae# 11th April, 193 5*1 11 J.

I have also considered the question put forward in paragraph 3 your telegram upon which you asked for ray views as to whether the Shaikh should safeguard his rights by paying the amounts demanded from him by the 'Iraqi vijvernment under protest. As the agents of t he Shaikh have already protested vigorously to the 'Iraqi Government as represented by the Collector of Customs and Excise at Basrah, when paying the export duty demanded, I am inclined to think that no useful purpose would be served at this stage by the presentation of a formal protest by the Shaikh through me to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Indeed, in view 0! the fact that ilis .aje8ty T 8 Government have not yet agreed that the operation of the istihlak tax does violate the I9I4 undertaking, and this question is now under the consideration 02 the Law Officers of the Crown. I am advised that such action might present possible dangers. sl pen , ho ever, that on each occasion when the tax is paid, his agent should continue to protest in writing and to keep copies of such protests.

Attitude of Iraqi G-overnment, which has been consistent ly adopted in principle since time when Sir Heskell Sassoon was first Minister of Finance, is as follows:- Promises made to Sheikhs are in fact attributed to and were made under stress of war conditions at a time when pro tection of India and Anglo-Persian oilfields, not independence of Iraq, was in question. Cost of these promises has unjustly fallen on Iraq to extent of about 80 ,000 pounds and Ministry of Finance has protested each year that exemptions are illegal. Iraqi Govern- ment refuse to accept devolution of obligation which was not included in the list presented in 1924 and even contest lia~ ability to legalise exemptions already granted 0 Nuri Pasha hinted that if His Majesty's ' ' ' ' * Vnst vo -ded terms of reference were agreed on by both parties* Such terms should he said include question of liability for exemp tions enjoyed since April 1921, In view of above I consider that there is nu chance Iraqi Government this might whateverv.tiatever of Iraqi Government giving way on this que^ion whether faced with alternative of arbitration or noo. It is m considered opinion that His Majesty's Governnsnt stand to lose more ty taking Iraqi Government to aroi-ra- tion thaa by direct talk with SieiKhs since m la^uer event there is a good chance that Iraqi Government might be persuaded to make no claim on account of past exemptions. On general grounds also I strongly deprecate recourse to arbitration on so weak a case. Although no accurate figures will be forthcoming till next October instalme^u, in effect Sheikhs are not losing more than £5,000 per annum at present through operation of Ishtilak tax, possioly considerably lesSe I suggest simplest method of meeting our liabilities is to'pay Sheikhs annual sum to be agreed on to cover annual loss on exemptions, subject to review on death of present Sheikhs and to treat question of possession of gardens on its meri'cs.^3 oCo-- \ \y I' ^EDIAT E Your tele^ryjn ro 6 69 (date gardens in Iraq of the Sheilcha of Mohammerah and Koweit). I should he glad of further explanation on following pointB, as to which I am -ot clear, '1) Am I to assume that you now consider that T - T is Majesty's Government should themselves accept whole lia bility for compensating Sheikhs for loss of taj exemption, and that you no longer regard as practicable suggestion that Iraqi Government should contribute indirectly by grant of anti-smuggling subsidy to Sheikh of Koweit? (2) In describing case for arbitration as weal:, did you overlook fact that Law Officers advised, in June 1930, that His Majesty's Government would have a reasonable prospect of success? Law Officers would, moreover, probably be consulted again on case as it exists today before decision to arbitrate were taken, (5) What is the precise meaning of your suggestion that question of possession (which may well prove crux of the whole matter) should be treated on its merits? Tjc you intend that His Majesty's Government should let matteis take their course and should compensate Sheikh as and when dispossessed of portions of his property; or do vou contern- plaxe soma arrangement whereby in return for acceptance b^ His Majesty's Government of full or partial liability in respect of tax exemption,Iraqi Government would undertake to vaiidate_Sheikh's title,at all events in case of Fadaghivda estate? If the former,sole advantage to be gained by His Majesty's Govemrent from abstaining from arbitration would be possible abandonment by Iraqi Government of claim in respect of past tax exemptions.tyio treaty or 1922 liad b^en by the treaty of 1930. The reference to arbitration «ould now be governed by article 10 of the treety of 1930, and the &lt;3ss« of His Mejesty's Govarnraent would have to be baeed upon the eecond part of ©rtlcle 8 of that treaty. i'l 1 .l-'..J^ ^ckett satd the?., though His Majesty^s Gov6rnnent A*ouiG( have to base their cace prlBtarily on z he treaty oi' 1930, they could, he thought» otill sujvport indirectly by arguing that the Iraqi Govern- neut hed 9 during the currency of the 1922 treaty, been und«r en obligation t.o accept the advice of His Majesty e Government under aj^ticlo 4 'on all i.espoj' \e.x\\. matter a affecting the international and rinancial obligations and interests of Hie Britannic y * I- snci iri this matter of the date gardans they had raxled to do eo.

In paragraph 2 of his despatch of 16th March,No .165, to the Foreign Office, of which a copy was sent to you direct, His Majesty f s Ambassador in Baghdad expressed the opinion that no useful purpose would be served at that stage by the presentation of a formal protest by the Sheikh of Koweit, through the Embassy at Baghdad, to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs against the taxation by the Iraq Government of those of his Date Gardens in Iraq which were covered by the guarantee given him by His Majesty's Government in 1914. As will be seen from the enclosed copy of a letter from the Foreign Office, the 19th Aprils Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in view of the fact that the Law Officers of the Crown have now expressed the opinion that the imposition of the Istihlak tax on the gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mo hammer ah is not consistent with the pledges given to those Sheikhs on behalf of His Majesty's Government in November 1914, now agrees that there might be advantage in a formal protest and I am to request that you will advise the Sheikh of Koweit accordingly and transmit the Sheikh's protest, when received, to His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad for communication to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Secretary of State, after consultation with you, would suggest that the Sheikh's protest might take the form of a letter addressed to the Political Agent, intimating that. The Hon'ble Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bu shire. asit as Colonel Dickson is aware, the Iraq G-overnment were collecting Istihlak tax from his Date Gardens in Iraq which, under the guarantee given to his predecessor by His Majesty's Government in 1914, were exempt from taxation; that his \ agents had on various occasions represented this fact to the tax collectors of the Iraq Government but without effect; that in allowing any payment to be made he did so under protest, reserving all his rights in the matter; and that he desired now that the matter should formally be brought to the notice of the Iraq Government with a view to steps being taken by them for the issue of instructions that the collection of tax should cease, 3.

First essential is to protect Sheikh of Koweit from dispossessiono This has now 'become paramount consideration. Apart from serious damage to British prestige, dispossession might involve payment by His Majesty's Government of a ver^ substantial sum in compensation, and Iraqi claimants might not rest content with ejecting Sheikh but might put forward claim (even if this should not prove enforceable) to an ac count of all profits made by Sheikh from estate during period of wrongful occupation, 2 C If Sheikh's title could be made secure, it is probable that His Majesty's Government would agree to waive claim to tax exemption, and would arrange themselves to com pensate both Sheikhs in respect of future taxation,provided that Iraqi Government for their part abandoned claim to arrears of tax and undertook to impose no discriminatory taxation on Sheikhs in future. 3 0 '^very possible effort should therefore be made to induce Iraqi Government to validate Sheikh's title by legis lative or administrative aet. Intervention by Iraqi Govern' ment is fully justified on grounds of equity, since, owing to a purely technical flaw in Sheikh's title, normal pro cess of law would lead to grave injustice. Legislation/3. Legislation 'to remedy position need not refer expressly to Sheikh of Koweit but might take the form of general measure of validation similar to post-war United Kingdom legislation, (e.g. Indemnity Act and War Charges Validity Act). Such an act would he in accordance with normal practice of nations and would be entirely consistent with principles underlying Part 8 of Iraqi Constitution. 4. i appreciate that Iraqi Government might find it more difficult to intervene in case of Bashiyah estate than in that of Paddaghiyah estate (which was registered by responsiole official acting in the due discharge of authority regularly conferred upon him during military occupation - see note to Article 114 in Hooper's edition of Iraqi Constitu tion). But if at all possible Iraqi Government should be persuaded to redress miscarriage of Justice in Bashiyah case also. 5. unless you see overwhelming objection, please ex- ploie the possibility of an amicable settlement on the fore going lines, making it clear in your discussions with the Iraqi Government that you are acting titre personnfii and 'without prejudice'. While you alone can judge what argu ments are most likely to prove effective, I suggest that you emphasize the desirability of disposing of this troublesome question, which may seriously affect the relations between the two Governments, before King Peisal visits this country in June. Also you might state that His Majesty's Government take so serious a view of the question of possession that it is your personal opinion that, failing an amicable settle ment, they may well feel compelled to refer the whole issue including the question of taxation, either to the Council of the League of Nations or to The Hague under Article 10 of the/4 — [(pU 3. the Treaty; and you might point out the unfortunate effect which this would have upon Iraq's international reputation so soon after her admission to the League of Nations. 6. Ihe question of the co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in suppression of smuggling, in return for payment to cover cost of preventive measures, might he discussed at the same time, if you consider it advisable in interests of securing a settlement.

Sir, I have the honour to report a rather interesting development in the matter of the above, disputed property, which I think both you and His Majesty's G-overnment should know about. 2 # As you are aware, of the whole property known as the Faddaghiyeh Estate, the Bashiyeh strip is under enspute . as is also that portion of the Faddaghiyeh, which was bought by Shaikh Mubarak from the Lady rt Awasha n through her husband Ahmad Pasha al -^uhair, for ^i.44,217. 3 # Full details as to the position, history, etc. of the disputed properties were recently sent to hr. Stafford of the British Embassy, Baghdad by me, in this Office Confidential D»0.No.l07, dated the 24th -ay 1933, a copy of which was also sent to you. 4, You have already appreciated no doubt, that there are six young ladies claiming the third and largest poruion of the t, Bashiyeh ,, , one of whom, Rafiyah, has already got a judgement in her favour• 5./- - 2 - ifcl 5o You have also doubtless gathered that the claim^ ants to the disputed 'Faddaghiyeh' Estate consist of 3 persons: (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, nephew of Awasha ; (b) Najeeba ) ) daughters of Awasha ; (c) Aida ) who each claim 1 /3 of the disputed area. 6» Hitherto^ we have heard a lot about the activities of (a) Abdulla al Zuhair, but little mention has been made of the ladies (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida, her sister. 7,(a)Abdulla al Zuhair, who lives in Basrah, so far tias been the only of the three who has filed a suit. His h cousins (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida have been content to re main in Constantinople and watch events, knowing full well that if Abdulla won his case they would easily get judge ments in their favour also, as the claims of each are identi' cal. 8o Recently (b), the Lady Najeeba, arrived in Basrah^ impatient at the slow progress that (a) Abdulla as Zuhair was making in the matter. 9• The lawyer employed by (a) Abdulla al Zuhair is one Mr.Sulaiman al Shawaf, son, I believe, of the President ^ cl, Ax-A, of the Sh^ifeh Court in Baghdad; while K.B.IIirza Mohamed, C.I.3., has been engaged on behalf of (b) Najeeba and (c) Aida. On the other side of the picture, an Armenian 'fVvv. ^ Lawyer, of the firm of Yacub and Arteen, who, with Mirza Mohamed Khan may be considered the two best lawyers that Basra can produce, is watching the case on behalf of His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait. Note. The position of these lawyers and thei» clients they respectively represent, is, I think, important. 10. Last week (28.5.33.) both Mr.Gabriel and Ldrza Mohamed- 3 - n 0 Mirza Mohamed visited Kuwait, and called independently on the Shaikh and myself. 11&lt;, The gist of their separate conversations with me may be summed up as follows:- (a) Mirza Iiohamed . assured me, had only come to collect certain debts, due from Kuwaitis to his client, the late Shaikh of Mohammerah, but gradual -ly getting on.to the Faddaghiyeh land question, he gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh had no chance, whatsoever, of winning, should the case come into Court, as it was bound to do eventually, however much the Shaikh tried to out of it, by refusing to accept sum mons etc. etc. Mirza Mohamed added that quite the best thing he (the Shaikh) could do, in his opinion, was to try and compound the case. He thought he could persuade (b)Najeeba and (c) Aida to accept £S000/- each, although they would certainly ask £5000 and Mr.Gabriel would suggest this sum to the Shaikh. He could not, however, say anything about (a) Abdulla al Zuhair. He mentioned, however, that the youngman owed Najeebt Rs.20,000/-, for which an I.O.U. had passed hands (date expired) and that he (Mirza Mohamed) believed he could bring pressure to bear on him by threatening to put him in Court for failure to pay this debt if he would not r toe the line*. (b) I.Ir.Q-abriel , in his interview, was equally emphatic about the Shaikhs case being a hopeless ly bad one in Law, and that his one and only hope lay in our being able to get from Istamboul, a copy of the original Pcwer of Attorney, granted ' ^washa ' to her husband, authorizing the sale of/i ni Note, - 4 - of her property. (This has already been asked for) Mr.Gabriel then said that the Shaikhk best course, if we failed to get the above document, was to pay £T.5000/- to each of the three parties in the case, and so settle the matter for good and all, otherwise he saw every chance of the Shaikh losing the whole of that portion of the Fadaaghiyeh property which was in dispute and with it the £T.44,217/-, originally given for it. Lastly Mr.Gabriel said that he had hinted this form of settlement to the Shaikh, but the latter had not appeared enthusiastic, and had said something about consulting the Political Agent. Up to the time of writing the Shaikh has not mentioned the matter to the writer. 12. It is interesting to note that Mirza Mohamed and Mr.Gabriel are great personal friends, and on this occasion travelled to and frcm Kuwait in the same car. They also lived together whilst in Kuwait. 15. It is also interesting to recollect that Mr. Gabriel was the lawyer 'working for the other side in the ^Bashiyeh^ case when the Basra Courts gave a decree in favour of Rafiyah, daughter of Shafiqa. On that occasion Mirza Mohamed, who represented Rafiyah and another sister, appointed Mr.Gabriel to take charge of the case as he 9 being a Persian could not take part in the Courts proceedings 44. Incidentally, when discussing with Mr.Gabriel the old Bashiyeh suit, the writer got the interesting ad mission out of him that had the Shaikh been properly de fended, he would never have lost that property; as, if a certain point of Ottoman Land Law had been raised by the defence, the whole prosecutions case would have fallen to- 5 - to the ground. The Shaikhs Agent in Basrah had employed, he said, a 3rd rate man called Mr.Mansur, who, through sheer ignorance of the law, threw the case away. (The above was mentioned in strict confidence, of course). 15. Both Mirza Hohamed and Mr.Gabriel mentioned that Abdulla al Zuhair, had promised his own lawyer, Mr.SulAiman Shawaf £2,500/- if the latter won the Fad- daghiyeh case for him, and nothing if he did not - an illuminating example of the methods of the Basrah Bar. 16. I have thought it my duty to report the above facts in detail, as I do not particularly trust any law yer in Basrah and have more than a suspicion that both the Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh suits, were originally worked up by an interested gang of advocates, who, no doubt, hoped and do still hope to bleed both the Shaikh and their own clients thoroughly, before finishing with them. 17. I am still unable to decide in my own mind why the suggestions that the Shaikh should compomnd the case, has, at this eleventh hour,been brought forward by the Shaikhs lawyer as well as by the lawyer of one of the plaintiffs in the suit. Possibly Mr.Gabriel and Mirza Mohamed, who are a little too intimate, for my liking, have got wind of seme thing from Baghdad, which makes them apprehensive as to the eventual outcome of the case. They certainly know that His Majesty's Government is deeply in terested, and might even send out their own counsel to watch proceedings if the case went to Court. I have the honour to be.

MO SUBJECT ; SJmikJi ol* Kuwait's date gardens. Sir I JiaTe the honour to refer to correspondence ending address. If the worst should come to tne worst, and the Shaikh should be deprived of his Bashiyah and ffaddaghiyah estates, under the Ottoman Law would it not be open to him, as it would certainly be under English Law, to apply for a stay of execution, and to file a cross suit for the return of the purchase money his grandfather paid for both the properties; it being not denied that the said sale and pur chase was in itself a bone fide transaction ? I understand that the value of the date gardens all over 'Iraq, including the properties in question, has depreciated considerably since 1908, when the Shaikh's grandfather made his purchase. Should, therefore, the defendants in the cross suit not be in possession of the requisite sum sued for by tne Shaikh, ( and they are reported to be penniless), and should they not be able to raise the money on the Shaikh's estates decreed to them because of the fall in the value of land, the Shaikh could then presumably distrain against the defendants/ His lylajesty's Ambassador British Embassy, Bagdad.-2- defendants* takw decreed estates, which would thus once more come into his possession. This envisages a somewhat (iilbertian eTolution 9 but is perhaps not outside the possibilities of the law as practised in 'Iraq. I'he defendants, nowever, in the cross suit might be able to file a suit against tne Shaikh for mesne profits, which presumably Mould more than effect a balance in their farour. The points raised are of some importance as they would seem to affect not only the Shaikh but also the compensation which His Majesty's government may have to pay to the Shaikh on account of his dispossession. 3. It would be interesting, therefore, if your Legal Adviser could very kindly give an opinion as to whether under the Ottoman Law (e) the Shaikh could obtain a sta^ ox execu tion, (b) file the cross suit indicated above and (c) whether the defendants in the cross suit could claim mesne profits. 4 # if a cross suit was filed by the Shaikh the defendants in the Bashiyah case would be the children of Lady Shaf iqa, from whom Shaikh Mubarak originally purchased the property, as given in paragraph 6 of the note enclosed in ^Colonel Dickson* s letter Mo#107 ol 24th May 1^33 to r. ^ Stafford. Of these individuals it is (f) - Rafiah, who filed the suit against the Shaikh, which she won. As far as I know the others have not yet moved in the matter. In the case ol the Faddaghiyah estate the defendants would be (1) Abdullah ibn Isa A1 iiuhair, nephew and (2) Najeeba and ^3) Aida, daughters of Ayesha, wife of Ahmed al Pasha al k»uhair, the original vendor, (vide paragraph 5 of Political Agent, Kuwait*8 letter Mo.114, dated the 31st May 1933, forwarded under thisResidency Printed letter ^o.612-S f dated tiie 7tli June 1933). Of these only Abdullah has filed a suit against the Shaikh of Kuwait, Tide paragraph 1 of despatch Mo # 43 9 dated the 19th January 1933, from His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,London. The two daughters have hitherto taken no legal action but both are believed to be interested and NaJeeba has recently arrived at Basrah from Constantinople. V ■ 5* V/lth reference to Colonel .Dickson^ remarks in / paragraphs 10 and 11 of his letter Ho. 114 quoted abore. The attempt at a compromise on the part of the plaintiffs in their Faddaghiyah suit against the Shaikh is interesting. The explanation is possibly connected with the hypothesis put forward in paragraph 2 above. If the plaintiffs, and more particularly their lawyers who axe apparently acting for their clients on the basis of being paid their fees if the case is won, are doubtful as to what pecuniary benefit - if any - they will get, owing to the drop in land value, even should they win that case, naturally a compromise on a cash basis from the Shaikh would be most welcome to them. 6. Mr. Gabriel's statement, (vide paragraph 14 of Colonel Dickson's letter) that had the Shaikh been properly defended he would have won his Bashiyah case, is very interesting - if correct. Colonel Dickson informs me that Mr. Gabriel has the reputation of being a clever lawyer, with a more than usually thorough knowledge of the complications of Ottoman Law. Mr. Gabriel naturally did not say what the point in Ottoman Law was which if raised in defence would/—— n • 4- would hare won that cfise for the Shaikh, but if it could be discovered eyen now it might not be too late to affect the decision. A hint which Mr. Gabriel let fall to Colonel Dickson indicated that the point has something to do with the type of land involved, and centered round the term 'sirf rnulk'. Perhaps your Legal Adviser may think it worth while to follow this up* I am sending copies of this despatch together with copy of Colonel Dickson^ note referred to in paragraph 4 above, to His Majesty* s Secretary of State for India and the Government of India.

Such deed of gift is known as a H wahbiyeh M , and has down to the present time been considered unasstilable under Ottoman Law. Hence the various later Shaikhs of Kuwait have never attempted to take out Tapu papers for their Fao Estates. Mr. Gabriel pointed out that in his opinion, it was/was very neceesary to-day for the Shaikh to take out Tapu deeds for these Fao Estates, not because the original wwahhiyeh* deeds could be contested, but because it was evident all round that the 'IRAQ Government were interested in bringing pressure on the Shaikhs of Kuwait for political reasons. In his words:' had 'IRAQ, been on friendly terns with Kuwait then there would have been no danger at all H , but as an ♦Iraqi he had to admit that the contrary was the case, end it was clear that the 'Iraq Government was acting and might continue to act in a distinctly unfriendly manner towards Kuwait - hence there was danger. 6. TOien I asked Mr. Gabriel what was the form such danger might take, he replied as follows, ^rhere would be no attack, on the line that the Shaikhs of Kuwait had no Tapu deeds, that line of procedure need not be feared in Law, but •what was to prevent the Mudir of Fao, acting on secret orders from Baghdad (through the Mutasarrif, Basrah^ and stiiring up the fellaheen tenants to commit acts of 'sabotage',I such as cutting down palm trees and selling ttasm samei, refusing to pay rents to their landlord, and lodging a compxaint to Government that they, the fellaheen, were the original owners of the soil, and that their lands had wrongfully been given over to the Shaikhs of Kuwait, and claiming that such lands be restored to them again, (Irish fashionJ. An unfriendly Iraq could easily make it convenient to encourage such complaints, and even assist the fellaheen to bring their case to the Courts and supply them with expert legal advice 1 *. 7^ If such were to happen said Mr.Gabriel, there is no/! ^ ~3~ no knowing what might 'be the eventual result of such proceedings^ hut he opined that it was quite on the cards that the Shaikh of Kuwait would find himself eventually deprived of all his Pao properties, in the same way that many Saadun owners of vast estates on the Euphrates, had in recent years found themselves deprived of half and even more of th^ir lands which had reverted to the tribes (fellaheen) who Originally cultivated the lands, and had for centuries 'been looked upon as , *sarakeel ,, ji^e^ tenants on the land. To counteract such a possible move on the IRA^ Government t b part Mr. Gabriel said it was imperative for the present Shaikh to take out Tapu papers. The great difficulty in doing this said Mr. Gabriel, was that the heirs to-day numbered two or three hundred souls, including a host of women, and that the Shaikh would find it most difficult to get hold of all their names, end have them included in any Tapu deeds taken out» He had nevertheless advised the Shaikh to authorise him to take action on the above lines but for the present the Shaikh, apart from pointing out the almost insurmountable difficulties of such procedure, had done nothing. After Mr# Gabriel's departure the Shaikh dis cussed the matter with me, and said he quite saw the wisdom of Mr. Gabriel's advice but felt the difficulties were too great, and action on his part would be interpreted by the many members of his family to an attempt to rob them of their rights. He was therefore reall^ afraid to act, and must be given time to think* 10. A curious thing recently happened in connection with these Fao Estates. Early in May 1933, the Mutasartff, Basrah, sent a committee down to Fao to examine and value the Shaikh's Fao property. X cannot see whaft ripht he hnd to/-4- to do this, tut he did nevertheless . The property consists of over 6,000 M jarlhs M . A year or two ago a 'jarlV was worth easily Rs.lOOO/-. This would have made the Fao properties worth Rs.60,00,000 or approximately £ 400,000/-* Assuming that the value of land has fallen 'by half, which I do not think is the case, then the value of the property would to-day 'be approximately ^ 200,000/-» The Mutasarrlf•s committee after making their secret investigation valued the Estates at 1»D. 54,000/- or £ 54,000/-, an obviously ridiculous figure. This is an open secret in Basrah to-day• The question is what is behind the move# Both Mr. Gabriel and the Shaikh reported the incident to me and are anxious. 11. The above is reported for what it is worth, but from the anxiety in Mr. Gabriel's voice, when he discussed the business, 1 am inclined to think there isManger** ahead. For the moment things may take their course, but 1 think a reference to the Bnbassy, Baghdad, miggit not be amiss. The trouble is that enquiry from the Embassy might set up an undesirable trend of thought among Iraqi officials - as such matters cannot 'be kept secret long in Baghdad.

I have 'taken up the matt/er in a personal capacity V/itn Feisal and Nuri separately on following lines I I said, urgency 01 settlement of obligations towards Sheikhs was emphasized both by imposition of sales tax and by recent attempt to dispossess Sheikh of Koweit from portion of gardens by legal action. If our gov ernments could not agree among themselves recourse to arbitration seemed inevitable but before advising my government to take this extreme step I proposed to ex plore final possibility of friendly settlement. I as sumed first that if obligations could be satisfactorily disposed of Iraqi Government would be willing to legalize past exemptions. My government were unable to fulfil txxeir promise regarding continuance of possession with out assistance of Iraqi Government. I put forward short draft law which would have the effect of valididating Dobb's grant of Tapu registration for Paddaghiyah garaens. I said if this law was passed and Sheikh was left in undisputed possession I would undertake to try to persuade my government to settle direct with the Sheikh about compensation for taxation subsequent to 1932. I could not of course commit my government as f(&lt;&amp; 2o as if the case went to arbitration they would naturally press their claim that entire obligation devolved on Iraqi Government* Nuri was not hopeful that legislation on these lines would he accepted by Iraqi Governmento The King on the other hand expressed himself as very sympathetic to my proposals and promised to use his utmost en deavours to protect the Sheikh 01 Koweit from being dis possessed of property acquired by bona fide purchasee As regards Bashiyah estate I fear payment of compensa tion is the only remedyo I will keep up pressure but it seems clear that the deal cannot go through before the King leaves for London«OOP',' BENT r 0 K 2527/308/92.

Hurrphrys' telegrams isos, 69 and 70 of April ^nd and 27th concerning the date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikhs of Koweit arid Mohameraho The following were present: Mr. Hendel (in the chair) Mr. Beckett Mr. Kali Mr. Gorell Barnes Foreign office. Lieutenant -Colonel Fowle Political Jesidenb _ in the Persian Guii. Mr. Laithwaite Mr. Crorbie India Office. Mr. Woods Treasury. Mr. Stuart-King Treasury Solicroor's Department. Mr. Blaxter Colonial Office. 1, The meeting opened with a preliminary discussion concerning the desirability oi oi^'i^S persuade the Iraqi Government uo grunt an anti~binu^f.-.ling subsidy to the Sheikh of Koweit. 2o T.icutenxnt Colo nel Fowl a. said that he had discussed the quest ion of smu^clin^ in Bagdad v/ith Sir F. Hurrphrys and Mr. Sievwright (the Director of Cunt or 2, Iraq). Mr. oiev'rrigiit had stated thjt the Iraqi Government took a serious view of the matoei and were ...2. were of the opinion that most of the goods smuggled into Iraq c^me through Koweit (although Colonel Fowle himself was inclined to the view that a considerable proportion came through Saudi-Arabia). Sir Francis Humphrys had expressed the;) opinion that the Iraqi Government would probably be willing to grant the Sheikh an anti-smuggling subsidy, but that they would insist on treating it as a separate question. Furthermore the matter \Afould need careful handling, since it would be necessary on the one hand to satisfy the Iraqi parli^ent that they would receive a definite return for the money voted, and on the other hand to avoid use of the word 'subsidy' or any other term which might imply that the Sheikh was in any sense subordinate to the Iraqi Government. 3, It was agreed that it was desirable that the Sheikh should be granted as large a sum as possible under this head, but that at the most the amount would not represent more than a small proportion of the total compensation which would have to be paid to the Sheikh. An anti-smuggling grant might however help to make a settlement of the whole question some what easier, Mr e Mendel said that it seemed desirable in the first instance to discuss the main question of policy. Sir F. Humphrys' two telegrams shewed that he was strongly opposed to arbitration. His main financial argument against arbitration was that, if they won thoir case, the Iraqi Government would in all probability3. probability claim arrears of taxation since 1921, This argument seemed a strong one c ^ Mr. Beck ett pointed out that such a claim would have to be brought either against His Majesty's Government or against the Sheikhs c If against His Majesty's Government then the Iraqi Government would need to establish that 9 in virtue of Ai'ticle 4 of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty of 1922 they had been obliged to follow the advice of His Majesty's Government in this matterj. and that the advice given to them had been bad advice, entitling them to damageSo Mr c Beckett did not consider it likely that the Iraqi Government would succeed in persuading an International court that they were entitled to damages on account of advice given to them by His Majesty's Government while acting as manda^ tory c Against the Sheikhs, however, the Iraqi Govern ment possibly had a better case: presumably they could merely claim back payments of taxation saying that they had not collected them at the time pending a final settlement of the whole question^ 6, Mr. 'Rennel pointed out that His Majesty's Government would eventually have to pay, whether the case v/as against themselves or against the Sheikhs 6 7. Mr. Beckett agreed. He did not know whether there was a law in Iraq similar to the Statute of Limi tations in this country which v/oul^ limit the date as from which the Iraqi Government coul^ claim arrears of tax from the Sheikh, Use could be made of such a statute if the limit were,say, five years. The claim might0 4 0 might perhaps also be opposed in the case of the Sheikh of Koweit on the ground of the immunity from taxation of a foreign sovereign. in 1930 the Law Officers hai advised that use should be mar^e of this ar^ument c 8, Hr, ^en^el sai^ that the vital point was that oi possession. it was perfectly clear that the pledge given to the Sheikh of Koweit in 1914 covered this point. He ^ not think that the method, of com pensating the Sheikh for dispossession suggested, in paragraph 3 of Sir F e Humphrys 1 telegram No« 70 could be regard as a full or satisfactory discharge of the obligation of His Majesty's Government. it was in any case very uncertain whether an action brought against the heirs of the vendors for the recovery of the origina 1 purchase price woul^ be successful, an^ even if it were successful, whether they would be in a financial position to pay, L-uthv/ait e agreed with this view. He pointed out that the Iraqi claimants might not stop at dispossessing the Sheikh, but might then proceed to being a claim for damages, based upon the profits derived from the estates during the Sheikh's and his predecessor's occupation. 10 « Mr, Beckett thought that even if a claim of this nature were estaolished in the Iraqi Courts, the Judgment coul' 1 not be enforced in view of the Sheikh f s status as a foreign sovereign, it was, of course, conceivableconceivable, as Eros^erted by yr» Hendel and Colonel Fowle. that an attanpt might be made to enforce the judgment by distraint upon the other properties of the Sheikh in Iraq or to recover the Damages through the imposition by the Iraqi Government of extra discrimatory duties on the &gt;heiichs dates, but the claimants were private persons s and it was unlikely that the Iraqi Government would be willing to take or permit measures of doubtful legality against the Sheikh for tho benefit, not of public funds, but of some private persons in whom they had no interest. Mr. H ende l and nolonel o-'le thought that the Iraqi authorities would find maijy means of bringing pressure to bear on the Sheikh if they really wanted to recover arrears from him,, 11, At this point a brief discussion took place between Mr. toods and noloael Fowle concerning the basis upon which compensation should eventually be paid to the Sheikhs. I'lr. V/oods held that the amount of compensation to be paid to the Sheikhs should not be assessed on the basis of discharging an admitted legal liability. In the Treasury view the right course would be to negotiate with the Sheikhs with a view to making the most advantageous bargain possible, n olonel Fowle . on the other hand, was of the opinion that the amount of compensation must ce based upon calculation of the amount of the Sheikh's losses,, 12. Mr,. Rendel said that the basis of com pensation must depend largely upon the final judgments,.,judgments in the Iraqi Courts,, l 7 Dr example, if these included an element of damages, it would be for consideration whether they should be contested on the grounds suggested by Mro Beckett, or whether the amount of cciflpensation must be correspondingly increasedo 13, I v I t ,' , Stu aiSiv Klng said that in his opinion Sir F.ilumphrya overestimated the objections to the validation of the Sheikh of Koweit's title to his date gardens by an administrative or legislative act. Intervention by the Iraqi Government would be fully Justified on the grounds of equity, since, owing to a purely technical flaw in the Sheikh's title, normal process of law would lead to grave injustice, LegiS'- latlon to remedy th3 position need not necessarily refe expressly to the Sheikh of Koweit, but might take the form of a general measure of validation similar to the United Kingdom Act of Indemnity after the war. Such an act would be in accordance with the normal practice of nations, 14, Mr. Hall agreed. He thought that the best course would be to try and make a bargain with the Iraqi Government by offering to take over the liability to compensate the Sheikhs for their future losses under the Isthilak tax provided that the Iraqi Government (a) validated the title of the Sheikh to his Paddaghiyeh estate (b) agreed not to i-aise the question of arrears of taxation and (c) undertook to impose no discriminatory tax upon the Sheikhs in future. 15, Mr,.,., ■7. 15„ EecKett, pointed out that the legal proceedings in the case of the Bushiyeh Gardens were ty no means complete and that the Iraqi Government should therefore, he considered, be asked to validate the ■Sheikh's title to them as well. Admittedly it would he more diificult lor the Iraqi Government to intervene in this case taan in that of the Paddaghiyeh Gardens, since the infirmity of title in the case of the Bushiyeh Gardens could not he ascribed to the war and military occupation. But if these gardens were included when the offer of settlement was made, there would at least be something to abandon as a concession later. 16. Mr. Laithwalte and Colonel Fow le were of the opinion that His Majesty's Government should indicate to Sir Francis Humphrys the desirability of taking a stronger line with the Iraqi Government, if only for tactical reasons and as a first stage. While there was general acceptance of the objections to arbitration if this could be avoided it also seemed arguable that our case was a good one., The record of the Iraqi Government in dealing with this matter had not been very satisfactory and it seemed desirable, even if we did subsequently slightly modify our tactics, to adopt a more definite line with them at this stage and make use of the threat that the matter might have to be taken to arbitration, with results which could hardly be fortunate, unless some disposition to reach an equitable compromise was manifested by them.8o j r.. Rend e l thought that the threat of arbitration v/ould have to he very carerully used as it might prove to 'be more dang^rouo to His Majesty^ G-overnrfient than to the Iraqis. 17 0 M r 0 Stuart- King thought that it would be easier to persuade the Iraqi Government to pass legislation to validate the Sheikh's title 'by explaining that it was in itself a reasonable step^ than by using threataad lo vras the general ODinion of the meetxng that no de^r-iilbe threat of aib.^ ^rai-xon could be made, until further lega]. advice, had been obtained as to the chances of success, should the 'whole question 00 refeired to arbitrationo 18o Mr. V/oods explained that Ministers had not yet been consulted at the Treasury» He felt sure, however, that they would consent to Sir F« Humphrys being instructed to approach the Iraqi G-overnment with an offer of settlement if this would ensure the validation of the Sheikh ! s title, provided he did oO a titre personnel and without prejudice. Mr. Rend el explained that the Foreign Office v^as chiefly concerned with the question of how our pledges could be honoured to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. But as this Sheikh's title was not in question, he agreed that the caso could be dealt with separately. 19o The following wore the conclusions of the meeting agreed to by all present, (1) That a telegram should be sent to Sir F* Humphrys informing him that the first essential was to protect the Sheikh of Kov/eit from dispossession, and that if the Shcikh T s title could be made secure His Majesty's Government would probably agree to waive their claim to tax exemption for the Sheikhs, and would/would arrange themselves to compensate both Sheikhs in respect of future taxation, provided that the Iraqi Government for their part abandoned their claim to arrears of tax and undertook to impose no discriminatory taxation on the Sheikhs in future. In the telegram it should 'be explained that in the circumstanceD intervention by the Iraqi Government would be fully justified on grounds of equity and in accordance with the normal practice of nations 3 though in the case of the Bushiyeh Gardens this argument might be less tenable than m the case oi the Faddaghiyeh Gardens; and Sir F. Humphrys should be instructed to explore the possibility of an amicable settlement on these lines making it clear that he was acting a titre personnel and without prejudicea He should emphasise tne desirability of disposing of this troublesome matter, which might seriously affect the relations between the two Governments, before King Feisal's visit to England in June, and should state that His Majesty s Government took so serious a 'view of the question of possession that it was his personal opinion that, failing an amicable settlement ? they might well feel compelled to refer the whole issue, including the question of taxation, to arbitration. He should point out the serious effect which this would nave on Iraq's international reputation so soon after her admisoion to the League of Nations.. (2) That a second telegram should be sent to Sir F. Humphrys pointing out that it was doubtful whether the method of compensating the Sheikh of Koweit for dispossession suggested in his telegram No. 70 would cemmend itself to His Majesty's Government/10./ (joverment, and asking whether there was any law in Iraq similar to the Statute of Limitations in England, (3) That meanwhile a case should be prepared for the Law Officers with a view to obtaining their opinion as to the chances of success, if the whole question were referred to arbitration.

The correspondence discusses changes in legislation proposed by the Government of Iraq regarding the collection of land rent and land produce duties, and the impact of these proposed changes to the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ. In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī by the British Government in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in World War 1.Much of the correspondence in the file discusses whether or not this assurance can be upheld and how the British should react to the Iraqi government's desire to tax the produce that is grown on Shaikh Ahmad's land and then exported to Kuwait. The file contains direct correspondence between British officials and Nūrī al-Sa‘īd, the Prime Minister of Iraq. The negative impact that the situation had upon Britain's prestige within Kuwait - and the broader implications of this development - are discussed throughout the file.The file contains the minutes of a number of meetings held at the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office with representatives from the Treasury, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the India Office, the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office present between 1932 and 1933. A briefing note marked 'secret' that outlines the various points of dispute between the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Government of Iraq is contained on the file on ff. 78-84.The file also contains details regarding a legal case brought against Shaikh Aḥmad by members of the Al Zuhair family regarding the ownership of some of his land holdings in Iraq.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Land ownership</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001cd#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
