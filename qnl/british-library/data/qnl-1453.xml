In my remarks on ' your statement of affairs,' the causes of the Khan's remaining at Khelat were shown to be ver}^ simple, and his doing so decidedly judicious. The repetition of such a charge, is I consider, very unsuitable, and indicative of a most unfriendly feeling towards His Highness, which I regret to observe, and which, as long as you continue to hold, renders it utterly impossible that relations between the British Govern ment and the ruler of Khelat can be in either a satisfactory or desirable state. Such feeling being strictly contrary to the instructions given you for your guidance, I must desire that you will use every effort to check its continuance, and that you will cease to attribute to His Highness the Khan motives, when you have only your own suppositions to support the statement. 3. The circumstances of the Jamote affair were not at all as stated by you on a former occasion. There was no disturbance whatever between the Khan's troops and the ' powerful Jamote tribe.' A portion of the tribe—the Chief was not present—assembled near Bayla ostensibly in behalf of the fugi tive ex-Jam. The Khan's Governor of Beyla promptly went to the spot, and the Jamotes dispersed without any hostile act whatever. This was such a trivial matter, especially in a District newly taken possession of, that it might well be passed over without any report being made on the subject. Since then I observe His Highness has directed that anything, however trivial, should be reported. 4. It is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs, and one highly prejudicial to the interests of Government, when you devote so much of your time, and take up that of others, by your desire to pull to pieces the reports of the Officer serving immediately under you at the Court of Khelat, instead of accepting those reports as the result of the earnest purpose of that Officer to carry out the important duties entrusted to him. 5. Your 3 last paras, are especially devoted to this object, and because a trivial emeute occurred some months ago on the part of a portion of the Jamote tribe near Beyla, you endeavour to point out that Captain Harrison's statement of the 'improved state of affairs' in Beloochistan was incorrect. And again, because a serious raid by the Murrees was made very recently in Cutchee, you assign it as a direct proof that Captain Harrison's representation of {C quiet existing' was wrong, and that such quiet did not rest on any sound basis. 6. Captain Harrison has nowhere stated the quiet, that existed when he wrote, to be permanent. No one could be so rash as to venture on such a supposition even. And as regards the Murrees making raids into the plains adjacent to them, I would point out that this is not to be wondered at, when the Chiefs of that clan are treated on our side with friendly distinction in spite _of their repeated^ acts of misconduct towards, and open defiance of, their ruler. As I said before, it must seem to them as if we were utterly( C ) indifferent as to what measure of iil-behaviour they committed in the territory of their own Sovereign. This is quite contrary to the practice lon^ followed on the Frontier, and I must require a discontinuance of it. 7. These raids will never be stopped until proper measures are completed, now under consideration as you know. Meanwhile I have to desire that no further notice be taken of, or allowed towards, the Murree tribe, by any one on our side, until full reparation has been made by them for this gross outrage. 8. I have also to request you will submit to me, with the least possible delay, a detailed account of this inroad, showing the section of the Murree tribe who perpetrated it, the part of the Murree hills they came from, the route they took, the places or exact neighbourhood they visited, and the amount of cattle they carried off, as well as to what particular tribes the cattle belontjed. O 9. In conclusion, and reverting to the subject of my 4th paragraph, I would call on you to consider carefully whether the course you have adopted towards Captain Harrison is—apart from its being contrary to the instructions laid down for your, and his, guidance—either just, or generous. That Officer, placed as he is in a most delicate and trying position in the performance of the duties, of which he has received the approbation of Government, and con tinues to command mine, as he will also I trust obtain a renewal of that of Government, should fairly look to you for support and encouragement. I regret to say the contrary has become your custom, and in place of aiding him with your countenance and protection, you do all in your power to depreciate and nullify his zealous efforts. I have been always most willing and ready to give you my best support in every respect, hut in the line you are now pursuing, so directly opposed to my orders, such can no longer be the case.

Merewether goes on to state that he views the Khan's offer to come to Cutchee [Kutch] to meet with British officials, and his reasons for wishing to stay at Khelat as natural and proper and that the Colonel should have abstained from refering to his assertions of the previous December that the Khan had been a virtual prisoner in his citadel since 1865.The letter goes on to correct Colonel Phayre on the facts relating to the incident at Beyla [Bela] stating that there was no confrontation of troops, the members of the Jamote tribe that had gathered there had done so without their Chief and dispersed once the Khan's Governor of Beyla arrived and that it was such a trivial incident that the Governor had most likely considered there to be nothing worth reporting in it.The letter then discusses the recent attack by the Murree tribe, correcting some of Colonel Phayre's 'suppositions' in relation to it and requesting a detailed account showing the section of the tribe that perpetrated it, the part of the Murree hills they came from, the route they took, the exact places plundered and the amounts of cattle taken, along with details of the tribes it was taken from.The letter concludes by again requesting that Colonel Phayre consider whether the attitude he has been taking regarding Captain Charles Henry Harrison is either just or fair.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000020#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
