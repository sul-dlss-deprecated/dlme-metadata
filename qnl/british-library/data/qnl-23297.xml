Dear Mr. Rendel, I do not know whether I ought to bring these facts to your notice, but it is very simple to tear up the letter if the point is of no interest. Our Manager in Cairo, who recently went along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf met a number of people, who told him about a young German v/ho was apparently working his passage from point to point and making at the same time a pretty good survey of the resources of the west side of the Gulf. His name was Gerhardt Breisnick. He is believed to be from Berlin University, aged about 20, and said he was studying psychology and character building. He has been to Baghdad visiting UR and had come from Basrah to Bahrain in a dhow. He is said to have asked a number of questions re garding our operations. Yours, etc.» ( d.) H.

The Residency, Bushire, the 19th April,1933 Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter dated the 21st March 1933 about a young German named Breisnick. with another German student named F. Rosenthal on the 28th December 1932. It was understood that they had come down the Tigris in a canoe. They proposed to go to India by way of Bahrain and Muscat. Rosenthal had apparently been refused a visa for India by the British Consul at Basrah as he could not prove that he had any means, he was, therefore, refused a visa at Kuwait also. Breisnick’s passport hore a visa for India given by the British Consul in Berlin, so he was given a visa to Bahrain. 3. I saw Breisnick when he passed through Bahrain, where Dr. Dame of the American Mission allowed him to use a bed in the European room of their Hospital, neither the Missionaries nor I found any reason to think that he was other than a student of the ’hiker* type, keen to see the world and possibly collecting material for a thesis. 4. He proposed to go on to India by dhow by way of the Trucial Coast and Muscat, but readily accepted my land Dr. Dame’s) advice to make this part of his journey by steamer. 5. Dr. Dame has since had a line from him from l I think) Lahore* 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe. 2. Breisnick arrived at Kuwait by sailing boat in company Yours sincerely lSd.) G.
