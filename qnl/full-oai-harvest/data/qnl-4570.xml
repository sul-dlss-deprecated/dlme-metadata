The papers cover subscriptions collected and coordinated by the Political Agency, and from 1938, the sale of poppies in Bahrain, usually undertaken by the wives of British officials. The file’s principal correspondents are: the Political Agent in Bahrain (numerous incumbents); the British Legion (Organising Secretary Captain W G Willcox, and President of the Legion, Sir Frederick Barton Maurice); and Lady Marjorie Lepel Belgrave, wife of Charles Dalrymple Belgrave.The file contains a range of printed materials, published by the British Legion, including:leaflets promoting the Legion’s work and its campaigns (ff 9-10, ff 12-15, ff 21-27, f 41, ff 76-79, ff 99-100, ff 117-118);an annual report of accounts for the British Legion for 1934 (ff 39-40);Haig Fund poppy wreath catalogues (f 98, ff 101-102).A letter from the Political Agent (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch) to the Organising Secretary of the British Legion, dated 12 January 1938 (f 91) notes that it had ‘hitherto been regarded as undesirable that Poppies should be sold in Bahrain. Such objections as there may have been no longer [exist]; and I shall hope to receive Poppies from you in future.’</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Marjorie Lepel Belgrave</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>The Royal British Legion</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Charities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fundraising</topic></subject><subject><topic>Remembrance day (UK)</topic></subject><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000125#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000125#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000125#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000125#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
