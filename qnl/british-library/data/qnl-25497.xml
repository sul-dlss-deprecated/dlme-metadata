Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant,- TFEAr JFY OHIStBISS, 23218 13 54790 DEC 4 i9I5, P ttL December 1913. Sir, I have laid before the Lords Commineioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Sir Fyre Orowe f g letter of the 22nd ultimo (No.52284/13), with enclosure, relative to a proposal that a sum of 210,000 should be advanced by the British, Indian and 'Russian Governments to meet the cost of erecting boundary pillars on the Turco-Persian frontier, the money ultimately to be recovered from the Ottoman and Persian Governments. In reply I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir P. Grey that Fy Lords would be glad to have some details as to how the estimate of £10,000, which appears to be some what high, has been arrived at. As regards the alleged necessity for relieving Turkey and Persia from meeting the expenditure on the pillars in the first instance I am to observe that, judging from Lr. Iratislaw’s letter,there is no sufficient reason to anticipate that Turkey will not be able to meet its obligations immediate ly and in these circumstances^'y Lords see no justification for undertaking any resnonsibility on its behalf. The capacity of the Persian Government to meet the demands on them is more doubtfu^but even in their case it is by no means clear to Their Lordships that, considering now small is the sum required,it will not be forthcoming. In this connection I am to point out that since February 1912 a sum of £220,000 has been advanced to Persia and I am to enquire whether, in view of this, it would not be possible to obtain from the Persian Government a guarantee that the necessary funds will be provided for the erection of pillars. Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.o If this course prove impracticable the next best alternative i in Their Lordships f opinion, would be that authority should be given to the British Indian Delegation on the Boundary Commission to advance cash (provided by India in the first instance) on the spot from time to time as required, and that the Indian Government and the Secretary of State should arrange to recover any such advances (which should not exceed £2 f 5G0 in the aggregate, the Russian Gov ernment presumably assisting Persia to the same extent) at once out of the surplus of the Persian Southern Customs. If this method were adopted l*y Lords would be willing that the payment of interest on these purely temporary advances should be waived. Failing this arrangement My Lords consider that the best course to adopt would be for India to advance from time to time as required within a limit of £2,503 and recover the moiety from the Diplomatic and Consular /ote. The amount, if any, which India would wish to recover on this account during the current financial year would be so small as to be capable. My Lords presume, of being met from the provision on the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. As regards the interest to be charged on advances made under this scheme, which Sir ... Grey will note, 'Rieir Lordships regard as less satisfactory than the other alternatives mentioned in my letter, I am to say that the best plan would be to consolidate the advances with those already made to Persia and to charge the like inter est thereon, viz: 6 per cent.(WtfX/lo) Jtii ,i&gt;Gw« will taka Uwaa at l«aat fiftuaii di^o to porfons tho journey to ’ohu-werah enw unlow a they can roach that plac# hy i.aooi.«hor 51ot. at la toot, the approach of winter will render work in curtain portions of the frontier iapossible, thereby eeuain,, a caost eoriaua ar.o inconronient coia^ no. inci dentally . addirtg vary naoviiy to the coot of »aintainin(j the .ritiah portion of the Uoseiaaion. dir A, Urey is theroforo reluctantly compelled to uak tiia Lords ilooniaoionaro of the Treoaury to take the matter into vary aerious consideration said to sanction provieionally tho itraediato advance of »'wo thouawK’. five hundred pounds in the tsaiuior si\y;ested in tiic fifth of jour latter ui.der reply, with the modification tluit hie lajoat/a ; inistur at fehron should first de authoriaac to advance out of this .wo thousand five hundred poiwica eufficient funds t- 1 aeiid the i eraian CkmKieai onsra from Vetoran to oharamerah. .4r h, iirey is informing the Buaaian Jorernaent and tiw India Office of the situation end will urgo tiiat the uueien- -?

I on to request that you will convey to their Lordships the profound disappointment of the Secretary of State that, notwithstanding the pressing considera tions of policy, expediency, and ultinste economy ex plained in my letter of December 5th, the Lords Commissioners have seen fit to make their assent to a provisional advance of Two thousaivl five hundred pounds (of which it is stipulated that One thousand two hundred and fifty pounds should be provided from Indian funds) conditional upon a stipulation as to savings from the Diplomatic and Consular vote, which renders The Secretary to the Treasury. the assent of Their Lordships nugatory and ineffectual.— - ■ ' ' 1 ( 557iiii/l5) 000 since it is Inpossibla to say at present whether such a saving could be effected during the rest of the current financial year or not. It is at present doubtful whether the Oomission of Del imitation will, within the short period (hiring which it is possible, owing to climatic conditions, for writ to be done in the south, be able to complete the work south of Zohab without proceeding to ^ount Ararat and undertaking the northern survey first; should such a course be rendered necessary,- and each additional day of delay makes it more likely to be so - His Majesty’s Government will be Involved in an additional expenditure which, at a modest computation, may be fixed at Ten thousand pounds* It is, therefore, eminent ly desirable in the Interests of public economy alone that delay should be averted. Apart from this there are weighty political reasons which, in the judgment of Sir k• ‘^re./, inspol to expedition, and cannot be safely disregardod.

I an to add that the Pubs! an Government on their part have actually advanced over ^ive thousand pounds (Fifty thousand, roubles) to the Persian Government for the expenses of the Commission, and that the delay in advancing the British share has produced an unfavour able impression upon the Russian Government, who are naturally unable to appreciate the grounds of delay when the incentives to expedition are so convincing.

Sir:- I have the honour to draw your attention to the provision made in the Feglement Intferieur for the Turco-Perslan Frontier Commission (Annex A. to the Protocol) for the payment of the expenses of erecting boundary marks along the frontier. Mr. Minorsky and I provided so far as we could for any likely difficulties by laying down that the Corn- mission should estimate the amount likely to be re quired for each section of the frontier, and that the Turkish and Persian Commissioners should pay down the amount in equal shares. This seems a satisfactory arrangement and no doubt it is so in theory; but it unfortunately depends in practice on the parties concerned being in possession of the requisite funds. The Turkish Commissioners assured us that they would be given drafts on the provincial Governors to meat such expenses and that they would moreover be able to The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.to supply military labour; but T am somewhat doubtful regarding the Persians, and It is important, in order to avoid delay , that they should be in a position to pay their shares on the spot.

Foreign Office, December 2, 1913, 2*45 p.m. MY telegram No. 462 of 18th November : Tiirco-Persian frontier. I am consulting Treasury about a joint Anglo-Russian advance of 10,00()Z. to be furnished to British and Russian frontier commissioners in order that they may meet initial cost of erecting boundary marks, such cost to be repaid by Persia and Turkey in due course. Do you consider it will be necessary to divert any part of this sum in order to meet expenses of Persian commissioners, or will funds be available from Persian Government ? The latter course would of course be preferable. Are you satisfied that staff of Persian commissioner will be at Mohammerah by 15th December ?
