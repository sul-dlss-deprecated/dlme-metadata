Kef« p/282 y M *' D®*r Residency, please refer to your letter No.162/24/49 of the 23rd September concerning Muscat subjects killed in Hyderabad. 2 We have made one or two enquiries of this nature of the Government of India about Aden subjects in Hyderabad and of Hyderabad is a relatively efficient one and the Military Government according to available evidence has treated the Arab population fairly; but what success a request for information about events so far in the past would have, or what consideration would be given to any claim for compensation or recovery, we are not in a position to say. 3. In view of the fact that the Sultan of Muscat is visiting India shortly, we feel that the most suitable course would be for him to approach the Indian Government himself on this matter, and would therefore suggest that the Sultan might raise it with them when he is in Delhi. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Eastern De partment of the Foreign office, and to the Commonwealth Relations Office. replies have been received in due course.
