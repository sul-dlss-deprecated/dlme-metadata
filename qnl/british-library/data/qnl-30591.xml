I have to inform you that£all services at present being operated by us are essential war communications, and that we cannot change our schedule or ports of call without reference to higher authority^ I suggest therefore that you should approach the External Affairs Department, Government of India, who will no doubt in turn refer the matter to the Air Ministry. To save time we will also refer your enquiry to Delhi immediate ly and will let you know the result. 3.

To No.C/jfj^f Dated the 23rd April 1944. Following for Director-General of Posts &amp; Telegraphs. Sea mails from and to India for various reasons arc now very irregular and usually at intervals of well over one month. Since Muscat is only 100 sea miles from Ras al Hadd aerodrome, of tue South Arabian Air route, it has been proposed that air mail facilities be provided there through0.A.C. who are willing to oooperatc. R.A.F. contractor would collect mails and transport to and from Muscat by launch weekly. There would be no Post Office at Ras al Hadd and all mails would be closed and delivered at Muscat Post Office. Extra expenditure would be about Ks. 12,000 per annum against which is present profit of local Post Office, about Hs.4,000 per year, and air mail surcharge. This however probably not sufficient but local Government and merchants would so appreciate these facilities that they are prepared to cover extra cost. 2. I am instructed by Political Resident, Persian Gulf to ask your comments on and sanction for aoove, which would satisfy a pressing local need. Arrangement only required until weekly sea mails are resumed. Political -Telegram - S From - Political Agent, Muscat. To - Government of India, New Delhi. Repeated - Political Resident, Busn.ire.

Muscat was said in 1944 to have been 'ill supplied with mail facilities for many months, resulting in serious delays in delivery of official mail and excessive expenditure on telegrams' (folio 45). The commercial community of Muscat was also affected, and offered to pay for improvements.The papers include: a petition from members of the commercial community of Muscat, calling for the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) service to and from India via Masirah to make an extra stop at Ras al Hadd [Ra’s al Ḩadd], so that mails and passengers could be brought from there to Muscat by launch (folios 2-3); the proposed involvement of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the collection of mails at Ras al Hadd; discussion of the proposals in correspondence between the Political Agent, Muscat, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Government of India, RAF Aden, and RAF Masirah; correspondence concerning the provision of guards for the service; and proposals for the transmission of official mail from Ras al Hadd to India via Bahrain, and vice versa.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Ras al Hadd</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Air mail</topic></subject><subject><topic>Overseas mail</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000b8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
