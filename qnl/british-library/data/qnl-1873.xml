EASTERN COMMITTEE. Mesopotamia: Civil Administration. (Kotk by Political Department, India Office.) I. It will be remembered that Sir Percy ('ox was authorised in August 1917, when his status was altered from that of Chief Political Officer on the fetalf of the General Officer Commanding to that of ( ivil ('ommissioner, Mesopotamia, to submit periodical reports direct to His Majesty's ( iovernment on general administrative questions in th e occupied territory. Five such reports have been received up to date. The following brief analysis of their contents may be useful to the Committee, in view of the forthcoming discussions with Sir P. Cox, as a general indication of the lines on which the civil administration of the country is being developed. 2. Ftrst Jieport, 'period ending \ijth November, 1917. (i) Tribal Affairs.—Relations with outlying tribes on the whole proceeding satisfactorily. Estimated that 'there are now 100,000 Heduin in our western ' frontier depending on Iraq for their supplies. This immigration of tribes to our ' sphere would be satisfactory, in that it deprives the Turks of their co-operation ' and support, but it necessarily accentuates the difficulty of the food problem.' The capture of Ramadieh let! to the submission of two leading chief's of the Dulaim tribe, both of whom had previously been in co-operation with the Turks. (ii) Irrigation and Agriculture,—Satisfactory progress reported on various irriga- tional works on the Tigris and Euphrates. Arrangements made for the construction of a himd on the Hindiyah river which 'will feed 25 minor canals and bring under cultivation some 40,000—50,000 acres.' Work undertaken on the Husainiyah canal (Euphrates right bank) which feeds Kerbela ; anticipated that ' three times the ' maximum quantity of land cultivated since war broke out will be cultivated this ' year, though this will still fall a little short of previous past years. Efforts are ' being made to make up the deficiency, the main difficulty being one of transport.' The Shujair bund, on the right bank of the Tigris above Bagheilah, completed 11th October 1917 at a cost of something over 2,0001. ; this work, ' which presented unusual difficulties,' is described as ' essential to the conservancy of the river as well as to the agricultural needs of the districts. ' The bioid had been breached by the Turks in 1916, and if the work of reparation had not been undertaken, ' the ' tribes would not have returned to this section of the river, and a rich agricultural ' area would have been again subjected to disastrous inundations.' On the Diyalah river, SO tons of seed already distributed, and arrangements made to provide another 720 tons. (iii) Land Revenue. -Revenue receipts to the end of October 1917 amounted approximately to Us.,7,00,000 (47,00()Z.) in cash and Rs. 8,00,000 (53,000/.) in kind. (iv) Supplies.—Difficulties reported in connection with the control of the Baghdad food supply and the consequent blockade, ' which has in some cases resulted in the seizure of seed grain while being taken out of Baghdad. ' A system of passes has been instituted, and it is hoped that trouble has been averted. The pressure of Heduin demands led recently to disturbances between the Anizah and the townsfolk of Nejef, where the stocks of grain are dangerously ' small.' The local Government agent (relation of Aga Khan) failed to cope with the ' situation. The question of what measures can be taken to prevent an unfavourable ' situation arising at Nejef is under consideration.' [See paragraph 0 (ii). S 10 40 4/18(Vl Education— Opening of six Govermnent primary schools, with lotal average i V t.r 1()() oucils, reported.

A local agricultural committee lias been formed at Kerbela to advise the Political Oificer in agricultural matters on the Husainiyah Canal. Steps have been taken to provide the Political Ollicer with wheat and barley seed. 'Progress reports from this area are particularly satisfactory. 1 ' Large quantities of seed have also been distributed on the Tigris and Diyalah. The Political Officer at Knt reports that the fella]i are ' rapidly settling to agricultural work.' On the Diyalah, the Turkish methods of irrigation have been developed and improved, and 'satisfaction is expressed at the methods of water distribution which are being followed.' (v) Customs.— ' Customs are showing steady increase, and the receipts in Baghdad alone now average over 1,000/.. a month. A proposal for the reorganisation of the Customs establishment is being prepared.' (vi) Supplies— A shortage of supplies is reported in various districts, e.g., Kadhimain, Ramadieh, Hillah, and Samawah. Special steps are being taken to deal with the situation. (vii) Kducation. —Good reports received of the first batch of students from the Survey School. Three new primary schools opened, one of them (at Diwaniyah) started by the people themselves, assisted by a monthly grant from'( Jovernment. (viii) Wanfs.—' Hie administration of the Shiah Auqaf in Kerbela and Xejef under Hritish supervision is showing excellent results, and for the iirst time since the occupation the accounts show a balance to credit.' (ix) Sanitation.— A comprehensive scheme for improving the water-supply at Baghdad is under consideration. The military authorities have detailed an Indian medical officer for civil work at Ramadieh ; a dispensary has been opened there and all children vaccinated. 4 ' The townsfolk welcome vaccination.' (x) Memorial to Sir Stanley Maude.— The proposal to erect a suitable memorial to the late Sir Stanley Maude evoked great enthusiasm. More than Rs 150,000 (10,000L) was subscribed for the purpose in a short time. 4. Third Tieport, period ending ibth December 1917. (i) Tribal Affairs.— The paramount Chief of the Zubaid, the Sheikh of the Khafajah and other chiefs approached the Political Officer, Nasiriyeh, with a view to making their submission. A Jazirah Shammar chief returned from a year's visit to the Hejaz. He spoke with enthusiasm of his reception and of King Hussain's dealings with the Arabs in general. He visited Bin Saud on his return journey, and was hospitably entertained at Riadh. (ii) Affairs on the Euphrates. —The Civij Commissioner visited Hillah, Tuwairij, Kufah, Nejef, and Kerbela during the first week of December. He saw ' no likelihood* ' of any serious rising on the part ol the Euphrates tribes, nine-tenths ol whom ' appreciate what is being done to promote agriculture, and are anxious for the ' provision of administrative arrangements strong enough to ensure tranquillity and ' enable them to sow and reap their crops undisturbed.' At the same time he considered it 'necessary to have sufficient show of effective authority to overawe the ' unruly tenth and strengthen the position of the well-disposed majority. It was decided in principle to control the Shinafiyah -Samawah line by placing detachments of troops at these places and maintaining a river patrol by gunboats from Nasiriyah; also to locate detachments at Hillah, Kill, Kufah and Abu Sukhair, in addition to those already stationed at Mufraz (above Musaiyih) and at the Hindiyah Barrage. Sir P. Cox considered it undesirable to place troops at Nejef. (hi) Land Revenue. —Cash receipts up to date amounted to Hs. 940,000 (03,000?.).4 (iv) Irrigation and Agriculture. — Kstimnt.e for the forward area :—GOO,OCX) acres under cultivation with an estimated yield of 280,000 tons of grain. Question of providing a separate workshop lor agricultural macliineij undei coiisidnution. Canals on the Euphrates reported to he ' now almost all flowing,' though there is still a shortage of cultivators in the Minor Canals district. Reports from the Diyalah valley less satisfactory ; 'in spite of all efforts to encourage cultivation, the amount of land sown this year will not compare favourably with that which was under 44 cultivation last season.' The area suffered from Turkish depredations during the summer, and the tribes consequently migrated from the canals. Many have not yet returned, and 'agricultural labour is insufficient. Measures have been taken to develop vegetable cultivation. (v) Cotton.— A cotton expert (Mr. J. Thomas) arrived from India, and is touring the country to select a site for a cotton farm. (vi) Education.—2,000 books received from India for use in schools. A municipal primary school opened at Kadhimain, under the auspices of the Political Officer, the teachers being men selected by the local notables; 88 boys have been registered, and the average attendance is &lt;&lt;S. J he notables consider tliat, i f Kvgish were 1 aught, the number of scholars would at once increase. ' In order to supply the lack of teachers both for Kadhimain and for other places where a ' Shiah teacher would be more acceptable than a Sunni, the 1 olitical (Miicer, ' Kadhimain, has induced seven or eight young Shiahs to enter the Teachers 7 ' Training School, 1 and is paying the cost of Apparently tlie '■ Normal Sdiool ' their daily journey to Baghdad and back out ln&lt; 'of private funds. Several of these students ' show promise and should do well; and in any case, to have broken with the '* tradition that only Sunnis should attend the (Jovernment Training School is a ' notable advance.'' (vii) Sanitation.—Large numbers of children have been vaccinated in the Baqubah district (Diyalah valley). 5. Fourth Report, period ending 1st Decemher 101 &lt;. (i) Tribal Affairs.—Lieut.-Col. Magniac murdered near Mufraz on the Euphrates ■while engaged on a reconnaissance. Two of the principal culprits (belonging to a section of the Dulaim tribe) arrested. Continued progress reported in the Hammar Lake region. 'Some time nmpt ' elapse before the tribes of the Lower Euphrates can be described as model ' agricultural communities, but the advance in that direction, which has been made ' during the past year, is encouraging.' These tribes were completely out of hand for many years before the war, and the condition of the marsh country was one of chaos. Thanks to the efforts of the British Political officers, order is being slowly restored, and inter-tribal disputes and blood-feuds are being successfully dealt with. ' The closing of the Akaikah dam, which had been removed in order to facilitate our ' transport, has been of the greatest benefit to the cultivators .... and the ' appreciation which it has earned from the tribes is an asset politically. 1 he crying need of the district is an experienced engineer to direct local irrigation schemes. Conditions in Suq town generally satisfactory ; but additional sanitary conve niences are required, and the Civil Dispensary lacks competent medical assistants. A good deal of difficulty has been experienced at Chabaish (on the old Euphrates channel above its junction with Qurnah). The local Sheikh, whom we found in possession on our arrival, was a strong and popular Chief. But he persisted in pro-Turkish activities and had to be deported to India. His brother, whom we set up in his stead, was promptly murdered ; and his nephew, to whom we next had recourse, proved quite incompetent. He was accordingly replaced by a Mvdir; the latter was favourably received, and the situation at Chabaish 'is already beginning to improve.' The exiled Sheikh has behaved well in India, where he has been well treated, and it is hoped that it may be found possible to reinstate him after the war. (ii) Affairs on the Persian Frontier.— Following on the occupation jjf Khaniqin, Major Soane was posted there as Political Officer and arrived on the 7th December.5 As a result of Turkish and Russian exactions, the population of the district had been reduced, at the time of our occupation, to about one-third oi its normal hgure. On our arrival the refugees at once began to return, and the problem ol supply became acute 'As military considerations are held to preclude our giving out that we ' intend to remain, or to allow, or give 'seed for, cultivation which we cannot under- 44 take to protect, the political situation at present is ditiicult.' Maintenance ol a detachment of irregulars to preserve order locally lias been appioved. 1 The situation at Bedrah, which lies midway between kut and Mcndeli iias long been unsatisfactory owing to friction between the 1'ersian and Arab elements, and 1o the existence of a strong pro-Turkish party in the town. It has been decided to post an assistant political officer there, a step which the well-disposed among the inhabitants have repeatedly begged us to take. Incidentally, it is hoped that t ic presence of a British official will exert a steadying influence on the \ all ot 1 usht-i-Kuli (on the Persian side of the frontier), whose winter quarters are only three hours journey from Hedrah, and who owns considerable private piopcity m tho town. (ill) Land Kevenue.—Cash receipts up to date, Rs. 10,53,174 (70,&lt;»()()/.). (iv) Irrigation and Agriculture.-- ' Expert military officers on the Vegetable Pro- 41 duction Staff are giving invaluable assistance in agricultural matters generally. 44 An officer has been appointed Agricultural Adviser to the Administrator, A.D. 4k Scheme, and Circle otlicers have been appointed for the Euphrates, the Tigris down 44 to Kut, and for the Basra Vilayet.' ( 44 Harvesters,' with necessary staff, are under order from Australia. 1 lie 44 threshing and clecin delivery ot the grain, which will he alToided by these machines, ' should be a most important factor in the speedy disposal of next year's crop.' No further progress made in regard to other agricultural machmei}. The organisation required for handling 44 the enormous crop that is anticipated on the Euphrates' is receiving attention. No details yet worked out. Good progress reported on the Euphrates Irrigation scheme, ' a pleasing note 44 being the new interest taken by land-owners in the development of lands, which, 44 under the Turkish administration, they had been content to leave untended.' On the Diyalah, much satisfaction caused among the Arabs by improved irrigation arrangements ; but seed distribution in the the l&gt;aquhah district as a whole fioi proceeding as rapidly as could be wished. (v) Cotton. The cotton already grown at Hillah has been reported on most favourably by the Cotton Expert from India. G. Fifth Report, period ending ibth J an nary 1018. (i) Tribal Affairs.—Relations with the Kurdish tribes on the Persian frontier, north of Khaniqin, described as ' still precarious.' Difficulty experienced with the powerful Sinjabi tribe, who are preventing the passage of food to Khaniqin. r i he head of the tribe, Ali Akbar Sinjabi, is known to have entertained German agents and to be in constant communication with the enemy ; also harbouring the pro- German Persian democrat, Sulaiman Mirza. 'The elimination of Sulaiman would 44 probably result in All Akbar s adhesion to ourselves, and would go iai to quiet, the 44 frontier.' [N.B.—Sulaiman has since been ' eliminated.' ] Submission reported of a powerful Chief bi the Muntalik league, forinerlv one ol the most actively hostile of the JVIuntalik Sheikhs. T he t hief of the Sanai, desciibed as 44 the most whole-heated lurkish adherent among the Hem Kabiah Sheikhs, has submitted unconditionally. With two exceptions, all the leading Sheikhs who were out against us in the Jazirah, i.e., the area between the 1 igris and the Euphrates, have now made submission. (ii) Affairs at Nejef.—Subsequent to the ejection of the 1 urks, the control ol Nejef passed into the hands ol certain tribal sheikhs, who administered the town with great advantage to themselves and little benefit to Nejef. Disturbances ensued, and the local government agent (a member of the Aga Khan s family) found himself 1 A.i). apparently stands for Agricultural Development.

On the the occasion of the transfer of the I ivd ( omnussioner a headquarters to Baghdad, Captain Wilson (Depntv Civil omniissioner) was entertained at several gatherings by the notables of the Basra district He reported that the people of the district 'seem to have accepted the Jmtish occupation as an accomplished fact, and are now occupied with livelv anticipations ol the advantages which may result.' He detected no nnderlviii' hostility ; the rapid development of Basra from the material point of view had ^ tun ed the mmd ol all classes m a practical direction, and all are anxious to share in tn,; improvements introduced.'

Thev were .-reaHv (bsttubed by rumours in the press suggesting that the future of Mesopotamia ^voidd be a question lor the decision of the Peace Conference. r ^ The -Labour Question .-The main complaint made by the Basra notables to ap am \\ dson (see preceding section) was of the heavy military demands on the bo ''! ^'PPb'. which had led to a serious shortage of labour for agricultural purposes ((late cultivation in particular). Landowners urged that our demands in this respect should cease with the war, and that the labour required for militarv deniobdisation and for development ' should be sought in Persia, India, or elsewheie „ ' 0 as t ' &gt; .

(ill) Administration of Justice, Baghdad Vilayet—A report was received in March 1918 describing the arrangements provisionally made for the judicial administration of the Baghdad Vilayet, pending the arrival of the Senior Judicial Officer (Mr; Honhain Carter) appointed from the Soudan. The following is a brief summary On the occupation of l^aghdad nearly the whole personnel of the* Turkish judiciary was found to have fled, and even the buildings and furniture of the Courts had .been looted or destroyed. Most of the records of the Turkish Tapn (Land Administration) Department had also disappeared. It soon became necessary to introduce some ionn of judicial machinery, and a start was accordingly made by reopening a ' i'eace Court ' at Baghdad, for which a suitable Judge was found in the person ol an Arab notable. His^ work appears to have been eminently satisfactory. A Qadhi and Assistant Qadhi were also appointed to act in all Sunni cases, and in cases m which Shiahs accepted him as judge. Appeals from these Courts lay to that oi the * i\il Commissioner, the only otner court of law m l&gt;aghdad. Outside Baghdad itself, judicial work was largely left to the Political officers. A Qadhl was appointed at Baqubah to decide ' Shara (/•«., religious la\\) cases. In the Hillah district the Political Officer was provided with a judicial assistant in the person of a voung Arab of one of the leading Baghdad families; and a ' Peace Board ' was also formed for tlie purpose of composing disputes out of court. Owing to the many difficulties arising out of questions of tenure, proprietorship, claims for rent, c^c., cases relating to laiul were removed from the jurisdiction of all the courts. Land suits are heard exclusively by political officers, whose ' enquiries are ' limited to an endeavour to restore to, or maintain in, possession the person who, but ' for the disturbances of war, would have been in possession. Xo attempt is being ' made to reach an ultimate decision.' _ . ,, , , [Mr Bonham Carter actually assumed charge as Senior Judicial Officer, haghuad, in October 1917, and before the end of the year (28th December 1917) a proclamation was issued by General Marshall formally re-establishing the Civil Courts of the Baghdad Vilayet. The proclamation provides for the institution of Courts of First Instance in the Baghdad and other districts, and of a Court of Appeal at Baghdad: also for the establishment of Muhammadan Law Oourts throughout the \ jlayet. ('riminal cases and land suits are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts. It is understood that the Court of First Instance at Baghdad is now sitting under a British President.] (iv) Irrigation and Supply— A report on this subject was received in .lannary UH8. 'The distribution of water is beyond all comparison the most important admini- ' trative problem in the Iraq. Scientiiic control of the two rivers means not only ' economic progress but it is also the first step towards the pacification of the ' tribes .... Apart from its administrative aspect, the irrigation question lias ' an immediate bearing upon military needs, and the food-supplying capacity ol the ' Iraq i? an element in the universal problem of combating the shortage caused by ' the war.' ..... i o- wir Of the comprehensive scheme for Mesopotamian irrigation drawn up hv on \\ ilii.iin Willcocks, the construction of the Hindiyah barrage was the only item taken in hand before the war. The barrage itself had been completed and handed over to the Turkish authorities early in 1914, but the supplementary works on which its irn- gational value depended had barely been begun. After the British occupation, an engineering expert was sent to examine the barrage in May 1917. lie reported that, unTess the existing works received proper care and supervision, great damage and loss would result; and he strongly recommended the completion ol the llindiyah scheme, as planned by Sir W. W.illcocks, 'both as a means of satisfying and quieting the tribes and because of the. increase of food and revenue that would result. J lis recommendations were sanctioned bv the military authorities. It was estimated that the proposed works would cost lis. 1,000,000 (()7,000L), but would bring in a revenue of Us. 1,400,000 (93,000L), i.e., that the whole outlay would be more than covered by the lirst harvest. ...... , . Improvements in the Husainiyah canal, from which the kerbela district derives its water supply, were undertaken at the request of the people of Kerbela. The recon-8 struction of the dam cm the Suklilawiyah river, which joins the Euphrates midway between Feluja and Ramadieh, has also l)eeu carried out. 'As the summer of 1917 advanced the problem of food supply became increasingly urgent ; and it was found necessary, both in the interests of the Army of Occupation and of the native population, to devise means of developing agriculture so as to ensure a good harvest in 1918. After careful consideration a scheme was sanctioned providing for the survey of canals commanding an area of 000,000 acres, mainly in the Hindiyah vicinity, and for advances to cultivators both in seed and in cash for the purchase of agricultural implements. Expenditure was limited to a maximum of 400,000/. The probable production of grain was estimated at over '&gt;00,000 tons, of which the total value of the Government share would be not less than 500,000/. ' After the needs of the cultivators have been supplied there will still be a large ' surplus, amounting to rather more than a third of the whole crop, which will be ' available for sale.' Supervision of the working of the scheme was entrusted to the Revenue Department, with a personnel strengthened by additional political officers and native employes, and working locally through the existing svstem of Mavrurs in sub-divisions of districts. It may be added that the general control of irrigation in the occupied territories was placed in January 1918 under a military Directorate, subordinate the (leneral- Officer Cofnmanding in Chief. This step was taken with the concurrence of the Civil Commissioner, who considered that it would ' adequately safeguard the interests of the Civil administration.' (v) Restriction of Alienation of Land. —A notification w r as issued by the Civil Commissioner in November 1917, prohibiting the alienation of immovable property to- persons 'other than Arabs of the occupied territories,' except with the previous sanction in writing of the military authorities. The object of this measure was ' to prevent far-reaching changes in land ownership, until the agrarian question can be studied and dealt with as a whole.' The whole agrarian question is full of difficulties, owing partly to the uncertainty of title-deeds, &amp;c., registered under the Turkish regime, and. partly to tho conflicting claims of the tribes on the one hand and the landlords on the other. ' All who have come into touch with this difficulty are agreed that it lies at the bottom of the ultimate pacification of tribal areas.' It is considered essential not to complicate the issue by allowing estates to pass out of the hands of Arab landlords into those of foreign speculators or of the money-owing classes, which consist almost entirely of Jewish and Christian merchants. 8. Personnel .—On the 1st February 1918 (the latest date for which returns have been received) the number of gazetted officers serving under the Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia, or attached to the civil side of the administration of the occupied territories, amounted to something over 100. The table below gives particulars as to the sources from which these officers were drawn ;— Indian Army (including Reserve of Officers). British Army. Indian Civil 1 )e]mrtments.
