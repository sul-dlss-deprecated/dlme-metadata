They rather, instead/shov/ed reluctance to cooperate with the British Consul in rescuing the survivors and those who might have^lock- ed up in the hatches and cabins in a serious condition and who could likely be saved. Had the Muscat Goveriiment co operated wholeheartedly, it is believed, many others would have been rescued and many snix articles could have been prevented from going into the bottom of the sea. Many xztl±Bx articles such as tined provisions, mirrors, soap, utensils, foodstuffs, suits have been stolen from the Dah Pu. I have no doubt that doors, windows and bedsteads have alsd&gt; been stolen and sold in Muscat and Matrah.

Since sinking DAHPU most likely form for aggression to take seems to be bombardment of Muscat by submarine in which case in addition to reassurance to Sultan safety of Cable and Wireless installation and lives and property of British Indian and British subjects have to be considered. Would therefoi*e urge SNOPG be asked to station man-of-war here capable of competing with submarine. ATMOSPHERE not in that category as I understand she has no ASDIC fitting and only light armament. 3. .Please confirm that as reported in my telegram No. C/902 dated 4th July to you I may inform Muscat Government and Sultan that DAHPU sunk by torpedo. Even after doing so submit Sultan can do nothing for Muscat’s defence in present case. Have considered urging black-out but very doubtful of possibility enforcing it and its use especially since ATMOSPHERE anchored here each night with her lights visible. 4. Anti-submarine measures not directly our province but feel necessary to state DAHPU is as reported verbally to me by naval officers third recent sinking.these waters and it is patently obvious equipment so far supplied especially aircraft are largely unserviceable and unsuitable for such measures.

Dear Sir, SV s.s. y Pahpu 1 of 28. 6. 43. ?Ta beg to inform you that since the time we found drums of bitumen, cargo of s. s. , Dahpu*, lying at Kilbu, Doha and }&lt;/feteirah shores we instructed our coolie serang to go around the shores upto iiateirah whenever he finds time and report to us if anything is traced there. On Sunday the 19th. instant, our clerk Aimed and the coolie serving went‘along the shores of Doha and to their surprise they found two iron beams and an anchor lying there. After this they returned back to arrange for coolies and boats to bring the beams and anchor to i^uscat and on their way they observed two big fishing boats of I&amp;oteirah fishermen proceeding towards Mateirah with something heavy tied with trie boats. They questioned the boatmen but could not get satisfactory reply from them and then they came alongside' the s.s. , I3ahpu , and asked the guards on board, who also said that they knov; nothing about anything being removed from the ship. After arranging for coolies and boats for the removal of two beams and the ancnor lying at Doha beach, our clerk and the collie serang proceeded to Mateirah to find out the result of their observation, ana to their great surprise they found an iron beam bigger than the Doha ones lying at i&amp;tteirah beach. All the three beams and the anchor have been removed by us to Luscat Customs. To salve iron beams and spore anchor of the ship requires more than a doaen men on the job and it is not possible for anybody to say that he has found these gear of the ship being washed ashore or from the sea, like the drums of bitumen. ./e shall therefore be greatly obliged if you will kindly „ake necessary steps in the matter. ^ M j/ of ,.b further regret to inform you that the railings of tne ri, 3 ho forepart of tiie ship, near the anchorracing Lua&amp;alla coal depots, have been cut and removed,. It has also been brought to our knowledge that the chief diver of Joha, Moheibeth bin Abdulla, lost his life while diving in the hatch number one of the s.s.'Dahpu* on the _ 19th. instant and the body has not yet been found.Telegram From Q Political Agent, Muscat.

Commander Longmire Chief Salvage Officer who came here mid-August to survey wreck stated that owing removal many fittings by Gray Mackenzie’s local agent also by pilfering salvage had been rendered doubly difficult. i 3. He had been told that salvage operations which were otherwise not worth undertaking were being done for, political reasons. They would now involve some two months work. 4 . I have no knowledge when operations are likely to commence but having successfully persuaded State on two previous occasions against withdrawal of Levy guard posted on wreck since 7th July have now agreed. 5. In any case it has been peculiarly unsuccessful in preventing pilfering and Dahpu is now a mere skeleton of its former self. 6 . Unless strong political reasons exist about which I am not informed and which justify lengthy operations the' time for which can ill be spared by already overworked salvage personnel recommend plan to float and remove front half of wreck be abandoned and ship be blown up or operations be postponed for present. - Political -KX\Slj3 '(3 u^° ' /^S Telegran Q From Political Resident, at Shiraz.

One of the relatives of my late husband, who is at Muscat, - has moved for a pension on my behalf without pre-informing me as to the amount to be claimed and very recently I have come to - - know that a monthly pension of 1c/- (Ten) lias been claimed and the application has therefore been forwarded here for my signature \ which I have duly affixed. Your honour is quite well aware that the timings are very - hard. Tla^struggle for existence is dire and it is almost impossi- -ble to maintain 2 persons in a small sum of fe. 1o/- Ten* I have got a young daughter and consequently itl is a very painful and - cumbrous affair to maintain in such a very small sum. I am a - - young helpless widow. % husband to my and ray daughter’s greatest misfortune, died at a very young age leaving practically nothing for the upkeep of myself and my young daughter* To add to my - - misfortune, he has left a daughter, whom I shall have to get - - married in future, which is quite impossible to be done in a smali 7 sum of !$. 1o/- Ten, which may be given td me monthly by way of - pension. Our caste rules, our family traditions, our position in life estop me from getting myself educated at my present age and hence there is no scope whatsoever for me to eke out anything further - than what is given to me by way of pension.

I, the undersigned young and helpless widow of Prahladra^ Dayashanker, who died at Muscat as a result of sinking of S. 2. f, Dahpu”, most kxfcx humbly and respectfully beg to approach your Honour with a request that my application dated 17th Decembemc, 4j for pension, was submitted to the Political Agent at Bahrein, by - - whom I am advised vide his No. 2972-5/5 dated 30th December, 1943 that the said request has been passed to you at ^luscat for necessaij action and the matter may therefore be referred to you. In this connection I beg to mention that as per our castas rules, a young lady after* being married has solely to depend upon - her husband and his family as there remains no right for her in her five members in the family of my husban? father’s house . There were i. e. myself, my husband, his father, mother and a young daughter - of mine, of which my husband has,to my misfortune, left me in this - young age, while my father-in-law has been very old aged about 64 and as such there was no other source of our maintainance of the - family except my husband, on whom all the members were dependant. I shall have to get my daughter educated and married at the age of * about 15. She is now only 3 years old. Your Honour are * well aware that the times are very kxx hard and the struggle for existence is dire. In the present clrcum- -stances a family has^to spend about 25 /- per month only for - ^ provisions and as there is no such family member, on whom I kx* - - can rely upon for my maintainance on account of the old age of my father-in-law, I with my daughter and the dependants have to pass our life only on your generosity of allowing the sum to me given to me by way of pension. Under the circumstances I most humbly again request - - Your Honour to give serious, sympathetic and generous consideration P . T. 0.2 18th lyGarch, 1944^ consideration to this my appeal and arrange to grant me a maximum sum of pension as per liberal rules of the Government for such - - cases and oblige.
