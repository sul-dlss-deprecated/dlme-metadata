Thinking that it will he of interest to the Government ot India, I have the , , honour to forward extracts from informal X® D ' r7 correspondence which has passed between (2) Mr. Grahame to Major Cox, cUted nth Graliame, Consul of Shiraz, and October 1906. ,r n u a *■ a oflfV! nivsGlf on the subiect of the status of oiWoe 001 t0 Mr - Grah,me, Kais, or Qois Island, in the Persian Gulf (4) Mr. Grahame to Major Cox, dated 19th near November 1906. (5) Mr. Grahame to Major Cox, dated -iyth November 1906. 2 It will be seen that the correspondence arose in connection with the case of the murder of Abu Thabi subjects by inhabitants of Paona, with which the Government of India are familiar. Referring to Mr. Graham^ aUusion to the possibility of some concession by the Kowamis of rights in Qeis to Sheikh Zaeed bin Khalifa, in order to appease the latter m connection with the Taona claim, I cannot at present figure to myself any practical interpre tation of his idea; at the same time it is not impossible that a further examina- tion of the question might elicit indications trending m some feas.ble direction. , The Government of India will no doubt revert to the question should it appear to them to possess any significance.

Mulk, who had only taken Taona over for a period from the Governor of the Gulf Ports on account of its proximity to Qeis ( ) which island has for many years belonged to the Kowami family, has recently handed over Paona to the Deiya licgi.

The Kowamis presumably think they are cleverly shifting all responsibility. Is the Island of Qeis of any good to anyone ? If so would it be possible or politic for us to satisfy the Sheikh of Abu Thabi, receiving in return from the Kowamis some prospective advantage in Qeis ? This vague idea floated into my brain a few days ago, and vague though it be I hasten to submit it to y ou. Dated the 26th October 1906, From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—G, G bahame , Esq , Shiraz. I am sorry to have delayed replying to your note of 11th instant regarding pOBsibility of satisfying Abu Thabi by giving him some rights in Qeis.The island is too far from Abu Thabi's sphere to make the idea practicable I fear. On the other hand, it would be interesting to know whether Qeis is the Kowam's absolute property, and if so, whether he could alienate it. A propos oi quite another question the Mowagar-ed-Dowleh told me the other day that Keis was the Kowam's absolute property and that the Derya Begi had no right to interfere there. Could you verify this and find out the precise nature of the Kowam's tenure ? Dated Bushire, the 19ih November 1906. From—G. G rahame , Esq., Shiraz, To — M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Your letter of 26th October regardinoj the Island of Qeis. I will endeavour to find out how the Kowamis became possessed of the island and what their rights are. I have been led to understand that they purchased it outright from the Persian Government. In the course of a conversation with Nasr-ed-Dowleh (before receipt of your letter under reply) he told me that the island was chiefly valuable on account of its springs of sweet water and of its pearl banks, the yield of which latter is improving. The revenue (stated to be 800 Tomans per year) drawn by the Kowamis from the island is chiefly from dues levied on the pearl fisheries. Dated Bushire, the 29th November 1906. From— G. Grahame , Esq., Shiraz, To—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. In continuation and amendment of the information conveyed to you in my demi-official of 19th instant, regarding the Island of Qeis, when I was calling on Salar-ul-Sultan on 27th instant with Mr. Somers Cocks 8alar-ul-8ultan stated to me that Qeis was granted to his grandfather (Ali Muhammad Khan Kowam-ul-Mulk died 1883) about 28 years ago as a reward for services in the Gulf provinces by the late Nasr-ul-Din Shah. He added that the deed of gift was written entirely or almost entirely ' manu regia ' and is probably a unique document of the kind. I understand that the Kowam's rights over Qeis are absolute. \ G.
