In the course of the year the Residency severed most of its links with the Persian side of the Gulf and is now only concerned with a few establishment matters* No casualties occurred amongst rulers of the Gulf States and nothing has occurred to impair their relations with the Residency. Except for some anti-Jewish disturbances in Bahrain at the beginn ing of December which did not have very serious results, and hosti3 itles between the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dubai on the Trucial Coast, all the States have enjoyed peace and a reasonable measure of prosperity. TheSultan of Muscat remained at Dhofar throughout the year and the administration of the State suffered somewhat through lack of his personal supervision* He is very anxious to obtain a British Adviser to look after affairs at Muscat during hi! prolonged absences* The Iman of Oman who was thought to be dying recovered his heAlth early in the year and little more has been heard of the Sultan's plans for extending his authority over the interior of Oman. Oil The Kuwait Oil Company are increasing their production rapidly and forging ahead with the provision of accommodation for their staff in the face of many difficulties. The large royaltiej which the Shaikh of Kuwait is receiving constitute a serious prob lem as his State is capable of little development and it is diffi cult to determine how the money can best be spent* Endeavours are being made to persuade him to accept a British Financial Adviser. In Bahrain there has been some increase in production and the Bahrain Petroleum Company are now taking a deep bore to ascertain whether there is another stratum of oil below that which they are at present working. In the autumn they made substantia: Increases in the wages of their Indian and Arab employees to meet the Increased cost of living* In Qatar Messrs* Petroleum Develop* ment (Qatar) Limited are proceeding rapidly with the drilling of new wells in the place of those which they were ordered to destroy during the war and are expected to go into production in about two years time* Messrs* Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limlt&lt; are continuing their surveys on the Trucial Coast but no find of oil has yet been announced. No oil operations were carried out in Muscat territory during the year*QlslLAxA&amp;ilm* A new Air Agreement was concluded with the Sultan of Muscat on the 5th April. It gives His Majesty’s Government certain powers of control and allows them the use of all existing landing grounds in Muscat territory. Elsewhere there have been no develop ments of note. In Kuwait, the existing landing ground and facilities are inadequate for the greatly increased air traffic resulting from the Oil Company’s operations, and the construction of a new landing ground is under consideration. The air services have on the whole been adequate for local needs. gsmsrslfel With the assistance of His Majesty’s Government, the Gulf States have been receiving an adequate supply of wheat at a reason able price. Supplies of tea and sugar from India and elsewhere have also been adequate. There is a shortage of rice. Most of the other necessities of life are available in reasonable quantit ies though prices in some cases are high. Since the 15th August, exchange control is being exercised through this Residency except in respect of hard currencies, fixed quotas of which were allotted for the year by the Reserve Bank of India. Trade in Muscat has suffered severely owing to the absence of a bank there and the restrictions placed by the Reserve Bank of India on the operation by Muscat merchants on their accounts in India. The pearl trade ^ has slumped as a result of the ban imposed by the Government of India on the import of pearls into that country, and the export trade in dried dates from Muscat.has also suffered on account of restrictions imposed by that Government on their import to India. * LB* 0 O 0 V3 Dr. I.M.A. Doeg / From To 22.11.1947 31.12.1947 (h) Director of Education Post vacant from To 1.1.1947 31.12.1947 (i) Principal Technical School Mr. Said Tabbara From To 1,1.1947 31,12,1947 n 3 * AL KHAI'IFAH His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad AI Khaiifah, K.G.I,E. / as unchangeable His Highness the Shaikh’s opinions and behaviour are/ as his appearance - an effect achieved by constant and heavy dyeing of his beard. He grows, perhaps, more pompous, more inclined to interfere in the details of his administration and more impatient of restraining influences. But his fundamental trust in the British Government, his reliance upon his Adviser, his anxiety that Bahrain should remain the centre of the Gulf have remained unimpaired during the year, together with his narrowness of vision, his hatred of Qatar, his inability to take a long view and his often fatuous conviction (occasionally for his own purposes merely assumed) that there is a simple answer to every question. His health remained good. His intelligence system has been praised, somewhat ruefully, by members of his own family. His attitude to oil production has remained the same and he continues to hoard the bulk of the proceeds there from in securities whose real value may well fall. His private life is not generally discussed. Other Al Khalifah worthy of mention during the year were: Shaikh Rashid bin Mumainmad, father-in-law of the late ruler who died in August and was (it is said) over 90 years of age; Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Isa, senior uncle of His Highness who visited Kuwait but left, however, no record of having talked politics there; and his son, Shaikh Hamad who, having completed his studies at Beirut University went to Stanford where he hopes to take a degree in a couple of years time. - 4. EDUCATION b No new schools were opened during the year although the existing ones are crowded and boys are refused admission. The foreign element amongst the teachers still occasionally cause trouble and the Egyptian masters in particular have created many uncomfortable situations which has prejudiced the Shaikh against them. The Syrians, on the other hand, are well spoken of. Number of .schools in existence on 1.1.1947 15 Number of Students on 1st January, 1947 3178 Number of Students on 31st December, 1947 3414 5. AGRICULTURE . The Bahrain Government reports no progress during the year ’’owing to the difficulty in obtaining trees, plants and other seeds from India and ’Iraq”. The prices of lucerne, the main fodder crop, and of vegetables remained high. / 6 - MUNICIPALITIES6. I MUNICIPALITIES Badly needed work was begun to metal the main roads in Manama. The Municipalities were able during the year to acquire more vehicles which helped considerably. Four Kesidential houses were completed and let in the Municipal Garden. The garden itself has been greatly improved. &lt; 7. PUBLIC jVORKS The new customs sheds were completed, the buildings being roofed with asbestos sheetings and having cement floors. A new Passport Office and a shed for the inspection of passe-ngers'' luggage were also built at the entrance to the pier. The P.W.D. Office, stores, sheds and Officer-in-Charge, P.W.D’s flat were completed and work was begun on the nine shops in Barrett Road on the site of what was formerly the customs import shed. Material for the new buildings took two years to arrive from the date of ordering. Mr. Stanley Kills was appointed as Officer-in-Charge the P.W.D. Work was started on the installation of the ’Water Supply in November 1947 and 20% of the work had been completed by the end of the year. Supply is expected to be in part operation by July of this year, and if equipment is forthcoming from England it should be complete by the end of October. Operation however is dependent on the requisite supply of electricity. 8 . EL ECTRIC DEPARTMENT Supply remained well in arrear of demand owing to the breakdowns of one generating set in the middle of August, this loss being partially remedied by assistance from the R.A.F. Station; and made up in the winter months so far as actual present consumers are concerned by the installation of a new set. The gap between supply and demand still potentially persists however, and is bound to be realised again next summer particularly when it is remembered that many consumers will be without air- conditioning and even sufficient electric lighting, and that the automatic Telephone and the Water Supply schemes may be held up for lack of current. This is all the direct result of the Bahrain Government’s failure to take its own electrical Engineers’ advice given in 1944 to order then sufficient new generators to meet the estimated (now well realised) demand. T RANSPORT DEPARTMENT During the year the Government Garage carried out the major repair and servicing of all Government vehicles totalling 62 in all. 6 Humber Station wagons were received from the United Kingdom and 3 Dennis five tonners and 2 Austin Tipping trucks were purchased locally during the year. Spare parts for these vehicles were purchased upto the value of Rs. 80,958/- from the United Kingdom. 10. TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT The total number of subscribers at the end of the year was 131 and many additional applications for telephones were refused owing to the commencement of work on the new Automatic system. 11. PEARLING The pearl industry suffered a severe set back owing to the embargo imposed by the Government of India in July 1947. / As a9 / (ii) I'anding, of cargo ’As e result of this, only half the usual number of boats went to the oyster banks. The Bahrain Government advanced money to a number of pearling boat masters to enable them to finance their ventures. .Income from this year’s dive was estimated at 25 lacs of rupees compared with 40 lacs last year. Mr. Harvey C. Wyant, an American Peiarl dealer, established in Bombay, visited Bahrain in the middle of the year to investigate the possibility of establishing an office and to buy pearls here because of the ban on import of pearls into India. He returned in November and bought pearls. 12, CUSTOMS Customs revenue from all sources amounted to Bs. 36,40,575/”,an increase of Rs. 7,57,165/- over the previous year. The reasons for this increase were the removal of controls in the United Kingdom and the U.3.A., general revival in trade and extended operations by Petroleum Concessions Limited, Qatar. A certain amount of the increase is due to higher prices. The total number of Bahrain boats registered by the Customs Department is 1075 of which 903 are sailing boats, 13. FOOD CONTROL Food supplies were no better than last year and the State devoted a considerable amount of time, energy and money towards the yea? providing the necessities of life for the genera}, public. During the year Rs. 113 lacs was spent pn the purchase of Rice, Tea, Sugar, Wheat and mixed Persian grains. The monthly cereal ration was successfully maintained and the increased rice ration proved very popular. Flour was issued to the villages only, as unlike the towns, they have no'facilities for grinding wheat. The price of sugar rose considerably during the last three months of the year due to delays in obtaining quota sugar and the necessity of obtaining such supplies elsewhere in the open market. With a satisfactory harvest in Persia, a steady and continuous supply of livestock, potatoes, onions, fresh and dried fruit were imported into Bahrain, The system of cloth rationing was smoothly run throughout the year. There was an equal distribution of cloth to the villages and town areas. De-control of many more commodities was introduced during the year. Articles kept under control were those supplied under a quota system and for which special exchange was granted through the Agency, Black Market trade was less than last year, due to the availability of more goods ahd resulting competitive spirit among the importers. Prices generally showed no sign of falling. 14. SHIPPING (i) The following is a statement of ships that called during the year 1947:- British 322 Danish 8 American 179 Italian 7 Norwegian 74 Spanish 18 Dutch 31 Finnish 1 1 Panamerican 63 Palestinian 1 Swedish 18 Portuguese 1 Total =723. The total imports for the year amounted to 71,402 tons and exports to 91,076 tons. ^' ~ ^ attended Z ty - 6 - 14. (ii) Landin^ of Cargo, There were a number of complaints made by merchants against the landing arrangements at Sitra (the oil port) and at Manama (the Bahrain general port) which are practically speaking a monopoly of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co. Ltd. A meeting was held on the 8 th of April presided by eh by the Kuler of Bahrain and/about thirty prominent merchants. Proposals were put forward but nothing concrete was dedided at this meeting. In May a second meeting was held by the Bahrain Merchant community to consider a proposal to form their own landing company. A sum of Rs. 7,00,000 was promised to finance it. A third meeting was held on the ?9th May at the Agency, The Political Agent, His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Abdulla bin ’Isa, uncle of ■ is Highness, Mr. C.D. Belgrave, the Adviser, and representatives of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Co Ltd., were present. At this meeting it soon became apparent that the merchants wished not to' compete but to co-operate with Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and the general impression was that the proposed landing company was un likely to materialize. On the 1st of June a. fourth meeting was held. It was stated that the merchants would withdraw their application to the Bahrain Government provided Messrs. Gray Mackenzie accepted certain terms regarding delivery and care of cargo which should be discharged at Manama, a 20 % reduction in the existing scale of landing charges, and that the Bahrain Government would review the scale of landing charges yearly.. Mr. Meikle of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie agreed to most of the terms, but said that the question of discharging cargo at Manama would have to be taken up with the shipowners before he could give an outright decision. He stated that the company could not agree to the proposed reduction of 20 °/o . After some discussion a reduction of 15 % was agreed to on cargo landed ex vessels anchored at Manama . The merchants then announced their withdrawal of their application, but requested that they be allowed to meet once a month to discuss any grievances et cetera. This was agreed to by the Gray Mackenzie Representative, present at the meeting. No further complaints have been made. 15.

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE (i) Agency Courts . • Civil and criminal suits entertained during the year totalled 1,694 and 334 respectively, as compared, with 1,666 and 412 last year. A separate report has been sent to the Political Resident. (ii) Local Courts . There were fewer criminal cases than last year. A number of Arabs were tried and convicted of drunkenness and of being in the possession of alcohol. 17. POLICE Strength on 1.1.

Three sergeants from the British Detachment resigned at the expiry of their contract and returned to England. There were 414 theft cases reported to the Police‘as against 411 last year. 130 traffic accidents occuned in which 5 persons lost their lives. % *1 One case of murder occurred in which an Iraqi stabbed his cousin. 18. - ECONOMIC (i) Trad e t As previously noted, the island had an active year in trade 5 as delivery of consumer goods became easier, which cannot be said of heavy .products like machinery; in many cases exchange difficulties - made these unavailable from the United States of America and the United Kingdom was unable to supply them: Trade with continental countries increased. Exchange and import controls were relaxed in May so far as soft currency coujatries were concerned but were re-imposed in December. Our lack of consistency in their administration has puzzled the locals. (ii) Exchange and currency Exchange rates did not change during the year. Indian funds from bazaar sources were not plentiful because of the ban on pearl sales to India. Later when overseas accounts in India became 'uon resident' local supplies of Indian funds practically ceased. \ The foreign exchange allocation given to Bahrain in the early part of the year still exists in limited amounts for currencies other than dollars. The dollar quota was soon used up and applications were only accepted for special essential . goods which were recommended through the Agency to the exchange control authorities. There was a surplus of money during the year in various parts of the Gulf.^ The amounts were so large that the ^ coinsbanks suspended accepting/until arrangements were made to ship the surplus the India. Towards the-end of the year an influx of hundred-rupee notes took place. (iii) Industry Other than the oil and pearling inudstries there are none of importance in Bahrain. 19. MEDICAL (i) General The health of the community was good during the year. There were no major epidemics. Anti-malarial measures were carried out by the Bahrain Government and the incidence of malaria has been reduced substantially. Figures show a 7.7 % incidence of all dieseses seen, which, with 1946, is the lowest recorded and compares favourably with the 22 % incidence figure of the years before anti-malarial '' / measures9 * ► '' 'v v' • ./ - \ measures and measures against intestinal diseases were instituted by the Bahrain Government, ,J -here ?yrere no cases of major infectious diseases in Bahrain during the year.

Fifteen passengers and the crew of a dhow from Dubai which ^-arrived at Bahrain during the period of Cholera restrictions against Dubai and Sharjah were kept under observation at the station from the 6 th to the 13th November, 1947. Quarantine restrictions Passengers by air from Egypt and by land and air from India landing at Bahrain were only permitted to land provided they^were in possession of valid anti-cholera inoculation certificates. These restrictions continued throughout the year. ' ^ The outbreak of Cholera in the Middle East in the autumn necessitated rigid precautions which prevented the disease from entering the island. In Saudi Arabia the Government imposed a ban on travellers^entering their ports. Three cases of suspected cholera occurreo Dubai a.nd the Residency Surgeon accompanied by the R.A.F. Medical Officer visited the Trucial Coast and investigated the reported outbreak. They found no evidence of cholera but as a precautionary measure declared Dubai to be infected. Restrictions were imposed and supplies of cholera vaccine were sent to Dubai and Sharjah to inoculate the inhabitants of the place., No further cases were reported, 20. T EE BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COMPANY (a) Staff Mr. R.M. Brown was the Chief Local Representative throughout the year. I n March Mr. J.O.Fifer was appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company to be Assistant General Manager. (b) Productio n The total oil production during the year was 9,410,7iO net barrels., an average of 25,783 net barrels per day. The rate of oil production was appreciably higher than in anv previous years as a result of additional wells and gas injection which maintained a low rate of extraneous water invasion of the reservoir, (c) Development In 1947 Six new wells were completed. A deep test well was started during the year to test the formations' below the present depth of the field and to investigate the possibility of developing commercial production of oil or gas. 1(d) Imports of Arabian Americsn Crude Oil The capacity of the (A - B) submarine pipe line has been increased by the looping of the present line on the land portion on the Bahrain side and^other alterations and additions on the Arabian side. The total import of Arabian American Crude oil into Bahrain during the year totalled 36,053,308 net barrels and an additional 480,292 net barrels of cr.ude received by tankers through Sitra Marine terminal. A total of 36,633,600 net barrels was received in the Refinery. (e) Exploration dork Drilling in the Additional Area has continued and structure holes to develop geological information within the Additional Area were completed. Six of these holes were drilled in the Hawar Island and two in the Fasht A1 Jarim area. The information gathered from this work was reviewed and a plan formulated to continue the work In 1948. (f) Refinery operations Refining operations were at a high rate throughout the year and crude runs during the year totalled 46,879,431 barrels as compared to 33,989,452 barrels last year. Shipment of products during the year were as follovjs:- Aviation Gasoline Gasoline Kerosene Diesel Oil Fuel Oil 90,832 barrels 10,625,235 ' 5,632,458 ” 7,293,699 ' 18,866,848 ' 42,509,072 barrels Shipment of Aviation Gasoline represents 48,709 barrels of Bahrain stock and 48,123 barrels imported from the U.3.A. during the year. In addition to the above shipment the company shipped 43,490 tons of coke produced in previous year’s operations. The foregoing through-put represented approximately a 35,3 increase over 1946 operations and was accomplished by the alterations made to the existing equipment and operation on an exceedingly tight shipping programme pending the completion of adequate shipping tankage at Sitra. (g) Refinery A few major facilities were completed during the year which consisted of (a) a vacuum unit for preparation of refined residuums for Asphalt manufacture, (b) a convertor unit for preparing Air blown Asphalt and (c) a 12” pipe was looped off the Bahrain portion of the Arabian - Bahrain Crude Line, Other minor alterations were also completed on several existing plants which were under construction in the previous year. '/ Sitra fr. oitra Terminal(h) Sitra and Sitra Terminal The erection of thirteen new tanks and appurtenances was the only major construction started during the year. ‘There were a few minor additions made to the wharves and causeway pier-head which included an installation of machin ery for manufacture of Asphalt drums and installation of a new IB” fuel shipping line to the new wharf. V \ ' (i) Drum Plant No major alterations were made to the Drum Plant; minor additions were carried out. (j) Gamp facilities Additional employees necessitated increased ■ facilities in Awali, 'Thirteen two-bedroom detached houses have been completed. Eight of the sixteen 1947 type duplex houses are also.complete, others are nearing completion. Construction has also started of 20 prefabricated two bedroom detached houses.

In Has al Khaimah they v/ere obstructed by tribes feudatory to the Shaikh &amp; as al Khaimah, until the Shaikh made certain payments to them from the money he was receiving from the Petroleum Concessions Limited. * ' ' . A reconnaissance was made to Buraimi by the Abu ^habi route and also via Ramlat Anaij. The survey was continued in October when a line was run from Maqta (fort at Abu Dhabi) to Buraimi via Bedah al Ajam and returning by the southern track via Bedah Hammameh. Jabal Hafit was surveyed, about two thirds of the mountain bfeing examined, and a line was also run from the north tip eastwards to the main Oman range.13 The main survey was concentrated on the area from Maqta westwards for approximately 100 miles and covering the terrain inland to a depth of 50 kilometres. A further line was run from Jabal Ali east wards to the main mountain range. The following gives a summary of personnel einployed by Petroleum Concessions Limited on the Trucial Coast.

The figures exclude traffic in transit for ’ Iraq and Iran. Figures for aeronautical traffic have been included and the decline shown in the latter part of the year is due to part of the traffic temporarily being diverted through the International Aeradio Limited, Muharraq. the Company have been unable to provide full services because of the inadequate poifer supply efrom the State.

From November Saudi Arabia traffic has been forwarded through Saudi Government Station at A1 Khobar. The Radio Telephone service to Dukhan, Qatar, was changed to Radio Telegraphy. (iii) Cables The Gulf cables were interrupted for long periods, including total interruptions. The only, cable restored was the Bushire - Muscat cable by H.M.S. 'Bull-finch”, Communications were, however, maintained by alternative wireless channels to Aden and London direct. In November a temporary wireless circuit was operated with the Karachi radio to assist the Pakistan Government. It was discontinued when the Muscat - Karachi cable was restored after a period of two years. It is believed that it&amp; interruption was due to the earthquake off the Mekran coast, $v) Technical the installation of a second 10 K..V, telegraphy/ telephone was'completed. Difficulty was experienced in maintaining communication free from interruption because of the breakdown of the local electricity supply, ^here were eight cases of repairs to. ship wireless installation during the year. (v) Staff The development of communications at Bahrain which include Radio/Telephone circuits and Automatic Telephones has resulted in an increase of Staff.' The Cable Office has been extended to house the R/T terminal, and other building, projects for housing of R/T Staff are under construction. (vi) Concession Rights On the 28th of July Cable and Wireless Limited obtained from the Shaikh a concession to operate telephone / communication and public telephone services in his dominions for a period of 20 years. This really regularised a position as monopolists which this long-established concern has held. 23. BRITISH OV .;.dBEl.5 aIRNAYS CORPORATION (i) Towards the beginning of the year the *C* Class flying-boat services were withdrawn from the Cairo - Bahrain - Karachi runs. No service replaced them and the only service which passes through Bahrain was the United Kingdom - Singapore service. There was bitter disappointment' among the public - as it was practically impossible to obtain passages on these through services. ^ About this time the B.O.A, C. agreed to operate a 'Plymouth” weekly flying-boat service between UK - Bahrain with a shuttle service to Karachi. Negotiations were completed in about May and the service was introduced shortly afterwards. The Karachi - Bahrain service was found to be unprofitable to the Corporation and was discontinued towards the latter part of the year. The Bahrain - UK service still continues. (ii) Accidents to B.C.A.C. aircraft On the 23rd of August in the early hours of the morning a B.O.A.C. flying-boat crashed into the sea while alighting.at the Bahrain airport. / Seven0 1 ^ 16 Seven passengers and three crew were killed.

He was relieved by Captain L.E. Porter, R.N,, in November. An agreement was signed between the Royal Navy and the Bahrain Government which provided that the Distilling P}.ant at Jufair should be operated by the Bahrain Government, as the Royal Navy could not provide the personnel for the plant. The ships in the squadron remained H.M.S. 'Wild Goose' and H.M.S. 'WREN'. H.M.S. 'Loch Quoich' and H.M.S. 'Loch Glendhu' also visited Bahrain. The Royal Navy .survey ship H.M.S. 'Challenger' visited Bahrain and worked off Qatar during the year under review. On the 25th February Vice Admiral Sir Arthur Palliser, K.C.B., D.S.C., Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, accompanied by Lady Palliser and Captain R.J.R.

The Royal Air Force establishments at Bahrain and Sharjah have been greatly reduced. Civil aircraft using Muharraq are now handled and services by the British Overseas Airways Corporation, There are no night landing facilities apart from those necessary for emergency landings only. / LateLate in the year the Air Ministry planned that the British Overseas Airways Corporation and the International Air Radio Corporation - a company formed hy three British Airways Corporations, should take over the maintenance of the aerodrome hy providing civil control and Airadio Staff, It is evident that the plan has been approved as'the B.O.A.C, and the International Air Radio Corporation seem to be maintaining the aerodrome. Civil aircraft are continually calling at Bahrain. 26.

Both the Admirals, their staff, the Captain and the officers of the Toledo attended a cocktail party at the Agency on the evening of the 12 th. The ’Toledo’ left for Ras Tanura on the 13th. This occasion was notable since, so far as is known, it was the first on which an American warship visited the Gulf; no such display of American naval power has ever been seen in these waters.

(i) In February, the Bahrain Government were much disturbed about the activities of certain darwishes who came to Bahrain from Oman and set themselves up as a religious leaders. They traded on the sale of amulets ' andi charms and persuaded some of the younger members of # their following to submit,to the Zikr exercises practised by the darwishes of North Africa, In these exercises-nails and pins are driven into the body of the devotees when they have been worked into a certain state of hysterical insensibility and they appear to feel no pain at the time, but injuries are often inflicted. One devotee was taken to the Government Hospital for treatment. These darwishes were arrested by the Bahrain Government and later on deported from the Island. i (ii) The Bahrain Spring Race meeting was held on the 11th April and those present were His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain, the wife of the Hcn’ble the Political Resident, the Political Agent, and Miss Hay. There was a card of six events. (iii) On the loth August, Independence Day was celebrated separately by the nationals of India and Pakistan in Bahrain in the premises of the Bahrain Sports Club and the Bahrain Cricket Club respectively. The Hon’ble the Political Resident and the .Political Agent, Bahrain attended both these functions, at which ^ His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad A1 Khalifah was present, (iv) On the 3rd October, the Arabs of Manamah observed as Palestine Day and most of the Arab shops in the town were closed in protest against the report of the Special Committee of the U.N.O. which recommended the partition of Palestine. Speeches were made by leading Arabs and one of the Egyptian teachers, to a large audience assembled for the Friday prayers. Later in the day a committee of representatives of all the Arab Clubs in Bahrain met and resolved to raise a fund in aid of the Arabs of Palestine (v) The Bahrain Government made an attempt to control the spread of veneral disease and engaged two Indian doctors to carry out the registration of prostitutes and regular inspection of brothels / (vi) AxV 1 1 « 20 **» The temperatures for the year were as follows;- Maximum Temperature Minimum Temperature Maximum.Humid 1 ty Minimum Humidity Total Rainfall in the year = 2.65 n 10S e F, on 18.6,1947 49°F. on 27.12.1947 98fi on 6,5.1947 26% on 1,1.1947 = 2.65' 32. A R A from Bahrain (i) His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim A1 Than!, the Ruler of Qatar, has continued to suffer in his health throughout the year. He had one severe attack of gastroenter-’ itis^ and was given appropriate treatment by the medical officer of the Petroleum Concession Limited at Dukhan. In Novembers the year his health was again very low. He has shown unwillingness to abide by the regime prescribed by his medical adviser, (ii) In October, Dr, Storm of the American Mission Hospital) Bahrain visited Qatar and advised the Ruler as to the type of Hospital he should have and the equipment that should be^ •installed in it.. Later in the year Rs. 5,000/- worth of equipment was bought for the hospital. The Ruler paid in full for this. A 20 bed hospital \was completed and the conditions on which the American Mission were to run it are (a) that the Ruler pays Rs, 1,000/- per month for Staff, including one Indian Doctor and Nurses (b) an American Doctor should be present for one month in the year at the hospital and (c) the Ruler and his family should be treated free of charge, 33. TRUCIAL COAST (i) Personnel . The Residency Agent, Mr. Jasim bin*Mohammad al Kadhmawi, was in charge of Trucial Coast affairs from the 1st to the 9th January when Mr, G.N. Jackson, M.B.E,, arrived in Sharjah and assumed charge as Political Officer, Trucial Coast. On the 29th November Mr, G.N. Jackson, returned to Sharjah/and remained until the end of the year, (ii) T rucial Coast Shaikhs The following were the Ruling Shaikhs of the various States on the Trucial Coast throughout the year:- 1. Dubai 1 2, Sharjah 3. Abu Dhabi . 4, Ajman 5. Ras al Khaimah 6 , ‘Kalba (iii) Royal Navy . Shaikh Said bin Maktum, O.E.B. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr al Qasimi Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid Shaikh Rashid bin Humaid Shaikh Sultan bin Salim Shaikh Hamad bin Sa'id (minor) Regent; Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad During the year under review H.M.S.’H/REN', H.M.S. 'WILDG00SE” and H.M.S. 'LOCH GLENDHU' called at Sharjah. (iv) Royal Air Force . On the 14th January the ’Iraqi Arab Levies were withdrawn from Sharjah. The strength of the R.A.F. in Sharjah has been considerably reduced. At the end of the year the number of / R.A.F. • • • •21 R.A.F. personnel was 46, The R.A.F. Medical Officer has also 'been withdrawn. During the year surplus R.A.F. vehicles and stores * were sold by British Stores Disposals Officers, who came down to Sharjah for the purpose, (v) B ritish Interests . (a) Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited. During the early part of the year Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. completed geophysical surve 37 - of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah territories. The geophysical party met with constant interference from many tribes inhabiting these Shaikhdoms and the Political Officer and the Residency Agent were continually and actively exercised • in promoting settlements between the tribes and their ruling Shaikhs, without which the company could not have proceeded with their work. Most of the interference arose from the Jawasim Shaikhs’ parsimony towards and lack of influence oyer the tribes inhabiting the territories for which they had given oil concessions. A geophysical survey of ^bu tfhabi was then begun and continued until the end of March when operations were concluded for the season. The survey party left the Trucial Coast on the 1st April. On the 11th October they returned to Sharjah for the 1947 - 48 cool seasons operations. Geophysical and topographical surveys were started simultaneously in Abu Dhabi territory and that part of Buraimi which is under Abu Dhabi. Work in the latter area had been completed by the end of the year. The Company’s local representative did not succeed in obtaining permission from the chiefs of the Nai’m and al-Bushmis tribes to do geophysical work in their territories. They put forward such unreasonable demands that his principals decided to drop the matter for the time being. Work during the latter part of the year proceeded without any opposition or interference by recalcitrant tribesmen or common robbers. The Shaikh of Abu Dhabi’s security for oil company personnel has been complete; and the party’s main problem has been one of transport. ^During thfe year under review Mr, H.M. Jackson continued to represent Messrs. Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited/ He visited most of the Trucial Coast towns and also Buraimi. (b) Civil Aviation . On the 10th i January the last ’’C” Class Flying boat to fly on this route left Dubai. Since then B.0.A^.C. 'have not used their bases in Dubai and Sharjah except as emergency landing areas. Wireless and meteorological services have been maintained, and also catering services on a reduced scale. International Air ^adio took over the wireless installations towards the end of the year. A number of casual operators and through services used B.O.ii.C’s facilities; but, for passenger and freight space and for the carriage of mails, local residents have had to rely on the R.A.F. routine services to their station at Sharjah. The following ara particulars of aircraft which passed through Sharjah during the year 1947. B.O.A.C. 18 Eastbound &amp; 'Westbound K.L.M. 61 ” &amp; »* Other 113 ” &amp; ' aircraft (handled by B.O.A.C) Following the ban imposed by the Government of India on the landing of Dutch aircraft in India, K.L.M. aircraft useo Sharjah as a staging post on the Batavia-Amsterdam route / fromfrom August to October, 1947. During the period under report 24 ships called at Sharjah and 32 ships at Dubai. (d) The Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company . Mining for red oxide on Abu Musa Island vms continued until the 9th May when Mr, E. Innes Pocock, of the Golden Valley Ochre &amp; Oxide Company, Limited, returned' to the United Kingdom, 1,000 tons of red oxide from Abu Musa and about 70 tons from Sir Abu Na'Air Island were shipped to England by S,S. Beharistan. On the 23rd September Mr. Inhes Pocock returned to Abu Musa and recommenced operations on the Island early in October. Ee was still working there at the end of the year. His operations were hampered towards the end of the year Ly the Shaikh of Sharjah’s taxing the labourers working in the mines and attempting to secure the dismissal of those subjects of other Shaikhs from whom he was unable to extort a large portion of their earnings. (e) Imperial Bank of Ira n At . the beginning of the year the Imperial Bank of Iran, which had only recently been opened in Dubai, was to a large extent on probation to the commerical community, The greatest call was on their service as exchange dealers and some caution was at first shown by merchants in depositing funds with them. The advantages of having a bank account are now more widely recognised and the use of the cheque as a means of exchange has greatly increased. The bank’S' principal dealings in exchange were with India, with their other Persian Gulf branches, and with Basra, where the Trucial Coast wheat quote was purchased. A slight but welcome, increase has been perceptible in trade with the United Kingdom and the se*e Sterling Area. The bank are fostering this as far as possible - the main difficulties being the relatively small market for British goods (largely owing to the state of depression now prevalent) and the inability of most of the merchants to correspond in English. The bank are endeavouring to develop the merchants' contacts with United Kingdom firms and think they will be able to give useful service in this field. -The demand for other facilities normally associated with a bank - such 'as safe deposit facilities and the issue of travellers cheques - has been very slight, (f) Order-In-Council . On the 26th April, 1947, the Trucial States Order-in-Council, 1946, was brought into force on the Trucial Coast. By the Order-in-Council His Majesty's Government assumed jurisdiction over all persons in the Trucial States other than subjects of the Trucial Shaikhs. Since the Order was brought into force some progress has been made in acquainting foreigners with our judicial administration and in establishing joint courts, although not all foreigners who have complaints against subjects of the Shaikhs yet bring their complaints to the Agency in the first instance. Certain of the Shaikhs refer joint cases to the Agency immediately they are received; others are being asked to do so. Meanwhile, foreigners whose cases are first decided by the Shaikhs tend to bring them to the Agency if they get no satisfaction from them. / (vi) Officers' Tours..- 23 - (vi) Officers 1 Tours . On the 29th January the Hon 1 hie Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, accompanied hy Lady and Miss Hay, and Lt-Col A.G. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Abu Dhabi by L.V. Nearchus. Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, accompanied by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, and the Residency Agent, went on board and met the Political Resident, The Political Resident and his family returned the call on the Shaikh at his Fort and took lunch with %h him. On the 22 nd the Political Resident and the Shaikh of ^harjah exchanged calls. The Ruler of Ajinan came to the Agency in the afternoon and called on the Political Resident, who proceeded to Ajman by car shortly afterwards and returned the Shaikh 1 s call. On the 23rd the Political! Resident left for Dubai by L.V, Nearchus. The Shaikh of Dubai called on the Political Resident on board and the Political Resident returned the call at the Shsikh’s palace. In the evening L.V. Nearchus left Dubai and reached Ras al Khaimah on the morning of the 24th. The Political Resident exchanged calls with the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and had lunch with him. On the 26th he continued his journey by road to Umm al Qaiwain, arriving there at noon. After lunching with the Shaikh, the Political Resident and his party returned to Sharjah and left for Balirain on the Nearchus the same day. Throughout the tour Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway took the opportunity to discuss outstanding cases with the Political Officer and had a number of conferences with the Shaikhs concerned. On the 15th April Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, arrived at Sharjah. He visited ^viba.i in the .morning of the 16th and in the afternoon called on the Shaikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain. On the 17th he visited Ras al Khaimah. On the 18th he called on Shaikh Sai’d bin Maktum, O.B.S., Ruler of Dubai, on his launch which was anchored in the Ras al Khaimah creek. He left Ras al Khaimah in the afternoon of the 18th, sheltered from a storm in Umm al Qaiwain creek and reached Dubai on the' 20th. He left for Bahrain on the 21 st. On the 6 th and 7th November Dr. M.A. Steele, M.B.E., Residency Surgeon, Bahrain, visited Sharjah and Dubai in connec tion with a suspected outbreak of cholera. On the 15th December H.M.S. 1 ’AREN 11 with the Political Resident on board arrived at Abu Musa Lsland and left after an hour and a half. The Political Resident was unable to get ashore or to meet the British residents there. (vii) Medical . During the year under review Mal%ria was the chief disease on the Trucial Coast and accounted for one fifth of the new cases treated by the Medical Officer. The following were the most common diseases on the Trucial Coast:- Eye diseases. Venereal diseases Teeth and gum diseases Digestive System diseases Ulcerative and inflammatory diseases. In November a suspected case of cholera was reported in Dubai. Every possible precautionary measure was taken, including inoculation of the public both in Dubai and Sharjah. About one fourth of the population of both towns was / inoculated • * • *24 - inoculated. No further case occurred and it is presumed that the suspected case was not, in fact, cholera. The quarantine restrictions caused very considerable dislocation and adversely affected trade for some weeks afterwards. (viii) Postal Services . During the year a Sub-Post Office was opened in Sharjah for two days a week as an experiment. The amount of postal business transacted did not justify its continuation. Air mail services were interrupted when B.O.A.C’s 'C” Class flying boats ceased to call at Dubai. Arrangements were later made to fly mails to Bahrain in R.A.F, aircraft. On the 29th October Mr, W. Appleby of the British General Post Office accompanied by Khan Sahib Abdul Hamid, Superintendent, Civil Engineering, Post Office, Hyderabad, visited Dubai to study the problems involved in the transfer of the Dubai Post Office from the Government of Pakistan to K.i .G. (ix) Dubai - Abu Dhabi dispute , The armed conflict between Abu Dhabi and Dubai which arose last year over the ownership of Khor Ghanadha was being actively prosecuted by Abu Dhabi at the beginning of the year. Shaikh Jumah bin T aktum, brother of the Ruler of Dubai, who had been one of the main obstacles to a settlement last year was ordered by the Political Resident to reside in Bahrain until further notice, and economic sanctions were enforced, against Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi. these measures resulted in the settlement of the dispute on the 6 th March. The cessation of hostilities was agreed,with jubilation by subjects of both Shaikhs. On the 8 th May Shaikh Shakhbut'came to Sharjah and met Shaikh Sai’d bin Maktum, O.B.E., Ruler of Dubai, at the Agency. Unfortunately the settlement proved to be only temporary, for shortly afterwards Shaikh Shakhbut failed to fulfil his undertaking to bring his allies into the settlement: and, although he was repeatedly called upon by the Political Agent to act in accordance with the peace treaty which he had signed, he declared that he was unable to do so and alleged that he exercised no control over his former allies. The chief of these, the Manasir, then restarted their depredations against Dubai. Economic sanctions ws?e were re-imposed against Abu Dhabi and continued up to the end of the year. After forbearing to retaliate for the first raid, in November the Shaikh of Dubai sent a pursuit party after a large force of Manasir that raided his territory a second time, x hey overtook the raiders at Soat, north of Liw'a, and inflicted very heavy- casualties on theip. Indeed, the casualties of 56 killed and 20 v/ounded on the Manasir side - including the leader of the Manasir force wounded - and 5 fatal casualties among the Dubai force are said to be the heaviest suffered in a tribal fight on the Trucial Coast within living memory: and many think that the- power of those sections of the Manasir that are allied to Abu Dhabi has been seriously curtailed if not broken for some time to come. (x) Jawasim . The Jawasim Shaikhs of ^harjah and Has al Khaimah together with their cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba, prove, as we gain experience of them, more and more conclusively their impotence and incapacity to rule. Neither the Shaikh of Sharjah nor the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah was able to facilitate the work of the oil company in his Shaikhdom without the Intervention of the Political Officer, while the Shaikhs of Hira and of the Beni Qitab openly defied Sharjah and were only brought to terms by the payment of allowances of Rs.5,000/- and Rs. 30,000/- a year respectively. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has been at loggerheads with his hephews, and the dispute was not settled until he satisfied them financially. I -j 1/ This • • « • 25 J-he affairs in Kalba under the regency of ^haikh Khalid and the de facto control of his nephew Humaid bin Abdullah haye gone from bad to worse. The administration of justice and ''the maintenance of security have been entirely neglected, and such power as Humaid commands has been devoted to the extortion of excessive taxes and forced loans from the subjects of the State. In fact, none of the Jawasim Shaikhs has used what force or influence he commands to oppose the stfong in protection of the wesk. They prefer to befriend law-breakers of whom they are frightened and to use such power they have to extort money and goods from the poor and humble of their subjects, who most need their protection and sucour. Indeed, their subjects £0 in as much fear of depredations by their Shaikhs as by robbers, ibis practise has not been without effect, Persian merchants hitherto established in Sharjah and Has al Khaimah are moving away to Dubai, and villages on the extremities of their domains are turning to the Shaikh of Fujairah for protection. They are now paying their taxes to him because they have found that he gives them some return for then in security. In Dubai, too, the emphasis has been on the Kuler’s duty towards his subjects rather than on his claims to their property. Security there and in Abu Dhabi has been almost complete and both Hulers are obeyed and greatly respected by their subjects. The Shaikh of Dubai and also the Shaikh of Fujairah ( who is most active and whose influence is steadily increasing) have themselves undertaken the punishment of robbers who loot their subjects within Jawasim limits because they know that they can get no satisfaction from the Jawasim Shaikhs, The same is true of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain; and^Ajman has recently assumed, at the.request of the inhabitants, jurisdiction over Masfut, formerly under Shaikh Saqr bin Sultan of the Nai’m, because the latter was unable to protect the inhabitants from the Beni Ka’ab, (xi) Slavery . During the year under review there have been some cases of abduction of persons into slavery from Sharjah, Dubai and other parts of the Trucial Coast and the Batinah. Persons abducted were taken to Hamasah, Buraimi, by land and sold to Saudi and Qatar slave dealers, who ttook most of them to Saudi Arabia on camels. Strong representations have been made to the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah, and the Shaikh of Dubai has expelled from Dubai one Khalifah bin Majid, a notorious slave- dealer, and has recovered three persons who were abducted from Dubai. Most of the bedouin involved in the abduction from Sharjah were of the Beni Qitab, against whom the Shaikh of Sharjah dare not take any action. The Residency Agent visited Buraimi during the year, ma,de enquiries in Hamas ah about the slave trade, and did all he could to supress it. He also arranged for thr-ee abducted women to be retained in Hamasah until they could be recovered through the Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah, from whose territories they had been abducted. (xii) Piracy . ) There has been no complaint against any of the subjects of the Trucial Sheikhdoms of their having engaged in piracy during the year. (xiii) :conom ic. Trade has been depressed throughout the year. Exports to Persia have considerably decreased: and many merchants who held large amounts in Persian currency have lost nearly half their capital - the exchange rate between the toman and the rupee having fallen from par to Bs. 60/- to Ts. 100/-. x he depression has been accentuated by the ban on the import P e . s : r ' 3 - s in t° India and by the curtailment of expenditure by H.M.G’s clefence services.26 This curtailment has not yet been’made good by the activities of the oil company. There is much unemployment^and many subjects of the Trucial Shaikhs have, gone to latar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait in search of work. (±iv) Communications . I The motor track between Dubai and. Muscat through the Wadi el Qaur has been much more frequently^used since local taxi owners were able to buy surplus military vehicles from the R.A.F, Security on'the road between Dubai and the eastern end of Wadi el Qaur, most of which lies in Jawasim territory, has been bad.’ A number of armed robberies have taken place.

Until the spring the American Mission doctors visited him twice each week ana thereafter once a v/eek« On the Slat May His Highness left by air for Riyadh, on a visit to King Ibn Saud returning on the 21st Juie also by, air» His Highness stood the air journey well but the change of routine involved in timing his movements to synchronise with those oi xbn Saud caused a slight rise in his blood pressure for which he was treated by Dr. Storm* On the 26th August His Highness left by sea on a visii to Karachi and Bombay. v/hiTe in Karachi -the i akistan G-overnmen provided him with accommodation, transport, and escorts. I 1 ® met Mr. Jinnah and many other personalities and left Karachi by se, for Bombay on September 15th returning to Kuwait on the 14th October. Largely owing to lack of rain the hawking has been poor and His Highness did not spend so long as usual m the desert during the winter. (b) Shaikh Abdullah as Salim, C.I.E., continued to administer the Finance and the Supply Departments throughout the year except during his visit to Karachi and Bombay in November and December. Shaikh Abdullah appeared more favourably,impressed with the standard of administration in India than tnat m Pakistan. Shaikh Abdullah as Salim's visits to Failecha Island were as frequent as in other years. (c) Shaikh Abdullah al Mubarak,,C.I.E. continued to supervise the Department of Public Security with ruthlessness and energy, maintaining a high degree of security m the town and desert. He visited Iraq in April for a few days and Iraq and Syria in July and August. (d) Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir, C.I.E. performed,his ; duties as Chief Justice and Director of Education efficiently and loyally and remained in Kuwait throughout the year.□MS &amp; J 9 ► V O (e) Shaikh Abdulla al Ahmed remained in charge of the Arsenal. On the 29th June he was married to the daughter of Shaikh oalraan al Haraood as Subah* (f) Shaikh Subah as Salim continued to be 0hief of Police. (g) Shaikh Mubarak al Hamad al Mubarak remained Chief of the Port°of Kuwait. (h) Shaikh Mohammed al Ahmed continued to reside in Basra and ts look after His Highness’ properties in Iraq. (i) Shaikh Fahad as Salim continued a member of the Advisory Councils He was absent from Kuwait in the Levant and ^raq for aoout 7 months* in. Pm.mcAT, .irCHT'S RELATIONS WI TH THSi SikIBi- The Political Agent's relations with the Shaikh have remained most cordial and His Highness has been as ready to co-operate as ever. It is a pity that the litigation over his date-gardens at tao - which constitute the only fly in the ointment - cannot be set ^led. I?. local intsrksts . (a) as a result of continued pressure the Municipality,and Departments of Revenue.and Education ann. Health produced their accounts for the year. The Supply department, however,.laboured furiously and had to be assisted by continuous prodding in order to produce a ' ridiculua aua'in the shape of accounts purporting to disclose their transactions for a period of six months. Tney no doubt felt that it would be indelicate and unedifying to lift the veil from the more distant past. However, a beginning has been made and it is hoped that all departments of the Kuwait Government realis that their transactions in future must be such as to bear public scrutiny* The Shaikh continued to direct foreigh affairs and/piaii preside over the Municipality* The Consultative Assembly met occasionally during the year* Its membership is as follows:- Shaikh Abdullah as Salim, C*I.E. (President)* Shaikh Abdullah al Jabir, C.I.E* Shaikh Abdullah al Mubarak, Shaikh Fahad as Salim* Yusuf Alghanim* Yusuf Abdullatif al Hamad* Yusuf Saleh Humaidhi. Khalid as Zaid, Nusf Yusuf an Nusf* Abdul Hamid as Sana. Sulaiman Musallam* Ahmed Abdulkarim Abul* (b) Medical\ 4 (i) The Kuwait G-overnment Medical Department was under the supervision of the Syrian doctors Yahya al Hadidi and .ahined al Hawasiii, and the following Egyptians were employed in addition: Dr« Mohammed Ali Badr-ud-Din, Director of the Health Department, Dr. Riyadh Mukhtar Faraj Attached to the Education Dept. Dr. Ahmad Kasib-Dafrawi Eye Specialist e Dr. Bathina Mahmood &amp; A Shafiq Lady doctors. as well as midwives and a dresser. As Dr. Badr-ud-Din has not come to Kuwait the Syrian- Sgyptian balance is well maintained but it seems likely that the Syrians will take their departure on his arrival. The new hosjoital is nearing completion and it is hoped it will be opened early in 1948. (ii) Approximately 100.000 were treated as out-patients, 400 operations performed, 20,000 injections given, and nearly 1.000 X-Ray examinations made m the American Mission Hospital. The number of obstetrical cases in the Mission Hospital increased from 60 in 1946 to 120 in 1947. In May Dr. and Mrs Nykerk and family left for the U.S.l* on leave and Dr. M. Heusinkveld, M.D. was left in charge of the Men 1 s section and Dr.fMrs^Mary Allison, M.D. in charge of the womens 1 section. ^ (iii) 15,311 patients were treated in the Agency Charitable^ Dispensary during x 1947. The most common diseases being eye, skin, and x digestive, (iv) There was no epidemic although there were several cases of typhoid and whooping cough and generally the health of the town remained good. The supply of drugs etc. has greatly improved. The Egyptian Taha as Suwefi held the post of Director of Education throughout the year. There are at present 5 boys 1 and 3 girls 1 schools in the town with an attendance x roll of 2,075 and 648 respectively- a substantial increase over last year. The number of Egyptian teachers in Kuwait are 13. There are a total of 88 teachers including those in rural schools, the majority being Kuwaities who are on the whole poorly qualified. The Kuwait Grovernment continued to maintain the hostel in Cairo where 49 Kuwaiti students live. It is not intended to send any more boys there but to give them their secondary education in Kuwait, A sum of approximately 7 lakhs was spent on education during the year, ' ^(d) Past s_and Teleg raphs.

On the 1st May Mr* C«G.

From July 1st Messrs Cable and Wireless started direct wireless communication between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, Irailic for Saudi Arabia before July was routed via Bahrain. TJT . , automatic telephone system run by Cable and wireless now serves 145 subscribers but there are a large number ol applications for new connections. The connections will be made when tne necessary apparatus is received. (e) MUNICIPALITY . „ . . ...Hi 8 Hi#ness personally directed the affairs of the Municipality during the period under review. The Municipality account the 25th November, 1946 showed that by 60,000 rupees. s for the Islamic year ending expenditure exceeded income . .(T) About joG people, most of them Kuwaities of Persian origin, left for the Haj m 1947, About iOO pilgrims proceeded on camels and the rest performed the journey either by lorry or by car. Charges were from k500/~ to a 600/- for those travelling on camel back, and k2,000A per seat by saloon car and L4,000A per seat by lorry or station waggon. The above charges include one pilgrim tax of kabjo/GAper person, from which only pilgrims by camel are exempt, j r &amp; Tn March and April a number of would“be pilgrims arrived here from India, xhey had no visas or endorsements for baadi Arabia end requested that their passports be made vaild fo: that country- .This was refused but some attempted to proceed without visas to oaudi Arabia and were turned back at Qariya* (g) Like the previous into two halves on account of year the pearling season was divided Ramadhan, but unlike last year the1 ?4) i year the catch was reported to have been very poor and the prices were about 50% lower. Many of those who took part were unable to earn enough to pay for their food and other necessities. The ruling prices were as follows Jewan and Shereen 9 M30/- to M20/ G-olwa/6 • to k25/“ Badla, fob/- to fo8/- Naeim, ,fo35/- to ner chow. n m ti n tt M (h) Boat Building The boat-building trade was almost at a standstill during the period under review due to the scarcity of wood, particularly teak. (i) S&amp;fax. 139 ocean-going dhows left Kuwait for Indian and African ooFts and picked up cargoes of dates from Iraq. Some returned from India with timber, charcoal, tamarind ? cement, coir mats and ropes, while others brought with tnom fish oil, coffee ? and mangrove poles from the Yemen and African ports. The average income of a sailor was PA350/- which shows a decrease over last year largely due to lower freight rates. (j) Anti-Locust Operations , In April a few scattered bands of hoppers appeared in the town and surrounding areas. The Middle East Anti-Locust Unit once again provided a detachment with its base at Kuwait to undertake operations under the supervision of Dr, Gibbons, This year there was no great invasion and the anti-locust campaign terminated in late May. V, DESERT INTERESTS 1947 was a very bad year for the bedouin. It followed a winter of poor rain and numbers of sheep and gqats failed to survive until the ”wasm M rain in November. This was followed again by over 60 days without rain, so that the year ended on an apprehensive note. Early in April there was a clash near Khadr-al' Ma on the Iraq - Saudi Arabia borders in which 4 men were killed, between the Badur (Muntafiq), a shepherd tribe or Iraq ; members of the Mutair tribe or Saudi Arabia , and The North-Eastern cart of Kuwait territory seems to be largely dominated by Shaikh Subah An Nasir who appears to have made his headquarters at Jahra. He levies toll from bedouin camping in the area and deals extensively with smugglers across the Iraq frontier. In June a lorry stolen from the Basra Petroleum Company was bought by Shaikh Subah An Nasir but, thanks to the energetic intervention of Shaikh Abdullah Al Mubarak, was intercepted just before reaching Saudi Arabian territory and was returned to its owners„ ^ Foreign InterestsVI. 'FORBIGrif IMTERliiSTS . (a) Saudi Arabia . Relations with the Saudi Government have remained friendly tnrou^giout the year. Large quantities of merchandise especially wheat have been exported to Saudi Arabia. (b) Iraq . The Kuwait Government 1 s attitude towards Iraq underwent no change. Kuwaities are still very much inconvenienced by the Iraqi visa Regulations. On the 19th April an# Iraqi camel patrol of 8 men attempted tq disarm Rashaida bedouin who were encamped South West of Umm Nigga 8 miles within Kuwait territory. Shots were exchanged and 1 man of the Iraqi patrol was killed. The Iraqis are said to have helped tnemselves to some of the goods of the Rashaida^. but representations in Baghdad only brought the usual denials from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. VII. IMjLMMM* Attempts were made to persuade the Iraqis to agree to the Shaikh placing armed guards on his date gardens in accordance with the usual practice, but without success, and the Shaikh was told to rely on an attachment order. This he did, but the tenants 1 lawyer arranged for the order to be cancelled at the critical moment and the 1947 crop went the way of its predecessors. Another year has passed without the appeals m respect of these gardens being heard in spite of energetic representations by our Embassy m Baghdad, J VIII COST OF LIVING . The cost of living has continued iis excessively high throughout the year. The wages of labourers, servants, etc. 1 2 c I*J^ se as Co^P^ny expand. A coolie now commands a wage of hxy- a day plus food and other wages are in proportion. The oupply Department continued to ration sugar, wheat and cloth at controlled rates. IX.

KWaIT OIL -CQffiAlff » ■ The year 1947 was the fdirst complete year of oil production* A quantity of 1,925,476 tons was produced and subsequently shipped by tankers* Satisfactory progress ?/as made on the Company’s installations in spite of shortage of supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In addition to the new producing wells completed during the year further development continued in the oil fields such as the laying of pipe-lines, erection of storage tanks and additional oil handling facilities. The Company’s housing scheme has also progressed satisfactorily. Arrangements have been made to build an oil loading jetty near the submarine pipe-lines at Fahahil together with cargo off loading facilities and a small boat harbour. On the completion of these the company will be able to ship large quantities of crude oil. The increase in staff during the year is shown by the following figures of the company’s personnel strength. 1S46 1947 Senior Staff 78 409 Junior Staff 144 393 Foreign Artisans 218 1266 Local labour. 1193 4317 isM 6385 XIII. THE IMPERIAL .BAHK -QF..IHA^ The Bank continued to have the confidence of the public and consequently there has been a substantial increase in deposits and in documentary credits. With the readier availability of supplies from the United Kingdom and the facility given to importers Tor most of the year of purchasing goods from various European countries against payment in sterling, the sterling exchange at the Bank’s disposal was fully employed in the constitution of credits and in payment of document ary collections received from abroad. The chief imports fromthe United Kingdom were cement, electrical equipment, piecegoods, bicyc les. radios, and cigarettes but it was easier to obtain rayon, cotton and woollen piecegoods from Italy than from the. United Kingdom. Sterling sold by the Kuwait Oil Company to the bank increase steadily and, aT the end of the year approximated to £200,000 per month* Z The exchangeThe exchange regulations ^ iraposed in Iraq and and the many trading and^exchange controls in force in Iran have encouraged* , the use of Kuwait as a port of entrepot especially for goods which may be under a monopoly elsewhere. Money conditions were easy during the year and deposits increased m spite of the large amount of capital tied up in ioreign exchange transactions. The Bank maintained a high percentage of cash to liabilities possibly because the purchase of gold for smuggling into India and Pakistan has caused an influx of rupee notes into Kuwait. Since merchants held larger stocks there was a greater demand for credit facilities to finance fresh business and merchants are beginning to regard a temporary advance from the bank as a normal business practice free from any discreditable implications, XIV.

MEDICAL (a) General Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, President of the Municipal Council did his best to maintain a high standard of cleanliness in Muscat and Muttrah, but Muttrah still remains a problem. The Health Department purchased considerable quantities of Pyretherum and D.D.T. for its anti malaria schemes. The pyretherum was used to a considerable extent, but the Department is still experimenting vdth the D.D.T. to discover how it can be used to the best advantage. (b) Agency Hospital The hospital remained open throughout the year. The attendance figures are given below New cases attending 10,267 Old cases re-attending 13,714 Total number of cases treated during the year Average daily attendance Total admissions to Hospital 23,aSl 66 228 / Total2 Total number of deaths in the hospital 6 Number of major operations 1 Number of minor operations 271 The most prevalent diseases were, minor septic diseases, diseases due to malnutrition, malaria, venereal disease, ear and eye diseases, dysentery, bowel diseases and T.B. Large numbers of the population suffer from ulcers and allied skin diseases. The cause is not always easy to know, but such conditions are closely connected to other diseases due to malnutrition and venereal diseases. Ear and eye diseases may also be included in the above group as being due to some lack of vitamins. Thede diseases may almost be said to be confined to the poor class of the population^. Malaria has shown a very satisfactory decrease, possibly due to the people becoming a little more malaria conscious and the Health Department's taking up of the matter seriously. This year separate figures of malaria infections as they occurred in Muscat and Muttrah were not maintained. The population of these two towns are constantly changing their abode from Mattrah to Muscat, and vice versa. The figure therefore shows only the place where the patient was resident at the time of illness not necessarily the place where infection occurred. Dysentery and Bowel diseases are very difficult to eradicate as the fly infestation of Muscat and Mutt rah is very great. Tuberculosis, like venereal disease, is regarded as a very common ailment and no regard is paid to their evil consequences even by the better class citizens. The Medical Store Depot at Bombay has been the main source of supply in the past. During 1947 they supplied about half of what was asked for. Supplementary indents were not complied with, as the matter of further supplies has been referred to the New Indian Government, and so far no decision has been arrived at. If further supplies are not received, a requisition will have to be made to firms in the United Kingdom. / No- 4 - (e) Quarantine i During the yearjbhere was no epidemic and the Quarantine Station at Haremal remained closed. This station had repairs carried out to the buildings in 1946. New cemented roofing was also used to replace the old Date thatch. Late in January 1947 the roof of the larger building fell in. The Secretary to His Highness the Sultan accompanied by the Quarantine Medical Officer visited the station and found the wooden beams used for supporting the roofing far too fragile to be of .any use. It was proposed to obtain sanction from the Sultan to rebuild the whole place. The situation in India caused uneasiness and in order that the station may be of use immediately, the buildings were re thatched with Date. A wall has also been built around the buildings dividing the area from the village near by. The station requires a lot more attention, and the Secretary to the Sultan is aware of the situation. During the year reports were received from Dubai and other Persian Gulf Forts of a cholera outbreak. Several anti cholera measures were planned for the protection of Muscat and Muttrah but fortunately did not have to be applied. It was found that ?»hile Haremal was useful to quarantine ships and ship passengers, it was not practicable to use it for Road traffic and passengers. Haremal on the Hast coast line of Muscat can only be reached by sea. A narrow track is all that connects Haremal with Muscat by land. The road enters Muscat - Muttrah almost due West. Had any cases of cholera been imported by road and the intention been to isolate them at Haremal, it would have meant taking them through the main street of Muttrah, through the bazaar down to the sea front for embarking for Haremal. Flies abound in Muttrah and such a procedure would have completely defeated anti cholera measures. / Three5 Three thatched huts were erected outside the Toll Gate, one for persons from an infected area, one for contacts, one to be used as a hospital. Water,servants, guards, disposal of excreta were arranged, but fortunately not used or required. Anti cholera vaccine ran out and supplies could not be obtained from either India or the United Kingdom. Later the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer Bahrain sent supplies to Muscat. There were no cases of small pox in Muttrah or Muscat although alarmist rumours were current that small pox had broken out in Muttrah. Neither the Quarantine Medical Officer nor Dr. Thoms of the American Medical Mission hospital saw any such cases. The supply of vaccine lymph from India is causing anxiety. The Assistant Director of Public Health, West Punjab, states that further supply of vaccine lymph every week has been stopped till normal arrangements for mail are restored. Ms cat is not on any air route, shipping is irregular, and if India, the only country that can possibly supply Muscat with fairly fresh lymph now closes down on such supplies the situation is extremely dangerous. 3&lt;&gt; POLITICAL SITUATION (a) Tribal Very early in the year the ImanMs health was in a precarious condition and it was feared that he would die. However in March His Highness the Sultan received information from the interior that the Imam had recovered sufficiently to dispel fears of his death in the near future. At the time of the Imam 1 s illness some pressure was brought to bear on him regarding the nomination of a successor, but apparently he refused to do so. The general consensus of opinion at that time v/as that in the event of the Imam's death without his nominating a successor, serious disturbances would result in the interior in a general bid for the Iraamate. / Sheikh6 Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa bin Saleh al Harthi of Sharqiyah who had only succeeded his father the previous year, died in April, nominating Saleh bin Ahmad al Earthi as his successor. The Kinawis however decided otherwise and appointed Saleh bin Isa al Harthi the brother of the late Sheikh Mohammed as the new Sheikh f of the Sharqiyah. Another death of one of the leading personalities of the interior was that of Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamoodah al Alvi, Sheikh of the Leni u Ali tribe, Ja ! alan, otherwise known as TIalad al Amir who died in December. He was a very influential Sheikh and was independent of both the Imam and uhe Sultan of Muscat and Oman, but maintained good relations with the Sultan. He is succeeded by his son Khalid. From about August and until t) e end of the year, the tribes of trie Beni Ka’ab, Niam, Al Abu Shamis, who occupy the area Baraimi - Dhank - Yankul, displayed an unusual restlessness, carrying out continuous spasmodic raids in the Shinas and harrassing the inhabitants by looting, murdering lonely travellers and burning dwelling places. The Muscat Government were very concerned over this but did nothing practical to safeguard the inhabitants of this part of their territory. • Eventually Ismail ar Rassassi, Head Wall and Wall of Muttrah was deputed to visit the area and see what could be done to stop these attacks. Saiyid i?aisal bin Said was also sent v/ith a small party of Askers, but no effective action resulted. News was received reporting the movements of the Oil Company party operating in the Baraimi - Dhahira area and this brought protests from the Minister of Interior, although the Sultan was aware of this party's operations and had given his provisional consent. (b) Local iin Egyptian steamer 'Star of Mex' ran aground and was looted near Has al khabb in February. The Political Agent, accompanied by the Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps and Saiyid Faisal bin Said left for Has al Khabb in H.M.l.S. Dmanush with a Levy escort but found that the Captain had already abandoned ship and left. Investigations suggested that the Captain / ofcaptain 7 the Captain of the ship had entered into negotiations with the local Sheikh, Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali, for unloading the cargo, against the advice of the Wali of Sur, Sheikh Yaqoob bin Abdullah, When the tribesmen had boarded the ship to work the cargo, the was unaole to control them, he had decided to abandon the ship and together with his crew board the tanker tt British Destiny' which had arrived at the scene. Later in the month Saiyid Ahmed bin Ebrahim, Minister oi Interior went to the spot to endeavour to recover the looted cargo from the tribesmen. A considerable portion of the cargo was recovered, though not all of it. The Wali of Sur, Sheikh Yaqoob hj.n Abdullah al Hashmi was later removed from his postzcs as it wa's considered that even though the looting, was in the first place brought about through the Captain’s failure to accept his advice, he had none the less a^ter the event profited from the stolen goods. The ship owners are attempting to claim compensation for the cargo lost, but it is almost certain that the Muscat Government will not concede this. His Highness Shaikh Sir Ahmed al Jabir As Subah, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.S., Shaikh of Kuwait, came ashore at Lius cat whilst on his way to Karachi. Saiyid Shihab bin Baisal gave a big luncheon party in the Shaikh’s honour at Bait al Barza. The Shaikh very proudly and openly compared Kuwait to Muscat much to the detriment of Muscat, in the field of internal developments and social improvements. The Constitutional changes in India were watched comparatively quietly and with no unusual interest and celebrations of Independence Day were carried out on a rather small scale by the Indian and Pakistani subjects. Ihe Palestine situation had no serious repercussions in Muscat as only a very few could be expected to appreciate the situation enough to become interested or take any practical action in support of their convictions• / The- 8 - The occasion of the wedding of Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth was celebrated with enthusiasm. The Sultan sent a telegram congratulating His Majesty King George VI and offering his best wishes to the Royal couple. Telegrams of congratulations were also sent by the Khoja and Hindu com iunities, and the Khoja community sent the Princess a wedding present. A considerable number of people left Muscat, Muttrab, Oman and the Batinah for Koweit and Bahrain owing to lack of employment and fear of starvation. The total number of people who left the State during 1947 is estimated at 2,000. The following transfers among the Kalis occurred during the year. Sheikh Yaqoob bin Abdullah al Hashmi, V/ali of Sur was discharged and relieved temporarily by Sheikh Mansur bin Ghalib, the Wali of Jalalan. Saiyid ,;ohd bin Eilal bin Ali al Busaidi has h finally been appointed as the new Kali of Sur and Mansur bin Ghaliti has returned to the Ja *alan. Saiyid Badr bin Saud Wali of Gwadur was relieved by his brother Saiyid Hilal bin Saud, who was relieved as Wali of Khasab by Ibrahim bin Saud. Said bin Harab has been appointed temporary Well of Sohar. Yaqub bin Abdullah, previously V/ali of Sur has been appointed temporary Wali of Khabura, 4. TRADE (a) The following table gives the comparative values of imports and exports during the last three years. Year Imports 1944/45 Rs. 1,73,17,100/- 1945/46 Rs. 1,61,43,500/- 1946/47 Rs. 1,85,30,300/- Total imports for the year 1946/47 show an increase of 13 % over that for 1945/46• Imports from India showed a marked decrease, mainly attributable to existing export restrictions in that country. Exports Rs. 1,57,66,400/- Rs. 1,79,66,700/- Rs. 1,71,34,500/- / ThisThis deficiency was remedied by the increase of imports from the United Kingdom, Persian Gulf and Iraq, The export figures may have been much higher except that there was a temporary embargo placed by the Government of India on the import of dates into that country by steamer, and as India is the only buyer of Muscat 1 s dry dates the loss to the date trade was considerable during the period when the position was being clarified. The following table shows the percentage of imports and exports from and to other countries. Imports exports 1945/46 1946/47 1945/46 1946/47 United Kingdom 1.43$ 2.69$ 0.04$ U.3.A. 1.97$ 0.88$ 0.69$ - Australia 0.15$ 0.15$ - - China AUt 0.88$ - 0.12$ Singapore - 5.02$ - - India 49.75$ 38.64$ 53.15$ 86.65$ Persian Gulf 3.57$ 9.39$ 27.06$- 3.28$ Africa 8.27$ 8.77$ 1.58$ 1.78$ Iran 7.82$ 3.19$ 11.61$ 0.43$ Aden and Aden Protectorate 3.09$ 2.64$ 0.87$ 0.88$ Portuguese India 0.45$ 0.22$ - tm Iraq 23.46$ 27.53$ 3.13$ 0.81$ Ceylon - - 0.07$ 1.08$ Palestine - - 0.96$ 4.97$ Syria - - 0.84$ - Switzerland 0 • 04$ - - - 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 / Imports10 Imports consisted chiefly of cereals, textiles and tea, whilst fish, dates and limes were the main exports. (b) The exchange rate of the Maria Therese dollar proved to be very unsteady throughout the year, opening at Rs. 236/- to 100 M*T. dollars in January and closing at Rs. 216/- to 100 M.T. dollars in December. The rate -was never constant over a long period and contiinued decreasing in value as the year drew on. The reason for this deflation of the dollar was the decrease in the value of sdates exported and hence the consequential loss of purchasing power of the M.T. dollar. Banking regulations issuing from India governing the operation of non resident accounts and the discontinuation of the ,, Hundi n transfers also contributed to the loss in value of the dollar. The highest rate reached during the year was Rs. 268/- to 100 M.T. dollars in July and the lowest ?jas Rs.. 216/- for 100 M.T. dollars reached in December. (c) The date market opened satisfactorily, the price of the superior quality being 440 M.T. dollars per bahar of 1800 lbs in July, but dropped drastically to 195 M.T. dollars for the same quantity in December. The price of the inferior quality opened at 330 M.T. dollars per bahar in July and dropped to 160 M.T. dollars per bahar in Decembei’. The import restrictions in India which is practically the only market for dry dates were responsible for the phenomenal decrease in the price of dates and the future of Muscat dry dates is none too cheerful as far as can be seen. 5. CUSTOMS Mr. M.A. Rashid continued as Director General of the Muscat Customs throughout the year, although he was granted one month’s leave in India,during which time Mr. Jethalal officiated. 6. AIR. (a) South Arabian Air Route - The airfields at Masirah and Salalah were in use throughout the year. These airfields are operated on a care and maintenance basis and are available to aircraft for landing and refuelling but the airlines must provide their own personnel to refuel and no maintenance or servicing facilities for aircraft are provided. / (b)11 @&gt; (b) Civil Air Agreement - A Civil Air Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and His Highness the Sultan was signed at Dhofar by the Honourable the Political Resident and His Highness on the 5th April 1947. 7. FRENCH INTERESTS The French Consulate remained closed throughout the year. Four French warships called at Murbat in Dhofar during March. They were described as one large and three small ships, one of the smaller vessels had engine trouble and the ships left Murbat after carrying out the repairs, and during the period of their stay only their interpreter went ashore. 8. AMERICAN IlffBRESTS A party of American Trans World Airlines officials accompanied by life*. Waldo Bailey, Vice Consul, Dhahran and one General arrived in Muscat by air during March for one day. Their visit was in connection with the use of aerodromes in Muscat territory by the Trans World Airlines of America. The United States Destroyer ’’Hyman” (3,000 tons) with Captain R.I. Wolverton and Commander j/E. Smith, in command, visited Muscat in May and left after three days. The men were smart and well behaved and their visit was appreciated by the Sultan’s representative, Saiyid Shihab, acting on behalf of His Highness as this was the first American warship to call at Ms cat for 40/50 years. 9. MISSIONARY WORK Reverend Dykstra and Dr. W.W. Thoms, M.D. served on behalf of the Dutch Reformed Mission in Muscat throughout the year. Both Mr. Dykstra and Dr. Thoms attended a Mission Conference in Basrah in November and during their absence the Muscat Government ordered the Mission School to be closed on the grounds that the Muscat Government had not been asked permission to open it in the first place. The Mission authorities it is understood wrote direct to the Sultan for his assistance in settling the question. / io12 10. SLAVSRY 12 slaves applied for manumission certificates during 1947 and 10 were granted. Of the 12 applicants, 8 were captured slaves and the remainder were born slaves. 11 • ShBIff ACTIVITIES Nothing to report. 12. TEATHEE The maximum, minimum temperatures, the highest humidity and the total rainfall for the year are given below. The highest average maximum was 102.8 (the month of May)• The lowest average minimum was 65.8 (the month of February). The highest humidity was 99 % (the month of May). Total rainfall during the year amounted to 3*50 inches. PART II 1. RULING FAMILY (a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur His Highness, was absent from Muscat throughout the year, and all matters requiring his personal attention had to be transmitted to Salalah. His Highness’ prolonged absence from the capital has placed a big responsibility on his Ministers and Government officials, and the trend of public opinion is that these officials have acted in a manner more for their own interests than for the interests of the State. The Sultan is evidently aware of this and is very keen to obtain the services of a British Officer for his Foreign Secretary, and, to generally supervise the administration during his absences from the capital. The Sultan’s return to Muscat was delayed owing to the fact that the Petroleum Concessions Limited Geologists’ party postponed their visit to Dhofar until February 1948 and His Highness considered his presence in Dhofar essential to ensure satisfactory arrangements were made for the period of the geologist party’s visit. His Highness has been / attempting/ 2 13 attempting a little exploration on his own and discovered what he hopes will prove to be a profitable mica mine, and also high quality iron ore deposits. The report of Sir Cyril Fox, Director of Geological Survey of India, at the time, who surveyed the Dhofar region early in the year, has given His Highness high hopes of the potential mineral wealth of that region of his territory. His Highness maintained good health throughout the year, but proposes visiting Bombay shortly for a thorough medical examination and attention by dental, and eye specialists. ^ (b) Saiyid Shihab bin Faisal He continued acting as His Highness the Sultan^ representative at Ceremonials throughout the year. On the occasion of the visit of the U.S. Destroyer ,, Eyman ,, to Muscat in f&amp;y, Saiyid Shihab entertained the Captain and other officers at an Arab luncheon, and presented the Captain with a silver teapot and sugar bowl as a gift. Saiyid Shihab has not been keeping very well and intends going to Sohar after the Sultan’s return, if the Sultan will permit him. (c) S aiyid Taimur bin Faisal The ex Sultan remained in India throughout the year, but is planning a visit to Dhofar sometime in 1948. (d) Saiyid Ahmed bin Ebrahim He remained in office as the Minister for the Interior. The Sultan evidently expressed his disapproval of Saiyid Ahmed’s handling of the ’’Star of Mex” case and at one time he feared that he was in ^ danger of losing his post. (e) Saiyid Tariq bin Tiamur He continued as president, Municipal Council throughout the year. (f) Saiyid Fahr bin Taimur Saiyid Fahr bntered the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun at the beginning of the year and tv/o reports from the Academy show that he impressed the authorities very favourably and was considered almost, the , best cadet of his platoon.14 2. MNICIPAL AFFAIRS The President of the Municipal Council, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur devoted his energies to maintaining and even improving the cleanliness of the streets and roads of Muscat, but Muttrah proved too difficult a problem with the resources at his disposal, and the difficulty of obtaining the co-operation of the inhabitants. Wo tangible progress was made in improvements and repairs and new constructions of municipal facilities owing to the non-availability of cement at moderate rates. 3. EDUCATION The standard of teaching and in fact general training of the pupils of the Saiyidieh School ; as been raised considerably under the direction of Ghalib Naqshbandi the Palestinian Headmaster. He stresses the importance of physical fitness as well.as education and has inaugurated compulsory games of volley ball, and other outdoor sports for the boys, and even takes them out into the country and sea shore for week ends. The girls' school too, it is reported has made rapid advancement towards raising the standard of education under the supervision of Mistress Munirah, niece of Ghalib Kaqshbandi the Headmaster of the Boys' School. 4. GENERAL COMMUNICATIONS For the major portion of the year Muscat was in direct cable communication with Aden only,owing to frequent temporary interru.ptions of the Bahrain and Buspire cables. The Muscat - Karachi cable which was destroyed by earthquake in November 1945 was re-layed by the cable .ship Recorder in November. Direct cable communication now exists with Karachi, ,aden and Bahrain. The cable ships 'Cable Enterprise', 'Norseman' 'Bullfinch' and 'Recorder' visited the area on repair work. Colonel H. Bloodworth, C.B.E. of Cable and Wireless, visited Muscat in June to carry out a survey on the possibility of installing an automatic telephone system in the towns of Muscat and Muttrah. The plans of the proposed system have been submitted to His Highness the Sultan for his approval. / As15 As a result of constitutional changes in India, the post offices at Muscat and Gv/adur are now administered by the Pakistan Posts and Telegraphs Department. 5. TR ANSPORT External - 17 mail steamers from India and 21 from the Persian Gulf called at Muscat during during 1947. The following oil tankers called at Muscats- Khuzistan S trips British Chemist 1 trip Southern Collins 1 trip. The following foreign steamers called Salvore (Italian cargo vessel) Herdis (Norwegian cargo vessel). 6. POLICE Subedar Faqir Mohd remained in charge of the Police Force throughout the year. 7. DEFENCE Captain J.E.K. Hudson commanded the Muscat Levy Corps until August 1947 when he left for the United Kingdom. Subedar Major Allah Dad 0.1.I. officiated as Commandant of the Levy Corps from August until the arrival of the new Commandant, Major T.Po Greenwood, late of the Baluch Regiment Quetta. 8. 9, ROYAL .,iVY 1 ROIhiL I.-DLa..

ANTI LOCUST OPERATIONS Nothing to report. / GWADURmmmm - 16 - GV/iiDUR 1. BRITISH kOlim Mr* Hidayataullah throughout the year. 2. THE TALI Saiyid Badr bin Saud from the first of January until the beginning of December 1947, when he was relieved by QaziDAdmohd son of Mr Khan Qazi of the Shara Coufct, temporarily. 3. ADI •IINISTRAT OR Mr• Abdur Rahman, throughout the year. His status appears to be rather questionable, as he has no official authority, and his tasks entail municipal responsibilities and the supervision of the issue of rationed commodities, but apparently he has no power to enforce his orders if they are not acceptable to the Wall, or even to a majority of the population. 4. TRADE The figures of imports and exports are included in those for Muscat. On the whole the shipping programme was good, and early in the year Messrs Anderson and Sunter of the B.I.S.N. Col Ltd. Bombay, visited Gwadur and attended a meeting of local merchants where their requirements and difficulties were discussed. Gwadur’s fish markets in Karachi and Colombo remained favourable, although during March there was a serious fall in the price of fish in Colombo from Rs. 18/- to Rs. 10/- per cwt which affected the prices in Gwadur. The accumulated cotton stocks lying at Gwadur since the early part of the 1939/45 war has now been declared free from infestation by the entomologist from Baluchistan and it is expected that these stocks will be cleared to Karachi in the near future, free from import duty. 5. GENERAL In August the mooring buoys laid in the west bay at Gv/adur by the British Overseas^Corporation, Karachi, broke their moorings and were washed ashore. The B.O.A.C. authorities were informed but took no further action. / GwadurG\mdnr went through a food crisis about the middle of the year and the situation was saved by the timely arrival of a consignment of rice and atta from Karachi. Under arrangements made by the Political Agency Ms cat, two teachers, one for Urdu and one for English, arrived in Gwadur from Pakistan in the employ of the Ms cat Government and the attendance of the School already stands at SO. Arrangements have also been completed for the services of a Doctor and he should arrive early in the new year. 6. POLITICO Kalat State politicians are known to be very keen on attaining the retrocession of Gwadur to Kalat, and this plan was included on the agenda at the last meeting of the Kalat State National Party. His Majesty’s Pakistan Ship ’’Godavari 1 * paid a courtesy visit to Gwadur in November and the Captain and crew were welcomed cordially. 7. POSTS AID TELEGRAPHS Mail steamers called at Gwadur approximately two in one and a half months in each direction during the year. The Gwadur - Pasni landline was continually interrupted throughout the year owing to frequent breaks in the line, and it is considered that the landline should be replaced by the installation of a wireless set at Gwadur, as this would ensure constant communication with the outside world. 8. COMMUNICATIONS During the year 20 ships from Karachi and 18 from the Persian Gulf called at Gwadur. 9. ANT I-LOCUST OPERATIONS The Anti-locust partycontinued their operations, using Gwadur as their Headquarters and making frequent trips into the interior. The Locust Technical Officer and Warning Officer were reposted to India in June. 10. AIR FACILITIES The aerodrome remained unserviceable throughout the year.ixiS&amp;Aimoa o?

It i© a most appropriate name because it literally is what the name suggests, Guadur is situated in the Gulf of Oman on the fiekran coast and 1© a dependency of the duxtan of Muscat and Oman* It ie a natural sea port with great ' potentiality for development, me tom of Guadur with an estimated population of Boo© is built on a picturesque strip of sandy tract dotted all over by tall graceful date-palm trees which present a very delightful view. The town ie surrounded on three side© by the Arabian sea and is lying between the two bays near the end of a narrow strip of land about three miles long and half to one-fourth of a mile in width and is connected with the main coast from the north, mie f T' shaped projection in the sea ends in the south with J a velff called *Koh Bat ail ’ • The town is built on sandy but hard bank of the eastern bay on a little raised ground and consists mostly of said buildings. There are eeveral good buildings aleo of which *Jum&amp;xkhana’ of the Aghakhanis i© the most conspicuous,vmich 1® a permanent structure of good and coloured design. The town was slightly damaged in the oarthi|uake of 1945# particularly those building© as were directly exposed to the sea. The sea is encroach ing gradually and ha© notched the bank badly from the British Agent*t office to the fish go downs, a distance of about quarter mile,leaving it in a most ragged condition* There are several half washed build ing® still standing on the edge of the bank and the impression they give is not quit® pleasant* Although no Immediate danger is antici pated, yet it 1® feared, the tom in the event of similar natural cause® a® mentioned above^ will be left at the mercy of angry sea which generally take a heavy toll in such cases* lleeesrlty of some kind of preventive measure i® naturally obvious, but inview of the prohibitive expenditure involved, it can not be contemplated at pro* sent* 2* The reef in the south extends about 11 miles from east to ^cst and ie about t to 2 mile® in width. There is a cultivable catchment aroa on top of the roof which is entirely dependent on rainfall and whenever there are good rain® produces suffloat quantity of vegetable to meat the local requirement of the town. There also exist an ancient masonry dam in the catchment area although it i® in a bad state of repair® now. . 3* Guadur ha© no permanent source of irrigation and it can not be stated definitely whether or not the natural water resource® can be tapped effectively unless experiments under technical supervision- 2 - 0;' 'ji are made to bore either art i si an wells or locate some other natural V. i source. (Che town gets its drinking water supply from the temporary wells dug in purely sandy soil towards northern side of the town ' just between the Sast and West Bays near the 5brt in the narrowest place of the projected strip. Water is slightly saltish, but other wise is considered quite fit for human consumption. Bo particular complaint has ever been reported which would suggest possibility of its containing any injurious substance. Guadue has a temperate climate and is considered to be one of the most healthy place in the coastal towns of the Gulf. 4. Guadur is also wellknown for trade. On the Mekran coast it is the only port which serves as the distributing centre for the produce of Mekran, such as Ghee, cotton, wheat, cereals, dates goat-hair and wool. Its indigenous produce is fish which is famous both for quality as well as va&amp;Lety, and also provide main source of occupation to the local inhabitants of the place. Prosperity of the whole town depends on the fish trade mainly which after being salted and dried is exported mostly to Colombo and some to Hongkong 5. 3ur and Pishukan are the two subsidiary small ports which fall under the jurisdiction of Guadur. (The former is situated on the mouth of the east bay on the main coast and is about 12 miles by land route from Guadur, while the latter is on the same coast in the West Bay about 2o miles by land. Population of Sur is estimated at looo and that of Piehukan at 15oo. Both these ports are exclusively dependent on fish trade. I'KITOMsi c - » j i 6. She Government of Muscat and Oman in the welfare of its subjects and those living under its protection some time ago decided to improve the general conditions of Guadur by introducing 1 executive and municipal reforms in its dependency at the cost of heavy expenditure. As a result of this commendable decision, a post of Administrator was created and K.B.Abdul Hai, MM; a learned and experienced retired officer of the Government of India was appointee in that post on contract basis with a view to execute various schemes and proposals connected with reforms. Khan Bahadur, however,' could not make much progress due to non-availability of medical, * educational and other technical staff which the Government had sanctioned for this pupose and eventually after about nine months stay was compelled to relinquish charge of his duties on account of a sudden attack of serious illness. The post of administrator after Khan Bahadur's departure in September 1946, remained vacant when it was again filled up by the undersigned in the end of Feb- ruaiy, 1947 whose services had been requisitioned on deputation from the Baluchistan Administration by the Government of Muscat and Oman. ?• It was ofcourse obvious from the very begining that no practical ..•••» -3- (g rHap© could oe given to the various well considered ocneiaes sanc tioned by the Govemz&amp;ecit unless tfte necessary staff was first recruited, Aat recruitment of staff was unfortunately delayed inspite of continuous efforts due to unsettled conditions then prevailing in India. ft* 'mpplis8°^ j* B » **** wltii the situation resulting from the universal iiiortage of essential commodities and to improve the rationing system, a Control Committee consisting of 11 members from the officials, gentry and merchant community was formed in the begining of the year under report. Main function of the Committee i fe» to ensure by devising cuch workable means according to the local conditions, as would result in equitable distribution of essential commodities to the public on rates fixed by the committee. Allowing margin for unavoidable pilferage and profiteering, the system levies under guidance of the Administrator had been working satisfactorily on the whole, a detailed report in this connection had already bean made vide '3.0.Ho.9/9-47, dated the 2oth. January, 1948, to the address of the Cecrotaxy to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman* Copies of the proceedings of meetings held were also fUmished to the secretary from time to time. -i-— * | 9* improve sanitation, street-lighting and other important affaire connect ad with the civic life, the municipality which existed already in a miniature form was expanded by forming a committee of six nominated members from the Baluchis, Hghakhanls and Hindu communities with a ratio of 3-2-1 respectively on the lines and principle of the municipality in Muscat. But due to un- foreeon circumstances the committee could not function properly as it should have done. Bemiee of Kauda Abdulla, one of the leading members of the committee, whose substitute is still in Karachi settling buseine86 affairs of his deceased father and long absence of two other leading members from the ,*ghakhaai8 i.e. doth r?ahmat~ ulla^Bashlr and oeth Badeall—Ahmad who are hi so in Karachi settling tneir bossiness affairs &amp; arising from the evacuation of Hindu merchants of that place are the main causes for the above explained 1 position. However, efforts are being made either to replace theme mauibers by those who retdde better part of tne year in Quadur or some aich mitable arrangement as would facilitate proper function ox the committee. 5?he matter has already be n referred to the rtgfcaiiuani Council at Guadur. ^soaranc© has bo n given that the &lt;iU©&amp;tion will be dircueeed and settled by the Council as soon as its quorum Is complete. From the info itu at ion received, it is belimv^i the committee will be able to strart its function properly by the and of march or at the latest beglning of April 1948. 1o. fne post of Sanitary Inspector remained vacant during the whole year. Although sanitation, as far as was possible, has been improved, yet there still remain much to be done in this reflect. The sanitary staff of ten sweepers only is inadefpiatG * i4~ and can not coup with ths requirement of the town. Strenuous efforts will be needed waen the committee meets to devise work able means according to the existing financial position of the ' municipality, for the Improvement of the sanitary conditions of the town* By that time It is hoped Ifir. !Pufail of the Arab Hospital Bhahran, who is the only qualified applicant for the post of Sanitary Inspector and who had been offered very generous terms, will also arrive in Guadur to take charge of his duties* 11. A definite Improvement has been made in the arrangment of street-lighting. j^edicril 'tl2* In spite of repeated efforts and most reasonable terms offered for the post of Medical Officer for Guadur, the post,due to unsusual circumstances explained in para 6 aDove, remained vacant during the year under report* From the correspon- dance and private information received in this connection, it appears that Dr* Bashir Ahmad, M.B.B.S., has accepted the terms and will reach Guadur as soon as his passage Is arranged. Nothing is known as yet about the appointment of a Compounder whose post has already been sanctioned by the Govern ment. If due to unsettled conditions prevailing In the two new dominiions,a compounder can not be recruited fxom there, then (subject to the approval of the Government) an educated person might be trained locally by the doctor on the later's arrival. 13. Pending construction of a new building for Hospital, a dispensary will be started in a rented building for which arrangement has already been made. It is believed medical equip ment and stores have been received in Muscat from Bombay. Arrange ment may kindly be made to send the stores etc to Guadur, so that dispensary may be started Immediately on doctor's arrival. 14. List of furniture required for the dispensary has already been furnished vide this office letter No. 32o dated the 19th. December, 1947* Bxport permit for the furniture is still awaited. Arrangements have been made with a local merchant who has started a firm of erportes in Karachi, to purchase the furniture and arrange its safe dispatch to Guadur when the permit is received by him. In the mean time he hab been asked to submit estimate of the cost of furniture details of which have also been supplied to him. The permit was originally asked for in the name of firm Messrs. Lalchand-Kaliaadass, but according to the latest infor mation received, as will be seen from the enclosed letter, the firm named above is closing its bussiness at Karachi and shifting to Bombay. The permit, if possible, may please be changed in the name of'auleman Ha sham’ whose full address is given in the enclosec letter.mm*™,,my, ji tiblic * 0 &amp;zu j 'lii* In til* bud£ 0 t ior tr*« y«4iT 194t» t taaouax of lu 22,amctlon&amp;d by tins (hrenmmt uiidos mn-rtmrztng ox^mulitvro for conetxuetion a I a part of th« ssuulcipaX ofXlco t tfczio :i mtld&amp;ng and ttoepltol.
