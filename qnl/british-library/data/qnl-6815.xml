D India Office, London, 20th June 1913. Political, No. 59. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My Lord, With reference to Your Excellency’s letter of the 27th July 1911, diction, in the form that has now been approved by His Majesty. 2. With regard to the amended list enclosed in the letter of 1st August 1912 from your Secretary in the Foreign Department, I have to make the following observations :— (а) The Royal Standard, being the personal flag of the Sovereign, is only to be hoisted when His Majesty is present in person, as laid down in paragraph 1806 of the King’s Regulations and Orders for the Army, 1912. A salute for the Royal Standard has accordingly been omitted. (б) A salute of 21 guns is prescribed for Foreign Sovereigns and Members of their families, for the Maharajadhiraja of Nepal and the Sultans of Maskat and Zanzibar. It has been decided that the except ional salutes of 31 guns granted to the Amir of Afghanistan and His Imperial and Royal Highness the German Crown Prince when visiting India are not to form a precedent for future occasions. (c) A salute of 19 guns for Ambassadors is alone retained in the list, other diplomatic officers of His Majesty not being entitled to a salute outside the precincts of the nation to which they are accredited. (d) With a view to convenience of reference, the salutes in Part I. of the list have been re-arranged. 3. With reference to Your Excellency’s letter of the 27th March last, No. 25, Foreign, the proposal to grant a personal salute of nine guns to the Amir of Dthala has been approved by His Majesty, and the necessary addition has been made to Part II. of the List. 4. With regard to Part I., I am of opinion that, under the authority conveyed by the note to the Order in Council of the 23rd January 1860, the Viceroy and Governor-General has power to grant salutes for civil Salutes fired within the juris diction of the Government of India. No. 8J, Foreign, I forward for your information a copy of the list of salutes fired within your juris-and military officers holding positions and commands other than those , laid down in the Table accom- * To Foreign Office, War Office, and . n i it ^ Admiralty, dated 17th February 1913. panymg the Order, and 1 see no From Foreign Office, dated 20th Feb- reason w } 1 y this power should not ruary 1913. . . .

In this connection, however, he mentioned wiU.^some he ’ knew begging that he might be pardoned for speaking X J- corine ction with his thft he must have received cordial diplomatic support from B [•2968 m —2]recent trouble with Vali Nazif Bey, yet he had felt rather “ left,” at the time, by my not arranging for one of His Majesty’s ships to come up promptly when the Zain incident took place and there was a possibility of the vali following up his attack 011 ^ his village by action against Failiyah or Moharnmerah. In reply to this, I assured hinf that Mr. Wilson and I here, and the Foreign Offices in India and London, were vigilantly watching his interests ; that it was thought that the premature drspatc i of a ship might only prejudice the amicable settlement which it was so important to arrange, but that a ship was all the time waiting, under orders to proceed at a moment s notice, and would have come at once if our information from Bussorah or Constantinople had indicated that any further aggression was really likely. I had my dossier of the case with me, and, in order to convince the sheikh of the complete sincerity of our attitude, I turned to Sir Edward Grey s telegram of the 9th May to Sir Gerard Lowther (No. 97), and ventured to explain the gist of it to the sheikh. On realising how thorough and frank had been the attitude of His Majesty s Government in safeguarding him against further aggression, he was more than reassured, and again expressed his deep sense of obligation for our support. During the same interview he mentioned that the assurances as now given did not refer to the question of his customs or to our own probable attitude towards him in the event of the break-up of Persia. These points were covered by items 5 and 6 of Foreign Office despatch No. 108, dated the 6th July, to Mr. Marling, and I disposed of them on the lines indicated by His Majesty’s Secretary of State in that communication. The sheikh did not press them, saying that he was now greatly reassured by what we had given him, and most grateful for the document now vouchsafed. As regards his customs, he ultimately made a fresh proposal or offer which requires dealing with separately on its merits. In fact, the whole question of the Mohammerah customs, by the light of eight years of the Belgian administration, needs bringing up to date, and I have asked Lieutenant Wilson to draw up a memorandum on the subject, and submit it with the sheikh’s present proposal. 6. I should mention that on arrival at Mohammerah I found the Sheikh of Koweit in his launch, anchored at Failiyah alongside Sheikh Khazal’s palace. It seemed to me that his presence at the presentation of the K.C.I.E. to his fidus Achates might be taken advantage of to revive the former reports crediting the two sheikhs with sinister Arab ambitions, to which we lent secret encouragement. I therefore had a talk with Sheikh Mubarak, who readily fell in with my views (in which Sheikh Khazal inwardly concurred), and spent the day of the ceremony at Bussorah, with Ahmed Zuhair Pasha, returning the morning afterwards. 7. I am sending this communication with enclosures (of which I attach a list) via London, with a copy to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, and am also forwarding a copy to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Consul-General Cox to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, October 23, 1910. IN continuation of my letter dated the 9th October, 1910, to your address, I have the honour to acquaint you that the insignia of a Knight Commander of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire were duly delivered to Sheikh Khazal Khan, Sheikh of Mohammerah, in Durbar at his palace at Failiyah on the 15th instant, the ceremony being as follows :— 2. I proceeded from Bushire in His Majesty’s ship Bedbreast,” placed at my disposal by the senior naval officer, arriving at Mohammerah on the afternoon of the 13th October, soon after which I received a visit from Haji Bais at the consulate. On the 14th, accompanied by His Majesty’s consul, I visited the sheikh to inform him of my mission, and to arrange the day and hour for the function and details of the ceremony to be observed. It was arranged that the presentation of the K.C.I.E. should take place the following morning in Durbar at the Failiyah Palace at about 9 A.M., and the Persian Foreign Office agent, the headmen of the sheikh’s various tribes, the European community, andvarious local officials and notables were invited by the sheikh, or summoned to be present. About 8 a.m. Lieutenant Wilson, His Majesty’s consul, and I went on board His Majesty’s ship “Redbreast,” lying at the anchorage at Mohammerah ; she then J^ieamed up the river to Failiyah and anchored opposite the sheikh’s palace. On her ^wrival there Sheikh Chasib, the sheikh’s eldest son and heir, accompanied by Haji Rais, the sheikh’s chief adviser, came on board officially to welcome me on behalf of his father, and on leaving His Majesty’s ship, after a short interview, received for the first time the salute of five guns recently granted to him by the Government of India. It was arranged with Sheikh Chasib that as soon as all those expected had arrived and taken their seats a bugle should be sounded on shore, to let us know that they were ready for us to land. At about 9*30 a.m., the bugle having sounded, I landed, under my official salute, with His Majesty’s consul, and Lieutenant-Commander the Honourable R. O. Bridgeman, with three of his officers, was good enough to support us. His Excellency the Sheikh, with his sons and chief retainers, received my party at the landing steps and conducted us to the Durbar hall. For this purpose the fine verandah in front of the palace had been fitted up. The floor was carpeted with Persian rugs, and the Durbaris were arranged in two long rows of seats, with the sheikh on one side and I myselt opposite to him at the top of the other. At the head of the avenue between the sheikh and myself Sheikh Chasib and his three picturesque little brothers were seated, Oriental fashion, on the carpet. If gossip and journalistic misrepresentation were to be avoided it appeared to me essential that the presentation of the insignia should be accompanied by some observations from me and a reply from the sheikh, and accordingly the terms of both had been discussed between us the previous day. It was considered that, in order not to touch Persian susceptibilities, the vernacular used should be Persian ; and as the sheikh was shy of making formal remarks to an audience in that language it was arranged that our respective addresses should be read by my mirza and Haji Rais respectively, I delivering the former in English for the edification of the European community. Copies of both, in English and Persian,* are attached. Having concluded my observations, I stepped across the verandah and affixed the insignia on the sheikh’s robe. As I did so His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast, b} prearranged signal, fired his Excellency’s salute of twelve jguns, which was in due course returned from the shore. His acknowledgment having been recited, we resumed our seats, and held further conversation while his Excellency’s band discoursed music and refreshments were served to the guests. The sheikh had now lost any shyness which he may have started with, and enlarged upon his great appreciation of the honour done him and his great obligations to His Majesty’s Government. After a quarter of an hour’s conversation I took leave and the Durbar broke up, the sheikh conducting me and my party to the landing stage, his band playing our National Anthem as we left. On our returning on board, His Majesty’s ship “Redbreast steamed back to her anchorage at Mohammerah, and the proceedings thus terminated. I informed the sheikh that the sanad or grant of His Majesty the King conferring the dignity was on its way from London by mail, and would be delivered to him m ue course. I have, &amp;c. P. Z.

Your Excellency, „ . .. , ^ ^ IT is over a year now since I have had the pleasure of visiting you ashore, owing firstly to absence in Europe, and secondly to quarantine difficulties since ni v re urn. This has been a cause of regret to me, but I am very glad now o e a e * Persian not reproduced. ^ ^ [2968 m —2]your Excellency here in your palace at l ailiyah, and the pleasure ol coming has been greatly enhanced by the auspicious nature of my present errand.

Unfortunately, as we all know, many districts in Persia have now for a long time been disturbed and trade routes interrupted. It is therefore all the more a matter of congratulation to you that this region has not fallen into a similar plight. With this short preface, I will proceed to present your Excellency with the said decoration, and in doing so 1 need only add the hope that you may long be preserved to render loyal and patriotic services to your own Government and to continue, as in ttm past, to promote the cordial relations which have long existed between the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and the British Government, from the time of Sheikh Haji Jabir Khan until now. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Terms in which his Excellency Sheikh Khcizal K han, Sheikh of MohaniTYierah, returned thanks for his presentation with the Order of K.C.I.E. on October 15, 1910. (English translation.) Your Excellency,* I FEEL most grateful and proud at this indication of the favour of His Majesty King George Y (may his kingdom endure). Well aware as I am of the cordial relations and sincere friendship existing between the British Government and my own, it is with great pride that I adorn my breast with this august decoration, and I pray God that the sincere friendship between the two Governments may be steadfast and enduring, and that the Almighty may ordain that I should render service and devotion to mv own Government, so that by such means and by preservation of order and security in the limits and dependencies of my jurisdiction the safety of the trade routes and of internal and foreign commerce may be assured, and I may earn the approval of the British Government to an increasing degree. I am grateful and obliged for your presence here to-day, and beg you to convey my most sincere thanks to the- British Government for the great distinction now conferred on me. Enclosure 5 in No. 1.

THOUGH I expressed my gratitude in my speech at yesterday’s gathering, I feel it necessary now to convey my thanks more fully for the various demonstrations of good-will and the benevolent advice with which I have been favoured during these three years past by your Honour and the high authorities of the British Government—signs which have been present alike during the struggle between the partisans of despotism and constitutionalism, in connection with the aggressive proceedings of the Yali of Bussorah at Kut-i-Zain (in regard to which question they found me to he in the right), in the increase of my salute as a personal distinction, and now in the bestowal of this present honour with its august insignia, and in other ways which are a source of encouragement to me. I feel the utmost gratitude and pride for these favours, and it goes without saying that my position in the future will be the stronger for them ; while the prosperity of Mohammerah and its dependencies will be increased, and foreign commerce and enterprise promoted therein.

We agree with the Government of Bombay that permanent salutes of nine guns may suitably be fixed for the Jamadar of Shehr and Mokalla and for the Sultan of Kishn and Socotra, who would thus be placed on the same footing as the Eadthli and Lahej Sultans, and that the salute of twelve guns, which is now accorded to the Jamadar of Shehr and Mokalla, should be continued to the present Chief as a personal salute. We trust that these recommendations will meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble servants, (Signed) CURZON. „ A.

I am directed to refer to the revised Table of Salutes to Native Chiefs and Nobles of India and to certain Chiefs near Aden, which was forwarded with my letter No. 10671.-A., dated the 11th March 1901. 2. The table includes permanent salutes of nine guns each to the Padthli and Lahej Sultans, and personal salutes of 12 guns to the Jamadar of Shehr and Mokalla, and of nine guns to the Sultan of Kishn and Socotra. These four Chiefs are under the protection of the British Government, and it appears anomalous that they should be treated differently. ^ I am accordingly to enquire whether, in the opinion of the Governor in Council, it is not desirable that the salutes accorded to all these Chiefships should be regarded as permanent, personal salutes of a few guns higher being recommended, if necessary, for individuals. If the Governor in Council accepts this view, I am to invite precise recom mendations on the subject. No. 4275, dated Bombay Castle, the 14th June 1901 (Confidential). From—J. L.

My Lord, We have the honour to forward a revised Table of the Salutes granted to Native Chiefs and Nobles of India and to certain Chiefs near Aden. 2. The Table was last revised in 1896, since which date the changes noted below have occurred:— {a) On the reconstitution of the State of Jhalawar in Eajputana, the salute attached to the Chief ship was fixed, under the authority of Her late Majesty the Queen, Empress of India, at 11 guns. (&amp;) Her late Majesty further approved of the grant of personal salutes of 21 guns to His Highness Maharana Sir Eateh Singh Bahadur, G.C.S.I., of Mewar (IJdaipur), and to His Highness Maharaja Sir Bala Eama Varma, G.C.S.I., of Travancore; and of the addition of two guns to the personal salute of His Highness Eaja Sir Hira Singh Bahadur, G.C.S.I., of Nabha. (0) The undermentioned Chiefs died on the dates noted against their names, and their personal salutes have lapsed :— His Highness Eaj Sahib Sir Mansinghji Eanmalsinghji, K.C.S.I., of Dhrangadra (15 guns), 19th November 1900.

It appears to us anomalous that the salutes of the Eadthli and Lahej Sultans should he permanent, while those of the Jamadar of Shihr and Mokalla and of the Sultan of Kishn and Socotra are personal. This ^ distribution is, however, in accordance with existing orders. We are consulting the Govern ment of Bombay on the subject of the salutes for Chiefs near Aden, and we shall in due course acquaint Your Lordship with the conclusions at which we may arrive.
