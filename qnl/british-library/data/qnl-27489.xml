I agree that it would be well worth the Sultan's while to appoint an Agent in the U.K. for obtaining his requirements there as the Bahrain Government have done, but I am rather inclined to suggest, instead of giving Messrs. Kendall a monopoly, we might consider recommending another firm; and it occurred to me that Keymer, Son &amp; Co. who have done business for the Nepalese Government for many years, particularly in regard to several engineering works might be suitable. Kenneth Keumer called at my request today and left with me the enclosed pamphlet, saying that his firm would be interested to hear more about the project and would appreciate making your acquaintance when you are here next month. I think it would be wort} your while having a talk with Keymer, whom I have known for several years past, and who strikes me as being entirely reliable and efficient. If the Sultan were to appoint a British adviser it woul&lt; of course be very desirable that he should work in close touch with any Agent the Muscat State might appoint in London. Yours sincerely, Sd. E.P. Donaldson. CONFIDENTIAL No. 1104-S Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 7th June, 1947. without enclosure Copy/forwarded with compliments to for information only.

He might also it he wishes advertise for an agent in the home papers but in these circumstances I think he would be well advised to consult us before making a final selection. 3. If you see no objection you might perhaps discuss the whole matter with the Sultan when you next meet him and ascertain what action if any he proposes to take.

PURCHASING AGENT FOR SULTAN OF MUSCAT IN UNITED KINGDOMDated 15th April, 1948 Dust a line to let you know we have been asked by the Middle East Secretariat of the Foreign Office, if we would like to act as Supply Agents for His Highness the Sultan on similar lines to our Agreement with Bahrain. We had a meeting yesterday afternoon with Mr. Dundas and Miss Waterlow at the Foreign Office, when it was agreed that we should open negotiations on the general lines . of our Agreement with Bahrain. As regards the actual figures to be inserted in the Agreement, if indeed Muscat should decide to appoint us, we have asked that they be left in abeyance until we get some idea of the volume of orders they anticipate placing during the next few years. For your personal information, I enclose a copy of the letter we have addressed to the Foreign Office today. We very much hope that we shall be lucky enough to be appointed for this purpose, which will further cement our existing good relations with the Gulf. 1 trust that all goes well with you and yours and we all here join in sending you a our very best regards.

We have the honour to confirm our conversation yesterday after noon at the Foreign Office with Mr. R.G. Dundas and Miss Waterlow. 2. As you already know, we have the honour to act as the Supply Agents and Gener- 1 Representatives for the State Government of Bahrain and we should be pleased to act in a similar capacity for His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, should he decide to confer this honour upon us. 3. You are in possession of a copy of our Service Agreement with the State Government of Bahrain and we suggest that this Agreement should form the basis of a similar Agreement with Muscat. 4. At this stage, we would however prefer to defer our decision regarding the actual amount of the Retaining f^e and rates of commission payable under the Agreement until we have a little further information regarding the approximate volume of business which His Highness contemplates placing annually in this country, for - say - the next two to three years. If you could obtain this informatidn for us, we should then immediately be in a positic to let you know our terms. 5. We are quite willing to agree that the ruling rates of commission for general orders would be modified in the event of say, a substantial Public Works Contract being negotiated through us. 6. We feel certain that, with our intimate knowledge of the Contractors, Manufacturers, and ^Suppliers in the United Kingdom together with our experience during the past two years in supplying the State Government of Bahrain, we should well be able to satis factorily arrange for all similar .supplies required by His Highness The Sultan of Muscat with a minimum delay and at competitive prices. 7. We are forwarding this letter to you in triplicate in case additional copies are required and shall be pleased to let you have any further information upon request. 8. Finally, we thake this opportunity of saying that, should we be honoured with the appointment, it would be our constant endeavoui to safeguard the interests of His Highness and give him every possible help.

We have now seen Captain Charles Kendall, Mr. Kenneth Keymer and Mr. Smith of Gellatley and Nankey, all of whom are interested in obtain this appointment for their respective firms. The two lat latter are sending particulars of their terms direct to you, as suggested in your telegram. Charles Kendall and Partners have, however, written to us, and we enclose, herewith two copies of their letter together with two copies of their agreement with the Government of Bahrain.

Your letter No. £ 4452/73/91 dated the 19th April 1948| about the appointment of a purchasing agent for the Sultan of Unseat. 2. Up to date we have not heard from Uessrs. JCerolai^, Keyrner and Gellately and Kankey, and owing to bad communicat ions with Muscat is is likely to be some months before we get anyghing final settled. It is quite possible that the Sultan of Muscat may ask us to advise him about the terms offered by the competing firms and in this case we shall need some expert guidance, which we shall probably have to ask you to obtain for us. 3. In the circumstances we would ask that the orders which are outstanding should not be held up. If the Foreign Office do not wish to be concerned with the placing of them, possibly you could furnish us with the names of some suitable firms with whom we could correspond direct.

The Sultan has informed me that he ia-disposed in favour of Gellatley Hankey &amp; Company as he considers their terms most favourable. 3. Regarding the equipment for Muscat Infantry, he has promised to write direct to Gellatley Hankey &amp; Co., and ask * them to undertake delivery, without actually committing himself in his choice of an agent until he had seen the sort of service which they give him on this ' trial order '. I fear that he has been rather flattered recently by having three British firms all anxious to serve him, as well as two banks in competition and is inclined to be a little difficult about making up his mind over business matters. I have pressed him for a decision several times. 4. On 31st May the ubiquitous Cloetta suddenly arrived without warning and In the absence of any suitable accommodation amongst the Mutrah merchants, was invited to stay at the Agency. I informed His Highness of his arrival and of his business here. I have an idea that the Sultan, who has shown great interest in Kaufmaru^s Ltd., may ask Cloetta if his firm is interested, in order to have one more tender for consideration. 5. I am sure that His Majesty’s Government could not possibly recommend Kaufmanns since it is associated with what was actually • • His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE.,CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.■MM actually its parent company in Austria, now known as Hauser &amp; Company of Vienna and with the reopening of Austria to trade, might tend to lose its present British composition. Also George Kaufmann, the Chairman, was tactless enough to appoint a Jewish staff at the Aden branch of the Company with the con sequence that his warehouse was destroyed by the mob in the recent riots l I feel that the appointment of George Kaufmann Ltd., as Purchasing Agents might for this reason prove an embarrassment to His Majesty's Gbvernment. If the Sultan ever raises the question I suggest that I might advise him, in his own interests, to restrict his choice to the three wholly British firms recommended by His Majesty’s Government. I think however, he will eventually choose Gellatley Kankey and Company.
