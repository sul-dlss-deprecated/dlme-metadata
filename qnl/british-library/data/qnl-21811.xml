A British subject in Dubai named Tiradas Dhamanmal, manager of the Firm of Dhamanmal Isardas is reported to be anti-British. The latest iniormation I received about him that he, in reply to question about the news, said to Salim bin Musabbih and Muhammad Abu Ruhaimah that the allies of the British liovernment have been defeated and the British government will soon be crushed by the Mighty uermany. This sort of remark on the Trucial Coast is highly objectionable, especially from a British subject. I suggest that I be authorised to send him back to India by the first steamer after telling him that his presence on the Trucial Coast is undesirable on account of his talk in favour of the enemy of his government. This will have very good effect on the local people and I strongly recommend we take prompt action so as to prevent repercussion on the Trucial Coast. I have not said anything to the Hindu until I receive orders from you.© Ory Extract 1'rom Memorandum Wo. 489-S dated the 10th July 1940 from the Political Resident in the Persian liulf, Bushire, to the political Agent, Bahrain. -K-rr-a- -a-a-a- ■a-a- 3.

To, H.B.M’S Political Agent. Bahrain. Respected Sir, I have received from my employers M/s Dhamanmal Iseardas peremptory orders to make arrangements to Vacate my ^ post and leave Dubai withen a month on the allegation that I have spoken against my Government. The order is a shock to me. I have been in Gulf for over 20 years, and to be orderd to leave my service bn the condition in which lam asked to do is, I consider, a disgrace on any self respecting man. To face the prospects of unemploy ment these days, to have good name for a faith!ul service manred, tp face tffe c anger of starvation of my wife and six children and above all my loylaty to my Government doubted or suspected make me perfer death to living. I have never spoken any thing against my bnign Government and as local agent of a respeetaole firm I have always considered it my duty to render as much help as I can. lam a firm believer in the final Victory of my king hmperor and I have never given any experession contrary to this inoorn faith. Out of trade Jealousy and business rivalry some one has played this game of reporting some tning against me Wiiich I did not do and lam prepared to take oath on my religion tnat I have never spoken ill against British Government. I assert lam absolutely innocent of what is reported against me. I plead for mercy in the name of my children, that my case may be reconsidered at Sharjah and if $hey are not satisfied there, ^am ready to leave Dubai in the mentionetime. If necessary I shall invoke the aid oi my employers to stand guarantee in my good Conduct. lam very much disheart^d Sir. I jand my family will be tottaly ruined. I pray your Honour to save^this time, lam at your feet Sir.
