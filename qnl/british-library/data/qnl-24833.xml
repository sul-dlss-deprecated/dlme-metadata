For convenience of reference x also enclose a French translation of articles 7, 8 , 9 , and IQ of the Decree-Law NO .26 of 1936 . 2. It will be observed that ^article 7 of the Decree-Law of 1936 stipulated that the Rector of el azhur aust be chosen from the seepage of the orand uloraa . whose composition is defined in jraiole 9 of that decree-law. The academic qualifications required of caxididates for admission to the , ^op^e of the arand Dlama are set forth in ^ticle 10; among these qualifi- c^tions is the requirement that a candidate should have belonged to the teaching bo y in one of the Faculties of el ^zhar for at least ten years or have, occupied, for at least fifteen years, the post of lufti or of Lheri , mgistrate or one of the scientific posts in the administration of el zh^r. In addition this article required that a candidate for the Ajrdopage of Grand ulema should be proposed by a three-quarters majority of the existing members of that body. 3 . The effect of Law no.123 of 1946 ie to broaden eonsiderably the basis of thd selection of candidates for the Rectorship and Vice-xiectorship. This law now /aakes it possible to appoint ae Rector or vice-Rector men who may be other than members of the body of Grand uleu . and also men whose teaching Career may have been Halted to on© of the Faculties of the two lay Universities. Furthermore, the minimum period of service in one or other of the qualifying posts is reduced to five years; it was for merly tea ears in the case of academic posts of the .^zhar and fifteen years in the case of e ijnfti or 3 hari # magistrate, ijiother important amendment is that a Rector who is appointed tram outside the ( jrdopuge of the Grand ulema becomes ex-officio a member of that body. 4 . it sseats evident that, following the death of sheikh al »iaraghi last August, the present Government has consist ntly had in view the desirability of appointing iiheikh ustapha ,J&gt;ciel a&amp;zek, then Minister of wekfs, as sheikh al ;4araghi*s successor. The Government was, however, confronted by the difficulty that pheikh iustapha a V bdel Razek was not a member of the .jrdopuRe of the Grand ul, .la . nor did he possess the academic qualificat ions required for admission to that body. There was naturally strong opposition to his noziin&amp;tion on the part of a majority of the Grand ulema who were understandably jealous of the legal stipulation that one of their number should oe appointed to the vauant rectorship. ,JLthough Gheikh Rustapha ^bdel Hazek is an Islamic savant and a graduate of el , v *har, his academic career, apart froxa approximately one year spent as a teacher in el ,.zhar Immediately after graduation, has been mostly spent in lay institutions. in any case he had not The Right Honourable Xrnest Bevin, M.F., FOREIGN OFFICE. /taught- r&gt; • taught in el ^ahar for ao long as ten years. His longest connection with el iiZhar was as socirotary-Oeaeral of the Higher council of that university from 1915 to 1931. It was not to be expeated 9 therefore, that the Grand Ulema would propose him for the vacant rectorship. h. Early in ceceuiber it became generally icnown that the Government proposed to amend the regulations embodied in the above mentioned deoree-law of 1936 with a view to the appoint ment of aheilch Muatapha ^bdel Razek to the vacant liectorahip. a result of this, iihe Vice-Rector of el ^zhar, aheikh viamoun el ^hinnawi, who was appointed to that post by the late Wufd Government €k*rly in 1 44» tendered his resignation to NOkrashi pasha and his example was followed by sheikh Ibrahim Humrouvh t Dean of the faculty of i&gt;niri* Law. 'rhe Vice- Rector* s letter of resignation to the prime fdinister emphasised the impossibility of reconciling the different points of view with regard to the r&amp;Oflage of the Grand ^leaia.* The afdist press played up this resignation, adding its own comment to the effect that the Government's proposal to amend the regulat ions was an unwarranted interference in the affairs of the A^har for political motives. There followed strikes in certain of the Faculties and de aonstrationa of students against the Government, and police were yosted in the precincts of the University to maintain oraer. No serious incidents wore, how ever, reported. 6. a number of petitions were reported to have been submitted to the palace and the Government by sheikhs and students protesting against the proposed legislation. .pnong these was a petition to the palace signed by the Vice-R otor who had just resigned and by sheikh Abdel f^oguid Gelim, the former Grand Mufti. This petition alle ed, according to the pruss, that the Government had sought to bring pressure on the Grand Cleau; to acquiesce in the admission to the jr^opa^e of aheikh ^ustapha Abdel Razek, and made the further ali&amp;ga ‘ ion th.-t* an e dnent foreign personality had intervened with the Prime minister in favour of this .sheikh*s nomination for the rectorship. This latter allegation created a considerable stir and was vigorously exploited by the , v afdist press. The prime Minister was asked in the chamber of Deputies whether this allegation was true; he replied, according to the press, that he had previously been visited by an eminent Moslem personality who had commended sheikh Mustayha A bdel Razee*s academic standing and expressed the hope that the Rector of el ^zhar might be chosen among men of exp rionce so that the Moslem world might collaborate closely with him. It has been generally assumed that the Moslem notable in question is His Highness the Aga Khan. 7. on Deoa^bs* ilth the Governments bill to amend the decree-law of 1936 referred to above was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies as a matter of urgency. The report of tlie Chamber's committee for akfs and Religious Establishments is stated to have emphasised the point that the rectorship re aired, besides culture, a knowledge and experience of administration. in the coarse of discussion for and against the bill, a yaadist deputy who is also an AZharlte 3hel:b pointed out that previous to 1911 the relevant legislation permitted the appointment of rectors from outside whe &gt;oay ol the Grand Ulema. The bill was passed by the chamber by A 33S:) 3 133 votes to 3. 8. In the senate the Opposition secured an adjournment of tho debate for one week on the plea that insufficient time had been allowed for thorough study of the bill. when the debate took place in the senate, Sabry ^bu *laa pasha, for the Opposition, supported the thesis contained in the petition of the outgoing Tice-Reotor and the forxaer Grand mfti which is summarised above. The Minister of Health, on behalf of the Government, denied allegations that Nokrashy pasha had attempted to bargain with the former Grand jui'ti to secure his support for the nomination of sheikh ustapha Abdel hazek to the rector* ship. The minister concluded, according to the press, that the laws of the ^zhar were not sacred, but were, like other in^s, subject to reform &lt; nd amendment. After a watanist senator had opposed the bill as an infringement on the Independence of el jizhar, the senate approved the bill as a whole by 62 votes to 41. 9. a Royal Rescript was then Issued on £7th December appointing Sheikh iustapha Abdel Razek as sector. His eminence was received by King Tarouk and His Majesty is reported to have consented to the sheikh 9 s request to be allowed to relinquish the title of i&amp;sha, which he considered out of keeping with his new religious office. sheikh ] ustapha Abdel Razek has also severed his long connection with the Constitutional*Llberal party, presumably in order to disarm any possible criticism of olitloal partisanship. The reports of the non-wafdist press state that on visiting the tZhar for the first time as Rector on December 29th, Sheikh Mustapha Abdel Razek received a considerable ovation from the ^zharite students. It is also reported that a numerous body of Sheikhs and students proceeded to Abdin palace to thank King F&amp;rouk for the appointment of the new Rector. On this occasion some form of counter-demonstration apparently took place, as a vufdiat newspaper has reported the arrest of three sheikhs belonging to the pro-^afd n ^zharlte Union'. 10. Although it is generally expected that sheikh ‘ustapha xibdel Kazex will encourage a continuation of the process of reform in the Azhur, he is by nature indolent and it remains to be seen to what extent he will succeed in exerting his authority in favour of reform against the possible opposition of the more con servative elements among the Grand uleoa and of those whose hopes of succeeding eventually to the Rectorship or Tioe- Rectorship may have been set back by the broadening of the basis of selection for those offices. I have the honour to be, 4lth the highest respect 8ir, your most obedient, humble Servant, '•#&lt;) killearnAl Azhar 5. With reference to paragraph 6 of Weekly Report No. 15&amp;&gt; the Government’s hill to amend the relevant Decree Law governing the appointment of the Rector of Al Azhar was brought before the Senate on December 17th. According to the press, Sabri Abu Alam Pasha, leader of the Opposition, protested that there had been no time to study the report presented by the Senate’s Corwnittee for Wakfs and Religious Establishments on this measure and he demanded an adjournment for two weeks. After some discussion it was decided to adjourn the debate for one week. 6. This question continues to be the subject of acute partisanship in the Azhar, where further demonstrations and counter-demonstrations are reported to have taken place. The controversy is also the subject of outspoken polemics in the press, the Wafdist press taking the line that the Government’s legislative proposals are an unwarranted interference in the constitution of Al Azhar for political purposes. 7* The press has published details of a petition stated to have been submitted to the Palace by Sheikh Maamoun el-Shinnawi and Sheikh Abdel Neguib Selim, the former Vice- Rector of Al Azhar, who resigned last week, and the former Grand Mufti of Egypt respectively. According to the press reports, the petitioners recall that the body of the Grand Ulema refused by a mjority to admit the validity of Sheikh Abdel Razek’s candidature for the Rectorship when it was first proposed in September last and go on to allege that a high foreign personality had intervened with Nokrashi Pasha at the time in favour of Sheikh Abdel Razek’s nomination. This allegation of foreign intervention raised a considerable stir in the press and was generally assumed to refer to His Highness the Aga Khan. Nokrashi Pasha, however, in reply to a question on cnis point in the Chamber of Deputies on December 18th, stated, according to the press, that when he received the former Vice-Rector and the Imam of the Azhar Mosque on December 8th, he mentioned to them that he had received a visit from an eminent Moslem personality, who had merely remarked that Sheikh Abdel Razek was a notable savant and had expressed the hope that a Rector would be chosen from among men of experience so that the Moslem world could collaborate closely with him. Nokrashi Pasha is stated to have concluded that the former Grand Mufti and the former Vice-Rector had given a distorted account of the interview in question and that the ‘eminent Moslem personality” had not acted in an improper manner. • RECo.
