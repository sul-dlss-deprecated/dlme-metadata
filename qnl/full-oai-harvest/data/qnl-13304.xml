                           A Handbook of Mesopotamia, Corrections and Additions to Volume III: Central Mesopotamia with Southern Kurdistan and the Syrian Desert(Naval Staff Intelligence Department: June, 1918). It supplements Volume III (IOR/L/MIL/17/41/4) which includes routes along the middle Tigris and Euphrates from Baghdad to FellÅ«jeh [Fallujah] up to Mosul and Meskeneh [Maskanah]. The volume was prepared on behalf of the Admiralty and the War Office. These corrections and additions are based partly on information dating from before the Mesopotamian Campaign and partly on intelligence from 1917-1918.The volume contains a note on confidentiality, title page, 'Note', and 'Abbreviations'. There is a page of contents which includes 'Corrections and Additions to Itineraries' for River Routes and Land Routes, 'Corrections and Additions to Gazetteer of Towns', and 'Corrections and Additions to Appendix'. Several pages have been left blank for convenience of use with interleaved copies of the original edition.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Tigris River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Euphrates River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mosul</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lesser Zab (river)</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Syrian Desert</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Maskanah</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023045524.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
