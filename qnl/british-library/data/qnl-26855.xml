My Lord, Tehran, July 8, 1938 I HAVE received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad a copy ot his despatch to you, No. 274 of the 22nd June, recording remarks by the Iiaqi ' Minister for Foreign Affairs on certain affairs concerning Iran. I would venture to offer the following comments on the points therein raised. 2. As regards purchases of arms from Czechoslovakia, I understand that fifty batteries of 105 mm. Skoda guns (four guns to each battery) were ordered in i.937. Thirty-eight batteries have been delivered so far, and the remainder aie expected before the end of the year. I am informed that the Iranian military authorities are purchasing Hungarian draught horses to equip these batteries. 3. In the third and fourth paragraphs of his despatch Sir Maurice Peterson mentions an incident on the boundary between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Iran. I received a report of rumours of such an incident from the acting British consul at Tabriz in March last, but at the time it proved impossible to confirm them. At the time it appeared that such an incident, it it had occurred, was probably connected with the recent expulsions ot Iranian subjects from Soviet territory, on which I had the honour to report to your Lordship in my despatch No. 221 of the 14th June. There ha\e subsequent y been reports, which again I have been unable so far to confirm, ot an increase in Russian fortifications on this border. r&lt;- at • ta ^ 4 As regards, in particular, paragraph 4 of Sir Maurice Peterson s despatch, it should be noted that the 4th Division of the Iranian army (the Eastern Azerbaijan Division) is permanently, stationed m that locality; the 2nd Division is in Tehran, and has not moved. . . ^ 5 Taufiq Suwaidi mentioned to His Majesty s Ambassador that, according to his information, the Soviet Government disliked the Saadabad Pact, in conversation with me a few days ago. the counsellor to the Soviet Embassy maintained, however, as he did last year, that his Government regarded the pact as involving some measure of “ assamissement in the Middle East, and therefore as something on the whole to be welcomed . 6 It is correct that General Gendre, of the French Military Mission, who has temporarily been appointed adviser on frontier defences, has recently visited the frontier, as Taufiq Suwaidi said (please see the last sentence of paragraph 5 in Sir M Peterson’s despatch). General Gendre has made a tour ot all lian s frontiers including that with India in Baluchistan; he gave me to understand that the Azerbaijan visit was more or less of a routine nature, enquiung laughingly whether war was expected there. „ .... 8 7 Mr. MacDougall, adviser to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, was recently here on leave; he left to visit Tabriz where he was to stay with His MaiestVs consul His intention was to proceed to Tiflis. for which journey he Sed a visa from the Soviet Embassy here.

Peterson to Viscount Halifax.—(Received July 4.) (No. 274.) My Lord, Bagdad, June 22, 1938. I HAVE the honour to report that on the 21st June, during the course of my weekly interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Excellency spoke to me about the news which he had recently been receiving from Iran. 2. He mentioned first the rearming of the Persian army, and told me that he had reliable information that the Persians had purchased from Czechoslovakia fifty batteries of field and fifty batteries of mountain guns (he did not know how many guns there were to each battery). This information has caused some alarm to the Iraqi General Staff and had increased their desire to strengthen their own artillery without delay. 3. He went on to say that he had received a number of reports from the Iraqi consul at Tabriz which indicated that relations between Iran and Soviet Russia were becoming strained. According to these reports the trouble had started &lt; about a deal in cattle. In fulfilment \of their trade agreements, the Persians had gathered for delivery to the Soviel Government large herds of cattle at some point close to the Azerbaijan frontier. There had, however, been some hitch in settling the details of the transaction and the Persians had delayed the handing over of the herds. Thereupon Soviet troops had actually crossed the frontier and carried off the cattle from Persian territory. 4. After this incident the Persian troops in Azerbaijan had been reinforced and two divisions, the second and the fourth, with a total strength of over 5,000 men, were now concentrated in the province. 5. Taufiq Suwaidi went on to explain that, according to his information, the Soviet Government disliked the Saadabad Pact and were bringing considerable pressure to bear on the Persian Government to withdraw from it. He had further evidence of the serious attention which the Persian Government were giving to the possibility of trouble with the Soviet Government. Quite recently a party of Persian staff officers, accompanied by a French general, had carried out an extensive tour of the north-western provinces of Iran with the intention of preparing a defence plan against a Russian invasion. 6. He had questioned the Persian Minister in Bagdad on this subject, but the Minister had been evasive and was probably not well informed about the situation. 7. I said that I had no information to confirm these reports of the Iraqi consul in Tabriz, but prima facie it seemed to me improbable that the Soviet Government would wish to become entangled in difficulties with Iran as they were bound to devote their attention to the complex situation in Central Europe and in the Far East. 8. I then asked how the Minister now found the relations of his own Govern ment with the Persian Government. He said that, during the last few weeks, they had outwardly improved, but that feelings of real confidence and sympathy had not yet been established. He thought, however, that the Shah had recently given orders that care should be taken to avoid difficulties developing between the two countries. 9. He concluded by telling me that the Iraqi Minister at Tehran would be coming to Iraq soon on leave prior to retiring. A successor would be appointed in the autumn who would also be accredited to Kabul. 10. The Persian Prime Minister is stopping for a day or two in Bagdad on his way back from Egypt, arriving on the 26th June. 11. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran. [364 d—1] I have, &amp;e.

Colonel Pybus had previously discussed with me the two points which he put before Doctor Naji-el-Asil, and in speaking as he did, he had my full concurrence. Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No. 118 and to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad No. 46. I have the honour to be with the highest respect., Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sgd.) H.J. Seymour. I am sending copies of this despatch to the The Right Honourable Anthony Eden M.C., M.P., e tc. , etc., etc., THE FOREIGN OFFICE.I renewed my acquaintance with Doctor Naji el Asil at the Iraqi reception on July 5th. I asked him to spare me a few minutes as there were two matters about which I wanted to talk to him. By way of a sighting shot I congratulated him on his appointment and said it did not surprise me as I never thought that Counsellor in Tehran would he the culminating point in his career. This having produced quite an audible purr, I went on to suggest that the Iraqis should appoint a military attach^ to Iran. The advantages, as I saw them, were:- (i) The present close and friendly relations between Iraq and Iran called for such an appointment. (ii) The presence of an Iraqi military attachd might, conceivably, facilitate the settlement of those frontier disputes in which encroachments and high handed actions by small parties of troops were alleged to be the cause as opposed to those which arose out of the marauding habits of tribesmen or acts of brigandage. (iii) The presence of an Iraqi Military attach^ in Tehran might better the lot of the rest of the fraternity. At present, as Doctor Naji doubtless knew, the Turkish military attachd was taken everywhere and shewn everything, while the remaining military attaches were treated as social lepers. If an Iraqi were appointed the Iranians would be bound to accord him equal treatment with the Turk and might even eventually extend this favoured treatment to the remainder. If they did the former and not the latter, there was still the advantage that I should have two well-informed sources to draw on instead of one. ( iv) The Iraqi Government would find the military attach^ useful in calming the (apparently) shattered nerves of their politicianspoliticians and allaying their fears of Iranian aggression by authoritative denials of those all too frequent and all too stupid rumours that three divisions of Iranian troops, were massed here with bellicose intentions or that 100 aeroplanes were drawn up in readiness elsewhere for a bombing raid on Baghdad. At present it fell to my lot to receive and deny these fantastic stories and occasionally to receive requests for information concerning communications to the frontier and the location and numbers of Iranian troops there. Though I was, of course, always ready to help, I did not relish the idea of incurring additional suspicion by acting as honorary military attach^ to Iraq. These reasons seemed to impress him and he said he agreed with me as to the advisability of the appointment but foresaw a difficulty in providing a suitable officer. I replied that surely in the whole of the Iraq army a suitable officer could be found possessed of some tact, and a working knowledge of French and Persian. Had he, I said, brought up another objection, I could have understood it, namely that three years ago when his Minister in Tehran had proposed the appointment he had been told by Monsieur Kazemi that it was not necessary and would not be welcome. If, therefore, the Iraqi Government did not wish to incur the risk of a second rebuff I could well understand it. Doctor Naji said that he remembered the occasion but had no fears on that score now as, after all the protestations of brotherly love which the Iranians had made in the past week, they could not decently maintain Monsieur Kazemi f s attitude. He promised to take the matter up with the Minister of Defence on his return. The other matter I wanted to mention was, I said, that of frontier commissars. Did the Iraqis find the system satisfactory ?s satisfactory ? The Government of India had disliked the idea hut the Iranian Government would doubtless try to bring it up again and if they could say that the Governments of Russia, Turkey, Iraq and Afghanistan all liked the scheme, it would be more difficult for the Government of India to turn it down. Dr. Naji said that it had not worked well and the Iraqis did not term their officials frontier commissars’; they were called ’’mutasarrifs” and if the Iranian Government persisted in calling them frontier commissars, it did not worry him unduly. I said that we v/ere, I think, talking at cross purposes and that what I meant was how did his Government like the idea of their consuls being short-circuited in the matter of frontier incidents as ours v/ere in East Persia. The Iranian Government would not allow their frontier officials to notify our consuls of such incidents. These consuls were in touch with British officials on the Indian side of the frontier and could often effect speedy settlement of minor acts of theft of, say, a camel. In spite of this the Iranian Government preferred to refer the complaint through the circuitous channel of Tehran-London, or even Geneva, by which time the stolen camel had probably died of old age. Doctor Naji laughed heartily and said he entirely agreed and was going to say more when the Minister of Foreign Affairs came up. I Judged it expedient to terminate the conversation then. (Sgd.)
