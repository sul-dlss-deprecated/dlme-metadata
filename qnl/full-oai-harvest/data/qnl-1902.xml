An addition foliation sequence is also present between ff 4-44; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence concerning a request made by Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī, the ruler of Qatar, to allow his son, ‘Alī bin ‘Abdullāh Āl Thānī, to enter Bahrain in order to be admitted in to the American Mission Hospital for medical treatment.This request - to which Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah, the ruler of Bahrain objected - came in the context of tensions between Qatar and Bahrain over ownership of Zubarah situated on the Qatari peninsula.The file contains a number of letters in Arabic sent from Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah, to Tom Hickinbotham, Britain's Political Agent in Bahrain.The file also contains a copy of an agreement from 24 June 1944 signed by Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah of Bahrain and Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī of Qatar in order to restore friendly relations between the two states (folio 28).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Qatar 'Alī bin 'Abdullāh Āl Thanī</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003ad#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003ad#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
