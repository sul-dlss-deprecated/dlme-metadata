It is of the greatest importance that no country craft should leave Bahrain without the Quarantine Medical Officer’s certificate, and I hope that Your Excellency will issue the same orders in this connection as on previous occasions. All'persons who intend to depart from Bahrain either by steamer or sailing boat should be warned to present themselves for inspection by the Quarantine Medical Officer at the Agency Hospital $ between the hours Customs House of 7.00 A.M.&amp; 9.00 A.M. and 3.00 P.M.. and 4.00 P.M.

He should be asked to order that the roofs should be taken off the bazaars as they were this year (19 17) in Manamah - 'if the measure can be extended to Muharraq so much the better. 2 . It is very difficult to get statistics of the number of deaths, and it is out of question to get orders issued for HI deaths to be reported, nor, if issued, would they be obeyed. It might be possible to pay a man to watch each of the four, chief burial places and report the burials - though even then ; figures would be extremely inaccurate as the buriers will not usually admit that their corpse died of plague. Still the scheme / is worth a trial. A printed notice has been drawn up giving briefly causes and methods of prevention of plague. This should be widely circulated.tCByah \ Otkcr'?***'* &lt;ft from the Deputy Political Resident, tSusbtre to the Political Agent, Bahrain. declared plague infected. 10.
