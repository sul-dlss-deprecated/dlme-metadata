The work of our Basra Branch is chiefly on account of the Government of India and requires a staff of six Europeans, including the Manager and an experienced Accountant. 5. The Government business is almost entirely in cash and the counting in and out of small notes and rupee coins is v/ork necessitating the greatest care and supervision. 6. The climate of Basra is, as you are well aware, one of the worst in the world and some members of our European staff are generally in hospital. 7. Under present conditions it is most difficult to main tain a sufficient staff in Basra to ensure the work being con ducted with efficiency. We have depleted our European staff in India by transfers to Basra to an irreducible minimum and we have no other source of supply but to recruit from this country. 8. The passport application we ask you to support in favour of Mr. Prank Verran Thomas would enable that gentleman to proceed to Bombay where he would relieve one of our more exper ienced assistants for Basra. 9. Mr. Thomas has been rejected for the Army five times and our Doctor reports that one of his eyes is useless. His classification is BII and he is in possession of a Certificate exempting him from military service so long as he remains in his present employment.

Under instructions from their Directors, Eastern Bank of Basrah have applied for permission to open branch of their bank at Bahrain forthwith and enquire what arrangements Government would make and what assistance they would give. I am strongly of opinion, on commercial and political grounds, that bank should be encouraged to open at Bahrain at once and that we should undertake to give them custody of such Government monies as there are there and, in addi- tiom undertake (1) to obtain consent of Shaikh to their establishment (2) to give them facilities for shipping, by Government vessels rupees free of freight, (subject to any fees leviable by Captain of ship under Marine or Naval Regulations) when this can be done without additional expense to the State. This latter provision necessarily conflicts with British India Steam Navigation Company’s petty financial interests who consider it to their interests to get as much as they can out of freight on specie from Bahrain. The Company’s high freights on specie and present monopoly of regular shipping facilities are detrimental to our commercial and therefore to our political interests, and I am of the very strong opinion that we should do all in our power to make the bank independent in this matter of the company.

That we keep the accounts of the Government of India in Basra free of commission. 2. That the Government of India keep with our Basra Branch free of interest a balance of between the equivalent of £35,000/- and £65,000/- it being understood that the balance will not fall below the equivalent of £35 ,000/-. 3. That Government securities (not necessarily British) ^gI5l •/''x be lodged by this Bank with the Bank of England or your nominee the value of £20,000/-. 4. That the Government of India provide our office in Basra with a Military Guard free of cost to the Bank.-'•HI 5, Tlae Agreement te te in force for one year, after whicft termina*ble at six Iaontils , notice on either side^ It is estimated that Government payments in Baera will he about the equivalent ©f £62 t 0QQ/+ monthly and the receipts £28 ,000/- monthly and that rupees will be shipped from Bombay for credit of the Government. Should we be asked to remit funds for the Government our out-of-pocket expenses plus ^ commission on the amounts so remitted will be paid to us. If in twelve months f time we are able to show that the conduct of the Government Accounts has resulted in a direct loss to the Bank It Is understood that you will be prepared to consider favourably an adjustment of the above mentioned terms* I shall be glad if you Will confirm the arrangement arid conditions as set out herein.

Hie bank to receive^and account for, Government dues locally collected and money sent from India; and to pay all withdrawals by the military and civil authorities. The local receipts on Government account may be expected to be about £28,000 a month; and the payments about £62,000 a month; the difference being made up by remittances from India. The balance at the credit of the Government is not likely to be at any time less than £35,000 and may rise at times to about £65,000. The Military authorities may be expected to require about fifty disbursements a day. In addition to the amounts and transactions mentioned above, regimental funds and institutions will deposit money with the bank; but the amount cannot be estimated now. Security ^and.Ileiauiieration . The bank have agreed to lodge security (letter of the 7th June). High class miscellaneous securities for, say, £20,000 would seem to be enough. As regards remuneration: No payment would seem to be called for in respect of the ordinary business of payments and receipts, since the use of the balances that the Government expects to retain would appear to provide sufficient remun eration; but, in the event of the Government requiring the bank to make remittances for it between Basra and India (or England), the payment might be:- Hien coin or specie has to be moved . The out of pocket expenses and i per cent. In other cases (i.e. where movement of coin or specie is not required) . One-eighth per cent. It does not seem probable that the Government willwill require the bank to make either kind of remittance; out the above provisions are suggested to provide for the possibility. Pur at i o n ..o f te r e ement . It is proposed that the agreement should be terminable at 6 months’ notice on either side but that such notice be not given until one year from its commencement, unless justified or required by a change in political circumstances. It may be mentioned that some years ago the Imperial Bank of Persia at the request of the Government opened a branch at Nasratabad in Seistan, finding its own capital; and received a subsidy of £1500 a year. The working expenses of the Branch varied between £1500 and £2000 a year. These figures suggest that, in a place like Basra, so much more likely to afford good banking business, the free use by a branch bank of Government capita.! fluctuating between £35,000 and £65,000 ought to be sufficient remuneration for ordinary banking services rendered to the Government.TELEGRAPHIC ADDRESS: “PEHLEVI, LONDON' Sir;, I would respectfully sutmlt the Bank's application to he permitted to keep the account of the Indian Government at/ our Busreh Agency.

HirtzePs letter of the 12th instant, I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council that there are no general regulations applicable to arrangements with Banks employed to do the business of the Imperial Govern ment in Colonies and Protectorates. The only business in respect of which Banks in Colonies are regularly employed on behalf of this ^lart- ment is the business of the 'Treasury Chests' abroad i.e. the business of raising and supplying funds for the public service at 9 stations, vizt. Bermuda, Ceylon, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Malta, Mauritius, Bouth Africa, and the Straits Settlements. In the case of the agreements with Banks for the conduct of the business of these Chests it is not the practice,of this Department to require the Bank# to deposit security, as it is found possible to make agreements with Banks of known standing from v/hom it is not thought neces sary to ask for such deposit|. The remuneration of the anks selected for this class of business is determined by local conditions, but where possible tenders are invited from The Under Secretary of State, India Office.1 fi’om a. limited number of banks of good credit, which are in a position to undertake the business, and the most favourable tender is accepted. The Banks do not usually require any commission or other remuneration beyond the use of balances, and in most cases they agree to pay interest at a moderate rate on the minimum monthly balances. The Secretary of State may perhaps find it of advantage to consult the Secretary of State for the Cojonies. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Communications on this subject PPu?oSIIIGr should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W., P Downing Street, June, 191b I am directed by Mr.Secretary Bonar Law to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (P/2104) of the 12th June, enquiring as to the arrangements regarding the security and remuneration which are business in the,Colonies not possessing responsible government and Protectorate^ 2 . I am to request that you will inform Mr.Secretary Chamberlain that the terms of any such ar rangement which may from time to time be made are frequently settled locally, and that Mr. Bonar Law fears he cannot furnish very full or complete information on this subject. 3. In the best African Colonies the remunera tion granted to the Bank of British west Africa, Limited, consists of commissions in respect of certain remittances, and, in some cases, a commission on the turnover of G-ovemment money. The G-ovemment also at present provides the Bonk with the necessary guards free of charge and in some cases allows free conveyance of specie on Government railways. usually made with Banks employed to do Government 4 - • THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE, INDIA OFFICE.\ \ istf » o ^'ip.mnrgJiduin 4. Ab an example of the arrangements, I am to enclose a memorandum prepared by the Treasurer of Nigeria, dated September last, explaining the terms on which, in Nigeria, Government accounts were kept and Government money held by the Bank of British West Africa. It should be added that it is understood that the rites for homeward remittances have now been altered in favour of the Bank, owing to an increase in the rate charged by the West African Currency Board for drafts on London. 5. In the Eastern and West Indian Colonies, the Banks are, it is understood, little employed by Government except as places of deposit for Government balances and other remittances. It is possible that W' -&lt; in some of the West Indian Colonies a local Bank may discharge the duties of the cashier’s Department of the Colonial Paymaster. 6. Although it is not the practice in the- West Indian Colonies to take security from Banks of recognised standing it is understood that security has occasionally been taken from small local Banks in respect of Government deposits or accounts, but the terms of any arrangements made for this purpose are not known in this Office. A small subsidy has from time to time been granted to a Bank with a view to inducing the Bank to maintain a Branch in an island where banking operations would not otherwise be remunerative. ,. \ 7.

It is very desirable to gmt rid of as many vexa tious conditions and exceptions as possible, and after dis cussing th vf hol. question Uth TU Light he agrees to re- re com lend the following changes for the approval of his Directors: The Bank to discontinue the charge of f10 p.a, at (5), f-5 p.a. at (6), 1/16m corrUnsion at (11) and J12), and 1/8/ commission at (IB), thus abolishing all charges for keeping Government or Railway Accounts throughout Higer 1 a, inxchange for free railway carriage of specie in any on year from Baric to Bukuru, (or railhead if short of Bukuru), up to amount ofof Government deposits at Saria in the same year. Item (S) of paragraph 2 (a), with its orre sponding condition to he deleted. TJie loss to Government on the free Railway car- riage of speoio from Zaria to Rukuru should not exceed £S27. *Ihe saving to Government on items (5) £10, (6) (11) £60, (13) £06 and {13) £350, is estimated at £361. 5. The question of the Bank cashing cheques drawn on one Branch at any other Branch which the Government may choose has been raised but this they will not consent to do. They are quite willing to cash cheques on Tano, Z&amp;ria, Zungeru, Lokoja, Ibadan, Abeokuta, Forcados, Onitsha, Warri, Calabar and Port liar court at Lagos, fra©; but they can scarcely be expected to cash cheques in the opposite direction for nothing* 6. It has been customary for Government to supply free Guards at nearly all the Bank’s Branches. The Com mittee wore of opinion that except in the case of Lagos the Ban); should pay for these. Mr Light assures me that the Bank does not pay for Guards in any other West African Colony and he does not think it should be asked to pay for them in Migeria. 7. If my opinion is dosired it is as follows;— (1) The mutual coneescions mentioned in para graph 4 above seem to be reasonable and may be accepted by the Government if the Directors agree to them. (2) The free Guards .might be continued, in the meantime at any rate. Higeria need not be loss liberal than other West African Colonics in this respect. (3) The agreement of 17th September, 1912, could be terminated without injury to Government: it is unnecessary. A letter detailing the new conditions and a x*ep!y accepting them Is all that is needed. Modifica tions** tj tions can be discussed from time to time as the necessi ty for them arises. 8. Mr.Light assures me that 'no private firm receives better terms than the Government and very few receive as good'. I am aloe as mired by Mr.Light and by Mr.Buchan (who has just arrived in Lagos) that the rate for cable transfers to London is 1/8* less to Government than to any other of the Bank*8 customers. 9. ’There are two other points. The Bank does not allow any intersot on the Government 1 ® minimum daily balances and it does not sail Telegraphic transfers be low par. ' think I am right in stating that in some other Colonies the Bank does both. X mentioned these points to Mr.Light but he would not entertain either of them. 10. I do not think it wotild be Jti&amp;iolous to press the question of interest on the minimum daily balances* for after all it is doubtful if the Bank (directly) makes much out of the Government deposits; but the ques tion of the cost of remittances is on a different foot- ing and might be raised later when the war is over and business has resumed its normal course again. It is true that it Is a convenience to Govern ment to remit through the Bank instead of through private firms but at the same time it is also a source of very considerable profit to the Bank* Should the Government not receive a portion of this profit (as they frequently do in Ceylon for example) in the shape of remittances below part Further experience of local conditions may cause mo to modify my opinion one way or the other but at present X am not convinced that the Government should not obtain better remitting terms - at some seasons of the5 the year at any rate, (Sgd) D, S,MAGG-REGOR treasurer.

We have decided that Eastern Bank should he invited to open a branch at Basra and we should be grateful if your Lordship could arrange to have terms settled with the Bank’s head office in London. It is understood, generally speaking, business with Government would be, firstly, banking monies remitted by Government for the payment of contracts and salaries ; and secondly, receiving and accounting Government dues payable in occupied area. Branches of civil administration of the Commissioners’ Revenue and other civil branches with incomes would deposit receipts and draw on Bank for their expenditure, and Field Controller, Military Accounts Department, would get an assignment placed to his account and draw on it whenever necessary. Regimental messes and institutions woidd use Bank in the ordinary way. Very large sums woidd thus pass through Bank’s hands and there would be always huge standing surplus. We are of opinion that use of these sums should be sufficient inducement to Bank to undertake Govern ment business on nominal terms.
