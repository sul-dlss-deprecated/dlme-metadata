It notes the efforts the Acting Resident has made to recover the debts of the Shaik Abdel Russool [Shaikh ‘Abd al-Rasūl Khān], but explains that these have failed and that recovering the money is unlikely. The letter also mentions that Mahomed Hossain Khan [Muḥammad Ḥusayn Khān] supplied some evidence for a claim to part of his late father's pension.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x000071#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
