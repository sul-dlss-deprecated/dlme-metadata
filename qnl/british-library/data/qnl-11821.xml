(JJ CHAPTER I. History. Tho following briof sketch of the more salient features of the Rccrnt Poli- political history of Persia during the past few years will help to explain the present situation in that country. By the beginning of the present century, the condition of Persia, which for some years had been giving cause for grave anxiety, had grown quite intolerable. The Shah, Muzaffar-ud-din, was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers, who were living on tho spoils of the Government and country. He had parted with the treasures inherited from his father and with most of the imperial and national domains. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans, the proceeds of which he had spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his favourites. There was a yearly deficit and the debt of the country was growing • daily. Disturbances broke out everywhere, and the popular discontent was not appeased until the Shah, in August 1906, had signed a decree granting constitutioral Government to the people. A Majlis or National Assembly of 162 representatives of all classes, elected by their peers, met in October of that year. A few days later Muzaffar- ud-Din died. The new Shah, Muhammad Ali, adopted a reactionary policy and made every endeavour to crush the N ationalist movement. Insurrections broke out in'the principal cities and finally in 1909 the Shah abdicated his throne, being succeeded by his son, Ahmad Mirza, a boy of 12 years old. The ex-Shah retired to Russia, a pension being allowed him by the Persian Government. There was, however, no improvement in the state of Persia and fresh disturbances broke out every where, notably in Pars. During 1911-12-12 several attempts were made by the ex-Shah and his brother, Salar-ud-Douleh, to overthrow tho existing Government. These all ended in failure. These MC37CGS B2 disturbances, however, coupled with the attitude adopted by Russia who, by the end of 1913, had on one pretext and another sent some 14,000 troops into Northern Persia, had brought Persia to the verge of ruin. Her treasury was empty, she had no military forces available to suppress disorders or to collect revenue, and there was no strong public man to be found to direct efforts to reform. Most of her troubles were ascribed to Russia, which had consistently thwarted every effort at reform ; but Great Britain also incurred much odium for connivance. During the Great War, Turkish troops and German agents intcred Persia in order to cause further difficulties for the British Government. Their efforts were successful to a ceitain extent and they had the effect of still further increasing the difficulties of the Persian Government. An additional danger arose early in 1920 from the advance of the Bolsheviks to the borders of the former Tsarist Empire in Trans-Caucasia and Turkistan. Their arrival there was a signal f or an attempt to get Bolshevik agents into Persia, and for the commencement of a violent anti-Persian campaign in the Bolshevik press. The general tenor of this campaign was that a revolution must be caused in Persia to get rid of the Shah and that, if the Persians themselves could not initiate such a revolution, the Bolsheviks would invade the country and bring it about themselves. On the excuse of capturing the Volunteer Caspian fleet which was interned at Enzeli, the Bolsheviks, in May 1920, landed troops at that port, got into touch with Kuchik Khan and the local Persian revolutionaries and com menced an advance on Tehran. The Persian forces, backed as they were by British troops, checked this advance but were unable to drive out the Russians altogether. •Under the Anglo-Persian Agreement, concluded in 1919, the British Government had offered to loan to the Persians, the sum of two million pounds sterling and to reorgani/e the Persian Army and finances. A military mission, as also a financial adviser and staff, were sent to Tehran to report on the require ments of Persia in accordance with the terms of this agreement. But the Persian Government were from the start only half hearted about the agreement, and put obstacle after obstacle in the way of its ratification. tia 1 to \ ces; Leg The Sar sior insl org He Rm Din Ru: and Cal moi cou the Mir and can ordi Rm thus i war inveEarly in 1920, the Persian Government commenced to nego tiate a treaty with the Bolsheviks by which tiie latter agreed to withdraw their troops from Persia and to grant generous con cessions to her in return for permission to establish a Bolshevik Legation at Tehran and Consulates in all the chief Persian towns. The treaty was signed in February and shortly after its signature Saiyid Zia-ud-Din with the help of the Persian Cossack Divi sion overthrew the Government at Tehran, and set to work to institute reforms of a sweeping nature* which included the re organization of the Army and finances under British advisers. He also annulled the Anglo-Persian Agreement and upheld the Rusfeo-Persian treaty. Jealousy and intrigue caused Zia-ud- Din’s fall in May, and this gave a handle to the newly arrived Russian Minister to start an anti-British campaign in the capital and to advance the Bolshevik cause in Northern Persia. The Cabinet which followed that of Zia-ud-Din has come more and more under Russian influence, and at the present time the country is being exploited by Russia owing to the inability of the weak and corrupt leaders to break the spell the Russian Minister has cast over them. The national finances are chaotic, and the future appears to be far from hopeful unless Persia can break away from her present position and set her house in order with the advice and assistance of some power other than Russia. In 1856 the Persian Government besieged and seized Herat, Military thus breaking its engagements with the British Government. ^ngk?' „ _ T , , , Persian Un November 1st, the Governor-General of India declared War, war against Persia for breaking agreement and seizing Herat. lbu6 ' 57 ' Two courses were open to the Government of India for the invasion of Persia, ( 1 ) To march across Afghanistan. This would have been difficult and expensive, would have irritated the Af ghans, and probably have brought on another Afghan war. (2) To send an expedition by sea to the head of the Persian Gulf, and thence to carry out direct operations against the interior. The latter alternative was adopted. On November 1 1 th, the first troops left Bombay. * b2Tho expeditionary force embarked at Bombay, Karachi and two smaller ports, in sailing vessels (towed by steamers) under the command of Major-General Stalker. Total strength, 5,670 fighting men (of whom 2,270 were Europeans), 3,750 followers, 1,150 horses, 430 bullocks. On November 26th. the fleet (8 Indian Navy steamers, 7 steam and 30 sailing transports) assembled at Qishm. Here it was discovered that the doolies and bearers had been left behind. Great confusion prevailed owing to the transports anchoring indiscriminately, ships carrying different arms were all huddled together, and the brigadiers were quite unable to exercise their commands. On December 3rd, the island of Kharag was occupied. On December 7th, the force disembarked at Halileh Bay, 12 miles south east of Bushire. This place was selected because the water there was good, landing easy, and no defences existed 1 here is a good landing beach at Bushire, but it is under lire The disembarkation took two days, a strong north-west breeze having caused delay. The operation was covered bv the lire of gun boats, which drove the enemy out of the date planta- iy uai-rieu out. me fleet at from the walls. This was imperfect- nevpr i_ , , 1 I IThe sanitary state of Bushire was found to be bad. The troops encamped one mile outside the walls near the water supply, a cavalry out-post with guns being posted two miles fur ther on towards the hills. The want of sufficient boats to land stores from the fleet was badly felt. The inhabitants brought in supplies and were well pleased to receive ready money pay ments, after their previous experience of Persian troops. 1 he enemy had collected troops at Shiraz and were report ed to be at Parashband and advancing to Kalimeh. They had brought a considerable artillery train bv a circuitous route, some 18 pounders coming by FIruzabad, and had established two supply depots, one at Chahkutah, 20 miles distant, the other at Borazjun, 45 miles. Their chief transport was small hardy donkeys. General Sir James Outram with the 2nd Division of the expedition, consisting of the 14th Light Dragoons, the Scinde Horse, l Troop Royal Horse Artillery, two field batteries, 78th Highlanders, 2 'rd and 26th Bombay Native Infantry and a composite battalion consisting of 10 light companies of native infantry, left India in the latter half of December, reaching Bushire at the end of January, Chahkutah was first destroyed by a cavalry force. As the enemy were cutting off supplies from Bushire, an advance on Borazjun was then decided on. On February 3rd, General Outram left Bushire, taking 3 battalions British infantry, 3 battalions native infantry, 3rd Bombay Cavalry, Poona Irregular Cavalry and horse and field artillery, total 419 cavalry, 18 guns, 118 sappers and 4,116 infantry. Practically no transport was available. No tents weie taken and each man carried a great coat and blanket and two days’ cooked provisions. The commissariat arranged for bringing on reserve rations. The march was made by night, bitterly cold at this time of year. After 26 miles the force halte I for the day. Severe dust-storms followed by hail and rain, which drenched every one, and a cold piercing wind made the march very trying. Borazjun was reached after another trying march, and*a night of cold and rain, the force having covered 46 miles in 41 hours. The depot was taken after a slight skirmish with the enemy’s cavalrv, the entrenchments being quite insignificantf) Battle of Klifishab, r I'he village close by might have been utilized as a formid able defensive work, having high walls, towers and a ditch 15 feet deep ; while all round it were cactus and thorn fences. All th? ammunition and everything else that could no. be carried off was destroyed. . xrej On February 7th, provisions w ere running short., and a retire ment oft Bushire was commenced by a night march. About mid night the guide lost his way, and the enemy attacked. The troops coolly formed up and lay down under lire till dawn, losing, how- ever, two officers and six men wounded and one man killed. On February 8 th, when day broke, the enemy were seen drawn up with their right on Khushab and numbering 6,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry and 15 guns. They were attacked by the cavalry and artillery, the infantry being in support. The artillery made very line practice and the Persians broke and lied. The 3rd Bombay Cavalry charged and broke up a square of Persian infantry Continuous rain now set in. The force resumed its march that evening. The country had become a swamp, and the roads were almost impassable, ankle deep in sticky mud, half clay, half sand, and many men lost their boots. The guides misled the force which marched throughout the entire night. The infantry reached Bushire on the evening of February 9th : heavy rain was still falling, but the men were in excellent spirits. Successful operations were then undertaken against Muham- mareh nnd Ahwaz, the war coming to an end with the treaty of Paris signed on March 4th 1857. The conditions of peace were—The Shah to withdraw his troops from Herat, relinquishing every claim of sovereignty over it, and to refrain from all interference with Afghanistan ; to recognise the independence of Herat; prisoners taken at Herat to be released without ransom. The British Mission to be received at Tehran with apologies; the slave trade to be suppressed m the 1 email Gulf and apologies to be made to Mr. Murray for the insolent conduct of the Shah and his minister. In May the troops were withdrawn from Muhammareh to Busnire or inuia the tov alsi hea dal con win of f was trai on tha res( Has Boi wit ed exc of 1 of on lad me 39t of t offi Coi litt ing of 1 ped Th. ord Isfi ini]Bushire was occupied till October, pending the carrying out of the conditions of peace. During the occupation of Bushire, the inhabitants of the Personal town and surrounding districts were quite friendly. This was also the case at Muhammareh. At Bushire the troops were dition. healthy. There was a great scarcity of forage and fuel. Chagha- dak, 13 miles off, was suggested as more sanitary. Great dis comfort was experienced from the prevailing strong north-west winds, which blew the whole day regularly, raising dense clouds of fine penetrating sand. The only way to mitigate the nuisance was to build mud walls round the tents. The force appears to have been very badly provided with transport. It must have relied for transport and its gear on what was obtainable in the country, but came to the opinion that no hostile force landing can confidently count on local resources. It succeeded in purchasing 2,500 camels in Basra and some 8,000 mules in Baghdad. A simple boring apparatus for sinking wells was recommended. Landing operations were generally difficult in the Gulf. Bombay bandar boats were found very useful for this. The recent history of Fars has been one of incessant disorder * ur!, • vith lawlessness at a premium. Governor-General has follow ed Governor-General in rapid succession, but up to the present, except during the existence of the South Persia Bifles, not one of them has really been able to cope with the administration of this backward and lawless province. In 1911 robberies on the Shiraz-Bushire road reached their height, even an English lady doctor being severely maltreated. The British Govern ment was obliged to strengthen the Consular Guards and the 39th Central India Horse were set to Shiraz. In the autumn of the same year the formation of a Gendarmerie under Swedish officers was commenced. In December the escort of the British Consul was attacked and he himself wounded. 1912 brought little relief to the situation, the 39th Central India Horse remain ing virtual prisoners in Shiraz. In December Captain Eckford of that regiment was shot by raiders while on a shooting ex pedition. In 1913 the cavalry were withdrawn from Shiraz. The Gendarmerie gradually improved and by the end of 1914 order had been completely restored on the Bushire-Shlraz- Isfahan road, while the security of other roads had greatly improved. The outbreak of the war and German intrigues.leading to the defection of the Gendarmerie,’threw matters back and the province once more relapsed into a state of anarchy. In 1015 Wassmuss, a German propagandist, was actively working among the tribes of South Persia and eventually inspired the Tangistanls to open violence. In August 1915, they made several raids on the outskirts of Bushire. The following month a force consisting of two Indian infantry regiments, a squadron of cavalry and a mountain battery under the command of Bri gadier-General Brooking, supported by two of His Majesty’s men of war, undertook punitive measures against them, even tually dispersing them and breaking their resistance in Septem ber of that year. In November 1915 the British Consul and colony at Shiraz were arrested by certain rebellious Khans assisted by the Gen darmerie and were not finally released till August 1916. In the latter year the organization of a force termed the South Persia Rifles under Sir Percy Sykes was commenced, the latter with Lieutenant-Colonel Gough, the new Consul for Shiraz, reaching that place in November. In December a rising took place at Kazarun, the rebels driving back a smaH’force sent against them by Sir Percy Sykes. Through the intervention of Soulat-ud-I)ouleh the chief of the Qashqai tribe, matters were temporarily patched up. but no punishment was ever inflicted on the Kazarunis for their rebel lious behaviour. During the rest of 1917 and early part of 1918 the South Persia Rifles was busily engaged in dealing with the Arab and other robber tribes, several of whom were taught a severe lesson. During all this time the attitude of the Soulat continued doubtful and unsatisfactory, till finally in May 1918 he openly showed his hand and declared war avainst the British and the South Persia Rifles. A severe defeat was inflicted on his forces near Khaneh Khabls after which the British troops fcl back on Shiraz, which place was shortly afterwards practi- ca y nn ested. Most of the South Persia Rifles, however, in Shiraz remained staunch, whilst the Qawam and the Governor- General co-operated loyally with our troops. Severe defeats were inflated upon the rebels who ultimately broke and fled. 1 tie Soulat was deposed from Ids Ilkhamship of the Qashqai phice ^ la ^ tJr °^ ler ’ kardar Ihtisham being appointed in his Operations, 7.9/*-/^.-During the early part of the great European War German agents who were at work amongi 9 the tribes of South Persia with the object of embarrassing the active operations which were being undertaken in Mesopotamia by the British Ivxpediiionary borce and also as a direct menace to India, succeeded in affecting the tribes to such an extent that in the early part of 1918, fed by false promises and vague hopes, they began to display a very pronounced feeling of hostility which took thg form of active brigandage on the main communi* cations between Shiraz and Bushire and Bandar Abbas and Kerman. In order to restore confidence in the power of Britain and to allay the situation a force was assembled at Shiraz under the command of Brigadier General Sir Percy Sykes, consisting of two squadrons of cavalry, a mountain battery and 3 battalions of Indian Infantry. This force which was known as the Shiraz Column worked in conjunction with another similar column having its base at Kerman. In addition a force of three battalions of Indian Infantry, two sections of mountain artillery and one squadron of cavalry was assembled at Bushire under Major-General Douglas by October 1918, and a light railway was built from Bushire to Borazjun. This force when it advanced to open the road to Shiraz drew off a consider able number of the tribesmen who were opposing the Shiraz Column. r ! he country was swept as effectively as possible, but ow ing to the guerilla tactics of the tribes the operations entailed heavy marching and counter-marching before the resistance was finally broken up in March 1919, when the whole Shiraz force was transferred to Bushire and Bandar Abbas, certain units of its effectives being amalgamated with the Bushire force and the rest returning to India. There were no pitched battles of any importance during the two years’ operations, but several small skirmishes, in which the enemy as a rule fared badly. A feature of the advance of the striking force was the exceed ingly poor resistance put up by the enemy in spite of the great advantage they possessed owing to the very severe nature of the country. In three places in particular, the Fil-Fili, Malu and Tang-i-Turkan passes, it was fully expected that a passage would only be forced after a severe struggle. The two latter passes would appear to compare favourably from the point of view of a defending force with any pass on the North-West Frontier of India. Actually however the longest time the troops were held up ;vas a period of 2 —3 hours at the Malu Pass w hich was finally forced with negligible casualties. Indeed it was made abundantly clear that the fighting qualities of the Persian villager of this part of the country, when opposed by a properly10 equipped and organised force, had been greatly exaggc.,aed. Though the lawless nomadic tribes who have no settled homes and have always made their livelihood by highway robbery still continue their customary depredations on a small Scale, the country, as a result of these operations, enjoyed so long as the South Persia Rifles remained inexistence, an era of tranquillity since March 1919, probably rarely known in its history, and traffic was able to pass freely up and down the main commercial routes. In June 1920 the Bushire Field Force which had up till then been retained at Bushire as an emergency measure and as a moral factor was withdrawn and a return was made to this pre-war strength of the garrison.ciod. ettled ;hway small , r ed so )ra of m in &gt; and [) till nd as &gt; this 11 CHAPTER II Geography. Southern Persia, except for a coastal strip some 15 to 30 General - miles broad, is a country of ranges of rugged and barren hills, almost all running from north-west to south-east and gradually rising step by step till the valleys in the centre are from four to seven thousand feet above sea level. Needless to say these hills offer considerable obstacle to the progress of troops. It is in the valleys that the life of Persia lies, and they are often exceedingly fertile and well-watered and have been, con sidered by experts to be capable of supporting a population at least ten times as numerous as is now' to be found in them. The irrigation system has been well developed as far as carrying the water along from where it is found to where it is needed, but there is no system of reservoirs, and a vast amount of water runs to waste in the salt lakes of the country. The water system is a very complicated one and leads to a number of disputes every year. It would require very careful handling in an occupation of the country, if popular feeling was not to be aroused. The country is practically devoid of trees except where they have been cultivated or protected in private gardens ; this is possibly due partly to the lack of proper soil, but more probably to the lack of any State control to prevent deforestation; from the way trees grow in private gardens there seems no reason why the country should not be well-wooded if given a proper chance. (a) 1 drs and the Gulf Ports. Ears is one of the largest of the provinces of Persia, and from Fare, the British point of view almost the most important. It is bounded on the south by the Persian Gulf, while on the west its border marches with that of Arabistan. Starting from a few miles north of Bandar Dilam, where Arabistan and the Liravi district meet, the frontier follows the course of the Shur stream w hich runs a few miles east of and parallel to the Hindlan river, from the sea until it crosses the Hindlan near Deh Mulla. • Going north the frontier then crosses the Bam Hormuz-Beh- behan road between Jaizan and Kuraisheh and follows the Kuh- galu-Bakhtiari tribal boundary until the Qashqai country ^ reached.12 Ports. The boundary between the BakhtiarT territory and the Qashqai country (or Isfahan province—it is not always clear which) is then followed, Basaki being well within the former. The line, however, does not attain any precision anywhere. In this volume the Kuhgalu country is not dealt with, and the west ern boundary of the portion of Ears described in it runs from Id miles north of Bandar Dilam in a semi-circular sweep, which passes well to the east of Basht and joins the line of division men tioned above to the east of Basaki. The boundary between Ears and the province of Isfahan is scarcely less vague ; according to one version it crosses the Shiraz-Isfahan road just north of Yazd-i-Khast ; according to another 7^ miles north of that village, where it runs along the ridge of the Gard-i-Gir hills ; while according to the Farsnameh half way between Amlnabad and Maqsud Beg. The eastern boundary marches successively with that of Isfahan and with those of the AbrkQh and' Shahr-i-Babak districts of Yazd and of the Sirjan district of Kerman. Kerman province first adjoins Ears from a point some miles west of s nabad in the kapir. From this point the joint frontier runs south-east to Abu Bakr where the most northern point of Laristan is met. Turning south-we$t to XtTz and then slightly eastward o arab, the remainder of the eastern boundary of Ears is coter minous with the western border of Laristan : the same district accompanies Ears on the south, as its southern boundary now runs west and slightly south to Jahrum (which is in Ears)-finally urnmg more southward and meeting the coast of the Persian Gulf, seven miles to the east of Tahiri in the Shibkfdi district. Jhe area under the administration of the Governor of the Gulf Urts consists, with the exception of DashtT and shtetan, of the whole of the coastal strip extending from andar Dilam to the point where Persian and British Baluchis- from* disk ° f n5,b however on the B aban coast alonV the^ ! ^ board 1 from the BBter place eastwards nomfn-il C ° a8t Persian sovereignty is merely Ghahbar r,iudjrs * or Custc.ms Inspectors at Jask and sectiot of the ° fficials wh ° are fo ' nd 111 this f the Gulf, and their presence is only possible throrah afforded by the existence o^a BriEsh ffnrrisnn ♦^i , . ^ Ml c UI a nrit'S £3 t» «•* place.

It consists of valleys, seldom more than 5 miles wide, running roughly parallel to each other in a north-west and south-east direction, separated by barren mountain ranges some 3,000' in height. It is sparsely populated, villages, in some parts, lying at a great distance from one another; numerous ruins demonstrate the existence in former times of a much larger sedentary population ; the plains and valleys are sparsely wooded, the only common tree being the kundr or jujube, but on the higher hills there is a very large quantity of wood, small trees as a rule, wild almonds, banak and kulkhung predominating. Every village, however, small, has a patch of cultivation round it, the intervening country being desert. Grazing is usually excellent, but dry after May ; nomad tribes frequent this tract from November to April, spending the re!?t of the year in the sardslr. The date palm flourishes everywhere even in the more northerly districts; the fruit is but little exported, but forms an important addition to the indigenous food supply. Kaza- run represents about the most northerly point of cultiva tion of the date palm along the main caravan routes. Coastal Strip .—This is the flat alluvial tract lying between the sea and the most southerly mountain ranges of Fars. It generally level, partly alluvial and partly sandy, studded with date palm plantations and very sparsely wooded with the kundr bush. It has a relatively large population amounting in all to some 100,000 persons, and includes the districts of Llravi, Halat Baud, Rud Hilieh. Angali, Shabankareh, Zlra 7 , Mazarai, Borazjun, Tangistan and Dashtl. This tract commences from a point some 13 miles to the north of Bandar Dllam, where from the sea to the coastal chain of mountains is only a distance of 15 miles, and stretches south for roughly 150 miles until the southern border of Dashti is reached, where the coastal chain again comes to within a few miles of sea. This plain in good years produces large quantities of grain.

Hand. in the neighbourhood of Ziarat it has out innumerable gullies all over the plain and a wide detour has to be made. The Daliki bridge consists of 6 stone arches made of large cut stone blocks. The road way is 30 feet wide with a parapet, 3 feet high on either side. It is paved with fiat stone blocks. The highest arch is the third from the south end and has a clearance of 20 feet. Other arches have a clearance of about 15 feet. The bridge is in good repair, but is not strong enough for heavy motors. Its total length is 120 yards. The water channel is under the south end, and after rain is only about 25 yards wi e. The current is strong. There are fords at Diilik', Hooregah and Kulul, though ordi narily the stream is fordable for cavalry and infantry almost anywhere. The water of this river is very salt. (4) The Chdhkutah stream may be traced back to the small river which waters the productive Khaviz (Khaiz) valley. It is deep in places, but never very broad on its passage down towards Ahram. In the plain between Ahram and Chah-i- Plr there is practically no water in the autumn and its chief importance would seem to be the way in which it has cut up the plain for several miles and rendered it boggy, treacher ous and impassable in the rainy season. In the summer it is dry save for a few shallow pools of water heie and there. At Ahraadi the river-bed is about 15 yards across, and has little water, except after the winter rains, when it is frequently un- fordable for days. (5) The course of the Mand River, known in its upper reaches successively as the Waz and Kara Aghach, was for long unmapped. It rises in the mountains north of Khan-i-Zinian at a place called Bun Rud; it luen flows south south-east past Aiur to Kavar, its waters being utilized for irrigation at many points from Khan-i-Zinlan to Fas-i-Rudak in the Dizgah plain. It enters the Kavar plain by a defile, in which an ancient stone dam built for irrigation purposes exists; thence it Hows down the Kavar-Khafr valley to Taduan, where it cuts through the end of the Kuh-i-Safld by a remarkable gorge and, after a circuitous course amongst the mountains of the Simakan district, emerges to the desolate Manyun valley (20 miles west of Jahrum) where it is joined by the Fasa stream (practically dry in summer), by the Maimand stream, end, a little further down bv i Kal Mac Kar nan whii this Afz; Ku! bror ] eme I tribi smal emb It is 'Uar basil poin ; C333 •able ade. arge tpet, )cks. as a bout h for nnel jC. ordi- most iruall illey. lown ab-j- chief t up cher- • it is At little • un* ipper long inian -eaat m at izgah cient flows ■ough ter a triot, it of ry in down bv a fresh water river rising west of the deserted hill fort of Kalat-i-Zangibar, and flowing past the walled village of Madkhun in a narrow gorge. It obtains access to the Qir-o- Karzin plain, which it waters very completely, by a very narrow and precipitous gorge through the mountains, part of which is quite impassable even on foot. For some way after this it can be followed on horse or foot, through the plains of Afzar and Laghar-o-Maku, through the Tang-i-Shahriyari to Kupkab, near Gird Bisheh, where the valley is about 3 miles broad. Its course now becomes impassable for some miles until it emerges on to the Dizgah plain, where it is joined by— (i) The Kurdeh stream, dry for eight months in the year, rising a few miles west of Haftavan, («) the Alamarvdasht and Fidash stream, one branch rising a few miles south of Lar, another branch, running through the Tang-i-Khur, appearing to drain the neighbourhood of Khunj, Bukhard and Binaru, though this is doubtful; (Hi) the Shur river, a salt stream, rising in the Khwajal district, north of Firuzabad ; this tributary greatly exceeds the main stream in volume and is for the greater part of the year quite unfordable ; below the junction the waters of the Mand, by which name the stream then becomes known, are too salt to be of use for irrigation ; (iv) the Jam and Biz stream, fresh, but dry for 8 months in the year. It will be seen from the above survey of the river and its tributaries that it drains a very wide area ; the comparatively small volume of its waters is due to the fact that its basin embraces no lofty ranges, except perhaps the Kuh-i-Safid. It is also eloquent of the small rainfall of Laristan that the Alamarvdasht tributary, though 200 miles long, and with a basin as large as that of many an English river, is quite dry 8 months in the year. The Kara Aghach river is or was bridged at the following Kar * Agbftch. points : — (a) Khan-i-Zinian. {b) Kavar (bridge in ruins), C37CGS D34 Kur. (c) Qlf-o-Karzin plain. The Piil-i-Arus, a two-storied bridge, the roadway being in the upper storey. It is not certain that this bridge still exists. (d) Near Baghan. Remains of an ancient bridge. The river is useless for navigation; it is fordable except in flood time even at its mouth, where the depth at low water does not usually exceed feet. It can be ascended by native craft of 40 tons burden almost as far as Kaki. Khur Ziarat which forms its mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be entered at high water, but the entrance is exposed and does not form a good harbour for native craft. For a short distance to the north of it, and for some miles southward, the coast of the mainland is swampy. There are certain rivers of Ears which do not reach the sea ; there is only one such of importance, the Kur or Bandarair of which the Pulvar is a tributary. The Pulvar rises in the Chehar Pangeh district, with a branch rising in the hills north of Dehbid. The main stream flows through a lake or marsh in Latitude 30° 30', Longitude 52° 50' and is crossed by the Shiraz-1 sfahan road under Khan-i- Khirgah. It flows through the Mashhad-i-Murghab plain past Pasargadae and the tomb of Cyrus, and through the Tang-i- Bulaghi to Sivand and Khafrak, finally effecting a junction with the parent stream in Marvdasht. The main stream known as Kur rises in the Ujan Valley and runs north-west to Dizkurd, then turning south and south-east runs through Kam Firuz and Ramjird to . andasht, where it forms extensive marshes in spring time; then passing through the Kurba it falls into Lake Niriz. ic river is extensively used for irrigation and many dams obstruct its course.

They are briefly described below : — ( 1 ) The Fdmur Lake, or Darya-i-Parishan ; in the Kazarun Famiir : district, 13 miles south-east of the town of that name ; a long narrow sheet of water stretching north-west and south-east about 3 £ miles long by £ to 1 mile broad. On its south side it is very shallow but doubtless deepens towards the centre: lofty limestone hills lie to north and south of it: it is fed by a stream coming in from the south-east dose to the village of Famur; its marshy banks afford excellent grazing, and good shooting and fishing. (2) The Dasht-i-Arjan Lake, in the plain of the same name? Daaht-i-Arjan. dries up almost entirely in summer: extensive marshes lie on its banks. {3) Mahdrlu, the smallest of the three main salt lakes of Maharla * Fars: situated in the Shiraz plain surrounded by low hills : fed by the Shiraz stream and by the drainage of Sarvistan. Extensive marshes lie at its northern end, very shallow for more than a mile from the shore; numerous fresh water springs exist along its shores. Water-fowl abound. (4) Nargis or Tashk, the second largest of the salt lakes of Nar 8 ls. Fars, lying to the north of Lake Niriz, with which it is connected by two channels and which it resem bles generally. (5) Niriz or Niriz Bakh/igan—The largest of the salt lakes Nirlz * of Fars, lying 5 miles west of Shiraz. Length 60 k miles, breadth 3 to 5 miles: it receives the waters of the Kur or Bandamir. In a dry summer season the water evaporates entirely and the bed may then be crossed on foot,; the salt which remains is extensively collected ; it is of fine quality and much in demand throughout Fars. Water-fowl such as swans, flamingoes, and ducks abound. The shores have no sandy beach, but consist of soft, fine, evil-smelling mud. It contains no fish. There is a fresh spring at Khur. Several wooded islets break the monotony of the surface of the Jake.36 Islanclu. Kharag.

Khdmg.^-A considerable island lying with its south-eastern point west-north-west of Bilshire town. It is over 4 miles in length from north to south, and its average breadth is about 2 miles. The greater part of it consists of almost barren, table- topped hills, highest in the middle and at the south end where they exceed 250 feet. Towards the north they decrease in eleva- iion and terminate in cliffs only 20 to 30 feet high. The only low ground is a plain about one square mile in extent, which forms a protuberance on the north-east side of the island, carry. Uig at its extremity the only village oli the island and the re mains of a Dutch fort. This low part has a sandy soil. The island is surrounded by a reef about £ mile broad. The best anchorages anti landings are off the village, but they are exposed, and the holding ground is rocky and indifferent. The beach is of small breadth and rises somewhat abruptly from the sea. The climate is said to be Very salubrious, and is not as moist as Bitshire. ‘ The maximum range of the temperature in the hot weather is seldom above 95 degrees in tents. The village con sists of about 120 houfees inhabited by some 600 degenerate Arabs talking a mixture of Persian and Arabic. Seven-eighths of the population are Sunnis. They are quiet and unwarlike, but possess a few Martini rilies. Their sole occupation is fishing. On the north-east extremity is a quarry of hard and soft lime stone. About 4,000 tons has been quarried in a month, when required for Special purposes on the mainland, but it is not worked by the inhabitants. There are 4-5 wells in the village which contain excellent Water. They yield sufficient over and above the requirements of the inhabitants to supply some 300 coolies, if it were requir ed to work the quarries for stone. The island is subject to the Khan of Haiat Daud, who is represented by his qai'i or deputy on the spot. Khargv. -A very low, white and sandy island lying with its Southern point 2£ miles north of the island of Kharag. It is 3 miles in length from north to south and only | mile wide.

Rich gardens and vineyards exist in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from December to April, is usually drv for the rest of the year, the water being used tor irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake, the upper margin of which is perhaps 12 miles from Shiraz in a south-easterly direction. Five miles south of Shiraz the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. The city is irregularly circular in shape flanked by semi-circular towers, rising some feet above the parapet, which is bounded by a dry ditch. Both towers and wall are in bad repair, the latter in some instances having fallen and filled up the ditch so that it is quite easy to ride through the gayis. The southern wall is in tolerable repair. The circumference of the wall is about 4 miles, but in more recent and peaceful times the suburbs have become enlarged so that the original outline is no longer clearly traceable. More than half of the enclosed area of the city is taken up with bazaars, maiddns, the Governor’s palace, gardens, stables and other public buildings, leaving the remaining space for occupation by the inhabitants. The city has 6 gates • The population is probably not over 50,000, including about 7,000 Jews. There are in Shiraz fifty considerable mosques, besides many others of inferior note to a total number of fifty, eleven colleges, fourteen bazaars, thirteen mramnsamia and fifty-six baths. W hile the houses of Shiraz are, in general, small and the streets narrow and filthy, the great bazaar, built by Karim Khan and commonly called the Bazar-i-VakIJ, situated at the north-east corner of the city, forms a distinguished exception •to this general description. It is built .in the shape of a cross and is about 500 yards in length by 120 yards in breadth, having a vaulted roof 22 feet high. Local provisions of excellent quality are obtainable, and are found in abundance. The Ark, or citadel, in which the Governor-General of FEfs resides, is a rectangular building about 80 yards square, with large open spaces on three sides. The palace within is far from being an elegant structure. Town*. Shlr&amp;a.38 ,wf*o£ Abfldeh. A British Consul resides permanently in Shiraz. About half a mile outside and north-west of the city is a garden where the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department live. A chief branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia is established in the city. Communications radiate in every direction, but only by caravan, except to Isfahan, to which there is a carriage road. The tomb of the celebrated poet Hafiz is half a mile outside the city. Among the local manu factures are rough carpets, ndmad (felt), tents and curtains, small arms, swords, daggers and foot wear. The local wine is celebrated. Abddeh .-—Elevation 6,100', a town about half-way between Shiraz and Isfahan on the road between them ; it is the chief place of a district of the same name under a Deputy Governor (subordinate to Shiraz), who is generally a local man and has for years been a nominee of the Ilkhdnl of the Qashqai. The town is walled, but there is a considerable population resident without the walls and in adjacent villages. The estimated population is 8 , 000 . The Indo-European Telegraph Department have a station here, with a clerk in charge ; there is also telephone com munication with Qumisheh and Dehbid. The wall is reported to be in good condition. It is of mud varying in thickness from 8 feet at the bottom to 4 feet at th 6 top. Most of the houses are of sun-baked brick, one-storied, and are well built. I he remainder are of mud and straw. The lort is situated about 1,200 yards to the north of the town. Its walls are of sun-burnt brick from six to eighteen inches in thickness. The chief industries are the manufacture of malikls (Persian cloth shoes), furniture, inlaid wares, felts and carpets. The majority of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, the chief crops being wheat, barley, opium, raisins, grapes and almonds. 1 Water is plentiful and good.

The town is the head quarters of the kaldnt'lr of the district. Supplies abundant, the town being the market of a large area. Animals have been estimated at 50 horses, 1,000 cows, 5,000 sheep. Cotton, rice, opium and w heat are cultivated. Airiz .—Elevation 4,280', a tow n and district at the south Nj r j z . end of Lake Xiriz. The town, which is scattered amongst groves and gardens, is surrounded by extensive cultivation of cereals and opium. The suburbs extend 2 miles to the w est. The town contained in 1903 about 2,500 houses and 4 sarais. The popu lation is probably not over i,000. The population of the town is purely Persian, and quite distinct from the tribes dwelling on the shore of the lake which should be classed as nomadic, though they do not shift their quarters with the change of season. Jdhrvm,.- Elevation 3,200', a town and district 90 miles Jahrum. south-east of Shiraz, situated in an extensive plain of the same name under the northern slope of Kuh-i-Alburd. Of the walls of the town practically nothing now remains; access can only be . obtained by the gates of the tow n of which there are about six connected with each other by thin garden walls, or the backs of houses. Many of the houses possess turrets, which are used lor the faction fights prevalent in the town. The number of houses is about 2 , 000 ; the tow n is completely surrounded by date plantations which make it appear larger than it really is. There is only one large sarai, at the south-west of the town ; it would hold half a squadron. The population of the town was estimated in 1911 at 5,000. The land round Jahrum is for the most part irrigated with water drawn by bullocks from wells; the plain is everywhere dotted with these wells, many of which are brackish. There is good running water 2 miles east of the town supplying large gardens. I I here is a post weekly to Shiraz, and occasionally to Lar. Fruit is extensively grow n for local consumption; raisins are exported and sometimes dates. Malikis (Persian cloth shoes) are largely manufactured and sent for sale to Shiraz. Few mules or pomes are available, but plenty of donkeys The people are as unpleasant and unmannerly as are to be found40 in any town of south-west Persia. The town is managed by one and or more Icaldniars, who are responsible for the revenue; a deputy an d governor’seldom makes his appearance and is never, even when ness present, in a position to enforce his authority. Some 15 miles frequ to the east of the town is the liaharlu fort of Kalat-i -1 awar. para] Firuzabad.—ls surrounded by a mud wall and ditch and T there are a few plantations of date trees round it. It con- ^ ^ tains some 200 houses : on the outskirts of the town is a large ° h ^ } walled house, the residence of the Ilkhdni of the Qashqai tribe ( uar) who is the ex-officio Governor of Firuzabad and Farashband. ^ ^ The town, though walled, is incapable of offering any resistance to an army and is commanded by a low range of hills on the T east side. The inhabitants are for the most part engaged in vale fruit farming and cultivation ; there are also a few carpet- trees makers. The people are civil and disposed to be friendly. Firuzabad is the best place along the route to Niriz from menl Bushire vid Jahrum. Its chief importance from a military point of view is that it is admirably suited for a halting place T and a supply depot. The estimated population of the town perso is 4,000. ' souls This district enjoys a moderate climate and is generally alway healthy The heat is never excessive. Colonel Taylor recom- chief! mended it as being in every way eligible for a cantonment. synag The whole of the plain around the town is extremely fertile, r ] and, for Persia, well inhabited. It bears the same name as the are ei town and is elevated, well watered and bears rich wheat and in spi famous rice. It is one of the best corn-producing and grazing healt districts in Persia. For the most part it is 7 miles w ide, but at the princ south-eastern extremity narrows to 5 miles. Here it only pro- ■ the I duces grass and has a rocky mountain ridge on either hand, that road, on the north-east rising to 2,000 feet. It has only 13 villages. draug It is watered by the Firuzabad river, which has its sources in the an ea Dasht-i-Muk and enters and leaves the plain by great gorges, the place last of which has perpendicular cliffs, 500 feet high : it then are tc joins its w aters with those of the Kara Aghach and flows ink whicl the Mand river {q.v.).

The buildings are of stone and mortar and have an appearance of solidity and neat ness which is wanting in mud habitations: they are also frequently stuccoed. Many of them are fortified, possessing parapets and loop-holes for musketeers. The town is reckoned to contain 3,000 houses, quite one-third of which are in ruins, imparting a desolate look to the streets, which is rather belied by the scenes of activity in the commercial quarter and in the crowded bazar, where some 50—60 shops are to be found. The situation is on the north-west side of a well-cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms and walnut, orange and lemon trees are nearly the only verdure it possesses. There is an office of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart, ment here, open for international traffic. The population of the town in 1019 was said to be 10,000 persons. The total population of the valley is about 20,000 souls and is well armed. They are quick-tempered and are always fighting each other. There is a colony of 200 Jews, chiefly engaged in the goldsmiths’ trade residing around their synagogue on the southern edge of the tow n. The people are proud of their orange gardens, but the oranges are either sour or bitter. Provisions are abundant here, except in spring, and the valley abounds in forage ; it is said to be very healthy except in the autumn months. Water is supplied principally from qanats. It is noteworthy that Kazarun is the home of many muleteers engaged on the Bushire-Shlraz road. Firewood can be procured. Warm felts, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack saddles for draught cattle and malikis, an easy shoe for hill-marching, form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather dressers «nd tent makers are to be found here and in the vicinity Timber, called safiddr, which is a white poplar, plane and w alnut trees are procurable. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood and pow^der might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the moun tains to the north-east of the town and brought down for use in summer. Towards the Shahpur end of the valley are rice swamps and a large amount of rice is imported from Khuzistan and the Mamassani district.42 Harbours Bushire. At Bush.ikan in Shihpur sulphur is found deposited by $ spring and there is salt of the best quality in the hills to the north east of the town. J ' Mules and horses of a good stamp could be bought during the cold weather from the nomad tribes, and a few are often available in the town itself. The climate is reckoned by Persians to be the best in Fars. It 'is warmer than Shiraz in summer, but not oppressively hot. Mosquitoes are less prevalent than in Shiraz. Bus' ire .—A torpedo-shaped promontory lying parallel to the coast of the Persian district of Tangistan at a distance of 4 or 5 miles ; the intervening space is occupied by a swampy mud plain, across the middle of which runs a caravan route to the mainland. ... The peninsula measures exactly 12 miles from its north west point on which stands the town of Bushire, to Ras Halileh at the opposite end. The maximum breadth at about mid way is about 3£ miles. The peninsula^ is bounded by the sea on the north, west and south ; on the east it is bounded by the swampy mud plain or mashileh. This latter would in wet weather form a serious obstacle to an advance from Bushire and to the -maintenance of communications. Moreover when once wet it takes a long time to dry, and a portion of it is liable to be Hood ed at high tides, especially whe these arc combined with strong southerly winds. The soil is clay mixed with gypsum ; in con sequence, though it would riot be difficult to make a road across it, any such road would be most expensive to maintain, if subjected to heavy traffic. Throughout December, January and February it is useless for military purposes to count upon this as a road to the Bushire Hinterland. For 0 months of the year, however, it makes an excellent road; the surface gets packed, and cars can drive oveFit at high Speed. The railway which was laid to Borazjfm had its worst trouble here, and the line was washed out on two occasions. The water level on the mashileh is at 0 feet. During the three winter months mentioned above an alter native route to the interior which is frequently used is from -Bushire across the Harbour by boat to Shif and thence to Borazjun. There is a local staked road 'to Gurak which gives compara tively good going even during the floods.

There’ is a stretch of low cliff at the south-west corner of Bushire town and again in the neighbourhood of Reshire. The low parts of the peninsula are sandy, the higher of firm, arable soil. After ram in the winter and spring a little grass appears in odd places. A few her tamarisk and bulbul trees are found and an occasional cypress, scattered over the island chiefly in and around the gardens of houses. There are also a few very small date plantations especially on the low ground near the mashdeh to the north of the British Residency a t Sabzabad, Most of the ground is a sandy waste with patches of rock outcropping at frequent intervals. Fruit gardens and date palms exist near houses and pits dug dow n throughout the top layer of rock are found all over the island containing vines and ng trees. The wells are nearly all brackish and only hold sufficient water to irrigate small plots containing a few vegetables. Bushire is situated on a bay, the entrance to which, measured m a north-westerly direction from Bushire town to the nearest part of the Rud Hilleh coast, is 5 miles in width. The greater part of the bay is very shallow, and a large part of it is occupied by mud flats. Inhabitants —The population is about 16,000. Roadstead. The port of Bushire consists of an open roadstead with an inner and an outer anchorage. At low water the former has a depth of 21 feet, while .the latter has a depth of 30 feet, llie two anchorages are separated by mud flats with only 15 feet of water on them at low water. In the inner anchorage there is room for mooring 6 or 7 vessels of the British India type em- ? niw ° n tHe Persian GuIf run &gt; *'' e - vessels of from 3,500 to f 3 - 00 i ons g ross ^ter, in 18 feet of water. The outer has loom for a large number of feteamers in 4 to 5 fathoms. It is marked by a buoy fitted with an automatic occulting white I ght, while a second buoy with an automatic occulting red lieht la moored close to the inner anchorage.44 Twenty-one feet is the greatest draught with which a vessel can safely enter the inner anchorage, and for this depth of water the conditions have to be favourable, the height of the tide being influenced by the prevailing wind. W ith a southerly wind good tides are experienced, while with a northerly wind the reverse ij the case. The latter predominate. The holding ground in both anchorages is of a soft mod and L&lt; good, and there is no rocky bottom in their vicinity. With i southerly wind especially, or with a northerly wind the oute: anchorage soon becomes unusable owing to the heavy swell, anc in any fresh breeze sufficient sea rises to make the disembark tion of troops and stores a task of considerable difficulty. The distance from the wharves to the inner anchorage is? miles, and to the outer 7 miles by the boat channel. In tht channel between the inner anchorage and the wharves only fin feet of water is obtainable at low water. The draught of craf employed for discharging vessels should therefore, if possible, no exceed 4 feet 6 inches. The maximum rise of tide at Bashir is about 5 feet 6 inches, but, as pointed out before, this rise t a great extent depends on the prevailing wind. No fixed moorings are provided. I Coast.—The coast is shelving, generally sandy, but roch in places. Cliffs run from the south end of the town for half mile to the south. Thence no more cliffs occur till Reshir 1 5£ miles south of Bushire. Tides and currents.—Tides do not run strongly enough t interfere with landing in boats, and there are no dangeroi currents. Lights .—Two lights placed vertically are exhibited from f! British (town) Residency flagstaff ; one white, fixed, is 72 fe above high water and should be seen from a distance of miles ; the other red, fixed, is 54 feet above high water ar should be seen from a distance of 11 miles. Light Buoys .—A light-buoy exhibiting a white occulfii light every ten seconds, eclipse 3 seconds, is moored in t! outer anchorage in 4| fathoms, of water, 4J miles westwa of the British (town) Residency.

There is no shelter of any description from the prevailin; winds, i.e., southerly and north-westerly, and, as Dastak is II miles from Bushire by sea, there is some risk in using this whar except in settled weather. The construction of a break-wak: from Reshire point in a south-easterly direction so as to foru a sheltered anchorage would.be an expensive undertaking. In 185P, the troops landed on the open sandy beach in Hal Hleh bay, 10 miles south of Bushire, which was found in ever way suitable. If there wete no opposition, the Customs Hous is the most convenient landing place, as it is sheltered, has a loni line of mud embankment faced with stone, and deep wafer for boats alongside. Animals can w'alk ashore from nativs craft, but there are no facilities for them. Two other landing places are opposite the former Russia and German Consulates, where the shore is sandy and firn; In all the above cases however troops, even if landed in sraal boats carrying 15-20 men apiece, would have to wade a shor distance to reach dry land. Shamdl' and the 7 aus would interfere with boats loading along .side the ships, and their passage ashore. Provided the Shrtmal ; not blowing, stores can be landed at Bushire all the year round but troops cannot well be landed between April and Octok on account of the extreme heat.

The above-mentioned qnaa Sv could easily be stored and it is probable that half as much again could be accommodated without difficulty arid without taking up space required for the needs of the local merchants. During the operations in 1918 practically all the troops and stores for the force were landed at this point. All troops, annuals and baggage were put ashore with the greatest ease as the lighters containing them were able to come r,ght alongside, he deck of the barges being always within a few feet of the jett) level The jetty area, however, was somewhat restricted forthe forming up of troops on landing. It should be borne in mind that on this occasion large tugs and lighters from Basra were available. With the sailing boats and other craft which alone are available locally the task would have been very much more difficult Owing to the small amount of ground available in rear of the jetties it is essential to have abundant transport and a large number of coolies always available at the landing place to prevent There are no cranes and no facilities whatever for landing heavy loads and everything must be man-handled. This fact should be very carefully noted. The material for the railway was landed in the following manner. A single line oi, railway was projected to the end of the jetty, built up on loose sleepers. Railway lines were laid on a lighter, and engines anc trucks were lowered on to this from transports out at sea anc were brought alongside the line on the jetty which was linked up to the line on the barge, and the vehicles were then pushed ashore All other heavv loads were man-handled. Aci'ommodation .—The buildings in rear of the wharf {vidt sketch) are comparatively new and built of stone. 1 heir roofs, however, are not waterproof and tarpaulins would be necessary. The reservoir is built of cement and is very strong. It i&gt; capable o fcontaining 100,000 gallons of fresh water. On thespaee marked S. andT. about 10,000 tons of goods were oftenstoi ked :n 1918.

These were chiefly used by Mule and Camel Corps prior to going up the line and also at times as segregation camps. A certain proportion of a Labour Corps was also camped there for a short period. A Government Dairy Farm was located in a building in Square J-22-C. Sheds were constructed in the vicinity for 80 cows, and the land in Square J. towards the sea was cultivated for vegetable growing, etc. The water for the Reshire area was manufactured in the Dastak condenser (Square M.-9-B.) The water was pumped from the condenser to a large reservoir or tank at P. From this reservoir it was distributed to units under Supply and Transport arrangements. Water was also obtained from the wells of Andar Bandar, which was distributed by means of donkeys. Of the small ports between Bushire and Lingeh only the following five are worthy of mention : — (1) Dalylr .. Port of Dashti. (2) Tahiri (3) Asalu (4) Mughu (5) Charak Saliseh Port (see special notice below). Saliseh Port. Shibkuh Port. Shibkilh Port. The chief reasons for their importance are : — (a) their good anchorages. (b) The fact that they are starting points for caravans proceeding to the interior. (c) The comparatively-speaking large amount of trade which passes through them. The Saliseh Ports are (from Bushire to the south)— 1. Kangiin 2. Tumbak 3. Tahiri 4. Asalu 5. Naiband Sheikh. Population.

It is in a small open ba'y, formed by two low points 2 miles apart and covered with date groves, the village is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range, here 700' high. It containa &lt; 150 stone houses, inhabited chiefly by Arabs with some ' Persian Shi ahs. Water is obtained from wells 3 fathoms deep. A few horses, donkeys, cattle (2.')) and sheep and goats (300) are the only live stock reported here, but more are said to be inland. lahiri has 14 sailing boats, chiefly bums of 15—20 tons average burthen. 1 lie importance of Tahiri lies in the fact that vessels can be brought quite close inshore, instead of, as is usually the case in the Gulf, having to lie a long w ay out. The bay deepens regulaily from the coast to 8 fathoms at mile off shore. Ihe oniy routes into the interior are by two passes, by blocking wnich an enemy could be confined to the narrow strip along the sea coast. The hinterland is sparsely populated and little known, and thus the place would appear admirably adapted for smuggling operations. The inhabitants own about six trading aambilqs. Bandar Dilaw. — A small port of the Liravi district, but not Bandar form inti part of it administratively : 85 miles north-north-west of Bushire and at an equal distance east-north-east, of the Khatt- al-Arab nar. ihe town stands upon a low' coast running north and south, and consisting of a strip of rocky land 10' to 15' above sca-level with swamps behind extending several miles inland. Half a mile to the south is a little cultivation with some trees, and to the east is a plain containing a few villages dependent on Dilam. A square fort in a very delapidated condition stands in the middle of the town and 1} miles to the north east is the fort of Funub, which protects the water supply. The town formerly belonged to the Dutch. Ihe anchorage for vessels, about eI miles off the shore, is sheltered from the shamul and partially from the kaus ; the bottom is of soft mud and the depth of water four fathoms ; native craft lie eiose in to the beach in a creek in a mud fiat. Landing is difficult, because of the mud, and cargoes are unloaded and loaded by means of donkeys.54 Bandar Big. The population is from 1,000 to 2,000 souls of the Behbehan. tribe and is entirely Shi ah ; all are Persian-speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic as well. Some are culti vators in the surroundinu Liravi district, others are sailors or fishermen, and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. The resources of the place are inconsiderable ; drinking water is scarce and indifferent : it is brought from Tunub, about 1 mile distant. About 20 horses, 200 donkeys and f'OO sheep and goats are owned by the inhabitants. 1 here are do sailing vessels, chiefly bums, average tonnage 15 20 tons, also some 20 small fishing boats. Bnadar Big.—The port and chief town of the Haiat Baud district, 30 miles north-north-west of Push ire. It stands upon a low sandy coast, which runs north and south. 1 here is a creek at the town, fronted by two sand banks, inside which native erait lie aground at low water. On the north and south the town is adjoined by cultivated lands belonging to adjacent \illages, and on the east, at about 2 miles distance, is a cham of low sandhills, which screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. r Lhe only defensive work is the loop-holed, semi-fortified residence of the Khan, built of stones and mud. The village possesses a few date trees and two unimportant shrines. The inhabitants number about 2,000 souls; they are a mongre, breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominates. Persian, modified by the Lur dialect, is the language spoken. The people are cultivators, boatmen, sailors and traders: they are reputed peaceable and not fanatical, but they are fairly well armed with modern magazine and Martini rifles in about' equal proportions. Few of the male population are without a rifle of their own. They are Shi’ah Muhammadans, but tradi tions survive of a time when some of them v r ere Cabrs. Water is obtained from shallow wells, about 10 in number, some 2 mile north-east of the village. It is of excellent &lt; uality but hardly more than sufficient for the req uirements of the inhabitants. A force of 100 men could probably be provided for without difficulty. The water from the wells in the village itself is brackish. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys, also 100 cattle and (0) sheep and goats are owned in the town and there are 35 sailing craft, chiefly tudshaict hs with a fe 1 smal abou E with of P The barle of cu weigl const is erg ard c G at th to th and - on t Then the E room agrov ships sandj craft The i the b and f whicl The - brick Tf quiet, but tl arms, impor W north groun55 hani )OUt ulti- ilorg •s. ater l)OUt leep iling e 20 )aud mds re is hieh outh 5 to :e, is view only ■e of i few re a ates. &gt;ken. they airly bout' &gt;ut a radi- uber, ality f the dded the i 150 ivned with a few bums of 15-20 tons burthen. There are also some 6-8 small fishing boats. A Persian post office was opened hem about 1901 and a telegraph office about 1904. Bandar Rig is a very prosperous port, dealing principally with Bushire and Kuwait and serving the considerable district of Haiat Baud and a part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazaar contains about 50 shops. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle. The Persian hrdn is the basis of currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The unit of weight is a Hd&lt;him man equal to 26 Tabriz man of Bush ire, and consequently different from the Hdshim man of that place, whmh is equivalent to 16 Tabriz man of the same town. The stand ard of length is a gaz of inches. Gandveh'—k small port about 10 miles north of Bandar R T g Ganfiveh. at the mouth of the Khur Khalil, which extends some two miles to the north-east. The Khur has a depth of 6 feet at high tides and 4 at low tides. The former stone quay which was situated on the west bank has fallen into rains and is not used now. There are no landing facilities. There is an anchorage inside the Khi r which is 50 yards wide just above the quay. There is room here for at least 20 heliums drawing 5-6 feet. They are aground at low water. There is also an anch rare for large ships outside, and th s is sheltered from the north and south l y sandy points, but is open to t he west. There are some local craft which trade with BTshire, Bandar Abbas and Masqat. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have recently made Ganilveh the base for their investigations for oil inland at Dasht i-Qil, and for this purpose have erected a wireless set at the port, which can communicate with Maidan-i-Naftf n and Dasht-i-Qil. The village of Ganaveh contains some 250 houses, chiefly of brick with a few reed huts. The inhabitants who number about 1,300, are peaceful and quiet. They are of mixed race similar to those of Bandar Rig, but the Persian element predominates. They possess very few arms. Their chief occupation is trade with the Gulf Ports and importation of goods from the interior. Water is good from some 6 wells situated one mile to the north-east of the village in sandv soil. There is a camping ground for two brigades bore.56 Yazd. Towns. Yazd. (h) yazd. The proA’inoe of Yazd occupies a central position in Persia both geographically and commercially. Its boundaries are very ill-defined. To the south-west it is bounded by Kars ;vide previous paragraphs). Its western border runs from the junction of Pars and Ispahan along the border.of the latter until it reaches a point 25 miles north-west of Nam where it runs due east and marches with Pasht-i-KavIr to the south west border of Khoiasan. This it follows in a south-east direction to the junction of Kerman and Khurasan, some 100 miles north of Kerman itself. Hence it passes due westward again south of Bafq to a point 45 miles south-south- east of Yazd toAvn, Avhere it bears south along the Kerman border to its junction Avith that ot bars. The proA’ince itself is but little inhabited and consists of a number of villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of Yazd to the north-east, north-west, south-east and south Avest and comprising some 951 villages in all. The population in 1900 amounted to 20,000 inhabitants. Yazd, elevation 4,075', capital of the district, lies 200 miles south-east of Isfahan, and some 220 miles north-Avest of Kerman. Its chief characteristics are tho number of wind towers (badgir) and water reservoirs {ah ambar). The streets are narrow, dirty, unpaved and half filled Avith sand. Houses have often two underground stories. Great plains extend to the north and south, but gardens for at least a mile from the city are gradually dominating the sand. The old town, in Avhich is the art or citadel, the residence of the Governor, has walls, bastions and a ditch. The art', too, is well fortified and calculated to resist the attack of a mob. The main bazaar is fairly Avell built and lighted ; the side ones are dark and dirty. The population is put at 60.900, and among these the Parsls form an important community. About 1,090 live in the city, and 6,000 more in villages outside. The streets in their quarters are Avider, cleaner and more sanitary, and their houses better than in the rest of the city. There are about 1,000 Joavs ; these baA r e a hard life. A few native Indians engaged in trade live here, and a small kuropean community exists, including five missionaries, fne feeling against them has died aAvay and they are now not only respected but liked. caraA Mesh good: Opiu indus want radia has a ment entiri the c and ( A some carav villag tion surro rise t Avhicl of wl grapl I)epa join.

There is no trade as the town lies off the main route. Mountains .—One of the chief ranges of the great mountain system which runs across Persia from north-west to south east cuts across the province of Yazd to the west of Yazd city. Roughly speaking it extends from Nadushan to Kalvand, and consists in itself of several ranges also running from north-west to south-east and connected by high ground with an average elevation of 5,500 feet. The highest peaks of the range are the Sh r Kiih, 13,740 feet, the Kuh-i-T zarjan, 13,986 feet, and the Kuh Ardarushk, about 14,500 feet. These hills as a rule rise gradually from the Yazd side and fall abruptly on the other side to the level of the plateau. (c) Ldristdn. Laris tan is bounded on the south by the northern shore of the Persian Gulf opposite the Pirate Coast, and has a coast line of about 220 miles. On the north-west and north it marches with Pars, on the north-east with Kerman and on the east with the district of Shamil. Like most provinces ot Persia its boundary on the land side is ill-defined and vague, but it may be taken as starting in the west from the eastern boundary of Galehdar and from there takes a semi circular sweep in a north-east direction to Bidshahr passing just to the south of that village and some 20 miles south ot dahrum; from here d runs north-east to a point about midway between Rusta] and Lurg and then, taking a curve to the south wa Kajhu and Guhra nnd Latldan, to the sea at the mouth of the Shur River near Khamlr.

Ldr .—The capital town of the province stands at an alti- Towns, tude of 2,975'. It is 153 miles from Shiraz and 127 from Lar ' Bandar Abbas, situated at the west end of a valley running from east and west and nestling- at the foot of low, limestone hills, which block the west extremity of the valley ; it is not visible from any great distance on the roads leading to it. It is an unwalled city covering about £ square mile* dominated by two steep, limestone hills about 400' above the level of the city. The north hill contains one or two huts ana the ruins of an old fort. The north slope was formerly descended by a large ditch with bastions, the remains of which are still visible. The other hill is crowmed by the ruins of an old mud fort, now entirely dilapidated, and commanded from the top of the northern hill which is about 1,200 yards away. Lar has a population of approxiir'tely 8,000 souls. There are no local manufactories and the place owes its importance to the fact that it is a centre of trade and a halting place for large caravans. It has a covered bazaar with shops ; close to the west and east ends of the bazaar there are two large roofed cisterns, some 35'deep, containing a large supply of good water. The houses are usually commodious and well-built with a central courtyard. There are numerous cisterns in which rain water is collected and a number of large wells about 70' deep which give brackish water. There is also a large qana giving a large supply of water. The residence of the Covernor is in the centre of the town surrounded by a strong Avail flanked with towers. In the centre of the toAvn and close to the bazaar there are two large sarais about SO' square surrounded by small rdfoms. Fvrg or Furl -.—Elevation 2,800', Furg is the next toAvn of importance. It is situated 156 miles from Bandar Abbas, 189 r °’ miles from Lingeh and 107 miles from Shiraz. The town is built in the form of a square with sides about 400 yards long and is surrounded by a high mud wall, flanked at intervals of 75 yards by round mud toAvers, Avhile a larger toAver in the centre is used as a keep. There is no moat and the defences are in c, very dilapidated state.60 Llngeh. * Furg was at one time an important place, but now, thouol ca pa I ile of accommodating 1,000 people, has only 100 to Iji inhabitants, while the total population of the Furg plain exclusive of wandering Arabs, of whom many pitch their tent in the neighbourhood, does not exceed 500. It has a ba/aat but there are very few shops. Lingnh. — Roadstead .—Ships at Lirigeh usually anchor J to j mile from the landing place, and are able to do so in all weathers There is room for a great number of vessels, but no lixed moor ings are provided. Coast .—The coast is shelving, and the beach sandy. AL ground near is low lying and sandy, with a gentle rise inlami. Five fathom line is half to three quarters of a mile fros shore. Tides and currents .—Tides do not run strongly enough to interfere with landing from small boats, and there are a dangerous currents. J'tlofs .—No pilots are required, since there is no bar. Launches—One of the Customs launches, size about 85 fea long with a 6 foot draught is generally stationed here, but ot other steamers of any kind. Landing places For troops .—inexpedient to land troops op posite the town, they could utilize any point up to 5 miles to th west or 10 miles to the east. The shore is everywhere saiujy and shelving though rocky in places, and transports couf approach to within half a mile. Normal!/ the surf L- ftGghgible, but when a sduth-east gale is'blowing it is dangcroii: to land from small boats. u ^ at } ve boats. Some 20 or 30, of 25 to 35 tons, and num bers of smaller craft, are always available. In non-pcarlim seasons o0 to OGJ^oats are left drawn up on the beach. supplies.—Uirge stocks are not kept bv the Lingeh n chants In an emergency, a force of 1,000 men could be r vided for for a period of 2 weeks. Landing FacUitie-s.-There are two small boat harboi both some 80 yards square, formed cf stone breakwaters.

The western most of these two harbours would be the best to use for the reason that the shore is better, and from the landing placearoad leads straight out through the town to the camping grounds outside, and is of sufficient width to allow mule earts to pass without trouble. From the eastern harbour the streets through the bazaar to the outside of the town are extremely narrotv and tortuous and are practically impassable to wheeled traffic. Landing appliances. Ao steam engines, winches, trollies, carts, hawsers, cables, etc., are available. Wharf amd lightermen.—In the cool season about 200 coolies, who are mostly Mina bis, are employed, but in the hot season labour is very scarce as the majority go off to Minab. Convoy grounds—A large open space, j mile from the store godowns is suitable, with large birkehs (tanks) from which, in normal years, ample water is available; there is no grazing in the vicinity. After good rain camels bring, in grass from places 3 to 9 miles distant. Excellent camping grounds exist outside and to the north of the town, where the ground is flat and of stony sand which however in many places becomes rather a quagmire in wet weather. Two spots are particularly suitable for a camp on account of the proximity to a number of birkehs. The first starts l mile north-east of the wireless station and stretches 1,100 yards to the north and 2-3 mile to the east. Within £ mile of this point are some 20 birkehs. A wide road leads straight from the landing place opposite the Fort, half a mile distant. The second camping ground is | mile due west of the western extremity of the town and 2—300 yards east of the Quarantine station. The level ground commences withm 3C0 yards of the shore and is some 800 yards square. Within | mile there are 12 birkehs. This camping ground would be the most suitable for use if troops were landed in the westernmost of the two boat harbours described above. • Sanitation .—There is no scavenger class and no sanitation whatever. Mosquito curtains are a necessity at all seasons. The climate is reputed the best of any port in the Gulf. The summers are slightly hotter than Biisbire, but the winters are milder. Rain usually falls from November to February and averages about inches annually.62 Store Depots'—At least 25 store houses, situated in the vicj. nity of the landing stages and of average dimensions, 22 by 20 by 14 feet, would always be obtainable, and sufficient room to store some 200,000 bags of grain in all could be found. Some 30 40 shops near the water front are nearly always empty and could be used for storage purposes; average dimensions 25 by 8 by 12 feet. These store houses and shops are well made of stone and have water-proof roofs. Corrmnnirations .—In 1917 a small wireless station of the Indo-European Telegraph Department was established at Lingeh. It is in charge of two operators, and is situated just outside the town half a mile due north of the Persian Fort on the sea-shore. The station is in direct communication with Henjam Radio. For further details, see Chapter VIT. Water .—All sweet water is obtained from large hirleh the total number of which is 42 dependent on rainfall. The well water is indifferent. With the addition of pipes, a much larger area could be made available for water-supply. It should be noted that the water of the birkehs is only fit to drinlc if boiled or sterilised. Neglect to do this is the direct cause of the great prevalence of guineaworm among the in habitants of the town. Except in the case of a very small force landed soon after a heavy rainfall, distilling plant would be advisable. Population—This at present amounts to 12,000 souls, chiefly Arabs and Persians with about 800 Negroes locally known as SldTs, the descendants of slaves. Only Tper cent, of the fighting men are supposed to have arms, which are seldom produced except under the incitement of mullahs. . The y are a degenerate and cowardly race ; incapable of offer ing resistance to an enemy attacking their town. Three-quarters of the inhabitants are directly or indirectly in the pearl trade.

At least as far back as 1000 B.C., the ancestors of the Persians and Indians were an Aryan race originating in the country afterwards known as Bactria, from which they migrated. One stream swept south-east into India, another south-west into Persia, Plato describes the Persians as originally a nation of shepherds and herdsmen, occupying a rude country such as naturally fosters a hardy race of people, capable of supporting both cold and hardships, and, when needful, of enduring the toils of war. Over these ancient settlers during a long course of centuries swept wave after wave of conquering invaders, each of which left its mark on the original race. The result is the Persian of the present day, of whom those inhabiting the northern parts of the country natu rally show more of the characteristics of the invaders from Central Asia, while to the south-west the Arab element predo minates. The nomad mountain tribes are the only ones who have had a chance of preserving their individuality, though the people of Ears pride themselves on the purity of their origin, which is proved by their complexion and features. The Persian peasantry and nomad tribesmen are of good General Charac. physique, but townsfolk and most people of good family are fc&lt;ristic8 ' the reverse. The Persians are not now high-spirited and warlike; they are crushed by conquest and bad government, and their brains and manhood are being sapped by excessive consumption - 1 of opium, and by vice. They are not frugal, but like to eat and dress well, however poor they may be. Their best quality is their cheerfulness. Only a cursory study of Persian history is required to realise the lamentable lack, or at any rate the feebleness, of the popular spirit, and also the fact that Persia is not merely a house divided against itself, but a rickety structure, kept together by external pressure, which every kind of domestic discussion tends to rend to pieces. Wild semi-nomad tribes in every part of the kingdom, are ready at any moment to disown allegiance to the Central Government and can be restrained by nothing64 Firs. but force and fear. The mullds of the Shi ah religion are re- actionary and dread anything that may weaken their preroga tives or dispel the superstition of the masses ; they, therefore deprecate the spread of civil rights and liberties to their bond slaves. The governing and upper classes are all reactionanea and royalists, beimt steeped in corruption, and having, battened for centuries on such ill-gotten gains as an imqiutous system of government allowed them to squeeze out of the masses. The Persians are an emotional people, quick to seize upon a new idea or doctrine and their subtle active brains render them pecuh- arlv susceptible to the influence of any kind of sentimental or abstract teaching; hence a Persian crowd is easily manipulated bv a demagogue. So it follows that a few enthusiasts of the younger generation, who have imbibed western ideas of freedom and constitutional rights, experience little difficulty in excit ing an enthusiasm of popular feeling, at least momentary and spasmodic. Thus, during the nationalist movement, at one time a fanatical populace was clamouring for a constitution and abolition of hoary wrongs, and at another was acquiescing, almost without a'murmur, in the cannonading of its national assembly, or the arrival of foreign troops to restore order. Cha racteristics such as these are insufficient to bring about a success ful revolution, but afford a magnificent field for the machina tions of agitators and adventurers. The success of the cons titutional movement was largely due to the adroit use of such inflammable material by a few bold leaders (mostly aliens), who supplied the necessary courage, resolution and practical ability, which the Persian patriots lacked. As to any hopes that in the future Persia may grow strong and independent enough to conduct her own administration, with her own trained and proven leaders, two obstacles stand in the yvay. The first is the lamentable vanity so marked in the Persian character which precludes them seeking or ensuing a good example. Up to a point they may appreciate, or even imitate, what other nations have achieved. The other obstacle is the reactionary Shfah religion, with its jested interests, its fanaticism, and its hatred of progress and modem enlightenment. (a) Fdrs Fdrs .—Xo census of Pars has ever been taken and there are no figures of any kind from which it is possible to deduce a reliable estimate of the population : the figures given herein are b house relati estim has b villag per tc T1 out as Thi dated when aggera of theii Tin Th&lt; (1 (2 MC37Gare re* ; rcroga- I irefore, r bond onaries ittened I stem of k.

In making such : estimates five souls have been reckoned per house, a figure which has been found in practice to be fairly reliable Mhen°applied to villages. Xomad-tribes have likewise been reckoned at five per tent. The total of the nomadic and semi-nomsdic tribos works out as follows r— Qashqal Families. .. 33,(H5 j|R Khamseh .. 17,330 Boir Ahmadi .. 6,100 Mamassani 2,700 Dushmanziarl 2,000 Lashani ... 1,500 Mishmast 300 Sundry minor tribes .. 12,030 Total .. 75,005 families or say, 3,75,025 souls. The above figures and all estimates of tribal strengths a v e dated before the influenza epidemic of October-Noverr.ber, 1918, when the tribal losses were very heavy. It would be no ex- aggeration to say that the nomad tribes of Ears lost 2D per cent, of their total numbers during the epidemic. The sedentary population numbers about 500,000. The most densely populated districts are:— (1) The coastal strip from Dilam to the mouth of the Mand river, commercially and to a large extent adminis tratively dependent on Bushire, with a population of over 100,000. (2) The country north, north-east, oast and south-east of Shiraz within a radius of 60 miles of that city, with MC37GSBCG Arabs. Lars. rtn estimated population, including that of the capital, of 140,000 made up as follows Shiraz district 30.000 40.000 1,000 Shiraz town .. •' Abraj Ardakan 6,000 12,500 Arsinjan Baiza • • .. *' 0,000 Kam Firuz Kamln * 4 3,500 2,000 Kavar Khafrak 2,500 4,0&lt;)0 Kurbal 10,000 Mahin 2,500 Marvdasht 10,000 Sarvistan ,. 8,000 Total 140,000 Setting aside such an abnormal occurrence as the influenza epidemic, there is no indication that the population is rnereas- i n &lt;r ; on the contrary, everything tends to show that it is either stationary or decreasing. The inhabitants of the provinces of Fars and Laristan are of several quite distinct types. Along the coast and for some | distance inland, from Kangan eastwards, are colonies of Arabs | from the opposite coast, some of them comparatively recent arrivals, some of long standing. The population of the Shibkfih p r ,its is predominantly Arab. These Arabs arc mostly Sunnis with a few Shi’ahs. they are bilingual and are gradually being absorbed by the stronger Persian element around them ; they keep to their Arab dress, and, amongst themselves, to their own speech, and it is plain from their features and other physical characteristics that they are of a different racial type from their Persian neighbours. In the Haiat Paud district and further east will also be found colonies of Arabs, mostly Sunnis, with a few Shi’ahs from Hin- dijan. The population of the coast is however for the most part Per nan, but of a type quite distinct from that met with in Central Pers grea are i Kari prof&lt; num woul ship, gunfc usefi T With They ment by d nor if the f of SOI physi 0 Jabbi Arab the 7 anciei all ali U this is persoi villagi them for tb apply Sarvis Shiraz Lur o savage Th again That c of mi? and inPersia They are Lurs, not unwarlike, of a good physique, and' great agriculturists in the inland districts. Those from the ports are much m demand as coolies in ports even as far a held as Karachi and Basra. They are skilled sailors and fishermen professions which maploy a substantial proportion of their number; and, when trained and subjected to discipline they would be in many respects superior to lascarsfor work on board- ship. Ihe crews of the Customs launches and of the Persian gunboat “ Persepolis ” are drawn from this source, and seem a useful and handy lot of men. • , Th L ^'l hqai ” omads are of Turkish origin and monopolize with the Khamseh the lion’s share of political influence in Pars They are sufficiently powerful to disregard the Persian Govern ment, if it suits them to do so, but have been prevented hitherto by dissensions among their chiefs from showing a united front • nor is there any sign that this state of things is likely to alter in the future. Physically they are perhaps the finest of the tribes of south-west Persia, except the MamassanT, who are said to be physically fine men. Q&amp;shq&amp;l! t u?- ^ Kha T Seh 1 ’ ° f five tribes onI 3- two &gt; Shaibani and Khamseh Jabbareh, are of undoubted Arab origin and form the so-called Arab tribe. They aggregate 15,000 tents and are immigrants of the 7th Century A. D. from Arabia; they still retain their ancient tongue. The origin of the remaimng tribes is doubtful: all alike are marauders. Lastly comes the sedentary population ; north of Shiraz Persians, this is predominantly of old Persian stock ; lacking enterprise, personal courage and the power of co-operation, these wretched villagers have ever been the prey of the nomads, who so despoil them of their livestock and crops as to make it almost impossible for them to keep body and soul together; these remarks also apply, though in less degree, to the population of the Fasa, Sarvistan, Kavar and Khafr districts. South of Jahrum and Shiraz the villagers are more virile, with a strong admixture of Lur or nomad blood, and in Laristan the villagers are not less savage and predatory than the nomads. The populations of the towns of Bushire and Shiraz are again well-defined types, and recognized as such all over Persia, t hat of Bushire is much mixed : Arabs, Persians, Lurs, and tribes of mixed blood, such as Behbehanis, have settled in the town and intermarried, forming a peculiar type; they wear peculiar f2G8 Coastal region. dress into which the kulah does not enter. The population numbers about 15,000. Their well-bred manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and they are inclined to be uncivil to foreigners though less so now than xormerly. The townspeople of Shiraz are said to ce of a hst. mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, but it is difiicult to fix upon any feature as predominating or distinctive of them The town population includes a certain number of Armenians, Shira/Js;pe notably given to philosophical speculation, and the Babi movement has found widespread support in the town. The tribes which inhabit the coastal region and are known by the names of the various districts they inhabit have oeen separate entities for centuries; they are clans in the sense of the Scottish clans before the 18th century, some districts having feuds with others lasting generations, others having traditional friendships with certain of their neighbours, retaliating as a tribe any raid or injury done by an aggressor. In the better organised districts the hereditary chiefs or Khans direct the inter-tribal and external policy of the tribe so that much depends on the sentiments and capacity of the Khans. As regards the local interests of the chiefs and occupations of the tribesmen and peasants, the districts fall into three natural categories :— («' The northern districts, Liravl, Haiat Baud, Rfid Hilleh and Shabankarch are piimarily occupied in agricul ture and possess large flocks towards their mountain frontiers, wherfe grazing is carried on during the spring and summer. The^. also have three busy little ports in Bandar Dilam, Bandar Rig and Gana- veh, the first named serving for the supply of the inland market at Behbehan and the Kuhgalu tribes, the other two for that of the nomad tribes across the mountains. The Khan’s incomes are derived from the taxation of cultivation and certain port dues, etc. The Khan of Shabankareh has the advantage oi administering the river-irrigated district of ZTa. which produces valuable quantities of dates, cotton, etc. (5) There is also considerable, though less, cultivation of grain in Borazjfm, Chahkiitah and Angali. Far the must important interest of the Khans of tluso69 districts and of Daliki now lies in the high road for trade into the interior of Persia which passes through the-r villages. r I hey levy a rich income from tolls on caravans using this highway. The Khan of Angali in addition has a strong interest in the tolls he collects at Shlf from goods transhipped from Bushire for Shiraz. In this respect his interest runs counter to that of the Khan of Chahkiitah, for the more caravan traffic that goes by the land route, the less toll money comes to the Khan of Angali. (') 1 lie third category in the coast region is represented by 1 angistan and Dasht, the latter a most ex tensive district stretching for many miles across the mountain chain. Tangistan has always had a heterogeneous tribal population, turbulent and warring among themselves, village against village. It is not very fertile, the date groves are not very productive, and, though the villages round Gurgk grow much vegetable produce, the chief income of the Chiefs lies in the fruit gardens of Khalvia in the hills and in the Ahram date gardens. Donkey traffic for Firuzabad and Shiraz is blackmailed to some extent by the Khan, but his chief source of wealth has been tire arms traffic. Dashti on the other hand is a vast grain-growing district with a river flowing through it. It also possesses extensive date cultiva tion. Here the Khans have no caravan traffic to batten on. From being well governed and tranquil, the district has in the last forty years fallen into a state of chaos and has become divided under many petty village headmen, most of whom are at feud with one another. Tn a!! eases the Khans resent any interference likely to im pair their sole control in their districts or over their tribesmen The methods adopted however differ. The Khans of Haiat Baud, Rud Hilleh and Liravi are members of one family and work in close co operation and consultation under the leader ship of Haider Khan of Ha at Baud, who resides at Bandar Rig, with the Khans of Angali also allied by marriage and largely under their influence. Haider Khan and his relatives make a point of paying regularly the revenue due by their districts to the Pemian Government, and of Leaping very good order70 jNom&amp;d Tritea. and security, besides giving some support to the local ( ustoms authorities,' preventing smuggling and maintaining correct relations with the Governors. By fulfilling these obligations they consider they give no legitimate pretext for further inter ference by the Governors and are entitled to manage their own internal and external affairs. The Khan of Shabankaieh and Zira has also paid the revenue due fairly regularly, but he is less astute than the above named and his districts are often in some disorder as a result of bad management. The Khans of Borazjun, Tangistan and Dashti have not been in the habit for some years of paying their very considerable taxes, and, relying on the powerlessness of the Government authorities, have oiten flatly declined to do so. Chahkutah has behaved in a similar manner. Tangistan and DashtT are always in the bad books of the Persian Government. As regards the relations of the Chiefs to one another Llravi, Haiat Baud, Rud Hilleh, Angall and Shabankareh have been on peaceful terms with one another for a number of years. The Khans of Shabankareh and Zira have for many years been at feud with the Khan of Borazjun, while the Khans of Daliki, being allies of Borazjun, support the latter in this feud. Angall has a standing feud with Chahkfitah, which in turn is hostile to Tangistan. Tangistan is divided against itself and has a long standing enmity with Haiat Baud, while the Bashtls for the most part are on bad terms with the TangistanI village headmen. All the Khans of the littoral, even his allies of necessity, dislike and distrust Borazjun. HaiSt B5ud, Riid Hilleh, Liravl, Angall, Shabankareh and Zira have been consistently friendly to British interests, while Borazjun, Tangistan, Chahkutah and Baliki may be expected to show hostility. Of the Bashtls some headmen during the Great War threw in their lot with the Tangistan s, while others adopted a friendly attitude towards the British. The Nomad Tribes of Fdrs. The principal nomad tribes of Pars are the Qashqal and Khamseh tribes, the former Turks, the latter partly Arabs of mixed origin. Of secondary importance are the Mamassani, Lashani, Mishmast, Bolr Ahmadi and Bushmanziari. who take no part in provincial politics, but, like the others, indulge freely in highway robbery. Ail these tribes, whose total num*71 % bcrs togctlier with a number of smaller and less important ones, are estimated at something under 77,000 tents, are described in detail below. Always lawless, and seldom completely under the control of the Central Government, the nomads of Fars were nevertheless seldom a souspc of serious anxiety to the Governor-General of • Fars, until the last decade of the 19th Century : for they were ill- armed, and in consequence unable to withstand Government troops under proper leadership: they even furnished military forces to Government; above all, their forces were uneducated and disunited. Khumseh .—The Khamseh (A rabx-Rvc) tribes are Klwmwti. (1) The Arabs. (2) The ’Ainalu. (3) The Baharlu. (4) The Baser!. (5) The Nafar. The Nafar tribe originally numbered some 1,000 families' but these are now to a large extent dispersed and settled in BakhtiarT country. Part of the tribe remains however, and is still considered as a unit of the Khamseh tribes. Of the above tribes, the Arabs and Baser! alone are migratory. The ’Ainalu, Baharlu and Nafar are of Turkish origin, as also are the Baser?, with the exception of one tbeh or sub-tribe the Turbur Choharbuncheh, whose language is Persian. The Arabs are, as their name implies, of Arabic origin and came originally / from Najd and Oman. The headship of the Khamseh is now hereditary in the Qawami family. The following is an approximate correct statement of the strength of the Khamseh tribes in April, 1918. Arabs Ainalu Baharlu Baser! Nafar .. .. Families. 10,130 1,200 1,200 4.500 300 Total .. 17,3300 72 Arabs. Ain&amp;lQ. With perhaLS the exception of the Ainalu and Baser!, the main characteristic of the Khamsch tribesmen is a propensity for robbery. Several small sub sections of tribes make their living by agriculture or caravan work. With these exceptions every Arab is at heart a robber and loses no opportunity of indulging this propensity. So marked is their tendency in this direction that their own chiefs are in many cj^es unable to restrain them. No tribe in Persia bears the same unsavoury- reputation for petty robbery as the Khamseh Arabs. (а) The Arabs .—The Arabs came originally from Najd. Oman, and Yemen in the seventh century, and with a few ex ceptions retain their nomad habits. Those who came to Pars and are now known as the Khamseh Arabs are of nomadic habit, their summer quarters being near Bavanat, Qunquri, Sarchahan. etc., and their winter quarters in the Bulak-eh- Sabeh, i.e. • Fasa, Darab, Furg, Jahrum, Jiyum, and as far south-east as Tang-i-TMlan. They ^re divided into the two main branches, (a) the Jazbareh, and (6) the Shaibani, the former having originally 28 sub-tribes, and the latter 23. The Jabbareh Arabs are also known as the Arab KuchT. The former number approximately 6,630 families and the latter 4,500. They originally spoke pure Arabic, but this is now much corrupted, and is a mixture of Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Lurl. The one exception is theTurburCheharbuncheh, (BuzsurkhI, Jelodari and Lur) who speak Persian. An approximate list of the Arab tribes showing their summer and winter habitat, and their routes of migration will be found in Appendix A. (б) The ’Ainalu .—The ’AinSlu came originally from Turkis- tan and settled in Pars in the thirteenth century. Their strength is variously estimated at from 800 to 2,000 families. One thousand two hundred is an approximately correct estimate in all probability. They were at one time migratory with their yaildq, or summer quarters round Ramgird and Marvdasht. They have now however become sedentary and live south west of a line from Sarvistan, Fasa and Mahdevan, the majority bemg south-east of Fasa. They speak Turk!. A small section (the Bmdarhi) lives in the Diideh valley about 30 miles east of bhirfiz They have settled down to a peaceful agricultural ou®’- Tha Dudeh valle y &gt; the ]. rincipal market garden of bbiraz. °73 (fe' The present Kalantar of the ’Ainalu is Najaf QiiJi Khan.

(c) The Baharlt .—The Baharlu are of Turkish origin and uahurlu, came to Persia and settled in Ears in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They were originally migratory and had their summer quarters in the districts of RUmj rd and Marvdasht and their winter quarters near Sarvistfin and PSrab. They have now for many years been sedentary and live on the banks of the Darab river. They are said to number about 1,200 families. The tribe is rich in horses and appears to have a rooted objec tion to undertaking any journey or military operations on foot. Until recently they were noted robbers, but in 1917 the Qawam inflicted severe punishment on them and this has had a salutory effect on them. They speak Turk’. {(1) The Bdserl. —The Baserl believe themselves to be descen' Baseri.; dants of the Basra Arabs. They speak a corrupt form of Arabic. The tribe probably consists of 4,500 families, thouerh estimates vary considerably. They are not ordinarily addictc .1 to robbery. They own large numbers of transpoit animals which they ply for hire. This is their chief source of livelihood and it is in all probability on account of this that they do not migrate far. With the exception of the Vaisi section their summer and winter quarters are all within a radius of about 50 miles of Shiraz city and close to the main caravan routes.74 They are divided into main sections, (a) the Vaisi, and (b) the Allah MirzaT, the sub-divisions and habitat of which are given in Appendix B. is now insignificant and consists of not more than 2,300 tents. It lives in the Gerash district and is sedentary. tion of Arab tribes, who, having no Kalantars of their own, were originally contracted to one Haji Jaffar Beg by the Qawam-ul- Mulk, who headed the Khamseh between 1820 and 1855. They originally numbered some 10—15 tribes, large and small, living in various parts of the Khamseh country. They have rapidly declined, and there are now only a few families left. There are a few in the buluk of Sarvistan who are known as Zoghalt, their means of livelihood being principally the burning and transport of zoghdl or charcoal. There is another small isolated group of families in and around Qasr Dasht and another living in Sal (Shiraz). These are engaged in cultivation. In some of the larger Khamseh tribes a few families may st'll be found, and the Qarai, Ardbiz, TattI and Tarbor are also said to have belonged to the Moqata’jat. Qdshqdi. —There is a tradition that, when the Turkoman tribes during the Mongol invasions reached the province of Persian ’Iraq, a band of them fied and settled in Pars, and that the Turkomans called this band Qdshqdi, i e„ ‘ those who ran away ’ (from [qdchmak = to flee). Changes in pronunciation after- wards converted this appellation into Qdshqdi. The langu age of the Qashqai has remained Turk! t« this day and the inhabitants of Pars usually speak of them as “ Turk.” In course of time the original band became divided into two parts because a large section retained the nomadic habit of migration in spring and autumn. The one part kept the Tur koman appellation of Khalarh, the other was called CKUhnaT Nafar (e) The Nafar. —The Nafar are of Turkish origin. The tribe Moqata’jat.

It would appear that the Qashqa: // does not number more than 30,000 families. They themselves reckon an average of 5 souls per family, giving a total of 175,000 persons for the whole tribe. The above figures include the Ilyats alone. To this must be added the numbers of villages which come under the jurisdiction of the Ilkhoni. These probably number some 20—25.000 families Tim Ilkhani therefore exercises control over 30,000 families of Ilyats and 20—25,000 villagers in the Sarhad and Garmslr, making a total of 50—55,000 families. A very large portion of Pars is in the hands of, or connected with, the Qashqais, and the settled population of those districts and the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe form a large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many cases the settled villagers detest the tribesmen. The Qashqais are nomadic, not only by traditional custom, but also because their tribal wealth and food supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the hot regions before the grazing in the valleys has been dried up by the hot spring sun of Southern Pars, and of seeking fresh pastures on the high plateaus of Northern Pars, is imperative, while the climate of the Sarhad is too bitter during the winter months, and far more firewood can be obtained in the hills of the Garmsir. Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool and hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents and covering, and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. The poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. Those sections of the tribes, which possess a large number ' of horses and animals, sow each winter in the valleys of the Gar’mslr which they are in the habit of visiting each autumn, and the harvested grain is ready for their consumption on their return in the autumn. Thus the wide valley of Farashband is almost entirely cultivated by the Shishbuluki and some 200— 300 tons of grain are probably raised there every spring. Of late years also the chiefs of the Qashqai, and, in imitation of them, some of the Khans of the tirehs har e acquired, seized or bought large properties in the Qashqai districts or biditk of the south.76 This factor in the life of the tribe has great influence on their regular migrations backwards and forwards ; some of these properties, for instance, raise large quantities of rice, a staple article of food. They are now one of the richest of the nomad tribes of Persia and the best armed, their proximity to the sea coast in winter having enabled them to make large purchases of rifles and ammunition on favourable terms. They have seldom come into direct conflict with the Persian Government, as their proximity to Shiraz and Isfahan, their large flocks, extensive landed property, and lengthy migrations have always made them peculiarly vulnerable. The Qashqai—in their winter quarters at any rate—do not camp in the open valleys ; one does not see a hundred or more tents pitched in one place, and indeed one might travel many miles through the heart of the Qashqai country without noticing an encampment. Their custom is to select secluded valleys and ravines on the hill side, which are to air extent protected from the winter weather and also near water, and in such spots four, ten, or twenty tents may be seen together. The enormous extent of country occupied by the Qashqals and their distribu tion in sparse units,widely scattered over extremely mountainous country, not only prevent the tribes from accumulating in any one place in more than a small fraction of their real strength, but also would seem to make any operations against the tribe or certain sections of it a difficult matter. Moreover, in many cases the tribe in its winter quarters is divided and settled in distinct portions, far apart from one another. They resemble generally the Lur nomads of south-west Persia, but their language is a dialect of Turki, though most tribesmen understand Persian fairly well. In appearance they compare favourably with their Lur compatriots : they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than Bakht.’arls, and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they seem more orthodox and less supersti tious than their Lur neighbours. Ihe migrations of the Qashqai differ little from those of other nomad tribes. Their principal transport animals are camels and donkeys : mules, are scar ce and only used by the Khans, and cattle are not extensively employed; they are probably the onl y tribe in South Persia, except the Arab, who use camel* for the purpose.

About the vernal equinox, or Nauroz, they commence to strike their black tents and move slowly north ; they leave their northern pastures rather before the middle of September, and come back to their old camping grounds in the south. Their summer quarters, known os Spirhad, are near the northern boundary of Pars, west of Qumisheh and Ya/.d-i-Khast, and reach to the eastern slope of the Kuh-i-Danna (the Kuhgalu tribes being on the south-west of this range); their winter quarters are in the Garmslr or hot regions of bars, ranging from the vicinity of Behbehan to near bar, but never south of the range of mountains bordering the const-line, that is to say, generally, more than 40 miles inland as the crow flies. The principal route is that adopted by the Darashuri, Kashkuli and others, who, coming from Behbehan and the Mabur-i-Mailatun district respectively, strike the Bushire- Shiraz post road in the neighbourhood of Kazarun and follow the general trend of this route as far as L'asht-i-Arjan and Khan- i-Zin an, whence they either proceed via Chehar-i-Kahdar, and cross the Shiraz plain to Jlyum and Baiza, or more dir ect to Aidakan. From the latter point they disper se by various routes to their summer quarters. A few tribes previously used the Tang-i- Allah-o-Akbar, north of Shiraz, brrt this is not usual now, the whole it keeping well to the west of Shiraz. Tribes coming from Galehdar, ’Alamarvdafcht, Afzar, etc., generally pass through Chehar-i-Rahdar on their Way up-country. It is rarely that the tilths change the course of their migra tion and, any deviation from the customary lines being difficult for the larger' tribes, to block their upward path is not only the easiest, but the most effective way of putting pressure upon any particular tribe, or on the tribe as a whole. The only divisions which are of any practical importance and which may become, on occasion, political entities are the Da ra- shurl, Kashkuli, Shishbuluki, and larslmadan. The supp ort of these tribes, or at least their neutrality, is necessary to' any ilkhanl. The migration of the Ilkhanl and his Amalch, or household troops, is shown in Appendix D. Generally speaking the downward migration of the whole II converges on Baiza and Juyum to the north of Shiraz, and then78 Qaahqfu Tribal Sections.

The route of migration may slightly change from year to year if the supply question necessitates it. The general route however rarely changes. As far as possible the tribes avoid the main roads and villages, and camp in such places as pro vide good grazing for their numerous flocks. The date of commencement of the northward migration dep- ends upon the crops which have been sown in the Garms'.r and which must be harvested before the whole of the tribe can leave for the Sarhad. Thus, though the first tents are struck shortly after Nmiroz, it may be anything from 10 to 40 days after this date when the last tribesman moves. Details of the migration of each tribe are given in the details of the various sub-tribes. Tribal Sections. —It is a well-known tradition that the Qash- qai were from the beginning 44 clans, or tirehs. Some of these have disappeared and others have dwindled to a few tents. Some bodies of the Qashqai have gone over to Bakhtiari country, or in a less degree to the Khamseh tribes in times of stress, while some of the smaller branches have become merged in the larger. On the other hand many branches are to day 7 composed of elements in which little of the original Qashqai stock can be traced. A list of the tribal sections is given in Appendix D. (a) The Darashurls, came originally from Turkistan and settled in the bul&gt;~'k of Garmabad in the ‘ Darashur ’ valley. In point of view of strength and tribal wealth the Darashurls are the first of the Qashqai tribes. They number 3,500—4,000 families. The present chief is Aiyaz Kihka. Their Garmsir is east and south-east of Behbehan and their Sarhad in Vardasht and Garmabad (near Simarum). Their migration is via Sar Abnaniz, Marg, Shahpur, the Kazarun district, thence vid the Shahi road to Khani-Zinian, to Kiidian, Haftbarm, Tang-i-Kullar, Baiza, Kam Firuz, Dizkurd, Khusru Shirin, Hanna, Garmabad and Vardasht. They should arrive in the Sarhad about May 16th, but the last of the tribe does not leave the Garmsir until the shxitvi crops have been harvested, i.e., about 30 days after the Nauroz (March 21st). These crops are spwn on arrival in. the Garmsir at the beginning of the winter.

They have a reputation as ultra- strict Shi ahs with a reverence for the Kuran which leads them to abstain from taking the oath upon it. Part of this tribe is sedentary at Slmakan and part is attached to the IlkhSni’s Amaleh. (3) The Ghallehzan Michak are a tribe of 100 families which was formerly attached to the Ubegi’s Amaleh, but now attached to the Ilkhani s. The total strength of the Ghallehzans is thus about 1 200 families. ’ (/) The Bulll (or Buttt), consists of three sub-divisions m « Bull! Hashem KhSnT, (2) Bull! Zirak, and (3) Bulli Hail Tahmas * Khani, (known as the Kahlu). J ^anmas (1) The Bulb Hashem Khani are a tribe of some 500 families who have for the last 7 or 8 years been sedentary at Galehdar and Alamarvdasht. (2) The Bulll Zirak are a small tribe of some 100 families^ mostly occupied in agriculture. The tribe is attached to the llkhani’s Amaleh. (3) The Bulli Haji Tahmas Khani are a tribe of about 250 families, whose Garmslr is in Arba’eh, Hangam, Piruzftbad and FarSshband, and their Sarhad at Khiisru Shirin. They migrate rid FIruzafcad, Khwajai, Siakh, Kushan, Juyum, Baiza Kam Rruz, Dizkurd to Khusru Shirin. The total strength of the Bullis is thus about 850 families. (g) The Fafi Khdnis (or Safi Ahdnlus), originally migrated from Luristan, and settled in Pars. There are about 600 families in the tribe, which is famous for bravery and addicted to rob bery. The tribal Garmsir is from south-west of Farashband to the borders of Pashti, while the Sarhad is in Dizkurd, KhusrQ Shirin, boh Deh and Bud Khaneh Safid. They migrate vid Firuzabad, Chinar, Fariab, Jfiyum (or sometimes vid Khwajai and SiSkh to Juyiim*), Baiza, Kam Firuz, to Khusru Shirin. Safi KMnli. (h) The Qarachehi, was the first tribe of the Qashqai II to Qarachelli ' migrate from Turkistan. The tribe numbers 500 families. It has its Garrnsir in the Farashband and Jirreh districts and its Sarhad at Kuhmair and Mourak in the Padina district.

Mamassani. The name' Mamassani is a contraction of the name Muhammad Hassani, and it is said that one Muhammad Hass an founded the tribe. It is not known who bo was, but some of the tribesmen say, he came originally from Arabia, while others maintain that he came from Dashtistan. The whole of thejr country now belongs to Muin-ut-Tuj jar. The MamassanTs are said to be of mixed origin, having come from Behbehan, Pusht-i-Kiih, Arabistan and as far north as the Bo'r Ahmad! country. The tribe has three main divisions, called (1) Bakesh, (2) Javidi (or Towi), and (3) Rustam after the three origiu d chiefs. As these sections became stronger they wbtv again sub-divided. r The Mamafsanl country ,is bounded on the north by the district of B r .sht, on the south by the Dushmanzian country, on the east by Ardakan, and on the west by Marg and Gurspld. They speak a dialect of.Lur -Persian which differs but little from ordmary colloquial Persia^. The Kalantars and Kadkhu- das all speak correct Persian in addition. Like the Qashqai the Mamassani is dark skinned. Above the average height and of excellent physique, he is a lover of sports and all outdoor pursuits. Formerly a notorious robber cb.83 he has of recent years adopted a mote peaceful agricultural life. The Mamassani country is on the whole prosperous and well- governed. The Mamassani rs sedentary witliin his own boundaries. The Rustam and JavidI sections move a short distance to villages which have the advantage of a slightly better climate during the summer. There is however no organised tribal migration. The religion is orthodox Shi’ah, and the tribe has a reputation for bcsng meticulous in its religious observances. The tribe numbers about 13,500 persons, of which the Rustam contributes 6,000 souls, the Bakesh 4,000, and the JavidI 3,500. The sub-sections of the tribe are given in Appendix E. Lashdni .—The Lashanis were until 1874 a sub-tribe of the Qashqai II. They are divided into two sections both sedentary, the one living Khafrak and the other in Abadeh-i-Tashk. They number about 1,500 families. The Lashanis have for many years been renowned as the most daring robber tribe in Ears, their expeditions taking them as far as Khorasan. The tribe formerly lived almost solely on the proceeds of robbery, which had become so fixed a habit with the young men of the tribe that the chiefs had very little hold over them. In the autumn of 1917 however a column of Indian troops severely punished them, and destroyed all their forts. Since this time robbery has practically ceased, and the tribe is now settling down to an agricultural life. During the summer months the tribesmen live in tente, which are however pitched near the houses occupied by them in the wipter. The sub-tribes are as follows :— Khafrakls :—Total farrulies 500. Banusar. Bazwand. Khalllwand. Tutaki. Shah wand. Abadeh-i-Tashkis Total families 1,000. Iriwand. Na j mu dd imva nd. Abdullah wand. Yazdanwand. Bahmanwand. Aul id Sheikh AH.

Tlie following three tirehs are also now attached to the Bah- mSnwand, though they pay revenue direct to Government (1) Molhak, (2) Tolamaki, and (3) Kushkaki. Mishmast .—The Mishmasts are an indigenous tribe, but live almost entirely in tents on the Arsinjan plain round Arsinjan itself. Certain sections of the tribe occasionally take up their quarters on the Saadatabai and Saidun plains, more especially in winter. Two villages within 5 miles of Arsinjan, Fijan and Panlran, are reported to be their headquarters. They, like the LashanI, are great robbers by nature, and formerly used to join the Lashanis in their expeditions. They are also on good terras with the Cheharrahi, Tutaki (robber tribes in the Bavanat district), and Feraghehl (an offshoot of the Bakhtiarl), living in the Abrkuh district. They have however not been to the fore in raiding expeditions since the Lashanis were punished. B ar Ahmadl .—The Boir Ahmadl tribe is the most important of the Chehar Buncheh group of the KuhgaM tribes, which also includes the Churam, Nuyi and Bavl, all of which are considered to belong to the Pusht-i-Kuh division of the Knhgalu, though settlements of the Boir Ahmadl are to be found round Behbehan. With the exception of tho Mulla Qobad section, which is sedentary round Sisakht, tho Bar had and Garmsir of this tribe are :—- Sarhad. —Tal-i-Khusru, Sar Rud, Sisakht, Chinar Dasht-i Rum, Safld Dar, Kuh-i-Dil and Vazak. Gar mar .—In the district east of Behbehan and north-west of Mamassani country, in SunkarSbad, Kalat, Deh Dasht and Suk-i-Changalvar. In 1917 their strength was stated to be as follows :— Families.

The Babls are loathed by other Persians and in conse quence prove useful as agents. The tenets of Babism are no clergy, no prayers, only dogmatic belief in Cod and His mani festations, whether by Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, etc., or by Baba ‘ Ullah.90 CHAPTER IV. Climate and Health. General, dr si riptioo. The principal characteristic of the climate of Soul hern Persiaespcciallv inland, are its intense dryness, a most valuable rrfor Sraye-purposes, as it means that rveevUs and other insects requiring moisture are practically non-existent. The seasons follow the European plan of having the rams during “nter, and from about April to November one can usually count on having cloudless skies. The rainfa is not a heavy one but the soil, especially in the Shiraz valley, is, as a rule, •as tenacious of moisture as the air is is unpleasant after rain if it has been at all ln ^ f land valleys the summer heat varies with the ATtifhRe and m^y be taken to be that of the hill stations in India of from 1,000 to 1*500 feet less altitude. This is probably due to the bare rooky hills which are always close at hand, to the lack of ram, anc o the absence of trees. The end of August usually brings the end of the summer heat accompanied almost invanablv bv a marked drop of temperature. The rains begip in No vender and at the higher levels of from 4,000 feet and upwards some snow may be looked for from Christmas Day till the end of March. ^ in seldom falls in the tropical Indian fashion, but rather m lighter European showers. The extent and nature of the country of Persia is such that it offers, like India, every variety of climate and every variation of heat and cold. The climate of Persia may be roughly divided into three periods :— (a) In the Carm sir and on the shores of the littoral the heat in summer and autumn is intense and the ports become hotbeds of malaria and are almost insupportable for Europeans. During these sea sons it is perferable to march by night, even as late as October. (b) In winter cold winds prevail ; and in the spring when the heated air of the deserts in the south-east oegins to rise, a strong north and westerly wind sweeps down the valleys from the mountains of Kurdistan.

In spring there is more rain, but seldom sufficient to interfere seriously with movements, except when, oiving to the pre sence of mountains, small rivers and streams, usually nearly, if not quite, dry, become flooded so as to be quite impassable. There is less rain in autumn, but Indians and Persians are liable to fevers, probably oiving to the great difference in temperatures by day and night. (a) Fdrs. General .—Extremes of heat and cold wdll be found in sum. F3rs. mer and winter respectively in the province. The main road td Isfahan traverses plains 7,000' above sea level, and deep with snow in winter for days together, the temperature falling to as low as 15° F. in -yinte 1, while in summer there is a maximum shade temperature of 90° F. In consequence, during December and January it is frequently almost impassable to caravans, especially as the plains, marshy at all times, are dedp in mud, consequent upon heavy rains, which commence about the middle of November and may be expected at intervals till th© beginning of May. Snow falls at 5,000 and above from 1st December onwards. On the passes between Shiraz and Kazarfm it may lie for as long as three weeks, but, as a rule, not more than ten days ; at such times the road is practically impassable, • On the other hand in the coastal areas it is intensely hot from May to September, while in the winter the cold is not excessive. The nights are cool, and there is a remarkable diffe rence between the day- and night temperatures in the hottest months. Shiraz .—Rain may be expected between November 21st Shir&amp;z. and April 15th, with occasional showers from the latter date to May Blsit. Rain rarely falls more than three days in succes- aion. Snow may be expected at any’ time between December 15th and April 1st, but rarely after that date. It seldom lies for more than a day on the plain. The nights are often intensely cold between January 1st and the middle or end of March. A minimum temperature of H’F had been recorded in January.92 Heat, at and above 5,000', begins about the end of June and lasts till the end of August, when there is always a marked fall in temperature. Even during the hottest weather the nights are generally cool. It is well to sleep in the open air if possible from May to October ; dew falls from the middle of September onwards in the plain above 3,000, and, later, below this altitude. The best season .for moving troops is from 1st April to end of May and from middle of September to middle of No\ ember, but it is possible to move troops over the main routes all the year round. there se there is climate in winte the prei The the dim (D ( 2 ) There is in Shiraz an utter absence of sanitation or any organized svstem of drainage, each house having its ovn badly constructed cesspool, cleared out at the will of tire individual, thus rendering the whole sub-soil saturated with refuse matter, The water itself is t ood, but, owing to a bad system of transport ation into the town by means of qa»dis, which are in some sec tions open, it is easily infected and during an epidemic prac tically out of control within the city walls. Considering the in sanitary condition of the town with its badly-planned and crowd ed houses, dirty, narrow streets, uncontrolled water-supply and absence of any system of drainage, Shiraz is singularly free from epidemics of specific diseases : the periodic (usually annual) January epidemics of diphtheria, small-pox, enteric, chicken-pox and known tc measles do not cause a large mortality. These usually occur and 15th either jn spring or autumn, with dysentery somewhat severe during the height of the summer. Epidemics of cholera occurat intervals of a decade or more. The last epidemic, of 1^04, j 0 ’ C( was, in comparison with that of former years, very severe, the mortality being probably not less than 5,000. The specific infectious diseases—typhus : rubella : intermittent, scarlet, dengue and yellow fever : beri beri : plague: hydrophobia, ano actinous cases—are practically unknown.

A cattle trough and stand pipe for filling drinking water carts exist on the road adjacent to the tank. A pipe line is laid to the buildings occupied as Regimental Headquarters and Station Hospital (vide Sketch Map).. There is a covered in reservior built of stone and cement some 40 yards from the easternmost jetty at New Customs {vide Map). The capacity of this reservoir is 120,000 gallons and was u ed for the storage of drinking water brought in steamers for the use of troops in the early days of the Striking Force in 1918.

Yazd is so situated that none of the disagreeable effects of damp are felt. The water is not found at less than 200 feet below the surface and the climate is very dry. The winds come down from the north and east, in spring and summer, with great- force, bringing such sandstorms, that the place becomes as dark as night; while great desiccating heat waves burn up everything in their way. The quantity of sand in the town has a good effect on the sewage system. During the summer heat, say the middle of June to about the end of August, life in tents in the plains in the day time would be almost unbearable, and it would be necessary to protect animals from the direct rays of the sun ; the nights, on the other hand, are tolerably cool. The plains are particularly barren and little or no shade could be obtained from trees; there are, however, large gardens in the vicinity of Yazd, where ample shade could be found. In the valleys of the mountains to the west of Yazd, and at Taft, a place about 16 miles also to the west, which is a summer resort for the inhabitants, trees are numerous. From Yazd to Taft there is a good carriage road, and roads to the valleys beyond are not difficult for mules, donkeys, and horses. During the whole of the winter, it ■would be possible to live in tents in the plains ; but it would be very trying and some means of heating them would be necessary. Transport animals would have to bo sheltered from the cold, especially during the night. From the beginning of April to the end of May, and from the middle of September to the end of November, would be the best time for being under canvas, and, except for occasional sandstorms, the weather would leave nothing to be desired.

I n the mountains 30 miles to the west it is cool during the day in the summer and chilly at night. All parts of this district in the plains arc similar in climate ; hut where there are trees and water, it is several degrees cooler. When the weather is cloudy at Yazd, there is generally snow or rain falling on the mountains. In the plains the actual rainfall is very little. The snowfall is not worth mentioning as it melts almost immediately, but remains all the year round in sheltered spots on the mountains, and thus supplies the city with snow during the hot season In this district, as in Isfahan also, the ground, being more or less sandy, quickly dries up after rain or snow; the roads are always open and the movement of troops would never be restricted from this cause. I: 'i (c) Lariit.au. The climate of Laristan is trying to Europeans. In the Lari8j,an ' belt that lies between the shores of the flulf and the higher ranges inland, the heat in summer is very great and is increased hythc sandy and barren plains with which this tract abounds. During the hrst two months of summer a strong north-westerly wind prevails over the whole district, which at times blows with MC37CGS 0such force that it brings with it clouds of a highly impal- pable sand. In the autumn the heat is more oppressive than in the summer, hut in winter and spring the climate is pleasant. The cold is never great and snow seldom falls. The rains, which are not heavy, fall in the winter or early spring and are almost always accompanied by a south-east wind, which, though often violent, hardly ever continues for more than three or four days at a time. The inhabitants depend largely for their water-supply on wells and on cisterns and reservoirs built with great labour to collect the scanty rainfall. The above also applies to the sea port of Lingeh, where the water from hirkeh* is almost ex clusively used, as that of the webs is brackish. General Medval Con'liHon*. Drinking water should alwavs fie boiled, or treated chemically except when drawn straight from a spring. Dust is Very bad during summer and autumn, and, with the glare and consequent prevalence of eye diseases, makes coloured spectacles desirable. Mosquitoes flourish up to 4,000 feet, wherever there is stagnant water ; malaria therefore is prevalent and mosquito nets necessary : these are also useful during the day to keep off the swarms of common flic*. Sand flies are ubiquitous and troublesome : they may he in a measure avoided by sleeping well away from any walls. Muslin bags are recom mended for sleeping in. Only muslin or nets of mesh 24 strands to the inch give protection. Repellants such as Oil of Citronella, Vermijelli, Oil of Eucalyptus, Oil of Bergamol in Kerosine, etc., have been recommended. (if tropical diseases malaria and salek are the only common ones. The latter is probably the same as the Delhi boil, and is a very indolent sore, which heals over, only to break out anew. It leaves a disfiguring scar, usually affects the face and forearms, and may be avoided by frequent washing and the use of antiseptic soap. It is probably contagious from ease to case and also from dogs, which suffer from it. Possibly also it is conveyed by some insect. An attack gives immunity. To avoid it all slight wounds should be kept covered.

Medical. Disncnsarie *.—There is a dispensary at Bushire which is housed in a very dilapidated Persian house. A new hospital is now being built and will shortly be ready. It is situated alongside the British Town Residency on the sea front. The cost of erection is being borne partly by funds raised by public subscription in the town, and partly by the British authorities. The dispensary is under the direct supervision of the Resi dency Surgeon, Persian Gulf. There is also a charitable dispensary at Lingeh which is in charge of an Assistant Surgeon. M370GS p 2General.

The amount oi supplies obtainatife in Srilitliem Persia at the commencement of operations, whether with or without the approval of the Persian Government, will be almost insig nificant owing chiefly to the unwillingness of the inhabitants to bring in what they possess for sale. During the early part of the Bushire operations of 1018 no local supplies of any kind were obtainable, but. as confidence was restored and it came to be reali ed that all supplies provided for the force would be well paid for, the hesitation on the part of the inhabitants gradually disappeared, and as the force advanced a considerable amount of fodder and other articles was obtained. Until therefore expe rience has taught that the necessity does not any longer exist, all supplies should be ca'ried, even including fodder for animals. (1) Fdrs. (a) Articles of supply obtainable. Wheat .—Wheat is harvested in July and August in the high lands and in March in the coastal area, and in between these months in the country in between according to elevation above sea level and the climate. The biggest holders of wheat in each district are the ruling Khans, a large proportion of whose revenues is obtained from dealings in produce; though they do not trade much in their own names, purchases can be made through their brokers. Rice .—After wheat, rice is the most important crop as regards human consumption, and a Persian’s material pros perity 7 is guaged by 7 the number of times a week he can afford to eat rice. There are two kinds generally 7 recognized in Shiraz, called respectively shahri and champeh. The rice is of very fair quality, but generally whiter in colour than Indian rice. At Shiraz the rice comes mainly from the fields lying to the east and south of the city near the marshes and the salt lake. It is sown towards the end of May and reaped in October. 1 h l .— r ! here are two sorts of dhal grown in Persia The commonest, known as adas, is similar to German lentils It is ioo purple-gP The othei in the B£ and is sc eaten by very nnit animals.

The commonest pulse eaten by the Persian^ is nukhud, or gram, which however is of very much finer quality than Indian gram and is never fed to animals. .■ * ■ &lt; Adas is sown in April and August and reaped in August and October. Mashak is sown in August ayd reaped in October. Nakhid is sown in April and reaped jn'August. Ghi.—Ghi, locally known as roghen, is of cxpellent quality, Gl11 * far better than that obtainable in India. It is niofily. made, from sheep and goats milk and is winter in colour than cows j,if.

Bhoosa is either from wheat or barley, the former being the whiter and better of the two. It is harvested in the Shiraz plain with the wheat and barley between July and Sep- tember. Lucerne .—This is used largejy as both a green and a dried fodder, and is obtainable green all the year except from Decem ber to February, though this depends on tin; severity of the winter. The first crop of lucerne is to be avoided as it gives horses the itch. Sugar, Tea, Ginger and Turmeric .—These are all imported, mainly from India, as also most of the chillies used. Salt .—Salt is obtained from the various salt lakes and is plentiful, cheap and good. Rock salt is also obtainable in the hills around Kamarij and in Sarvistan. Dried fruits .—Dried raisins, figs and dates, and to a lesser extent dried apricots and peaches are usually available as they form an important part of the Persian national diet. Vegetables .—Considerable quantities of fresh vegetables should normally bo obtainable, onions being as a rule the easiest to come by. Potatoes are not easy to obtain, but the follow- ' should be available during the periods shown against them :— Beans, broad and French, {lobya and bagala) Beetroot, (chogandar) Brinjal, (badinjun) ..

The tribes migrate during March and April « n d again in September to Kovember to and from their summer quarters, and their flocks and herds accompany them. The supply of livestock therefore naturally depends on the nearness of the tribes. As a general rule there should be no great difficulty, when other supplies are coming in, in obtam- hm meat in areas close to the tribal settlements. The actual supply is very large and of very good quality, and in consequence the price is comparatively little heble to fluctuation. If grazing is obtainable, it would be economical to lay in a considerable reserve. Cattle are by no means plentiful in Southern Persia as they are not used in draught at all tor transport and very little unoer pack while the Persians eat little beeh In size the cattle are small and bumpless, but they carry very good condition and should give an average outturn of at least 250 lb. Sheep are all of the fat-tailed variety and give excellent mutton. The average outturn is about 30 lb. Goats are of two kinds, a small long-haired mountain goat with an average outturn of 15 lb, and a larger, though not proportionately heavier, animal similar to the Indian goa , giving about 20 lb. (b) Grazing. Grazing is obtainable for from 2-3 months in the lower Grazing, ocuntrv to 6-7 months in the highlands in fair proximity to the roads, but could only be taken advantage of by a force going verv short stages, or by animals on a staging system having a least enough time for going 3-4 miles each way to grazing. The season and the amount available vary much according to the severity of the winter. (c) Fud. Wood .—Fuel is likely to be a difficulty for a considerable Fuel, force anywhere in Persia, and one can never count on he?pg^ ' c to gather one’s firewood, though in most p aces a air amt . light brushwood suitable as a fire-lighter is obtainable. Pur the Bushire operations in 1918 firewood was always a ddfiudty as, although it is plentiful in the hills beyond Khisht t was found by no means easy to induce the villagers to g -104 Charcoal. UillB. Storage of S applies. Firewood is classed under the two heads of “ mountain ” and “ garden,” the former being the drier, better and more expen sive of the two. Garden wood is mostly chenar, walnut, willow, ash and fruit trees. The best season for getting in a stock of wood is from June to September. From March to June, while the sap is still running, it can only be got, if at all, from Per- sians who happen to have laid in a stock, as the Persians will not cut it then. It is usually brought in on donkeys in pieces 5 feet long and requires spliting. Charcoal .—Charcoal is largely used by the Persians for cooking and in braziers, and is always obtainable in Shiraz. (d) Mills. Except at Bushire the bulk of the mills are of the water type, using horizontal stones 3 feet in diameter, and turning out 300—400 lb. per hour, or about 4,000 lb. per diem. The out turn of flour to wheat is from 97—98 per cent., no bran at all being apparently produced. There are usually mills in all vil lages with a population qf 800 or over, and the proportion of mills to inhabitants seems to work out at one per 1,000. Occa sionally in a place like Bandamir, where the water facilities are exceptional, the grinding for all the villages within a larger radius is done in one place. (e) Storage of Supplies. Storage is much assisted by the extreme dryness of the climate, already referred to, so that no particular precautions have to be taken against weevils, damp, fungi and other con comitant evils of a damp climate. Rats and mice, however, are to be found and require the ordinary precautions. The Persians do not build any special stores, but use the same kind of out-houses and godowns as are to be found in India, except that a grain store will often have a small trapdoor in the roof through which the grain is poured after it becomes impossible to get any more through the door. Straw and barley are not, as a rule, stocked in these godowns but in pits and small rooms scattered about in the villages, and one of the principal difficulties in supplying troops, is the collection of fo Ider from these various caches, as it has all to be weighed before it can bo taken over, and this wastes much time.

(h) Supplies available inland, with special reference to the Bushire- Shiraz road. In order to meet the demand for fodder and provisions which is created by the passage of large caravans of merchandise up and down the main roads, the stocks of fodder available at various stages are generally considerably in excess of the quantities actually grown by the village concerned, as fodder is brought in from the area round for sale to persons in the village who make a business of supplying caravans. It thus happens that with a few exceptions large stocks of bhoosa and barley are available at every stage from Bushire up as far as Isfahan, and more could usually be brought in at short notice. It should however be carefully noted that the whole of the countryside lying along the main caravan route to Shiraz; and thence to Isfahan is as regards surplus supplies available for sale almost entirely dependent 01 the annual rainfall. Irrigated land produces little, if anytliing, beyond bare local needs. For the last 10 years this rainfall has steadily decreased, and, whereas previous to 1910 wheat was exported in quite large quantities direct to Europe, since that time the yield has barely sufficed for the needs of the local inhabitants. So small were the crops in some years that large amounts of foodstuffs were imported from India along the Bushire-Shiraz road and as far as Isfahan. The present year (19’22i should give excellent harvests as the rainfall has b&lt; shoulc appro: for su] shoulc wintei Bv praeth town i or froi is imp partia trade ly sug but th harve: the pc distric Bushi marke shops being Tea is alway are hi relati' the e: If article local i thoug in gn Bi rock i one w crop, and p all ov winte by ha ploug If goc107 has been particularly heavy, but figures which may be given should not he relied upon with ary degree of certainty or even approximation for following seasons. All statistics therefore for supplies in South Persia, unless otherwise specifically stated, should be considered as dependent on a good rainfall the previous winter. Bvshire Town .—With the exception of fresh vegetables practically all the food supply for the 16,000 inhabitants of the town comes in by sea, either from the Angali districts via Shif, or from Haiat Daf:d, via Pandar Rig and Ganaveh. Firewood is imported from Tangistan, chiefly by boat from Daiyir, and partially by donkeys across the fnashileh. A considerable trade exists with Karachi for in'ported artielbs of food, especial ly sugar. There are three mills for grinding flour in the town, but the supply is only just aboi,bequal to the demand. In good harvest years there is a fair expert of wheat and barley from the port, the whole of this being collected from the surrounding districts, chiefly Ha:at Daiid and Shabankareh, by buyers from Bushire. The bazar is well stocked. There is a large vegetable market and a meat market; and the ordinary grain and grocers shops are spread throughout the bazar, the .bulk of the grain being at the southern end of the bazar and near the wharves. Tea is largely drunk by the inhabitants, and a large stock is always held. Sugar is exported to the hinterland. Prices are high and subject to the most violent fluctuations, their relative cheapness when compared with India^ depending on the exchange value of the krdn. If necessary, by resorting to substitutes for ordinary ration articles, there is no reason why 6,000 men should not live on local resources for a month without unduly straining the bazar, though there is no question that any such action would result in greatly inflating, prices. Bushire. Island .—This is a sandy waste with patches of rock outcropping at frequent intervals, and in the summer no one would think it was capable of producing even an indifferent crop. Fruit gardens and date palms are found near houses, and pits, dug down through the top layer of rock, are found all over the island containing vines and fig trees. When^the winter rains fall, barley and wheat are scattered on the ground by hand, donkeys, ponies and bullocks are yoked to primitive ploughs, the seed is ploughed in and left to the hand of God If good rains are received, there is a good crop, and if the rains Bushire Town.

Most of the wells are all brackish and only hold sufficient water to irrigate small plots contaimnij; a few vegetables. These are chiefly broad beans, lettuce, carrots, beetroot, tomatoes and spinach during the winter, ahd melons, ladies lingers, onions, biinjals and cucumbers during the hot mor.ihs. ■ ' Chagfiddak —Tinier this title is included the group of villages near this place. Trom (i rak come most of the vegetables for Busliire city. Dates are largely exported from the Ahram valley, All Changl, On rak and surrounding villages into Bt'shire. Around Chahlcf tah an excellent crop of wild oat hay (loealh known as zartgold) is grown as a fodder crop. This is a magnh licent fodder, but expensive. The water supply k brackish and deficient in quantity. No supplies would be available for a force in this area. Ah Dt'nn.—’PractieaUy the same. remarks apply to AJimadi. as to Thaghadak. The water is, if anything, worse, and animals have to mar h 4 miles to Chahkutah for water as the local sup ply is insufficient. Khuahah and surrounding villages.—rA small quantity of bhoosa can be obtained from the surrounding villages. Bo)dz.jun .—A regiment could be supplied without difficulty always, and in ordinary years a large force could live on the country, as the surrounding villages grow considerable quan tities of barley and wheat. There are many date palms and a good brand of tobacco ,is produced. Firewood is brought down from, the slopes of Glsakan hill. Ddlikl.—A small yillaga at the foot of the Fili Fill with lareo groves of date palms. Wood is brought in from the surrounding hills.

Rice of good quality, wheat of very good quality, Kabuli gram and maize are also grown in the area, but not to any large extent. Firewood sufficient for a division could be obtained. The sheep and goats of the Kashkiilis are pastured round about. The early spring is not a good time for purchasing livestock, as this is the time when the tribes are making their ghi and the wool clip has not yet been taken. A'drar-'n.—Lying as it does in the centre of a well-watered Kazarun. and nourishing plain, this town could probably support two regiments. There are extensive fruit garden^ to the south of the town, containing orangds, pomegranates, grapes, mulberries and figs. A small quantity of oats are grown near the town. Barley ia the chief crop, and there are large quantities of barley and bhoosa obtainable, both of excellent quality. Sufficient wheat is grown for local consumption. In an average year sufficient grain and fodder should bo available for a division of all arms for at least ten days. Firewood is brought in from the surrounding hills where there are large quantities available, but large stocks are not kept in the town. Fresh vegetables, can be obtained all the year round, say for 100 men. There is a fair quantity of locally grown rice. Rock salt of excellent quality, Quarried in the hills near Kamarij, is sold in the bazar. Water, which is plentiful from running streams from the hills, is of excellent quality. Jdhnim,. —-This town is well supplied with straw and barley Jahrum. from unirrigated lands ; both are cheap in norma! years. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary veal's here. The average annual output of grain is estimated at l,27fi tons. Fam .—At times it is very difficult to obtain fodder at all, Fasii - especially after the passage of the Khaaiseh. There is the extensive irrigated cultivation. Fasa is the centre of the Knamseh tribes’ country, and ha' some importance from a mili tary point of view in consequence. Two regiments could live110 Abiidch. Flriizftbid. on the country in ordinary years. The average annual output of grain was estimated in 1911 at 2,950 tons, while that of the neighbouring district of Sarvistan was 2,970 tons. Abddch .—The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here, but for the winter supplies would have to be laid in before December. Flruzdbdd .—The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here; no difficulty in winter. In fact, one regiment of cavalry or infantry could live on the country almost anywhere, as supplies would be always obtainable from villages in the neighbourhood. In 1911 the average annual output of grain was estimated at 820 tons and of rice at 1,630 tons, while the output of grain in the adjoining district of Slmakan was estimated at 1,430 tons. Iqlid, Mahin, Bavanat, Ardakan, Baiza, Marvadasht, Arsin- jan, Sarvistan, Istehbanat, Darab, ’Alamarvadasht, Khurmuj, and anj'where in DashtI, Dashtistan, and the other coastal districts as far as Behbehan would be favourable centres for obtaining local supplies. If the local population is actively hostile, and opposition is encountered from villages at which it is desired to purchase supplies, only mountain-guns could effectively break down their resistance and force them to give up their supplies, which are generally scattered in small store-houses all over the village; it is improbable however that villagers would offer more than passive resistance to an invading army. As regards the provisioning of troops at Shiraz without the consent of the Persian authorities, the possibility of a general boycott must always be reckoned with, even if the 1 ersian Government do not actively object to the presence of the force at Shiraz : it is therefore undesirable to send a force to Shiraz, which is not in a position, if necessary, to compel the sale of food-stuffs which it requires. But it must be realised that the force, whether in Shiraz with the consent of the Persian authorities or not, must be dependent mainly on supplies of fodder, etc., brought in from outlying districts, either directly by its own transport, or through native agency; if distmbanees prevail outside the town, or if the tribes are taking active measures to make a boycott effective, villagers will be prevented from bringing in supplies, and prices will rise rapidly obliging t merits to I outside. For th following (D « (2) K (3) S (4) K Firewi Dasht-i-A It seer ina villag available for the m for Shiraz available though of were neec Assuming to be abo size is al oould live larger nu necessary There flour, as 1 wheat fro ties; the titles as i should be It is very wheat am way of ot largely us Artich in compa entire croIll 62. &gt;nfpnt of the much here, before much here; ry or pplies hood, ed at n the 1 .

For this purpose the best districts would generally be the following:— (1) Kavar, very fertile. (2) Khafr, south of Kavar, very fertile. (3) Sarvistan : fertile 30 miles south-east of Shiraz. (4) Kurbal, Marvdasht, Baiza and Ardakan ; all very fertile. Firewood is plentiful near Kavar, and at Khan-i-Zin an and Dasht-i-Arjan. It seems that the average crop of wheat and barley per house in a village is about 1.200 mans ShirazI, or 9,000 lb. ; if half be available for sale to the outside public, the produce destined for the market would be about 2 tons per house, or 40,000 tons for Shiraz and 50 miles round. Of this quantity half should bo available for the use of an occupying force in a normal year, though of course prices would go up rapidly if so large a quantity were needed. In a bad year, 10,000 tons should be available. Assuming the requirements of a cavalry brigade with transport to be about 20 tons a day of wheat and barley, a force of this size is about the maximum, which, it can be safely assumed, could live on the country as far as grain is concerned ; a rather larger number of. infantry could be supplied, but it might be necessary occasionally to feed them on barley flour. There should be no difficulty in providing 10,000 men with flour, as long as native agency is not relied on to bring in the wheat from the districts. Flour is never stored in large quanti- ties; the wheat is sent to the mill to be ground in small quan tities as required. Mills are numerous round Shiraz, and there should be no difficulty in hiring one or more for the use of a force. It is very uneconomical to purchase flour; it is better to buy wheat and have it ground under supervision ; this is the only way of obtaining good flour with certainty ; bran and barley are largely used as adulterants.

The entire crops of a whole season are only sufficient to supply the112 Laristan. Transport, erai. want? of fjho capital for a period of three months, whilst ah average crop is only equal to a two months supply. Only the well-to-do people use pure white bread which is made from Hour imported from Fans, Isfahan and Khurasan. Water is obtain ed mostly from kanats and is sufficient to water about 20,000 acres*. Water is reached at a depth of 180 to 200 feet. Timber is imported from neighbouring hills and firewood is obtainable, though not in anv large quantities (3) LaristIn. T.aristan is one of the poorest and least productive provinces of Persia,’ranking in this respect only second to the Bash aka id country. This is due in part to the lawlessness of tlie in habitants. but still more so to the country itself. Much of it is an arid desert diversified by rocky hills and valleys ot sand and salt. The inhabitants depend to a large extent for their water-supply on cisterns and reservoirs built with great labour, to collect the scanty rainfall, and upon wells. By far the most important product is the date, which flour ishes everywhere. Some wheat and barley is also cultivated especially in the Tar and Bastak divisions, which also support Immense (locks ol sheep and goats besides smaller numbers of cattle, donkevs and camels. The swamps opposite Qishm Is land can provide large quantities of fuel, a scarce commodity in this province, and a considerable quantity is also obtainable From the Kuh-i-Gavbus range near Bastak. * , (II) TRANSPORT. Gen- Wuth the exception of an almost negligible quantity in Basin're and to a lesser degree Shi; ay there is no wheeled transport in Southern Persia. Where water and forage are available, the mule is the best and fastest animal, but there are some places where the scarcity of these makes the use of camel transport imperative. IXmkey caravans are also much ased. lor employment with his own animals the Persian caravan man, or tbdh'r(i'18,r, is excellent, but when he is merely in charge 6f animals not his own property much supervision is necessary. His endurance and stamina are marvellous and his wants as regards food and clothing very small. He is usually accustom ed to handling arms, and a Martini-Henry carbine is the most useiul weapon, if it is desirable to arm him. He treats his ani mals with great care and kindness. The length of marches is dependent on the water-supply : the first march is always made short, nnl ,5 nht an For eq will -a fo black goa only obtai too heavy Persian to {or camel ‘ Carava For wa rater fro'n bars and £ existing v water tan!

For equipment an ample supply of ropes should be brought yitli -a force. The supply could probably be kept up with |, jack c/oat-hair ropes in the country. S. T. €. gunny packs are on lv obtainable in small numbers ; the Persian sack is much too heavy. Jhools could be made up in large quantities in any , Persian town. Yaikdans of the Indian pattern are most suitable for camel and mule transport. Caravan men dislike any article weighing over 100 lb. For waterii\g purposes provision must be made for drawing water from 'wells, sometimes very deep. Picks, shovels, crow* liars and galvanised iron buckets are necessary for clearing out existing wells: For use in Persia the S. 1 T. C. galvanised iron water tank is'most satisfactory. Persian pack mulcS are a very fine form .of transport, the Mules, animals being as good material as the mea who drive them. The mules stand front 13-2 to 14-2 and look even bigger owing to the jjffeftliai’-high, two pointed saddle. They are always* in very good condition, although they work under far ..harder con ditions'than would be considered possible in India- the recog nized load being 40 mum 1 ? or 290 lb. , The normaldaily ration is about T-lb. of barley miked up with 15 lb. of bhyosa. The Persian donkey is an exceptionally bardy-animal and very Donkeys, much superior to the Indian donkey both in ■size; and strength. The Persian thinks nothing of giving a donkey a load of 215 ib. Though slower than the mule they are nevertheless capable »t doing equally long marches. Donkeys receive the same ieed as horses, barley 7 lb. daily, or on the road with loads 10 li). and one Shah man of bhoosa daily. The number of camels in and around Pars is not so great Camels&gt; as formerly, and their quality is not very high. Mpst of them arc.weak and weedy, with poor carrying power, their maximum average load being only 320 lb. In Bushire and Shiraz there are a few carts, (half a dozen, carts, but not more) chiefly of the four-wheeled fourgom type. There' are, however, few opportunities ordinarily for the use of wheeled vehicles owing to thb badness- of the roads. During the Busilire operations in 1018, when a certain amount of im provement had-, been made to the roads to the north of Bu shire, a special light-draught single mule cart, made specially mcthcgs' ' &lt;a114 Oxen. t\ Fara.

The total number of transport animals in Fars has Up estimated at about 5,b00 mules, 16,500 donkeys, 2,000 ean,pl 0 and l,7o0 horses. Tins may be regarded rather as an under estimate than the reverse. It would, however, he very diffien t to obtain transport in any considerable quantity without rZ mug the risk of interfering seriously with the requirements of the inhabitants and thereby incurring their hostility. At the commencement of a campaign it may be taken pi fairly certain that the local population would be too frightened to bi'^g in their animals. As, however, their confidence was restored it is thought that at least 300 camels 400 mule, l a ,000 donkeys should be obtainable in the .S^ty^'BnX, from among the animals working on the Bnshirc'.Shhferoid In the winter considerable numbers of camels emm, ri graze around Chlhkntth, and it is possible that an even 3* umbei than .100 could be obtained from that area- On th other hand durmg the grazing season (15th March to 15tl, Mat the mules are turned out to graze and at that time difficult would probably be experienced in obtaining as many as 40 The following table gives an approximate estimafp ^ * 1 , local needs an d could not be drawn on to any extent District.

There are no camels around Shiraz either to the west or the east. In Bavanat district, however, the tribes men own large herds. Kazarun, Shiraz and Sivand are the principal centres for obtaining mules, and it is said that around the first named there are some 2,000 and around the last about 1,000. The tribesmen own considerable numbers of horses and breed extensively. The Qashqai, which is to be found in large numbers in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, is the best. Most of these are of a cobby type with short heavy necks and slack loins. Their average height is about 14 I hands. They are, however, reputed to have neither heart nor manner. In the Darab valley the Baharlu own a great many brood mares of good quality, averaging bigger and heavier than those found round Shiraz. It should ordinarily be possible to buy 100 useful horses in the valley in a month. A large number of donkeys are to be found everywhere. As in the case of the coastal area, however, the amount of trans port possessed by the inhabitants only suffices for their own needs. (2) Yazd. The camel is the chief transport animal in the province, Yazd. though nrnles and donkeys are also used. In the town and Trtnsparfc. districts there are some 5,000 camels owned by the local inha-116 LarisMn. Transport. bitants, and tbeaa are almost entirely employed in the caravan traffic towards the south. It is said that a certain amount of camel-breeding is done in the Shahr-i-Babak district. No mules are bred in the district and very tew are owned. Thest that are seen in Yazd come in from outside in caravans. Don keys are numerous and are useti considerably for triuisport pur poses, but rarely over long distances. No good horses are, bred in the province, nor are many kept. (3) Ldrislun. F Camels and donkeys are the chief means of transport, but no figures are available a-; to the numbers belonging to the inhabitants. It can be safely assumed, however, that for any operations in Laristan all transport would have to be provided -from outhide. , - '. , , Yelerviary 'Nofe. In It) 17 during the march from Bandar Abbas to Sh'raz the outstanding feature from a veterinary point of view was the number of cases of foot lameness in the transport mules, and the extensive galls from the pack saddlery and gzfang in the mules and camels. The mules were not shod, and, as the going was very hard and stony and the marches, long and arduous, they suffered exceedingly from bruised feef and lamiriitis, and a good many had to be left behind at the varirtufe stages. The Assistant Director of Veterinary Sendee with the Column reported that, had the mules been shod with the special Wide-webbed shoe which is used for indigenous transport animals’, the percentage •of foot trouble would have been much less. He advised that all mules sent to Southfen Persia should he shod before being sent up country, preferably with the local pattern shoe, though the Indian pattern shoe would be better than nothing. The advantages ai ti (.isadva cages of the Persian method oi elioeing are described on page 118. The Persian pack saddle has many advantages over the Indian pattern for use in Southern Persia. For though it appears somewhat huge and cumbrous, it distributes the weight over a much larger surface than does the Indian pattern. These saddles do excellently in the hands of the Persian chdrvdcldr. The following contagious diseases are found in the area under review :— (danders, mange (sarcoptic) and fever (probably piro- plasmods) Tl Persia atfech the ho numei An ac glands met w teral i ulceptl deuce, met wi diffuse case of As be moi for the sub sent several cording tematic Man taken c sarcopt situatic neck.

As regard y, the horse, the common type seems to be of an acute farcy nature, numerous buds usually apregring in various parts of the body. Air iicute catarrhal.type with swelling of loth submaxhlary glands, and ulceration of both sides of the sejlum nasi has boon met with. The chronic type o ten seen in the west,i.e., unila teral enlarged sabmaxilbary gland with nasal discharge and ulceration of the scp!\nv tut si on the affected side is not in ov - denee. In n i.les the disease appears to be of the type usually niet with in mules, rh'., an acute bilateral catarrh with extensive diffuse xdq^r^tion of ii:o sepiuni, nasi. No record exists of any case of:chyouie glandeis in the mule in this part of Persia. As regards the mullein test, the reaction to this appears to. be more delayed then in ether countries. It is tp ite common for there to be practically no swelling at the 24th hour, and sutse.-iuently an enormems'topical re/ t ion, w Inch proceeds tor several days, to develop. There is almost invariably marked cording. In typical reactions there is generally marked sys tematic disturbance with disinclination to feed. Mange is also a prevalent disease, and little or no notice is taken of it by the inhabitants. The prevailing type-is of ;he sarcoptic variety, and it runs a normal course, the n'ost com mu, t situations being under the saddlc-r .-nd along the back and neck. Ringworm, strangles and eatarrah arc also noticed. One of the chief causes of infection is the use of sarais for- stabling. The sarai' throughout the country are in a filthy condition, ideal for the growth of germs. Unless they can be taken over by the army and disinfected, and then kej t solely for military use, they should not be used at all. Two parasites are chiefly met with, (a) tots (stomach&gt;, which are very common, and (b) ascaridcs, which are met with occa sionally. r Ihc dry climate, however, does not favour the hutch ing out of ova. Horses and mules are shod in Persia in a manner, which, 0 j the natives say, gives them the best foothold and protection moving over rough stony passes.118 The hoof is shortened to the required length with a clumsy cutter and rasp, and a thin plate, which covers the entire lower surface of the foot, except for a circular hole over the frog, is then fitted by cold hammering, and secured on each side by four large headed nails about long, which are roughly clenched. The plates are not countersunk and the heads of the nails all project and give a foothold even on sheet rock. This pattern of shoe has been tested by Indian Cavalry and transport units and condemned, because mud works into the hollow parts of the sole, through the hole in the centre of the shoe, and the sole, being enclosed, cannot be properly cleaned and thrush is induced. On the other hand, it is pointed out that horses, shod in the ordinary way, are almost inevitably * lamed by the rocks and stones on Such roads as that between Bushire and Shira: ; aho the Persian pattern is exclusively and successfully used by all Persian muleteers, men who spend their lives on the road, and do practically all the carrying trade of the country. British officers travelling in Persia all speak favourably of the shoe, especially for mules, though for horses opinions differ. Taking everything into consideration, it would appear that animals, required to work over dry, rooky, stony ground would best be shod with the Persian pattern, while those working over wet, muddy, soft ground, or piquetted in permanent standings, which are liable to get damp and foul, should be .shod with the ordinary shoe.120 CHAPIER VI. Military. 1 Persian army. At the present time it maybe said that no regular Persian Army is in existence. The Governor-Generals and Governors of the various provinces keep up just so many irregular troops as they are obliged to by the exigencies of the local situation, but the numbers vary to such an extent that it is impossible to secure any satisfactory figures concerning these forces. The following are the numbers of armed men available in the various districts and tribes :— CoastaTzone. Coastal dis'ricts north of B shire. —The armed forces at the disposal of the Khan of Haiat Da d are estimated ; t 1,500 to ‘2,000 tufangchis in normal times. In 1909 Haider Khan des patched some 400 armed men to B.'ishire to assist the Darva Begi in his expedition to Tangistan. The Khan can also dis pose of the armed forces of R d Hi'leh, numbering some 700 tufangchis, as well as contingents from Gan'veil and Lrav 7 , numbers unknown. The Shab&amp;nkareh and Zira. districts are said to be able to muster 1,500 tufangchis. Tan an. Tangistjn .—The number of men in Tangistan armed with modem rifles may be estimated at about 1,000. There are how ever so many blood feuds and enmities that it would be as a rule unlikely to find more than 300 acting together. In the attack on B7shire in 1915 and the operations against the Tangis- tan's in the same year their forces numbered 590 fiOO.oneach occasion. Among these however were included a number of sup porters from Dashtistan. i)a h istdn. r l ne number of riflemen available in Da htistan is hard to estimate but cannot exceed 2,000. Ahmad and Chahxutai can produce 150—200 rifles. Borfzj; nand surround ing villages 600 /00 rifles and Daliki 50 rifles, giving a total of 80 that 1,000 is probably nearer to the correct estimate of the number of armed men. In the event of punitive raids into Tangistan it would be uni ey that the inhabitants would receive much assistance ;[ om neighbours in Dashtistan, though possibly a few of the villages nearest the border might join in.

Once. :thQh; v llages are seized and .th^dr country over un the.t resistance collapses almost immediately. There is a great scarcity of ammunition in these districts.

I s eueld not maintain in .he ibid at anv one time more than about 3,(300- 4,000men. h. 1911 when the i.axnseh-.122 Khamseh were united against Nizam-es-Saltaneh and Saulat-ud- Do deh in the fighting in Shiraz city the Arab forces numbered some 3,000 men. That the Arabs can and will fight was proved in 1918 when a squadron of Burma Mounted Infantry attacked a group of Arab encampments and a stubborn fight of four hours’ duration ensued In the 1911 fighting in Sh raz against the QashqSb the Arabs showed great spirit and determination and inflicted a severe defeat on theii' enemies. It has yet to be seen wha f these tribes would do against a tillery. It is improbable that they would stand against a well-directed fire. The Khamseh tribes are well armed though they possess a greater variety of rifles than the Qashqas. Most patterns of rifle may be found among these tribes, but they are chiefly armed with Mausers, Lebels and Martinis. It is difficult to arrive at any estimate of the quantity of ammunition in the possession of the tribes. In April 1918, ammunition was reported to be scarce among the Arabs, and it would appear that 100 rounds per rifle is a safe maximum estimate. The Kal'nt'rs of each tribe have a small reserve, probably not more than a few hundred rounds. In March 1916 the Qawam-ul-Mulk was presented by the British Government with 2,000 non-charger loading Lee Enfield rifles and 3,33^000 rounds of ammunition, but no distribution of these arms has been received and it is not known among what tribes they were divided. The Qawam also has two German machine guns, but both are out of order and he has very little ammunition for them. His artillery consists of one 9 c.m. Turkish mountain gun for which he has practically no she 1. (a) Arabs. —The fighting men of the Arabs are approxi mately as follows :— Jabbareh .. .. .. 4,900 Shaibani .. .. .. 3,250 Total .. 8,150 For further details regarding the numbers of fighting men in the sub-t.ibes, see Appendix A. (b) 'Ainal'r. —The fighting men of the ’Ainalu may be taken at 700 tufangchis and 100 sowars armed with A variety of rifle*123 They probably have less ammunition than the other Khamseh tribes as they are not addicted to robbery and therefore do not purchase ammunition to the same extent. (c) Bahdrlv ,—The Baharlus are said to be able to raise 1,000 sowars and 500 tvfangchis under favourable conditions. The tribe is rich in horses and appears to have a rooted objection to undertaking any journey or military operations on foot. They are reported to have fairly large reserves of ammuni tion. (d) Baser !.—For number of fighting men see Appendix B. (c) Nafar .—It is doubtful if the Nafar can now raise more than 100—150 lufangchls. Qdshqdls .—For every family at least one fighting man may Qsshqais. be reckoned. This gives a theoretical total of 30,000 fighting men, but this represents the maximum number of rifles avail able in the tribe. No IlkhanI, however, has ever been able to maintain a force of more than 4,000—5,000 men in the field at any onetime. In 1911 when the Qashqa s were united against the Khamseh tribes and again during the fighting around Shiraz in May and June 1918 the Ilkhanl had not more than 4,000—6,000 Qashqais under his command in spite of favourable circum stances. In the latter instance the whole II was mobilised for migration to the Sarhad. The QashqaTs are well-armed. It is reckoned that there are in the tribe at least 20,000'—'25,000 modern small-bore magazine rifles (chiefly Mausers). During the operations against the Qashqa 7 s in May and June 1918 no black powder was observed and all wounds were smell-bore gunshot wounds During these same operations the enemy was plentifully supplied with ammu nition. Their expenditure was considerable and must have greatly depleted their stocks. After recent experience, however, it would be a mistake to reckon on a shortage of ammunition. The Qashqai has a reputation for bravery which he did not belie during the operations of 1918. The DarashurTs, Kashkul s, Farslmtdans, Shishbulukls and Ghallehzan UghrTs are regard ed as th? warrior clans. Mobility is the Qashqals’ strong point. At the first sign of a fetirement, hills which were apparently empty of tribesmen will swarm with sowars and footmen, all moving at their utmost pace The Qashqai rides light and will force his horse to an all-out gallop over the roughest ground. 1 heir ponies are small and wirv and will climb hills which wouldappoar nig^ ijppossjtlbtic. In the lighting round STi raz it was found advantageous to keep fire fights.at 70 .f—-800 yards. In this way Lewis and machine guns inflicted considerable casral- ties on the enemy with comparatively small loss, as the Qash- qa is a poor marksman at ranges over 500 yards. (Jn several occasions the Darash r horsemen charged in mounted, firing from the saddle. On arriving within 40---50yards of their enemy they wheel and gallop back to their starting place. Envelop ing tactics are much practised by them, and they will, whore- ever possible, attempt to outflank an enemy. The Q&amp;shqai does not, yhg himeslf in, hut utili o;. any natural cover he can find (oh the crest of a hill for preference) or constructs sangars.

Mamassani .—The fighting strength of the Mamassanis is estimated at 230 sowars and 2,000 tufangchis. These are said to be good rifle shots and to have a reputation for bravery and stamina. The tribe is said to be well-armed, but ammunition is short. Lashdni. —The Lashanis can possibly turn out 1,500 fight ing men, but the tribe is not well armed or well supplied with ammunition. During the fighting in September 1917 it was computed that about 50 per cent, of their arms were small bore and the remainder Martinis, etc. Mishmad .—This tribe is reported to be well armed with Mauser and other small bore rifles, and to possess very few Martinis. A great number of rifles belonging to the Gend armerie are said to have passed into their possession during the Great War. They are reported to have 200 rifles and are gen erally well supplied with ammunition. Boir Ahmadu—Oi the 3,300 fighting men belonging to this tribe Shakrullah Khan in 1918 controlled 1,000, Karim Khan 1,400, Qaid Muhammad Ali 150, and Mulla Qobad 150. The Boir Ahmadi has a reputation for pluck and stamina and he is much feared by those who come into contact with him, even more so than the Arabs or Qashqais. The footmen of the7 / 127 and are said ^ It is worthy of note that— (i) there is continual enmity between the Karim Khan section and the Shukruliah Kh5,n section. (H) Qaid Muhanimad Ali and his followers are very friend- ly with the Sisakhtis under Mulla Qobad and often carry out raids in conjunction with them. ?? ,r Ahmadis have comparatively few mounted men and should consequently be easier to deal with as far as the pS&gt; tection of the road is concerned, especially as they invariab'lv attack caravans at certain well-known points. Their favourite localities for robbing operations are .— ravounte ( *). In the Yazd district a ud along the Yazd-Isfahan road. (») Between Aminabad and Isfahan, especially near . aksud Beg Asiab thah (midway between Qumi- sheh and MehTar), Mehiar and the Urchin pass (m) Gai^-i-Cir (midway between Aminabad and Yazd- i-Khast) which they reach via Hanna and a pass through the hills about 8 miles west of Yazd-i-Khast. {iv) Be tween Bijdaneh and Tarseh, which they reach via Heghirdu (where they usually halt for the night) and through the hills 5 miles west of the road, either by the lang-i-Allah-ed-Douleh or theTang-i-Tarseh. (v) Between Tul-i-Siah and Bid Alam, which they reach vta Deghirdu and the Tang-i-Bld Alam. (v*) QuB Kush pass and Kuh-i-Jangi (3 miles south of Khan-i-Khurreh). Of recent years they have not been robbing in this locality. (m) dang-j-Mian Mulla (between Mashhad-i-Murghab and Khan-i-Kargun). They very rarely rob in this locality. The Boir Ahmadis do not carry out their raids after the yaauqais have taken up their summer quarters and their rod- Ding operations are consequently confined to certain periods of the year, viz .:— ^ In the spring .—After the snow on the passes (particularly on the Gardan-i-Bezan) has melted and until the Gashqals come up, i.e., between the end of March and the middle of May,Pushmanziari. • 12:8 ' . In tie antvmv.-A'tev the QashqATs go down and until the passes become blocked by snow, i.e., from tlie end of September until the end of November, or middle of December (if the weather is favourable). Their robber bands are much larger than those of the Arabs or of the Qashqas, being seldom less than 100 strong and some- times as many as 300-400. Only about 10 per cent, of these arc mounted. A curious procedure which the Bolr Ahmadis are said to adopt occasionally is to send a dozen footmen, armed only with ■Sticks, along the road. Those start a quarrel with the r/wr- radars of tie particular caravan they wish to rob (ge. eralh at some fixed point and, in the middle of the resulting fight and confusion, tie main body of the robbers suddenly appears on the scene and drives olL the laden animals. r)Kshmavzian.-T\ns' tribe can probably turn out some 1 500 lighting men. They are described as a warlike tribe and well-ar &amp; ed.- Nothing definite is known as to their arms and ammunition.

South Ptrisa Riflet.—The only Persian force of any fighting value in Southern Persia of recent years has been the South Persia Rifles. Raised by Sir Percy Sykes in 1916 and com manded and trained' by British and Indian officers and instruc- tors they formed an efficient safeguard for the tranquillity of the districts where they were stationed, and their presence acted as an effective deterrent to the local bad*m#h*r who, pre vious to their formation, had rendered the majority of the trade routes impassable. In the area under review was stationed the Headquarters of the South Persia Rifles and also the bars Bn- vade These were located at Sh raz, and the Pars Brigade had detachments at Kazarun and Borazjun. This Brigade consisted until the middle of 1921 of one battery of artillery, one regiment oi Cavalry, two infantry regiments, one machine gun squadron ajid one field company of engineers and was entirely self-contain- ed, possessing its own veterinary, medical, signalling and trans- port personnel. Its strength amounted to 3,400 officers and men with 4 guns and 6 machine guns. It has now been dis- banded. The Persian Government will probably maintain a small force to take its place, but this-cannot either in numbers or efficiency provide an adequate substitute for the South l ersia Rifles in the task of maintaining law and order. The following is a list .of the landing places for aeroplanes :— Bushire, 2 miles south of the town is a completely equipped landing ground fit for all type of machines. All the R. A. F. personnel have now been withdrawn and the station has been closed. The hanger of 8 -- bays, suitable only for small and medium sized machines, has been left on the ground. A small store of petrol and oil has also been retained. Care takers for the hangar are being provided by the local Persian authorities under arrangements made by the Political Resident, Bushire. The aerodrome is 600 yards s uare, and its surface isle\el and good. It is however very exposed, and in the dry weather sandstorms are liable to prove a serious source of trouble.

Note on iMre and Lingeh.—The following points should be borne in mind in the event of operations in face of an enemy at Bushire and Lingeh : Bushire town lies at the northern end of a peninsula 14 miles long and about 4-5 miles broad and is connected with the main- land bv a broad track leading across the mashUeh on the east side It is easily defensible from the land side, as the track from the interior across the mashUek is commanded by a ridge rising W feTabove the road level. From 191(^18 the town and island were defended by a chain of 10 pests connected by wire entanglements, starting from a point near the sea shore S,\V of the Residency at Sabzabad and extending across the neck of the island to the edge of a deep indentation of the sea into the mashUeh. This plan of defence was found to answer well (Vide Map of Bushire Island). There are no modern fortifications, but at Reshire there is a deserted mlan. The town fo-merlv had on the land side a wall 30 feet high and 5-6 feet thick, pierced for musketry. The town has however long since overflowed its old boundary and the wall has been de^ stroved in so manv places and built around that for purposes of defence it may be said not to exist. There are no sea defen ces. Q une There are at present 2 modern breech-loading guns in existence at Bushire. One is a 77 rn.m. field gun and the other a much smaller 70 m.m. calibre. Both of these are mounted on carriages and are in fair condition. They are of Austrian manu facture. Ammunition available is very scanty, certainly not more than 30—40 rounds. The 2 guns are at present in the porch of the Finance Department, overlooking the Khur- Sultam, but there is no one in Bushire who is capable of serving them. Situated in the yard of the old barracks in the south of the town are 2 modern breech-loading guns of 85 m.m. and 2 howitzer of 22 c.m. bore. These weapons are altogether useless, haung been left exposed to all weathers in the courtyard for many years past and being in consequence pitted with rust and with man' parts missing including all the sighting apparatus. 1 here art ( lievad to be some few' rounds of ammunition for the two 8o m.m gumi i n some of the sheds of the barracks, but that for thfe howi zers was never in Bushire, having been sent by mistake to mze There are 3 small muzzle-loaders on carriages outside the south of the town and a number of dere ict muzzle-loading g u,li lying ah and cais The many M per rifle a fight i mashileh ground bases of and stir Abo Gurak &lt; on Bus lowlyini about 3 a positi an enei require Lin&lt; any poi tooppe of a g: water' s siderab of hou s’.tuath resistei most i open a stony a prec plain 5 30—4( the no gradu; Ling 1 whole of the the n&lt; moun mainshould enemy 4 miles ? main- he. east :k from e rising m and )y wire ie neck :he sea answer modern , The nd5—6 r er long een de poses of i defen- ; guns in he other mted on n manu- inly not t in the • Sultani, them. di of the howitzer i, having my years th many re are he- 85 m.m. he howit- ;o Enzeli. tside the ling g«n» 1 vmg about in various places. The former which have carriages and caisssons are used for saluting purposes. The inhabitants of the town and peninsula possess a good many Martinis and modern magazine rifles with 50—80 rounds per rifle. They number at the outside 1,000 and are not a lighting class. Their military value is negligible. The mashTleh, especially when dry, for 15 miles is most excellent ground for cavalry, which can also work well up to the bases of the hills. The maskUeh, however, becomes very deep and sticky after rain. About 15 miles from Biishire a long ridge passing through Gurak offers a position facing south-west to a force advancing on Bushire from the east or south-east, ft commands all the lowlymg ground towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of about 300 feet above the level of the plain. It would also afford a position facing north-east to ti force covering Bushire against an enemy advancing from the east, though its extent would require a considerable body of troops to hold it. Lingeh has no sea defences and no garrison, nor is there u«8eh. any position which could be held with any prospect of success to oppose a landing on eit her side of the town covered by the hre of a gunboat. The houses however come right down to the waters edge along the saa front and it would be a matter of con- side-able difficulty to shell riflemen posted in the upper stories of houses overlooking the landing places in the town. 1 his s'tuation would of course only arise in the event of a stubborn resistance being offered by the townspeople, an occurrence most unlikely to take place. The town is situated m the open and the country round rises gradually, but with a bare stonv incline for some 3 miles. At the summit of the rise a precipitous escarpment is reached, which drops to a salt plain 50 feet below and about a mile broad. This again drops 30—40 feet to another plain, which stretches for some miles to the north-west of the town. On the north-east the mountains gradually close in and reach the coast line some o miles east of Liug h. A few guns placed on the ridge would command the whole country to the north and west. Owing to the formation of the country there are only three approaches to Lmgeh from the north and west. A fourth road leads along the back of the mountains and eventually comes in from tie ea«t, joining main road from that quarier. Any force marching cither by134: Q&amp;shq&amp;Is. this or by the sea-coast road would be exposed to shellfire from ships in the harbour. There are only 2 small mozKle-kiading guns on earn'ages in Lingeh. These are situated on the sea front in front of the old Fort. They are used for saluting purposes. During the threatened raid on Lingeh in 1910 the fighting force of the town proved to be 70 tufangchls, and 200 men under the Shaikh of the Arab quarter. These numbers probably still hold good with approximate accuracy. About half the above force would have magazine rifles, the remainder small' bore. Martini and old fashioned large bore single-loading rifles. Am munition for all classes of firearms is not plentiful. Ten masonry towers were built. Those as a whole were placed in good posi tions and six of them were taken over as pioquet posts by the British naval force which landed. These six alone remain and are in good condition. The local tribes until recently possessed few rifles and very little ammunition, hut during the height of the gun-running operations modem arms and ammunition were introduced into the district. The natives are not warlike nor fit to be trained as soldiers. Note on the Qashqais .—In any military operations against the Qashqais the main factor to be considered is that they are as a whole a migratory tribe, that their wealth mainly depends on their flocks and herds, and that any stoppage or interruption of their annual migration would result in their losing much of their livestock owing to want of means of feeding them. When on the move they travel very slowly, grazing as they go and often staying a few days in a place where the grass is better than else where. Cattle, sheep and goats move over the hillsides; men. women and children with the baggage animals carrying their belongings keep along the tracks. It will be understood how extremely vulnerable they are during these migrations. They are obliged to keep to their regular routes within certain narrow limits, as otherwise they encroach on the rights of other sections or tribes and consequently provoke their hostility 7 . In addition to the fact that all their moveable property is practically at the mercy of organized raiding parties, troops in occupation of Shiraz and the Kazarun valley in October and November could, by blocking their routes, keep them up in the high ground where their cattle and sheep would all perish from lack of grazing during the winter. Similarly troops at these places in the spring conic a lik engaj to tb resist A Gulf. Persi rifles been from were t ri bes v ice their T By f the I miles to M?

For this reason they would probably hesitate to engage in open hostilities with a fairly strong force moving up to the Sh'raz valley during the winter months, though they might resist a smaller force if they thought they could block its advance. Military Note on the‘Arms Traffic.—The chief place in the Ar,n ' T,afflo - Gulf, whence there is a small hut steady flow of arms into PersiU, is Koweit, where considerable quantities of .SOS service rifles and ammunition have been accum'dated. These have been collected from the former battle fields of Mesopotamia, from friendly tribes of that country to whom large issues of arms were made by the Government during the war, and from the tribes of the King of Hedjaz, who were well supplied with ser vice rifles for use against the Turks and are now selling off their surplus stock. These arms are exported from Koweit in two directions- By far the larger number are smuggled across in dhcws to the Persian coast between Bandar Dilam to a point about 40 miles south of Lingeh. Smaller numbers find their way across to Makian. During the first nine months of 1020 there were 600 to 800 rifles landed at v^ariors times from Koweit and its neighbour hood along the strip of coast between Bandar Dilam and Lingeh. 95 per cent of these were 'SOO service rifles, the remainder being of various types, principally Turkish Mausers. The latter type is little in demand owing to the difficulty in obtaining ammunition for : t. Each rifle is usually accom panied by about 100 rounds of ammunition. Besides this large consignments of ammunition were carried separately estimated at not less than 100,000 rounds. Practically the whole of this quantity is absorbed in the province of Pars, where, in addition to the local inhabitants, the nomad tribes provide a never ceasing demand. The proof of the abundance of service rifles now present in Pars is their price which near the coast averages about 40 to 50 Tomans (roughly 120 to 140 rupees) for a service rifle and 40 to 50 rounds The price of ammunition is 12 tomans (about 40 rupees) per ICO rounds. There are few villages along this strip of coast in which there is no less than one rifle in each family. JV 136 Between 1920 and the present time (March 1922) not more than 300—400 rifles with about 10,000 rounds of ammunition were landed on this strip of coast. This shows a considerable diminution in the numbers as compared with the figures for the first nine months of 1920, and there appears to be little doubt that the traffic generally in this area is on the wane. It is however considered that this smuggling will never cease entirely so long as surplus stocks are brought over to the Arabian Coast o f f '’e Persian Gulf and Persian officials on the opposite side con tinue their present ayatby and corruption. The recent troubles in Iraq and the subsequent disarming of the rebellious tribes brought about a greatly increased demand from that quarter with the result that a big percentage of the trade in arms across the Gulf to the Persian coast was diverted to the needs of Iraq. The coastal strip more especially frojn Bandar DiJam to the southern boundary of Dashti may be said to be well stocked with rifles, the great problem for the owners however being how to obtain ammunition. This commodity is undoubtedly scarce and shows indications of getting a good deal dearer. This emark applies particularly to ammunition for Mauser rifles brought into Persia before the Great War, and which is now prac tical y unobtainable.CHAPTER VII. Communications. Railways. —There are no railways in this area. A light Railways, railway was laid from Biishire to Borazjun (40 miles) during the operations of 1918, but this has now been dismantled. Rauls. —All routes are described in detail in ' Routes in Roads. Persia, Volume IV, Part II.” Teleyraphs.r—The following telegraph lines exist:— Telegraphs. (1) Reshire to Bushire (3 wires). Length 6 miles. 1 wire goes to the British Telegraph Office situated in the Residency. 2 wires go to the Persian Telegraph Office situated in the town ; one wire for the Ahwaz line and one for the Tehran line. [See (2) below.] Reshire to the British Residency at Sabzabad 1 wire. (2) Reshire to Tehran, via Shiraz, Isfahan and Ardistan (3 wires). Length 509 miles. Intermediate stations in this area are Borazjun, Kazarun, Shiraz, Abadeh, Isfahan and Ardistan. Of the above 3 v ires one is given over to the use of the Persian authorities for the greater part of each day. (3) A section of the international line (3 wires), running from Ardistan via Na n, Yazd and Kerman to the Indian border near KCh-i-Malik Slab, and in a nor- r therly direction to Tehran vid Kashan. In the area under review the only intermediate stations are Nam ' and Yazd. X4) Section of the line from Bf shire to Ahwaz (1 wire). Intermediate stations Bandar Rig and Bandar Dllam. A telegraph office belonging to this section has recently been opened at Ganaveh for the use of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s undertaking there.138 Telephones. Cables. This line joins the main Byshire-AhwSz line between Borazjun and Bandar B g. r The last of these belongs to the Persian Government, but is controlled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department who own and work the remainder. Telephones .—There is telephonic communication between Reshire and Bushire town. The exchange at Reshire is situat ed in one of the buildings occupied by the garrison and is con nected to the houses occupied by the- Regimental Mess, officers’ houses, the Residency at Sabzabad, to the Town Residency in Bushire, and via the Persian exchange to the Town telephone system. On the Reshire-Shraz line there is telephonic communica tion between the following intermediate offices, which with the exception of Kazarun and Borazjun are in charge of Persian ghulams:— Reshire, Ahmadi, Borazjun, Kunar Takhteh, Kazarun, Dasht-i-Arjan, Shiraz. The remainder of the landlines in this area are similarly equipped with intermediate posts which are in successive communication with each other, their average distance apart being 20—30 miles. CctWe^.—The following are the cables in this area :— (1) Respire to Jask vii Henjam, 500 nautical miles. (2) Reshire to Jask direct 522 nautical miles. (3) Reshire to Fao, 2 cables, 161 and 150 nautical miles. Telegrams can also be sent by cable from B5shire to Karachi vii cable to Jask, and thence by laud line rid Charbar, Gwadar and Pasni. All the above cables belong to the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 11 11 ireless. There are at present two wireless stations in this area, at Bushire (Reshire) and Lingrh.

The approximate radh;s of this type of installa tion, which is of the latest pattern, is 400 miles. It has com municated with Basra and with the similar R. A. F. set at Bandar ’Abbas. Pos 0$iee&lt;s.—British and Persian civil pest offices exist in Wireless, the Persian Gulf coast at Beshire, Lingeh, Henjam. Bandar ’Abbas, Jask and Charbar. At Hen jam, .fgSK and Charbar they are in charge of officials of the Indo-Furopean Telegraph De partment. Persian post offices exist at Kazariin, Shiraz and Abadeh. Letters take five days from Bushire to Shiraz. .140 CHAPTER \TH. Political. Administration. , , Jd The Government of the country consists of a Shah, a Majlis or elected National Assembly which rarely sits, and a Cabinet. The latter is nominated by the Shah, but in theory must retain the confidence of the Majlis. In practice it does not do so, but it really governs the country. The country is divided into 33 provinces, under Governor-Generals or Governors. These provinces are divided into districts, sub-districts and parishes, each in charge of officials subordinate to the Governor General or Governor. The administration is corrupt and in efficient. The dispensation of justice is always summary, but the Persian Government has no jurisdiction over foreigners, who are tried by their own Consuls, except in the case of subjects of countries which formed part of the Tsarist Russian Empire, who are subject to Persian law. (a) Fdrs. Ears is divided for administrative purposes into a number of Governments, Deputy Governments and districts (bvlnks). Next come totvns and districts under the rule of Deputy Gov- erners : such are Abadeh-i-lqlld, I)Sritb, Firuzabad, Jahrurr., Kazarfm, Qunqurl (and Bavanat) and ShlrSz (under a Eeg- lerbegi). Lastly some d'stricts (or buluke) com'' only recognized as ad- minis;.!ative units but as a rule unprovided with any definite ly responsible local authorities. A few of these on tbj coast, such as Dashti, Daud, Angali, and Chahkutah have powerful local Khans, who can control the whole district in which they residt but such men will seldom be found inland, as theexistence of powerful nomad tribes makes local a utonomy impossible.141 The following maritime districts are under the control of the Governor-General of the Gulf Ports : — Liravi. Bandar Dllam. Angal T . Haiat Daud. Chahkutah. Bushire. Lingeh and District. Bandar A bbas and BTilban District. Jask. Charbar. The remaining districts of the coastal region, Daliki, Borazjun and Tangistan are usually known as the Government of Dashti and Dashtistan subordinate to the Governor-General of Pars. Administration amongst the tribes is carried out by the ruler or supreme chief of the whole tribe who is called the Ilkhani with whom rests the responsibility of the policy of the tribe also. The Ilkhani as a rule deputises one of his relatives to act for him in the collection of revenue and the management of the internal affairs of the tribe, and this person is known as the llbegi. In addition to this every branch of the tribe has its own headman who is called the Kaldntdr and is appointed by the IlkhanT and llbegi, being subject to none save the rulers of the tribe, and he is responsible for the internal management of his own tireh or branch of the tribe. The appointment of the Chief of the Khamseh tribes is here ditary (subject to the approval of the Persian Government) in the QawamI family. Immediately under the Qawam is the Plshkdr-eh-Arab, appointed by the Qawam himself and in authority over all the Arab tribes. The flkhani of the Qashqais is appointed by the Central Government and is responsible to t,hem for the collection and payment of the revenue. Both he and the llbegi must be of direct descent from the Shahilu clan. (b) Yazd. The province of Yazd is administered by a Governor with Yazd - his headquarters in the town of Yazd.. (c) Ldristdn. Ldristdn is now subject to the Governor-General of Ears, Laristan. who however exercises little control over the province. It is142 Coinage. divided into 5 districts, Lar. Bafitak, Honniit*, Furg and Tamru. The district of Lingeh which geographically forms part of Laris- tan is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who is represent ed there by a Deputy-Governor. M iscellanexms. The unit of money in Persia is the lerdn, a silver coin, the value of whi h varies with the price of silver. At the rresent time, (March 1921), 370 krans are the equivalent of Rs. 100. The coinage consists of :— Copper .. Pal— in size to Indian pice] Used only SudKi—in size to half an | in Kho- anna.

Provisions are bought and sold by the man and of these there are seveial in use. In the accounts of the Central Government the so-called Tabriz man and its double the shdh-man only are employed.

In actual practice there is an extraordinary variation in the weights at different places. There are two main standards of w eight, one for retail work and the other for wholesale. The for mer is used by all grocers, fishmongers and greengrocers and is generally 7\ lbs. to the mnn, i.e., the Bushire or Sh raz man. This is a fairly constant weight. The wholesale weight is the Hashimi man, which is used for large purchases of grain, fodder, firewood, vegetables, etc. It is the habit when purchasing in the districts to buy without weighing; the grain is in a godown or in a heap on the ground, and the buyer makes an estimate of the quantity and bids for it. This is follow ed by extensive haggling. The Hashimi man is very elastic, ranging from 124 to 250 lbs. It is a difficult weight to deal with, as in Bushire for instance it will vary from 124 to 140 lbs. according to the article being purchased, and also according to whether the season has been favourable or the reverse. The chief articles affected by the seasonal changes are grain and fodder. Wood is always bought and sold at 140 lbs. to the man. Vegetables in bulk are144 Liquids.
