It is not possible U&gt; treat Zayani as a person deported urder Bahrain Order in Council, he will be told that he will not be allowed to land in Bahrain. Should Zayani return to the Gulf and give cause for action within the territories to which the j-ersian Coasts and islands order in Council applies he can be treated as a Foreigner and if you think it advisable dealt with as such under the deportation provisions oi that Order. But this is only possible if the Shaikh of Bahrain cedes juris- -diction in respect of him your first step should therefore be to obtain document to this eflect from Shaikh and it had better cover remaining deportees also. Similarly since # Bahrain subjects are regarded as British protected persons outside Bahrain, zayani can be dealt with as a British sub- ect -under the deportations of the Muscat Order in Council within the limits of its operation. ^.bove also applies r to other deportees who are all presumably Bahrain subjects.

She wet h: !♦ That your petitioner is a Resident of Bahrin in the Persian Gulf, a subject of the independent Arab Ruler Shaikh Essa bin All Alkhalifa and is of the age of 67 years • 2» Your petitioner belongs to a very ancient and highly respectable family of Bahrin and is a Pearl Merchant* As a spiritual Leader of an Arab tribe, your petitioner is esteemed and respected and occupies a high position in the tribe* 5* About 3 years ago, your petitioner came to Bombay at a time when there was considerable excitement and discontent among the people of Bahrin in consequence of certain high handed acts of the British Consul* The complaints of the leading and respectable Inhabitants were disregarded and the Consul and Consul General forced Shaikh Essa to abdicate and installed his eldest son^ on the Gadi against the remontrances of the Ruler and to the great dis-satisfaction of his people who resented this interference of the British Officials in the internal administration of a free and independent State in the Persian Gulf* 1+.I4.. On your petitioner's return to Bahrin abouv the month of Jure 1923, the people appealed to him for the help and advice and they were so incensed that they seriously contemplated miggrating from Bahrin in a body if their Just grievances were not redressed, your petitioner advised them to submit to the Consul General, a respectful petition detailing their grievances and praying for redress. A petition to which your petitioner was a signatory, was accordingly presented but which evoked no response though it was signed by leading and prominent people with large stake in the welfare and orderly Rule of Bahrin. 5 # Another petitions was thereupon prepared for submission to the Consul General and it was presented to him on his arrival at Bahrin. Six days elapsed with- -out any reply and on the 7th day, in the beginning of November I925, the Consul General convened a Meeting of 12 Chiefs and Nobles of Bahrin. 6« Your petitioner and Shaikh Ahmed bin LaheJ were given seats in a room in the Consulate apart from the others and the Consul notified to us in the tiame of the British Government that we were prisoners and would be deported from Bahrin# We were not informed of any offence or transfression or called upon for an explana tion . We were kept as Prisoners in the room without food and at sun-set on the same day, we were taken on Board, a man-of-war, which was in readiness and were kept under the custody of 5 Military men. We were then taken to Busra where we were kept for two days and were then placed under the same custody on Board, the Mail Steamer and were brought to Bombay. After our arrival on or about the 12th November 1925 we have been kept at the Shah-Jahan Palace Hotel in Sitaram Building, near Crawford Market and have been detained under the orders of the Police Ooratnissioner&lt;» On the ^rd instant we were/^\ 5b were informed by a Police Officer that we would sobrtr^e carried to some unknown and unrevealed destination and we are apprehensive of being subjected to ill-treatment and deprived of our liberty. 7* Your petitioner says that upto the present day, he is absolutely in the dark as to the circumstances and reasons of his deportation and detention k In Bombay In Police custody and all his inquiries as to what is charged against him, have been futile and unavailing. Your petitioner is apprehensive that he will soon be removed out of the Jurlsdiction of this Hobble Court and placed beyond reach of redress. Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that Your Lordships will be pleased to direct the Commissioner of Police,that he may be brought up before the Court to be dealt with according to Law and that he be set at liberty.
