Wo. 2898-3/16, The 24th November 1936. ■/hen I went to see the Senior Naval Officer on your behalf In connection with certain business, he mentioned the question of Captain adhan's call (see my letter Ko. 2755.3/18 dated the 6th Hovember 1936) and said that he would be very grateful if we would let him have an authoritative statement of the precedence to 'be observed In calls between Naval Officers and (a) Shaikhs and (b) Political Agents* His ovm records were f he explained, scanty and evidently, from the Wadham ca8e f not to be relied on. I said that I would let you know. 2» In the course of conversation I explained the position so far as it concerned Bahrain, that is to sayt- (1) that the Shaikh calls first upon (a) the Naval Commander-in-Chief, (b) the Senior Navel Officer, Persian Gulf and (c) a Captain acting as Senior Officer, Persian Gulf in the absence of the Senior Naval Officer. (11) that all other Naval Officers (I do not include cliance visits of Officers of rank higher than Captain ) call upon the Shaikh rirst. (ill) that the I-olitical Agent ordinarily calls upon the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Oulf (I assume that the Senior Naval Officer is not likely The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T«C* Fowle, C«B»E« Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIHE. ilikely to be below the mnk of Captain f In wtiich ceee the mtter would need consideration) and upon Gaptnlna first. Kaval Off leers below the rank of Captain call on the Political Agent first* (iv) that in my own cace, there le the unusual event of a Political A^ent so senior that he holds personal rank higher than that of his office i«e« Captains appointed after the Ifith ! arch 1936 cell upon roe first (see Article 36 of the Varrant of Precedence for India)* It is therefore, possible to have a Political Agent senior to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, (if a Captain) as the Senior Kaval Officer's post carries no precedence of its own, though we have always done all we can to emphaaise the importance of the Senior Kaval Officer in the eyer of the local inhabitanta* 3* I would only add in regard to (iv) above that so far as I personally am concerned I would be perfectly willing to sink my personal precedence in the case of the Senior Kaval officer, if it was thought desirable to do so for political reasons. /) ^ . cM 1 D.O.

Semi-official calls could continue, but clearly this must be a standing rule for all occasions during the war; and if for instance the Commander- in-Chief visited Bahrain by any chance the Political Agent's call on nim would equally be made in mufti and in a semi-orfi- cial manner.

I called on the Captain at 9.30 A.M using the Agency launch flying flag on the stern. It was arranged that the Captain should call on Kis Excellency Shaikh Kamad at 9.30 A.M at his Manama Palace on the 13th April 1933 and before doing so he will return my call at the Agency. The question of His Excellency's return call,however,was kept undecided as the Captain was anxious to have the honour of giving the increased number of guns to the Shaikh from his man-of-war. 2.

The only precedent in the file is exchange of calls with Commander Back H.M.S. Lupin on 30th September. I asked Mr. Thomas to write this up but it has not been entered yet. This procedure adopted was similar to that proposed by me for the coming exchange of calls. A letter should be written to H.E. Shaikh Hamed, also letters to the Adviser and the Director of Customs giving the time of arrival of sloops. }, ill .&gt;■ i i ! Sd/- M. Worth, 6-11-34. Discussed with P.A. H.C. Please write to Adviser and Director of Customs at once and say that H.M.S. Fowey will be arriving at Bahrain on November 7th probably in the forenoon. M.W. 6/11.-2- (ToV The letter about calls was not issued, as S.N.O. was in harbour* 2. The programme is suitable, but possibly we could cut down the time a little. 3. V/hen the Commanding Officer is a Captain - P.A. calls first- v/hat has Shaikh done in the past? One matter which should be avoided is a Captain getting a Guard of Honour on landing, v/hich is an honour due only to the Naval C-in-C and given by local courtesy to the S.N.O. G .L. 10-11-34. P.A.

Shaikh Hamed, Commanding ^ it 1 A Officer appears to have called first * I.A. was officiating as P.A. had left for Bushire. D. There is no note about the visit of Commanding ♦Captain Browne was S.0*P.G. Officer - a Captain of H.M.S. Bideford except this letter. In this case H.E. Shaikh Hamed called first . When C.O. returned call p.A. accompanied him - also A.P.A.- if I remember rightly. Captain Browne was at this time S.N.O.P.G. as S.N.O.P.G. was in Bombay. On the face of it, it would seem correct that j if P.A. calls first, H.E. should do so also. As for shortening suggested programme we might be able to do this by shortening calls but I took into consideration transit times. Previous Guard of Honour was intended for Shaikh only. It happened to be drawn up by Director of Customs before Commanding Officer of H.M.S. Lupin came ashore. We can arrange for this not to occur again. M. Worth, 10-11-34. (fiee next page),/v {&amp;) Vide p.86 of Vol.II File 3/3. Captain Denison on 22-10-32 asked when he should call on the Shaikh and from this it appears that toe called first . He was not S.O.P.G. at the time. E.Worth. 10-11-34. Thanks. In order to obviate any possible misunder standings in future, I think that we should always have return calls or calls on board and not at the Agency. If the weather is bad the calls had better be postponed. Secondly, we must so arrange the coming off that officers other than H.E. the Naval Commander-in-Chief ( by courtesy the S.N.O.) do not come into contact with the Guard of Honour. 2. These notes should be typed up. Then as occasions arise we will draw up a specimen programme for each kind of call, to be used as a ,f sealed pattern'. G.L. 12-11-34.IMM- • 1 ' * *P.A .

P.l/e Please see Captain Crabbe's Memorandum re: Formal F.j•a/6. Calls. 'Formal calls to be exchanged when Commanding Officers v visit the ports named for the first time after assuming command' The expression 'formal calls' gave rise to considerable mis understanding and in 1933 after an interview with the S.N.O.P.G S.No:44. (Captain Creagh) the Acting P.A (Captain Gastrell) noted on F.l.a/8, 13.8.19^5 that 'All visits by His Majesty's Ships are o fficial i d\ ~~~~ and calls between H.M's Ships, the P*A and the Ruler should be made with full ceremonial.' Captain Creagh also informed P.APlease make enquiries why the 'Diana' was not at Jufair Pier at 14.89 hours today,December 23rd, as ordered. I wish to know exact repponsiftility. I had to alter plans and use H.M. SDeptford's motor boat. H.C. 23.12.35 Finding David here at about 13-30 hours today 1 as^ea him whether he had no instructions from the A.P.i.. yesteraay about taxing the 'Diana' to Julair Pier at, 14 nours He said 'no'. I instructed him to taxte i.i»e to Jufair Pier at ouoe. I also caiiea to lae omce and read over the sentence at p. 67 ; 'Liana' snouia oe at Jufair Pier from 14-00 hours' and told him your plans, i.e. that on ttaxreturn from the 'Deptford' you would disemuarx: at the R-A.F. pier {see note at p. 67) Will A. P. A. please enquire into this. Directly it was Known that A. P. A. was ill Office shd have seen that the orders reached David, if they had not alrod ^y been given. 2. It pats the P.A. in an undignified position when 81 he has to 'borrow a launch after having sent out/complete programme. A.P.A. 23.12.35 Letter au page bb was faired and issued on the 22rid December 1^35• H.G. states that he sent the file to mj office to issue onie-rs to launch crew etc at 09.00 nou^s on the 22nd December 1935. I did not see iile in my olxice and the-re was nothing pending when I left of-Tice at lunch time/-h h time on the EEnd December iS35. I knew about calls however as I was with P./v. most of that moming and P.A. told me of the alteration in times. I did not come to office on the ^3rd December 1935, so presumably the file was left in my office if it was there. I cannot however remember seeing the file and if it had been in my office I would have intialled the note sheet. I don 't think David can be blamed, as he ^ceived no orae^s ana either the R.G. or myself must be held to olame. ) '7 It seems clear that the file did not reach A.P.A. on the morning of the 22nd December. But in any case ,as A.P.A. had gone sick,arrangements shd have been checked on the 23rd by H.C.
