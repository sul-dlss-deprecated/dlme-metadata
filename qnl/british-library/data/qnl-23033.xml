It is stated on the voucher by Mr.Ringrow 'Authorised to receive Mr.A.J.Smales* Pay' and Mr.Ringrow has evidently signed for Mr.A.J.Smales. There is however no letter of Mr.Smales addressed to us asking us to pay the sum to Mr.Ringrow. May confirm that the payment was made to Mr.Smales through Mr.Ringrow. Quer^y-ll : This relates to Voucher No.50 of December 1948 Quarter Account flagged below. There is some confusion about this. The Voucher for Salary for the month of August 1948 (Flagged 'A' in September 1948 Account below) shows that Mr.Jasim actually received Rs.604/- only and not 625/- F.O. points out that the payment is Rs*625/- because, in the schedule for September 1948 Quarter, prepared by Mr.Johnson, the salary of Mr.Jasim for August is shown as Rs*625/- (Vide Voucher 53 on Schedule 3 of Sep.Quarter a/c flagged below). The Cash book shows a payment of Rs.604/- only for August* It is not understandable as to how the Account for September Quarter tallied iri^xkhRxihHXKakxxJa cash book showing a particular - payment as Rs.604/- and the Schedule showing the same payment as Rs.625/- I have referred the matter to Mr.Jasim who has agreed to communicate to me the actual amount received by him after referring to Sharjah Office records on his arrival there. v Query-12 : The Passport Clerk may be able to answer this query. Query-13 : We have started ledgers only from September 1949 Quarter from when onwards we will be able to send trial balances. i/*~g. (6Ly fY c? . v * Mo . f J- 3 — c f s^~ ^ ' h 5~o tlv .

(Ministry of Pensions, H.M.Stationery Office etc. are examples for this). Regarding para 6 of the circular, we have writtento M.O.W. xaclxa London suggesting that in future they should furnish us funds by Telegraphic Transfers,. We have not as yet heard from them in the matter and if they agree the accounting procedure of M.O.W. will in future be on the ,.lines of item (a) of Para 2 and the present system on.thelines of item (b) of the same para will have to be changed.

S'~1 A Para 4 of Appendix A : This requirement will be complied with in future. The accounts that are to be shown in the balance certificate as on date are the Agency F.O.a/c and the Agency M.O.W. a/c. From June 1950 quarter, F.O.Account ’’B” and M.O.P account if we we have to open a separate account for them will also be included. The answers to the queries therefore are:- *uery: 11 &amp; Query: 12 : ’’NOTED FOR FUTURE GUIDANCE” S. 15: Query 18 : The amalgamation of Sharjah account with ours was done in accordance with the instructions of Mr.Jakins. Now that F.O. do not want it that way, we-shall submit the Sharjah accounts independently in future. -Query 19: ^ To tactept thfr system prescribed in this query, we shall have to transfer all the amounts so far debited to“the ”Doha'Agency” account in our books to the 'Suspense account'. At the end of the Quarter, when the Doha total expenditure for the quarter is known, the like amount should be credited to the suspense account. This will leave the amount outstanding against Doha as debit in our suscense « account. The* foregoing change is suggested in respect of March quarter account only. From April onwards whenever advances are made to Doha the amount may be straightaway debited to Suspense account as indicated in the query. Query 20: Our December Quarter accounts were submitted more or less on the same lines as required as per the query. More attention will be paid to this requirement in future. ST SI / u? o l f' b Query 21 : The present procedure with regard to the accounting of the Bahrain Post Office Deposits is approved. Instruc tions in respect of the procedure to be adopted effective 1st April for the accounting of P.0, deposits are already in hand and will be carefully followed from that date. gtggKXX&amp;g XXXtofcgdtxgBXXfKfcKggXgHi&amp;aHKg • C) iu x QgsaocxS&amp; x xSfcgxaoiHimfcxliatxxfeggJixxgKBncgrgdt Query 22 : I raised this question when the inspectors were here and Mr.Patterson was good enough to explain as to how the Exchange Adjustment is to be done showing me some j examples. w I believe I shall be able to do it in the ix correct manner in my March Quarter accounts. Query 23 : I think C.O. might be having correspondence on the subject of Mission Fund. I have no knowledge as to an allocation of a particular sum for this expenditure for a fixed period. I presume however that we might not have exceeded a limit if there was one under this head as expenses under this head are very few and far between. The requirement regarding a Certificate signed by H.E. the Political Resident will have to be complied with by getting a certificate so signed for each quarter. Query 24: The item referred to in the query is now cleared. The sum of Rs.2/- has since been recovered from Sharjah and credited to the Foreign Office account in our March quarter account. 1 / u From the foregoing therefore the following answers to the queries from 18 to 24 in S.15 would seem approptiate:-2 V INDIA OFFICE RECORDS</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000320_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1161</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000320</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1161</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 4/53 F.O. a/c Queries.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-17T11:47:08</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (44 folios)</extent><extent>The correspondence is arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file, and terminates with a set of notes between folios 38-45.
