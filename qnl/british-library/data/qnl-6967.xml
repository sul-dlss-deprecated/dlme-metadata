The Emie Feisal * (see note) found it increasingly difficult to maintain a moderating influence. Until November, 1919, he was able to maintain partial control, matters however, reached a climax when he w T as informed by His Majesty's Government that he should go to Paris and negotiate direct with the French, from whom he obtained little or no satisfaction. The result was, the extremists triumphed and Feisal himself bitterly disappointed lost his last vestige of control of the situation. From this period (November, 1919) events moved rapidly and it will be necessary to follow them as closely as the information at our disposal will allow. Appendix p. n. Feisal expresses himself to Zaqlul Pashas as being now bitterly anti-British, whilst Fuad al Katib his private secretary, ordinarily the most moderate of men, expresses similar feeling in verses vilifying the British that find their way to Syria, Switzerland and Berlin. i5.ii.i9. About the 15th November, 1919, a very important meeting was held at Montreux . This meeting was presided over by Talaat who was specially summoned from Berlin but he did Appendix p. ii. not show himself until Feisal's representative had arrived. The object of the meeting was to discuss proposals (a) for a defensive alliance between the Damascus Government and Mustafa Kemal (b) to unite all the Chiefs of Arabia on a pan-Islamic basis, (c) to ask the King of the Hedjaz to head the movement and to forget all rivalry and personal jealousies for the good of the common cause. 2.12 .19 ^ I1 01 ' December, 1919, Zaki Pasha Khersa arrived at the Belle Vue Palace ITotel in Berne where he met Amir Shakib Arsalan and delivered to him a message for Talaat Pasha to the effect that Feisal entirely concurred in the arrangements agreed to 7.1.20. tfie meeting at Montreux . Another meeting was held at St. Mortiz ; Talaat Pasha and Amir Shakib Arsalan attended this meeting discussed the possibility of an alliance between the Bolshevists, Enver, Mustafa Kemal and the Arabs . The result of this conference was Appendix p. 11. evidently communicated to Amir Feisal , for in December (the exact date is doubtful) Amir k hakib Arsalan receives a letter from him saying he has the greatest confidence in his work— whilst evidently with reference to the above proposals he says he cannot agree to the above alliance unless the complete independence of Syria and Mesopotamia is recognised bv Enver Moscow, and Turkey . He further authorised Amir Shakib Arsalan to go to Moscow to sound It 10 ae in anti-British oncWours. ally.

Amongst the conditions laid down by Mustafa Kemal in his negotiations opened by Mr. S teen with the Foreign Office, F.O. 1054 dated 20.8.20, the former engages:— (a) to disband his troops ; (b) To abolish the organization of Anti-British propaganda and the agitation kept up by his agents in Mesopotamia, Cilicia, India, Caucasus, Persia, etc. Mustafa Kemal therefore does not attempt to conceal his activities in Mesopotamia. Extract from a letter from M ustafa K emal to S alih P asha late Grand V iziee about 19th March 20 :—' The grievous results of British policy in the whole of the H edjaz realm and the operations of the forces of E amazan S halash and his companions in the neighbourhood of Baghdad have produced a wave of opinion that would do away with the kingdom of the Hedjaz. Several Arab chiefs belonging to the same race and encouraged by these facts have given expression to ideals and plans which they have nourished secretly for some time. Thus the movement is openly expanding to Mesopotamia and Syria. As most of the directors among the Arab I atnots belong to the influential and intelligent classes of the Ottoman Empire, and as this movement has its mainspring in Islam, our National organization has been welcomed warmly and with confidence by the Nationalists in Mesopotamia and Syria. The representative body which takes in all movements in the Arab Towns and which is working solely to strengthen its position has done all in its nower to fan and increase this wave of opinion. ^ QT .

A very great number of these exist in Turkey, Anatolia and Syria , and we find in tracing their activities that they link up eventually with Constantinople and Switzerland and from there Appendix p. 8. w ith the Foreign Office in Germany. They are formed generally for some specific political Appendix p! 12! purpose, to ' tap ' as it were a new source of activity. We generally find that they contain the extremists elements and eventually exercise either singly, or in alliance with one another, powerful influence on the locally directing council or assembly. If we are correct in our appreciation of the intentions of our enemies, we find that a nationalist movement must be linked up with a religious, or anti-Christian movement. To exemplify this we must briefly note the activities of three such organizations. The Nadi-al-Aeabi and Elahd in Syria and the Mouvahiddin Society* in Angora . The former started fairly quietly in Damascus , become more and more extreme as time went on—until it has become completely pan-Islamist and in consequence Anti-European. It had by this time several branches including those in Aleppo and Constantinople and was in touch with Mesopotamian Nationalists. It is strikingly similar to the Mouvahiddin with whom it quickly allied itself. From several sources we have information that it exercised a powerful influence on the Damascus Congress. Mustafa Kemal writing in March 19, says—' The propaganda published by the two Arab papers appearing at Aleppo and Damascus which are subsidised fitly by us is due to the efforts of several Arab patriots amongst whom is Lieut.-Col. Izzet Bey and to the suggestions of the veterans of the Nida-ul-Arab.' The following is a useful illustration of the form of instructions issued by the Headquarters of this Society at Damascus.

Appendix p. 8 There is no advantage to be gained by discussing it at length and it is sufficient to say that it has had a considerable share in the pan-Islamist aspect of the trouble. Appendix p. 10. The Mouvahiddin Society was convened on November 11th, 1919, at Sivas —like the Nadi-al-Arabi it is extreme pan-Islamist, it recognises as its only object ' the assurance of acquisition by every possible means the independence and liberty of all Muslim countries living under foreign and Christian protection,' a point of great interest is that action to achieve this purpose had been taken before its first meeting was held. In a short time it had merged itself with the Nationalist Movement, had combined with the N adi-al-Arabi and claimed to have branches at Damascus, Homs, Baalek, Eeshid, Haifa, Aleppo, Baghdad, Nejf and Koweit. Appendix, p. 4. E L A HI) the Mesopotamian League is composed of Mesopotamians of whom there are about 300 in Feisal's service. They were nearly all in Turkish Military employment. They are the leading personalities in the Arab State, and hold all the Military posts. This Society has carried out intensive propaganda throughout Mesopotamia and several documents of a hostile nature have been discovered bearing its seal. It was responsible for organizing the Mesopotamian pro-Turkish elementsf referred to earlier in the report. We must now recapitulate. The meeting of Montreux proposed (a) a defensive alliance between the Damascus Government and Mustafa Kemal. This undoubtedly was agreed to though French action forstalled any advantage being taken of it, {b) to unite all the Chiefs of Arabia on a pan-Islamist basis. It was the task of the two Societies mentioned to achieve this. Our information from Baghdad, Mecca, Eiadh, is sufficient to prove the scope and effectiveness of their efforts, (c) to ask the King of the Hedjaz to put himself at the head of the movement (Jihad ). Without doubt he has been approached in the matter for we know that messengers passed to and from Constantinople, Damascus and Mecca and Eaidh. Finally a very interesting document has fallen into our hands which has yet to be proved to be genuine but which fits in so well in the general scheme as to make it appear to be so. It is dated Najaf-i-Sherif , May 24th, 1920, signed Abbas , Secretary to the Spiritual Chief of Nejaf, and is addressed to Mustafa Kemal , thanking him for the letters and presents he sent to the spiritual head of Najaf-i-Sherif , promises him, full support for the preaching of a Jihad , to send the ' necessary instructions to agents in Baluchistan, Persia, India and Hadramuth,' to send a delegate ' who will be provided with all requisite powers ' to the Islamic Congress at Angora , and asks for 15,000 pounds in gold. * Note. —This Society has definitely proclaimed itself pro-Bolshevik. It has its representative in Moscow, and has converted 105 members of the Great National Assembly of Angora to Bolshevik principles. t Note. — Y usuf S uwaidi in his interview with S aiyed T alib at B aghdad on 28th July, 1920, said :—' The Nationalist party has been at work for six months and has accomplished marvels.' Compare the above period with that selected as being necessary to organise the disturbances. 24.5.20.SECRET. Chart Showing Inter-Connection oJ the various Intriguing Elements BERLIN. SWITZERLAND.

That until we have done so we can hope for no permanent respite from dangers or outbreaks in every direction. The examination of the mass of information placed at my disposal confirms me in mv strong belief that the various secret societies receive their inspiration from a comparativelv small central organization that we may track down by a process of careful and methodical elimination. It is clear that Mustafa Kemal and the Amir Feisal are both instruments for the furtherance of far vaster schemes than those with which they personally have to deal. We see this clearly illustrated in the case of Mustafa Kemal by his constant hopes that the Entente b y granting Tuikey more favourable terms such as the retention of Smyrna would allow him to refuse extraneous assistance. We see it in his hatred of the Arab with whom he is forced to ally himself, throughout his negotiations with the Bolshevists and with Enver, and in his circular to newspapers subsidised by him, not to be too violent in their attacks on the Entente and especially in his distaste of the Pan-Islamist programme—yet, we find, in spite of himself he is forced to use all these for the furtherance of schemes with which he has no sympathies. A close study of Feisal's attitude throughout reveals the same helplessness against this outside influence he too has clearly fallen a victim to the extremists. Thus we see that the extremist parties gradually organize into various societies obtain a decisive influence in the councils of their respective spheres, and having obtained this influence, become linked up with each other. This policy is being still further pursued in the endeavour to link up with Enver's activities and the Bolshevist movement. A study of our evidence reveals another very significant fact, namely that plans are already prepared ready for execution when a new society is brought into being or a party lends its allegiance to the general scheme. For instance when the Mouvahiddin Society was inaugurated in Sivas we find that certain steps had already been taken in anticipation of the resolutions it is about to pass, in other words it is an adjunct to a scheme already in being and is formed to help bring about a political ' coup ' to achieve which, other agencies have been in motion for some time. Again we see this in the negotiations on behalf of Feisal and Talaat Pasha , tw T o conferences are sufficient to provide the means whereby he may hope to attain his ends and though he does not fall in with the whole scheme when presented to him, in a tentative manner, other agencies are at work to bring this full co-operation about. Yet another important factor helping to prove the control of the movement by agencies outside Anatolia, Syria, and Baghdad, is the frequent references ' to await our instructions. The Vali of Daibekir instructs one ' Mishel ' to w^ait for a certain event Ajaimi ^aadun when he displays anxiety to attack is told by the Minister of War at Constantinople to wait patiently for the time when he will be let loose. The tribes in Mesopotamia a^ instructed by the Mujtahids to arm themselves and await instructions. When we find in addition that the Nationalists and Syrian extremists and the various societies are hnked up to Switzerland and from Switzerland to Berlin the controlling forces are still further reduced. These we have vet to AM Because we find the threads leading to Berlin and Moscow it by no means proves that we have reached the end of our investigations, we have only commenced them.
