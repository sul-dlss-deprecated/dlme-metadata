With reference to the attached copy of the correspondence noted below regarding certain irregularities which have been brought to light in connection with the administration and command of the Muscat State Levy Corps by Captain A. R. Walker, 2nd Bn., 11 th Sikh Regiment (at present on leave in the United Kingdom up to 3rd February 1932). Details of Government employees used by Captain Walker as personal retainers. Copy of a Report dated 5th August 1931 from Mr. S. E. Hedgcock, F.A. to the Political Agent and H. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat, together with a copy of Appendices B and C referred to therein. After the contents thereof have been communicated to him, Captain Walker should be called upon to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, an explanation of the allegations made therein, and at the same time, be requested to state whether he is prepared to refund to the Muscat State the monies alleged to have been irregularly received by him. 2. With regard to paragraphs 2—4 of the above noted report, relating to the pay overdrawn by Captain Walker, whilst Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. It has been ruled that although Indian Army Allowance was not admissible to him, Captain Walker was entitled to draw Lodging Allowance at the existing rate, for the period in question, despite the fact that he was provided with free furnished quarters. The amount overdrawn by Captain Walker on this account should, thetefore, read Rs. 1,065 only and not Rs. 3,650 as shown in the correspondence referred to above. 3 . The item on account of dog’s food included in Appendix B is considered too trivial to be recovered and should, therefore, be deducted from the total of Rs. 1,791 shown in that Appendix, thereby reducing the sum to Rs. 1,651. 4 . Captain Walker’s statement, if any, should be forwarded to these Headquarters together with an expression of the opinion and recommenda tions of all forwarding authorities, &gt; L545(c)F&amp;PD ENOLOsuiit iN lMDlA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter iyj 0 ft 76 .vi, 1S DhC. 1932 R'seu-1 2 JAN. 1933End. 1 in S.

C. dated 15th February 1932, from the Officer Commanding 2 nd Bn., 11 th Sikh Regiment. From Captain Walker’s explanation, I consider that he was not guilty ot any evasion or misrepresentation in the matter under reference. He evidently sought rulings from Mr. Thomas and from the C M A when possible and he appears to have acted in good faith and apparently in accordance with what was done by his predecessor. I consider that the system of employing' enrolled Levy personnel as personal servants was certainly not a satisfactory procedure but it was apparently the custom followed by former Commandants of the Muscat Levy Corps and consequently Captain Walker continued the system. I am of opinion however, that it was an error of judgment of Captain Walker’s part in not getting written confirmation from the C. M. A. regarding his pay and it now appears that he is liable to a claim for the refund of the difference between the Indian Army Allowance and Lodging Allowance. Enel. 2 in S. No. ( 4 ).

G.- 8 , dated 18th January 1932 and enclosures thereto. 2 . I have read Captain Walker’s statement and have, in addition, discussed the whole question with him in considerable detail. The administrative difficulties which Captain Walker had to contend with in Muscat were considerable, as there were no regulations for his Levy Corps and he frequently had to make tentative decisions himself owing to the absence of his superiors. I do not agree with the allegation made by Mr. Hedgcock that Captain Walker avoided referring matters to higher authorities, or that he was guilty of evasion and misrepresentation. I am of the opinion that Captain Walker invariably sought a ruling at the first opportunity from Mr. Thomas, the Finance Minister, if he was in the slightest doubt as to the legalitv of anv expenditure. It was an error of judgment on his part that such rulings were usually “verbal” instead of “written” ones. 3. As regards the money which Captain Walker is alleged to have charged wrongfully to the Muscat State. I am of opinion that Captain Walker’s explanations are satisfactory in respect of items under the following headings:— Personal Servants Rs. 7,057 Miscellaneous privileges • • . # ■ 1,791 I. M. W. 0. Contribution • • , . 855 Leave passages • . .. 2644. As regards excess pay: Walker is not certa in about the Owing to the lapse ol tiin P Muscat State neither can he exact teri of his oragmal ’the C.

I do not consider, however, that I am in a position to express an opinion on this point, aiid I am not forwarding the documents as one of them is a private letter which the writer would probably regard as privileged. 8. As regards Captain Walker himself:— X consider he has a very even temperament and that he is not of a quarrelsome nature. ■reisome nature.

G.- 8 , dated 18th January 1932 — I attdeh herewith my detailed answers to the allegations made against me by Mr. Hedgcock. 1 can conscientiously say that throughout my three years in Muscat I acted in good faith, and I did not draw any benefit or allowance unless I was fully satisfied that they were fully authorised. I also invariably obtained the sanction of Mr. Thomas, Finance Minister to the State, to all items of expenditure about which I was in doubt. 1 I would, therefore, most respectfully represent that I did not receive any monies “irregularly” which call for refund.APPENDIX A. Answer to Mr. Hedgecock's D.-O.’s of 5th August 1931. ]. To answer the assertions contained in this letter it is necessary to stan at the very beginning of my time in Muscat, but I am somewhat handicapped as I have no files to refer to. 2 . While in Peshawar in 1928 ; a circular letter came round asking for the services of a Captain recommended as Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. I applied for and obtained this post. I have discussed 'the coDditions in the letter in Appendix E attached. 3. As the notice for my appointment was very brief I wired to the Commandant, asking if there was electricity and if servants could be obtained. He replied that there was no electricity but that a full staff of servants was available. I therefore took only my bearer. ^ 4. On arrival I took over the house and staff en bloc from Captain Stephens the commandant. I he latter told me that the staff was composed of enrolled Levy personnel and that the commandant only paid them an allowance in addition to their State pay. I therefore continued to employ them under identically the same conditions. Nearly all the people referred to in Mr. Hedgecock’s Appendix A had served with at least two or three commandants under the same conditions. This I confirmed from themselves, the Subadar Major and the Regimental Clerk'. The two latter had accompanied the Levy Corps from Seistan from whence it originated. 5. At this time Mr. Bertram Thomas who was Financial Adviser and Finance Minister to the State was away in England with His Highness the Sultan. Soon after my arrival it occurred to me that I might elect to take the new rates of pay With advantage. Being in some doubt as to what these were and having no other means of finding out, I wrote to the C. M. A.. Quetta on the subject. 6 . He replied that under the old rates of pay I was not entitled to I. A. Allowance, but that under the new rates he presumed that I would be entitled to draw pay (at Rs. 655) I. A. Allowance (at Rs. 100) Marriage Allowance (at Rs. 100 ) but not to Lodging Allowance (at Rs. 75). The C. M. A. did not give the figures shown in brackets. * 7. As I did not know at the time what these figures were T wrote to the adjutant of my regiment to find out and in the meantime underdrew what I considered I was entitled to. At the end of November 1928 I had to submit a budget for the Levy Corps for 1929. I had received the rates of pay and allowance from the adjutant. This budget had to be approved by Air. Thomas on his return. In order to produce a budget to which alterations would not have to be made and being quite sure that T was entitled to the new rates of pay as shown by the C. M. A. I submitted my pay rate at Rs. 1,255 and to settle the accounts in 1928 drew back pay for six months to bring the figures up to Rs. 1,255 for that period, i.g. from 1 st June 1928. 1 I have never heard or seen that the Rs. 400 granted by Muscat State was composed partly of command pay and partly climatic allowance. I looked upon it' as an inducement to attract an officer to such an outlandish place, and still do so. 8 . When submitting my budget on Mr. Thomas’s return I talked to him and explained all the details of my pay. I told him I was entitled to elect the new rates of pay at any time and had decided to do so from 1 st June 1928. I pointed out to him that the sum of Rs. 1,255 did not include lodsring allowance as the C. M. A. had presumed that I was not entitled to it, but as the house was free, I myself thought I was. I agreed; however, not to claim it as I was drawing more than Captain Stephens had drawn owing to having over ten years seniority. i r *5;c) f&amp;pd ,6 Mr. Thomas then agreed to my drawing Rs. 1,255 from June 1928. I had explained to him that my pay was made up ol pav ^ b A J 1 i’ a e Allowance at Rs. 100, Marriage Allowance at Rs. 100 and Muscat ALowance at Rs. 400. Mr. Hedpecock’s statement that I did not refer the matter to higher authority is therefore a mis-statement of fact. Naturally there is not record of this conversation for Mr. Hedgecock to see. 9 . On several occasions I had talks with Mr. Thomas in his office about things I wanted done but had not thought of when submitting the budget and for which I wanted sanction. I nless it was a large matter which might materially affect any item in the budget Mr. Thomas would grant sanc tion and let it sro at that. 10. The Indian Military Widows’ and Orphans’ Pension Fund had been paid by the State from the t ; me of the first Commandant, as far as I can remember. I never doubted that it was included in the conditions under which I joined the Levy Corps 11. The objection raised by Mr. Hedgecock to sea passages occurred when I presented my budget for 1931. Owing to financial stringency I had considerably reduced the original budget to a figure which the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had wanted. Mr. Hedgecock wanted a still further reduction under passages but I pointed out to him that passages had always been granted to the commandant and Indian Officers and their wives. I quoted a case to him where Mrs. Stephens had been granted a passage, and 1 believed, a railfare also when going to Kashmir and I did not refer to her final passage taken when rejoining Captain Stephens’ unit at Kotwara. . ln m 7 ow n case however, I personally asked Mr. Thomas if my wife was entitled to a leave passage to Karachi as well as myself. He stated that she was. but that she could not claim any railway concessions. This I had never asked for nor expected. T remember this case particularly well as, at the same time I obtained special permission from the Council of Ministers hrough Mr. Thomas to take my month’s leave due from 1928 in combination wTiruiL fu Ve £ rante( ? 101929 and also to proceed a week earlier than I unfit to“laione.

Muscat th,-A.- ■ •&gt; ' 7 7 teDt c , warm jerseys tor the men and a motor lorry to replace uneconomical camels were all introduced during 1 this time. In addition, the Levy constructed a motor road between Muscat and Muttrah over four miles of extremely difficult cliff country over which it had always been thought impossible to build a road. With the help of some old gunpowder from the forts, this road was constructed at a cost of some Rs. 1,600, the original budget figures not being exceeded as savings were effected in other directions. This road was badly wanted by the state as the only means of communication between the two towns was by boat. It would have cost lakhs if it had been put into the hands of a contractor. This work was the subject of a letter of congratulation to all ranks from the Government of India and Army Headquarters. .17. The question of my doing a third year in Muscat was raised by Major Fowle the Political Agent. I wanted to go on leave but remaining iii Muscat had the advantage that I should miss a tour of duty with my battalion in Fort Sandeman where I could not take my wife. After obtaining my Commanding Officer’s permission, I remained for an extra year. 18. All the complaints Mr. Hedgecock makes are of happenings which occurred in Mr. Thomas’s time. When Mr. Hedgecock came to Muscat Mr. Thomas was away in the Ruba’al Khali. He returned soon afterwards and stayed for a week. From the very start Mr. Hedgecock’s manner to me was most disagree able, and although I did all I could to work amicably with him, I found it extremely difficult to remain on speaking ( terms with him, Major Fowle can corroborate this. During the period when Mr. Hedgecock was trying to reduce the Levy to the standard of a kind of Khassadar force, his proposals were not accepted by the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who had heard both sides of the question. In a fit of pique Mr. Hedgecock tendered his resignation. I believe it was accepted but he was asked to carry on until other arrangements could be made. He was sent home last October. 1 Much as I dislike to bring up personal matters, I mention this point, as, in my opinion, Mr. Hedgecock’s attitude is biassed. His assertions are a serious slur on my character. * 19. Finally, I deny that Mr. Hedgecock has the slightest justification for inferring that there was a growing extravagance in the administration of a Levy Corps. The expenditure on the Levy decreased each year I commanded it. As far as I can remember the expenditure in 1928 was some Rs. 1,65,000 in 1930 some Rs. 1,35,000. (Sd.) A. R. WALKER, Captain.

(j\ jo a Not enffa^ed in place of my private servant. I had ,aken over a cooly from Cap! Stephens on arrival but as he had been discharged. His post remained unfilled for a long time. It wa refilled eventually on the discharge of another superfluous follower and the budget provision for followers was not exceeded. (8i Umr Dhobi.— Taken over from previous Commandant His dut-es were not very heavy but a further item was also part of his duties. that was to wash the clothing of discharged men before it was returned to store. M,«. Thomas utilised his services on several occasions The dhobi was not retained primarily for my own benefit. ( 3 ) Allowed by Mr. Hedgecock as being correct. ( 10 ) This case has been grossly misrepresented. At one time before mv arrival there were three sweepers. These sweepers had to be granted leave They were often sick with malaria and two were really insufficient Through lack of conservancy staff of this kind (the local sweeper will not touch excreta) a condition of sanitakon obtained which would not have been tolerated in a regular unit. The men had to use a restricted area to the north of the camp. The sweepers were used to attend to the night lines the quarters of the Indian Officers and families, and the married lines of certain other Indian personnel. They had further to attend to men m hospital and to keep all the area near the lines clear of excreta which was often deposited by members of caravans and passers by from the bazar. During roadmaking one of these men attended the construction camp for similar purposes. I consider that five sweepers would have been nearer requirements but, as they had to be obtained from India and were costly and difficult to get they had perforce to be done without. Mr. Hedgecock’s statement that they soent the greater part of their time attending to the Commandants and Indian Officers’ quarters is a gross mis-statement of fact. Ill) Mohammad Abdulla .—Whole paragraph is absolutely inaccurate. There was no boat crew on my arrival. They had been replaced by sepoys by the previous commandant. Mohd. Abdulla looked after the boat which was kept in the sea at Muttrah, two miles from the Levy lines and which was the only means of communication with Muscat. As the road was nearing completion I arranged with Mr. Thomas to give the boat to him as he was badly in need of one for use by H. H. the Sultan. Mohammad Abdulla was a mason by trade and was employed as an expert instructor in the building of walls and ramps on the roads. He was also lesponsible for charging and blowing mines and for cleaning out misfires. TV the very end of my time he was used on road construction and repair. He also looked after my small outboard motor boat as he lived on the beach by the waterside. Mr. Thomas was quite aware of this. The rates of pay of all these followers had been seen and approved by Mr_ Thomas each time a budget was submitted. They were considerably higher than bazar rates as it was difficult to attract them to the Levy at TkwViiw 686 l u W T br c 0ught down considerably in the budget for 1931 but gtill were higher than bazar rates.9 APPENDIX C. Reply to Mr. Hedgecock’s Appendix B. 1. Kerosine oil had always been issued as a ration to all previous commandants. Snowflake oil was imported by me from India for use in pressure lamps. It was issued on payment not only to myself but to the Political Agent, the Agency surgeon andi also to Mr. Hedgecock himself as it could not be obtained locally 2. Flour .—Continued to be issued as a ration instead of atta. Had been so issued for a long time. 3. Petrol .—That used in my boat was obtained privately and paid for by myself except on occasions when I had to use the boat on duty. 4. Commission on money orders. —Owing to the fact that the state could not issue a cheque on an Indian bank, pay of the commandant had to be drawn in hard cash as bad that of the Indian Officers. Commission charged on money orders was allowed by the Finance Minister. Postage was also free but, owing to abuses was curtailed and eventually abolished. 5. I paid for my own dog’s food. This item was for the Irish wolfhound presented to the Levy as a mascot by H. H. the Sultan and not to me. I arranged with the Finance Minister for the State to pay for his keep. The price of his meat was shown on the acquittance roll and his three pounds of atta in the ration return. 6 . Mr. Hedgecock seems to be unaware that there was a men’s fund and an officers’ fund. To the former the men subscribed Re. 1 per annum and all fines levied' went to this fund according to long standing custom. Hockey was maintained by this fund as well and prizes for the annual sports also came from it. The officers’ fund was subscribed to only by the commandant and Indian officers. Any small profits from the soda factory also went to it. Transfers were sometimes made from this fund to the men’s fund but never vice versa. Periodicals were paid for entirely from this fund as were all tennis appliances. The allowance to the Jemadar Adjutant was disallowed by Mr. Hedge cock in the 1931 budget. At the time the Jemadar Adjutant was acting as regimental clerk. By common agreement with all the Indian Officers it was decided to continue his allowance from the officers sports fund until the arrival of a new clerk in appreciation of his services in a time of much stress and worry.

A few facts concerning conditions of service in Muscat showing in accuracies in the circular sent to attract British Officers to the Muskat Levy. 1 Pay of rank plus Rs. m—This was clear as regards the old rates of pay. When I elected the new rates doubt arose which was finally settled, after discussion, by the Finance Minister. In early 1931 when discussing reductions in the Levy pay with the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, he told me that he did not wish any reduction to be made in the Commamdant’s or Indian Officers’ pay. I pointed out to him that difficulties might arise owing to the fact that the circular sent to India did not cover officers under the new rates of pay and that for the benefit of future commandants it should be amended. To this he agreed and asked me to put it up officially. This I did. The Hon’ble the Political Resident was aware that I drew pay at the rate of Rs. 1,255 with the sanction of the Finance Minister. He studied my approved budget for 1930 the first item on which was the pay of the com mandant. 2. Free furnished quarters .—These consisted of a large square house, termed by my Hedgecock a “castle”. Its complete furnishings when I took over consisted of one decent dining table and four chairs. Two Gujerati chairs and a writing desk and chair in good condition. Three large durries much the worse for wear, about half a dozen dilapidated charpoys and a similar collection of broken down chairs of sorts. No crockeryf cutlery, glass-^vare, linen, lamps or cooking pots or any other amenities. A year of hard work improvising furniture out of old bits of wood and packing cases and a lavish expenditure of crettonnes and paint applied by our own hands produced, eventually, a fairly presentable appearance. All expense was borne by myself alone. To describe them as furnished quarters was decidedly inaccurate. 3. Free use of Stale Motor boat .—A 28 foot boat in which had been a powerful engine represented this. The engine had collapsed about 1925 or earlier. This boat was the only means of communication with Muscat unless one used the very dirtv local hooris . At first a crew of four men was kept but they had been replaced by my predecessor by sepoys who were paid a small allowance when they were called upon to row this heavy boat the three miles to Muscat in me blazing sun. A complete misrepresentation of the facts. 4. Free use of State Horse.~A fact. held wntributimsto be paid by the State.—This had been EE. “■* MwfpS E 2 iXrXSXiS JfSJSfS (Sd.) A. R.

Subject:— Captain A. R. Walker, 2j 11th Sikh Regiment. I forward herewith and recommend most strongly for favourable con sideration an appeal from Captain A. R. Walker, 2nd Bn. 11 th Sikh Regi ment against the decision to recover pay overdrawn by him while employed in the Muscat Levy Corps, contained in Army Headquarters letter No. B./ 18331/3 (A.G.- 8 ), dated 18th July 1932. In paragraph 3 of their letter No. D.-2941-N./30, dated the 19th January 1931, the Foreign and Political Department have stated clearly that “in cases where Military Officers are employed on Foreign Service the terms of their pay, leave, etc., are settled individually for each case in consultation with the State concerned”. In view of the above it appears that the responsibility for the correct ness of the pay drawn by such Military Officers rests with either, or both, the Foreign and Political Department and the State concerned, and not with the individual officer. It is obvious that Captain Walker drew his pay in good faith, and with the consent and approval of the Muscat State and the Foreign and Political Department. It is considered therefore that in equity he should not be made to suffer financially for any mistakes made by either the Foreign and Political De portment or the Muscat State, both of whom have the assistance of financial experts to correct such mistakes.10 13 Sub-enclosure 2 in S.

Brigade Area No. 239/ 103/37/H.C., dated 26th July 1932, I beg to request that the following remarks be forwarded to higher authority for sympathetic consideration before any decision regarding recovery of pay is made. 2. At the time of presenting my reply to the allegations made against me by Mr. Hedgecock, Financial Adviser to Muscat State (forwarded under the Commandant’s letter No. 9/5/27/R.C., dated 15th February 1932), I told my Commanding Officer that I was willing to refund any excess pay ment made to me by Muscat State for which His Excellency the Commander- in-Chief might deem me liable. I am in no way going back on this state ment but, since I made it, I have gone further into the question and I there fore respectfully beg to be allowed to bring the following to notice. 2A. In framing my original reply to Mr. Hedgecock s allegations, my time to do so was all too short, as I remained only some ten days with my battalion on return from leave, before proceeding to Nowshera for Reservist Training. I was mainly concerned with answering the allegations which affected my character and I did not go deeply into the question of ruling about my pay and allowances, beyond making efforts to show that they were based on Military Rules. 3. Since my reply under reference was submitted, I have come across a letter from the Deputy Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to the Honourable the I oiitieei Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. D.-2941-N./30. (Copy attached.) This letter seems to me to have a direct bearing on the case It will be observed that in paragraph 3 of this letter that Service with the Muscat Levy Corps is classified as Foreign Service and, in cases where Military Officers are employed on Foreign Service the terms of their pav, leave, etc are settled individually for each case in consultation with the State con- cerned. 4 When I decided that it would be to my benefit to elect the new rates of pay, T wrote to the C. M. A., Quetta, to ask what I would be entitled to under the new rates of pay, the Finance Minister of the State being away ot thp timp The C M A wrote to me and said that he presumed tbit fwould be entitled to pay of Rank, Marriage Allowance I.

L545 c) FA PD l.14 After the return of Mr. Bertram Thomas, the Fitiance Minister to the State, I consulted him about my rates of pay. I told him what the U M-A- had presumed and showed him what I would have been entitled to in India. After discussion, Mr. Thomas agreed to my submitting a consolidated rate of Rs. 1,255 per mensem, which included pay of Rank, Rs. bob* Marriage Allowance Rs. 100, I. A. Allowance Rs. 100, Additional allow- It is necessary to explain that Mr. Thomas was not merely Financial Adviser, but was in addition the actual Finance Minister of the Council of Ministers, which forms the governing body of the State. In my opinion, he was, so far as my pay was concerned, the ultimate authority in^this matter. The Levy Budget for 1929 and ensuing years which included my pay as stated above, was submitted as a sub-head in the Finance Minister’s annual budget and passed each year by the Council of Ministers. ' 5. I was the first officer to elect the new rates of pay. There were no rules extant to guide me and I did the only thing I considered possible by going to the source from which I drew my salary, and I contend that it then rested with the Muscat State to inform the Government of India, a course whiqh I was unaware was necessary. 6. On the occasion of the visit of the Hon’ble the Political Resident (Col. Sir H. V. Biscoe) to Muscat in early 1931, I discussed various problems of the Levy Corps with him. I showed him my budget with my rate of pay and pointed out that the circular sent to India asking for officers for the Muscat Levy Corps was not clear with regard to officers under the new rates of pay, that pay of rank plus Rs. 400 on these rates would not attract officers to an already unpopular service. He expressly stated that he did not want the pay of the Commandant or Indian Officers reduced and asked me to put up the question of the above-mentioned circular officially. This I did. (Vide ffiY Appendix E. of my original answers to Mr. Hedgecock’s allegations.) 1 During the whole period of my service at Muscat, Central Revenues, Delhi, were kept informed of my rate of pay, to enable them to check subscriptions on it, from the Muscat State. 7. I would also point out that the pay sanctioned by Muscat State is rcither less than that allowed to a Wing Commander of the Zhob Militia of about the same seniority. 8. I would therefore respectfully beg to submit that no refund be ordered taking the following points into consideration : {a) did all that I could to get the matter of pay put on a correct basis and to gef a definite ruling for my successor.

As mentioned in paragraph 3 of Part I Captain Walker's acer ge monthly cost of living works out at Rs. 295. It seems unlikely that this figure will be appreciably exceeded on ac count of cheques drawn diiect up on his bankers. Most of the articles imported were paid for on the V -P. P. system and these chargts were passed through his accounts here ; the lists of articles imported by the B. I. steannrs show very few packages for Captain Walker. It may reasonably be assumed that his average living expenses did not exce ed Rs. 350 per mensem The smallness of this figure is in part explained r ^ usca t Treasury met the cost ot the following .-—Kerosene and snowflake oil for household use ; flour for household use , petrol for private launch ; postage stamps and commission on money orders ; khaki shorts ; dogs food ■ periodicals (paid for from Sports Fund) ' etc. No individual item is very large, but the aggr ^te amounts to Rs. 1, /9l. h uller details are given in Appendix B. In some cases (ep., flour, commission on money orders) proof that these iP ms w&gt; re paid f/om Government Funds is furnished by the accounts ; in other cases by oral evidence. It is only fair to Captain Walker to add that Captain Stephens was responsible for originat ing many of the above practices. How far Captain Walker was justifi d in following the doubtful precedents set up by his immediate predecessor is discusser in paragraphs 6—9 of Fart I. 2. Pay of Commandant.—An extract from the Deputy A assistant Controller of Military Ac counts, Peshawar’s No. 1/14/04/PC/26263 of 19th October 1928 to the Political Agent, Muscat, reads as under : — It wan decided under Foreign and Political Departin' nt letter No. D- 1274/A/28, dated 19th May 1928, that the officer in question (Captain A. R. Walker) M ill receive pay of rank, viz., Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400 staff pay while employed Commandant, Muscat Lew Corps. ” J During his first month of command (May 1928) Captain Walker drew his pay at the above rate (namely at Rs. 1,150 p r mensem), his pre decessor drew Rs. 1,160 per mensem. From 1st June 1928 to 30th November 1928 he drew Rs. 1,225 per mensem «nd thereafter Rs. 1.255 per mensem, besides recovering a refund of Rs. 30 per mensem for the peiiod 1st June 1928 to 30th November 1928. authority of the Muscat Council of State or of .&gt;c Foreign and Political Department. .3 This increase in pay can partly be ex- pounc 1 by the fact that Captain Walker elected with effect fi\.m Ft, j uue 1928, to take the new Indian Army rates of pay which were : Pay of Ra ik. I. A. allowance. Marriage allowance. lodging allowance. 655 100 too | 70 In cons- quence of this decision the interpre tation to be put upon clause (I) of his contract— Pay of rank plus Rs. 400 staff pay—becomes open to doubt. It could, for instance, be in terpreted to mean pay of rank only (Rs. 655 &gt;, exclusive of allowances. It could, on the other hand, be interpreted to mean pay of rank (R&lt;. 655) plus all allowances, including (as Captain Walker attempt 'd to include until his claim was njected by the Military Accounts Authorities) lodging allowance, although a free furnished castle is put at the Commandant’s dispose!. In order to settle what he was entitled to draw. Captain Walker enb red into correspond ence with the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta (copies of this correspondence are given in Appendix E). This officer stated :— (а) That if Captain Walker remained on the old rates of pay he would be entitled to Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400, but would not be entitled to the LA. allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem (this being presumably regarded as included in the Rs. 400). (б) That under the revised rates, Captain Walker wuxild be entitled to Rs. 655 pay of rank, Rs. luo L A. Allowance and Rs. 100 marriage allowance, but not lodging allowance ; he expressed a doubt whether, in addition to the revised rates. Captain Walker would be allowed to retain the whole of tb-* Rs. 400. The Indian Army Allowance is granted, I understand, on account of the climate and other disadvantages of living in India. The Muscat allow-ance of Rs. 400 is partly made up of command pay and partly of an allowance for the rigours of the climate. To draw the I. A. Al lowance of Rs. 100 per mensem and the full Rs. 400 per mensem would be to draw, as it were, two allowances for one climate. Captain Walker himself seems to have been douotfu I at first whether he could draw the I. A. Al lowance in addition to the Rs. 400 per mensem, for during his first six he drew Rs. 1,225 made up of pay of rank (655), marriage allowance (100), Muscat allowance (400) and lodging allowance (70)=Rs. 1,225. From the available r&lt; coixL it appear-! that Captain Wall er drew this additional sum of Rs. 105 per mensem without obtaining the But after being informed by the Controller of Military Accounts that he was not entitled to draw the lodging allowance of Rs. 70 pern Appendix D » taehe 1 to Captain Walker s \o. 4 x&gt;f February 1st, 1931, address, d to the Political Agent, Muscat.

The employment of the second L /Naik as a cook is concealed, although the man had acted in this capacity for over 2| years and continued to do so until Captain Walker's departure in the following April. Nor is the above an isol i ted example. During my first six weeks in Muscat I went through the list of followers with Captain Walker time and again, in the hope of reducing their, as it appear ed to me, excessive numbers. 1 was met by evasion, even misrepresentation. I was led to believe that every man was essential for the military e fieiency, morale, prestige or esprit de corps of the force. Never once was there any admission that one or moie of these followers was a whole-time personal servant of Captain Walker. 7. (a) In retaining these category (6) men as liis servants, Captain Walker seems not only to nave acted in bad faith but contrary aho to his instructions. In 1928 he was asked by the Government of Muscat to reduce to the utmost expenditure on the Levy. In submitting his NT Ud fi ! ? 29 Ca P tain Walk « states (his -No. 269 of 20th December 1928), “The question of economy has been seriously gone into and I submit the present budget as the irreducible minimum . As far as the followers were concerned (exclud ing syces and camel men), this irreducible mini- mum was reached by discharging 3 jaroowalaa and engaging two punkhawallahs (used as private servants), a net decrease of 1 follower. (i.) In January 1931, in answer to my nleas for retrenchment, Captain Walker stated in hie No. 3 of 23rd January 1931 : 18 (1) The Levy is down to absolute bedrock in economies. 2 * (2) The Le/y cannot make further sacrifices if it is to remain worthy of the name. At the time these statements were mad budget requirements for 1931 were Rs. in excess of the previous year's expenditure and the Government employees in his service numbered 12. (c) On February 16tb, 1931, the Hon’bie the Political Residue informed Captain Walker that, owing to the financial position of the State of Muscat, the budg t of Rs. 1,54,000 which he had previously smetioned was to be dropped, and that in its place Captain Wilke'’ was to submit a budget showing a saving of approximately Rs. 11,000 on the previous year’s expenditure. In this budget the only saciifice among his person il retain ns Captain Walker was prep ired to make on behalf of the bankrupt Government which paid him was to discharge his third punkha coolie on Rs. 10 p.m and slightly to reduce the pay of the remainder. 8. During Mr. Thomas’ leave in England, Captain Walker officiated for 8 months as Finan cial Adviser, drawing an extra duty allowance of Rs. 300 p.m. With his intimate knowledge of the interior economy of the Levy, Captain Walker was in a far better position than Mr. Thomas to reduce the amount the State was spending on many minor extravagances not to be found in the Indian Army. He failed, how ever, to take any such action. 9. It will be observed from the preceding paragraphs that: (а) Though Captain Walker felt so doubtful of the validity of the precedent which he was fol owing that he was obliged to resort to evasion and con cealment, he did not ask for a ruling from higher authority in the matter of his personal retainers, (б) By neglecting to carry out his instruc tions to elf jet rigid economies in the Levy, Captain Walker failed in his duties as Commandant. (c) By allowing the continuance of unjusti fiable expenditure in the Levy force, Captain Walker failed in his duty as officiating Financial Adviser. In the mat of the above it would seem that Captain Walkers retention of the Government employees used as personal servants bv bis predecessor cannot be j ustified. n x nee iaroo\ Captain Walker is liable to refund the co the other men used by him as personal retail Tnis sum amounts to Rs. 7,657.

Enough has b-cn said to show that the ate of pay aptam Walker was entitled to draw was open to doubt. In the cinumstances his course of action was char: he should have referred this matter of his own pav to higher authority—particularly in view of the Military Controller s doubts a. to whether he would be entitled to retain the full Rs. 400, in addition to the revised rates. Actually Captain Walker fixed his own rate of pay at Rs. 105 per men- sem higher than the figure he had been en gaged at, without any reference to the Foreign and Pol tical Department or to the Muscat Council of State.

To my objection that a leave passage for his wife was imgular, Captain Walker replied that bis predecessor had charged to the State not only sea passages from Muscat to Karachi for lus wife and three children, but also their train tares from Karachi to Kotdwara. A search through the accounts confirms Captain Walker’s statement, but shows that the passages referred to above were taken in May 1928, i.e., the month in which Captain Stephens rejoined his unit. A passage of this nature can hardly be quoted as a precedent for Mrs. Walker’s two leave passages. Mrs. Stephens took a State-paid passage from Muscat to Karachi in 1927, but as Captain alker did not quote this as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact. In any case Captain Stephens may have had special authority for this passage (he was very popular with the Sultan). On his own admission, Captain Walker has no such authority. On the whole it would appear that no reliable precedent exists for Captain Walker’s action in taking leave passages for his wife and servant. 7 7 - T* 16 last point to consider is whether the measure of control exercised by the Ministry of P inance over the financial administration of the Muscat Infantry in anv way extenuates Captain Walker’s actions. „, F ' t . h ® la . s ? « iz yea« (and probably longer) no audit objections have been raised' against the accounts of the Muscat Infantry. This means that the Commandant has 1 had almost free ban 1m the financial administration of ns force. Such a position carries with it both greater advantages and greater responsibilities : the Commandant must be more not less care ful of the expenditure of public monies. In other words the auditing of the Levy accounts is left to the Commandant. Under such a system the Ministry of Finance must perhaps antici- pate and tolerate a growing extravagance m the administration of the force, but with a British officer in command it can reasonably expect that any such extravagances will not include large unauthorised payments on the Commandant s personal behalf. If guc h pay ments are made they can only be justified if based upon an undoubted precedent : if the slightest doubt exists the recognized practice among Government servants is not personally t beneht from public money without the prior sanction of higher authority. In Captain Walker’s case, there were obvious instances (e.g., his pay) where he should have sought the rulings of higher authority, and Ovhers where he elected to follow doubtful precedents—a course which led him to evasion and misrepresentation. For his own acts it would seem that Captain Walker and no other person, should be held responsible. 8. Should the Council of State decide, with the concurrence of the Government of India to claim from Captain Walker a refund of the monies wrongfully charged to the State, the following sums would appear to be due from him :— Personal servants Miscellaneous Privileges Excess pay I.

Remarks : —Previous to 19?7 no dhobi wa s shown in the strength of the Levy J since Captain Walker’s departure the dhobi has been discharged and the Levy is carrying on quite well without him. The dhobi’s official duties were — (а) to shrink khaki drill to be made up by the tailor into uniforms. A tub has now been brought for the tailor who does his own shrinking. ( б ) to wash the clothing of discharged or sick men. According to Subedar Major, many months go by without any washing under this bead. Such washing can b a , and is now being done locally at Matrah at an average cost of less than Rs. 3 p.m. In addition to his official duties the dhobi washed the clothes of Captain Walker, and the 3 I. Os. who each paid him Re. 1 p.m. In view of the above it seems clear that the dhobi was retained primarily for Captain Walker’s ben fit. His cost less the Rs. 3 p.m. mentioned above thus seems a fair charge against Captain Walker. Amount recoverable :—Rs. 1,081. j(ix) Name, Abdul Rehman, official designa tion, Jharoowala.

Period em ployed, 35 months. Remarks :—Prior to 1927 only one sweeper was employed. Since Captain Walker’s departure the two Indian sweepers on Rs. 30 p.m. and rations Lave been discharged and a local man on Es. 15 p.m. net engaged in their place. I was led by Captain Walker to believe that ’hese two sweepers were essential for the Levy force. My suggestion that an e.conomy would be effected if the s poys used a tremh, which would be gradually filled in by earth, was rejected as being highly unsuitable for a standing camp. '1 he existing arrangement, the Subedar- Major now informs me, is for the sepoys to have the unrestricted use outside the lines of the des rt for depositing their excreta. The only official duties performed bj' the two sweepers is to remove the night bucket and to attend to sick men in the lines. For this purpose one sweeper would be, and used to be, ample. The two sweepers on the strength spent the greater part of their time in attending the quarters of the Commandant and the 3 I. Os. I consider that the retention of the second sweeper was primarily for the con venience of Captain Walker and that he is liable to meet his pay. Amount recoverable Rs. 1,182.

Allowance paid by Captain Walker, Nil. Period employed, 1st September 1929 to 31st April 1931. Remarks to August 1929 the Levy maintained a boat with crew of four for communication with Muscat. On the lorry being purchased the boat was given up and the crew dismissed, except for Mahomed Abdulla. He was retained and put in charge of Captain Walker’s private launch, wiiich also arrived about this time. Though it is claimed that this man was at times employed on the road, I consider that he would almost certainly have been discharged with the rest of the crew had not Captain Walker purchased his private launch. In the circumstances, I considtr this man’s pay is a proper charge against Captain Walker. Amount recoverable Rs. 690.

Reference your demi-official dated 18th September 1928, to Colonel Wylde. As the full term of your appointment are not known in this office I camiot say definitely what rates of pay you will be entitled to. However the follwing information may help you :— (a) If you remain on the old rates of pay you will probably be entitled to pay of rank Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400. The Indian Army allowance of Rs. 100 will not be admissible in addition. (b) If you elect the revised rates of pay you will draw Rs. 655 pay of rank, Rs. 100 I. A. allowance Rs. 100 marriage allowance ; presumably lodging allowance will not be admissible because you have been provided with free quarters. It is not known what portion of Rs. 400 will be allowed to you in addition to the revis ed rates. As you will be in the payment and audit area of the A. G. C. R., Delhi, I suggest you ask that officer. If you think we can help you further please do not hesitate to write again. From Captain A R. Walker, to Controller of Military Accounts, No. 228 of 1928, dated the 24th October 1928. Reference your No. OI51j3840 of 1st October 1928. I am very much obliged to you for your assist ance regarding my rates of pay. uj. correspondence with Ac countant General, Central Revenues, Delhi, are very slow I am forwarding you a copy of the terms of agreement with the Muscat State for your opinions thereon. As regards paragraph 3, I presume that I will T/lS f ° r ? uarters and wil] d^aw the allowance. Should there be any question raised by Muscat state I will m future write direct to A. G. C R L&gt;elhi. With many thanks for your assistance. From the Controller of Military Accounts,. Quetta, to Captain A. R. Walker, Muscat, No. 0/51/4516, dated 9th November 1928. Reference your No. 228 of 1928. From item (1) of the term of your agreement with the Muscat State copy of which has been received with your memo, under reference it appears that you will be entitled to pay of rank at the old rates, viz., Rs. 750 plus Rs. 400 p.m. staff pay. With these rates you will not be required to pay rent for the quarters occupied by you. 2. Should you elect to draw the new rates of pay I should say that you will not be entitled to lodging allowance because in the revised scale this item is separate from pay proper (of rank) and is to be drawn only when free quarters cannot be provided, i.e., I interpret your agreement as continuing to you your ordinary rights (as regards quarters) of an I. A. officer. But this is a question for A. G. C. R. to decide. Footnote by Captain A. R. Walker to head clerk, Muscat Levy. Barkatullah.

W Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 521-S., dated the 21st August 1931. has no such authority. On the whole it would appear that no reliable precedent exists for Captain Walker’s action in taking leave passages for his wife and servant.” In continuation of my demi-official letter JNo. 429-S, of 17th July 1931 I attach herewith ^copies of the following telegraphic correspondence which has taken place between Alban and -tnyself:— '&lt;!) Telegram No. 174 of 1st August 1931, from the Political Agent, Muscat; '(2) Telegram No. 447 of 2nd August 1931, from myself to the Political Agent, Muscat. 2. My demi-official letter to Eedgcock men* tioned in my telegram No. 447 to the Poli* tical Agent, Muscat, was attached to my letter quoted above, but I give the relevant extract here fox ready reference. '“4. With regard to (1), however, it seems necessary to confirm the fact that ♦Captain Stephens took a passage for his wife,^ since you point out in your letter D , paragraph 2, that this depends on Walker’s statement alone. Also the copies of the entries in the Muscat Treasury Accounts with regard to pass ages might be produced as a matter of form. If you are going to Muscat you could enquire into the first, and produce the second. Otherwise your Accountant General could take the necessary action. Result of your—-or your Accountant General s—action should be communi cated to me.” 3. Hedgcock’s reply to this demi-official letter, 'Which he sent from Muscat is as follows : Part HI,—Leave Passages. J&lt; In Appendix C will be found certified true extracts from the Levy Accounts giving details of the two leave passages taken ,by Mrs. Walker. Such leave passages ere not included in Captain Walker’s contract—a copy of which is given in Appendix D. To my objection that a leave passage for his wife was irregular, Captain Walker iPephed that his predecessor had charged to the State not only sea passages from Muscat to Karachi for his wife and three ( children, but also their train fares from Karachi to Kotdwara. A search through the accounts confirms Captain Walker’s statement, but shoFS that the passages referred to above were taken in May 192$, i.e., the mopth in which Captain Stephens qejoined his unit. A passage .of this r ture can hardly be quoted as a precedent for Mrs. Walker’s two leave passages. Mrs. Stephens took a State-paid passage from Muscat • to Karachi in 1927, but as Captain Walker did not quote this as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact. In any case Captain Stephens may have had special authority for this passage. On his own admission, Captain Walker . aacuxuuuk., con tains certified true extracts from Levy Accounts and is formal evidence that leave passages were actually taken for Mrs. Walker. 5. With regard to the precedent formed by Captain Stephens, please see paragraphs 11 and 13 of my letter quoted above. According to edgcock s statement, such passages were taken by that officer once when rejoining ms unit and once when going on recess. Hedg- cock states that as Walker did not quote this latter incident as a precedent, he was presumably ignorant of the fact. As, however, whatever case Walker did quote he quoted verbally and not by the book, it is not clear to which case he refers, and there was certainly a precedent for his action! My opinion, therefore on this charge is the same as already expressed in paragraph 13 of my letter quoted above. ™ 6 i, There were 4 ori « inaI charges against Captain Walker paragraph 8 of my letter quoted above— (1) Unauthorised Passages; (2) Fines put into Sports Fund ; (3) Employment as private servants of indi viduals paid by the State ; and (4) Unauthorised dog rations. ^ • All the material on these four charges is now with you. (1), (2) and (4) are dealt with in my letter quoted above and in paragraph 5 of this letter, while Alban’s demi-official letter No. C.-175 of 7th August 1931 with enclosures, finishes (3). 8. With reference to the further charges referred to in Alban’s telegram No. 174 of 1st August 1931 and in enclosures to Alban’s demi-offiicial letter No. C.-175 of 7th August 1931 to Wylie (Hedgcock s report, paragraph 10). I am still of opinion, as stated in paragraph 6 of my letter D, 0. No. 435-S. of 18th July 1931 to Hedgcock attached to my D. 0. letter No. 447-S., dated the 20th July 1931 that he had plenty of time to prepare all his evidence against Walker before he left Muscat, and this piece-meal way of conducting his case is most unsatisfactory. However, as he has put forward this evidence backed by Alban I am forwarding it to you under a separate letter. In any case these further charg es do not necessitate Hedgcock’s continuance at Muscat, as, if it is decided that investigation into them is necessary, the material is there and Alban can carry out the necessary work. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to Colonel Biscoe and to Alban. Telegram R., from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Political Resident, Bushire, No. 174, dated the 1st August 1931.

In continuation of my demi-official letter iNo. 521-S. of 21st August 1931, paragraph 8 I forward herewith a copy of the new charges which Hedgcock has brought against Walker, with Appendices B, D and E, and some general remarks by Hedgcock on the question of the control exercised by the Ministry of Finance over the financial administration of the Muscat Infantry and an estimate of the total claim by the State against Walker. 2. The new charges can be divided into three categories :— (a) That Walker drew a higher rate of pay from the State than he should have; (b) That he charged the State with his con tributions on account of the Indian Military Widows and Orphans’ fund; (c) That he charged the State with various miscellaneous items, which he used for private consumption. 3. With reference to (a). —By his contract Walker was entitled as Commandant of the Muscat Levy to “ Pay of Rank plus Rs. 400 Staff pay At the time he took up the appoint ment of Commandant he was on the old rate of pay Rs. 750, which with Rs. 400 gave him Rs. 1,150 per mensem. On the 1st June 1928 he elected to come on the new rates :— 4 5 6 Pay of Indian Army Marriage Lodging Rank. Allowance. Allowance. Allowance. Rs. Rs. Rs. RS. 655 100 100 70-925 4. His contract reads : Pay of Rank plus Rs. 400, which—by strict interpretation—on the new rates would have given him Rs. 650 + Rs. 400—Rs. 1,050, but this would have been Rs. 100 less than the State was paying him before, and it is obyious that whatever the changes made in his Indian Army pay, etc., the State should not pay him less than what he contracted for, i.e. } Rs. 1,150. 5. Walker applied to the Controller of Military Accounts, Quetta, for a ruling as to how much he should draw on the new rates. The Controller of Military Accounts replied (Appendix E) that—- in his opinion—'Walker would be entitled to draw pay of rank plus Indian Army allowance and Marriage allowances, but not Lodging allowance as free quarters were provided. The Controller of Military Accounts added he did not know what portion of the Rs. 400 Staff pay would be allowed, and that the Accountant-General, Central Re venues, was the proper authority to decide this question. 6. From 1st June 1928 up to the date on which he relinquished his post of Commandant, ac cording to Hedgcock’s statement (paragraph 3), Walker drew for the first six months : Pay of Rank (Rs. 655), Military allowance (Rs. 100), Lodging allowance (Rs. 70) and Staff pay (Rs. 400) “R®. 1,225. Then, after being informed by the Controller of Military Accounts that he was not entitled to Lodging allowance Walker, according to Hedgcock, dropped the Lodging allowance of Rs. 70 and substituted the Indian Army one of Rs. 100, thus drawing Rs. 1,255. It may be pointed out that Walker had the opinion of the Controller of Military Accounts that he could draw the Indian Army allowance (paragraph 4 above). 7. What rate of pay Walker should have drawn over the period in question, i.e., from 1st June 1928 to April 1931 when he gave up his command is really a matter on which the opinion of an Accounts Officer is required. I can only make the following comments. On the one hand it may be argued that Walker having been engaged on a contract of Rs. 1,150 should not draw more from the State—no change in his rank having taken place—during his period of service. On the other hand, however, should he be debarred from the benefit of an increase of pay and allowances given him by the Indian Government while he was in State service, even though the payment of this addition meant naturally more expense to the State ? Supposing Walker had been in the service of an Indian State, in Imperial Service Troops for instance, and had elected to come on the new Indian Army rates, what pay and allowances would he have been allowed to draw in addition to his Staff pay ? I think the question might be decided on these lines, for which there must be precedent and rulings. 8. With regard to (b ).—I can only suggest that Walker be asked for an explanation. 9. With regard to (c).—These charges should be cleared up, in my opinion, and Alban could carry out the necessary investigation. He has already in a demi-official letter to me, stated “ Part 11 (of Hedgcock’s report) deals with miscellaneous items charged to the State by Captain Walker, the correctness of each one of these is supported either by an entry in Captain Walker’s private account, in the monthly lists of expenditure submitted by the Levy Corps or by the statement of the Subedar Major. The entries have been shown to me by Mr. Hedgcock and there is no doubt that Captain Walker did enjoy free kerosine oil and the best quality of flour for his own private use. Postage stamps and commission on money orders were paid for by the State, had he wished to have his pay remitted to India he could have had cheques on Bombay from the Muscat State Treasury, this would not have cost either Captain Walker or the State anything ”. But I do not think this opinion can take the place of a detailed investigation. This would not entail Hedgcock staying on at Muscat, as all the proof, etc,, is there in documentary form.

PI ate refer to demi-official letter No. 429-S., dat. &lt;1 th 17th July 1931, from Major Fowle to Mr. Howell, paragraph 7. T forward herewith Hedgcock’s report regarding the employment by Captain Walker of State paid individuals as his personal servants. 2. You will see in Appendix “ A ”, para. II that a list of 12 servants, paid by the State, has been drawn up. Out of these 12, however, Hedgcoek has allowed 1 orderly, 1 Jaroowala and 1 Bhisti as being a legitimate charge on the State, the wages of 1 Punkhawaia, at the current rate of Rs. 7 for 6 months has also been deducted from the total of wages paid to Punkha coolie No. V over three years. 3. The servants required by an Englishman (bachelor) in Muscat are :— 1. Cook. 2. Table servant or bearer. 3. Masaichi. 4. Punkha coolie (6 months). 5. Dhobi. 6. Sweeper. 7 Jaroowala. 8. Bhisti. i According to Mr. Hedgcoek, however, Captain Walker only had one private servant, who was dispensed with last year (para. 4 of Hedgcock’s report). It must be clear therefore that Captain Walker did actually have the above servants, and, as he had none of his own, they must have been drawn from the Levy Corps. In addition to the above, there is shown a boat man, who attendea to Captain Walker’s private boat, an orderly, an extra, Punkha coolie and an extra Jaroowala. 4 4. Para. 4 of the report states that the average monthly sum out of a salary of Rs. 1,255 per mensem remitt3d by Captain Walker to his bank, over a period of 6 months was Rs. 950. As a bachelor and living under very temporary conditions here, my expenses were Rs. 600 for June and Rs. 400 for July, this month, August. I expect to cost me Rs. 500 owing to several visits by the Navy and Air Force. It is therefore difficult to suppose that Captain and Mrs. Walker, who from ail accounts enter tained in some style, could have existed on under Rs. 300 per month. 5. Mr, Hedgcock has produced Captain Walker’s private account book before me and it shows clearly the number of servants employed, their names and the extra allowances paid them by Captain Walker. The same men are shown on the AcquiLttnce Rolls of the Levy Corps as Government personnel in receipt of pay and rations. There is no doubt that Captain Walker did em ploy the number of servants shown and that they we.e at the same time paid and rationed by the State. 1 think that Hedgcock is right in allowing him 1 orderly and the services of a Bhisti free, ttie allowance of 1 Punkha Coolie for the office (Appendix “A ”, para. 5) and 1 Jaroowala for cleaning the empty wing (para. 9) is also in order. The rest of the servants, 9 in number, as shown in para. II of Appendix “ A ”, ought never to have been a charge on the State and the amount which the State has had to pay on this account can legitimately be claimed as a refund from Captain Walker. It is interesting to note that the total sum claimed, i.e., Rs. 7,657, over a period of 3 years works out to approximately Rs. 200 a mouth which is just what a married couple in the Army, living anywhere, would pay for servants. The gravest charge against Captain Walker is that when repeatedly asked to effect all possible economies in followers etc., to help the State out of a financial crisis he deliberately stated that he was down to rockbottom and could not dispense with any more, this while himself employing 12 of them for his own personal service. 6. I suggest that the Financial Adviser should first approach Captain Walker privately with a view to making him refund the above sum. If this fails the matter can be taken up officially. It may be noted that the accuracy of figures quoted iu Aopendix “ A ' is vouched for by the Accountant-General, Muscat State.

Captain Walker’s private f c ? uat coVe [ 4 * * * 8 the period 1st July 1930-23rd April 1931. It gives the names of the Government employees used by him as personal servants and the month ly allowance paid to each. Also »t shows for the six-month period 1st August 1930—31st January 1931 that on a pay of Rs. 1,25 d p.m. Captain Walker was able to remit to Lloyds Bank, Karachi, an average sum of Rs. 950 p.m, and that his average monthly living expenses during this period were Ra. 295. As Captain and Mrs. Walker’s style of living (their hosm- tality was a byword throughout the Gu! ) could not possibly be maintained on this figure, even allowing for the small sum spent on servants as shown below, enquiries were made to see if Captain Walker enjoyed any other privileges at the expense of the State. I no result of these enquiries is given in Part II of this report. The above mentioned account shows that during the period 1st August 1930—28th Febru ary 1931 Captain Walker— (a) kept only one private servant, namely, a gardener’s boy on Rs. 6 p.m. (engag ed in October 1930), (b) paid small allowances to 8 Government employees, the majority of whom were whole-time personal servants. Further enquiries showed that an additional 4 men (the majority part-time) were used by Captain Walker as personal servants, but received no allowances. One of these began to receive an allowance on 1st March 1931. This retinue of 13 personal retainers cost Captain Walker Rs. 60 p.m. All these men were discharged or returned to the ranks shortly after Captain Walker’s depar ture, thus showing that their employment was not necessary for the Levy Corps itself. 4. I next questioned the Subedar Major with a view to confirming the particulars given the preceding paragraph. He said that on taking up his command Captain Walker brought with him one personal servant, but on returning from leave in 1930, he did not bring this man back ; in bis place he engaged an extra follower. (This man was paid from Government funds though no budget provision existed.) 5. During recent years the number of men employed in the Muscat Infantry as the Com- mandant’s personal servants appears gradually to have increased. One Commandant takes over the men employed by his predecessor and adds to the number; his successor takes over the increased number and in his turn adds U them. The extent to which Captain Waiker g staff of servants is justified by precedent thus requires careful examination. The sepoys and followers in Captain Walker’s employ can be divided into three categories : (a) Those whose employment has the san « tion of an unquestioned precedi nt. For example, every officer in the British and Indian Armies has the use of an orderly or soldier servant. Though Captain Walker’s contract does not specify the use of a free orderly, it would be unreasonable, in the face of so well-established a precedent, to withuold this customaiy privilege. (b) Those already employed by Captain Walker’s predecessor. (c) Those taken on as personal s rvants by Captain Walker himself, e., those for whose employment no precedent exists. In Captain Walker’s case these are : 1928 2 punkha coolies. 1929 1 boatman for private launch. 1930 a third punkha coolie. The term punkha codie is a misnomer. In Muscat a punkha coolie can be obtained for Rs. 7 p.m. and is normally engaged for six months in the year. Capt in Walker’s punkha coolies were in reality household servants and were engaged for 12 mouths in the year, 2 being paid at Rs. 15 p.m. phrs rations, and one at Rs. 10 p.m. plus rations. Categories (a) and (c) need no further discus r sion. Under (a) the precedent is accepted ; unde (c) no prec dent exists. C itegory (6) comprising 6 or 7 servants, requires fuller examination, 6. The first question to determine is whether Captain Walker, in following his predecessor's precedent, acted in good faith or not. In matters of this nature there exists another and far more fir July established precedent to the effect that Government servants, if benefiting personally fiom any precedent, should refer the question to higher authority in the event of there being any element of doubt as to its validity. Captain Walker does not appear to have followed this last precedent. His failure to do so is an indi cation that he was acting in bad faith, or else was supremely confident that he was entitled to so large a number of personal servants. But his subsequent actions beiie this confidence. Captain Walker’s retinue of servants included two L /Naiks one his personal Orderly and the noinift C °k / A t man actin S in g° od f aith has nothing to hide; if acting in bad faith he has resort to concealment and subterfuge. This attitude ia reflected in both its aspects in</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000143_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/49</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000143</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/49</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 1648/32 Persian Gulf: Irregularities Committed by Captain A R Walker as Commandant of Muscat State Levy Corps</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1933</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-07T17:48:49</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (20 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate reverse chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 20; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence (mainly copies) regarding irregularities in connection with the administration and command of the Muscat State Levy Corps by Captain A R Walker, 11th Sikh Regiment.It includes:copies of correspondence between S E Hedgcock, Muscat, and the Political Agent, Muscatcopies of demi-official letters from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent, Muscatcopies of correspondence between the Political Agent, Muscat, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulfcopy of memorandum from the Adjutant General in India, Army Headquarters, Delhi, to the Headquarters, Western Command, Quetta, and enclosurescopy of memorandum from the General Officer, Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, to the Adjutant General in India, with enclosures including a memorandum from Captain Walker to the Adjutant, 2nd Battalion, 11th Sikh Regiment, answering allegations made against him by S E Hedgcock</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Army, Western Command</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Army, Adjutant General</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Allegations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fraud</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000143#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
