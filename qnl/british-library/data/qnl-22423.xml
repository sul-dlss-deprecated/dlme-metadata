LIy dear Sir Geoffrey, v Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/143 dated the 16th August 1944 enclosing a report which I have reau with much interest and am now returning to you. 2. The position of Eamaran is an interesting one for although it is 'ruled 1 ' by a British administrator it is in fact not British territory as no decision was arrived at with regard to whom it should be granted at the time of the signature of the Treaty of Versailles. As far as I recollect,at the time of the transfer of Aden.to the Colonial Office it was decided that as it could not be considered a part of the Colony or Protectorate, and as it was financed solely by the quarantine Ctation budget which derived its income from fees from pilgrims from India and the Dutch East Indies, it would be more proper for the ultimate financial control to remain with India while for convenience 1 sake the administration was supervised by the Governor of Aden. The administration does extend to matters other than the pilgrimage but only internal affairs as described in the report. In fact we own the place though in theory we do not, and in fact we run the place In col laboration with our Butch friends and exclude other nations though we found it impossible to resist an Italian medical infiltration immediately prior to the outbreak of this war. 4. As far as I know the Ghaikh has shown no inclination to vary his diet but provided I can acquire a correct vocabulary I will explain the dietic peculiarities of the Sudanese. 6. I am afraid there is no fishing in Bahrain which could be improved. The South coast of Persian Baluchistan and the Batinah Coast of Muscat should prove very fruitful fields for anyone interested in encouraging the fish canning and fish meal trades. m,. r* _ lours sincerely, The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., ^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Shiraz.MIDDLE EAST SUPPLY CENTRE, Ref: AP 10500/ABA/3 10 ’ SHARIA toluhbat.

SUMMAEY OP CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. | i A preliminary target for the production of fresh fish at Abadan for the feeding of* AIOG Staff and Labour may be set ^ at 3000 tons per year* At present about 800 tons per year is available in a collection scheme from the local fishermen* This scheme can probably be enlarged to some extent but the^ target cannot be approached without the aid of more productive modern methods. Trawling has been suggested and would pro bably be effective* Renewed exertions arc needed to provide one (or two) trawlers or long-distance collecting vessels of 90—100 ft length with refrigerating machinery* As cifHsagcd by AIOO, such a vessel might be built at Kuweit* At Trie same time it is recommended that further negotiations bo started in U. In any event it will probably be not less than a year before such a vessel is at work, and meanwhile the gap, be tween present production and the target, it is suggested, should he filled by the import of dried fish from the Gulf of Oman. The requirements of vitamins &amp; D it is suggested possibly might bo mot, by the use of sardine oil which is f available from the fisheries of the Arabian coasts# IIITRODUCTIOIV A recent special investigation by Dr# Mcilclejohn, of the Roclcfoiler Foundation, has • shown that tho diet at present available to the Anglo-I rani an Oil Co T s labour at Abadan is deficient in animal pretein and vitamin A, vegetables and vitamin C, and perhaps also vitamin D. Dr* Moilclejohn T s con clusions were based on comprehensive evidence embracing clini cal tests, foods available and so on# Tho provision of ade quate quantities of fish from the Persian Gulf at once presen ted itself as an obvious method of meeting the protein defi ciency and, perhaps too, the shortage of vitamins A &amp; D# M*E*S#C* therefore directed me to investigate the fishery pro blem. My travels in connection with tho problem extended from ?th July when I arrived at Abadan to 4th August when I v , left Teheran, and included visits to Kuweit and Bahrein* I an most grateful to all those at Abadan, Kuweit, Bahrein and Teheran who were so kind in providing*me with in formation and hospitality, thus making my tour of groat interest and, I hope, ensuring its worth# Those with whom conversations were held on various aspects of the general problem are listed in Rote I# In order to see the main problems in reasonable propor tions it is helpful to have a good deal of the background /T' information easily available# So far as possible this is relegated to a series of notes at the end of this Report, and reference is made by number in the text. Thus it is hoped that this Report may be of interest to more than those directly concerned with tho solution of the central problems. Brief, written, Interim Reports were given to AIOC on 18th and 23rd July and discussed in detail., The conclusions and recommendations there set out are incoirporatod and expanded in this present final Report, but arc not modified in substance, though perhaps a little in relative stress as the evidence gradually became available* 0* General/* * *. • ♦V - 2 ~ 0. GEKSRMi, Dr* Meiklejohn*s conclusion that the large AIOG Labour force lias an imperfect diet is indisputable# Wliether its im perfection is much greater than is common among Middle Eastern people in peace time is more doubtfull# Some would even say that the AIOC Labour is now better fed in war tine that it was previously in peace, with however some important exceptions* Se that as it may* the present and future work of the AIOC, in ofling the Par East war f is of such paramount importance tha1$ no risk is justified* Great efforts to improve the diet^of the labour forco would still seem worthy even if the result is a considerably higher nutritional level than the. average for the Middle East. The extraordinarily trying climate of Abadan and the long hours of hard work also have to be borne in mind when considering the diet of AIOC Labour in relation to food availabilities in nearby territories. A further point of importance is that to the majority of the AIOC labour force the surroundings and climate of Abadan are almost as foreign as to a European, Senior Iranian or Indian member of the Staff. Most of the labourers cone, it is stated, from the hill country Persia whore meat and vegetables arc freely available and where the climate is loss extreme* It is to be noted that the labourers by upbringing arc meat, and not fish, eaters. In peace time moderate quanti ties of meat were available to them, but these have diminished absolutely and relatively during the war at the same tine as the labour force has grown. This explains to a large extent what might have been the expected prewar natural adjustment between local fish catching and the new centre of population at Abadan which has been expanding for over 30 years. The population of Abadan, some 33 roiles from the open water of tho Gulf, lias continued to look landward for its food and well being. All tho other older and smaller population centres on the shores of the Persian Gulf derive their food and prosperity mainly from maritime sources, for example Kuweit, Bahrein, Muscat etc. Tho AIOC has now, under the pressure of war, become highly conscious of this maladjustment between the protein- poverty of the diet of the labour force and the abundance of fish^ (but not of fishermen), in the nearby waters of the Persian Gulf, Some successful steps have already been taken to meet tho need by regular collections from local fisherman. The desire is strong to go far further# Tills necessitates the Company itself entering tho fishery with modern vessles and productive methods of catching, for .. example by trawling# Such enterprise tlw Company appears willing to embark upon at the present time, though really of a long term nature# There seem however to be differences of opinion as to tho post war policy of the Company over the feeding of its many thousands of labourers# 'Fhc primary aim of the AIOC being oil production there is a desire, in seme minds, to leave such matters as the feeding of workers after the war, to the normal traders of Persia* others feel that this may never be entirely satisfactory and that tho food pro gramme on which the Company has been forced to embark under the stress of war, will have to be continued into the peace# This is/# ,, “ | --3- is an over-simplification of the argument. But it needs to 130 stressed that new fishery enterprise on the part of the Company is unlihely to show real results in less than a year and ohat such enterprise cannot easily ho divorced from a post v/ar policy of ensuring an adequate diet for the-labour force.

The Oompa- fish is collected brought up to Abadai Id storage. The/.The fiGh collected in this scheme varies in species and in amount from month to month, the winter being a season of re lative scarcity* The fish is divided into three categories by species, the third quality in European estimation being sold at fixed rates to the labourers, while the first two grades arc reserved for Staff. Of the total weight of fish caught the 4000 odd Staff and families at present receive about half and the 100,000 labourers (again including resident dependents) receive the other half. Worked out extremely roughly on an average monthly basis, and smoothing out seasonal fluctuations, it may be said that the present collection and distribution scheme provides the Staff with about a dozen pounds of..'whole fresh fish per head per month and the Abadan labour force with about 1 lb of whole fresh fish per head per month*. The Staff it is stated could well do with rather more fresh ; fish c.t most seasons of the year, while the clamour in the municipal market at the time of distribution is a sure indica tion of the desire for more cheap fish on tho part of the Labour being very far from satisfied# Further details will be found in Notes II,III, and IV# k* Dried Fish . Certain quantities of native-type salted, dried Yish arc~regularly on sale in the Abadan bazaar. This is imported by dhow, by native contractors, from the southern end of the Persian Gulf and tho Gulf of Oman# (see -Note V). Dried prawns arc also imported from Bundar Abbas and elsewhere. Whether or not this dried fish in fact is providing a signifi cant part of the animal protein available to the native labour is unknown, but perhaps will become apparent when Dr. Meikleoohn’s full Report is received# This dried fish is certainly appre ciated by the people but tho impression was gained that it is too expensive at present for them to buy as much as they, would like. F. FISHERY DEVELOPMENTS . It is evident that there is a great gap between the pre liminary target of 3000 tons of fresh fish per year to be landed at Abadan and the present availibility, namely 800 tons per year of fresh fish plus an undetermined, but moderate, quantity of dried fish. To fill the gap and reach, this initial and rather humble target, will require great exertion and a good deal of time, probably r^ot less than a year# Tho methods by which the gap may be filled are set out below* &amp; a# Import of dried fish . Because of the inevitable and considorablo jfci'mc 'lag which will occur before the fresh fish available at Abadan car. be largely increased, it is recommended that at once quantities of dried fish should be imported and made available to the labour force at prices which they can easily afford. Such bulk import by AIOC should be quite easily arranged# Tho dried fish, it is suggested, could be brought up to Abadan in the Company^ own small vessels which deliver cased petrol to such plaoes as Sharja, Bundar Abbas, Muscat and Masira Island and Salala# These plaoes are centres, of popula tion in tho main fishing regions, from which dried fish is nor mally exported in the Indian Ocean dhow traffic.1 should he siven fop him to-corry out v/hatever initial experi mental fishery work may he possible using the collecting launches available (See Notes IV and VllJ. It would he well for him to study arable. The careful recording, of the results of experiments and of all fishing grounds, must he insisted upon (See Note Vll) When the negotiations for obtaining a trawler from U.Ih finally brokeYdowu, plans' were prepared, through AIOC r s ^ London Office, for a 70 ft trawler to he built at Kuweit* This work has however not yet been put in hand* Though the Kuweit builders could probably handle the jet satisfactorily there are present difficulties coimected with timber supplies and other contracts (See Note Vlll). I am of the opinion that if a trawler is to be built for AIOG a vessel of 90~100ft would be preferable to the present specifications. The latter appears to have been drawn up in forgetfulness of the fact that 70ft was a limit set simply by the earlier possibility of transport from U. K* on the clock of a merchant vessel* The specifications in ipy view should also be modified in other ^ ways. In particular I consider that it would bo wise to '' provide full refrigeration, (not simply cooling) machinery, from the beginning* (These matters are treated at length in Note IX) The larger vessel recommended would also of course require a larger engine than that.planned for the 70ft vessel. It is a too general assumption that if only a trawler is available it can be sent to sea and large quantities of fish will at once be caught* This may be a dangerous assumption when applied to tropical.waters* The available evidence for the success of trawling at the head Qf the Persian Gulf is not extensive, ^ b In 1936-38 Dr. Blogvad, a Dane who was .carrying out experi mental fishery work for the Persian Government, had moderate success in a small number of trawling experiments in the area in question (See Note X), * However it is widely stated that during the yar of 1914-18 the British army arranged for cer tain trawling at the'head of the Gulf, and that this met with cnought success to-'-keep a. large hospital and various ^ units regularly supplied with fresh fish in-the Basra region*, Mr* Grice, Director General of Local Products, Iraq Govern ment, in particular, from his long experience Gatiiig from the last war, assured me that this was so* It would seem evident that there is enough evidence to. justify considerable efforts on the part of AIOC to develop local trawling and to provide Itself for the purpose with a ^ fully equipped refrigerating trawler of 90-100ft length.' .This course is recommended* For further details (See Notes IX and X)* However it needs to be realized that the product of one such vessel, whether obtained by its own trawling activity, or by fishing by other not methods (See ITote Vll), and even if backed up by it engaging in fish collection from native fishermen further down the Gulf, is unlikely to bring the total of fresh fish available at Abadan up to the prelimi nary target set at 3000 tons per year* The question for decision by the ill 00 is then a multiple one* Given the desire for a really substantial increase of fresh fish supplies at Abadan, shall the necessary 90-100 ft. vessel be limited to one (which by itself cannot fully/* * ♦ * ♦ *( -7- ^ vv fully meet tho need ), and shall this (these) vessel(s) Too huilt at Kuucit despite the' difficulties (set cut in Note Vlll), or further efforts he made to chta:,n delivery from U« K. where negotiations so far have 'been fruitless? In reaching the solution the time factor is clearly of great importance, as is &amp; clrification of AIOC l s postwar intentions with regard to the feeding of Labour. Thus an outsider cannot fairly he dogmatic about the solution, hut it may reasonably he suggested that the wise course would he to embark on construction at Kuweit and at the same time re-open negotiations in U.K. The presence, of two vessels at some future date will not result in over production. There is some evidence that renewed efforts to obtain a vessel from U.K. might now lead to success. d. P rovi sion of Vitamins ? . c: D from Fish Source s. The pro-• vision of reg'ular and ample supplies of fresh fish at Abadan and thence to out-stations, should in some degree automatical ly meet the deficiency of vitamins A and D, noted by Dr. MeikleJohn, However, it will probably still_remain desirable to make available concentrated supplies of vitamins A and L. It is understood that producers such as South Africa are ■unwilling to supply concentrates for the use of Labour such as that at Abadan when supplies to European po pulations elsewhere are scarecely adequate. The supply of fish oils from the fisheries of the Arabian and Persian coasts would seem to provide the rational solution. Uni or- tunately shark products are not acceptable. However, './ell prepared sardine oil should be obtainable, through Government of Aden if not from the Persian Gulf itself. D ardine oil from Mukalla it is understood has been successfully used for pharma.ceutical'purposes by Government hospital Aden. It may thus meet the AICC requirements. (See Note Kill). The unfortunate fact that the AIOC ? s Moslem labour finds shark unacceptable has already been mentioned. In the view of those of the Company responsible, it would not even be safe to provide vitamins in the form of encapsulated shark oil, for fear of repercussions should the source be discovered* It is considered however that from the purely practical point of view the provision of vitamin concentrates in such a form is feasible*• c \TL H Q T ^, 1 .

AED DISTRIBUTIOH SCHEME AT ABADAIA This highly successful fresh fish collection schene, mlciny use of available local fi she men and their traps, is catchinp fish at a rate of aaout 800 tons per year* The fish are divided into several categories, Mst quality heinj sold to Staff in the Company 1 s retail sliops, 2nd quality mainly yoinp to the Staff restaurant, and 3rd quality heiny sold at a fixed price throuyh the Municipal fish haeaar, v/hich is under AIOC control. Those three categories arc “based on the species of fish primrily, hut occasionally when 1st quality fish has deteriorated sliyhtly on account of slow transport, it may he sold off as 3rd quality.

The largo fish are gutted on the spot. The catch is then quichly delivered at a not far distant point to an anchored collecting launch provided by the Company.

At the same time a cleric records the weights, issues receipts for the fish, and uomplotos the paper side of the transaction* The launch then travels the •30 odd miles up the Shatt el Arab river to Abadan, bearing the load of up to 3 tons of,fish* • There is room for improvement in the icing of the fish in the launches* At Abadan the higher quality fish for Staff Use is unloaded into a waiting lorry* There it is stowed, again by .hand, in bulk with a moderate amount of ice for its short joUrrxey, at an air tempe rature of perhaps even 115 °F* in summe'r, to the Ootyjany* s cold store* Arrived there, the 1st quality whole fish are kept cool ready for disposal through the staff shops.

At the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab a large grey fish, locally termed 'Shamahi”, is caught with short lengths of' netting of about 4 M bar set as a wall on the bottom. It is explained that the fish are heard by a specially trained man who lies with his ear to the bottom of the boat and then directs his fellows where to paddle. When he reports fish, -the net is quickly set and soon hauled again with its load of entangled fish of this species, the individuals averaging 25 lbs weight. Other nets both coarse and fine are used to some extent, but the large traps appear to be by far the most important catching method in the area. Hooks too are used but only to a small extent. Ho evidence was obtained of any important shortage of fishing gear, a reflection, probably, of the fact that traps are the chief method of catching. HOTS IV . LAUNCHES FOR THE PRESENT AIOC FRESH FISH COLLECTION SCHEME. The present successful fresh fish scheme at Abadan, which no- handles fish at roughly, the rate of 800 tons per year, necess itates regular collection by AIOC launches sent about 35 miles dov/n to the mouth, of the Shatt daily for tk^at purpose. Reliability of the launches is most important. Several launches are used, of somewhat varying size, but the average load whicn can be carried approaches three tuns of fish with ice. Any extension of the scheme requires an improvement in reliability and sea-worthiness, if not in number, of the launches available for this duty. For example, if the highly desirable and already contemplated extension of the scheme to Kharg Island and EIndian is to be carried out, this problem of the collecting launches certainly requires attention. It was for this reason that the 70 ft twin screw motor vessel 'Atlas!' was the subject of special consider ation while I was at Abadan. alfnLe 1 InPfron'n m It is only necessary to state here, m further ex planation, that AIOC are loath to re-acquire her from the Naval authorities because of a bad record at sea and the condition of her engines, * At '(a) It is evident that with the-launches at present available for use in the existing fish collection scheme, no expansion is possible, and there may be a shrinkage, (b) The launches at present used in the fish collection scheme are in imminent danger of breaking down completely with a resultant decrease in the fresh fish available. (Two of the launches, I am told, have already long been condemned but have had to'be brought back into service;. (c) No alternative launch(es) appears to be available. (d) 'ATLASI', with suitable modification, could become a m#st useful collecting launch with greater speed, reliability, and range than the existing launches used in fish collection. Her sea-g*ing Vunl'itl^ 9^.qualities and the condition of her engine are probably not of a high order but they should be sufficient and they are certainly better than those of sone of the present launches. (e) Several or many months will elap-se before a trawler or other fishing craft becomes available. Though 'ATLA5I' is not herself suitable for trawling, she may be suitable for seine net work. In any event she should provide Skipper Burwood with the opportunity of carrying out necessary initial experimental work. (f) When a real fishing vessel does become available it will still be necessary to continue the fish collection scheme. The main items in the conversion of M AT3L.SI H to the new task would include (a) stripping all the accommodation, with the exception of the saloon aft, to form a large insulated fish room; (b) cutting down to deck level the raised parts forward of the wheel house:; (g) raising the height of the engine room to deck level. The result of (b) and (c) would be to obliterate the saloon amidships and provide a large fore-deck.' The acquirement of 'Atlasi' awaits decision by AIOC. The need for reliable launches remains whether the present fresh fish scheme is to continue in its present form or, as is more desirable, it is to be expanded to the greatest possible extent. At ablator date it may well be found that, if a trawler has become available as hoped, she can sometimes more profitably be used to collect from native fishermen far afield instead of fish ing alone. Perhaps a combination of fishing and collection nay come to be the normal practise. Experience alone will show. NOTE V . DRIED PISH. The drying of fish, usually following a preliminary salt ing, and^sometimes accompanied by smoking, is the indigenous method of handling surplus fish in Arabian waters. Large quantities of dried fish of various species from the south coast of Arabia and tfcx Gulf-Oman, regularly enter the Indian Ocean dhow traffic and so reach India and East Africa. There is a similar regular trade in dried fish up the Gulf to Basra and elsewhere. In the body of this Report it is recommended that quanti- ties of this dried fish should be brought to Abadan, temporarily to fill the gap betv/een actual fresh fish supplies and the desirable target. A large proportion- *f the southern Arabian dried fish is shark, which is not acceptable by certain Moslems. The AIOC labour at Abadan unfortunately^belongs to one such group. Thus other species of dried fish will have to be made available for them, such ?. S _-_ tunny and .kingfish^and som§ of the smaller types. These how- evex, ax-e available and some or them are already on sale in Abadan usually, it is said, at prices which are too high for the labourers to pay regularly. The common type is 'Khubart', a tuna-tribe fish, about 18' long, wdiich was seen on sale at 3 rials ? er v :1 ^ 0, this was cheaper than usually because it had deter iorated somewhat with age. Another type, 'Umtout' tiny dried fish (probably anchovy) / ,..(probably anchovy) v/ere on sale at 4 rials per kilo. Picked and A shelled dried prawns in Abadan were on sale at 50 rials rer kilo in the bazaar. .... cfcief enemy of dried fish is insect infestation but, if AxOC made bulk imports, this could be limited by storage in a cool place and possibly by fumigation, AI00 have already tried importing dried prawns for staff use but this unfortunately was a failure on account of the age of the consignment bought. The prawns were finally being fed to the Company’s pigs. v NOTE VI , AVAILABILITY OF ICE AT ABADAN. Any extension of the present will require greater quantities of ice. available from the Company’s present ic gh liev'ed that extra ice may be obtainable urawler, unless * fitted, as recommended, ment, would require large quantities of availability.

It is said that not more^than one day’s_production can be stored so that the surplus manufacturing capacity of the colder months cannot be stored for lauer use. This storage difficulty however, could presumably be a... come with moderate ease and ingenuity. One may recall that in Cf,ntiw y winter ice j.rom the Baltic v/as taken in sawdust in t sailing vessels round the Cape for use in India. The xact that during^storage the separate blocks of ice may merge into a solid mass is immaterial because broken ice is suitable for fish- NOTE VII .

In Persian Gulf waters AIOC should insist on the proper recording of every item of information because it is all new and therefore valuable. The recording of negative evidence too should throughout be insisted upon. Considerable experiment will be advisable over a long period with different types of gear once the Company’s own fishr ing vessel(s) is at work. It is probably true to say that gener ally in the warmer seas of the world, a greater proportion of the more valuable fish live in shoals in the surface waters, while in the colder seas the better fish tend to be bottom livers. As a result of this difference in habit, it may well be that the trawl will gradually be found to be a less useful catching mechanism in tropical waters than it has proved to be in temperate and cold water areas. The purse-seine, ring-net and lampara (using lights at night) may well be found more successful than trawling. Again experience alone can tell. The initiative of the skipper and the careful recording of results in the earlier stages must clearly be of great importance. It is understood that there are a number of trawls lying ■unused, and unlikely to be used, at the Persian Government’s fish factory at Bundar Abbas. AIOC may perhaps see fit to negotiate to obtain these at a low rate. Long storage at Gulf temperatures must gradually lead to deterioration. NOTE VIII . BOAT BUILDING AT KUWEIT. Kuweit is famed throughout the Indian ocean and Arab seas fur its dhows. It is said that more and better dhows are built there than at any other place on the whole coast of Arabia. AIOC has had launches built at Kuweit and has confidence in the ability of the ouilders to fashion a trawler to the desired specifications. At present the Kuweit builders seem to be fully occupied with large assembly contracts for the Inland Water Transport author ities. I was given to understand that at present any building for AIOC might involve a question of relative priorities. At Kuweit too I was informed that there is now available there insufficient timber (teak from India) to undertake a trawler for AIOC and that the Company would have to make arrangements for special import from India. Thus the speedy building at Kuweit of a trawler appears v to present a variety of difficulties. NOTE'IX . THE TRAWLEB FOB ABADAN. Since return from Abadan the turn of events and informa tion available suggests that further representations in London for the release of a trawler for AIOC use-might now lead to a favourable response. Even so the vessel from U.K. would require considerable modification before being fit for service at Abadan. It must I think be evident that the goal should be a vessel fitted with full refrigeration and the power to freeze and store / « * *for work in the G-ulf, would, in my view, be short-sighted. If the provision of the necessary machinery for full refriger ation is, ^in the first instance, not available, the vessel could' operate with ice temporarily. ( e ^ Refri geration Plant . The opinion of a Refrigeration Engineer needs to be sought. A somewhat similar vessel, recently fitted out and now operating successfully in the Gulf of Aqaba, has a Ruston l^ 1 H.P. Engine operating a compressor with ammonia as the refriger ant. The fish is frozen in trays resting directly on the freezing pipes. The fish is cooled rapidly to 0 - 4° F. and then stored .at about 14° F. Thus treated it will last many months. (F.S. For ’’many” read 'several”). () ^Fish Room. ^ The whole fish room, not only the lower parts, should be metal-lined to allow of adequate scouring without wetting the insulation. A proper sump and pumps, to take drainage and washings from the fish room, are needed, (g) Insulation. The specification is for ”10 inches' of granu- a 'y • ' cctk or other approved material'. Slab cork is better and is now fairly easily available from North Africa, It would probably ^ insulation in view of the extreme temperature c Iditions to be met. (k) Ship * s Stores . The present layout provides virtually no space for ship’s stores and fishing equipment. ^ The larger hull recommend ed would allow for this. (i) Fres h I/ater Tanks . The capacity of the proposed fresh water tanit is inadequate. • (j) Maste r’s. Quarters . These could be better arranged. At ore- sent there is excessive subdivision. I suggest a sizeable deck' cabin only, but properly shut off from the wheel house.” NOTE A . TRAWLING AT THE HEAD OF THE PERSIAN GULF. It has too easily been assumed that the provision of a trawler at Abadan would solve the fresh .fish problem.. This may or may not be so but the evidence seems to justify a full-scale trial, and without this the answer cannot be known; .In the winter seasons of 1936/7 and 1937/8, Dr. Blegvad, at that time Danish fishery adviser to the Persian Government, carried out certain experiments in trawling from his 59-ton motor vc sel. The number of trials at the head of the Gulf was small and the type of gear used is not well described. In his report to the Persian Government in 1938 he gave the numbers of fish caught m each trial haul but not their weights nor sizes.. However, he stated that the proportion of good quality fisb taken by trawl was higher at the herd of the Gulf than elsewhere. He mentioned his best haul of first category fish as being 1100 kilos in one hour’s trawling off Shaikh Shu’aib island, which is close to the Persian coast north-east of the tip of the Qatar Peninsula. He was an experienced investigator and he expressed himself in optimistic terms as to future fishery developments in the Gulf. His main rocommehdat ion ^ho T wever, was the establishment of the sardine canning factory at Bun da r Abbas, leaving fishery development at the head of tao Gillf for a later date when more experience had been gained. . f There is evidence that during the war of 1914-1918 the Army authorities arranged for one or more trawlers to work at the head / . . .mmm ■■■■■■■■■Ml store not loss than say 20 tons of fish. Preferably free&amp;ing should be rapid down to near zero Fahrenheit, at a rate of say 2-tons daii;,, while storage aboard could be at say plus 10-14° F. Stcrage ashore should likewise be at 10-14° F, Such storage would allow consider able seasonal fluctuations in catch to be smoothed out. Even if full refrigeration is not provided in the trawler for A IOC, insulation of all fish spaces with not less than 10-12” of cork will still be necessary. In addition, large quantities of icc will be needed which are not available from AIOC’s own present re sources, The amount of ice needed to cool 1 ton of fish down to -f 32° F. is great, as will be realised when it is remembered that the fish when caught may be nearly at human blood temperature. To fit a trawler with cooling machinery, to bring the fish down to around J&gt;2° F. without the use of ice, would still require heavy insulation and in my opinion would be an inadequate compromise lacking in vision. Thus I strongly recommend that if any trawler be built or obtained for use at Abadan, . she should be properly fitted with re frigerating machinery from the beginning. The proportionate addi tional costs in money, materials, and difficulty are small. This recommendation holds even .if a trawler, fully equipped by U.K. stan dards, is brought out to Abadan. Such a vessel will require, either before or after delivery, to have her fish spaces properly insulated, and this necessity would provide the opportunity to fit full refriger ation . &lt;*•* If the trawler for Abadan is to be built at Kuweit, my re commendations set out in Interim Report II of 23.7-44. still stand. For convenience these recommendations are repeated below:- ” TRAWLER SPECIFICATIONS ♦ I have studied specifications and a plan for a ”Proposed Fishing Boat for Abadan”, the papers being dated 3-3-44 and both having been prepared in London. I have discussed th'e specifications and plan with Mr. Dobson and at greater length with Mr. Burwood. The following opinions should be read as comments upon the London Speci fications and plan. They have been discussed with Mr. Burwood who agrees. My recommendation is that building at Kuweit be pressed ahead with minimal delay and that the suggested modifications be in corporated. (a) Overall size. 18i feet respectively, and 22 feet. The proposed length and beam are 70 feet and These should be increased to about 90 feet The’ reason for limitation to 70 feet has now disappeared, namely the expected necessity of shipping the vessel on deck from U.K. The main reasons for increased size are to give greater range, power and fish capacity, (b) Engine . With increased size, engine power must be suitably increased from the proposed 100 H.P. Engineering opinion must be sought on this point. The answer will probably lie around 130 H.P. Both speed and towing power, are important. (c) Fish capacity . The present capacity, I think, would not each exceed about 3 tons of fish in ice. In my opinion this is inadequate, (P.S. 5 tons was perhaps an underestimate but the space I still con sider inadequate.) (d) Refrigeration . The pre-sent plan is for the vessel to work with ice, but with an indication that refrigeration might be' fitted later. I fancy that the refrigeration envisaged in the Specifications is simply cooling to F. and not genuine refrigeration. This subject will be covered in full in my Final Report, but my opinion is that full refrigeration should be the goal from the beginning. This would eliminate the use of ice (which is already in short supply), would greatly extend the range and carrying capacity of the vessel, would preserve the fish almost indefinitely, and would allow the building up on shore of a real accumulation of frozen fish to tide over shortages. Not to fit full refrigeration in a new vessel built for work / ...iu/ r i ^• th ® il ®'- d . of tile Gulf t0 provide fresh fish to hospitals and units.

A Kuweit’s position close to the Iraq and Iran !=’- th ^ trade of Kuweit has flourished during the war. in especial contrast with the serious wartime disruption of the dhow trade / ..., the ahow trade of southern Arabia. In one war year in fact Kuweit dhows brought in enough Indian timber to build mere dhows than in a* normal pre-war year. The fish taken at Kuweit for local use are caught mostly m the summer it is said. The species seen on sale were mostl v members of the mackerel-tuna group. The large traps (see Note III) S ? e ^ t0 main fi ? hin g method: . The island of Failaka, a part of the Sheikhdom, provides a large proportion of the fish. Prawns are taken in large numbers in the winter by a local method of trawl ing using two vessels sailing as a pair. ♦ o P rawns are &lt;iried for gradual use throughout the year, borne dried fish too is regularly imported for local use, but fresh fish is much preferred. The chief dried salt fish brought from the 2 f r? an ar 1 e Khubart' which is probably the same as the M Derak M vhingi ish; of the south coast of Arabia, and ”Uma n (’’Sardines”) . since the Kuweit dhows are the carriers of dried fish from the Gulf Ox Oman to Basra and elsewhere, the hometown selects what it wants en -£ 0U 4 ^‘ t&gt; ? rie , d MLokiiamM (shark) is net eaten by the townsfolk, only oy the Bedu who camp both within and without the town walls. Because of the flourishing dhow trade, the main catching o traps ^and the general smallness of the fishery, there is no shortage of fishing materials at Kuweit, and prices still seem to be reasonable. Coir rope is available in plenty. ^ NOTE XII . BAHREIN FISHERY ETC. ^ Whereas the people of Kuweit are the ocean-going dhow builders, long-distance traders and subsidiary pearl-fishers, the people of Bahrein are primarily pearl-fishers, and secondarily mer chants m the Gulf dhow trade. Fishing activities at both places are secondary and for local consumption only. Bahrein differs from Kuweit in that there are present large new demands for labour for oil work * x]le result hov/ever is the same, a local shortage of fish and increased prices for it. ^ a f n etching method is the use of the large fixed traps ivhioh work best m winter, and small basket traps in deeper water in summer Prawns are caught at all seasons mainly in large traps.

NOTE XIII . FISH OIL AS A SOURCE OF VITAMINS A &amp; D FOR AIOC LABOUR. Fish body and liver oils are often rich in vitamins A a D, though to greatly varying extents with different species of fish. The unacceptability of shark products for AIOC labour has been re ferred to elsewhere. The-fish til already available in great quan tity is sardine body oil, extracted by crude means along the south coast of Arabia. Large quantities of this oil are available and enter the Indian ocean and Persian Gulf dhow trades. The normal use for the oil is as a preservative for the woodwork of all classes of boat. It is on sale in Abadan. It is probable that as a result of the crude method of manufacture the whole vitamin content has bees lost. However AICC are recommended to test the trade sardine oil in case useful quantities of vitamins A &amp; L still remain. A few years ago the Government of Aden, as a demonstration for the,improved extraction of sardine oil, arranged for a simple boiler and press to be set up at Mukalla. When well tended, this small plant produced a much superior oil. Samples of this oil were filtered through charcoal and used medicinally with success, it is stated, instead of cod liver oil in the Government hospital at Aden. For a variety of reasons the simple plant at Mukalla is not at present in use but it might be possible for the Government of Aden, by AIOC, to arrange for it to be produce good quality sardine oil put in operation for Abadan. pre: request for a short time to on As a first step it is suggested that AIOC should ask the Government Health .Department, Aden, for a report on the sardine oil with special reference to its vitamin content. AICC might also enquire from the Persian Government whether sardine oil could be prepared in moderate quantities at the Government fish factory at Bundar Abbas. There, ,it is understood, sardines in the winter season are being caught, unless fishing is restricted, Ll larger quantities than the factory can handle on account of shortage of tinplate, olive oil etc. NOTE XIV , ISINGLASS It is interesting to note that the species of fish, locally termed ”Shamahi ,f at Abadan, is a source of isinglass. On gutting the fish, each of which weighs about 25 lbs, the fishermen take the air- bladders and carefully dry them. The eventual destination, it is said, used to be Japan, while now they go to India! NOTE XV. THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT FISH FACTORY AT BUNDAR ABBAS.- The Persian Government has at Bundar Abbas a modern fish canning factory, erected just before the war on the advice of Dr. Blegvad / ...iPl | ii | n 'WI|M wmm MM \ ^ I wt? • • '****» J ^ n Blegvad, the Danish fishery expert. The primary aim of the under-\ taking was the canning of sardines and prawns for expert, out so^far prawns have not been handled. The technical side of the work is managed by several Danes employed by the Persian Government. So- far the. factory has worked at much below full capacity because of a shortage of tin-plate, olive oil and rubber bands, its best output so far being half a million 110 gram (nett weight) tins (i.e. 50 tons of sardines) in the winter season November 1943 to March 1944. I understand that the selling price of the product is far higher than is properly justifiable. I have not seen the factory, only photographs of it, but have talked with Mr. F.T. Hansen, 'Spdcialiste de Conserves', who has been mainly responsible for the quality of the product. In his view the standard of canning is high, but the quality of the sardines not all that could be wished. He is quite confident that, from the species available at Bundar Abbas, he could prepare a hard-smoked fish which would be highly acceptable jit Abadan. Such a product he states could be made with a keeping life sufficient to reach Abadan in first class condition if transport was direct. The Anglo-Iranian Oil C^. might well investigate this matter. Any such product could presumably be brought up to Abadan sufficiently quickly in one of the Company^ own small vessels en- yy gaged in petrol distribution in the Gulf./ compliments to The lolitical ^gent, Bahrain.

SUMMARY O F CONCLUSIONS AM) RECOMMENDATIONS A preliminary target for the.production of fresh fish at Abadan for the feeding of. AIOC Staff and Labour may be set at 3000 tons per year* At present about 800 tons per year is available in a collection scheme from the local fishermen# This scheme can probably be enlarged to sosac extent but the target cannot be approached without the aid of more productive modern methods. Trawling has been suggested and would pro bably be effective# Renewed exertions arc needed to provide one (or two) trawlers or long-distance collecting vessels of 90-100 ft length with refrigerating machinery# As envisaged by AIOC, such a vessel might be built at Kuweit, At the same time it is recommended that further negotiations be started in U. K#. In any event it will probably bo not loss than a yoar before such a vessel is at worlc, and meanwhile the gap, be tween present production and the target, it is suggested, should be filled by the import of dried fish from the Gulf of Oman# The requirements of vitamins .A &amp; D it is suggested possibly might bo mot, by the use of sardine oil which is available from the fisheries of the Arabian coasts# IITTRODUCTIOH. A recent special investigation by Dr* Mcikle john, of the Roclcfcller Foundation, has shown that the diet at present available to the AngLo-Iranian Oil Co T s labour at Abadan is deficient in animal pretein and vitamin A, vegetables and vitamin C, and perhaps also vitamin D. Dr* McihlcJohn*s con clusions wero based on comprehensive evidence embracing clini cal tests, foods available and so on# The provision of ade quate quantities of fish from the Persian Gulf at once presen ted itself as an obvious method of mooting the protein defi ciency and, perhaps too, the shortage of vitamins A &amp; D# M. E#S. C# therefore directed me to investigate the fishery pro blem# My travels in connection with the problem extended from 7th July when I arrived at Abadan to 4th August when I loft Teheran, and included visits to Kuweit and Bahrein. I an most grateful to all those at Abadan, Kuweit, Bahrein and Teheran v/ho were so kind in providing me with in formation and hospitality, thus making my tour of groat interest and, I hope, ensuring its worth# Those with whom conversations were held on various aspects uf the general problem are listed in Note I. In order to see the main problems in reasonable propor tions it is helpful to have a good deal of the background information easily available# So far as possible this is * relegated to a series of notes at the end of this Report, and reference is made by number in the text. Thus it is hoped that this Report may be of interest to more than those directly concerned with the solution of the central problems* Brief, written. Interim Reports were given to AIOC on 16th and 23rd July and discussed in detail*, The conclusions and recommendations there set out are incorporated and expanded in this present final Report, but are not modified in substance, though perhaps a little in relative stress as the evidence gradually became available* C. General/# • • * •«2 - 0. GENERAL. Dr* Meiklejolm's conclusion that the lar^o AIOG Labour force lias an imperfect diet is indisputable* Whether its im~ pcrfecrtion is much greater than is common among Middle Eastern people in peace time is more doubtfull* Some would even say that the AIOC Labour' is now better fed in war time that it was previously in peace, with however some important exceptions* % that as it may, the present and future work of the AIOC, in oiling the Far East war 9 is of such paramount importance that no risk is justified* Great efforts to improve the diet of the labour foroo v^auld still seem worthy even if the result is a considerably higher nutritional level than the average for the Middle East* The extraordinarily trying climate of Abadan and the long hours of hard work: also have to-be borne in mind when considering the diet of AIOC Labour in relation to food availibilities in nearby territories* A further point of importance is that to the majority of the AIOC labour force the surroundings and climate of Abadan are almost as foreign as to a European, Senior Iranian or Indian member of the Staff. Most of the labourers cone, it is stated, from the hill country Persia where meat and vegetables arc freely available and where the climate is less extreme* It. is to bo noted that the labourers by upbringing are meat, and not fish, eaters. In peace tine moderate quanti ties of meat were available to them, but those have diminished absolutely and relatively during the war at the same time as the labour force has grown. This explains to a large extent what might have been the expected prewar natural adjustment between local fish catching and the new centre of population at Abadan which has boon expanding for over 3C years. . The population of Abadan, som^ 35 miles from the open water of the Gulf, has continued to look landward for its food and well being* All the othem older and smaller population centres on the shores of tho Persian Gulf derive their food and prosperity mainly from maritime sources, for example Kuweit, Bahrein, Muscat etc. The AI0.C has now, under tne pressure of war, become higlily conscious of this maladjustment between tho protein- poverty of the diet of the labour force and the abundance of fish* (but not of fishermen), in the nearby waters of the Persian Gulf* Some successful steps have already boon taken to meet the need by regular collections from local fisherman* Thp desire is strong to go far further. This necessitates the Company itself entering the fishery with modern vessles and productive methods of catching, for .. example by trawling. Such enterprise the Company appears willing to embark upon at the present time, though really of a long term nature* There seem however to bo differences of opinion as to tho post war policy of the Company over the feeding of its many thousands of labourers* The primary aim of the AIOC being oil production there is a desire, in some minds, to leave such matters as the feeding of workers after the war, to the normal traders of Persia* others fool that this may novor be entirely satisfactory and that tho food pro gramme on which the Company has boon forced to embark under the stress of war, will have to be continued into tho peace* This ls/i ■*15 -4- Tho fish collocted in this scheme varies in species and in amount from month to month, the winter 'being a season of re lative scarcity* The fish is divided into three categories by species, the third quality in European estimation being sold at fixed rates to the labourers, while the first two grades arc reserved for Staff# Of the total weight of fish caught the 4000 odd Staff and families at present receive about half and the 100,000 labourers (again including resident dependents) receive the other half# ■ Worked out extremely roughly on an average monthly basis, and smoothing out seasonal fluctuations, it may bo said that the prosbnt collection and distribution scheme provides the Staff with about a dozen pounds of. whole fresh fish per head per month and the Abadan labour force with about 1 lb of wholo fresh fish per head per month. The Staff it is stated could well do with rather more fresh : fish at most seasons of tho year, while the clamour in the municipal market at tho time of distribution is a sure indica tion of the desire for more cheap fish on the part of the Labour being very far from satisfied# Further details will bo found in Notes II, III, and IV# Dried Fish # Certain quantities of native-type salted, dried , f'isli'are ’regularly on sale in the Abadan bazaar# This is imported by dhow, by native contractors, from the southern end of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman# (see Note V). Dried prawns arc also imported from Bundar Abbas and elsewhere# Whether or not this dried fish in fact is providing a signifi cant part of the animal protein available to the native labour is unknown, but perhaps will become apparent when Dr# Meiklejohn's full Report is received# This dried fish is certainly appre ciated by the people but the impression was gained that it is too expensive at present for them to buy as much as they, would like# F. FISHERY DEVELOPMENTS . It is evident that there is a great gap between the pre liminary target of 3000 tons of fresh fish per year to be landed at Abadan and the present availibility, namely 800 tons per year of fresh fish plus an undetermined, but moderate, quantity of dried fish. To fill the gap and roach, this initial and rather humble target, will require groat exertion and a good deal of time, probably not less than a year# The methods by which tho gap may be filled are set out below. a. Import of dried fish . Because of the inevitable and .considerable time lag which will occur before the fresh fish available at Abadan ca-n be largely increased, it is recommended that at once quantities of dried fish should bo imported and made available to tho labour force at prices which they can easily afford. Such bulk import by AIQC should be quite easily arranged# Tho dried fish, it is suggested, could be brought up to Abadan in the Company’s own small vessels which deliver cased petrol to such plaoes as Sharja, Bundar Abbas, Muscat and Masira Island and Salala. These plaoes are centres, of popula tion in the main fishing regions, from which dried fish is nor mally exported in the Indian Ocean dhow traffic#V ti 'A •%- - 5 - It is recommended that trial consignments be made available as quichly as possible at Abadan. When reactions have been ooserved the import could quickly be expanded or suitably modified# Various types and qualities of dried fish 2 ro ^ a r ai1 . le and ©xperment an a_ observation will be needed to deternnne what is must suitable ur acceptable# The Persian labourers are stated mostly to belong to a Moslem cUscu SS °cd m in Note^VV S n0t aco ^ table * fish further It might also well be worth while suggesting to the Persian Government that its fish canning factory at Bundar Abbas should ry making special types of hards moked fish for use at Abadan.

Attempts were then made to obtain x,, trawler ./hich it was hoped could jo shipped to Abadan 0 t, a cargo vessel# This plan boo proved impossible. 0i oAC Paalure of these negotiations but the ouoocss ^ 0 ^ r ^^ements, is that AIOC new has at Abadan frori a uc ' 1 ^~ iod trawler skipper, recently arrived »t ' rdGen ^t no trawler# Mr. Burwood is a mn of solf- . ^ ldcnce f fully conversant with the major fishing methods used Pining for a vessel with which to investi gate the possibilities of the Persixm Gulf# Every facility should/# • •.. #T 1 —O'- should he Given for him to oo.rrv out v/hntever initial experi mental fishery work may ho possible using' the collecting launches available (See Notes IV and VllJ, It would he well for him to study arahic. The careful recording, of the results of experiments and of all fishing grounds, must he insisted upon (See Note Vll) 31 When the negotiations for obtaining a trawler from U, Id finally hr oke^ down, plans* were prepared * through AIOC f s London Office, for a 70 ft trawler to he built at Kuweit* This work has however not yet been put in hand* Though the Kuweit builders could probably Nandle the job satisfactorily there are present difficulties connected with timber supplies and other contracts (See Note Vlll). I am of the.opinion that if a trawler is to be built for AIOG a vessel of-90-100ffc would be preferable to the present specifications* The latter appears to have been drawn up in forgetfulness of the fact that 70ft was a limit set simply by the earlier possibility of transport from U. X, on the dock of a merchant vessel. The specifications in my view should also be modified in other ways • In particular I consider that it would bo wise to provide full refrigeration, (not simply eooling) machinery, from the beginning* (These matters are treated at length in 'he larger vessel r( Note IX) require a larger engine than i commended would, also of c our so it planned for the 70ft vessel. It is a too general assumption that if only a trawler is available it can bo sent to sea and large quantities of fish will at once be-caught. This maybe a dangerous assumption when applied to tropical waters* The available evidence for the success of trawling at the head of the Persian Gulf is not extensive* In 1936-38 Dr. Blcgvad, a Dane who was carrying out experi mental fishery work-for the Persian Government, had moderate success in a small number in question (See Note X). during the war of 1914-18 tain trawling at the head of trawling experiments in- the area However it is widely stated that the British army arranged for cer- of the Gulf, and that this met with enought success to keep a large hospital and various units regularly supplied with fresh fish in the Basra region. Mr# Grice, Director General of Local Products, Iraq Govern ment, in particular, from his long experience dating from the last war, assured me that this was so# It would seem evident that there is enough evidence to justify considerable efforts on the part of AIOG to develop local trawling and to provide itself for the purpose with a fully equipped refrigerating trawler of 90-100ft length.- This course is recommended. For further details (See Notes IX and X) • However it needs to be realized that the product of one such vessel, whether obtained by its own trawling activity, or by fishing by other net methods (See Note Vll), and even if backed up by it engaging in fish collection from native fishermen further down-the Gulf, total of fresh fish available at nary target set at 3000 tons per is unlikely to bring the Abadan up to the prelimi- year. The question for decision by the AIOC is then a multiple one# Given the desire for a really substantial increase of fresh fish supplies at Abadan, shall the necessary 90-100 ft* vess Cl be limited to one (which by itself cannot fully/.«* *.»~ 1 ,IJ -7- fully meet the need), and shall this (those) vessel(s) ho built at Kuweit despite the difficulties (set cut in Note Vlll ) f or further efforts he made to obtain delivery from U«K* where negotiations so far have been fruitless? In reaching the solution the time factor is clearly of yreat importance^ as is a clrification of AIOC l s postwar intentions with regard to the feeding of Labour. Thus an outsider cannot fairly be dogmatic about the solution, but it may reasonably be suggested that the wise course would be to embark on construction at Kuweit and at the same time re-open negotiations in U.X. The presence of two vessels at some future date will not result in over production. There is some evidence that renewed efforts to obtain a^ vessel from U.K. might now lead to success. a. Provi sion o f Vitamins anrolc D from Fish Sources . The pro vision of regular and ample supplies of fresh fish at Abadan and thence to out-stations, should in some degree automatical ly meet the deficiency of vitamins A and L, noted by Dr. Meiklejohru, However, it will probably still remain desirable to make available concentrated supplies of vitamins ‘ and L. It is understood that producers such as South Africa are unwilling to supply concentrates Labour such as that at Abadan when supplies pulaticns elsewhere are scarecely adequate, fish oils from the fisheries of the Arabian coasts would seem to provide the rational solution, tunately shark products are not acceptable. However, prepared sardine oil should be obtainable, through Government of Aden if not from the Persian Gulf itself. Sardine oil from Mukalla it is understood has been successfully used for pharmaceutical purposes by Government Hospital; Aden, may thus meet the AIOC requirements* (See Note Kill). for the use of to Europeai*! po- The supply of and Persian Unfor- well The unfortunate fact that the AIOC 1 o Moslem labour finds shark unacceptable has already been mentioned. In the vie., of those of the Company responsible, it would not even be safe to provide vitamins in the form of encapsulated shark oil, for fear of repercussions should the source be^discovered* It is considered however that from the purely practical point of view the provision of vitamin concentrates in such a form is feasible*PPOPLE \7IiH \7K0M FISHERY l HATERS MERE DI3CU, SEE* ABAEAH - AIOC.

PRESSiTT FRESH FISH GOLLECTIOII AHD DI S TRIBURIOH ^GHELIR RT This successful fresh fish collection scheme, mhiny use of available local fishermen and their traps, is^ catchinp fish at a rate of about 800 tons per year* The fish are divided into several categories, 1st quality beiny sold to Staff in the Company^ retail shops, 2nd quality mainly goiny to the Staff restaurant, and 3rd quality beiny sold at a fixed price through the I.Iuaicipal fish bazaar, v;hich is under AIOC control* Those three categories arc based on the species of fish primarily, but occasionally when 1st quality fish has deteriorated slightly on account of slov; transport, it may be sold off as 3rd quality.

VF-s^-a f.t^^L 1 ^ h&gt;3 evident that the goal should be a vessel fitted with full refrigeration and the power to freeze and store / • 00for work in the Gulf, would, in my view, be short-sighted. If the provision of the necessary machinery for full refriger ation is, in the first instance, not available, the vessel could operate with ice temporarily. (e) Refrigeration Plant . The opinion of a Refrigeration Engineer needs to be sought. A somewhat similar vessel, recently fitted out and now operating successfully in the Gulf of Aqaba, has a Ruston 10 H.P. Engine operating a compressor with ammonia as the refriger ant. The fish is frozen in trays resting directly on the freezing pipes* The fish is cooled rapidly to 0 - 4° F. and then stored at about 14° F. Thus treated it will last many months. (P.S. For ’’many’’ read ’’several”) . Fish Room . The v/hole fish room, not only the lower parts, should~be metal-1ined to allow of adequate scouring without wetting the insulation. A proper sump and pumps, to take drainage and washings from the fish room, are needed. (g) Insulation. The specification is for ”10 inches of granu lated cork o~r other approved material”. Slab cork is better and is njw fairly easily available from North Africa. It would probably be wise to fit 12” of insulation in view of the extreme temperature conditions to be met. (h) Shir’s Stores . The present layout provides virtually no 4 space for ship’s stores and fishing equipment. The larger hull recommend ed would allow for this. (i) Fresh Water Tanks . The capacity of the proposed fresh water tank is inadequate. (j) Master’s Quarters . These could be better arranged. At pre sent there is excessive subdivision. I suggest a sizeable deck cabin only, but properly shut off from the wheel house.' NOTE A . TRAWLING AT THE HEAD OF THE PERSIAN GULF. It has too easily been assumed that the provision of a trawler at Abadan would solve the fresh fish problem. This may or may not be so but the evidence seems to justify a full-scale trial, and without this the answer cannot be known. In the winter seasons of 1936/7 and 1937/8# Dr.Blegvad, a^that time Danish fishery adviser to the Persian Government, carried out certain experiments in trawling from his 59-ton motor vessel. The number of trials at the head of the Gulf was small and the type of gear used is not well described. In his report to the Persian Government in 1938 he gave the numbers of fish caught in each trial haul but not their weights nor sizes. However, he stated that the proportion of good quality fish taken by trawl was higher at the head of the Gulf than elsewhere. He mentioned his best haul of first category fish as being 1100 kilos in one hour’s trawling off Shaikh Shu’aib island, which is close to the Persian coast north-east of the tip of the Qatar Peninsula. He was»an experienced investigator and he expressed himself in optimistic terms as to future fishery developments in the Gulf. His main recommendation however, was the establishment of the sardin,e canning factory at Bundar Abbas, leaving fishery development at* the head of the Gulf for a later date when more experience had been gained. There is evidence that during the war of 1914-1918 the British Army authorities arranged for one or more trawlers to work at the head / ..., ..., ' ij :t. ^Z&gt;D store not loss than say 20 tons of fish.

MiSi ^t) at ^ the head of the Gulf to provide fresh fish to hospitals and units* Jhis is believed to have been successful but there is no information .available as to the quantities taken and the effort and gear used. * _ A reading of the ’’Persian Gulf Pilot” suggests that trawl ing should be feasible at the head of the Gulf, and indeed one would not expect troublesome coral within the area directly influenced by the silt from the Shatt el Arab. Points made by the ’’Pilot” (Admir alty Charts Nos. 2837A &amp; 2837B are relevant) are ’’the water in the upper part %f the Gulf is much more salt than that of the ocean”: the Gulf of Oman is very deep, with over 2000 fathoms off Muscat : within the Persian Gulf depths are rarely over 40-50 fathoms and rarely over 20-30 fathoms in its upper part : pearl banks with a depth of less than 20 fathoms occupy about one third of the Gulf’s area : at the head of the Gulf the 20 fathom line is about 50 miles from the river mouth : off the Persian coast and in the deep part of the Gulf, the bottom is generally mud, while on the pearl banks it is hard sand, coral and rock, and in many places off the Arabian coast, especially northward of Bahrein, the bottom is white clay : in the upper part of the Gulf the prevailing wind is NW both summer and winter : sea temperatures are 90-98° F. in summer. Of the fish which a're likely to be taken by trawling in the headwaters of the Gulf, little information is immediately available. ^ Blegvad mentions as being included in his first category fish, and caught in greater proportion there, species of Stromateus, Lutjanus, Serranus, Diagramma^and Pristipoma. The average lengths’ of those he figured for the Persian Government was about 50 cms. The catch of any trawler that may start operations from Abadan is clearly not predictable. This unpredictability is implicit in^most fishery enterprises, but there seems to be enough favourable evidence to justify full scale trials with the expectation of the trials developing into a satisfactory fishery. NOTE XI . KUWEIT FISHERY etc. It has been suggested that the Sheikhdom of Kuweit might be ■used as a source of fresh fish for Abadan.. This is not feasible. The Kuweit Government refused earlier Army suggestions to this end because:- a. there are barely enough boats for the local supply of fish; b. there are no surplus fishermen; c. the price of fish is already too high in Kuweit. The Political Agent states tha£ there is no change of view in the matter and the facts seem fully to justify Kuweit’s policy. No important commodity has increased in price more than fish whose price pre-war was Rs 1 per 10 lbs, in August 1942 Rs 2 per 10 lbs and in February 1944 Rs 10 per 10 lbs, i.e. about l/6d per lb. No esti mate is available of the total annual catch at Kuweit. The chief reason for the greatly incieased price of fish at Kuweit seems to be that there is a real shoitage because other forms of maritime activity are more attractive. In the summer about 100 boats with larg»e crews go off to the Persian Gulf pearl fishery which lasts throughout those months when the ST Monsoon prevents long distance dhow traffic in the Indian Ocean. Then in winter the Kuweit dhows set off with their cargoes ol Basra dates for Karachi, Bombay and beyond. The pre-war back cargo of rice is now replaced by whatever India will release and the dhow masters think they can sell, together with the whole of Kuweit’s Indian quotas which otherwise would have to be carried*by steamship. Partly on' account of Kuweit’s position close to the Iraq and Iran markets, ^the dhow trade of Kuweit has flourished during the war. This is in especial contrast with the serious wartime disruption ^f the dhow trade / ...the dhow trade of southern Arabia. In one war year in fact Kuweit dhows brought m enough Indian timber to build mere dhows than in a normal pre-war year. taken at Kuweit for local use are caught mostly m the summer it is said. The species seen on sale were mostly Qooh+r! £ h' 6 macke £ &lt; r ;L -'! : ’'tna group. The large traps (see Note III) dffh; fflain fl ? kln 6 method;. The island of Failaka, a part o. the Sheikhdom, provides a large proportion of the fish. Prawns are taken in large numbers in the winter by a local method of trawl- mg using twr vessels sailing as a pair. q A .

Coir rope is available .in plenty. C NOTE XII .

However, during Jf J months ending June 1944 BAPCO (i.e. Bahrein Petroleum Co), ■ ught Il6,b66 lbs of fish and 4,346|- lbs of prawns for the use of tneir staf, and families. This amounts to roughly 50 tons of sea- food m the year. BhPCO's aim at present is 600 lbs of fresh fish per day for roughly 7 00 staff plus 100 wives and children, and any r ef^ciency has to be made good in tinned fish.

FISH OIL AS A SOURCE OF VITAMINS A &amp; D FOR AIOC LABOUR. F i sh b0( iy and liver oils are often rich in vitamins A &amp; D. though to greatly varying extents with different species of fish The unacceptability of shark products for AIOC labour has been re ferred to elsewhere. The fish oil already available in great quan tity is sardine body oil, extracted by crude means along the south coast of Arabia. Large quantities o.f this oil are available and enter the Indian ocean and Persian Gulf dhow trades. The normal use for the oil is as a preservative for the woodwork of all classes o/ boat. It is on sale in Abadan. It is probable that as a result of tne crude method of manufacture the whole vitamin content has been lost. However AICCare recommended to test the trade sardine oil ^ m case useful quantities of vitamins'A &amp; P still remain. . A few years ago the Government of Aden, as a demonstration lor the improved extraction of sardine oil, arranged for a simrle boiler and press to be set up at Mukalla. When well tended, this small plant produced a much superior oil. Samples of this oil were filtered^through charcoal and used medicinally with success, it is stated, instead of cod liver oil in the Government hospital at Aden, *. 0T a variety of reasons the simple plant at Mukalla is not at present m igkt be possible for the Government of Aden, on request bp AILC, to arrange for it to be put in operation for a short time to produce^ good quality sardine oil for Abadan. As a first step it is suggested that AIOC should ask the government Health Department, Aden, for a report on the sardine oil with special reference to its vitamin content. . AIGC might also enquire irom the Persian Government whether sardine oil could be prepared in moderate quantities at the Government . nsn factory at Bundar Abbas. There, it is understood, sardines in wmter season are being caught, unless fishing is restricted, in arger quantities than the factory can handle on account of shortage of tinplate, olive oil etc. NOTE XIV . ISINGLASS. It is interesting to note that the species of fish, locally termed ohamahi”^at Abadan, is a source of isinglass. On gutting the tish, each of which weighs about 25 lbs, the fishermen take the air- bladders and carefully dry them. The eventual destination, it is said, used to be Jaran. while now they go to India. 0 NOTE XV . THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT FISH FACTORY AT BUNDAR ABBAS.

I1TTRODUCTION. t Some months ago, Mohamed Bey Radi, Director of Agriculture (Ministry of Economics) had suggested to M.E.S.C. that I should pay a visit to Iraq, and give some advice on fishery problems. An extended visit has so far not been pos sible, but on my way back from the Perisan Gulf, I spent a few days in Bagdad in early August to discuss fishery matters. I was asked to write an opinion, based on what I learnt, but it must be understood that in the circumstances it can only be tentative and deal with generalities. I am most grateful to Mohamed Bey Radi for the fa cilities extended to me during my short visit and to M.Dimi try Belayed, who gave me so much information. GENERAL . Iraq’s fisheries do not present a happy picture. The outstanding feature is lack of understanding with consequent inaction. Doubtless this is partly a reflection of the fact that Iraq is a country rich in food and with a population which is small in proportion to the cultivable area avail able. The fisheries of the inland waterways have, in conse quence, not yet come to be regarded as a national asset worthy of special attention and care. Fisheries at the present stage are chiefly regarded as the convenient source for a mo derate revenue, by means of a Government tax on the first sale of all fish. Partly as a result of this system of taxation and the desire to avoid it, and partly because of the general lack of central interest in fisheries, no helpful statistics are available of the total catch. In consequence, no‘one can produce figures to show the value of the fisheries from the point of view of food supplies. It is said that even 20,000 tons of fish per year may be sold in the larger towns. The actual tax collected suggests on the other hand a catch not exceeding 5,000 tons per year. It must be realised, however, thqt with such a scattered fishery every very many miles of waterways, the collection of adequate statistics will inevi tably long remain a task of great difficulty. The total of fish available) io reputed to have fallen seriously in recent years. The most important fish in Iraq’s river fisheries are several species of Barbus (Cyprinidae) and a migratory Clupeid (Hilsa ilisha). The lack of real Government appreciation of fishery matters is also shown in the fact that these are spread over several Ministries. This is both a cause and an effect of lack/....2.-3- 57 '0 fish movements raid hah its to some extent. But this docs not afford a reason for neglecting the needs and good management of the fish stocks in the public interest. a, Hindiya Barrage , This Barrage is on the Euphrates at a point which is about Li-5 miles in a line due South from Baghdad. This appears to be a case where the migratory fish of the Euphrates are subjected to unnecessarily difficult condi tions and -dangers. Ho fish pass is provided so that one of the twice-yearly migrations of the fish is seriously hindered. A variety of species is concerned. The water regime too is such that there are periods .when great quantities of fish become con centrated in shallow water just downstream of the barrage. There they are subject to an extraoridinarily intense fishery. A /^rule, made entirely for the protection,, not of the fish, but of the barrage, provides a prohibited area immediately downstream of the barrage into which no person should enter. Were this rule properl 3 r enforced it would still not provide adequate pro tection for the fish stocks in their unnaturally concentrated condition. It would seem that action should be taken under throe heads. M) A fish pass should be provided, ( 2 ) The prohibited zone should be enlarged, (3; Pishing within the prohibited zone should be actively prevented. At present, the high price and desirability of fish and the susceptibility of watchmen militate against real prohibition, M. Belayew has put forward plans to deal with those several needs. b. Kut Barrage . The Kut barrage is on the Tigris about halfway between Baghdad and Basra. Here a fish pass or ladder has been pro vided, but in practice it seems that the lower entrance lies in a position, relative to the outfall water, such that a v^ry small proportion of the migratory fish actually make use of it. M.Belayew has put forward plans for tho experimental modifi cation of the pass to meet the needs of the fish. It seems clear that experiments should bo carried out until an entirely satisfacofcy permanent fish ladder can be installed in the light of the experience gained. c. Bohr el Mclh. Tho relative importance of this problem seems to be far •loss than the two described above. The Habbanya Lake is used to take some of the Euphrates flood water and it affords a use ful fishery. Where necessary, the top of the flood is passed on some kilometres further south by an artificial channel into the Bahr cl Melh, a salt-filled depression. When this occurs large numbers'of fish are swept down the channel and meet their doom in the/ 4.

It is understood that there is a desire for some hind Government project, a Fishery Development Co,, to engage in orav/ling at the mouth of the Shatt el Arab and the head of the Persian Guli, Under present conditions, no strong ce.sc could be made out for importing a fully equipped trawler, which should ijosg be fitted with refrigerating machinery from abroad. How ever, the project would seem well worth further investigation and development after the war, in order to provide Basra and Baghdad with regular supplies of good quadity sea. fish. The regular export, of fish is also envisaged to Pales tine-and elsewhere. Such export has taken place in the past, in ice by lorry across the desert. It rose'to a peak at the rate of 700 tons per year in 1941, but then ceased as a result of. wartime restrictions. Since then, there has been a spas modic export of catfish (' f Djiiu?i if ) which, being classes ; calcloss Catfish troops, uot acceptable to the Moslems and Jews of Ii rag are particularly suitable for the feeding of British etc. on account of the absence of bones. • The appearance of a Govt.-controlled or assisted Fishery Development Co. in Iraq seems an excellent plan, and likely to stimulate read interest in the country’s fishorie It is that interest is so necessary. coupled.with constructive action, which y\IP'nHpRpppP^BH © INDIA OFFICE RECORDS MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001bf_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/368</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001bf</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/368</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 9/23 I Fishing schemes in Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-03T09:44:52</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (28 folios)</extent><extent>The file contains two letters, with earlier documents attached in no particular order.
