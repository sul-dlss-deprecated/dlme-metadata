There was the risk of detention by hostile factions of the tribe, which would be involved by my assumption of the character of a mere traveller charged with no mission from my Govern, ment hkely to benefit the tribe, and which would require^ that yerv sufficient hostages should be given, and there were tlm ordinary risks of tiavelling in a country overrun with plundering bands of tribes at constant feud with each other, which at best could only be minimised. evertheless, I considered the chances of success sufficient to justify the attempt being made, and hoped that my journey, which I was assured was cordially approved by the Persian Government, would tend to attract the Turkomans decisively to a Persian connection U t Tnlvf ied {°V UGCeSS ° n the inflllence ^ich we still have with the Tuikoman tribes, on my personal acquaintance with some of the leadino* Tuikomans T\hich would be invaluable in my first communications ^S'u£^ ^ ^ lf ^ thG ^ assistance, of the^ T ^ G 0 ^ I *y ri ? NS WITH the Mebve Turkomans.— On the 21st of March I arrived at Mashad, and found a Turkoman deputation still awaitin» final orders from Teheran They were to be advanced a sum of money' which was not readily forthcoming. ^ &gt; They agreed to assist me, and believed that the tribe would be willmg to receive me but declared that they had been so Ion- absent w at , th ? y C0Ukl , not , aus ,'; er for them. They deplored the death of )ushid Khan, which had left the tribe divided on the question of the succession to the Chiefship, and distracted between at least three separate interests. One party was for union with Persia, another for some political connection with Bokhara, and a third was averse independence. 0 ^ 81Tail * ement that ‘Wened to put limits on their I ultimately concluded to accompany the deputation to Sarakhs and to await there the decision of the tribe. ’ aua it Wl 2 °f h Apri ! 1 Ie f 5Ias,jad accompanied by the British Agent at Mashad, who was to return with my hostages, and joining e* 2884. I. 690. X °2 the Khan of Jam, who was carrying on the Persian negotiations with the Merve Chiefs, arrived on the 2nd of May at Sarakhs. The deputation had, up to this date, received no unfavourable news from Merve. I had constant opportunities on the road of learning their real disposition, and found that they and their party were fully inclined to a Persian connection, but had some doubts as to their power to induce the tribe to come to any unanimous decision. My own journey they found it difficult to understand from their point of view of our relations with Persia. If I had come to them two years before, they said, when Shere Ali was on good terms with Yakub, and an English alliance was possible, I should have found no difficulty, for the whole tribe was willing to follow the advice of Koushid Khan, and he was for admitting English Officers and the English flag. Now we had receded from them and appeared out of reach, and nothing was left, them hut a choice between submission to Russia and a connection with the Persians, whom they distrusted and disliked. My appearance, in evident concert with the Persian authorities, was a new combination which satisfied the deputation, hut which they said would be difficult to brin g to the comprehension of their untravelled fellow tribesmen. On the 4th and 5th of May news came of serious disturbances at Merve, and on the morning of the 7th, shortly after some members of the deputation had left me, their caravan was attacked by a plundering party of the hostile faction. A desultory fight was carried on for some hours within range of my rifles, hut the assailants were ultimately beaten off and the caravan continued its journey. From that time till the middle of June I remained at Sarakhs, re ceiving news frequently, and corresponding both with my friends and the leaders of the hostile faction. I was also visited frequently by parties from Merve. The tribe was far more disorganized than the deputation had supposed, for Nur Virdi Khan, the chief of the Akhal had, came over from the Atak to push forward his claim to the Chiefship in opposition to Baba Khan, the son of the deceased chief Koushid Khan. The subject of my visit was discussed at several meetings of the elders cf the tribe, and 'was very favourably received, especially by the “ Ishans ’’—the priests of the tribe, and I should, without doubt, even in the disordered state of the tribe, have had no difficulty in carrying out mv instructions at once, if Persia had not also been in the field, and my own friends in the tribe in a manner committed to her. It appeared, as' the most intelligent members of the deputation had feared, impossible to explain to the tribe my position as a Persian guest. The majority, including the priests, would only regard me as an English agent bent secretly on promoting an alliance with Afghanistan, and were from their dislike to Persia and the Shiah sect disposed to receive me, hut the more influential party with whom only I had at first been able to communicate were, while inclined to favour me, committed to Persia, from whom they hoped to obtain not only protection, but also access to the pastures of the Tejjen and the Kelat Atak. It thus became clear both to me and to the Persian Agent that our interests were directly opposed, and that either one or the other must leave the field open. It was useless, as the Agent expressed it, for any man, referring to the Chief of the deputation, to attempt to take up t’wo melons in one hand. Up to this point I had had no cause to complain of the attitude of the local Government or of my companion. My movements had been so rapid that the Russian Minister at Teheran had not had time to exercise any counter influence, and his Consular Agent deputed to Mashad had not yet left the Caspian coast. But I now found that adverse influences were at work at Merve with the members of the deputation most committed to me, and I learnt later that letters had3 been sent without my knowledge to the Merve Chiefs by the Persian Agent. His intrigues had not, however, any practical effect in diverting the Turkomans from their engagement to receive me, for it became e y er *f day clearer to me that it was impossible, in the disorganized state of the tribe, for them to arrive within any definite time at a decision, or to give sufficient hostages both to myself and to him, and it was impossible for me to wait indefinitely. I felt bound also to take into consideration the importance of the success of the X ersian negotiations, which my withdrawal would cer tainly to some extent facilitate. Hie establishment of even a nominal protectorate over Merve by Persia appeared to be the only practicable alternative to a Russian occupation, and an alternative not ^ only prac ticable but advantageous, as being more likely to commit Persia to a policy of resistance to Russian aggression than any other conceivable, and as certain to gain a few years of valuable time. I was also bound by a promise given by Her Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government to do nothing prejudicial to Persian interests. On the 15th of June, matters having in no way improved, I left Sarakhs to return to the Persian border, leaving behind me the Persian Agent, who remained for some months longer, and ultimately returned without having brought the Turkomans to any agreement. I attribute his failure to the effect produced on the Turkomans by the attitude of the Persian Government in regard to the Russian invasion of the Akhal, which showed them clearly the measure of assistance and protection they might expect. My last letters to the Merve “ Aksakals ” informed them that, the season being far advanced, and their own affairs still unsettled, I con sidered it advisable to return to Mashad and await there news from them of the settlement of the succession to the Chief ship. On the 20th of June I arrived at Mashad, and from that date to the end of July continued to communicate by messengers vrith Merve. Definite offers of hostages were made to me by the Sichmaz clan, but I considered it miadvisable to treat with any one party, at a time when dissensions had reached the verge of civil war. Shortly after my return to Mashad the Russian Consul and his com panions arrived, and severe pressure was being placed, I found, on the local authorities from Teheran. The Prince, a brother of the Shah, who was governing Ixhorassan, was entirely under the control of the Minister charged with the Government of Khorassan, and of his brother, who had taken his place during his absence in Europe, and w r as notoriously a Russian partisan, and I soon found that even the measure of support that I had derived from the personal good will of the Prince Governor was wanting, and that my letters were secretly intercepted, and my messengers arrested on various pretexts. During August and September I was able to keep myself informed of the state of affairs in the oasis, but avoided direct communication, as I had no object to gain, and thought it advisable to give no colour to the accusations that would certainly be made that I was inciting the Merve Turkomans to aid the Akhal in opposing the Russian advance. Some such accusations have, I have since learnt, been made, and may have been based on the reports of the Russian Consul Bakouline.f; I would therefore take this opportunity of stating that he must have been well aware that there was no ground for them. In default of clear instructions, I had been most careful throughout to avoid doing any thing that would give just cause of complaint to the Russian Com mander on the Atrck, or incite the Turkomans to a resistance that must prove useless, and, without any compensating advantage, would entail distinct loss of prestige on the Government employing me. Whatever may be the issue of the present campaign in the Atak^ and it is hardly doubtful, it will, I believe, be clearly understood on the Khorassan border that the credit of the English Government is in no wav directlv involved.* 4 Towards the end of September I made a tour in the Kelat Atak, and while there received fresh communications from Merve. To judge from the letters I received and the reports brought over, all the principal Aksakals had come to the conclusion that, in default of Persian protec tion, the value of which they had seen, there was no course open to them but to attempt to obtain some assistance from India. Exaggerated reports of war preparations there had by this time reached Khorassan from Seistan, auxl were carried off into the desert by Turkomans from Mashad. Having learnt at the same time of the retreat of General Lomakin from his advanced position on the Akhal border, it appeared to me that a suitable opportunity for the prosecution of my journey to the oasis was offered. In many other respects my position in the Atak was favourable to the project. Owing to the friendship of the Khan of Kelat, who was with me on my tour, I was able to communicate with Merve rapidly and freely, and I was promised by him all the assistance in his power. The great heat of summer too had passed, and the route from Kelat was as easy as the high road by Sarakhs. The internal dissensions also, which had made any dealings with the tribe before so difficult, had much subsided, through fear of a Russian incursion from the Oxus, and the necessity of uniting for the repair of the great irrigation dam, on which the cultivation of the oasis is to a great extent dependent. I therefore sent messengers to Merve with a favourable reply to the invitation of the Aksakals, and had made every preparation for my journey, when I received final instructions to return from Khorassan. The Russian Consul’s communication with Merve was limited to interviews with a few of the Turkomans who were brought to him by a Khivan Turkoman in Russian pay, and his object appears to have been simply to obtain information of the nature of my-dealings with the tribe. It was currently reported that I was arranging for the supply of arms to the Turkomans through Afghanistan, and was inciting them to send aid to the Akhal, and to attack the Russian detachments on the Oxus, but he must have been thoroughly well aware that there was no ground for such reports, for the Turkomans who went to him, and received presents, always came subsequently to me, with the same view, and I was able to ascertain from them the nature of the information they had imparted. Negotiations with the Akhal Turkomans.— In my projected journey through the Atak or Akhal Turkoman country, I was con fronted with few of the difficulties that compelled so much caution in my dealings with Merve. The country was easy, and safe to enter, and I could command almost absolute security when there, while the elders of the tribe were unanimous in their desire to receive me. No obstructive measures that the Persian Government was prepared to take could have prevented my going to the tribe and remaining in safety with them, if insuperable political objections had not arisen. At the time of my deputation, in March 1878, the east coast of the Caspian was denuded of troops, Russia appeared for a time incapable of any fresh aggressive efforts, and she had never made any absolute claim to the possession of the Atak. She w^as not, in fact, in the field, and it seemed possible to make a successful and politically unobjection able, if not advantageous, journey. By the time of my arrival on the border (May) this aspect of affairs had, however, changed, and Russian troops were again collecting for an invasion of the “Atak.” The conditions under which I had undertaken the duty entrusted to me thus no longer existed. My instructions did not contemplate or provide for any such change, and it w T ould have been easy to proceed on my journey without regard to contingent political effects, the results of which, however mischievous,5 would be very obscure, but I felt that I was alone in a position to judge fairly ot the effects of my movements, and could not absolve myself of responsibility. Before continuing my report of my proceedings, I will describe briefly the relations that subsisted between the Akhal and the Persian (jovernment at the time of my arrival on the border. Since the closing of the slave marts in Turkestan, the tribe has been anxious to exchange an unprofitable and precarious independence for ic protection of Persia, and has in consequence been comparatively united and easy to deal with. They have the same hatred to Persia shown by all the Turkoman tribes on her border, but their settlements being exposed to the constant attacks of the Kurd borderers, and to in vasion by an open road from the Caspian, they have been compelled to turn to her, and might by this time, if the border Chiefs had been restrained m their hostility, and the action of the Government unfettered y tii^sia, have been as peaceable subjects of Persia as their neigh bours the Goklan. ° this great change in the disposition of the tribe came to me as a new light, when I first met some of the elders at Kuchan in the autumn of * 0r ^ was regarded in Khorassan as inveterately hostile, and still reported to be so by the border Chiefs. I had several interviews witli these eldeis, and learnt from them that raiding into Persia had entirely ceased, save in the false reports of the border Chiefs, a state ment afterwards fully corroborated, and that the complaints of the Russians against them were mere pretexts, based on their assumption of authority over the Yamuts, with whom the Atak people were in con stant warfare, suffering at least as much loss as they indicted. I have since learnt that the charges brought by the Russians against them within the last five years amount to four in number,—one an attack on a column operating against Khiva, an act of open warfare that requires no justification, whether the tribe be viewed as independent, and acting in defence of its independence, or as subjects of Khiva, as the Russians themselves allege. Of the other three instances, one was an attack on Yamuts paying tribute to Russia, who had previously attacked the Akhal settlements; and two were plundering attacks on caravans* which, even if fairly proved against them, would not make up a very heavy count, in view of the provocation given them by Markosof on his. way to Khiva. Nothing, however, has since shown me more clearly the true disposi tion of the tribe than the fact that the local obstacles to pacification arose entirely on the Persian side of the border. When asked by the elders to obtain for them the protection of the English Government, and to advise them, I made it clear they could not. depend on obtaining any help from Afghanistan or India, and suggested that their only way out of their present troubles was to submit to Persia, and gain what measure of protection she could give them fron* Russia and their border enemies. A year later, in the summer of 1876, Abul Hassan Khan, the Chief of Kuchan, invited a large gathering of the tribe, and they came freely into Persian territory, tendering their submission to the Shah, and sending a deputation to Teheran. The deputation returned accompanied by some of the Shah’s officers, charged to draw up a compact with the Turkoman elders, and these officers were still in the Atak when I found mvself again on the border in Pebruary 1877. The Shah’s Ministers were then apparently still in earnest in the matter, but the Turkomans assured me that there was no hope of a successful issue so long as the negotiations were left practically in the hands of the border Chief by the deputation from Teheran of subordinate officers open to corrupt influences. This state of affairs I reported through Her Majesty’s Minister in 2884. b6 Persia, and I gathered that the submission of tha Akhal people to Persia, and the extension of her actual or nominal sovereignty to its ancient limits on the verge of the Khivan desert, would not be un favourably regarded by Her Majesty’s Government. But, in the mean time, the Russian authorities in the Caucasus, aware of the negotiations in progress, and fully alive to the disadvantages of any peaceful settlement of the question, organized an expedition which reached Beurma in the Atak, and gave a serious blow to the hopes that the Turkomans had formed of protection from. Persia. While thus entering a very decisive protest against a settlement likely to interfere with their ulterior designs, the authorities in the Caucasus would appear to have been unprepared to push Persia to extremities by urging any territorial claims, or putting a stop to the negotiations. These were continued with eagerness and in good faith on the part of the Turkomans, but the ultimate purpose of Russia was, no doubt, perceived by or made known to the Persian Minister who had originated the negotiations, and, hopeless of support and of success, he gave way to the pressure of the border Chiefs, and allowed them to resume open hostilities, making but feeble protests, and insincere en deavours to compensate the plundered Turkomans for their losses. In spite of such discouragements, however, the Akhal elders, who attributed the return of the Russians from Beurma to the intervention of Persia, continued to hope and to restrain in a surprising manner the more turbulent spirits in the “ obabs,” and at the time of my arrival at Mashad, in the spring of last year, I found a number of them patiently awaiting satisfaction from the local Government for the plunder of one of their caravans by the Kurds. The action of the Shah’s officers, even at that late date, was incom patible with the disclaimer of any interest in, or sovereign rights over, the tribe, which I shortly afterwards learnt had been made by his Ministers. On my arrival at Mashad, in April (1878), I saw the Akhal deputation above mentioned, and Abul Hassan Khan, of Kuchan, with whom they were staying, and was assured by them of the pacific disposition of the tribe. They were then prepared to make any sacrifice to escape an nexation by Russia, and would have accepted any terms imposed on them. They invited me to visit them, and attached a most exaggerated importance to my doing so, believing, in fact, that the limits of my journey would be also the limits of any Russian advance in their direction. I promised to visit them after my return from Merve, taking occasion to explain carefully that my doing so could have none but the * most remote influence on their fortunes, and advising them to continue to hold their hands, giving no good grounds of offence to Russia. There was then still no talk of any Russian expedition from the “Caspian. Prom that time till the 5th of May, when I received definite news of the collection of a Russian force for an attack on the Akhal, I had no communication with the tribe. I was then at Sarakhs, and sent off a messenger with letters to the elders, asking for information, and with orders to bring me back an accurate account of the disposition and intentions of the tribe. After many consultations with the Merve elders who were then with me, I came to the conclusion that a journey through the Atak for the purposes for which I had been deputed, at a time when invasion was impending, and the tribe in full preparation to meet it, would be un- advisable, and could at best only be attended with limited success. It would be impossible for me, I saw, at such a time to divest myself of my official character, and any attempt to do so would be likely to arouse the suspicions of the ignorant tribesmen, very few of whom7 really understood my position, and might lead to serious diffieulties. If, on the other hand, I allowed myself to be recognized as an official agent of the English Government, I should necessarily, in some degree, influence the disposition of the tribe in a sense hostile to Russia, the effect of which would he to incite and stimulate a resistance that could not ultimately be successful, and might lead to a repetition of the scenes of massacre that marked the Russian expedition of 1875 against the Khivan Yamuts. My presence with the tribe, even if I had left them before any actual collision with the Russians, would have so closely connected the name of the Government, I was serving with its fortunes, that such a result could not fail to damage seriously the reputation of England in Khorassan, and even beyond the limits of the province. That this was not a mere vague anticipation of results that, in view' of the comparative obscurity that would cover my movements, I could afford to disregard, was made clear to me by the unanimous expression of opinion of all the natives with w r hom I conversed. There was no doubt at all in their minds that, if I appeared in the Atak at such a time, it should be with the intention of seeing the tribe through its im pending difficulties. No other purpose w r ould in any case be believed in, and success or failure w’ould have a wide influence on the future politics of the Steppes. My relations with the tribe and knowledge of its condition suggested an alternative which appeared to offer a fair chance of success, and of a decisive political advantage, wdiile failure w r ould not entail necessarily any loss of prestige. My proposal, which I submitted in the first place by telegraph, and subsequently in a letter dated 5th May (1878) from Sarakhs, was briefly to endeavour to utilize the still existing political status of the Akhal people as Persian subjects in raising a barrier to the immediate annexa tion of the Atak by Russia. I proposed to go at once to the Atak with Nur Virdi Khan, the Akhal Chief, wdio w r as then at Merve, and by means of the elders of the tribe, who were, I knew, in favour of complete submission to Persia, to induce them to send a deputation to the Russian camp claiming exemption from attack on the ground of their being Persian subjects. The tribe w r ould, I hoped, in the meantime, while prevented by the elders from attacking the Russian camp or convoys, and so giving them a fair pretext for advancing, have moved their families and cattle into the glens of the Atak chain, where they wmuld be safe from Cossack forays, and well within the recognized limits of Persia. I v'as then, as I have said above, under the impression that the submission of the Akhal tribe to Persia was a solution of this frontier question, not unfavourably regarded by Her Majesty’s Govern ment. The first, and it seemed the most serious, difficulty would be with the tribe itself. It would be no easy task, I feared, to induce the warlike tribesmen to hold their hands when threatened with invasion, and appear to treat with the enemy before they were attacked, but I was assured of the pacific determination of the elders, and my Turkoman advisers considered that success was quite possible, and would go far towards bringing the Merve people also to a definite determination. A second difficulty appeared in the doubt as to what course of action the Persian Government would pursue. The Shah had accepted the allegiance of the tribe, and had given them a “ firman,” but it would be necessary that he should go further and support their representations, and give them an asylum secure from the attacks of his Kurd subjects. If the diplomatic difficulties could be overcome, the latter would, I knew, be easily secured, for the border Chiefs were even more averse to the Russian intrusion into the Atak than to a pacification by their own Government. •I was not myself in a position to judge of the state of our relations with Persia, or the relative extent of our influence. The facts before me were that the Shah had shown a decided wish to extend his pro tection to the Akhal, and to include their settlements in his frontier, and that my journey had been, I was assured, cordially approved by his Ministers, and had up to that time been facilitated loyally by the pro vincial Government. It‘wasafair inference that any plan offering a chance of securing his frontier would be readily considered. While on my side unable to forecast the action of the Persian Govern ment, I knew that neither Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran nor the Persian officials could be so well aware as myself of the real temper of the Akhal tribe, or of the possibility of preventing them from attacking the Russian camp, and thereby giving the Russian com mander justification for an advance into the Atak. Thirdly, the probable action of the Russian authorities was to be con sidered, and it seemed unlikely that General Lomakin would be per mitted to pursue the Turkomans into Persian territory, at a time when every effort was being made to secure the good w r ill and co-operation of Persia. The object, too, of the expeditions against the Akhal had hitherto always been punitive, and the purpose of the Russian Government declaredly the pacification of the Steppe, while the political advantage to Russia of the possession of such a line of communica tion w r ith Afghanistan had not been brought into such prominence as now. It appeared, therefore, possible that the ambition of subordinate authorities might be restrained in view of more important issues in Europe, and the pacific solution that offered itself be accepted. That the designs of Russia w r ould be materially facilitated by any restraint put upon the tribe or its turbulent elements w r as not possible, in view r of the feeble powder of combination and resistance of the Turko man nomads. If Russia w r ere determined at all costs to possess herself of the Atak. nothing within their power to achieve would arrest her progress. This could, it seemed clear to me, only be effected by some arrangement that should satisfy all her just grounds of complaint, and while thus throwing the responsibility of hostilities on her, and un masking her intentions, raise prospective difficulties so serious as to compel a cautious policy. On the 18th of June I returned to Mashad from Sarakhs, Laving in the meantime learnt that the Russian force was still on the coast. It seemed possible that the idea of an expedition had been abandoned or deferred, pending a settlement of affairs in Europe, and I determined, therefore, wdiile awaiting further news or the receipt of fresh instructions, to continue my preparations for a journey through the Atak. I found the Governor of the province still professedly willing to give me every assistance in his pow T er, and he assured me that no objection had yet been raised to my journey at Teheran, and that my project w T as very favourably viewed, but he subsequently gave me to understand that much opposition was being made by the Russian Minister, and that he was no longer as free to act as before. As it seemed to me unadvisable to attempt to cross the border without the open and full concurrence of the Persian Government, I reminded him that I had set out with the consent of the authorities at Teheran, and their pledge of assistance, and that, until this was formally with drawn, I should continue to expect all the help he could give me. I w r as well acquainted with the border Chiefs personally, and knew their deep-rooted objection to anything likely to affect their position as intermediaries between their Government and the Turkomans, and I had before me the experiences of Captain Butler, who had lately been among them, to show me to what lengths they were prepared to go in thwarting a traveller not amply supported by the authorities. It seemed to me necessary, in view of the ill usage met with by that Officer, to vindicatei;o 9 in the fullest manner the position of a British Officer in the eyes of the people on both sides of the border. As regards the Turkomans, it was absolutely necessary that I should be able to show that I could command the aid and respect of the Persian authorities. On any other terms I should be incurring additional obligations, which I knew I had not the means of repaying. They would, as I aftewards found, have been still anxious to receive me, but on the faith of assistance in their difficulties that I should not have been in a position to give. With this object in view, therefore, I asked for the appointment of a Persian officer to accompany me on my tour, and proposed to the Prince Governor to send Abul Hassan Khan, who was a personal friend of mine, the son of a border Chief, and connected with the Akhal Turko mans by marriage. His appointment would have so far secured the success of my journey, and would have given it such great political importance in the eyes of the people along the whole line of frontier, and would have gone so far towards completing the pacification of the Atak, that I knew great opposition would be offered to it by the Itussian faction at Teheran, and that nothing but the sanction of the Shah, who was then in Europe, and to whom I suggested a reference, would decide the question in my favour. It was ultimately decided against me by the brother of the Eoreign Minister, who was notoriously a Itussian partisan. Prom that time it was clear to the local Government that Itussian influence was in the ascendant at the capital, and I could count on gaining no point that was likely to be contested by the Itussian Minister. A nominal concession was made in the appointment of a brother of one of the border Chiefs to accompany me, but he from the outset declared that he could not cross the border, and acted always under compulsion. Notwithstanding this discouragement, so long as the intentions of the Itussian authorities remained uncertain, there was room to hope that I might turn my presence on the border to good account. The delay in advancing from the coast, and the secrecy maintained regarding their designs by the Russians, seemed to indicate that their plans were still undeveloped, and were dependent on the turn affairs would take in Europe. There the political situation seemed to be favourable to any pacific arrangement. Peace was about to be secured at Berlin, and the Shah was actually in England, or expected there. I had still no knowledge of the state of our relations with the Shah’s Government, but it was reasonable to suppose, under the circumstances, that both Russia and Persia might be willing to accept a solution of a long standing frontier difficulty that neither could object to, save in view of a common policy of aggression. The difficulty that would certainly be made a serious ground of objection would be that of pacifying the Turkomans without a cam paign. It might, even at a distance, appear insuperable. But I found that the delay in the Russian advance had in no way increased the warlike spirit of the tribe. I had excellent information through the Kuchan borderers, and knew that the elders still looked to an asylum in Persia, maintained their full influence, and might be depended upon to keep to any engagements made for them. On the 19th of July, therefore, I submitted a suggestion for the appointment of Persian officers (or of myself in conjunction with one of the border Chiefs) to be commissioned to visit the Atak, with the object of restraining the tribe from attacking any of the Russian camps, and paving the way to a settlement of the complaints against them. My own presence, though useful in conveying to the Turkomans a pledge of the sincerity of the Persian Government, would not be indispensable, 2884. CMan 10 and would certainly be objected to by the Hussian authorities, and pos sibly by the Persians. Such a proposal involved, of course, a good understanding with Persia, which, though it did not appear to exist, did not seem impossible, and I based whatever hopes I entertained of success on the chance of its serving as a timely suggestion of a means of overcoming a difficulty that would certainly be regarded or represented as insuperable. In the meantime I had completed my preparations for the journey, intending to be guided, subject to instructions, by such information as reached me of the nature of the Russian designs. If it should appear that there was no intention to occupy the Atak, my visit to the tribe might be unobjectionable on political grounds, while on the other hand any certainty that they would ultimately become Russian subjects would render it unadvisable. On the 21st of July I marched from Mashad, and the next day I received intelligence which left me no room to doubt that the Russians intended to occupy the Atak, and that the Persian Government was prepared to assist them. At the same time came news that a force was already marching up the Atrak, and would enter the Atak before I could possibly complete my journey. I therefore halted, and telegraphed to Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, communicating the intelligence I had received, and asking for in structions as to my further movements. During my halt I learned that the Khans along the border as far as Kelat-i-Nadiri had been ordered to comply with the Russian General’s requisitions for carriage and supplies, which indicated designs beyond a mere occupation of the Akhal Atak, and that the force, though col lected at Chekislar, had not yet begun its march. It did not, in fapt, leave till nearly three wrecks later. On the 2Gth July I recehed in structions not to enter the Atak if the invasion had begun, and on the 1st August, having in the meantime received letters of invitation from the elders, and learnt that the country was as yet undisturbed, I con tinued my march. I proposed to communicate directly with the tribe, but not to cross the border, unless I found that they were likely to remain undisturbed, and entertained no extravagant expectations from me. On the border of the Deregez Chiefship, I was met by the men I had sent to Akhal, who informed me that they had been very w^ell received there, and that representatives from the tribe had come back with them to Deregez, where they had been threatened and turned back by force across the border by order of the Khan. A letter which subsequently came into my hand showed me that the Khan had his instructions from the Governor of the province, who was without doubt acting under orders from Teheran. I proceeded to Deregez, and there found that the Khan was prepared to place every possible obstacle in the way of my further progress. This was, however, no more than I expected, and was only inconvenient as preventing me from communicating readily with the Turkomans, Leaving Deregez, I continued my journey in the direction of Genk Tapa, about 80 miles north-east, where the Akhal elders were gathered. A few days later on, the 20th August, the first reliable news of the advance of the Russian force, and of the intention of the tribe to dis pute their passage, was brought to me. On the 26th August I returned to Mashad, where I found instructions for me to communicate no further with the Akhal. All hope of pre venting a collision was then at an end, for the Russian General was committed to his task, and the Turkomans had no course left but to oppose him or submit. ' Oa the 7th of September reports, which I subsequently found to be much exaggerated, came in of the attack on the camp at Band-i-Hassan, near Beurma.Touu in Kelat Atak. —From that date till the 26th of the same month I remained at Mashad, and then left for Kelat-i-Nadiri, where I hoped to obtain from the Khan a sufficient guard to enable me to visit the Kelat and Deregez Ataks, which prolong the line of the Akhal Atak to the banks of the Tejjen. I knew little of these tracts except that they had formerly supported a considerable population, and would very soon acquire some political importance in connection with the new line of frontier that Russia appeared determined to occupy. From the 1st to the 12th October I remained in the Kelat Atak, and was then forced to return within the line of settled frontier by a serious outbreak at Deregez, which compelled the Khan to collect all his force for the protection of his villages from the Turkomans, who had been brought in by the rival claimant to the Deregez Chiefship. I found the Atak of Kelat comparatively a very fertile and well watered country, showing abundant evidence of former prosperity. Judging from the extent of the ruins still visible, its population cannot have been less than a quarter of a million, and it is not many years since it supported, together with the Tejjen tract, the whole tribe of Tekeh Turkomans now encamped in the Merve oasis. The tribe was then estimated at 30,000 tents, which would give a population of not less than 150,000. At present a few of the best watered parts only are cultivated by Alieli and Tekkeh settlers, who pay a share of the produce to the Khan, but have still a position so strong and independent that in the event of a Russian occupation of Merve it might easily be constructed into a territorial claim. The Deregez Atak I only reached the verge of at the ruined town of Abiverd, but I obtained sufficient information to know that it is far inferior in value to the Kelat Atak. All its available water is occupied by Persians securely settled in villages, which must eventually be ceded to Russia if she is to connect her Caspian line with Turkestan through Merve. The Khan accompanied me throughout my tour, and I found him, as I have found every intelligent Persian at all free from Court or official influences, thoroughly well disposed, and keenly alive to the dangers that threaten the country from Russian supremacy. Return Journey by Gurgan Pass. —On my return from the Atak I received instructions to proceed to the capital. Sending my baggage by the caravan road, I marched myself, on the 30th October, in the direction of Bujnurd, wishing to utilize my return journey by surveying a road leading from Mashad by the Gurgan valley to the Caspian, which information acquired on previous journeys had led me to suppose would prove a direct and easy line of communication. I proposed also to obtain more accurate information than was possible at Mashad of the real results of the Russian expedition into the Atak, and of the extent to which they had been supplied from Persia. Regarding the question of supplies, I found, and have already reported, that stringent orders were given to the Khan of Bujnurd to send no supplies to the Russian camps, but that he was told, at the same time, that they had permission to purchase from him ; that this permission was not taken advantage of by the Persian villagers was due only to the fact that the advance was not projected far enough forward from its base of supply on the lower Atrak, or sufficiently near to the supplying districts of the Persian border. The main result of the expedition, apart from its wider political effects, was the entire severance of the bonds that had in some degree held the Akhal tribe to Persia, and to leave them confronted with the alternatives of submission to Russia or the relinquishment of tWir corn lands and pastures in the Atak.The passive attitude which I then learnt they had maintained in the face of the force encamped at Band-i-Hassan showed how thoroughly they were controlled by their elders, and how easily they might have been brought to a pacific arrangement that would have been welcomed by Persia, and could hardly have been refused by Russia before she was committed to the task of subjugation. The road which I followed from Mashad to the Gurgan plain I found to be an easy line, avoiding everwhere the great mountain chains that appear to bar an advance from the sea, and descending to sea level from the plateau by a singularly easy defile. It is fairly well watered and supplied throughout, and though now disused, owing to the depopula tion of Khorassan, and the diversion of the trade of India, Afghanistan, and Turkestan, which in former times had followed it, the ruins of large caravanserais at every stage remain to attest its importance. It offers facilities for the advance of troops from the Caspian to Herat, too obvious to allow it to remain long neglected. On the 19th November I reached Shahrood, and on the 22nd reported my arrival at Teheran. In concluding this report, I would call attention to the services rendered me by Abul Hassan Khan of Kuchan, the Khan of Kelat-i- Nadir, and the Eelkhani of Bujnurd. Their personal attention to me I have been able to acknowledge, and repay in some degree, but their services to me as a British Officer still remain unacknowledged, and must, I fear, remain so, unless there be'a great chansre in the state of our relations with the Shah’s Government. In view of 'the possibility of such a change I would, however, take this opportunity of pointing them out as sincere well-wishers of the English Government. The services of Abul Hassan Khan demand, I think, especial attention. I was compelled to make use of him, and he suffered and risked much in furthering my projects. Any recognition now of his services would probably injure him, but in view of any future opportunity which may offer itself to Her Majesty’s representative in Persia of showing him kindness, I will, if it be considered desirable, make special record of them. The claims to consideration earned by the excellent service rendered me by my native subordinates will not, I trust, be affected by the ill success of my journey. The services of Hassan Ali Khan, the Shiraz Agent, who accompanied me as Native Secretary, and of Nadir Ali, of the Corps of Guides, have already been brought to the notice of Her Majesty’s Indian Government. Abbas Khan, the Agent at Mashad, who was with me for two months, proved himself a very willing and hard working public servant, and is deserving of official recognition of his services.
