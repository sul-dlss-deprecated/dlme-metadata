Bill, Esq., I.C.S., First Assistant Resident (in the absence of the Resident), To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department telegram No. S.-23I, dated 13th May 1912, I have the honour to forward, for the information of Government, a copy of the communication marginally noted, F rom —R. H. New, Esq., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident, Lingah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to invite a reference to mv Diary No. 18, entry 388, for the week ending 6th May 191Q, regarding the importation of diving apparatus and divers from Bombay for use in these waters. 2. The two air*pumping machines and three diving dresses which arrived on the 21 st April 1912 by the Arab Steamship Company’s S. S. “Bahrein” were shipped by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab, Director of the Arab Steamship Company, to his uncle Abdul Mohsin Mashari, a Bahrein subject residing at Lingah, who is the local manager of the enterprise. The seven divers, lines-men, and pipe-men, who accompanied the diving machines, were engaged by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab in the Arab Steamship Company’s Office in Bombay. 3. Many rumours have lately reached me that all pearling Nakhudas were combining to prevent the use of these new machines and were prepared to use force. On the 17th May I received a visit from Hamad bin Khalifan Busti, the recognised head of Debai pearling Nakhodas, who made a formal protest before me against the introduction of these machines. Busti stated that all pearlers were determined to prevent their use and that he disclaimed all responsibility if anything happened to the people engaged in this enterprise. He further stated that the Trucial Shaikhs were forwarding a petition to the Resident about it. 4. The same day (17th May) I heard that Abdul Mohsin intended to leave the same evening for the pearl banks with the imported divers, who are all British subjects, and who have been registered in this Vice-Consulate. 1 considered it my duty to inform the divers of the risks involved, which was done, and they were finally warned that if they choose to accompany Abdul Mohsin s expedition, the British Government would not be responsible if any harm came to them. After conferring among themselves all the seven divers decided to ask Abdul Mohsin to send them back to Bombay. I understand Abdul Mohsin is reporting the matter to Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab and will wait for his reply before sending the divers back to Bombay. the importation of diving apparatus and divers from Bombay for use in Persian Gulf waters. received from His Majesty’s Vice-Ccnsul and Assistant Resident, Lingah, regarding Enclosure No. 1.

Kincaid, Esq., C.V.O., Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department, To—-The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, In continuation of my telegram, dated the 9th May 1912, I am directed to forward, for disposal by the Government of India, a letter from Muhammad bin Adul Wahab, Mishari, dated the 28th May 1912, relative to certain pearl fishing operations which he desires to undertake at Lingah. Dated Bombay, the 28th May 1912. From— Muhammamd bin Abdul Wahab, Mishari, To—The Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political Department. I beg to lay before you the following representation with the hope that it will meet with your kind consideration. As we know the Persian Gulf and the Oman Seas are open to all for pearl fishing, I have sent to my friend Mr. Abdul Mohsin, Mishari, at Lingah on the ICith April from here, 2 divers, 2 linesmen, 2 pipemen and a cook with some divers’ apparatus such as are used by divers in Australia and Rangoon and other parts. These men have given us a written agreement that they would do the work of diving, etc., on our account. On the 25th instant I received a letter from Mr. Abdul Mohsin, Mishari, saying that he had made all preparations for starting work, but in the meanwhile His Majesty’s British Consul at Lingah sent for Mr. Abdul Mohsin, Mishari, and told him that he would not be allowed to fish for pearls, saying that the rulers of the Oman and Persian Gulf Seas did not give permission to do so. Thereupon Mr. Mishari requested the British Consul to permit him to fish at Bahrain or Katar, to which the Consul was pleased to say that there was much risk to life in these places at the hands of the native inhabitants who would attack and kill our Indian subjects. Mr. Abdul Mohsin, Mishari, then said to His Majesty’s British Consul that he did not think that the Governors of the Oman and the Persian Gulf Seas would raise any objection to our fishing in these seas and he did not know whether the British Consul had instructions to prohibit our fishing. He therefore requested the Consul to write to him officially in the matter. The British Consul declined to give any reply, saying that he would only give a verbal reply and added that if he went for pearl fishing in these seas and if anything went wrong both he and the gentleman that sent him the divers’ apparatus would be held responsible. Under the circumstances I beg to place the matter in your hands and to request you to give necessary instructions to the British Consul at Lingah to allow Mr. Abdul Mohsin to start the work of pearl fishing. In case we are not to be given permission to fish for pearls, I beg you will be kind enough to let us know so that I may call the men back. We have already incurred heavy expenses up to now. We went in for all these expenses as we knew that the Persian Gulf seas were quite open to all for pearl fishing. If we had known that we would not be allowed to fish we would never have sent any men at such a great expense. I therefore, once more, beg you would be pleased to take necessary action in the matter.No. 1304-E. A. (Confidential), dated Simla, the 18th June 1912. From—A. H. Grant, Esq., C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to correspondence ending with Mr. Bill’s letter No. 1037, dated the 26th May 1912, I am directed to forward, for disposal by you and report, a copy of the petition addressed by Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab, Mishari, to the Government of Bombay, together with a copy of the latter’s forwarding letter to the Government of India, No. 4636, dated the 7th June 1912, on the subject of the scientific pearl fishing organized by the petitioner at Lingah. 2. I am to suggest that the petitioner might he informed, as was done in the case of Tikchand Duara {vide our letter No. 1451-E. A., dated 15th July 1902), that since the pearling banks are regarded as the common property of the Arab divers, no Chief can grant a concession to any individual to employ modern diving apparatus in the pearling operations in the Gulf. A fortiori, the Government of India can grant no such permission. In the interests of the peace and order of the littoral the petitioner must therefore abandon his project, which he should not have embarked upon without first ascertaining the facts.No. M.-105, dated Muscat, the 28th May 1912 (received 4th June 1912.) p rom Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, T 0 The Hon’ble Lfeutenant-Colonel Sir A. H. McMahon, G.C V.O., K.C.I E., C.S.l, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, 1 have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India a copy of a letter, with enclosures, which I have received from the Political Agent, Muscat, regarding the enjoyment of pearl fishing rights along the “ French Islands and coast of the Djibouti Colony”. 2 The communication from the Aden Residency would seem to suggest that pearlers from Oman in the habit of frequenting the pearl banks of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea should be notified of this grant to a French merchant of a monopoly for fishing pearls, amber, etc. along the coast of that French Colony. It is not stated whether or not the concession is confined to the three-mile territorial limit, or whether any restriction is imposed as to the method of diving to be employed. It appears to me that having regard to our well recognized policy in res pect of the Persian Gulf pearl fisheries it would be inexpedient for us to give overt recognition to such a concession by becoming the medium of its noti fication in these waters ; and in any case I think it advisable to refer the matter first for the consideration of the Government of India. In view of the bearing of such a monopoly as that contemplated upon the pearl fishing question in these waters, I request the favour of being informed as fully as possible, when convenient to Government, of the precise scope of this monopoly, the attitude or Government towards it and the lines of the reply to be aiven by Political Officers under the Persian Gulf Residency to any complaints that may be received from the Sultan of Muscat or other Arab Rulers in the Gulf who as the result thereof find their subjects debarred from fishing on banks which they have hitherto frequented.
