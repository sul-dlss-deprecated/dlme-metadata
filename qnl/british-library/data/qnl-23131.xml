Dear Colonel Fowle, I faaTe teen considering the question of the dourt of the Indian A-esistant. fhe procedure follov.ed In the oourt ie i'ar iroifl sniisiaotory and in sooie oircuin^— stances illegal, and although it has worked without challenge so far, I think, that the time has come to regularize the situ&amp;tioxu Instead of dealing solely with simple isneducafced persons the Court of the Indian Assistant now has to cater for the semi-educated of India, fhis type of person oftain boasts a knowledge of law and never being satisfied with any decision against them appeal to the bitter end. I am afraid any appeal against a decision in the Indian Assistant’s Court, as at present constituted, would almost certainly succeed outside Bahrain and might load to undesirable newspaper publicity. 2. Please refer to Bushire letter Mo.447 of 1920 dated the 13th iiarch 1920 and your endorsement dated the 13th August 1920 ho.1354/20 forwarding notifications appointing Ahan bahib Oaiyid Siddi^ Hasan a 2nd Class Magistrate, and a Subordinate Judge of the 2nd Class, ircm this correspondence it is clear that the Indian Assistant has to be specifically empowered by name by Government Notification to exercise Civil and Criminal Powers in Bahr in. Prom the time of Khan oahifc Oaiyid 5iddi^ Hasan’s succession it has been the custom for the Political Agents fhe Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel f.C. Powle, G.B.A., Political itesident in the rersian Gulf* Bushire.- 2 - Agente to alter the Indian Assistant’s power as considered necessary without reference to higher authority. I can find no order appointing Khan Bahadur ’Abdul Haiy and am certain that no Notification has issued. This means that he has never been a Kagistrate or a Sub-Judge. In practice he has been exercising the powers of a Magistrate 2nd Class. Again he tries most cases sunnarily under Section 260 Criminal Procedure Code which no 2nd Class Magistrate can be empowered to do. Further, repatriations are ordered which amount to deportations and no report is made nor has the Indian Assistant any legal right to make such orders. 3. I wish to make it clear that I do not think that the present incumbent is in any way to blame. He carried on as his predecessor did and as I have said before it was a very good way for the times, but unfortunately times are changing. I would further like to esy that there is a regrettable lack of observance of the right procedure, but nothing else can be expected when it is realized that officials are sent here to exercise Magisterial and Judicial powers who have had no previous training. 4. I suggest that the position be regularized by the Government of India issuing a Notification appointing Khan Bahadur ’Abdul Haiy El Ha shiny, Indian Assistant at Bahrain, a Magistrate of the 1st Class empowered to try cases summarily under Section 260 Criminal Procedure Code and a Subordinate Judge of the 2nd Class. The increase in powers can be justified by the increase in the foreign population owing to the Oil Company’s activities and the summary powers may be justified on the grounds that there area number of petty cases that do not warrant the waste of time occasioned by a long trial* fhat these offences have increased in recent years and render summaiy powers essential* 5# I suggest that the question be considered of amending the Bahrain Order-in-Oouncil by a King’s Begulation under Section 70(a; to empower any person appointed as Indian Assistant to exercise powers as a Magistrate 1st Class with summaiy powers and as a Subordinate Judge of the End Class# lours sincerely,V/ ii 4 ✓ ' «/i J 11^2.

It came to light that none of the Bairain Government taxes introduced after the promulgation of the Bahrain Order in Council had been applied to British subjects or foreigners so taet they were not applicable to them ana never had been. Tne Muharraq Municipality rules and all the llanamali Buies after 1B21 were also non operative as regards British subjects and foreigners.

The necessity of Gazette notification is not specifically laid down in the various Orders-in-Council, nor elsewhere, and our legal adviser has minuted that the provisions of the Indian tivilence Act (which applies in the Gulf States) are more or less similar to those of the Documentary evidence Act, 1868 to sections 67(7) and 78(3) of which he draws attention. 3 .

I am afraid it has taken rather a long time to investigate the legal problems involved, but we have now prepared draft instruments for signature by the Secretary of State appointing Lr. Isharat Hussain to be a Magistrate of the B’irst Class and a Suborainate Judge of the Second Class with effect from 12th June. I enclose copies of the draft instruments of appointment and of the draft notifications for publication in the London Gazette, fou will notice that we propose to omit specific reference to the grant of powers to try cases summarily as defined in Section 260 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898. This is because it seems to us that the point is adequately covered by the grant of 'all powers opecii leu in the f ourth~STrh.edule to the said code', since the powers as defined in Section 260 are includeu in the fourth schedule. We should be glad to know whether you agree to the revised drafts and, if not, why a separate notice under Section 260 was considered necessary, ^s soon as we hear that you do agree, we shall submit the instrument of appointment to the Secretary of State for signature and arrange for the publication of the appointment in the Gazette. It seems to us important that notification of the appointment should also be published, in the same terms, in Bahrain, and you could no doubtarrange for this. We are still unable to tkke action on the appointment of Mr. Rashid idunad because, unuer Section 17 of the Muscat Orderrin-Council, the authority empowered to appoint magistrates is the Governor-General, a revised order is in course of preparation under which appointments will be made by the Secretary of State. When this has been issued we shall take the necessary action. Yours ever, Sd/- R.E. BARCLAY. Lieutenant-Colonal Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., BAHRAIN. (TRUE COPY)Draft Notice for 'London Gazette ^ Foreign Office, 1948 In exercise of the powers conferred on him by Section 14 of the Bahrein Order in Council 1913 ana by Sections 12 and 37 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (Act V of 1898) as applied to Bahrein by the said Order, His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has appointed (with effect from 12th June 1948) Mr. Isharat Husain, Inaian /.ssistant to the Political Agent, Bahrein, to be a iagistrate of the First Class within the limits of the said Order and has invested hi n with all the powers specified in the fourth scheuuie ‘to the said Code as powers with which a Magistrate of the First Class may be invested by a local Government.2. Yes. The Judicial Assistant should be gazetted with all the powers mentioned in the fourth schedule of the Criminal Procedure Code. Hafiz has them and there is no reason why Isharat Husain should not have exercised them. 3. The notices be published by being put on the office notice board. This is always considered official 'Publication” of new King’s regulations etc. a Of iviajor A.L.A. Dredge, M.B.ifi., Persian Gulf Residency, , Bahrain. NNR i Xhjl'' I enclose herewith an extract from a letter from Sir Eric Beckett which explains how Assis tant Judges of the Court of tfce^Political Agent will be appointed in future and how their powers will be regulated. By virtue of Article 92 of the new Bahrain Order-in-Council Hafiz can presumably exercise the powers granted to him under the old Order. It appears desirable however that he should be r appointed an Assistant Judge under the new Order and If you agree would you kindly make a formal application to me accordingly. In view of the definition of 'Political Agent' in the new Trucial States Order it is per haps not necessary to appoint Stobart as an Assis tant Judge under it but it is for consideration whether he should not be appointed an Assistant Judge under the Bahrain and Qatar Orders. Do you consider that Jasim should be appoint ed an Assistant Judge under the Trucial States£ 2 £I EXTRACT from letter dated 24th February from Sir Eric Beckett to Sir Rupert Hay. When in future we want to appoint persons to sit as judges in any of your courts, we shall be able to dfc it directly under the Order in Council, and there will have to be no more fefe- rences to any Articles of any Indian codes. Moreover, a person will either be a judge of the court of the Political Agent or he will not. There will be no question in future of investing a person with the limited powers of a magistrate of this or that class. This does not mean, how ever, that because Mr.X is appointed an Assistant Judge of the court of the Political Agent, he has necessarily got to deal with every case that comes up. The Political Agent himself, as the Presi dent of the court, allocates business as between himself and his Assistant, and he can see that his Assistant only takes those cases which he thinks would be suitable and he takes the others for himself.No.C/R-173 To POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN, 1st May, 1949. ! His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.
