The Resident favours the account provided by Mahomed Khan [Muḥammad Nabī Khān] which claims the French were defeated and Napoleon Bonaparte is missing, as he believes that the Persian Court has a habit of presenting situations as they wish them to be. The Resident also outlines his suspicions that the Persian Government seeks an alliance with the French in order to strengthen their position against the Russians.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre></mods></metadata></record>
