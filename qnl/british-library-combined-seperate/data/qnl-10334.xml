The report also discusses the desired terms of succession from the perspective of the British Government, the political climate in Muscat and its relations with the Omani tribes, and the claims to power being made by different candidates. The report also includes a summary of the relationship between the British Government and local leadership and a review of the current Commercial Treaty and subsidies between the British Government and Muscat.The file also includes translated letters of Abdul Aziz bin Said al-Bu Sa‘idi (ff 40-44), in which he gives his own vision regarding Oman and its people and regarding the issue of the succession.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Ṣāliḥ bin ‘Alī al-Ḥārthī</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Abdul Azīz bin Sa‘īd Āl Bū Sa‘īd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00028a#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00028a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
