The first case discussed is that of Jose Pedro d’Souza, a Portuguese Goan, who died during a visit to Persia in 1925, whilst employed as a cook by the Political Agent, Kuwait. This correspondence includes an enquiry by his employer into the circumstances of his death, the arrangements for his Christian burial in Persia, and the despatch of money and possessions to his widow in Goa. The second case concerns the death of Haji bin Muhenna Hasawi, an owner of property who died in Bahrain in 1930 and who had appointed his son, resident in Kuwait, as executor of his will. The main correspondents are Major James Carmichale More and his successor Lieutenant Colonel Harold Richard Patrick Dickson as Political Agent, Kuwait, and Mr W G Huxley, Superintendent, Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Section, Shiraz. The correspondence includes a letter in Portuguese from the Political Agent, Kuwait to the widow of Jose Pedro d’Souza, living in Goa, in 1925. There is also an exchange of letters in Arabic between the Political Agent, Kuwait and Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah [Āl Ṣabāḥ, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir] the Ruler of Kuwait, in 1930.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indo-European Telegraph Department, Persian Section</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Maria Cecilia Correia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Jose Pedro d'Souza</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Registration of death</topic></subject><subject><topic>Probate</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b2#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
