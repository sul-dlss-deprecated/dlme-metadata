H. Ellis, dated the 9/A October 1865. In reply to the letter from the Government of India, Foreign Depart- * Mr. Edward, No. 39, 15th August 1865. ment, No. 809 of the 20th Colonel Disbrowe, No. 171, 22iid August 1865. SeptembGI* 1865, Copies Ditto No. 182, 26th August 1865. should be sent of Colonel Disbrowe's and Mr. Edward's letters noted in the margin.* The case seems to me to stand briefly thus:— The Wahabee power in Central Arabia, during the latter part of the last century and the first twenty years of this, was known to the Indian Government as the chief instigator of the Arab piracy, which scourged and nearly extin guished the commerce of the Persian Gulf, and seriously affected the commerce of these Seas as far South and East as Ceylon. The influence of the Arab leaders of the Wahabees was partly founded on their aggressive and martial spirit, and partly on the religious fanaticism which was excited by the preaching of the Wahabee reformers. About forty-five years ago the temporal power of the Wahabees received several severe checks. Ibrahim Pacha attacked them by land, occupied their capital, and for a time almost destroyed their political influence in Northern and Western Arabia. An expedition fitted out from Bombay, attacked some of the piratical ports on the Arabian Coast where Wahabee influence was most powerful; inflicted a considerable amount of chastisement on the most troublesome tribes, and these measures having been followed up by an increase of efficiency to the Bombay Marine, afterwards the Indian Navy, Arab piracy was for some years rarely heard of till lately. About the same time that Ibrahim Pacha was pressing the Wahabees by land, and the British Cruizers curbing their pirate disciples by sea, the late Imaum of Muscat, a wise and active Prince, opposed them in Oman, and prevented any extension of their temporal power in that direction. So completely was the temporal power of the Wahabees checked that they had been almost forgotten in the Indian political world, save as a dangerous sect of religious fanatics whose Indian disciples, at various times and at far distant points, have frequently caused anxiety to the British rulers of India during the past 30 years. There can be no doubt that the Wahabees have of late shown a considerable revival of their former activity, both as an aggressive temporal power in the interior of Arabia, and as leaders of fanatical revival in India. There seems much ground for believing that the great increase, which has taken place during the last ten years, in the slave trade between East Africa and Arabia, is due to a new direction having been given to the naval enterprise of the tribes on the sea coast which were formerly most imbued with Wahabee fanaticism and most active in piracy.The visits of Mr. Palgrave and Colonel Pelly to the Wahabee capital have thrown great light upon the resources of this power, and the information record ed by these travellers shows very clearly that the Wahahees have of late years been recovering from the effects of the chastisement formerly inflicted on them, and that they are likely to become exceedingly troublesome to all in contact with them, who will not submit to their religious domination. Apart from any internal impulse given by a revived spirit of religious fanaticism there are several obvious causes of the late development of Wahabee aggressive power in Arabia. Much is of course due to the natural effects of so many years of comparative rest in repairing their exhausted resources; something also no doubt to the dis appearance of the generation which had experienced the power of the Egyptian Pacha, the late Imaum of Muscat, and of British Naval and Military expeditionary forces. More however is probably owing to the sensible decay of vigour in the ruler of Muscat, and to the comparative rarity of any visit from our vessels of war to the old pirate coast of the Persian Gulf. But whatever the cause, there can be no doubt of the evil effects of this revival of Wahabee power, and it is clear that these effects cannot be confined to the Continent of Arabia. We have had more than one warning sympton during the past year or two of a possible revival of piracy on our own Indian Coasts. There is every year increased activity in the slave trade carried on between East Africa and Arabia, chiefly by vessels belonging to the Wahabee pirate ports, and the aggressions of the Wahabees by land on the territories of the Imaum of Muscat, threaten seriously to injure a power which for several generations past has been the only representative of civilization and order in Eastern Arabia. I do not think that this is a state of things in which the British Government in India should be entirely passive. Our interest in the matter is not precisely the same as in 1821, when the pfrates from the Wahabee coast threatened serious injury to the general trade of Bombay; but we have Treaty ties with the Imaum of Muscat, and there can be no doubt that any considerable increase of Wahabee influence would lead to, at least, an attempt to revive piracy, and seriously impede the rapidly increasing commerce of the Persian Gulf. It might also at any time interfere with our Telegraphic communication with Europe. The important question remains what it behoves the British Government to do under these circumstances? It seems quite clear that there is little chance of the Ameer paying the slightest attention either to such friendly advice as Colonel Pelly gave him, or to the temperate remonstrances of Colonel Disbrowe. I would not for the present advise any renewal of an attempt on the part of our Political Agents to open a diplomatic correspondence with the Ameer of the Wahabees. He is from his ignorance of our power not likely to pay the slightest attention to our wishes or remonstrances, and for the present any attempt to open further communication with him is only likely to embroil us further. I would instruct Colonel Disbrowe to adopt a somewhat different tone to His Highness the Imaum of Muscat; to point out to His Highness clearly, but in temperate and friendly language, that the aggressions of the Wahabees are not likely to be checked by tame acquiescence, or by a constantly increasing addition3 of the tribute His Highness pays to them, that the Government of India will learn with regret, and surprize that its subjects have been murdered and plundered in a large town under His Highness' flag without any effectual attempt on His Highness' part to punish his own rebellious subjects, or to expel hostile invaders. 1 would point out to His Highness that the occasion is one which imperatively calls upon him to imitate the example of his illustrious father, to set his finances in order, to conciliate and revive the spirit of his feudatory tribes, to re-organize his military and naval forces, and to repel by force, if negotiation fail, the insolent aggressions of his Wahabee neighbours. I would not by any means lead him to lean on our aid in accomplishing these objects, but I would assure him of our intention scrupulously to fulfil our Treaty obligations, and of our desire to give him every reasonable support, not only moral but material, in any well-directed efforts he may make to re-establish his authority. There can be no doubt that His Highness' power, if properly exerted, is ample to effect all that is required. I would aid him with munitions, and, if j? absolutely necessary, with assistance in money, and with the presence of such ships of Her Majesty's naval forces in these Seas as the Commander-in-Chief may think best calculated to be of use in aiding the Imaum to re-establish His Highness' authority in Soor or any other place on the seaboard, of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabee enemy may have deprived him. Colonel Pelly may be expected to return from his leave by the in-coming Mail, and I would propose to send him to Muscat, in the first instance, before he proceeds to Bushire, with such instructions as the Governor General may approve. With this view these proceedings should be at once reported to the Governor General, and early instructions should be solicited. Copies should be sent to the Secretary of State. (Signed) H. B. E.
