The figure faces left with raised right arm, horizontal left arm holding a life-sign in hand.  Rising from a modius atop a wig adorned with a fillet is the lower portion of a crown consisting of tall plumes fronted by cow's horns, and presumably, a solar disk. Around the fillet is coiled the body of a cobra whose head and spread hood rise before the figure's head.  The figure wears a broad-collar necklace, represented in relief, and a tight dress starting just below the breasts and ending in a scalloped hemline. Remains of pigment indicate that the dress was painted blue with a central vertical panel of red.  Areas of red pigment are also found on the figure's face, chest, and arms.  Blue-green pigment indicates armlets and bracelets were painted on the figure. Before the figure is a partially preserved column of hieroglyphic text.  Figure and text are framed at the side by raised border lines.                                                                          \r\n\r\n", "medium": "Sandstone, pigment", "dimensions": "29 x 15 3/4 x 2 3/4in.
