It notes therefore that the Resident suspects the Shaikh is attempting win the favour of the Pasha because of his influence with Ameer Fysul [Amīr Fayṣul], and to deprive his kinsmen at Demaun [Ad-Dammān] of the support of 'the Wahabee Chief' [Wahhabi].The Resident recommends that British Agents in Egypt are ordered to ascertain the nature of the Shaikh's proposals, as any interference with the Turkish Government in the affairs of Bahrein could cause the British embarrassment.The item has three enclosures:1. Translated extract of a letter from Hajee Jassem, Agent at Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 29 May 1853.The enclosure reports on Bihjut Effendi's preparations for his return to Egypt, and the Shaikh of Bahrein's plans to send an envoy with letters for Abbass Pasha.2.
