He was pessimistic as to being able to get Taimur to agree to it without a threat or even the actual use of force. I therefore suggested that the question be discussed with General Birdwood and Colonels Edwardes and Smith quite apart from its political aspect. This was done but without any very definite result. It was agreed that about 300 men would be necessary, that the Political Agent should be Commandant and^there be 2 or if possible 3 British Officers. That the corps should be started with say some 100 time-expired men from Indian Regiments, and that men be gradually en listed from Mekran, Baluchistan and if possible Oman and Nejd. No definite opinion as to cost could be formed and it was decided that in regard to this, enquiries would have to be made from India. Whole subject might be discussed with General Bird- wood while en route to Bahrain especially question of location of Corps. Beit-al-Raraj seems to me to be an excellent place to put them.Telegram.

It is possible that a secret arrangement might be arrived at that, if the establishment of a levy corps for the Sultan armed, equipped, and paid through British or Kacxtiax Native officers, werenecessitated in consequence of th&amp; probable breakdown of the negotiations which are at present in hand, His Highness should agree to accept the proposal in prin ciple. The British Government would meet a moiety of the cost in the form of an additional subsidy, and the remaind er would be provided by the Masqat State, its contribution to be met from the Zanzibar subsidy of Rs 7200/- and to be limited to that amount. It is hoped that the first de- sideratuie may be obtained without much difficulty if authority to conclude an agreement can be accorded to me. The second will be contentious, and as in my opinion the important thing is to save the present administration from financial collapse, I would prefer that it should be time and discassion would be required by either the Govern ment or the Sultan before acceptance of even the general hypothetical principle. At the same time the Sultan should be spurred on to brinf the present impasse to an end by the probability that the cost of maintainihg a body of men which he could only control, in the nature of things, to a limited externa,would eat up his Zanzibar subsidy; and in bringing the rebels to reason the project should form an effective weapon. x x X dropped temporarily, should it be felt that considerable KnoxTelegram.

XX XX as regards the proposal that the Sultan should be asked to a^ree to the creation of a levy corps , commanded by British or Indian Officers in the event of his failing to come to terms with the tribal chiefs , Sir Edward Grey has no objection to offer from an int ernatio4al point of view so long as the corps is nominally a Masqat force, and the o fioers , by whom it is commanded , nominally in the Sultans service . Precedents are not lacking to justify the conclusion of such an arrangement by an independent sovereign. x x x x x Original on 35/106. 6 A (a ■No. 1292-D., (Confidential) dated Delhi, the 12th March 1914. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Henry McMahon , G .C .V.O., K.C .I .E. C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Politica 1 Department, To— Major S. G. Knox , C .I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to invite a referene to the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, No. D. S.-67, dated the 21st Jan uary 1914, intimating that it has been decided to consider separately the questions (a) of the creation of a levy corps at Maskat, and (b) of obtaining an undertaking from His Highness the Sultan of Maskat not to conclude fresh treaties with foreign powers without the assent of His Majesty's Government. 2. It is understood that the primary object of the proposed levy corps is to enable the withdrawal of the Indian troops at present garrisoning the towns of Maskat and Matrah and to place at the nominal disposition of the Sultan a locally raised force sufficient to assert his authority, defend his capital against rebellious tribesmen and furnish a reserve from which detachments may be drawn to garrison such of His Highness' inland forts as he may hereafter recover. There is, from an international point of view, no objection to the creation of such a force on the basis proposed by Sir P. Cox in his telegram No. 15-M., dated the 14th October 1913, provided that the corps is nominally a Maskat force and that the officers by whom it is commanded, whether British or Indian, are nominally in the Sultan's service. But unless the corps is carefully handled it is not free from risk. If the corps should be imposed on the Sultan against his will and he neither takes part in its work nor accepts responsibility for it, he will lose repute and authority with the tribal chiefs and will not be likely to re-establish satis factory relations with them. His consent and good will are, therefore, essential. Again, unless the territorial limits within which the force may operate are strictly defined, it may be tempted to embark upon hazardous adventures and may suffer a reverse that might entail the despatch of a regular force from India. The corps should be under the same restrictions against taking the offensive against the enemy in the interior as have been placed upon the Indian garrison. I am to request that you will kindly submit your views on the above with the report called for in the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 493-S., dated the 4th November 1913, and a detailed estimate of the cost involved in the scheme. v 'Z g^Lam also to request a fuller expression of your views on the question of In ilii^iiTTtii 1i|i|]|l nf Hn observations made in the Foreign Office letter of the 23rd January 1914, acTTp^^^l^hich was forwarded to you with the endorsement from the Government of IndmTlT^fe«^oreign and Political Department, No. 1039-D.

Dated 9th April 1914 ( 3.40 p.m.) C/juLiffy is 11 i ) \ | Bonn reports by letter from Masqat under date 5th, April series of events from 29th March. General situation appears/ disquieting and Sultar^s efforts to raise money and enlist foreign aid do not reassure me. Following are most significant items of news;- (1). Sultan has apparently appealed to Wali of Basrah for help in money or men. (2), A Jemadar Qasim, lately Returned from Basrah, is said to have arranged with a Pathan *Abdue Rahman, Jemadar Chokidar of Messrs Gray Mackenzie Basrah, to enlist 200 Pathans for service with Sultan. (3). An attempt is to be made to enlist Baluchis from Bampur. (4), 1 Ali bin Salim, late Sultan's cousin, accompanied by *Abdul Aziz, French Consulate dragoman, visited French Consul three times on 3rd April. We cannot regard with equanimity any of these measures! (1). It is difficult to see what possible response Wall Basrah can give to this wild appeal and I think Poli tical Agent might simply address a remonstrance oo the Sultan showing its futility and folly. (3). Unorganised Pathans and Baluchis will only add^to disorderly elements in town and probably decamp with sry rifles and ammunition given them, possibly pur chasing others. They will be entirely useless afeainst local Arabs. Political Agent should emphatically dis courage these plans# (4). I think Political Agent should endeavour to learn independently and by direct enquiry from His Highness sirnificance of 'Ali bin Salim's visits to FrGn^h Consul. A talk over situation with his French Oolleague might possibly elicit useful information. He snould report result by telegraph. Time has, I think, now come for a straight talk with Sultan pointing out the idiocy of wasting money on hin Arao forces. The 'Om-ni tribes are following out their old policy of bleeding Sultan. One section draw pay from him and render no service in exchange, the other are in possession of his territoryIS territory and feed on his estates. Pie should be warned that we will not lend money to be squandered in these direc tions and shall forbid our subjects to lend him rmaney either, until he gives us guarantee that these loans and the revenues of the country are being spent in serious efforts to pacify it, especially the Wadi Samall. For the present, it seems impossible to do anything except stick to the Masqat Matrah enclave organise the Levy Corps and prepare for an advance to Samail in October next. The object of this advance would be to install Nadir, or some other well qualified selection of Sultan there as Governor, have Ports at Bidbid and Samail put in thorough order and garrisoned by at least a company each of the new Levy Corps, whose head quarters should be in Sib. It would pro bably be necessary to leave a double company with machine gun section at Bait al Falaj to frighten off any marauding raids down Wadi 1 Adai behind back of Wadl Samail. Political advisers, preferably selected natives of India, paid from Customs revenues and in close touch wihii Political Agent, would be required, one at Masqat for Sultan and one at Samail for Nadir. Latter could gradually, in consultation with Nadir subsidise selected tribal petty Chiefs to maintain communications from Samail to Sib and Masqat. When these arrangements are complete, our troops could withdraw. It is essentially a cold weather job and would necessitate employment of troops for from two or three months next winter and maintenance of Bait al Falaj garri son to the end of the year. But it seems the only hope of .re-establishing Sultan's authority, a useful asset to us. As price Df this material assistance, Sultan should under take to manage Masqat and Matrah customs under our advice and devote Zanzibar subsidy to expense of Levy Corps and secret but effective understanding that he will correspond with no foreign governments unrepresented at Masqat except through us. In our turn, we bear all costs ox expedi t-ion to reestablish his authority in Samial and balance of ex- psnditure on Levy Corps. KNOX./b f Telegram. From Lieutenant Colonel Benn,P.A. Masqat.

Be it known to whoever sees this our letter, that it is our intention to organise an army from the inhabitants of Maskat, Matrah, Sidab, Kalbu, Eiyam and Mutairah only. Whatever be the class of the intending recruits who come from these towns they will be organised into a standing army and will be fully armed. Who so choses to serve and remain in this organised body, should come forward and present himself to us, so that the selecting officer may see whether an intend ing recruit is fit for service and may also inform him of the pay as well as of the rules and regulations he will be required to follow. And the organisation will be of two kinds, namely, (1) for artillery service and (2) simple infantry, and the intending recruit will be free to make his own choice (as to which of the two services he will join). And we hope and trust that every youth will be impelled by patriotic zeal to come forward for these noble services. No one of an age above 30 years will be accepted by the Government, but men under 30 years of age down to 15 years will be acceptable. Men of free and liberal minds will (we hope) be prompted by their own inclination (to enlist) rather than through the employ ment of force by us or their kith and kin so that this may not be hidden, and salaam.Confidential.

Rustom Khan would give you an idea of suitable wage for Baluchis serving in Masqat and that would be a fair guide for the other contingents. The varying rations mi ht be a bother. I hope these rough notes may be of some use, but I recognise the difficulty of draw ing up a Scheme, when you don't know if your men will spend their lives in Matrah or will go further afield to Samail or Sur.

His Highness explained his orereiit ( .^^i;. i n. k 1 ^r vi q,. .,1 ] (,t ) and city guard . a'oout tliree hundred men % were unreliable lot inlisted by his fathers from Yaman and elsewhere and that thelar officers were altogether corrupt. It was,he said, in order to obtain local men to replace these that proclamation was published . His Highness proposes to tilist aoo selected men in lieu of the 300 men. His Highness said he had already written to India for services of a pensioned Indian Officer of the Indian Army to be in charge of them . His Highness however acided there had been very meagre response to his proclamation and scarcely 20 men had volunteered for service. His Highness does not wish Levy Corps to be employed in any way within palace precincts or as city guards, for v-uich duties he desires his own arrange ments as heretofore . I think in this mat tea 0 his wishes should be respected . His Hig'mess asked that Lwyy Corps should be for the present not more than 300 strong Including two British Officers and he asked, me to submit details of scheme as soon as possible. I s lonld be glad if officer Commanding Kekray. Levy Corps could be asked to send me as soon as possible papers that would assist me and serve as guide.

In compliance with the instructions contained.in para graph 5 of your above quoted letter I have now the honour, to submit a detailed ' Scheme with Estimates for Raising and Main-, .taining a Levy Corps for Mascat '. It will be observed,that,the Scheme Involves an Annual and Re curring Expenditure nf fyyl .40518-0-0 and an Initial Expendit ure of R.y. ^5042-043 . or a, total expenditure during, the first year n&lt; ' R?- ^Q-r-0. 5. Before proceeding to deal with,the details^of.the Scheme and Estimate I would beg. to preface, this-report, with, the follow. remarkst - The question of• raising a local force for,the protection of Mascat and Matrah and.to act as a garrison,In reliefs of the:2. British.troops no^ quartered.there has been under.the consider ation of. the Government of India since October 1 last yean and though the subjest was, I understand, infonnaily suggested.to .the Sultan at.the time. His Highness does not seem,to have ser iously realised.the necessity for such a force until March of .the present year, when.the recurrence of unrest-in.the:interior and the increased activity of.the rebels caused him to give.the matter his more serious attention# Until.then His Highness appears to have counted on.the continued'retention of a garri-: son of British troops at Bfcit-^l-Falaj and to have even enter-' .tained the hope.that our.troops would b® permitted.to undertake .offensive operations against.the enemy in the interior. It was only on learning th?.t. the. indefinite&gt; retention of our .troops and their employment in.the interior were out of.the question.that His Highness-really realized that his only hope of ever re-establishing his authority in.the interior lay.in .the establishment of a disciplined locaLCoinps of his own# Since.then,as the telegrams I have sent you from. time. to. time will have shewn. His Highness has.in conversation always assur ed me of his earnest desire, te see the Levy Corps Scheme carr-r; ied out, and he has invariably laid stress on. the point, that it should be under.the supervision of British Officers, at any • rate during its infancy. On.the Jrd'June last, without troubling His Highness with un necessary details, I briefly outlined the main points of a skeleton scheme,which I had prepared, mainly with a view to ascertaining His Highness 1 views as to the composition and strength of the Corps and of.the amount-of pay.to be given to different ranks. it the same.time l.tooK.the opportunity of i explaining.to His Highness the main objects, oi.the Corps, being guided.in my remarks by the principles■laid down In.the Govern or India's letter No.1292 of 12th. March 1914. I explained •.that all matters of pay,arms and equipment connected with the .Corps would naturally be dealt with by.the Officer Commanding' ■ &lt;a) r ■5. the Corps and that with regard to. the movements and disposition . of the troops it would be: important for His'Highmess 0 ^^ wishes ^ ^ rature of Government. In this way a &gt; general Idea oi the., nominal / hiscontrol r ^ . . TDEtHCC® of.the Corps was convayed.to His Highness, whothowever, offered no comment, on.it. As regards the cost of.the corps His Highness at first demurred somewhat at.the^raite of pay sug gested, especially.that proposed for.the sepoy ; but he finally agreed to.the proposals under.this head. The Scheme as a whole at first seemed.to stride His Highness as being rather more elaborate.than he had anticipated and he seemed apprehen sive, that the cost would probably be beyond his means. His Highness, however, gave the scheme his provisional approval and at the same.time he repeated.the request which he had alread- made,to me on more,than one occasion,.that.the new Corps should -.to use his own expression - ' resemble.the British troops at mak MX jbss U b I h Bait-al-Falaj as much as possible f, 9 in order that 'the enemy might still continue to-regard.the force at Bait-al-Falaj as troops of.the British Government '.the Bxaadr ' re&amp;iarded moral effect of whose presence.there, which His Highness/as a most powerful weapon in his hands,would,he feared,be lost by.the substitution of whatmight appear.to be a less regular and.disc iplined force. Should.the present Scheme appear at first sight,to be a somewhat elaborate and costly one,.the only explanation I can offer is ±k .that I have endeavoured.to carry out His Highness 1 wishes in.the above respect. My aim has been,to evolve a local force, less elaborate and costly # r though in no way less efficient- than our regular Indian troops or our Indian Frontier Militias, but more highly organised and equipped than the xagMiac irregu lar. Tribal Levies of Baluchistan. His Highness being in accord with me on the general lines of the Scheme as far as the composition of. the Corps was concerned and his ve^al consent. thereto having been secured, it was arranged' 4 * ST that I should proceed to work out . the Scheme in more detail and submit a complete Estimate of its cost for His Highness 1 further consideration* The attached Estimate,is.the result. As His Highness has been away from Mascat for the past 3 weeks and is still absent I have had no opportunity of discussing it with him in its more complete form. Nor f indeed f do I. think it would be expedient to do so until you yourself have had an opportunity of criticising it and submitting it.to.the Govern ment of India for any modifications.that may be considered necessary. 4. I will now deal with.the main points; of. the Scheme that appear,to me.to call for remark t- 1 ^i)• British Officers. That.the supervision of the Corps should be in.the hands of a British Officer is I.thinK essential and it.is hoped that,th^s proposal will meet with approval. A Native Officer. in Com mand might find it difficult to withstand any pressure that His Highness might at times attempt.to exercise over hiuu Moreover,.the ultimate efficiency and moral tone of the Corps must,I.think,depend entirely on.the early training it will rec eive in its infancy, and such training^ can only be carried out.to.the best advantage under the supervision of a British • rather.than a Native Officer. Cii). Strength of Cores. The strength proposed ( 300 Fighting men )■is r that.suggested in Sir Percy Cox's telegram,No.15 M of l4th.October 1913,to .the Government of India,and -as reported in my. telegram No.121 of 15th.May 1914. to your address- agreed, to by H.H.The Sultan- The number is less by 75 men.than.the strength of.the British garrison now considered necessary for the protection ol Mascat and Matrah* I venture.to.think,that it represents.the minimum strength necessary to efficiently carry out.the duties.that.the,Corps will be called upon.to perform -more especially:if,as seems5. required iiKeiy, it will be MjciaXBst. to garrison certain outposts, in the interior as well as. to find a permanent garrison at Head Quarters. (iii) • Rates of Pay of British Officers,Indian RanK &amp; File. .The pay proposed for.the British Officers has been calcuiited on.the assumption,that officers of.the rank of Captain and Lieutenant.in the Indian Army will be selected for.the posts .of Commandant and Adjutant respectively. 1T0. their pay as such tau timn xistmk a suitable addition has been made; in view of the special nature of.the service they will be called on.to perform and the extra cost of living, in Mascat* Their pay is no doubt a heavy item,amounting, as it does,.to Rs# 19,200. on account of pay and Rs. 16,200/ on account, of the Contribution/which His Highness will ha\e.to pay,making a.total-of Rs. 55*400/ annualIv under.this head alone* As-regards the pay of the Native ranks.this has been fixed, as explaiaed in.the body of. the Scheme, after. taJking into consideration.the unfavourable climatic and other conditions under which the corps will have.to serve. The rates of pay en joyed by regular, troops serving in Oman and. the Gulf and by .the Levy Corps serving in Mekran have also been taken as a guide, while.the amount paid by His Highness to the Baluchis recently enlisted for service in his Palace and City Guards has also been.taken int6 consideration. The rates now Drooosed for the new Corps comprise 'Pay' 1 , ' Mascat Allowance 11 and ' Compensa/tion for deamess of Rations .They.total considerably less.than.the pay and allowances enjoyed by.the regular.troops serving in Oman andt .the Gulf, and -except in a few instances-.they are about eq ual to the rates obtaining in.the Mekran Lev^ Corps. The H l Compensation for dearness of rations ' now proposed is about half of that enjoyed by. the regular, troops of. the Mascat .Consulate Guard. No provision has been made in. these Estimates for ' Good Ser- for Pension6* 6 0 Service Pay ' in.the. caise of Non-commissioned Officers, or for M Good Conduct Pay ' in. the case of Sepoys* iThis pri\- eiege.is enjoyed by. the Regular Army and by. the 'Zhob and Mek- - ran Leiy Corps* The question of granting it. to. the Mascat Levy Corps will no doubt be raisedi in due course* If event ually, it is granted,tha.it would involve an additional annual ai^roxiTa'' 1 ^ ^ v expenditure at ranging/from a minimum cost of Rs*144/ after 2 years service.to a maximum of Rs.b76/ after 4iyears in.the case of Non-Comirissicned officers on account of Good Service Pay, and .in. the case of. the Sepoy a minimum annual cost (tanging from Rs* 5264/ after 3 ^ears to a maximum of Rs*9792 after 10 years ■on account of Good Conduct Pay* The remaining items under Annual &amp; Recurring Expenditure are fully explained, in. the body of. the Scheme and call for no fur- .ther remarn here* Under n Initial Expenditure M no parovision has been made for .^Buildings 1 because in the absence of expert and professisnal assistance it was found impossible.to make an&gt; estimate.that would be-reliable* &gt;. There, is no doubt however, that. the cost of erecting permanent Barracks would be yery hea'vv and.it would BSt fitctfctxfc oe advisable, to defer embarking on any expenditure on.this account until experience has. shewn what.the actual requirements of the new Corps will be and the. type oi build ing, that would be iDflj$irost suitable* Some sort; of. temporary shelter will however be necessary for. the men:during, the ex- .trerre heat of. the summer and a sun of Rs .2000/ for mat huts, similar.to.those erected for.the regular, troops at bait al Fa- la has been provided* Anothear item for which no provision has been made is a Machine Gun, which woulti undoubtedly be a useful -rif not essential- addition, to. the Corps and one.that would certainly find favour with His Highness* As already confidentially reported His Highness has already purchased 2 Quick -firing Machine Qms which I understand are of a portable.type and it is possible- ri - f . • wws^t,-W \„ 1- ((' that^His Highness-ma^ be willing.to place one of.these at. the disposal of. the Corps and thus sate any further expenditure on this account* Should.this suggestion, however, not meet with approval an estiirate of cost MH&amp;a in. this connection will be sufciDittea 5* As&gt;regards the question of how the cost of.the Corps is. to be met I would irention. that His Highness has never definitely stated his inability.to meet.the entire cost him self, but he has on rrore.than one occasion hinted, that it would be beyond his means , to creet any very large expenditure on this account. Some idea of , the extent to which Kis High ness seeired prepared, to go in. this respect may be gathered from a remark he irade to rre.that in his opinion, the Zanzibar subsidy would be 11 more than sufficient, to coxer.the cost of .the,Corps '. As will be seen from.these estimates.the Zanzibar subsidy would coier onlv a little o'ver half. the pro- annual posed cost of.the new corps* Half.the/cost of.the Corps comes, to Rs* 7 0 259/* .The Zanzibar subsidv amounts to R§_. §6400. His Highness has ne^er raised, the cuestion of. the panlcipai- -ion by Government in.the expenses of.the corps, nor have I cared ever led His Highness to.think.tnat Government would be pte~/ to contribute, towards its establishment and rraintainanoe• But.this question, I.think, is bound.to come up now,if and when.the present Estiirate is presented to him. I would, therefore ask. that, the decision-of. the u^vemnert India in. this matter nay be obtained and communicated, to me. In.this connection it was suggested in Sir Percy Cox's.tele gram, No.15 K. of 14th. October 1915 to. the Government: of India, that the M cost would have, to be a charge on.Customs Revenue or on subsidies paid '• Ara .in in your telegram ( as Political Agent Mascat &gt; No. 215 dated 11th. December 1913 to the Resident , ia Bushire.it was proposed, that half , the cost should be paid from ana limit--ea. to.the present subsidy of Rs. 12QO/* per mensem which Mascat draws as Zanzibar subsidy. .The; other naif ; should be paid by. the British Government as an additional subsid}' '• I xenture .to express opinion, in favour of . the latter propo sal. But as. the Zanzibar subsidy ( Rs. S6400/ annually j co^rs more, than half, the annual carst of. the corps ( Rs .70259/) I wouldi suggest that.the whole of that subsidv be contributed by His Highness, and.that.the balance only ( Rs. 5411S/. ) be met by Go\ernment. The whole amount ( Rs. 140518/. ) should. I suggest, be placed under.the control of.the Political Agent Pascat who would sanction.its disbursement in accordance with an- annual Budget which, the Officer Connanding the Corps would sub it it and which would presumably have, to receive His Highness' informal approval. ^ , . ( Rs. 55042/ As■regards.the Initial Expenditure)required.the first year, / .this would coubtless have to.take.the form of a loan.to.the Sultar.to be repaid by him in instalments either from His Highness 1 other subsidy of Rs. 8535/5/4. per mensem or from his Customs Revenues. In. the latter case, I venture, to. think,-the Gov emu en t of Irdia - in order.to ensure.regular payments which might;otherwise be uncertain - would possibly deem.it expedient.to suggest.to His Highness.the advisibility of obtaining on loan.the services of British officials for the more profitable rranagerrent. of his Customs Departnent.

In fixing tie rate of pay of tire Indian officers ^Iton Ooimiii^sioned officers and rank and file,(more, especial3y t^at of tjlro sepoy) the following points Iave been taken into consideration;- (a) The disagreeable nature of e c3ixiiate and service in *OLian.

(c) The pay offered by His Highness to tine Baluclnis recen ul y en3 i3ted for Fis Hi&amp;hness • p al ac e and c i ty w ard s« In calculating t^e pay of vhe native ranks ol the new Corps, therefore, the pay of the different ranks in the regular ariay has been taken as a basis and to this has been added certain M alIowanc0s M on account of 'Hasqat allowance** and '0oupersation for deamess of rations'. The rates of pay prevail- -ing in the Mekran Levy Horps have also been taken as a .juide. To take the S above mentioned points separately:-/ (a.)

Britioh ReBidency and Consulat©-General, Bushire, 5th July 1914. From Major S.G. iiiox, C.I.E., Offg: political Hesident In the Persian Gulf. To The Hon 'ble Lieut-Colonel Sir P .Z .cox, K.C.I.E.,C.S.I. Foreign Secreary to the Government of India Foreign and Political Department, S I M L A. Sir, I have the honour to invite a reference to corres pondence ending with your letter No. 1292-D dated 12th March 1914 on the subject of the proposed Masqat Levy Corps, and to forward herewith a coi^y of the letter quoted No. 145 dated 29th June 1914. J in the margin, under oover of which the Political Agent, Masqat, forwards a complete Scheme for the establishment and maintenance of the proposed Corps. 2. Lieutenant Colonel Benn f s carefully considered propo sals appear to be, I venture to thinl:, in general accord witii tilo principles laid down in your letter already quo ted and, with some reservations in points of detail, which I siiall di cuss later, I venture to commend them to the favourable consideration of the Government of India. 3. I do not myself see any room for further economies in the Scheme presented by Lieutenant-Colonel Benn and tnere is, 1'or the present at any rate, much force in His Highness•rt) ,A / HigVincss* wish that his turbulent •Omani subjects i5hould continue to regard the new Corps as British. At the same time its cost will be a heavy burden on the slender financial re sources of His Highness the Sultan of lasqat, and I venture to plead with Government that the principle of half the cost being borne by them nay be admitted. The cost nay, however, vary in different years and it wovild save confusion if His were to Highness/surrender at once the whole of the Zanzibar subsidy towards tecost of the new Corps and Government render them selves responsible for the balance. As regards the initial expenditure of Re ^,000 I would recommend that it should be advanced by Government in the first instance with promise of repayment from the arms traffic subsidy, payment to commence two years after the inception of the Scheme. Interest at 4^ per annum on the loan would suffice to keep the obligatinn alive and, at the end of two years, we should be in a -ooni- tion to see whether the Scheme was running well and whether His Highness continued to afford it the full support and encouragement which are so desirable. If such proved to be the case, in consideration of this enlightened attitude and in view of the fact that the Masqat State was 'oaying more than a moiety of the cost of maintenance, it would, in my opinion, be a politic concession to forego the debt alto gether. 4. Should it be decided to saddle Customs Revenues with the repayment of this loan, Lieutenant-Colonel Benn suggests the advisability of His Highness obtaining an loan the services of British officials for the more profitable management of the Masqat Customs, while apologising for nrotruding a purely personal opinion, I may perhaps be permitted to remark that I have never been able to share the enthusiasm displayed in some quarters, for assuming the responsibility for the dis charge of such a difficult and thankless task, as the col lection of the Customs duties of backward and impoverished States. Our methods are expensive and a poor country like Masqat'{ Jf 1 Masqat, with a long straggling seaboard and an indeter- ^ ninate land frontier and difficult coviunications o neon 0UtT )055ts, would hardly pay for th©'E. Add to this that our prestige would suffer from the odium that invariably attach es to the tax-collector* Kor these reasons I would infinitely prefer to debit th© ryas Traffic subsidy with the renayment, ■; jl tf it must bo ronaid, of the initial expenditure on the asqat Levy Corps. 5« ith regard to the actual details of tile Scheme, I wottld Invito a reference to the naragra^h M Yilistznent' under II Organisation and Conetitution# I have sne doubts as to the suitability of Brahuis of • aferan and the Jhallawan country, Kalat -t te subjects- v tiey rre hillnien tmd, for the first ; i * i i year at any rate of the existence of tho Gor^s, would be serving in the torrid heat of the Mattra valley*I yield to no one in ray admiratio ■ of the many fine qu litles of the Brahuic with ^rhom, as Political Age t, Kalat, I was closely aosociated for na^.y years, but I only met one or t T TO of thorn at i asqat during my term of service there, and I am not fully convinced of their fitness to serve in that cliraata. Lieutenant Quay1e has cone in with a suggestion that may prove fruitful* He informs ne that the 127th Baluchis are endeavourin ; to get rid of their Baluch company, who are mostly Laaharis frorn the 'aohi plains lying to the west of the line of railway between Slbi and Jacobabad* 'liese men, if any. Inhabit a country that, in point of temperature rsse blec * asqat find the opportunity of transferring a com pany of trained men, en bloc, seems tOsgood to be lost* I would sucsest that tlie Political Agent be authorised to address the Officer Com anding the 107th Baluchis on the subject, v *o that they may exa in© together the fe«? -1bility of this proposal. Oomoany rdrjtit well be formed f thia materi l# Recent proposed developments at Ohohbar inclinr me t the belief tLat some political advant' g© mi^ht ancru© from the enlistmentenlistment of Baluchis frora the Perso-Malcran country. I do not altogether favour the proposal to enlist a precisely similar class of men from the 'Oman littoral as I think that the immediate result would b© a number of aprjlications from the many persons who have been kidnapped into slavery there. However desirable the freeing of these men may be from their arab owners, the formation of the new Corps should not be hampered by any considerations of this Icind, and we do not want bogus complaints, imDossible to prove or disprove, of theft against the new recruits by their arab owners# If, on the other hand, the Commandant or Adjutant of the new Corps were placed in touch with the proposed Political Assistant Chahbar, they would be able to approach men like Islam Khan, Mir Barkat and Baiyid Khan of Gaih and other Baluch chiefs of that part of the couhtry with not unwelcome- proposals and the enlistment of these quondam arms runners would tend to extend our political influence in the district and, to however xa modest a degree, pacify the country. Company (b) might, I think, therefore be recruited from iakranis preferably from Perso-Hakran• Company (c) while very desirable, will be the most difficult to raise and train. Somalis could, no doubt, be found in considerable number# to judge from the alacrity with which these men enlist on board His Majesty's ships. But it would be a far greater success if we could enlist the good offi ces of the 'Omani ShalJfchs and procure townsmen, not, I thinit. Bedouin, from the interior. Th© primary difficulties will be formidable but the arab is intelligent and adaptable add should, in the end, do well* I doubt however if a melange of Somalis and Arabs would prosper and one element would, I think, absorb the other in time.

The question of the esta'DliBhment of a Levy Corps for i &gt;lascat ia f t present confronted with difficulties which die not exiat when the Scheme was ori^inrlly sul»Kitted. On the one hand it ia novy- moat deairafele that the British garr- -ison,at present held up for the protection of Mascat,should be released as speedily j s possible ; on the other,owing to recent conditions developments/are generally unfavourable to the early introduct- a. ion of viw* Scheme which woulri have enabled us to substitute an efficient 'body of irregulfjr troops to replace the present garr ison. Go lon^,therefore,as an efficient substitute cannot fee found,the retention of the present British garrison must,it seems,continue. At the same time there would seem to be no reason why,if the difficulties with re ^«rd to expenses and the provision of Brit ish officers can he overcome (vide para 2), the Scheme should not t-e launched forthwith, 2, The points raised by the Government of India are as follows an&lt;; I will deal with them in oreier (i) Stren^t h of Corp£,' The military authorities consider the p- proposed strength of 500 insufficient for replacing regular troops. They recommend 500; 'but the cost of 500 would probately be prohibitive n . ^ apart from the question of cost) The decisior/as to what strength will be sufficient to replace the re^ylar troops must,I think,depend on two main considerat ions vis, (a) wlutkjtx whether ve are to legislate for normal local condit ions such as existed before the submission of the Levy Corps Scheme ; or for abnormal conditions such as have characterized the local situation during the past few months, In the former case ±JUixi|**x±±*Mx»jexK*x^, 300 men would be suff icient, while in the latter even 500 irregular troops would,II venture t© think,scarcely be enough to take the place of the iC.OO regular trtiojas which new constitute the Maecat ^arri non* In the former case the question of cost coes not call for discus sion. n nowerer,in view of recent experience, it is considered I necessary to be ore^ared for a continuance of afenemal conditions j and therefore to increase the proposed strength to 500,the quest- expense ion of/becoraes a more serieas one.as y ,ill fee seen 'by the follow- j i^g calculations;- The cost of an additional 200 aien would coiDe approxiinately to Rs 59. 5 00/ annually under * Annual and Recurring expenditure* 1 ,and Rs 16 j &amp;00/ under 'Initial 3wc^enditure ,,, , giving a total cost for D00 men of Rs 2. 00 . 00 0 under Annual Fn^ Rs 53.400/ under Initiw-l Expenditure approximately. ^iie Sultan is prepared definitely to surrender the Zanzibar sulj- si^y (Rs86,400) towards the annual upkeep of the corps. He could nG Pt- L am sure,afford, to contribute more. If the suiasidy were accepted, the balance payable fey Governwent would he R b 1 1 1$600/ 'r annually. The question remains whether so large &amp; siua would be considered prohibitive hy Governwent or whether its payment would not prove to oe less expensive than the maintenance of a British garrison at Mascat# (to) the second consideration which/influence the decision regard- in^ the strength of the new Corps is the fact that negotiations are now being set on foot with a vie% to bringing about an amicab -le settlesient between the Sultan and the rebels -the British Government .represented by the P .A.Mascat, acting a.8 intermediary.'. It is too soon yet to offer an opinion as to what the outcome of these negotiations will ©e ; but shoulel they prove successful the) ) to 500 the question ©f increasing the strength of the Corps/need no/t be considered; tor under such favourable circumstances,300 men/soMiijt be sufficient for the maintenance of His Highness 1 authority in the interior and for the protection of Llascat. His Highness is of eoinion that under sich circumstances,100 men would be ample. The negotiations will doubtless be protracted ; but,in view ^f the fact that they involre the introduction of a system of fixed txz.- Mai sllowancws for the tribal chiefs {vide your telegram Ko.192 of w .th February) which,it sufficiently large may prove attractive,ve may perhaps reftsftnafciy anticl|»^te tiiei t /, ultimate succese or, in any oase.ti permanent faBli»rntl»n of existin e conditl ane, thus eliminating frora the Bituation the firaunda upon which at/ present an increase t« the ori 6 lnally preposed strength at the Corps has been c®n8is.ered necessary* (20.

In this connection I woulii invite a reference to the lat'te^o?' Colonel Knox 1 e telegrwia a© # 32C of 7th.February 191&amp; on the subjed of the necessity of providing an Assistant for the Political Ag ent ^ascat in connec tl^V v.ith the negotiations mentioned in the preceding paragraph. (5) Attitude ©f the Sultan end whether he is definitely prepared to surrender the Zanzibar subsidy. I do not think that His Highness * attitude can be described as lukewara 1 . His Highness has always shewn a keen desire to see Corps the Levy/Scheme introduced, and a farther conversation I have just had with him on the subject confirms this view. At the same time his Highness has always expressed some anxiety regarding the c of the new 6orps and has/ invariably asked that its strength an. ^ cost may be kept as low as possible,compatible with the duties tti^t tne corps will be called upon to perform. The Schein» with its estimates has never yet been shewn in detail to His Highness; out he has definitely informed me that fcU though his other expen ds are extremely hea Vy ^ the 8urrender of the whole Gf the ^ zlfcar subsidy ^uld^inconvenient. yet he would be prepared to de- vote it to the payment of the Corps. His Highness is froa all accounts still much in del*. The cheaue4 - foT which v*e g^iYe te him monthly on account of hi a two sutoslilieB is at once handed over to a wealthy Aral® in MascatC Sayad Yusuf Zawawi) who,it is generally known,receives it in liquidation of of the debt which His Highness owes him. The surrender,therefore,of one of the subsidies to Government w®uld not only fmrther increase Hie Hit^hneBe* financial embarr- k ■ H i : j cements leut it would ©Iso probably lead to more frequent a;p?&gt;lic- : ations for loans to tide over pressing difficulties. It cannot therefore truly lee said that His Highness can afford to devote the subsidy to the expenses of the new Corps. On the other hand,with the estsblishment of the new co3ii&gt;s,the plea on which loans heve hitherto 'been applied for by His ^igh- nness -viz # for the payment of rifles,ammunition and friendly tribesmen employed in connection with the suppression of local unrest, would no longer hold good and we might therefore anti cipate their discontinuance on that score. (4) Desirability or otherwise of pushing through the Scheme forthwith. This question has been dealt with in para.l. To postpone the introduction of the Scheme will involve the continued retention of regular troops in Mascat, which it is our object to try and avoid* (&amp;) Grant of a subsidy to the Sultan to raise a force mt kix for himself. I venture to submit that such a course would be so much waste of | money. 1 very much ooubt if Hi^ Highness could enlist a single man except by force, A conscript corps would be doomed to I failure from the start,while it would also be a most unreliabl e oody of men. During the past few months Kis Highress has beo n endeavouring to ra.ise a 'Palace Guard 1 * for himself. With the greatest difficulty he has succeeded in forcibly enlisting about 50 recruits. Desertions are common and His Highness has made himself far from popular by this forcible xk±* enlist ment. The men are wotthless fot anything but ceremonial pur poses. 3* Another alternative to the proposed increase in the ' r8. strength of the corps and one v/hich might coaunend itself t© Govern, ment as Teeing probably less expensive than the aciditionidt of 200 men suggests itself. This woulel toe to attach (on loan if necess ary) a couple of Mountain liattery Guns -not necessarily of modern pattern— to the 300 Levy Corps, The Officer Corarnanding the Troops at Mascat has ncore than once asked for two such guns end I under stand that expert military opinion is unanimous in the view that the xxkxxxm * presence of 2 such guns in a c country like this would! very greatly simplify the difficult problem of protecting the tv/o weak points in the Mascat defensive arc -visits flanks- which have always been a source of very considerable anxiety to the milttary Coxaiaanders at uascat. The moral effect would be enormous. 300 Infantry and 2 guns should ensure the security of l ^ascat and in Matrah sgxinst almost any emr^ency,while the presence of artillery v/oald assuredly act as a very strong deterrent*^, any attempts of the rebellious tribesmen to again take the offensive.

The questien #f the establishment of a Levy Corps for ^ascat is at present confronted with difficulties which did not exist when the Scheaae was originally sulmittei.

With reference to your telegram Tfo. 777 3.dated 9th.April 1915 I submit herewith a Lote embodying my views on the joints raised in Foreign Departments Telegram jso .396 3.dated 8th.April 1913.January 10th 19 irlKMnr^ ^ ThanK^ for your letter of Deceraber 20th,and for your forethought in wiring to Loch* I was very glad of a fresh supxjly at Bahrain. I have not made any coraynent on your last letter to Foreign about the Muscat proposals. As you have so recently dis - cussed them personally,and I have no personal experience of Mus - cat,I did not feel called upon to say anything to Foreign unless directed. I certainly think the Gustoss business should be pro ceeded with at once. I ara,personally,considerably more doubtful of the advisability of the levy proposal,not so much for local reasons,though I see objections there too,as from the poin^ of view of its bearing on the general Arabian question. If we must back the present man, and I see no alternative, I can 1 &gt;■ help think ing that the formation of a levy of Baluchis under British ajettnn officers is an unsatisfactory way of doing it. Surely it must tend to aggravate Arab hostility to the Sultan ? Ana in any L.B.H,Haworth, J. A. j Political Agent, Muscat•f ; ^ ( any case,from the wider point of view,I should be afraid that such action at the present time might be presented by interested persons to the King of the Hejaz and to Bin Saud as an indication of our true policy towards all Muslim states,which might put them off a bit. I have suggested this point of view to Cox,as I thought it ought to be borne in mind that the matter is not of purely local importance. If he thinks Oman is sufficiently distinct,and dis - tant,frora the rest of Arabia for this consideration to have no great weight,he will doubtless do nothing in the matter. You will Jti jte - • of course say,very justifiably,that if I crab your proposal it's 1 • ■ p?y business to suggest something better. I should 0 answer to ■ j- that in the first place that your original proposal to bring the rebels to reason by a blockade seems to me preferable,and in the second that I do^t finally reject the proposal,but think it diouXd :ec only be tried as a last resort, and afte r some action had been taken : by you with the object of reassuring Shaikh Isa and his following as to the disinterestedness of our intentions. I mean that you should certainly see Isa first,and try and make some terms between i ; him and the Sultan,dealing with him exactly on the lines of your proposed letter,sent with your 90~C of last year* I have read the ^ latter with great interest,and I can't help thinking that your . proposed remedy is a bit inconsistent with your diagnosis of the disease. In the latter you lay considerable stress on the justi - i o*. fiableness from their point of view of the rebels 1 proceedings and the necessity of combining with our support of the Sultan a ' ( considerable degree of forbearance towards the rebeis,and considerat- r Ion of their point of view. However^,as I said above,I sha'njt put ray oar in to ?oy*o5.gn unless called ^ upon, and I don^t know what SiB Percy will shink. He may well consider my anticipations farfetched. i This is a long and rather disjointed letter,but I wanted rou to have my point of view,and I should rather like to have your0 ideas on the point,how to put in a certain degree of conciliato- riness into your attitude towards the rebels, after the levy pro posal has become known.J anu a ry 2 3 r 6 91 f l U Many thanks for your Jj/o letter of the 10th instant r* ^ar^iiw ij jrcop usj ].s \ i : : refere-ice to C.aan.

Bray also noted the point. On i y originally broaching the subject wltVi t'le Sultan I pointed out to him the necessity of esw&gt;loylng ArpSw for political reasons. I think however that there is little doubt that he could not rely upon Arabs for the purpose- they would not fight against the Imam whether they were supporting the Sultan or not. I was also disposed to accept the idea of the original Members of the force being Baluchis since most o ; them know Hindustani and could thus be easily trained - it woui be doubtful whether Arabic speaking officers would be available. It is also to be remeMbe ;-ed that Baluch levies have been used in I 'uscat for uany genereattons and t/ue forts guarding lue harbours' are a.t the present moment in Baluch occupation# The Arabs would not be so averse to the instit ution of a Levy Corps as to the control of the Customs,wnich is understandable.

As long as this xorce consists of a regiment of the Indian Army the Sultan is a mere dummy whom we support an-' whom we may continue to support. 8. As I have already pointed out for him to speak with any weight he must have some force of his own which will outcast our garrison. This he does not possess and I have at emp-eo to show that he has neither the money nor the men to proauce 1 what is required, o.

L * iL-: ■' *mMSKei ^ Political Agent Iluscat To the Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushlre Sir I have the honour to state that I recently understood from Sir Percy Cox that no present action is likely to be / taken on my letter N0.3/-T dated 30th October 1917, in which I made suggestions for the establishment of a Levy Corps for the purpose of maintaining law and order in the dominions of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat. 2. It is»I gather*partly owing to the difficulty of providing the necessary officers and partly owing to the general uncertainty regarding the future of this part of the world that the measures which I recommended have been post poned f 3. It hasboccurred to me however that it will be possible to provide the nucleus of the force,which will un doubtedly be necessary in the future, without any organisation or arrangements beyond those already in force and at the same time to assist in meeting the recruiting difficulty which exists^ v\&gt;.Ctv - 4. I would suggest that, instead of sending fresh drafts to replace the casualties which occur owing to sick- ness,local men should be enlisted with a view to forming one or if necessary two local companies.5. These local companies could be handed over from one battalion to the next relieving it and on our finally removing our troops from Oman could be handed over bodily to form the corps of Levies. As time went on officers could be draftedb per manently to these companies, when the removal of the Indian troops came within the range of practical politics. The men could be enlisted for three years, with a clause enabling us to terminate the contract at six months notice, and would otherwise be treated on the same terms as our own troops, while employed by us except that they would not be eligible for pension. 5. The above scheme is simple and vrtiile freeing recruits enlisted in India to be sent to other battalions would solve the difficulty of training a Levy Corps without involving expenditure in any way in excess of that at present entertained, 7, Whatever the solution of the Oman question may be a local force will in course of time be required and should it entail^ as appears probable if nothing is done in advanee- the retention here of a regiment while the force is oeing made, expenditure by the Indian Government of some 6 or 7 lakhs of rupees will be involved apart from the v^aste o^ man power. This expenditure is unnecessary and will be avoided by the plan which I suggest. 8&lt; * flopies of this letter are being sent to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department and to Sir Percy Cox direct.

Sir I have the honour to invite your attention to tue sub- k ^ { Ject of a levy corps for the Muscat State. I will be remem ber el taat this question has bf=en unler discussion for many years, ani its formation has been one ol the conditions of the /loan. Its actual inception has throughout however depended on two important factors, the ability of the State t pay for such an institution and the possibility of tae withdrawal of J- tie British regiment at Bait al FalJ. TY ioa J i it is impossible to s^eak witii any certainty ot ff s'the situation in tae interior of Oman,yet from all reports it seems to be true that tae Omanis having suffered what has been virtually a blockade for seven years during wnich time the v have received neither arms nor a^imuniti &gt;n^have to a very jreat d •; ree list their offensive power. At the sane timw of the regiment trie early withdrawal/is envisaged• Our present policy^ and trie only possible policy,is to make the Sultan's ^overn .ent ef« ficient and strm^,above all in the eyes of tae Omanis, It is &lt;/ necessary to provide for the defence ci . and from a possible raid. Attacks on the coast can always be d alt vv' th by one of H.-I's suips lose -rei -ice ! .s usually quite sufficient to discourage any a -ttem &gt;t by the trues the Interior.

Mo It will enhance the Bui tan' s prestige, will save Go em- ment the upkeep of a regiment and free it from considerable embarraasment• I do not ropse here to consiier the various schemes that have been put up previously on th s subject. The condi tions of Tuscat are peculiar. The essentia s of a levy corps in an Arab State are (1} That it s lould not be Arab ('!) Tixat it should be very highly paid (3) That it should be small and mobile 44) That the State should be able to afford it. (1) needs no explanation to anyone who has had even elementary experience of the Arab or who has studied the recent history of the Hejaz f to say nothing of Oman whose tribes are the most notoriously treacherous in Arabia. (3) is peculiarly apilicable to 'uscat where conditions of life are the reverse of pleasant. (3} is essential as the levy must be in a position to inflict sudden punishment in a short space of time. In )ther words what is wanted is a small .i^hly : 1 ami well-trained and loyal body of cut-throat mercenaries v 'ith no ties in the c &gt;untry in which taey serve,and no love f j&gt;r the Arab. It is no use blinki-ij ta s f^ct. For these reasons I subiait txie following p^ iposals. (1) A Baluch levy to be formed as a permanent force for the Muscat state. (3j Thli l«vy to be recruited in Baluchistan, if possible through the kind offices of the Hon'ble the Agent to the Governor General* (3) Personnel required. 1 Commandant Native Baluch offleer.Pay Rfi .300/- 1 Adjutant ' ' M ?*/ Rs.200/ -p.m. 3 Jemadars !!

Sultan's Government for certain period say 6 months or one year to organize corps and give it a start, ' as you know there is nothing new in employment of Baluchis in Oman or elsewhere in Gulf; Sultans have had Ealuch Askars and tupc is as garrisons for their forts for 3?-ears and Turks and Shaikh of Mohammerah always employed considerable numbers &amp;£ as ni~ht police chowkidarE etc at Basrah and Mohammerah respectively. Baluchis in Oman are nearly all Mekranis and Kejis and I think that if they can be spared certain number of N,C,0s and men from Mekran Levy Corps might if they volunteer be transferred to form nucleus of Muscat Levy Corps, or failing these perhaps ex Levy Corps sepoys who are not too old might be enlisted through good offices of Commandant of the Corps, ^erhaps Subadar or Subadar-Major of one of Baluch battalions who is eligible for pension could-be engaged\^) engaged as Coimnandantr. i Great care would iiave to be taken to secure thoroughly reliable man as eventually he v/ould be one. of most po'.Terful men in State. There would have to be a jemadar in charge 01 the guns and it would be necessary to get suitable man, possibly one about to take pension, from mountain battery, A.s the formation of corps would result in reduction of wing of regiment nov in Oman and as no doubt plenty of surplus stock available I think Government mi, o ;ht well make present of the guns and arms and ammunition and equipment.

Extract from Iemi-Official letter from Political Agent Muscat to Deputy Political Resident, Bushire. Dated 22nd May 1920. x / x X Two men and a boy with a machine gun and a few rounds of decent ammunition could hold the whole of Oman at bay. In fact I go so far as to say that with 250 reliable men, two machine guns and one mountain gun I could take tha wadis Semail and Muawal for the Sultan without the loss of a man. He does not want any more, and as these contain the the disputed gardens the problem would be solved. That is the reason I am so keen on getting this foreign levy goinp; as soon as possi- -ble as they can do the trick at once. At present the sultan has not got a single soldier upon whom he can rely. Gould has wired suggesting to me that I may be able to get 500 ready trained armed and equipped men from the Seistan levy corps, as it is probable that this corps is going to come under reduction, this would be the very thing. Semail is only 5 hours from Sib, it could be taken at once and the fort could be held without difficulty by a permanent garrison of 50 of the levy and a few Baluchis. All Oman is quite prepared for something like this to happen and would come in at once if it did. ^s it would be Muscat Troops that would do it we should be quite all right. x Extract from the reply to above D.0.,from Deputy Political Resident,to Political Agent,Muscat. Dated 9th June 1920. x x x It will be a good thing if you can get your levy corps ready made en bloc from Seistan;I rather doubt these up coun try Baluchis or Brahuis (if the Seistan Corps in_ up country Baluchis) staying at muscat long -but perhaps they might come for a year or so while other men from the 'Garmsir M as i they call the coastal district (and rightly) in Persia.Niedormayer or one of the German swash-bucklers in persia during the war said he could go all through the country with 200 men and a couple of mountain guns, and (or some of his con- -freres) was as good as his word. x x xv .f&gt; ' 4 .

My proposals were merely tentative suggesting the line to go on. As the great necessity now 18 to get the men here as soon as possible I am not going to cavil at details. Actually what he proposes makes very little difference, and the monthly cost of 200 men with officers, rations etc will be less than Hs.15000/-. This the state can and must afford. I am now busy with the Wali making all arrangements for their reception and housing. They will 'be cantone1 at Watayah, which you may remember as the Sultan's jaunting box just beyond Bait-al-Falaj. Tiisi gives excellent officers quarters, and the O.C. is giving a alrge number of condemned tents which are the very thing. Huts etc are also being arranged. Watayah will keep them out of mischief, it is a very attractive place for this part of the world witn plenty : of water anl trees. It guaris the road from the Interior, helng / / just beyond our picket line, and it will enable the levy to train and work to a certain degree with our men.

My dear Gould With reference to your letter of the $th June No.1440, I have shown the correspondence to Heath who has put forward his remarks on the attached note. From conversation with Risaldar Kechi Khan, Heath hinks that there would be no difficulty in raising the requisite number of men and from ray short experience of him I think Kechi would be a suitable man for the post of Commandant or Assistant Commandant, as it would be preferable to designate the post. You are too well aquainted with the conditions here for me to venture any other remarks. Would communicate what you think necessary to Wingate and when, and if, the reduction here takes place, I could get into touch with him as regards details. Yours sincerely T.V.Brenan■r Muscat Levy Corns I have the following remarks to offer regarding the possib- -ilitles of recruiting men fc)r the above corps either entirely or partly from J:he Siatan Levy Corps. ^ Trie following statement which shows a comparison betwween tnegates of pay drawn by a Sistan camelry man when serving in anl out of the Sistan Oasis and the rates of pay which it is proposed to pay to tlve Kuscat levy will not it will be observed be sufficiently attractive to induce the Sistani Ballooch to go so far afield so long as he can enter- .tain nope a .of remaining on in the Sistan Levy corpse- vi Pay Seistan Pay Muse «,t Levy, In * E* Oasis Oasis d this tict Risaldar Major Krs, 600 *670* Srs.

As regards rations, when serving outside the oasis of Seistan the Seistan Levy is given a ration of MOOOaXjUffiXXXXK 2 lbs of Ata . It is suggested that a similar ration of Ata or part Ata and part, Rice should be given in Maskat. The grant of a ration of i lb meat and 2 oz. ighi would doubtless be an added inducement but it is recognised that it is important to keep the supply arrangements as simple as possible. It strikes ae as *o«t Important that the men should be allowed to remit at a fixed rate of exchange any money not drawn by them' in Muskat. It would be necessary to give facilities for making family remittances, this could probably be arranged through the Consular Office in Sistan* ItA$] i \ It is suggested that if the rate of exchange were fixed at Kre. 350/- to Ro 100/- the pay would be sufficiently attract- -ive as it stands, if sepoys were «iven a rise to the pay suggested for I/Naicks. In Sistan all camelry have to provide themselves with a camel. All ranks pay Krs 10 p.m. into the Chanda Fund and after verification of death of animal receive Krans 200 as compensation from this find. If they have to purchase another camel in the open market they pay not less than krs. 500 for it. Camel casualties are numerous . if therefore as it is presumed the men will not have to provide themselves with their remounts, there will be a distinct pecuniary advantage in service with the Muskat Levies, However, the lalooch will probably turn his bling e eye towards this advantage when weighing up the situation, So lo ng as the men are actually serving in the Sistan Levy Corps, I am certain there will not be nearly sufficient volunteers for Muskat, If disbandment of SMx three hundred of the Sistan Levy Corps ware now ordered I think it would be possible to obtain half the requisite number by the end of August ready for despatch, always provided that it were possible to sanction recommendations contained in para 1, 3. The following minor suggestions not affecting the financial aide are made:- t (a) That permission to send men out as N.C.O's be given (b) That the efficiency of the Corps would be increased if the following appointments were given to exHazara I.O^ and N,0,0*8 or other ex regular men who have be been instructors in the Sistan Levy Corps, JenuAdjt•, Hav, Major, 1 N,C,0, per 100 men. (c) That vthe first terra of service be reduced from five to three years, (d) That one period of two months leave during their first agreement would be preferable to 1 months leave per year after the first year's service. My reasons for suggestions (c) and (d) are that men are likely t© be shy of taking ^ on for 5 yearsyears and as it is intended to alloy; them to &lt;jo on leave, there will really be no hold on thero. My experience is that local men are seldom content with a month*9 leave which is too frequently overstayed in spite of severe penalties. Since writing the above I have interviewed Risaldar Kechi Khan who incidentally consider would be suit- -able for the post of Commandant and he is very confident that ^there will be no difficulty in obtaining volunteers provided (i (a) Provision as suggested is made for families (b) The rates of pay are slightly more favourable than those obtaining in S,L,C»(c) Rations are provided. The men would be very nervous about taking on unless it was patent that they would n not have to expend possibly a large proportion of their pay on necessaries, (d) the term of service is reduced. He is aljve to the advantage of having a certain number of trained instructors with the Qorj^s, I would suggest that if assistance is to be given to Political Officer Muskat at a definite and early date and at the same time assured employment is to be found for a considerable number of the Sistan Levy Corps it would be well to have all Levy Cavalry north of Shusp relieved of convoy duties. Troops so relieved could be employed at Hurmuk, Lutak laring and luniabad on duties at present carried out by camelry® It would then become possible to recruit for the Muskat Levy Corps forthwith. It would be advisable to grant men one month's leave at least before sending them away. As animals are not required to be taken, I consider men should be despatched via Karachi • A Jritish Officer could accompany them as far as Karachi, To march the men to Sundar Abbas would entail con8id4 able arrangements for transport at an unfavourable time of the year.Tele gram.Cole / From Political Muscat To Brenan Sistan repeated G-ouli Simla No.1625 dated 22/7 /20.

Please refer to your telegram No.1475 dated August 8th 1920. The export of the necessary arms and ammunition,to Muscat,for v the Levies is in the opinion of the Secretary of State barred by the Arms Traffic Convention in existing circumstances.He makes the following observations on this aspect of the case and the scheme generally. Begins. It appears that to enable the Sultan to obtain Arms that are required he must either first ;-Signify his readiness to adhere to the Convention.This would be to invite French attention to our proceedings and enable Sultan to import from France and U.S. A.but the restrictions of Art .VII., with which existing Vvarehouse rules can easily be made to comply^would perJiap prevent this, the effect of which will be inconvenient ..In any case under Art.V export would have to be reported. Or; Secondly:- Muscat must be partly a Protectorate which is open to objection. Or thirdly ;-Sultan,by withdrawing rifles or with Arms alreacy m Muscat State could supply his requirements if these are serviceable Or alternatively by taking over rifles of the British Detachment when it leaves Muscat. This latter wouia be open to criticism as a breach of the spirit of the Convention. In any case this course would not supply Mountain Guns or revolvers reouired. I woula like to hear your views before approaching the Foreign Office. I have no information as 1;o details of Levy Corps scheme that is' being a ' uj - i^nz-sT+iQ mi i mo d i ^ x ed f rom tha t pi opo s eci proposed, but unless it is muon muuxxxc^ . „ ^ _ _ -i i'i/-o/'-.v-i o i K'nox in 1914 I am somewhat doJ.btful by Colonel Benn and Colonel imox in -ex. as- to the possibilities of financing it from Muscat revenues, . as the cost estimated in 1914 was E ? .36,000 initial expenditure and nearly li Lakhs of E' recurring. This must be much increased ... T aVtrmi d therefore like to be reassured at the present time. I should, ineit-xuxo on this point.

No. 2105 0 Dated and received 19th October 1920. Please refer to Foreign telegram dated October 15th No.ll99-G. The best answer to the Financial questions involved is in my letter dated 12th October No.2054 at present in the post,sent to you and and Foreign. A balance of P. Lakhs is shown on the iuscat revenues this year and the balance at the end of next year ending September 30 1921 estimated at about r.6- Lakhs after providing nearly P ? .l Lakh for repayment of loan,F/'.BO, 000 for new motor-boat and marine service and nearly F:'.2 Lakhs for the levy. This latter includes initial P r x | J I expenditure of 50,000 and nine months recurring expenditure. Yearly cost of the scheme proposed-by me is much modified from Bonn's^ and adapted to present conditions will be less than 2 Lakhs. As regards the general auestion , change in the present situat- -ion in r uscat and Oman should be considered. In this conection please refer to my letter dated 14th October and letter dated. l'-th October. Firstly. There is peace with Oman. Secondly. I am trying to bring about Arab state of self Government ,except in so far as the advice of the Political Agent on certain points in accordance with agreements must be taken. Thirdly. The moment is approaching when we should withdraw from our absurd position in Muscat, ine State,with little direction can pay for itself and its defence which we are providing at great expense,and getting no return. B'ourthly. The position of the Sultan whose one idea is an easy life and the fact that Government Council rules (by alteration). Fifth.We are in charge of American Interests and the French are withdrawing French Consulate. As regards importation of Arms into Muscat for State purposes. v and .«rt. X of the Convention seems to Muscat has an Arms uarehouse ana . grant permission to State as Sovereign independent to import subject to adhesion to Convention and certain formalities.The rGquest lia.s to come j ron th.© state itself and there is no reason to bb i . . that this v /ill be misused in view of the present state of affairs.

Telegram Ho.2105 from Political ^gent and letters to which he refers dispose of the Financial aspect of the establishment of a Levy Corps in Muscat. I think there is no doubt that the St.ate Exchequer can stand expense of the modest Levy Corps proposed by ingate. Regarding the other aspects of the question raised in the Secret- -ary of States telegram. Except in the unlikely event of Trance add America admitting that uscat is under British Protection or mandate it seems to me that the Sultan of 'uscat must sooner or later signify his adherence to the Convention.The existence of an Independent Stat© in the prohibited area..v-hiCii o bnoi \vi t t. wcu-^c. be the case,is an anomally. Perhaps the importation of Mountain Guns could be deferred until Sultan has done this. I understand that H.Vadala the new French Consul at Bombay formerly French Vice-Consul here,will shortly visit 'uscat to wind up affairs of the Consulate and French Coal Depot there. Anything we do in connection with the Levy will excite his comment after he has done this and gone, when presumably there will be no French or raerican representative in the place.

For a whole year in wnich replacements ef elethlng etc have to be supplied the expenditure is estimated at Rs,218000/11. It really should not be as much as that as the salary list includes the pay of a B.C. who will not be there. On the other hand tne numbers may be increased and I have made no allowance for the journey expenses of those going on leave beyond 'miscellaneous '. (2) What about the Indian regiment ? The whole point of having tnis levy is that that we should be ab^e to do without our own regiment. I certainly think that arrangements should be made, if all gees well to juftjoutK send away our regiment not immediately on the arrival of the levy but three months later, say at the end of June, I am not such a fool to say that I am sure that it will be all right, but at present it looks as if it would be, and in any case we certainly ought to try i^, (3) This again raises the question of the location of the levies. Obviously tne best place for them to be put is at 0 rB&amp;it -al-i? alaj wnere the troops gtre at nreaent, wli«n the latter bo • iaere Is a lar^e fort which is the present mess and officers quarters, and excellent pucca barracks capable of accomodating mich more than the present proposed levies. The levies could ^o into this en bloc when the troops g®. Of course I do not know what Government will do about the money they have spent on all these things, I imagine all they actually can do is to hand the whole tiling over to the Sultan's government as they cannot claim a penny from the Sultan's government from them and of course it would cost far more than they are worth to remove them to India. There will however be an anormous amount to do saving what money is possible to Government, so I think if you agree to the principle, that Government ought to be approached at once. Incidentally there is an excellent electric light plant and engine wnich might be taken over by us for the Consulate and offices* Till then I am arranging to put the levies in Watayah, where we can make temporary arrangements with tents and huts. The native officers can use the Sultan's house there and the B.O. can live with the Indian regiment which is only a mile and a half off. But the exact arrangements to be made of course largely depend on whether I know for certain that the regiment will be leaving in June ; they can then be of the most temporary kind, .Even then they will mean a lot of work on the part &lt;5f the O.C, troops and myself.

They shouli now arrive about the first week in April. The telegrams from the General Staff show that it is intenlel to 1 emove tne regular garrison kxx. as soon as possible after tne arrival of thelevies in Muscat, On the arrival of McCarthy I will consult with aim and the O.C.2/35th Sikns and wire you ani the General Staff an approximate late. The chief point to be consilerei in this is the question of taking over ani of tne disposal of surplus mate ial Tne levy corjjs are not a Britisn force ani therefore there is no question of handing over. They will simply go into the quarters formerly occupiel by the Indian troops, presumably J k C O V ^ i n 'f* strippei of most of the disposable articles. The Muscat in 1ii.e present period of financial stringency is quite unable to make any offer for the buildings erected for the troops which Government will have to make a present of to Muscat. In fact beyond the actual cost of the arms and equipment already indicated Muscat cannot pay an anna besides. It must therefore be very carefully consilerei by the military authorities what things tney can dispose of and whzt things they will simply nave to hand over as it will cost far more than tney are worth to remove them. The important question then for them to decide is whether they will leave tae Sikhs to io tuis or whether they ^ill leave an officer on special iuty with say fifty men to finish tilings up. My personal opini n is tnat tne Sikhs should io what they can arranging to leave with all tne transport etc some time in May, ani an officer should be left with fifty men to finish everytning up. The question of tne removal of the electric light Plant ani fittings will exk JE hate to be considered and an R.£,officer will nave r,o come froia Busaire or Karachi as soon aa possible for this purpose. Finally I am unier the impression that the General Staff nave qiite forgotten .he question of the Consular guardo This is twenty five men aril an Indian Officer. The levy corps 'being a Mascau j orce cannot supply this, ani even it it v/ere possible o ?,aivr; ^his -.eciinical objection wnich is of course impossible in allition to being highly inaivisable from the I political point of view, the levy corps nave not sufficient i men to supply it# •orderly I tnink this was always supplied once a inontn o. so irom one of the regiments stationed at ; Karachi • This point needs settlement, Cz/ti : ' ' 1 ' ' T P.A.Muscat,J. ■ I 65 aq^or ♦35/105 Teigram P.

Officer Commanding has already received authority to seM locally certain stores, 3, There are 8 temporary barracks in very bad condition, and improvements in Sultan of Muscat^ fort, which is present headquarters, I suggest these be given to him free for levies. 4, Officer Commanding therefore considers that 2/35th Sikhs will be ready to leave on the 1st June, In view of reasons set forth in paragraph 1, I hope departure will be sooner if possible.

I paid a short visit to liuscat on the 12th August, and inspected a sraali pf^otion of the Levy Corps who aeeaed saart and keen; I also saw the Indian officers of the Corps who iiapressed ae very favourably. I trust that the recoanendations a&amp;de in regard to thea by the Comandant \ - 1 ■ - ■ . :In the Baoond encloaure to the Political hmnt'a lattar Letter Uo*226/11* dat©ci 8th Septaraber Ju f oat ; Ccrp«, to' 3 nay b© broui ^ht to the I'olltioal Muscat, | tuo notioo ot Lh© ■ ill itary authorities, and thatth® latter will oonslder them favourably. ilfhat Ixapr^ss^d, iaa most, however, at my inspection was to reoofsnlse In a aiaart and well set up youn^ officer, Byed SJaliia, one of tlie Sultan's brothers whora I had last seen as a slacking, idle and &amp;ood for nothing youth. Other local Arabs have joined and Captain licOarthy see^s to be making good headway in training this very unpromising naterial* It is vary desirable that Mb services should remain at the disposal bf the liusoat utate so tliat he can continue this experinent. If he succseeds in tuxminis the local Arab into a mod soldier, it will save the State froia having to rely en foreii^iers for the force, fron the risk of the force being rendered inefficient by the foreigners not bein/t; able to stand '»ihe abomnable cliimte of lluscat, and last but not least from incurring extra expenditure in pay and allow ances and leave passages, in addition he will have achieved a feat which has hitherto been believed imposeibie by all those competent to form an opinion. 4. I consulted the Political hfient, Huscat about the proposal for Mouittaln Guns mentioned in the penultimate para of Captain ilcCarUiy's letter, and he has informed lae that it has been deoided not to press the question of the Mountain (iuno at present as the i&gt;tate finances could hardly bear the cost. I also enquired from Aden about ammunition for the hauser Machine guns and ascertained that none was available there. If some could be procured it would be a great thing as the Machine ^juns are of course useless without It, but I have not been able to obtain It from India, Mesopotamia or Aden, and have no idea where else I could perhaps obtain some. 5. In conclusion I beg tc endorse lir.

Letters discuss the proposed size, recruitment and composition of the force. Robert Arthur Benn, Political Agent Muscat, produced detailed budgets on the expenses involved in setting up the Muscat Levy Corps.Letters discuss how the British Government would meet the cost in the form of an additional subsidy and the remainder would be provided by the Muscat State out of the Zanzibar subsidy. Letters written in 1914 discuss how the Sultan of Muscat, Taimur bin Faisal [Taymūr bin Fayṣal], initially advertised for local people rather than accept a Levy scheme under British command; the English translation of this notice is included. Letters discuss British concern about the actions of Sultan Taimur. This was to allow the withdrawal of Indian troops garrisoning the towns of Muscat and Muttrah. The relative merits of an Arab or non-Arab military force are discussed.Includes a printed letter from Henry McMahon, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department to Major S.G.
