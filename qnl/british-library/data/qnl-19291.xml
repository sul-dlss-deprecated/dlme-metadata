The report (folios 47-48), written by the Bahrain Native Agent Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim] to Kemball, dated 8 April 1855, discusses an expedition by a relative of the chief of Koweit [Kuwait], against members of the Amaier tribe inhabiting the coast between Kuwait and Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf]. Jāsim reports that Abdullah bin Subah from Kuwait has arrived in Bahrain, having plundered a vessel and thirty sheep off. Jāsim describes his conversation with Abdullah bin Subah, who claims he stole the sheep in retaliation for theft committed against his people by the Amaier. Jāsim also reports on Shaikh Mahomed ben Khuleefa’s [Muḥammad bin Khalīfah] subsequent involvement in the discussions, and the sale of the sheep at Bahrain by Abdullah bin Subah.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x000018#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
