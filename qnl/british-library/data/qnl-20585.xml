(b) Ships within territorial waters should conform to the general regulations laid down by the States. (c) It is ccnsiaered that in JUecember,1925, wireless telegraphy between Bahrein end San Francisco would not have been impossible in the manner now contemplated but it is held that a telegraph concession is clearly not a radio concession, besides which the concession refers definitely to apparatus in the territory. (d) There is at Bahrein an ordinary commercial Vif/T coast station operated by the I. and .G. which can communicate with a w/T Station at a port where there is a cable; (Bushire or Hen^m). Ho reason is seen why the conpany should be allowed to communicate direct with San Francisco to the detriment of the I. and I.C. w/T and Cable services. 3.

May 10 f 1934. No# PA-76 His Britannic liajosty^s Political A^ont, Bahrein. Dear Sir: I am instructed by my Ccsapany to request that you advise Hie Excellency, Shaikh Hamad bin 'Isa Al Khalifah, of the following plans formulated, for the moasureioent of oil for royalty purposes# Ofce Conpany is now erecting the following tanks:- (a) 'fhree tanks on Sitra Island, two having a capacity of about 35,000 barrels each and one having a capacity of about 80,000 barrels, all for the storage and shipanBnt of oil, (b) A further tank on Sitra Island, being a iilge water (so-called) tank having a capacity of about 7,&amp;00 barrels, and (c) i'our tanks on the main Bahrein Island near to the ex perimental topping plant there, each of such tanks having a capacity of about 500 barrels* The unit 'barrel', as used in every case in this letter, coa- prises 42 gallons* The crude oil, as produced, will be flowed into tanks in the vicinity of the wells and thence through the gathering system to the oil tanks at Sitra and, when occasion demands, to the topping plant tanks. Ifce Oorapany contemplates paying royalty on the net crude oil run from the Sitra and topping plant tanks. Royalty-free oil for the Ootnpuny^B operationsis, of course, excepted frcm the foregoing. On the question of His Excellency the Shaikh having same means• £ • of ohockinr; tiia quantities eorjcerTicki, he will be especially interested in the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks# The Cowpany Is prepared to have these tanks measured by expert personnel now in Bahrein but if His 'accalloncy f?ould prefer to have the work done by !!essr3» and H. Redwood, which the Company understands is a leading British fix* with considerable experience In rnrious parts of the arid, the Conipaay Id prepared to engage that firm for the work* As the work imist be under taken without delay, perhaps Hie ^acoellency would be good enough to let the Cooipany know now whether the foregoing proposal to aaploy 'essro. B« and K, Redwood is one ha would like the Company to give effect to. It is proposed to have the tanks calibrated by outside measursments and to have tank tables prepared in barrels. The volurw of oil run f*om these tanks will be measured by the use of an accurate r ^teel tape. sampleB will be taken from the tanks at different levels • ordinarily the top, midile tmd bottom - and will be mixed in equal proportions prior to the gravity determination of the oil. Hie gravity of the oil will br cor- tained at any convenient temperature by the use of an American Petroleum Institute gravity hydrometer and as so ascertained will be converted to specific gravity, referred to water at 60 deBrees, ifehreaheit. Hie temperature of the samples tested will be taken iBsnedlately upon withdrawal from the tank by means of an accurate Fahrenheit thenaaaetv r f in order to obtain one of the necessary fact or r for correcting the measured volume of oil to what it would be at 60 degrees, Fahrenheit. Tfcls will be done by the use of tables published in Circular 154 of the United States Bureau of tandards. The same Circular contains tables for converting the volume in barrels into English tons which will be done for the purpose of the royalty computations.In order to d «tenalri© tho amount of water and foreign subetanoee for allowable doduoticmB In royalty caloulatione t the Company propoaep to use the moat generally adopted method, namely, that known ae the Centrifuge Method. Another oonslderation which will haye acme bearing on the question of royalty payments le the submarine loading line nov? being install ed by the Company, The Corapany also proposes usually to keep oil in thie line, rather than to dinplaoe the oil with salt water after eaoh run from the tanks. In measuring oil run from the sitra tanks for royalty purposes, it will not be necessary, therefore, to make allowance for the amount of oil in the submarine line, except, of course, on those occasions when the oil may be displaced from the line for some particular reason* It might be mentioned here that the Company expects to equip the subnarine line with an automatic suction pump or pumps. I should add that in proposing the methods outlined above, the Company has been guided by the consideration of what ape not only accurate but also practicable and relatively simple methods. His 'xcellency will, no doubt, avail himself of his privilege to have the oil accounts verified for royalty purposes# In this connection I am directed to say that if His ISxcellency would care to exercise his right under the Concession of appointing a representative to verify the oil measuremente and accounts in connection with royalty payiaBnts, the Company would welcome such appointment. I am further advised that a letter, practically identical with this one, was presented to the India Office on May 7, 1934.• 4 ~ If any of these pointe are not entirely clear, I shall of oourse be pleased to dieouee them with you at your oonfenience# Yours Tery truly, '£• . ncE m f Chief Local R ©pre sentat ire, THK BiiHRBIN FKTROLEffll COMPANY, LIMITED,HH HHHI CONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, There are two of your letters to me which the Company instructs me now to answer; they are (a) your letter P.Z.1303/34 of the 28th February 1934 concerning Land Sites and (b) your letter P.Z.1304/34 dated the 26th February 1934 concerning the Refining of oil in Bahrain. I have to inform you that the Company a-ppreciates the kindly and gracious assistance accorded by His Excellency the Sheikh of Bahrain in allowing the Company to proceed with the necessary installations in Bahrain and Sitrah Islands in order to facilitate its work there and that such assistance will be taken fully into account by the Company in considering the changes which His Excellency wishes to have made in the Mining Lease. Here permit me to say that the practical co-operation v/hich has always existed between His Excellency and the Company leads the Company to believe that on the other hand His Excellency will not be unmindful of the fact that the Company has met the desires of His Excellency oy commencing its operations considerably in advance of the time required and in keeping consistently ahead of the requirements under the Concession. The efforts of the Company in this behali embrace the installations I refer to, without awaiting the grant of the Lease. T j . -4. t &gt; With/ Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.2. *.7ith regard to the question of the refining in Bahrain of the crude oil produced there. Although Mr. Skinner has pointed out in his letter to H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain of the 17th December 1933 that the Company is under no legal obligation to refine oil, the Company was then already giving very careful consideration to the possibilities for refining oil in Bahrain. As you are no doubt aware, the Company has recently installed a 'topping' plant at Bahrain for experimental purposes and in the hope of being able to supply its own needs. Obviously, therefore, the question of refining for local consumption must be postponed until after its practicability has been definitely determined by the results of the Company's experiments. In regard to the possibilities for refining oil in Bahrain for purposes of export to Countries outside Bahrain of the refined products of the crude oil, it is apparent that this question embraces one of the most important factors involved in producing oil and in finding markets for production and safeguarding those markets. The Company assumes that His Excellency has not considered his request from the angle of the reduction of output resulting as a consequence of the Company being bound by an obligation to refine in Bahrain oil for export abroad. Therefore, the Company desires that it should be explained to His Excellency that the outlet which must be established for the disposition of the products of the Company may demand crude oil alone or partly crude oil and partly refined products. This depends upon factors which cannot be controlled by any producing/(o) 33 3. producing company for any given period upon a given 'basis. To attempt to give any assurance that any particular proportion of the oil produced in Bahrain will be refined in Bahrain for export abroad would bind the Company in the face of continually uncertain and changeable world-wide market conditions, to a fixed programme which might well fatally hamper the Company in the disposal of its production. It would limit the Company's freedom of action unnecessarily and inadvisedly in a way which would seriously impair, if not destroy, the chances of a successful enterprise. Upon the quantity of crude oil produced, depends the revenue, beyond the minimum royalty revenue, to be derived by His Excellency from the exploitation 01 his oil fields. It follows logically, therefore, that an assurance of the kind referred tobould not be in the best interests either of His Excellency or of the Company. Moreover, it is reasonable to suppose that the foregoing considerations, affecting as they do the direct interests of His Excellency, the Subjects of His Excellency and the Company, must have been borne in mind at the time the terms of the Concession Agreement were settled, terms which, whilst referring to the powers of the Company to refine oil, avoid sedulously any attempt to impose upon the lessee such a hampering ^restriction as an obligation to refine the crude product. The Company has demonstrated that it is ever mindful of the welfare of His Excellency's Subjects and accordingly/(b) 4. accordingly His Excellency may rest assured that consistently always with sound business judgment every advantage will he taken hy the Company to increase the need for the local employment of His Excellency's Subjects, to increase the revenue of His Excellency's Government and to further the general welfare of the Bahrain Community. The Company already feels, with some pride, that owing to its initiative and energy, 'based upon the sympathetic encouragement of His Excellency and his Advisers it has already been found possible to employ a number 0- l His Excellency's Subjects. A letter couched in terms similar to the foregoing has been written under date the 16th April to His Excellency by Mr. E.A.Skinner through H.B .M 's Political Agent, Bahrain. I am. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)H.R. BALLANTTNE .Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. 2 7 APR India Office, Whitehall, London, S,W.l. Copy sent to.uO P.Z.2565/34. C OKFIDEITTIAL . ' INDIA OFFICE . Note of convers-ition v /ith Mr. Ballantyne on Tuesday, 17th Aoril . ' ' I had asked Mr. Ballantyne to call, so that I could inform him of the advice which v/as being given to the Sheikh on the Bahrein Petroleum Company's application to be allowed to use radio telephones, and explained that, as an adequate service operated by Imperial and International Communications Ltd, v/as already available, direct communication with San Francisco could not be permitted; that it would be necessary to maintain the three-mile limit, save to ihe extent that radio telephones might be used outside it between Sitra and the outer buoy to the extent specified in paragraphs 4 end 5 of Mr. Skinner's letter to the Political Agent, of 18th March, P.Z.39; that within the three-mile limit the Company might communicate with all tankers, whether or not belonging to or chartered by them, and that these two latter points would represent special concessions which we would expect the Company to bear in mind, 2, Mr, Ballantyne did not appear much concerned at the rejection of certain of the Company's demands, and was clearly satisfied with the approval which had been given to others, Ke mentioned in this connection that he hoped we should soon reach a point at which it would be unnecessary to emphasise that, the various respects in which the Sheikh was meeting them did in fact represent special concessions. The/rep 4 1 - p. - The Company felt that they were actively developing their concession on the right lines and that a certain amount of give and take was necessary, and while he himself appreciated the Sheikh 1 s point, a continual emphasis on the fact that a certain action represented a special concession on the part of the Sheikh tended to produce rather unfortunate reaction on his American principals. I said I trusted that vve should soon have reached a point at w ich the Compan3 r would have met us on our various outstanding desiderata and the necessity for emphasising these special concessions might be less great. Hefining . I referred to Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 16th April (copies circulated under P.Z.2543/34) and said that the Company did not appear to have made any very substantial advance to meet the Sheikh. I would communicate further with him on this subject after the advice of the expert technical authorities had been obtained. I might, however, say at this stage that, 7;hile their difficulties were no doubt real, it did seem very desirable that they should if possible give the Sheikh some indication that in certain circumstances (they could safeguard the position as much as they wished) they would be prepared to consider local refining. Mr. Ballantyae replied that he was advised that their difficulties in going substantially beyond what was said in his letter to me were very great. They did not really yet quite know where they stood. Y. r hile the results from certain bore-holes were available, it might well be that deeper boring would lead to a modification of them and it was much too early yet for them to commit themselves on a question such as this. 4/IS 3. rv A r X 4. Acquisition of land on Sitra, etc. Mr.Ballantyne said that the Canpany much appreciated the Sheikh's granting of their requests under this head, though they had rather felt that they v r ere entitled to his co-operation in the matter, as it was to the interest of both parties that the concession should 'be developed as rapidly as possible. 5. Checking of returns and method of measuring oil for ro yalty . Mr.Ballantyne said that he understood that seme further discussion had taken place on this subject between Colonel Loch and Mr.Skinner since the date of my letter to him of March, and that the Bahrein Goverament were now contemplating the maintenance of a whole-time inspector. He pranised a letter on the question generally which would set out the position. Amendments to Mining; Lease &gt; The Company were now in a position to let us have a reply on this point, which would incidentally cover the important question of canmercial exploitable quantity. A letter would reach us in the next couple of days. 7. Training of Bahreinis, etc. He had put the suggestion made to him at an earlier stage on this point to the Company, who were considering it sympathetically. He hoped in due course to let us know the result. 8. Lighting; and Buoying. Mr .Ballantyne had now received instructions from the Company and a letter would follow. They were of opinion that the three secondhand second class dumb buoys referred to in paragraph 4 of the Government of India's express letter of 6th March, F.17-K/ 33 (copies circulated under P.Z.1778/34 of 20th March) would meet the Company's needs. The real difficulty was the provision of the light buoy. The Government of India/@) . ^ 4, India had indicated in the letter in question that they had no light buoy or light float available. They had also emphasised that the completion of the whole scheme would depend on the date of the fixing of the light buoy. Could we assist in any way ? I said that if he would raise the matter in writing I would consult the Admiralty and see if they could help. Mr.Ballantyne expressed appreciation and added that no difficulty would arise on the expenditure as estimated in the Government of India's c onmunicati ons. Appointment and position of Company's mooring master . Mr.Ballantyne did not appear to have had previous information as to the appointment of a Mooring Master, reported in the Resident's despatch C/158 of 1st April, though he was aware that the Company were maintaining a harbour master. I said that it would, of course, be necessary that the consent of the Bahrein Government, who already had a port officer, should be obtained to this appointment, and that the mooring master and pilot would have to be subject to the authority of the Bahrein Government's port officer. I gathered that Mr.Ballantyne saw no difficulty on this point. J.G. LAITHWAITE, 20th April 1934.Q / P.Z.2565/34 INDIA OFFICE s uHITEH/lLL, S.W.I. 21st April 1934 Dear Mr. Ballantyne, I write to confirm our conversation of two or three days ago about the Bahrein radio-telephones, to say that the T' - .-vv-..•. ' % Sheikh has been advised to reply to the request put forward on behalf of the Company: (a) that as an adequate service operated by Imperial and International Communications Ltd. is already available, direct communication with San Francisco cannot be permitted. (b) that he is unable to relax the three mile limit imposed last January, save to the extent that the Mooring Master at Sitra may use radio-telephones between Sitra and the outer buoy (within the area recently surveyed on behalf of the Company by H .M.S. 'Ormonde' which includes the track which will be used by incoming ships) to the extent specified in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Mr. Skinner's letter to the Political Agent, P.A.39 dated 18th March. (c) that within the three mile limit the Company may, however, communicate with all tankers coming in to remove the Company's oil products, whether or not belonging to or chartered by them. 2. As I mentioned to you, it will, of course, be necessary to obtain the consent of the 'Bahrein Government to the appointment of a Mooring Master and Pilot, which was referred to in Mr. Skinner's letter quoted above, and the Mooring Master and Pilot would of course also have to be subject to the authority of the Bahrein Government's Port Officer.

It is understood from paragraph 7 of the said letter (last sentence) that the work could be commenced without delay. There is, however, the ouestion of the Light Buoy, which seems to be the key of the situation,and which does not appear to r' , be available from reserve (paragraph 3 of the said letter). It is suggested by the Company that it might be possible for the Admiralty to lend the Company a Light Buoy during the time the Company tai:es to procure a Light Buoy of its own. Perhaps the Tenda? 'Nearchus' has one which it could let the Company have for a time? Would you be good enough to have an enquiry made of the Admiralty, and let me know? t I am instructed that the Company is ^reeable to the annual cost of maintaining four Buoys (including cost for Light Buoy) at 280 per annum. It is assumed that maitenance includes raising, chipping and re-painting the Buoys (see paragraph 6 of said letter) With regard to mooring the Buoys, I do not know whether it can be arranged to have the work of mooring fitted in with the regular schedule of the Light Tenaer - this point is referred to/ G.^iithwaite,Esq., India Office, Whitehai1,S.W.1.z. r\. to in paragraph 5 of said letter. The Company is naturally anxious to get all the work completed as soon as possible now so perhaps you oo ulu also find out something about this for our guidance. Yours sincerely, (Sd.)

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, Morn fication of fining Lease. I have to refer to your letter P.Z. 7189/33 of the 11th November 1933 and the enclosed Schedule of amendments proposed to the Mining Lease. As a result of the consideration of these amendments, it has occurred to the Company that there are a few further emendations which might as well be brought forward to bring the Mining Lease into closer conformity with ordinary oil-field practice and to take the course suggested by you in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, the Company has set out the modifications of the Mining I^ase in a form which it thinks should be acceptable to all parties concerned. The Company has had prepared a composite document comprised of the original Schedule III to the Concession .Agreement of 2nd December 1925, as modified bv subsequent documents. Six prints of this composite form are enclosed herewith for your convenience. One of such iorms sho^/s the modification? I have referred to above. In sending you these modifications I think I should, as a lawyer, ada that I ao so without prejuaice to the right of the Company to take up the Lease in the lorm provided by Schedule III to the Concession Agreement. I have no doubt that modifications will ultimately be/be made to the Lease agreeable to everyone concerned but until that time arrives the Company should, I think, reserve itr ri dit to admit, in principle, tne alteration of its concession Agreement only by way of mutual arrangement. I shoula aad that there are quite a number of alterations of a verbal character which requirt to oe made. These are apparent from a perusal of the form: for example, there are references to ''Agreementinstead of to 'Lease', the 'Political i ^ent' might be formally referred to and there are a few unwanted capital letters ana punctuation marks. Yours sincerely, (,&gt;). H.B.

The li^ht buoy required by the company will need to be large and I understand that the Admiralty have none of sufficient size available and tiuit those they have would have to be reconditioned before they were fit for service. Captain iiidgell has suggested that there might be a buoy of the right size available at Basrah as the Port Trust have several light buoys which they look after, and he thinks that it might be worth while to consult Oolonel Ward* The Aamiralty ao not know whether the NfiARGHUS carries a spare. The experts here tell me triat the Gas Accu&amp;iulator Company, Beacon works, Brentfora, ivdaalesex, could probably produce a buoy to fit trie company's purpose very quickly. Anothet possibility is that Trinity House might have a spare buoy of suitable size; but the quickest solution would of course be tnat one shoula be sent from Basrah. Yours sincerely, .l.d* POWSLL.

I think you told me when we were talking about it, that you would have to consider whether the consent oi the Bahrain Government would or would not be necessary to the appointment of a Mooring Master and Pilot. I am afraid I did not understand from you then that it definitely would be. I was to find out and let you know what is a Mooring Master - I am told that a Mooring Master is a person trained in the difficult and delicate task of the mooring and loading of tankers, a highly skilled and specialised work.

As I explained to you, the Political Resident informed us recently that the Sheikh had expressed a definite preference for the aT-jpointment of a British subject as Chit .i. Local Representative and subsequently reported, after personal discussion of the matter with His Excellency, that the oheikh held to his view, which was shared by the remainder of the Ruling Family. The Resident, after consultation with the Political Agent, Bahrein, suggested that in these circumstances a possible course might be the appointment of a British subject from some local firm to fill the post and indicated that in their view Mr•Russell, the Bahrein Manager of the Mesopotamia -Persia Corporation, who are already landing agents for the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, would c e suitable. Arrangements could as a special case be made lor vhe Political Agent to discuss matters direct with the fieid Manager in the event of Mr»Russell s appointment. o» Anart from the fact that in the opinion of His Majesty 1 a Government it is desirable, in view of their special relations with the Sheikh, that the appointment of a Chief Local Representative or Acting Chief Local Representative should normally be filled bya British subject, it would clearly be most undesirable to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh in a matter such as this and would have an unfortunate effect on local public opinion, and His Majesty's Government trust/ H.R .Ballantyne Esq.., Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited, 19, Moorgate, E.C.trust in these circumstances that the Bahrein Petroleum Company will 'be able to let them have suggestions for the appointment of a British subject in due course- Yours, (ic. , (Sgd.)

BALLA1ITYHL, BAHRAIN PETROLEUM COKPABT, REGARDING ArPOINTiSNT OF CHIEF ts /&amp; LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE, ON 21® ..AY, 1934. &lt; * V The concurrence of the interested Departments having 'been obtained in action on the lines suggested yh the Political Resident's express letter of 3th April, No.G.193, I asked Mr, Ballantyne to call to discuss the position in regard to the Chief Local Representative. 2. I said to Mr. Ballantyne that as he would probably have inferred from previous informal discussions on this subject wo had ourselves, subject to any reports we should receive from the Gulf been rather inclined to think that the best solution might be as a special case, and with the proviso that in our view the Chief Local Representative ought normally to be a British subject, to confirm Mr. Skinner, but to require that the acting vacancy created by Mr, Skinner's forthcoming long leave should be filled by a British subject. The Political Resident had subsequently intimated that the Sheik, expressed a definite preference for a British subject, and after further personal discussion of the matter with His Excellency had now informed us that the Sheikh held to his view, which was ^ shared by the remainder of the ruling family. The Resident had '4L added that while Mr. Skinner was personally acceptable, it would clearly be most impolitic to force an American on the Sheikh and would have an unfortunate effect on local public opinion. He had suggested in these circumstances that nr. Russell of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation might be employed. Arrangements could as a special case, and by way of meeting the Company, be made for the Political Agent to discuss matters direct with the ♦ Fields/m Fields Manager whenever he thought fit, if Ivlr, Russell was appointed. 3, Mr, Ballantyne expressed great regret that difficulty was likely to arise over the confirmation of Mr. Skinner. He could not, of course, commit the Company, 'but prima fa cie he was not attracted 'by the proposal to employ Mr. Russell, It would 'be unsatisfactory from the Company's point of view to have a non-expert concerned with their business. Moreover, he had no information as to ivlr. Russell's standing and as to whether he would be acceptable to the Bahrein authorities, 4, I said that it might be assumed that the Resident had satisfied himself as to •dr, Russell before suggesting him. At the same time we appreciated the objections taken by Mr. Ballantyne, and the suggestion had been made with a view only to assisting the Company, The real solution was a British Chief Local Representative. If the Company would meet us over this they need not anticipate any difficulty in securing our concurrence in the Chief Local Representative doubling the duties of that post with those of some other post in the Company's organisation in Bahrein. 5, After considerable further discussion Mr. Ballantyne said that on the assumption (which I confirmed) that we 'vvere not prepared to dispense with the post of Chief Local Representative, he would at once report the position to the Company who would immediately consider his replacement; that he.had been under the impression that Mr. Skinner's leave vmD for six and not for twelve months (Bushire derni official letter c/134^dated 20th March 1934)^ that Mr. Skinner, so far as/9 # % as he was aware, was not due to leave Bahrein until July which would give two months in which to consider matters; that the Company might, if we saw no objection, possibly not find themselves in a position to suggest any replacement for Mr. Skinner for two or perhaps three months after he left Bahrein^ and that during the period of his leave they might suggest trying out one or two British subjects in the acting post of Chief Local Representative. Ke appreciated the importance of finding suitable British subjects, and it would clearly be necessary to get a man of the right type and in particular someone who would keep out of politics. A post could perhaps be found for him in the Company's organisation at Bahrein as Labour Master or the like. 6. I said that the Company were entitled under their Agreement to a reasonable delay in filling the post of Chief Local Representative though they would of course have two months between now and the date of Mr. Skinner's departure on leave: and that we would understand it in the circumstances if there was a slight gap between Mr. Skinner's departure on leave and the appointment of a successor. Three months, however, would be our outside limit. As he would remember from our discussions over Major Holmesj we had never contemplated that there should bo a gap in the appointment longer than two or three months in the year at the outside. 7. Mr. Ballantyne left with the impression that while the refusal to confirm Mr. Skinner would come as a shock to the Company who might not take it well, there was reason to hope that they would not be obstructive about arranging for his ultimate replacement by a British subject (possibly with a Briti sh/British understudy) and about conforming in future to our wish that a British subject only should hold this post.

Island, two having a capacity of about 85,000 barrels each, one having a capacity of about 80,000 barrels (all for the storage and shipment of oil) and a fourth tank (being a bilge water tank) having a capacity of about 7,500 barrels. It is also erecting four tanks on the main Bahrein Island near to the experimental topping plant there, each of such tanks having a capacity of about 500 barrels. The unit 'barrel', as -used in every case in this letter, comprises 42 U.S. gallons. The crude oil, as produced, will be flowed into tanks in the vicinity of the wells and thence through the gathering system to the oil tanks at Sitra and, when occasion demands # to the topping plant tanks. The Company contemplates paying royalty on the net crude oil run from the Sitra and operations is, of course, excepted from the foregoing. On the yuestion of His Excellency the Shaikh having some means of checking the quantities concerned, he will be The Company is now erecting fourtanks on Sitra topping plant tanks.

Laithwaite Esq.., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I especially/2, :'v * especially interested in the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks# The Company is prepared to have these tanks measured by expert personnel now in Bahrain but if His Excellency would prefer to have the work done by Messrs*B.and R.Redwood, which the Company understands is a leading British firm with considerable experience in various parts of the World, the Company is prepared to engage that firm for the work# As the work must be undertaken without delay, perhaps His Excellency would be good enough to let the Company know now whether the foregoing proposal to employ Messrs.B. and R« Redwood is one he would like the Company to give effect.to. It is proposed to have the tanks calibrated by outside measurements and to have tank tables prepared in barrels. The volume of oil run from these tanks will be measured by the use of an accurate steel tape. Samples will be taken from the tanks at different levels - ordinarily the top, middle and bottom - and will be mixed in equal proportions prior to the gravity determination of the oil. The gravity of the oil will be ascertained at any convenient temperature by the use of an American Petroleum Institute gravity hydrometer and as so ascertained will be converted to specific gravity, referred to water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit* The temperature of the samples tested will be taken immediately upon withdrawal from the tank by means of an accurate Fahrenheit thermometer, in order to obtain one of the necessary factors for correcting the measured volume of oil to what it would be at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. This will be done by the use of tables published in Circular 154 of the United States Bureau of Standards. The same Circular contains tables for converting the volume in barrels into English tons which will be done for the purpose of the royalty computations#In order to determine the amount of water and foreign substances for allowable deductions in royalty calculations, the Company proposes to use the most generally adopted method, namely, that known as the Centrifuge Method. Another consideration which will have some bearing on the question of royalty payments is the submarine loading line now being installed by the Company. The Company also proposes usually to keep oil in this line, rather than to displace the oil with salt water after each run from the tanks# In measuring oil run from the Sitra tanks for royalty purposes, it will not be necessary, therefore, to make allowance for the amount of oil in the submarine line, except, of course, on those occasions when the oil may be displaced from the line for some particular reason. It might be mentioned here that the Company expects to equip the ^ submarine line with an automatic suction pump or pumps. I should add that in proposing the methods outlined above, the Company has been guided by the consideration of what are not only accurate but also practicable and relatively simple methods. i His Excellency will, no doubt, avail himself of his privilege to have the oil accounts veritied for royalty purposes. In this connection I am directed to say that if His Excellency would care to exercise his right under the Concession of appointing a Representative to verily the oil measurements and accounts in connection with royaity pa^me^ts, the Company would welcome such appointment. If there is any further information you want you have, of course, only to let me know. A letter following the terms of this one will be written by the Company through its Chief Local Representative to His Excellency in the course of a few days. Yours, &lt;S:c., • (Sgd#) H .R.

Dear Starling, With reference to our conversation yesterday regarding the protection of the lessors' interests in connection with oil being won in Bahrein, I have to confirm the following:- (a) I have been in the Mines Department, Trinidad, for 23 years, the last 11 of which I was head of the department. (th} During that time it has been my duty to assess royalty on all oil won under Crown leases. (c) Since 1914 I have been Inspecting Officer for the Admiralty in respect of oil shipments and have been responsible for the measuring of every cargo lifted by t that department from Trinidad. In addition to the above, I have calibrated practically all the tanks in Trinidad from which the various oil companies supply their customers, and have on many occasions measured and tested bulk cargoes on behalf of both vendors and purchasers. If desired, I could visit Bahrein, calibrate all the tanks erected and furnish a report on the measures necessary to be taken to protect the lessors 1 interests in the assessment of royalty. Provided that all preparations had been made beforehand, I estimate that this should take 10 to 15 days on the field according to the ground to be covered. I would quote a reasonable fee, when the work » required to be done had been agreed upon, to include all certificates of calibration, report on the methods to be adopted in protecting the lessors' interests and any subsequent consultations in London, Yours faithfully (Sd.)

It appears that the Company to which the oil has been consigned is the Asano Bussan Kaisha. Their main office is at Tokyo, but they have an office at Yokohama. The firm is a big Japanese merchant concern similar to the Mitsui and Mi'tubishi, and has various engineering and other interests. It has no oil refinery, however, and, as a matter of fact, does not deal directly with oil, but ,it has been known to act as brokers for some of the Californian oil companies. It is possible that, in the present case, it is acting as the agent of the Standard Oil Company of California and will arrange for these five barrels of oil, which form what is known in the trade as a 'bulk sample', to be tested with a view to ascertaining the possibilities inherent in the Bahrein crude oil. This rather looks as if the Standard Oil Company of California is in touch with some Japanese oil company as a possible purchaser. If such is the case, the company would have to be capable of refining the crude oil. The three principal refining companies in Japan are the Nippon Oil Company, the Ogura Oil Company, and the Mitubishi Oil Company, the last named being a joint concern of the Japanese Mitubishi interests and the Associated J 6 ,G.

Y' &amp; &amp; I have your lettbr of the 8th instant regarding the measurement of oil for royklty purposes at Bahrein, and confirm that the calibration arrangements referred to in Ballantyne's letter of the 7th May are the result of an informal talk which I had with Hamilton on behalf of the Bahrein Pe t r o 1 eunjc ompany. I agree that the arrangements proposed may be regarded as generally satisfactory. With regard to the calibration of the Sitra and topping plant tanks referred to in paragraph 5 of Ballantyne's letter, I think the work should be done by an independent person as the ascertainment of the quantities of oil shipped or refined, and therefore the amount of royalty to be paid, will depend entirely on the calibration of these tanks and there should be no doubt or suspicion as to the correctness of the measurements and calculations made now. Messrs.B.&amp; P.* Redwood, who are mentioned by Mr.Ballantyne, are a well-known firm who have done considerable work for the Admiralty in the past, and we can say that they are a (^uite reputable firm. With reference to the proposals made in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, I think these maybe agreed to, subject to the concurrence of the independent person who takes on the work. I believe, as a matter of fact, that Hamilton has already discussed these points with Redwoods and has secured their J .G. Laithwaite Esq,., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1* informal/informal agreement. In regard to paragraph 9, respecting the submarine loading line, I think we may sal'ely agree to the Company keeping the line lull oi oil rather than of salt water* This is ^uite a general practice and retards to some extent the rapid erosion of the pipeline which takes place in tropical waters. One other point was raised by Hamilton when he saw me, and that was what arrangements the Company might 'be required to make for disposal of 'ballast water from tanks arriving in ballast. This water is often very dirty and contaminated with oil. In this country tankers are required to discharge this ballast water a considerable distance out at sea. This is a point which ought not to be lost sight of, as the discharge of dirty ballast near the coast of Bahrein might be detrimental to the pearl fisheries. Yours, &amp;c., (ogd. ) P.O.

I have the honour to refer to my letter No:C/402-10/l dated the 15th April 1934 to the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, regarding the desire of his Jompany to instal a private telephone line between Jabal Lukhan and Manamah, and to enclose a copy of his letter No: PA-78 dated the lEth May 1934. 2. it will be seen that the Chief Local Representative accepts conditions (a) and (b), subject to which the permission to construct the line was granted by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin T Isa Al Khalifah. 3. The Chief Local Representative, however, claims that the Company have the nrfit to construct the line, both under the Second Schedule and the Third Schedule. 4. As the Company nave not yet entered upon the Mining Lease, the question of any such right under the Third Schedule does not arise. 5. I do not know whether or not under standard oil practice trie instal lation oi such a telephone line would be regarded as covered by the existing prospecting license; or, for example, whether the boring of a series of 2,000* wells is /included I I ^2. included in prospecting. It seems to me that confusion has been caused by the tact that the Company are in truth carrying on many of the operations properly done under a fining Lease, while they are still working under their Prospecting License. 6. In view of the progress which is being made in the matter of alterations to the Mining Lease, it may be thought preferable not to press this matter. On the other hand, if it is still held that the construction of such a telephone line cannot be included in the phrase 'such works as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting', and if it is desirable further to impress on the Company their obligation to the Shaikh, a reply to the Chief Local Representative might be desirable. 7. I should be grateful if I might be furnished with instructions. 8. I would add that from conversation with the Chief Local representative I gather that the emphasis, which has been laid, in conveying the Shaikh T s permission in various matters, on the tact that tne Company have no right to do them under the Prospecting License has given them the idea that the Lritish resent their being here.

His Britaimlc Majeaty's Political Agent Bahrain Dear Sir: I haTe to refer to your letter No# 0/420-10/I.VII dated the 15th April 1934, referring to the installation of a private telephone line between Jebel Dukhan and Manama. As mentioned In our conversation of April 19th, the Gcapany has already been granted the right to construct telephone lines* That right exists under the Concession not only in the Second Schedule but in the Third Schedule as well* The first sentence of paragraph II of the Second Schedule, under which the Compeny is now working, reads: 'The right to carry out in any part of the said territory such work as may be necessary for the purpose of prospecting. * A telephone line is ordinarily one of the first installations made in connection with the drilling of a prospect well or wells. /hen our prospecting operations have reached such a stage that a telephone commu nication between the scene of actual operations and the port of Manoma where the materials are landed and the Ilanager resides will increase the efficiency and economy with dhlch they can be carried on, such an Installation becomes clearly 'necessary for the purpose of prospecting. w The condition mentioned under subparagraph (a) and the first condition In subparagraph (b) of your letter will, of course, be complied with. Referring to the second condition of subparagraph (b): W« shall, of course, be pleased to grant the Bahrein Government way-leave to run a line of their own on the Company 's posts should they desire to do so. Because of the rather great cost of the Company's installation it is assumed that some cctapensation would be returned for such grant, possibly In the form of a preferential exchange rate at Manama, or a set figure to be paid out of a prescribed portion of our exchange bills.

Ballantyne as^ed for an interview to discuss arrangements 4 in regard to lighting and buoying and the calibration of tanks at Bahrein. 2. As regards li^htinK and puoyin^. he said that the Company appreciated the great assistance which had he en given them hy the Indian autnorities ana dia not wish to press the matter unauly. But it was most important from their point of view to know with tne minimum of delay the position in regara to the light buoy, which was the key of the present position, and they would be grateful thereiore if a further reminder could be sent at their expense. I said tnis would be aone. 5. Calibration, etc . Mr. Ballantyne said that the Company's reply to our enquiry on this subject haa, he hoped, made the position clear. They were anxious to know as soon as possible where they stood, because it would be necessary, if there was unlikely to be any hitch, to send out instruments, etc. to Bahrein in the near future for use in connection with the checking of the measurements of the tanks. I said that the Petroleum Department had had no very material criticism to make of the arrangements suggested in his letter and that a telegram h^d been sent to tne Political Resident (repeated to Bahrein) on i5th Lay that the comments of tne Petroleum Department on the arrangements proposed by the Company would follow by the air mail of 18th Lay. Mr. Ballantyne said that this information/- 2 - information as to the action which h^u buan taKen in the matter woula be 01 value to the Company and was all that they wanted to know for the moment. 4. Mining Lease desiderata . I informed Air. Ballantyne that we hope a to he in a position to uiscuss next week the Company's reply on the question of our Lining Lease aesiaerata. I had not yet received the comments of trie Petroleum Department, but mi^nt pernaps mention that one of the most important points on vmich our requirements were unsatisfied appeared to be that of con'mercial exploitable quantity. He was aware of the importance attached to this point by the sheikn. 5. Mr. Ballantyne saia that he thought the Company had gone a long way to meet any reasonable demands on this question in their reply regarding the Sheikh's Lining Lease desiderata and that if they started production without further delay that was all that he could reasonably require. I said that I dia not think that that was the case and that, while any remarks I might make must be the regarded as wholly provisional pending receipt of/advice of the Petroleum Department, I doubted if tne advance represented by the amended Lease would really meet tne Sheikh's point. It was quite true that tne Sheikh, under the amended Lease would be entitled to a minimum royalty of its.50,000 throughout. But L.. Ballantyne would agree that that figure had been granted by the Company as consideration for an extension of the prospecting licence and was something quite separate from the payments which the sheikh might expect- to receive under tne Lining ^ease. The original Lease had contemplated a not unimportant increase in minimum royalty payments on the Lining Lease being/■ ! I I ■ . I 1 I ■ 'H) IM oeiiig taken out, dna thG Sheikh, now that the minimum payment auring the interim period was fixed at R3.30,000, might reasonably expect some advance on that figure on the Iwiiiing Ltase coming into operation. The figures which I suggested to him in one of our earlier interviews haa been a minimum annual payment on the basis of, sc .y, fts*30,000 for the first two years, Hs.60,000 for the next three years, ana Hs.100,000 thereafter. Mr. Ballantyne said he could not see what justification there was for tne making of a substantially higher payment to the Sheikh on the Mining Lease coming into operation. ^i replied that we understood that the Company were proposing to produce at the rate of 5,000 barrels a day from June or July of this year. If, in fact, they were to produce on a substantial scale, then, speaking personally, I was quite prepared to agree that the sheikh mi &amp; iit nave no very strong claim to a higner minimum rate oi royalty, since the royalties which he would receive conseQuent on such substantial production would be sufficiently consideraole to safeguard his interests. But the contingency which should not be overlooked (regarding tne matter from the point of view of tne Sheikh) was the possibility of the Company, for whatever reason, ceasing to produce on a really substantial scale. (Mr. Baliantyne interjected that there was no risk, so far as ne was aware, of the Company using Bahrein as a reserve oil field). It clearly would be of great importance to the Sheikh to safeguard himself against the risk ol this ty *•'' ' •.••••&lt;• securing a o-airly substantial minimum royalty. If, on the other hand, the Company had no intention of reaucing production/I* - 4 - proauction, then equally they ran no risk In agreeing to ^ minimuiu royalty figures oi the dmensions which I had. sugb^&amp;t/ed. 8. Mr. Ballantyne saia that it was, of course, the case tnat if tne bottom fell out of tne oil market altogether ana it was impossible for tne Company to dispose of more than a certain minimum amount of oil, the royalties would fall. Ihat equally was a consideration from their point of view in agreeing to any sucstantial minimum royalty. They might fina themselves committed to a minimum royalty of a very suostantial nature in respect of an oilfield which hau ceased to pay tnem. 9. I said that it was just for tnat reason that it was desirable to safeguard the sheikh's interests. We had no complaint to make of our dealings with the Company, which had been amicable on both sides, or of tne attitude which the Company had adopted in relation to oil questions. Looking bit the matter broadly, it appeared to us that there was not much in it from tne point of view of tne Company. They were already liable for a minimum royalty of l^s.SO,000; the maximum royalty whicn had been suggested - v. tCtfi to him at an earlier date was 5s. 1 lakh alter a number of ■ .v. - . _ ..... v .. ■ C.nu . years. The difference was at the maximum Rs.70,000, say £5,000. That, for a company of the standing of the Byiirein Petroleum Company, was not a very substantial risk J On the other hand, for someone like the sheikn of Bahrein it did present a quite substantial safeguard. 10. Mr. Ballantyne replied that the Company must consider its own interests and that the more he saw of this particular question the more he was impressed by the way in which thousands mounted up. At the same time he recognised the force of the argument. He also recognised that/- 5 - that anything that v\as now saia to hm was purely provisional in character, hut if on receipt of the advice of the expert Department we raised the point on the lines on which it haa just heen pressed on him, clearly the Company woula have to consider it further. He wished to emphasise, however, that the Lease did impose a definite hurden on the Company. The rate of royalty was very high; one point considered in connection with tne Lining Lease aesiderata haa heen whether the Company should not demand a revision aownwards in tne rate of the royalty after a period of, say, o years, or if circumstances changed. I said that we were advised that the rate of royalty, though generous^ was hy no means excessive and that it woula he unwise to hola out hope to him of the prohahility of any revision. 11. It was agreed that the matter should he discussed further on receipt of the aavice of the petroleum Department. J.G. LAI'IHWAIjE. 17th Ivay 1934.m % njt 7 P.Z.

A copy has been sent to — by Mail. 'Y s 2732• Memorandum 'by the Petroleum Department on Bahrein Draft Mining Lease enclcsed with Mr. Ballantyne's letter of 20th April, 1934 . Following an inter-departmental meeting held at the India Office on 27th September, 1933, to consider a memorandum by the Petroleum Department and discuss the proposed amendments, a schedule cf proposed amendments was sent to Mr. Ballantyne with a letter from the India Office dated 11th November, 1933. The Company has made an attempt to deal with each of the points mentioned in the schedule, and the extent to which the effort is regarded as satisfactory is indicated below in the comments on the new draft lease article by article. As regards the print upon which Mr. Ballantyne's amendments have been made, this has been compared with the original form of Mining Lease attached to the Agreement of 2nd December, 1925, and, except for the following, it is substantially the same. The differences consist of (i) the preamble, (ii) a provision relating to jurisdiction over foreigners on page 4 (Article V.), (iii) the measurement and accounts clauses, pages 5 and 6 (Article VII), {iv) British Control Clauses, pages 7 and 8 (Article XIY to XYI) and (v) the interpretation clause, page 8, (Article XXIII). Except for the first two these provisions are copied from the Agreements of 12th June, 1930, and 15th February, 1933. Preamble . No comment. Article I . Provision for erecting and maintaining boundary marks has been provided for as suggested by H.M.Government. Article II . A clause has now been inserted to cover provision for handing over wells and property on'expiry of agreement. The/(J?) - 2 - The warding is not quite the same as we suggested. We proposed that n all productive wells and borings shall 'be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working'. The new clause (Rider B page 2) says that 'all 'borings (including casing therein) which the Company has not abandoned shall be handed over in reasonably good order and repair'. In addition all immovable property is to be handed back to the Sheikh and he is to have the option to purchase all other propertj'' at replacement value, less depreciation. In the event of dispute the price is to be settled by Arbitration. It is suggested that the Article as revised can be accepted. /The old Article III , has beQi deleted. This provided for the pegrment of a lump sum of Bs.10,000 on signature of the lease and for the annual payment of a sum of Hs.10,000 for five years or until the Company declared that oil had been found in 'Commercially exploitable quantities'. This matter is discussed below on Articles VII and YIII^ Article III , Exemption from taxes and import duties . The original draft provided for exemption until two years after the Company declared that oil had been found in 'commercially exploitable quantities, or for a term of 10 years'. There may be some ambiguity as to the date from which the 10 years was intended to run, although it is submitted that H.K.Government would be justified in maintaining that it could only be from th date of the original agreement, viz. 2nd December, 1935. In the revised draft the reference to 'commercially exploitable quantities' has been deleted and exemption from taxes is proposed for a term of 10 years from the date of the mining lease. It can very well be argued from the fact that the Company is proposing this year to ship oil in substantial quantities/ —■SI )UquantitiGs, that oil has been discovered in n coITlmercially expl citable qu.antities' . In seekin; to secure exemption from taxes and customs duties for a prriod of 10 years from the date oi the lease the Cornpany appears to be trying to secure a substantial new concession. It is not suggested that this should necessarily be turned down, but it will be a useful counter in the bargaining on certain points where the Company has not yet met our desires. A rticle IY . ^he numbering ofthis Article has not been altered in the copy furnished to the Petroleum Department^/ The second paragraph has been redrafted (see Eider C page 3) and subject to the addition of the words 'arising in Bahrein' after the word 'cause' in line 2 of the new paragraph, this might be accepted. Article Y . No comment by the Petroleum Department. This article contains on page 4 the new paragraph as to jurisdiction over nbreigners to which reference is made above on page 1. Article YI . ITo comment by Petroleum Department. Articles VII and YIII . It will be convenient to discuss these two Articles together, as they' deal with the question of royalty payments. In these Articles, as revised, the Company has made provision intended to meet our requirements set out in A 2, ( measurement and accounts )» B (old Article III) ( royalty on all oil produced ), and B (old Article YIII) ( royalty on natural gas and casinghead gasolin e) of the schedule of amendments. The following comments arise on these points:- (a) Measurement ard Accounts : The clauses which have been inserted are those which were accepted in the Supplementary Agreement of 15th February, 1933, (b) Boyalt:/ - on all oil produced : The Petroleum Department suggested that the only oil which/0^ ;{,&gt; % y which should be exempt from royalty should be 'oil required as fuel ±or drilling purposes and for pumping to field storage'. This is the basis adopted in new regulations recently made in Trinidad. The Company adhere to the wording of the original agreement which gives exemption to 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company^ installations in the Sheikh 1 s territories'. We cannot claim that there is uniformity of practice on this point, and might therefore be prepared in the course of the negotiations not to press this point, ( c ) Royalty on natural ^as and casinghead gas oline; The Petroleum Department proposed a royalty of four annas per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas sold, and a royalty of one anna per gallon in respect of casinghead gasoline. The Company include casinghead gasoline with crude oil and propose a royalty equal to one-sixth of the field price received from the sale of any natural gas recovered by the Company, What the Petroleum Department had in mind, in English currency, was 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas and -J-d, a gallon for casinghead gasoline, but an error ?7as made in converting these amounts into annas and the rates proposed to the Company were therefore higher than was intended. In the Iraq Petroleum Company's Agreement a royalty of 2d. per 1,000 cubic feet has to be paid on natural gas and this is the rate levied in Trinidad. There are some advantages in having a definite rate of royalty but the Petroleum Department does not- suggest that, in a place like Bahrein, this is likely to be a very important matter, and here again we might be prepared to give way during the negotiations, Casinghead gasoline is a more valuable produce than crude oil/~ 5 - oil, and if it is included with crude oil, the royalty would be a good deal less than -g-d. per gallon. This is a point which might be further discussed with the Company. In the United States the practice, in the case of casinghead gasoline produced in California, is to charge a royalty of one-sixth to one-eighth of the value of the stabilised natural gasoline, less cost of stabilisation. The Petroleum Department has no definite informatic: as to what this would represent in English currency, but it would probably be in the neighbourhood of ^d. a gallon. At this rate the royalty on a ton of casinghead gasoline would be about 12/6d. against the rate of 5/3d. on crude oil. The Company may argue that they will only be able to dispose of this gasoline, which is a highly volatile product, by mixing it with the crude oil. If they do, it is suggested that we need not press the point unduly. One other relatively unimportant point on Article VII, may be mentioned. The original agreement provided for the possibility of revising the rate of royalty after ten years during which royalties had been paid. The Company have now substituted fifteen years. They may claim some virtue for this, but, inasmuch as under the original agreement no tonnage royalty might have been due for payment during the first five years (i.e. until the Company had declared that oil had been discovered in 'commercially exploitable quantities'), there would be no substance in their claim. Having disposed of the more detailed points it is now possible to examine the two revised Articles from the broader point of vierw of determining whether they represent a fair basis as between the Sheikh and the Company. Under the original agreement, the Sheikh was to receive Rs.lO^OOO on the signing of the lease and Rs.10^000 per annum thereafter/'thereafter until the Company should declare that oil has 'been discovered in 'cornmercially exploitable quantities' when a tonnage royalty was to be paid on all oil produced, with a minimuEi payment of Rs. 30,000 per annum. The declaration as to commercial production had to be made within five years or the Sheikh could require the Company to surrender the lease. In the revised draft lease the Company has deleted all reference to a declaration of commercial production and provide forthwith to do what under the original agreement they might not have been required to do for five years after the granting of a mining leaser That the Company will presumably argue is as far as -hey ought to be expected to go. As they are now making arrangements to ship substantial quantities of oil, they may admit that they would find it difficult to say that they had not discovered oil in commercial quantities, and if oil is going to be produced in quantity why should the Sheikh bother because he will get his royalties? But in fact the Company has virtually given away the minimum of Rs.30,000 in the Agreement of the 21st November,1933, relating to the prospecting licence, and we might therefore claim on behalf of the Sheikh that under the Mining Lease he could, on the basis of the original arrangement, reasonably expect to receive a higher minimum than the revised prospecting licence provides for. This question is discussed in the letter from the Petroleum Department of the 15th February, 1934, to Mr, Laithwaite, and in the note of the discussion which Mr, Laithwaite had with Mr. Ballantyne on the 16th May, 1934. These two documents can form the basis of the further discussion with the Company, when it is suggested an effort should be made to secure a larger minimum royalty than Rs,30,000 (about £2,250). There also seems no reason why the Sheikh should/siiould not receive the lump sum payment on signing the lease which the original agreement provides for. One other point remains on these two Articles which has a definite bearing on the question of minimum royalty. In Article VIII. the minimum of Rs.30^000 is payable in respect of any complete calendar year in which the Company continues work. In the former Article X. the Company was required to do a certain amount of work continuously, and therefore, except when the Company did not work for causes 'beyond their control, they had to pay the Rs. 30,000, Kow the Company propose to replace the old Article X. by a new Article IX. in which there is a proviso which would, in certain circumstances which are not difficult of attainment, relieve the Company of the obligation of continuous working. It is suggested therefore that Article YIII. should be revised after n Rs»30,000 M to read 'in any completed calendar year in which, this lease continues in operation'. The reference to Article V, in Article VIII. should be altered to Article IV. The Company have also inserted a new Article XI. which gives them the right to terminate the lease on giving three months' notice, so that, if the increased minimum royalties which have been suggested were to prove onerous, the Company can get rid of the obligation by exercising their rights under Article XI. Article IX &gt; This Article has been revised by the Company. There is no objection to it in its new form provided the alteration to Article VIII. suggested above is agreed to by the Company, This Article has been redrafted partly to meet the point raised in our schedule of amendments (B. Article XII. ) and/and aluhourh sli^ntly diiierent in form can be regarded as meeting our point. Ai uicle It isuggested that the wtrds 'referred to in Ai tide IV 11 should be substituted for the words 'beyond their contr ol' in lines 5 and 6* and that the Y /ord 'paragraph' should be substituted for the word 'sentence' in the last line but one. Article ,1 . This, as already pointed out, is a new Clause which the Company has put in which enables them to surrender the lease on giving three months' notice. Under the present Agreement (Article YII of the main part) the Company has the right to stop work if they do not find oil in sufficient quantity. The Company evidently feel now that this does not give them sufficient protection. Subject to the Company meeting H.M.Government on the points raised on Articles VII and VIII of the new draft lease, there is no objection to accepting this. Article XII . An addition has been made to this Article to meet the last part of the proposal made in our schedule of amendments (B. Article XII) s to preventing any uncontrolled flow of oil. Article ZIII . No corment. Articles MY to ::' . 1I . These are the British control clauses lifted from the Supplementary Agreement of 12th June, 1930, with the reference to Major Holmes deleted. Articles XVIII to :XI . There are new Articles inserted by the Company which in the main meet the points raised in our schedule of amen.ments (C. 1 to 4). In C.l it was proposed that the Company should keep correct geological plans and records which should be open to inspection by the Sheikh. This the /1 &gt; - 9 - the Company have not accepted but it is an important and very widely accepted provision. It appears in the Iraq Petroleum Company B.O.D. and Persian concessions. In fact in tnose concessions the Company is required to furnish the Governments concerned with reports. The same provision is made in Trinidad. In this country there is a statutory provision, which covers all mining activities, requiring operators to furnish to the Government Geological Survey Department 8.11 geological information which the Department may require. It is suggested therefore that we should press the Company on this. If they required us to insert a provision that the geological reports should be regarded as confidential for a period, we could not resist this. Articles XXil. clio. XXIII. No comment.: coHFiaaHTiAL.

His Britaimic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein, Dear Sir: In a recent letter, Ro.PA-88 dated June 1st, I attempted to briefly describe to you the duties of the so-called flooring Master at Bahrem. A letter has just been receired froa Mr. Lcnbardi which contains a more cotaploto explamtiou of the real nature of this man 's duties. Believing It will give you and throufih yon His Excellency ShaiJfti Hanod bin Isa Al-Fhalifah a lauch clearer con ception of the position than the farmer caaaunication was able to do, I m glTing you herevfith an extract of the Information contained In Mr. Laobardl 's letter 'Perhaps the nature of the duties to be j&gt;€rfomied by thm Moorish Master (which term, we think, ehould properly be Moorint: Director) in connection with the operation of our submarine loading-line has not been made entirely clear to you. In the first place, sceie misunderstanding as to the nature of the duties may hawe arisen through the fact that Captain Nelson v as originally referred to at times as the 'Harbor Master'. FMi such a designation I can understand how the Gorsrn- BUKit could easily sain the impression that we desired Captain el son to assume some jurisdiction over the harbor Itself - which, of course, is not the Intention. ISier© is no desire for Captain Pelson's duties to con flict with any proper govermaental functions. *1 note also that there seems to be an impression that Captain Kelson will serve as a Pilot, in addition to his functions as Mooring Director. It has nerer been our plan tnat Captain Kelson should serve as a Pilot in the true sense of the word. He will. It is true - if requested - go out to raeet the tankers as they come into the terminal, and assist the captains in mooring their ships at the end of the loading line. vJereCaptain Nelson to take control of the wheel ot the ship and act a® a Pilot, this would mean the as sumption of reeponelbility for the eafe oonduet of the ship; there has never been any thought on our part that t :;c flooring Director should assume such responsibility and, consecjiAeri^lyi I think it is really a mlBnoBier for him to be elas *ified in any way as a Pilot. I hope you will be able to make it dear that, in acting as Mooring Director, Captain Nelson will be merely a prirate esaployee of Hie Bahrein Petroleum Ooaapany, and that his duties will not partake of a public nature such as would inevitably be the case were he to be a Hart) or Master or a Pilot, H As I Gee it, Captain Nelson will really be our Port Captain, looking out for our om indlTidual marine affairs. In his capacity as Mooring Director for the submarine line, it will be his duty to assist the tanker captains in making proper connections between their ships and the hose at the end of the line. Picking up the hose and makine the con nection so that damage to the line will be aToided and no oil will be spilled into the water is a Job requiring experience on the part of the man handling the operation. Also, it requires eacpert guidance in making the disconnection and placing the hose on the bottom without kinking, ready for the next pick up, after the tanker has been loaded. We hare found, through our experience in operating other submarine loading—lines on the Pacific Ooast and in .'exico, that H»ny Tanker captains coming into a submarine loading- terminal for the first time have only a hazy idea of the accomplishment of the tasks inrolred in makinc the con nections and disconnections. T t is for this reason thax we oust have a thoroughly-experienced employee to serve as Mooring Director. Lack of experience and skill in this work will almost inevitably result in damage to the line, failure to make connections with the tankers, and loss of oil. Captain l elscm was picked for thie position on aecount of his long erporience under varied conditions; and we have fall confidence in his ability to handle the work under any ciroumBtance which may arise. w It seoiae to me that the reply you have troggeeted Is entirely in order - except for your referonce to the appointment of Captain Kelson as Hot . Froia what have said above, you will under rtamf'tliat I think the reference to his capacity as Pilot should be ellminatod.' Yours vary truly FAD/J E.A.

It appears that there is no suggestion that the Mooring fester should in any way exercise an independent authority or jurisdiction which might interfere with the authority of the Bahrein Port Officer, but that he will, in fact, be in the strictest sense a servant of tne Company, employed on certain technical duties. It is perhaps, in these circumstances, unnecessary to make his appointment formally subject to the consent of the sheikh or formally to provide that he shall be under the control of/fn n - 3 - of the Port Officer, and if you agree (perhaps you would let me know hy telegram) we will inform the Company accordingly Yours sincerely,p'.z. 3 520/34. ll *)/ /=\ THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED, 19 Mo orgate, London, E.G.2 25th May, 1934, De ar Mr, Lai thv/ai t e, Moorinp; Master and Pilot . I am now directed by the CompanyX® communicate with you in reply to your letter P.Z.2704/34 of the 1st May in which you state that as regards the Mooring Master the position is that it is regarded as desirable in principle that the consent oif the Bahrain Government should be obtained to any appointment of this nature and that Mooring haster and Pilot should be, as stated in your letter ^(presumably that of the 21st April) subject to 'the authority of the Bahrain Government's Port Officer and that the Shaikh had been advised accordingly. The Company's Chief Local Representative at Bahrain lias also leceived from the lolitical Agent, Bahrain, a 1)^1% coniLiunicauion to the effect that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad desires him (the Political Agent) to point out to the Company that the Bahrain G-overnment already have a Port Officer and that his (presumably the Port Officer's) previous consent to the employment of the proposed Mooring Master and j J ilot should be asked for. It is assumed this communication results from the advice given to His .Excellency by His Majesty's Government, The Company entirely iails to understand why such advice should have been given to His Excellency the Shaikh of Bahrain seeing that the piloting of vessels to the Company's ancorage and the mooring of vessels are matters solely/- 2 - 1 I ' solelj connected with the Company's own operations of producing oil under its Concession Agreement and that this work of piloting and mooring is work undertaken by the Company's own Official. The Company cannot but feel that there is some misunderstanding of the true position in the minds of the Advisers of His Majesty's Government, particularly as the piinciple which is sought to be introduced is a new one and directly contrary to the freedom of action accorded to the Company by its Concession Agreement and essential &gt;'0 the successful carrying out of its operations at Bahrain. On the other hand, the creation of reasonable and consistent Harbour Regulations concerning the movements and care oi incoming and outgoing vessels within the Territorial v/aters of His Excellency's Government are, of course, an entirely dilferent matter and one in which the Bahrain Government could.look to the fullest and most lively co-operation of the Company. It seems to the Company that there has, perhaps, been a failure to make clear in the letters I have referred to above that it is these Regulations His Majesty's Government have .in mind and I am asked to request that the matter should be given further consideration by His Majesty's Government and that the Company should receive assurance that interference with its freedom of action in appointing its own Officials is not sought by His Majesty's Government. In conclusion, I think I should tell you that it has been found necessary wherever the Standard Oil Company of California has a submarine loading line, to keep a man on the spot who is familiar not only with tihe channel but with the technique of placing a boat properly to receive the/0 - 3 - the loading line. This is on intricate matter and requires experience and knowledge of local conditions. The line must be picked up without kinking and the boat must at all times be kept from driving over the line otherwise it gets torn away. A great deal of care must be exercised in letting go of the line and care must be taken to lay it on the bottom without kinking. It is something that can be learned only be experience and mishandling of the situation would cause serious disaster. Yours sincerely, ( SD. ) H.R.

The following table shows the marketed production of liquefied petroleum gases for the years 1928-1933, inclusive, together with the respective annual percentages of increase:— Per cent, of increase over previous year. 314.6 119.6 81.4 59.7 18.6 14.1 ANALYSIS OF DEMAND. The liquefied petroleum gases included in this survey are propane, butane, pentane, and propane-butane mix tures. The demand for butane was outstanding in 1933, increasing from 14,661,688 gallons in 1932 to 19,056,230 gallons in 1933. Butane for domestic use increased from 81,981 gallons in 1932 to 705,894 gallons in 1933, while indus trial and miscellaneous requirements were 12,179,766 gal lons in 1933, compared with 7,353,856 gallons in 1932. The gas manufacturing industry used less butane in 1933, the total being 6,170,570 gallons, compared with 7,225,851 gal lons the previous year. Slightly smaller quantities of pro pane went into domestic consumption and gas manufac ture in 1933 compared with 1932, while industrial and mis cellaneous uses showed an increase. Although the demand for pentane and propane-butane mixtures showed a small net loss for 1933, compared with 1932, the quantity required for industrial and miscellaneous purposes was greater in 1933 than in the previous year. The pentane deliveries declined from 854,126 gallons in 1932 to 813,725 gallons in 1933. USE OF PROPANE. Propane is used mostly for supplying gas to those con sumers which are beyond the mains of natural or manu factured gas companies. This gas under pressure and in a liquid state is distributed to consumers in metal cylinders or drums. The liquid, being released into the household system at atmospheric pressure, gasifies and is used in the same manner as ordinary gas supplied from regular gas company mains. BUTANE. Butane, although used to a limited extent for domes tic consumption, is in greatest demand for industrial and gas manufacturing purposes. Various industries require it as a fuel in certain manufacturing processes, while gas companies use it to enrich their manufactured gas or keep it on hand as a reserve at peak load times or in case of failure of their regular supply. Gas companies, in neigh bourhoods where natural or manufactured gas is not available, sometimes distribute butane to consumers, either mixed with air or undiluted. THROUGH MAINS. The American Gas Association has furnished the Bureau with the following information regarding the dis tribution of liquefied petroleum gases:— ' At the end of 1933, liquefied petroleum gas was being delivered through mains to consumers in 137 communities in 28 States by 56 companies. Butane- air gas with heating value ranging from 520 to 600 b.t.u. per cu. ft. was supplied to 91 communities in 26 States by 48 companies. A mixture of undiluted butane and propane gas with a heating value of 2,800 to 3,000 b.t.u. per cu. ft. was supplied to 12 communities in California and Nevada by 5 companies. Undiluted propane gas, with a heating value of 2,550 b.t.u. per cu. ft., was supplied to 34 communities in Minnesota, North Dakota and Wis consin by 3 companies. These latter three com panies distribute gas in some communities through mains from a central plant and in others use an ^ ' alley tank' system, delivering to a number of con sumers on the same block from a central reservoir. ' At the end of 1933 three communities in Canada were also supplied with butane-air gas. One community, Three Rivers, Quebec, was supplied from a plant in that city, while Milltown and St. Stephen, New Brunswick, were being supplied by the Citizens Gas Company from its plant at Calais, Maine.' TANK VEHICLES AND PIPE LINES. Liquefied petroleum gases delivered in tank cars, tank wagons or pipe lines, increased from 19,717,798 gallons in 1932 to 24,515,445 gallons in 1933, while the total shipped in cylinders or drums was practically the same as in 1932. This increase in tank car and tank wagon deliveries was to be expected, as the increase in demand for these gases in 1933 was nearly all limited to the industrial field, where bulk shipments are predominant. The survey covers reports submitted by 21 companies. 5 of which operate in the Pacific Coast area. Deliveries of the Pacific Coast companies totalled 6,714,922 gallons in 1933, compared with 6,173.456 gallons in 1932, while the quantity marketed east of California was 32,216,086 gal lons in 1933 and 27,941,311 gallons in 1932.

The ships engaged in this prosaic, port-to-port work have little concern with the glamour and romance which often attaches to tramp freighters and passenger vessels that drop anchor in far, exotic harbours. But now and then romance comes aboard an oil-tanker to interrupt the even tenor of its ways. For an interesting example of such deviation from a prescribed course, consider this com pany's tanker ' El Segundo,' at present engaged in as romantic a bit of voyaging as ever comes the way of a merchant ship. This sturdy steam-tankship, long familiar on the Pacific Coast, has become an expeditionary vessel to the far Per sian Gulf, almost 180 degrees of longitude, or half-way round the earth, from San Francisco. She sailed from San Pedro on December 30, 1933. The expedition is for the purpose of constructing a marine loading-terminal to make available for marketing the newly discovered oil on Bah rein Island, the largest of a group of islands which forms DESCRIPTION OF MAP OPPOSITE. Here is an accurate relief map of Bahrein and the smaller islands of the Bahrein group, prepared by Standard Oil Company of Cali fornia engineers. Shown in white are the gathering lines, the draw bridge, the three tanks, the submarine pipe line—all under construction now. Shown also are the producing wells (solid white), and the drilling wells (circles). Near the hill called Jebel Duhkan, 450 feet above sea level and the highest elevation on Bahrein Island, the drillers first found oil. Here is the camp of the field workers. At the end of the three-mile submarine line is indicated the mooring arrangement for tankers, in 50 feet of water. The tiny mounds scattered over the island are tombs, some 10,000 in number and said to be of Phoenician origin. the independent State of Bahrein, governed by Sheikh Hamad. In April, 1930, a party of geologists from the home office landed on the island to survey the lands covered by the concession granted by the Sheikh. Follow ing careful surveys, a favourable report was made, and drilling was started in 1931. About a year later the first well ' came in,' and since that time production has been brought to the commercial stage by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California. MARINE LOADING TERMINAL. The construction work of the marine loading-terminal includes laying over three miles of 12-inch submarine pipe line from the small island of Sitrah out into the harbour, terminating in 50 ft. of water; erecting three crude-oil working tanks with floating roofs on Sitrah Island, with a capacity of 250,000 barrels, and a 7,500-barrel tank for ship's ballast water; laying more than ten miles of gather ing-lines from the producing area to the terminal; pro viding a pumping plant with a capacity of 5,700 barrels of oil an hour, housed in a dust-proof building—for ' shamals,' the local sand-storms, sometimes make life in Bahrein somewhat of a burden; installing four sets of radio telephones for communication between ship and shore, and a telephone line connecting with the present line on Bahrein Island; and building a road to the terminal, in cluding a fill or a trestle 1,200 ft. long and a draw-bridge across the channel between the two islands. The relief map indicates the location of the producing area and the pipe line that will transport the crude oil to deep water. These loading facilities will be able to handle 10,000 barrels of oil a day, with provision for adding booster pumps to double that daily capacity if greater production is desired. This work will require several months to complete. When the tanker then leaves her anchorage she will be laden with Bahrein crude, taken aboard by means of these new loading facilities, the materials for which she carried across the Pacific. She has a cargo capacity of 39,736 barrels. Where she will deliver the first oil cargo to be taken from this producing field is yet to be determined; She is expected to arrive in San Francisco about Septem ber 1. EXPEDITIONARY OUTFIT. Few merchant ships have ever outfitted as the ' El Segundo ' did; her case more nearly parallels that of a ship equipped for an Arctic expedition, for she is far from sources of supplies. Fuel for the round trip and every thing necessary for the subsistence of the 45 men aboard for a period of nine months, were taken at San Francisco, San Pedro, and Bombay. In addition, the craft was loaded with miles of pipe, sheet-steel for tank construction, five 8-ton anchors, six marking buoys, three trucks, a trailer, two tractors, numerous air-compressors, electric-welding generators for the work of welding pipe lines and the bot toms of tanks, a derrick and an unloading platform for landing freight from lighters that operate between ship and shore, and innumerable other items of equipment, tools and materials, the list of which reads like an inven tory of a combination machine-shop and boiler factory. Since tankers have no general cargo holds, openings were cut through the steel deck so that heavy equipment and supplies could be stored in the cargo-tanks. In con nection with handling this material, particularly in Bah rein waters, cargo-booms were added to the ship's masts —incongruous enough aboard a tanker, whose normal cargo is taken on and discharged through hoses. The vessel arrived at Bahrein on February 22, and is now anchored in deep water 16,000 ft. offshore. Here, more than three miles out, the shallow water ends, and it is across this reach of shallow bottom that the loading pipe line will go, its hose-fitted discharging-end marked by a buoy. Radiating from this point the five huge anchors will be placed, their heavy chains attached to marking- buoys. When a tanker arrives for loading she will make fast to these anchors and be securely held in position. Here the ' El Segundo' lies under the torrid sun, the floating home of the engineers, structural workers, divers and others of the personnel during the construction period. A channel 30 miles long is also to be charted and marked for the safe entry of tankers to the harbour. oiviTFHR nn IMnsoi i R oumain parait lt 1 et 15 de chaque mois. rtoige en r0umain et franqais fond£ en iooo KWlCTIO 1 ' t' tOnisWAiKyi Conduit par Kllnall B II 1 \ K K S T.

The general meeting of the above association, which was formed early last year under Government auspices, took place in Berlin on April 26 Professor Ubbelohde, the president of the association, presided over a gather ing of more than 1,000 persons, although comparatively few of those were actively engaged, directly or indirectly, in the operations of the association. Government circles took an important part in the proceedings. Two German Ministers, Herr Seldte, Minister of Labour, and Herr von Elz-Riibenach, Minister of Transport, were present, as well as representatives of the German Navy and Army, and Dipl.-Ing. Gottfried Feder, State Secretary of a third Ministry. Professor Ubbelohde, in his opening address, men tioned the death during the year of the late Alfred Wirth, and all the assembly rose to their feet as a tribute to the deceased, to whom, more than to any other man, the formation of the association was due. Herr Seldte made an appeal to those present to en courage as far as possible the employment of German workers. He also pleaded for the use of the German soil to the utmost possible degree and for the most economic employment of minerals and mineral products. RAW MATERIALS AND THEIR TREATMENT. State Secretary Dipl.-Ing. Gottfried Feder remarked that the starting point for broadening the basis of the raw minerals of fuel must be a systematic investigation of German raw materials and a systematic application of methods of treatment. With regard to motor fuels there must be a planned increase in the storage capacity of raw materials from abroad. Further alternative sources of fuels must be exploited, such as distillation tar, generator gas, hydrogen, the wood gas generator, coal slack, etc. In this direction he pointed with satisfaction to the large extension by Privy Councillor Bosch of the plant at Leuna, and said that many such plants in other places were required. A determined effort must be made to reduce costs, while the Government, for its part, would do its best to reduce taxation of the industry in so far as such taxation was not for protection purposes. MOTOR-CAR FIGURES. Dr. Todt, the Inspector-General of Road Construction in Germany, dealt with the connection between the oil industry and road construction, and stated that in the previous month the construction of motor roads had em ployed about 10,000 men, requirements in the coming months being from 10,000 to 15,(00 men. Dr. Ing, e. h. Brandenburg', Ministerial Director, Ministry of Transport, dealt with fuels and the use of the motor-car and pointed out that the fuel question was a vital one in German transport policy. The fuel require ments for power vehicles in Germany were now 1,400,000 tons per annum, of which one-third was produced in Ger many; and the important question now arose how quickly the German proportion could be increased. In 1933 con sumption was not larger than in the preceding year, although there were 150,000 new registrations against 95,000 in 1932. It followed that the greater part of the new vehicles involved no new demands, but that they were being substituted for old and worn -out vehicles. It was also true that motor vehicles were not being used to caoacity so long as the fuel was too dear. Director Brandenburg mentioned, with reference to the passenger car, that it need not cost more than 1,000 marks, and that an annual mileage of 10,000 kilometres could be run f or 6 pfennige per kilometre. The average load for such a car would be from three to four persons and a speed of 80 kilometres per hour could be reached. ALCOHOL FUEL. As regards alcohol fuel, he stated that in the operat ing year 1932-1933 no less than 53 per cent, of the total sales of the Spirit Monopoly was for motor-spirit pur poses. In the current year this percentage had already increased. As it became possible to reduce the cost of the spirit, the alcohol mixture would more and more take the place of petrol. OIL FROM COAL. Professor Ubbelohde spoke on the subject of obtain ing mineral oil from the distillation of hard and soft coal. He pointed out that Germany is not in a position to cover its requirements of motor fuel, lubricating oils and high way construction materials from domestic sources. These sources consisted of German petroleum, oil produced from hard and soft coal, and alcohol produced by agriculture. In order to increase the supply, it was not possible to increase the capacity of plants now operating so long as certain products of those plants were without a market. For example, too much asphalt and tar was produced relatively to coke residue, which was almost unmarket able. Therefore, instead of burning raw coal in the household, and thus wasting liquid products, distillation coke should be burned in future. The same applied to locomotives and generating stations. There should not be any difficulty in marketing such coke, as for briquet- ting purposes it would serve very well. If the soft coal distilleries now idle were to resume work, the output of mineral oil products would be increased by 200,000 tons per annum. The heavy oils and the pitch could be con verted into lighter oil products almost without residue. Among other speakers may be mentioned Dr. A. Graf, who dealt with the latest development of geophysical apparatus. He drew particular attention to the toi sion balance of short-period oscillation known as the S20 of the Askania works. GERMANY: FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL. The Department of Overseas Trade notifies us as follows: It is reported from Berlin that a decree amend ing the Foreign Exchange regulations has been published in the ' Deutscher Reichsanzeiger,' No. 90 of April 18, 1934 - The most important alteration is that the free limit up to which foreign currency may be taken or sent out of Germany without a permit has been reduced from Rm.200 per calendar month to Rm.50. This free limit only applies to foreign currency or German coins other than gold coins. It is forbidden to take or send Reichs- mark notes (Reichsbank notes, Rentenbank notes or private German bank notes) or German gold coins abroad. A resident in Germany who has been refused foreign exchange for a particular transaction, or who has been informed that his general foreign exchange permit is not valid for certain business, may not enter into any obliga tions in respect of such transaction or business the fulfil ment of which would necessitate the permission of the foreign exchange control authorities.
