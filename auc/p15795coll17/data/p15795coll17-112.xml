One of the few Americans on faculty during his initial term at AUC, he describes of the university including the faculty in the Department of Economics and Political Science and the challenges of doing data-oriented research in Egypt. O’Connor offers a portrait of life in the late 1960s/early 1970s as a member of Cairo’s small American community, describing Maadi where he resided, expatriate social life, and economic conditions and the climate of political repression and surveillance in the aftermath of the 6-Day War. He offers a comparison with life for a relocated foreigner in the 2000s. From the vantage point of the end of his Deanship, O’Connor provides a view of the School of Business, Economics, and Communication (BEC), laying out developments in units like the Department of Mass Communication, the Management Center, and Economics and Management Departments. O’Connor addresses faculty issues at AUC like recruiting and hiring challenges, discrepancies in foreign and local hire compensation and competing research and service expectations, and in particular issues connected to the culture of BEC like the school’s faculty evaluation and tenure processes and outside consulting by professors (with comparisons with the schools of Humanities and Social Sciences and Sciences and Engineering). He explains what forestalled the creation of the Graduate School of Business sought by President David Arnold, and critiques the planned School of Public Affairs to be established in Fall 2009 and what he considered the provost’s lesser interest in business programs. He anticipates the impact on a newly-configured School of Business of anticipated shifts in resources and the transfer of departments like Mass Communications.  O’Connor also assesses upper university administration, AUC’s financial situation as affected by expansion of programs, units, and administrative positions, and the impact of the move to the new campus.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
