The first section (folios 3-9) is an alphabetical list of minor tribes/tribal sections/tribal sub-sections; each entry notes a corresponding main tribe or confederation to which it is understood they belong. The second section (folios 10-55) is arranged loosely alphabetically into entries for these main tribal groupings. Each entry includes a brief background description, along with a table providing the following information: chief(s), number of families/tents/houses, number of armed men (horse and foot), number of rifles, and a section for further notes. The information these tables provide is often broken down by tribal sub-sections.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Arabistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001b9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
