I have the honour to inform you that m August 1926 my husband, Hiaz Ali Khan while serving in Bahrain State and at the time of Parade he was shot in the office when he tried to save one British Officer. The death of my husband was quite due to his military duties and 1 his widow am entitled for some grant of pension. I received a prize of Es 1000/- on his death but the money was spent by me on the way from Bahrain to my village. 1 had to spend Es 2000/- more to fulfil the old customs of my family on one’s death. Por the present 1 am in a very poor condition as Subadar Hiaz Ali had no landed property. V/ e all sckkk depended on his service which we now loose. We are three poor fellows; one his aged mother and one his little doughter of 2 years and one 1 his wid/ow. We have received a Banad for a grant of one and a half square of land but we have not received the enter ing order to Occupy certain land. At the end I would again most humbly and res- pectfyly beg you to consider my condition and arrange for our livelihood. That is kindl^rant me some pension.

M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, With referenoe to your No. 849/27 dated 12th October 1927, I have the honour to inform you of the following facts in the case of the late Suhedar Niaz Ali. I understand that the deceased was a Jemadar at the time of his death. One of the Havildars in service at present is a relation of deceased and he knows nothing of any promotion. I myself was not aware of any recommendation. After the death of Niaz Ali his brother came from India and escorted the widow and also the widow of the Havildar who was killed at the same time^baok to India. A sum of Rs. 720/11/-, was paid to the brother of deceased for the expenses of the widows. Another Rs. 200/-, was subscribed by Mr. Ghaus and paid to At a later date H.E.Shaikh Hamad sanctioned the payment of Rs. 1000/-, to the widow as a form of^ compensation, there being no pension scheme in the Bahrain Levy lores. The total amount received by the applicant was Rs- 1720/11/-. When the Hon'ble the Political Resident was here shortly after the death of Niaz Ali I spoke to him on the subject asking for advice as to what was a suitable sum but he did not suggest any definite amount. If it is considered that the payment is inadequate I feel sure that H. E. Shaikh Hamad would mo 4*+-v TVipi ano-cp. st: i'vn tF Ur. 1000/ — consider the matter.
