Mr.Kendel, on being asked wiiat was the source of his information, replied that it was unofficial, meanwhile, the only result of the Sheikh*s present attitude was likely to be that the Iraqis would impose a rigid blockade which would cut off all trade of any kind. would surely be wiser for the Sheikh to reach an agreement with Iraq, which would allow for the continuance of legitimate trade - of which a good deal would still be carried on with Southern Iraq - if only for the sake of avoiding Basra port dues etc., and which would also lend to a settlement of his outstanding difficulties with Iraq, such as the question of his date gardens, than to drive the Iraqis into imposing a rigid blockade, which would ruin the prosperity of his State.^ 7. Sir T.Fowle took the line that, even if this happened, the Sheikh would have no one but himself to blame, and that any odium which might arise from the action would fall on Iraq, not on is liajesty , s Government. Mr.kendel replied that, however this might be, His —ajesty*s Government would be unable to escape all responsibility, Koweit was of political and strategical importance to them, and if it fell into ruin they would, in the end, suffer as much as anyone. moreover, His Majesty's Government could easily be represented by ill-intentioned people, both in the Arab countries and in Europe, as having failed to avert a situation where one of their special proteges was ruined by a powerful neighbour. There was every reason therefore why His Majesty’s Government should seek to prevei t such a situation from developing. 8. Sir A.Clark Kerr confirmed that the Iraqis were becoming so tired of the situation that they were seriously contemplating the immediate imposition of a rigid blockade. Sir John Ward had already worked out detailed plans for such a blockade, w/hichwould probably include air patrols, searchlights at short intervals on the frontier etc. It was probable that the moment the Iraqis finally realised that the Sheikh was determined to do nothing to meet them, these plans would be put into effect. Mr.Kendel drew attention to the fact that it would be extremely difficult for us to secure the lifting of such a blockade once it had been imposed, and expense had been incurred in putting it into effect. 9. Sir T.Fowle said that he thought the situation might be eased if the Iraqis would at least agree to the demarcation of the frontier between Koweit and Iraq. Sir A.Clark Kerr and Mr.Rendel pointed out in reply that there was no reason why the Iraqis, from their point of view, should agree to anything at all in regard to Koweit. Their answer to any such proposals would be 'What are we going to get out of this?'. The Iraqis were at present so annoyed with the Sheikh of Koweit that they would certainly do nothing to meet his wishes without a very substantial quid oro quo . This the Sheikh of Koweit had steadily refused to offer them. 10. Sir T.Fowle urged that it was in accordance with international custom that a frontier commission should be appointed would not this furnish a good reason for pressing the Iraqis to agree to it? Mr.Rendel pointed out that this argument only applied when nations were friendly. Frontier commissions had only been established with Iraq ! s other neighbours after general settlement had been reached with each. This was so in the case of Turkey, Syria and Persia, where it had been impossible to dojanything about frontier commissions until general relations had been established on a satisfactory basis. 11. Sir A.Clark Kerr pointed out that, in the case of Koweit, the Iraqis regarded the Sheikh as a thoroughly unsatisfactory and unfriendly neighbour who was nothing but a nuisance and for whom they • m •they were not prepared to do anything at all. The Sheikh was no doubt within his legal rights in refusing to co-operate over the suppression of smuggling, but he might have to pay heavily for insisting on those rights. 12. Sir !.1'ovvle emphasised the importance of not exercising any pressure on the Sheikh. The position of His Majesty^ Government would become impossible if they tried to oblige him to follow some course of action, and he were to refuse to do so. It was not their policy to put pressure of this kind on the Persian Gulf lulers under their protection. Mr.Kendel reminded the meeting that His Majesty’s Government had not so long ago deposed the reigning Sheikh of Bahrein; but Sir T. Powle regarded this case as not constituting a valid parallel. He entirely agreed however that it would be reasonable to put clearly before the Sheikh the choice of evils with which he was faced, provided he was allowed to choose freely between them. IS. After considerable further discussion, it was eventually agreed (a) that there would be no advantage to be gained ih asking the Iraqi Government to agree either to the demarcation of the Iraqi-, oweit frontier or to the establishment of a standing frontier commission at this stage, since they would inevitably refuse both suggestions; (b) that Hie Majesty’s Ambassador should, however, on his return to Bagdad ascertain the precise intentions of the Iraqi Government in regard to the proposed blockade, and inform His Majesty’s Government and the Political Resident in detail of the particular form that that blockade was likely to take; (c) that the Sheikh of Koweit should then be warned in the clearest terms of the measures the Iraqi Government contemplated taking in order to put an end to the smuggling by instituting a blockade, and that every effort should be made to impress upon him the extremely inconvenient/tmmmm j^r inconvenient consequences to which he would be exposed if he incii j, iooj.nocL his present attitude} (d) that it should be suggested to the Sheikh that it would be in his own interests to choose the lesser of two evils, and to agree to meeting the Iraqis' wishes over the suppression of smuggling, in order that, if possible, some comprehensive settlement might be arrived at between him and Iraq, which would at least provide for the continuance of legitimate trade and make it easier for His Majesty's Government to bring about an earlier settlement on the date gardens question; (e) finally, that, on the receipt of further information as to the precise measures which the Iraqi Government proposed to take with a view to instituting a blockade, the necessary instructions to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to give effect to conclusions (c) and (d) alove should be drafted by the India Office and Foreign 1 Office in consultation.

We have now received a copy of Baghdad Embassy’s letter No,113 dated the 28th March 1938 to the Foreign Of f ice, enclos ing the Iraqi version of this affair. No doubt a copy of this will have reached the India Office by now and you may like to look at it. 3. Briefly the Iraqi story is that the fight took place at Al Batin in their own territory, and they claim that de Canny* s discovery of blood, cartridges etc. at Idairat al f Eullah merely indicates that the smugglers had halted there during their flight*. Peterson suggests that the matter should not be pressed, particularly since it might have an unfortunate influence on the conversations in progress con cerning the Shaikh of Kuwait’s properties in Basrah. He seems also to be impressed by the Iraqi version of the affair. 4. Of course we cannot possibly agree that de Gaury is in capable of reading correctly the signs that he saw, and we can scarcely be impressed by an Iraqi version of the affair which reaches us five months later. It the same time the Iraq Government have committed themselves to the definite statement that the affair took place in their territory and I do not see that ve shall achieve any useful result by arguing the point; and indeed I think we should only be risk ing the exacerbation of anti-Kuwait feeling by so doing, admit it is not going to be easy to explain this business a %y/ I••• -«% r ■**+**. away to the Shaikh, cut 1 suggest that he must be told that in the present delicate state of negotiations about his gardens we are not prepared to take chances by pressing this case.

I said that I could not answer him off hand, but having looked things u. 1 told him, when I happened to see him this morning, that I found that there were about 20,000 Iranians in Xoweit and that it was true that a certain amount of absolutely insincere agitation against the Council hod been got up among some of them by a certain disgruntled official* and view with the utmost concern any signs of Iranian penetration on the Arabian side of the Gulf. As he had brought up Xoweit, I told him that on my return from seeing hi® last week, I bad had a good look at the map and had made a few informal inquiries on my own about smuggling* It seemed to me, from study of the map and from talking to people who had been down there, that the prevention, of smuggling through Al Batin, where whole armies could hide, was an almost superhuman task* He had suggested that the Shaikh himself might be implicated* My very superficial rt.s you well know, these people are terrified of Iran '* baqgallay, xsq. enquiriess enquiries had led me to wonaer whether the l P aqi authorities in the southern towns could he entirely above suspicion either, How else could the smugglers, who appeared to move about in very large convoys, dispose or their contraband with impunity and to such an extent ?

Facts of raid appear to be well established and incident can scarcely be allowed to pass without formal protest, but would enquiries of a joint commission help us towards our real objective ? So long as Shaikh of Koweit allows smuggling • which past correspondence (notably letter of 22nd February from &amp;r. ^endel at Koweit to His Majesty’s Ambassador) shows that he is quite able to stop • incidents will continue and our protests here will avail little. Shaikh has virtually admitted that until his trade with Saudi Arabia is restored he will take no step to stop smuggling to Iraq. How then can we expect Iraqi authorities to pay serious heed to our protests at their 'breaking the rules' in their efforts to restrict a malpractice in which, in their view, the Shaikh manifestly, and His Majesty’s Government apparently, connives ? Cannot a fresh attempt be made to break the ring by inducing Saudi Arabia to call off her blockade ? As the Iraqi Government seem disposed to consider the question of the Shaikh’s date gardens it would be particularly fortunate if this could be done now. COPY OF TELEGRAM From H.M. Ambassador, To..

He would employ- three revenue cutters twelve or more armed cars and two aeroplanes The aeroplanes would patrol whole frontier at dawn every cay and any smugglers movement across frontier would be reported by short wave wireless to car/s (distributed at suitable bases) which would then round up people observed by aircraft, further | patrolling would also be cnrried out by cars and the cutters would patrol coast. Men and material required for scheme are all available and cost of operations would not be great. May I beg Sheikh of xioweit may be approached at early dateConfidential. Political Agency, Koweit. i all you please refer to Bagdad telegram No.140 about Sir John Vard’s scheme for operations on the frontier. I confess that I do not understand the telegram fully. One asks oneself — is it based on something the Iraq Government have said or written, or one about to write or say?. Does it refer to a complete two way Blockade, - or merely increased control on the Frontier ?. 2. I Know the Sheikh’s attitude. He will say that it is a matter for the Iraq Governraent; it is nothing to do with him. He has warned all Koweitis not to smuggle, and smuggling is now much reduced and entirely confined to Iraqis. Me understand that in any case there are already twelve cars and three cutters on the frontier, one would think quite enough for the short frontier if efficiently handled, so it would only be an increase of two aeroplanes. The Sheikh will say that he has always advocated that the control should be maae effective. 3. If it is a two-way complete Blockade Iraq will lose a certain amount of trade - not much, as owing to the heavy tax in Iraq it is seldom that iloweit buys anything from Iraq. Koweit will merely order a few more goods from Bahrein and India. 4. In that case the onry question remaining is vater. Vhen it comes to the point I doubt if Iraq will care to cut it off The Hon’ble Lt-Colonel Sir Trencharc Fowle, K.C.I.H., C.B.K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.MX ( cut it off. fetter - at least to genuine Arabs - is not a thing one cuts off from fellow Arabs - if one does one is liable to be notoriously ii/iraortalizeci, like Saad and Shimr, and it is contrary to the precepts of the Koran. However the Iraqis may now be sufficiently nationalized to be able to overlook this. 5 # The Sheikh, I have seen to it, is alive to the danger. Cement tanks are being made by the richer merchants at a great rate to hold this winter’s rain. The existing wells are sufficient for the poorer classes and the Bedouins, and they are being improved. The water boats from Iraq, from seven a day in January now average only two a nay. Europeans- there is a total of 2b in „„oweit territory using Basra water, - will be most harmed by the cutting of water and they can, case of real need, I vail see to It, obtain water from the B.l.Steamers, until some other arrangement , can be made. But on this subject of water X will address you se .rately and later. 6&lt; x n any case smuggling is much reduced now, and this belated suggestion of 'operations' on the frontier appears to indicate that there are political, rather than purely economic and administrative, motives at work. Venous recent Arabic newspaper articles, all hostile to British control over the Persian Gulf, and several with the refrain of 'increased smuggling” from rowelt, seem to substantiate such a suspicion.

A meeting was held at the Foreign Office on Monday, 1st November, to discuss this question, when the following were present; Koweit, and particularly in regard to the question of smuggling, advantage of the presence in this country of Sir A.Clark Kerr and Sir T.iowle to have an informal interdepartmental discussion to see whether anything could be done to improve matters. There were two questions for discussion, an .immediate one regarding a recent incident of a fairly serious character when Iraqi police had penetrated a long way into Koweiti territory, and a general one, i.e. the whole situation between Koweit and Iraq and the Political esidm.t^ telegram No.994 of 18th October and Bagdad telegram Mo.238 of 20th October - the text of which was read out to the meeting - that Iraqi police had penetrated some 30 miles inside the Koweiti frontier. It was generally agreed that this case was so well established and so serious that a protest would certainly have to be made to the Iraqi Government Mr.G.w.hendel, in the Chair Sir A.Clark Kerr, His majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ibr.J*P.Gibson ) ) India Office. Mr. a. ■ .B.Symon) Mr.Baggallay ) ) Foreign office Mr.T.V.Brenan ) 2. Mr*Rendel said that the situation between Iraq and had become so difficult that it seemed desirable to take V J policy which ought now td be followed 3. As regards the first, it w?e clear from the Actingabout it, ^ir T^iovi/l© and the India Office representatives were anxious that the Iraqis should be pressed to agree to an enquiry with which the Political Agent, Koweit, would be associated, in the hop that this might assist in establishing the principle of a joint enquiry into Iraq-Koweit frontier I incidents and prepare the way for the appointment of a joint frontier commission which would be in a position to enquire into frontier incidents as soon as they had been reported. Sir A.Clar„ Kerr and the Foreign Office representatives, however, felt that it would be useless to do more than to make a formal protest, as there would be no hope, in existing conditions, of obtaining any satisfaction from the Iraqis, It ?»as agreed that telegraphic instructions should be sent to Mr,Scott to make a strong protest about this case as soon as possible. 4. Turning to the general question of smuggling, Mr.lendel drew attention to the extremely unsatisfactory character of the present situation. The Sheikh of Koweit took the line that he was under no obligation to take any steps to stop smuggling. This I was perfectly correct, and the Sheikh was entirely within his legal rights in allowing the smuggling to go on. But as a result of this the Iraqis were becoming increasingly ill-disposed towards him, and it was becoming inpossible for His Majesty's Government to obtain from the Iraqis the settlement of any outstanding questions in which the Sheikh of Koweit was involved. The most important of these was the question of the Sheikh's date gardens in Iraq. We were unfortunately on weak ground in pressing the Iraqis to settle this question, where we had entered into a perpetual commitment which we had failed to get the Iraqis formally and specifically to take over in 19^4, though it was more or less covered by a general provision ...provision of our treaty. The Sheikh’s attitude on the smuggling question had very greatly increased our difficulties. 5. Sir A.Clark Kerr strongly confirmed this statement. He explained that, if the Sheikh had shown the slightest willingness to meet the Iraqis over the question of smuggling a year ago, it would have been easy for hir to secure a satisfactory settlement of uhe date gardens question. Hikmat Suleiman, the , then Prime Minister, had been perfectly ready to conclude a comprehensive settlement with Kcweit, which would have disposed once and for axl of all these questions. The Sheikh’s insistence, however, on his legal freedom to allow smuggling to go on, and refusal to commit himself to the terms of any particular agreement with the Iraqis with a view to the suppression of smuggling, at least until the baudi blockade ol Koweit should have been lifted, had completely wrecked any hope of this comprehensive settlement, and had ^ade it much mere difficult to reach any kind of settlement of the date gardens question no?. . I having insisted that smug ling was carried on mainly by Iraqis for the benefit of people in Iraq, Mr.Lendel replied that, even if this were so, Koweit must obviously bear the main responsibility for the smuggling, since it was through K owe it that the goods were imported. Moreover, the Sheikh himself had admitted that, if smuggling were stopped before the Saudi blockade was lifted, his State would be ruined. This gave a clear indication of the extent to which his State was at resent engaged in smuggling, and the amount of profit derived therefrom. It was credibly reported that the Sheikh was at present utting aside at least ££0,000 a year. Sir T.Powle expressed some doubt that this figure was accurate, or that the Sheikh’s savings - whatever these might be - came entirely from 6.

Sir, X have th© honour to forward a letter of comp 1 aint from the Ruler about the treatment of Kuwaitis by the Iraq. Customs Police of the Boom sailing ship stationed near Umm qasr (Royal Air force Sketch map of Kuwait 1, 50,000). 2 ^ j have seen the owner of the jolly-boat mentioned in paragraph (a) of the Sheikh’s letter. His name is Muhammad bin Shahab and h© is one of those fishermen who in the season of the greatest cold abandon for a time their fisning, and collect firewood, laying in a store for the rest of the year for themselves, and selling any surplus. These people have favourite places by ancient family custom for collecting the wood. This man says he has been to Bahai th every year since he was a small boy when he used to go with his iauher and uhat .Dahaith has a lightish sandy soil so that th© bushes, which are big because so far from any settlement, can be easily torn out. He says that when he was going to 'hor Bahai th, which runs into the Khor Bubiya aoout three quarter of a mile south of the usual station of the Customs sailing boat opposite Umm qasr, 4 Customs Police descended upon him, one going to the west side of him i.e. on the mainland, and the Makhuda and three landing on the south end of the Island opposite, which the Royal Air Pore© sketch map of Kuwait, 1, 50,000 shows.3 # I have also seen one of his sailors ^Mullah “bin Yusuf of the Bin Nusf quarter of Kuwait and examined him sepBrately. His story supports that of the report and the ©vraer. He confirms that they were fired at hy the Customs taken Police and has described to me how at nisht he was/up on the deck of the Customs Boat, stripped and beaten and threatened with being thrown in the water if he would not confess that he was a smuggler. They were he says constantly being cursed and knocked about as long as they remained on the boat. They had a little food of their own to eat aid nothing was given them by the Customs Police, k letter to Subair from the Customs Police was he says taken by 'the car of al hsaimi* which seems to be a postal contract car and the reply, which apparently authorised their release, came to the land opposite the Customs boat by hand of a Bedouin. 4. I have also seen Jasim bin Muhammad of the Hilal quarter of Kuwait, owner of the Shu’i sailing boat mentioned in paragraph (c) of the Sheikh*s letter and two of his men and examined them separately. They confirm the report. Jasim says that when the black Bao launch with men in uniform came up with them they were sheltering in the north end of Ehor Tha’alib and against its western shore. (Khar Iha'aiib is the channel at the western end of Warba Island, connecting the Khor Subair and the Ehor Subiya). He was therefore south of the junction of the IChor Abdullah and the Khor Aubeir and in Kuwait waters, as was the launch. 5. Ahmad bin Muhammad Bu Msli one of the crew of the al lluwaddhaf quarter 0 f Kuwait confirms that they were sheltering in the Khor Tha'alib when about 8 p.m. the black Bao Customs Police launch came up to them, having presumably seen their light. He confirms that the Police told them they had no right in that place and if they came again they would confiscate their boat and imprison them.3 6 Hasan Mn Mannahi of the Eilal quarter of Kuwait also one of the crew, confirms the account and that they were sheltering in the Khor al Tha’alih when the 'black Customs launch from Kao came up with them at night and threatened them and warned them not to come for pram fishing in that place again and if they did they would he imprisoned. 7. The ¥Jitnesses in case (h) were not available this week being absent on a voyage. 8, X suggest that the Customs Police at Pao be warned that Khor Tha f allb and the Bay of Bahai th are in Kuwait. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant . &gt; ' r ' Captain Political Agent, Kuwait.Translation of a letter No.B/5/383 dated 7th Ternary 1937 from His Excellency the Huler of Kuwait to the I olitical igent, Kuwait• After Compliiaents, (a) I 'beg to state that on or about the 22nd Shawal last (5/1/37) a small jolly-boat with two men on born?! proceeded from Kuwait to Khor al Bahaith, north of Suhiya for the purpose of collecting firewood. On their arrival there they saw a loom anchoring opposite Umm Qasr. When they were not lar from the Boom, the Hakhu&amp;a of the Boom and four policemen disembarked in a jolly-boat. One policeman was landed ashore on the western side and the three other policemen and the akhuda proceeded in the jolly-boat towards the eastern side, -hen they (lraq.i men) came opposite them (Kuwaitis) the policeman who was on the western side fired a shot in the air towards them and shouted to them to lower their sail which was up. On lowering their sail the three policemen and the Nakhuda went to them and took them with their jolly-boat to the Boom where they were ordered to remove the sail, rudder and oars of their jolly-ooat and keep them in the Boom. Thereafter they told them that they were smugglers arid that they should inform them about their goods. They told them that they were poor people ami knew nothing about such business but they started beating the crew of tne jolly-boat a-nfl kept him naked at night. Though a strong Shamal was blowing and the weather was very cold they wanted to put him in water. The crew was crying and begging them to treat him with mercy and when he was about to get into the water that the Nakhuda of the Boom saved him. Besides this one of the policemen named Tasin beat him with a stick and slapped him in order that he may be compelled to say that tney were smugglers. When they (Iraqi policemen) ascertained that they (Kuwaitis) were poor firewood collectors they sent a report by car to Zubair and on the 4th Dhil oadah (17/1/37) when the reply was received from Zub&amp;ir the Kuwaitis were released, ihe namesnames of the policemen as given hy the Kuwaitis are as follows: - Ali Haidar, Kadhem, Yasin, Sj f az and the Nakhuda. (h) At the same time they (Iraqi Police) saw a small Bhu’i which had gone for firewood* They seized the Shu f i and detained the ere?/ with those of the jolly-boat in the Boom. They were released on receipt of orders from ilubeir with strict warnings that they should not land again ashore for collecting firewood* The crew of the jolly-boat were: Muhammad bin Abdullah Shahab (Makhu&amp;a) Abdullah bin lusuf (crew who was beaten) The crew of the 8hu # i were: Gthman bin Yusuf (Kakhu&amp;a) Ali bin Othman (crew) Abdullah bin Muhammad (crew). These people are poor and do not know anything about smuggling. (c) About 5 days ago th© motor launch of Bao saw the prawn catchers who were sheltering on the western side as a strong South wind was blowing* Since many years those who catch prawn enter Khor Subiya for the purpose of catching prawns* Nafthuda Jasim bin Muhammad told the launch people that they were prawn catchers and had taken shelter owing to the wind but the launch men told them that their limit was from Khor Warba and southwards and that they have no permission to visit that place. The launch man slapped the Makhuda of the Shu f i when he said that they had been catching place prawns at the ssme/bdase since many years. He ordered them to gc and not to return to that place as it ?/as not their country and told them that they would be imprisoned and their boat detained if they return to that place again.

My dear Colonel, I have long suspected that the Iraqis a were not genuinely anxious to bring smuggling to an end - were not averse to its continuance since it gave them a stick with which to beet Kuwait. I have refrained from saying so since it is a difficult thing to prove, but now I bring to your notice some facts which you may think relevant. 2 . men Hajl al Asil, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, was here I ventured to suggest that in addition to 'maintaining vigilance' on the frontier (his phrase) there should also be increased enquiry and Police activity in the ‘back arQas , e.g. Basra, Suq ash dheukh etc. since most of the smuggling was conducted at the order of Iraqi merchants by Iraqi tribes. nargon recently mentioned it as a fact to Hugh Montgomery that most of the smuggling was conducted from Iraq, and he told me only a few days ago that he had pointed J - •*&gt;- «M&gt; I out the need, for action on the lines mentioned above to ****** v Iraqi Police Officers but without th«^r taking any action. r Again he told me in confidence on 6th February that he had actually given the numbers of the motor cars 0* # % and the names of Iraqi drivers and persons engaged in removing goods from dumps formed in Iraqi territory by .Kipp ^ f Iraqi emugdere, to Ms Police Officers. They take no action on his information, he said, 4.

I introduced the witnesses. The Iraqi Commandant examined them. Major Sargon’s clerk and tne Agency inter preter both wrote down their evidence. I macie a brief note on each case and at the end of the investigation I read them over to Major Jargon and suggested that he should tell me if he disagreed# In the cases shown in my above mentioned letter as ^Proved 0 , my notes were to tne effect that the witnesses had been unsnaken in their evidence end tne rolice had no suggestions to offer. Major S argon agreed that all my notes were correct. He preferred not to initial them. I was, as you are aware, only associated with him in his investigation and I did not for that reason press him for a Committee Report. 2. Whatever the other results of tne meeting may be 1 think that it should nave the excellent effect of preventing or at any rate checking further incursions.

Moreover, in view' of the uncertainty which exists ae to the exact position of the frontier in the neighbourhood* of the junction of the Khor £nbslr with the Khor Abdullah and Khor rubiya, it seems doubtful whether even a joint examination of the witnesses could establish positively whether Muhammad bin The Honourable Lleuten&amp;nt-Oolonel K.

The Khor in question lies in Iraqi waters, pnd it was recently discovered that Koweiti launches and balsjas had been entering it ostensibly for the oumose of wood cutting but actually for the purpose of smugrling goods. Accordingly, in the first incident the officials engaged in the suppression of smuggling carried out their official duties in searching the two launches which they eventually released; while the occupants of enquiries failed to prove that/the launches in question were beaten and roughly handled. As regards the second incident, enquiries reveal thft no such incident has at all taken place; while the responsible officials know nothing about, and not even the name of, Hor Tha’alab, in whose waters the incident is said to have taken place. I *vail myself of this opportunity to express to Your excellency my highest consideration and esteem. Yours sincerely, {Sd.) Haji al Asll.
