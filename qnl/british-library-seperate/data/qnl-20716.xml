Kemball reports that in his meetings with the various shaikhs, the [Crimean] war with Russia and the recapture of Bandar Abbas [Bandar-e ʻAbbās] by the Imam of Muscat, were the main topics of general conversation.Other topics raised in conversation, and which Kemball relates, include: the overall observance of the maritime truce; disputes and hostilities between tribes, including blood feuds; two specific cases of ‘maritime irregularity’, or hostilities at sea, both rooted in the flight of debtors from one port to another, or in the capture of runaway slaves; and the continued importation of slaves, particularly by the subjects of the Umm al-Qaywayn and Joasmee [Āl Qāsimī] chiefs.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000049#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
