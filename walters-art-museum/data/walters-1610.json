There was a marked change between the way late 12th Dynasty and mid 19th Dynasty kings were represented. The pharaohs of the 12th Dynasty wished to present an experienced and careworn expression. This is conveyed by heavy eyelids, wrinkles, and a firm set to the mouth. The pharaohs of the 19th Dynasty, however, wanted their images to suggest youth, vigor, and confidence. To transform a Middle Kingdom royal image into a New Kingdom one, sculptors re-carved the face. The eyes, nose, and forehead of this sculpture show evidence of reworking to erase signs of age, while the corners of the mouth were deeply drilled to make the cheeks appear rounder and to bring the lips closer to the slight smile typical of 19th Dynasty royal sculpture.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1912", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/2362", "Keywords": "uraeus; king; headcloth", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1912, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "12th Dynasty, 19th Dynasty", "Reign": "Sesostris III-Amenemhat III, Ramesses II", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.19", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "555", "Images": "ARG_22.351_Fnt_BW.jpg, PS1_22.351_3QtrLft_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.351_3QtrRt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.351_Back_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.351_Fnt_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.351_LftSide_DD_T11.jpg, PS1_22.351_RtSide_DD_T11.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
