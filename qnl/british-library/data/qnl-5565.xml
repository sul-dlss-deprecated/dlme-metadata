I have the honour to be with the highest respeot, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) A.W*.

No.( b)196 (37/5 II) J -^Oth August 1934 * .V vV a Sir, ] . i .? I have the honour- to -report that on May 14th last it was announced in the local Press that the Iraq Government had granted permission for the Soviet Commercial Representative at Tehran to pay a short visit to Bagdad for the purpose of purchasing certain Iraqi products such as wool. A later report published in the Arabic Journal 'Al Ikha al Watani' on June 5th stated that a further object of the Trade Representative *3 visit to Iraq was to negotiate a treaty of commerce between Iraq and Russia to enable the latter to place her products and manufactures on the Iraqi market and to export Iraqi products to Russia in return. 2. Following on these announcements the Commercial Representative, Alexander Staupak, arrived in Basra on June 8 th 1934, and rented a house there. At the end of July he had not opened his office at Basrah but had done his best to dispose of Russian merchandise already dumped at that port- An extract from Basra Consulate Economic Report for July showing his achievements in that direction is enclosed. 3. M. Stoupak arrived at Bagdad from Basra on August 16th. In view of his supposed intention of buying Iraqi products, an extension of the period of residence in Iraq originally authorised was granted to him and the Bagdad Chamber of Commerce prepared for his guidance a list of Iraqi products with prices and details regarding exportation. When it became known a week later that M. Staupak had not been near the Chamber of Commerce and had made no overtures for the purchase of Iraqi produce, there was an outcry in the local HIS MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE. Press/2 press which accused him of having come to sell and not to buy. Moved by this agitation, the Commercial Representative called at the Bagdad Chamber of Commerce on Friday last and discussed the object of his mission, explaining that he was studying the prices of Iraqi products capable of being exported to Russia such as wool, lambskins and dates, that he was collecting and sending to Russia samples of these products, and that if he received instructions to effect purchases he would not hesitate to act upon them. 4* So far as is known, M. Staupak has not entered into any negotiations with tbe Iraq Government for a commercial agreement despite the Press suggestion that he was to come here with that object in view. If the very nebulous proposals for the export of Iraqi produce to Russia as an offset to her imports into Iraq do eventually materialize, resulting in a more or less balanced trade between the two countries, M* Staupak ? s mission may prove beneficial to Iraq; but at the present juncture it-is permissible to express extreme scepticism on this point. 5* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Gommercial Secretary at Tehran and the Acting Consul, Basra.

The Russo-Persian Import and Kxiport company 'Sharq' seems to have come to an end although the details of its demise appear to be far from possessing a clear-cut character. 2. In January a bank at Tehran wrote enquiring whether it was a true bill that the ''Representation Com erciale de I’U.S.l.R. en Terse' were in charge of the winding up of the Dharq Company. This was replied to on February 8 by a letter signed by one N.a.A nantohemco an a woman-lawyer Jacobowskaia in which it was stated that, following a decision of the share holders, the Sharq Company was being wound up by a liquidation commission, whose headquarters were at 6 , Ilynka, Moscow, and whose representative at Tehran was Anantchenko. 3. Again, on February 12, writing under the style of 'Representation Coamercxale en 'Khouzlstan' from Uohainmera (or Ahwaz), Uessrs. Pierre Kirtchin, Malishoff, and Jerusalemsky, formerly of 'Sharq”, sent their Basra bank a copy of a notice relating to the winding up of the Sharq Company in which it was stated that the shareholders had decided that the concern should be wound up as from January 1 by a liquidation commission, whose headquarters were at 6 , Ilynka, Moscow, that the commission's representative in Tehran was i.nantchenko, and that he had capacity to deal vith claims, etc., up to April 1, after which date everything should be referred to the liquidation commissionat Moscow, and requested the bank to treat all accounts and business standing in the name of the Sharq Company as being now in the name of 'Representation Commercials en Khouaistan'. ! Phe bank, which is aware of the Tehran correspondence, is naturally maintaining a very cautious attitude. 4. Soviet activities in the ior;a of movements of their agents have increased at Basra during the last few weeks as the following schedule shows, viz:- Name arrival Provenance Left. Destination.

They had, incidentally, been granted a tourist*s three months visa for Iraq; their avowed object in wishing to come to this country was for the purpose of buying Ira-, wool. Since their arrival in Baghdad, however, their whole preoccupation would appear to have been in connection with the establishment of a branch or agency as stated above. 5. It is commonly reported that I essrs. alishoff and Jerusalemsky were unable to place any goods at Basra.3. This, however, is a difficult report to control effectively, end in any case these Soviet representatives may have entered into forward arrangements, though this is not likely. Kirtchin opened a store on Phbruary 9 in / shar opposite the premises of the Eastern Bank and has placed a local jew in charge of it on a monthly salary of two hundred rupees. It is hoped in a later memorandum to furnish details regarding goods which may come to be shown in it. 6 . A considerable amount of V .r. 1 ,R. cotton goods was pushed up to Basra from ^ohnmraera during the first days of January which has not been noticed before. This, in three consignments, amounted to 2,537 bales consisting of prints, white shirting cloth, and cloth dyed in the piece in many designs. Of this essrs. ftieir Toeg &amp; Joseph Moshi, agents of the Sovtorgflot, took 999 bales for £14,882. 16. 2., sending subsequently 886 bales up country to Baghdad, and remaining with 113 on their hands for local consumption in southern Iraq. There now remains a balance of 1,538 bales on hand in bonded port premises, which, with the 113 in Messrs, eir Toeg &amp; Joseph oshi’s hands, shows a total of 1,651 bales. 7. Seeing how quickly former consignments of U. .S.R• cotton piece goods (small ones, it is true: were disposed of in the Basra bazaars, it may now be wondered why the present consignment has apparently been a drug on the mar :et. The reason, however, is a simple if twofold one, restin ; upon the facts that (1) these U.S.S.H. piece goods are bright-coloured ones suitable for the spring and summer, not for the winter which is now drawing to a close, and that (ii) it has been observed that the qu ality....•4. quality of U.S.S.H. piece ooods arriving at Ba^ra during past seven or eight months has been inferior to that of the earlier 'wheedle' consignments. Retailers have been perturbed by this and are diverting their attention to Japanese products which are of better quality and avail able at a price only negligibly higher. Recent Russian prints have been noticed too to be of fading colour. 8 . It will be interesting at this point to summarise briefly the course of U.S.S.R. cotton piece goods penetration into Iraq via Basra and the Persian Gulf Ports since its inception. The following table will show how the goods reached Basra, the manner of their disposal, and the balance on hand at Basra, in bond and bazaar, at the present time (end of February, 1932). Item.

Owing to difficulties experienced with the Customs Authorities a couplet© return o, all U.S.S.Ja. merchandise arrivin 0 by river craft from hohammera has up till now not been possible. Complete information has now been secured and in Appendix I attached to this memorandum wi11 be found a complete summary of all U.S.S.R. ^oods which have reached Basra by steamer direct or by river craft ex iv’ohanuaera since the beginning of 1928.

It is rumeurod as usual tlmt Jovtorgflot are dissatisfied with the above ment ioned- agents because they (dovtorgflot) believe that a British Shipping firm in daera, intert;sted in freight for the Had 3ea and the Mediterranean ports, hiive impeded th* dovtorgfiot busiraaa activities of Messrs. Mai r foeg anc Joseph Mo ah i by the payment to them of a certain ou.'i of nom^ , said to be in the neighbourhood of fifteen thousand pounds* although on the face of it th&lt; story is absurd, it ia nevertheless given as an indiaation of the type of basaai 4 gossip io which doviet activities in these parts give rise.

Ltd. &amp; the Russian Competition:-~ The Political Agent, Kuwait has reported as follows: - During the month of September mysterious consignments of cheap petrol appeared on the Kuwait market which apparently were imported by a certain shopkeeper and sold with the knowledge of His Excellency the Shaikh. The petrol is sold at Rs.3/- per tin as against Rs.5/4/- charged by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company^ local Agent. The cheap petrol is sold in Anglo-Persiam Oil Company’s tins obviously filled from some other source as the soldering is very crudely done. The Shaikh has told the Political Agent that he suspects it to be stolen Anglo Persian Oil Company’s petrol and that it comes across from Persia in dhows. The Political Agent on the contrary believes it to be of Soviet origin, either brought down by lorry from North Persia or by Soviet ships to Mohammerah. Most of this cheap petrol is good high grade ’’stuff”, but in perhaps a dozen tins two will turn out dirty and of yellow colour. Some tins also contain short weight. There is a great demand for the cheap petrol by local taxi drivers and the Anglo Persian Oil Company would do well to watch the matter. There is no doubt that pirated Soviet petrol would have no sale in Kuwait, were it not for the high prices maintained by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The latter Company according to the Shaikh are doing themselves much harm in the Gulf by their high charges.OB. By Air Mall.

It is therefore presumed that it will consequently have to be directed for disposal at Baghdad. 14 bags of Coffee meant for the Baghdad market have gone forward for duty payment there. 5, The s.s. ^Samoyed' sailed from Basra on October 8 , with a cargo of dates, grain, wool, etc., amounting to 2316,679 metric tons approximately and representing a value of about £. 2,000 in freightage, a considerable increase over the freightage realised by other Soviet vessels this year, and representing so much freightage lost to the homeward competing shipping, in particular to the British vessels plying to this port.

With regard to bent v/ood chairs, zinc covered C 6 I 0 sheets, wood planks, cement, and cotton piecegoods, referred to in para graphs 2, 6 and 7 of the previous circular, the market position has since entirely changed and at present is as detailed below'— Bent Wood Chairs - These chairs have now all been sold thanks to their cheapness and the absence of similar articles from the market. The prices remained the same vizt- Rs,45/- per dozen chairs-without—arms and Rs »72/ per dozen chairs—with-arms. Zinc covered C n I n Sheets - The price of these has now doubled on account of their demand at the present time, and the present stock has been considerably reduced. Wood Planks. - The wood planks which had arrived in Basra from time to time by Soviet vessels, have, it is stated, now been put on sale by a local firm at the market prices current for other timber planks thus profiting by the difference between the Russians proposed price and the price at which they are actually sold. It is reported that a considerable amount of these planks have now been sold. Cement„ — The remaining stocks of the Soviet cement in Basra have now entirely been disposed of, some of it at even a higher price than before Rs, 8 /- (l2sh) per cask, and Rs,2/- (3sh) to Rs,2/4 (S3/4„5d) per bag, although its inferior quality was made known to its purchasers by the dealers in other foreign cement, apparently Iraqi buyers prefer cheapness even at the cost of quality and durability, Ro further consignment of Russian cement has as yet 5.I r arrived in this country hut it is believed that any new arrivals will find ready buyers if sold at the previous price. Cotton -piece goods - At the moment there are no Soviet cotton prints available in Basra, the previous consignment having been easily sold within a month and a half after its display in the market, 7, The cargo landed at Basra by s.s. '‘Samoyed” on her previous trip to this port, viz. May 13 last, with the exception of 6 f 990 pieces of timber which are kept at Basra, has all been forwarded to the Baghdad area for disposal there, 8 . The importation of Soviet goods into Iraq from the neighbouring Persian town of Mohammerah has now entirely stopped as a result of the enforcement of the Persian Trade Monopoly Law.Copy* (E 5469/408/^5). tL2-. a j^‘ 18th October, 1931. /-» i{y i&gt;orci, I have the honour to report that Monsieur Tur&amp;koulov left JedUa yesterday on what he telle me la a six months leave or absence* He intends to spend It In Leningrad instead orth his native Turkestan* X have gained the impression that hie return to Jed.© will be cauditioned by the , progress made in Soviet negotiations Tor the entry of Russian goods to thie country. 2.

The Russians have virtually controlled the market in sugar and piece goods, adversely affecting to a very serious extent the British and Indian textile market. In a' period of unprecedented trade depression accentuated by the hampering restrictions of the Government exchange control laws, they have very notably increased their imports throu,fdi Bushire. Nine Russian steamers celled in the course of the year and landed 79,452 bags of sugar, (in 1308, 57108 bags and 574 cases) 5056 bales of piece goods, (1308, 4584 bales) and 2813 cases of matches (1308, 2591 cases) besides some 3658 packages of miscellaneous cargo. i.he Russian advance in the Gulf does not only constitute a very serious menace to British interests in Persia, but also affects the British India Steam Navigation Company^ position as the principal carriers in these waters. The very heavy decline in this Company*s freights for Persian ports has given them seriously to think of late and the fact that Russian steamers are now bringing in such large quantities of sugar, piece goods etc., and so accentuated the dearth in freight, constitutes a by no means negligible contributory factor. The outlook for British trade is not promising. In the Russians it is faced with a competitor, actuated by political rather than economic motives, who has presumably come to stay, while signs are not wanting that the Japanese are only waiting a favourable opportunity to enter the field. The success which has of late attended their activities in the Arab Coast markets has been most marked and if maintained it seems not unlikely that Japanese steamers will put in an appearance in the Gulf before long. The American Silver Line is expected to commence sailinga direct to the United States of America during the coming date season. The Russians - their tr ading methods - popularity - success or f ailur e. The year has seen a great strengthening of the Russian position, the unsettled state of conditions throughout the year having suited their book well. The scope and importance of their Bushire office was greatly extended early in the year. Apart from their obvious eagerness to obtain as much foreign exchange as possible their methods suggest that the business or financial aspects of their organisation are of very secondary importance, the main policy at present being to disturb the market as much as possible. The general atmosphere of uncertainty Induced by the Government's exchange policy must have greatly helped them to attain their end while the difficulties experienced by merchants to obtain foreign exchange for imports enabled them on the whole to achieve their objects without the need to extend long credit or sell at absurdly low prices. At the beginning of the year their raising of prices and policy of selling only for the sterling prevented their doing much business - in August however, they gave up trying- 2 - to sell only against foreign exchange and embarked on a policy of upsetting the sugar market tfhioh had by that time become the centre of the speculative activities of the whole merchant coomiunity, providing as 11 did practically the only means left to the smaller fry of turning over their money. In the autumn and latter part of the year they required krans to finance their exports of gum, nuts, wool, ate. and again started extending credit and accepting currency in payment, Practically all their local sales of sugar and piece goods were made to ffaji Rais. They are not popular in Bushire and most merchants are chary of dealing with them unless they see opportunity for certain profit, since they realise they cannot be trusted to keep their word. Heji Rais for example was badly let down, and not for the first time, at the end of the i ear when, having recently purchased some 15,000 bags of sugar off them on the understanding they would leave him a clear field, he found them under selling him in the local market.Notes.

Ho efforts whatever are being made by the agents, Me.ir Toeg and Joseph Moshi, to dispose of these stocks at a lower x-ate tn&amp;n the current market price since Messrs, keir Toeg and Joseph Moshi themselves hold large stocks of other foreign timber which they cannot affox'd to sell at tne px'ices proposed by the uussians. 3 .

His Britannic Majesty's Representative presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of the document mentioned below on the subject of the threatened crisis in the motor trade in Persia :— Mr. Tollinton’s despatch No. Overseas Trade (B.)-65, dated June 15th, 1929, to the Department of Overseas Trade. Copy to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq, printed letter No. 164, of June 15th, 1929. p S '—iThe noteto the status report mentioned in the above despatch is as follows :— “ It is generally felt there will shortly be a slump in motor trade in Iraq and Persia and caution is necessary”. Letter from the Officer in-charge Commercial Affairs, British Legation, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. Overseas Trade (B.)-65, dated the 15th June 1929. I have the honour to inform you that according to the information at my disposal a serious crisis is threatened in the motor trade in Persia, largely owing to the overimportation of vehicles by some of the most prominent firms engaged in the trade, and in part owing to the scarcity of freights resulting from the recent disturbances in Southern Persia and the consequent closing of the Shiraz-Bushire road. 2. Messrs. Zieglers, who are agents for General Motors of the United States of America, are credibly reported to have upwards of 500 vehicles in the Customs godowns at Bushire, while a lesser number is said to be held there by Messrs. Kettaneh, the agents for Dodge motors. A representative of the General Motors -Company is at the present time in Persia, but it is not yet known whether his com pany will be able to see’’’their way to help Messrs. Zieglers. The latter firm though generally believed to be solidly established, if unaided, seem bound to be hard hit. 3. The positioh is further complicated by the fact that when it becomes pos sible to bring the vehicles up country, the slump in motor prices in the provinces and Tehran, will render sales extremely difficult. This is borne out by a statement made to me privately by the owner of a new omnibus which had, he said, been sold to him by Messrs. Zieglers for 150 Tomans down, the rest to be paid in eleven monthly instalments. The agent for Berliet motors is also reported to be in diffi culties, and the Ford agent informed me personally that he had instructed his firm to ship no more vehicles to Persia for some months to come. 4. In this connection I have the honour to refer to the note to the status report, forwarded under cover of my despatch No. Overseas Trade (B.)-66 of to-day s date, which may be taken to represent the views of a reliable local authority. / 5. A cony of this despatch is being sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Govern- hient of India and His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq.

RED INTRIGUES IN ARABIA. MANY DISGUISES. (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) When the Bolshevists met with a rebufl in China they intensified their campaign in Southern Asia and the Arabian world. Their experience in the Far East profited them there, and local conditions were favourable to their subversive schemes. The Third International has a well- organized intelligence service, and the native members of the party in Moscow and the various so-called trading oi’ganiza- tions keep it well informed on all that is passing in any region, even the most A remote, where they propose to ■work. But Moslem fanaticism and hatred of foreigners made the hitherto unworked field of Arabia difficult and dangerous ground for the Bolshevists. When they failed to establish official diplomatic delegations, the Bolshevists tempted the more or less independent States with the bait of commercial rela tions. Thus in 1924 there began to appear in the Mohamedan world a series of ‘ companies ” founded in Moscow, which differed from each other only in their titles. In addition to the notorious Arcos there were Russo-Turk, Kara Deniz (the ^ Black Sea), Vostotorg (Eastern Com merce), Shark and others. These com- ^ panics usually sheltered under a foreign ^ flag and were managed by keen and a energetic young Communists. They a appeared one after another in a regular a succession in all the Arab countries. Their a only purpose was to stir up trouble. .

The Egyptian police have their eyes open, and' when these boats put into Port Saicj and Alexandria only tho captain is allowed ashore In the Hejaz an agent from Moscow appeared as early as 1924 with a full dip lomatic mission accredited to the Court of King Hussein. The mission was main tained until the end of 1928, in spite of all the wars and vicissitudes of the country, thanks to the address of the Soviet Con- eul-General, Kerim Hakimotf. This man, who is an interesting character, calls him self Hakim Khan. A Turcoman by birth, he is able to take part m Moslem functions and performed the pilgrimage to Mecca every year while other European repre sentatives were unable to leave Jeddah. Gradually Hakimoff got into touch with the discontented elements in many Mos lem countries. His mission extended its influence all over the Dutch East Indies and the Red Sea basin. At his suggestion Moscow instituted in 1927 regular sail ings of Soviet boats from the Mediter ranean through Suez to Jeddah at low prices for the pilgrims to Jeddah. Every year “ floating Soviet exhibitions ” into the Red Sea and Persian Gulf advertise the attainments of the Soviet Government in industry. The goods are sold at about half cost-price, on the principle that com merce is not an end in itself but a political weapon. MOSCOW AND THE YEMEN. A branch of Russo-Turk was opened in 1927 in the Soviet Consulate at Jeddah, under the management of Byelkin, but his clumsy methods soon attracted the attention of the Government of the Wahabi King, Ibn Saud, and he was expelled with his whole staff. The Komintern immediately supplied the deficiency by a representative of Vostotorg. In the summer of 1928 there was a marked increase in the activity of the Bolshevists in Arabia. The new Kingdom of Sana’ and the Soviet Government recognized each other, as a result of the secret negotiations of Hakimoff and the Imam Yahya. A diplomatic mission from the Soviets soon made its appearance in Sana’, under the direction of Astakhoff, Hakimoff’s former secretary, and Byelkin. who had been expelled from the Hojaz. These “ diplomats ” are not the repre sentatives of the Russian people, but of the Komintern. Arabia Feiix also re joices, after centuries of isolation, not only in a Soviet diplomatic mission, but in a branch of Vostotorg at Hodeida. As the Arabs have not the remotest con ception of the true motives of the Russians their tactics are meeting with success. Already the Arabian East looks upon the Bolshevists as natural friends and allies, on the principle that Moscow is the enemy of England, and “ the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” The apparently inexplic able friction between the Wahabis and Iraq and Transjordania and the all too fre quent hostilities along the frontier, which are liable at any minute to involve the British Government, can definitely be ascribed to Bolshevist machinations. The disturbances round Aden coincided sus piciously with the conclusion of an agree ment. between the Soviets and the Imam of Sana’. The development of the Bolshevist schemes is shown by the transfer of their seat of operations from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. This move is connected with the enlarged plan of operations of the Soviet Consulate at Jeddah, where in November last the management was taken over by a bigger man than Hakimoff, a well-known orientalist named Tiurakuloff, one of the leading spirits of the Scientine Association for Oriental Studies in Mos cow. Simultaneously with his arrival in the Hejaz there appeared in the Persian Gulf the steamer Tomp from Odessa with a new “ exhibition of Soviet products,” under the command of Moses Axelrod, who had little difficulty in establishing a Soviet agency in one of the ports of southern Persia under the modest name of ” Russian-Persian Export and Import Company.” Axelrod’s activities are fdready beginning to show results.

'From the papers on page 6 of the present correspondence, you will see that the Government of India, on receipt of the despatch m rv^etrion, raised the question whether a special arrangement under which Soviet agents at Bushire and elsewhere cleared their goods without simultaneous payment of duties, but apparently on subsequent payments after local realisation, afforded any ground for making a representation to the Persian Government under the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of 1928 or Article 9 of the Treaty of 1857. It proved that the arrangement in question had applied only in the case of the S.S. 'Tobolsk', and that similar facilities would not in future be accorded.The question of representations to the Persians has therefore been dropped. ,In its particular bearing on Indian manufactures I have the honour to transmit for the information of the Government of India a copy of my despatch ho.91 to the \ British Charge d’Affaires at Tehran on the subject of the disturbing Mumping' of cotton piece-goods by the Soviet trading organization, and their underselling of corresponding British and Indian manufactures. I regret tnat the samples brought have had to be cut into several portions. I have etc., V Sd. H.G.Chick. The Secretary to the Government of India in the foreign and Political Department,No .91. British Consulate, Shiraz, 5th November 1928. Sir, In continuation of my despatch No.88 I have the honour to forward samples of new lines of cotton goods launched by the Soviet organization ’Sharq* on the market here. it will be noticed that it is no longer a question of prints only, but of other classes of manufactures as well, in which their ‘dumped* and subsidized goods are challenging the old estaolished predominance of the Manchester and Bombay mills. 2 . The prices of sale by the “Sharq” ana retail, as given by the person who procured these samples for me, are as follows; because of the difference in widths with standard British ana Indian goods it is difficult for traders here to make a true comparison of prices. This could only be correctly established by our manufacturers. But it would appear that proportionately the rates of the Soviet agency are far below those as-ced for British goods of the same class.

A prominent merchant has just given me the news that by the third Soviet Russian steamer to arrive at Bushire in jdoi the past four months, the 'Communist M (?) ,5000-five thousand- bales of piece goods have been brought : a figure which, if confirmed by the Residency and Consulate General, is almost incredible, and even menacing, in the extent of the ’dumping* it implies in this already overstocked and dull market. I submit that the competent authorities in the United Kingdom and India should pay urgent and serious attention to what this portends, and devise means to prevent the harm becoming irreparable: were it open to the Soviet Government to’dump' its cottons and other goods in Karachi and Bombay, what damage would they not cause to existing interetsl and is not such a move more than a likelihood, were diplomatic and full trading relations to be restored? The means to be found may imply the cutting of prices, and finan cial loss by our merchants for a time, if this market is to be saved from Soviet Russian domination. And I once more taice the opportunity to emphasize the detriment caused to British and ^ndian imports of cotton-goods,duties on which have to be ■ '&gt; P *idB ndividual Persian imported oy the Soviet agency at t ^ Bushire, etc, oeing allowed to clear the goods without paying duties and finding the money locally, because of a special arrangement made between the Soviet and Persian governments in Tehran. 4. I beg leave to quote in the above connection the following extract from the ,, Times ,, :- 'SOVIET DUMPING OP TEXTILES'. 'FORCED EXPORT' POLICY (Prom our Correspondent. Riga.September 25). 'A report has been published in Moscow on the results of the efforts made by the Soviet Government in 1927-28 to capture the textile trade with the Eastern market from British, Czechoslovak Polish and other competitors. TheThe report states tnat the chief markets attacked were Persia, Afghanistan, China, Mongolia and Eastern Turkey,and that the quantity of textiles exported to (.the Bast this year is already approximately the same as in 1913. In Western China and Mongolia Soviet textiles met with little competition hut in Persia Soviet products have to compete closely with British products. “The progress in the Persian market is considered most satis factory ,however, and Soviet textiles are aoout to invade districts in the South Persian zone to which Russian textiles did not penetrate before the War. The report adds tnat plans have been completed for systematic efforts in 1928-29 to secure for Soviet textiles, especially cottons, a firm fckijcxHg; footing in the Baltic States. Soviet firms are following the example of British manufacturers as regards attractive outward appearance and packing. The report strikes tne average citizen of Moscow or Leningrad as grotesque,since it is most difficult to find any sort of textiles there, and when found,their purchase entails standing in queues, some times for several days in succession, with the risk of the goods oeing confiscated and the purchaser arrested for M speculation*' before reaching home. But besides political considerations, efforts to sell textiles abroad are part of the plan recently approved by the Supreme Economic Council for the 'forced export of secondary products', in order A to obtain the foreign currency originally expected from the export of £pci.iX grain. The 'forced export' policy insists on the penetration of markets, irrespective of whether the transaction are commercially profitable. The prices obtained abroad are therefore always much below the prices prevailing in the USSR and usually considerably under the actual cost of » production. 5.

To enable the Government of India to consider whether this special arrangement in any way conflicts with the Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty signed on xOth May 1928, or with article 9 of the treaty of 1857 or otherwise affords any ground for making a representation to the Persian Government, they would be glad to be furnished, if possible, with full particulars regarding it.

CONFIDENTIAL. 12167 1029 , Section 1. ^3 1011/119/34] No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—[Received February 25.) &lt;4. (No. 60.) Sir, Tehran, January 31, 1929. IN my despatch No. 32, Confidential, of the 17th January, I had the honour to bring to your notice the views held by the Soviet Embassy here on the success of their trade relations with Persia. Complaints which are heard, however, from Persian merchants trading with Russia lead one to believe that the Persian view of these trade relations is somewhat different. In this connexion I enclose herewith translation of an article which appeared in the Tehran newspaper, “ Shafaq Sorkh,” a few days ago, and which serves to illustrate how Soviet laws and regulations hamper the free course of trade between the two countries. 2. It will be seen that when the Persian merchant has finally obtained possession of a licence to import his goods into Soviet Russia, he is obliged to take in exchange Soviet merchandise for 90 per cent, of the amount realised from the sale of his goods. He is not, however, free to choose what Soviet merchandise he wishes to take in exchange. Were he free he would undoubtedly buy sugar and oil and its by-products, which command a ready sale in Persia. The Soviet, however, reserves for itself the importation into Persia and the sale there of such goods as these, which can be turned readily into cash, and the Persian trader has to choose other goods, such as iron, nails, enamel-ware, and such things, for which there is no really pressing demand, and which may lie on his hands for a very long time before he can realise their value. . • 3. There is, again, as the article points out, a mass of rules and regulations to be complied with and papers and proofs to be obtained before the unhappy merchant can finally complete the exchange and obtain the remaining 10 per cent, of the transaction in cash. This 10 per cent, is probably more than swallowed up in freight and other charges, and the Persian is, indeed, lucky if, in addition, he is not obliged to pay out some money from his own pocket in order to bring back his goods to their destination. 4. It is true that the Persian merchant is now paid his 10 per cent, in krans and not in chervontsi, but the manager of the Imperial Bank told me yesterday that he estimated at several millions the amount of chervontsi still in North Persia. The buying rate in the bazaar was 19 and the par rate 50 krans. The Russian bank refused to buv at either rate. If they bought at 19 they were helping still further to depreciate the Russian currency; if they paid 50 krans for what was only worth 19, they would soon be bankrupt. 1 5. I asked Mr. Wilkinson if there was not a large smuggling traffic. He understood that the Soviet authorities had now taken such precautions that this traffic had become very dangerous. A copy of this despatch has been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &lt;£c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure in No. 1. Extract from the “Shafaq Sorkh ” of January 20, 1929.

IN view of the fact that Persian merchants are discontented at the way they are treated by the Soviet officials in the matter of business and trade, and as this matter has attracted the attention of the press in Tehran and the Chamber of Commerce, I [716 bb—1]interviewed the director of the Foreign Money Section of the Soviet Finance Commissariat, who, in reply to my questions, said :— “ In conformity with the fifth article of the Perso-Soviet Commercial Treaty, since the 1st October, 1927, only 10 per cent, of the value oi tie goo s imported from Persia will be paid for in cash, in foreign currency, on con i ion^ that for the remaining 90 per cent, the merchants take Soviet goods in exchang This has been paid to all Persian merchants since the conclusion of the treaty. Seeing that the Finance Commissariat has special laws for foreign currency, there is a proviso that anyone desiring to get a draft in foreign currency from the Soviet National Bank must obtain the approval of the Council of the I mance Commissariat “ The Finance Commissariat has facilitated the business of Persian merchants in accordance with the fifth article of the commercial treaty, and as soon as they (Persian merchants) show their documents proving the importation of their goods and the receipt of Soviet products in exchange for 90 per cent, of the value of their goods, they immediately receive the equivalent of 10 per cent, cost of the goods in the form of a draft from the bank. (The complaint oi tne merchants is due to this very reason, for apparently the Finance Commissar creates many difficulties regarding what sort of documents must be shown by the merchants.) The merchants interested have been already fully informed in this respect both by the Soviet and the Persian Chambers of Commerce. “ As regards other Persian subjects who do not benefit by the fifth article of the treaty, they have been and will be treated in accordance with the general rules and regulations.” The Central Executive Committee, on the 29th March, 1928, ruled that those who reside permanently in the Soviet Union can, when travelling to foreign countries, obtain a draft amounting to 300 roubles in foreign currency, and each extra person whose name is mentioned on their passports, may receive a draft for 150 roubles in addition. This law applies to those whose residence in Soviet Russia shall not have been less than eighteen months. Those who are in the Soviet territories only temporarily can take away with them on their departure only the monev which they brought when they arrived in Soviet Russia on condition that they produce a certificate stating the amount they had with them at the time of their arrival. It is also stipulated that such people shall not remain more than two months in Russia, otherwise 10 roubles per day for each day of their stay in Russia in excess of the two months will be deducted from the amount which they are allowed to exchange. As regards Persian workers who are employed in Soviet industries and oil-fields, they can buy drafts for 25 per cent, of their wages. As regards Persians who for a long time have been residents of Russia, I asked if they could buy drafts for the money which they amassed from the sale of their properties and furniture when they were returning to Persia, and in reply he said that no law had yet been enacted for this, and drafts would be only issued to those categories mentioned above.

As stated in paragraph 1 of the submission on P. 295, the subject in question is one on which orders would more appropriately issue to the Political Resident through the Government of India and this Office, and the Colonial Office, with whom the point was discussed demi-officially at the beginning of February, did not then dissent from that view.

Clive to Sir Austen Chamberlain.—[Received February 4.) (No. 3^. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, January 17, 1929. I HAVE the honour to report that on the evening of the 9th January the Soviet Ambassador entertained the leaders, as well as the rank and file, of the Tehran press to dinner. 2. I am told that it was a sumptuous entertainment and was very well managed, and the speech made by the Ambassador, as well as the reply thereto made by Dashti, the editor of the “ Shafagh Sorkh,” was of the kind often engendered by the feeling of contentment which follows gastronomical satisfaction. 3. The Ambassador was so happy at the apparent success of the entertainment that he began his speech by a promise that the entertainment would be an annual one. He then reviewed Perso-Soviet relations of the past year and expressed great satisfaction. He dwelt on the period that had elapsed since the Perso-Soviet Treaty of 1921, and ascribed to that treaty of equality the success that had since attended Persia’s efforts to abolish “ unequal ” treaties with the rest of the world, especially the “ imperialistic ” Governments. The press, he asserted, had also played its part in educating Persian opinion up to that standard of equality. He had not much use for the foreign press, which he accused of continually spreading false news about the Soviet internal situation. To correct the erroneous impression made by articles of the foreign press he advised his audience to read the Soviet journals, which were the organs enjoying the greatest liberty of criticism of any country in the world. Having made this most extraordinary statement, M. Davtian went on to review Perso-Soviet trade for 1928, which, he said, had amounted to 140 million roubles. He described this as a great success, and expatiated on the fact that the sound economic situation of the Soviet was one of the greatest factors for the development of Persian trade. Trade and commerce went hand-in-hand with politics, and if trade relations were flourishing it could be taken for granted that political relations were good. He stated that the Soviet policy towards Persia was immutable, and that Persia, when faced with a serious situation, could always rely on the friendly help of the Soviet. 4. Dashti replied, as might have been expected, by extolling the heroic deeds of the Persian press and the friendly attitude adopted both in commerce and politics towards Persia by Soviet Russia. 5. After dinner the Ambassador withdrew into an inner room accompanied by the editors of the three most important Tehran papers, and I enclose herewith a memorandum of what is stated to have passed there between them. This information was communicated to a member of my staff by one of the guests. 6. Reports have been received previously of “ commercial presents ” being made by the Soviet Embassy to Persians from whom favours in return might be expected, but the help extended to the Persian press had usually taken the form either of monthly payments in cash or a lump sum paid for some special purpose. It may be that the Soviet are not satisfied with the results obtained by the former methods ; the article which recently appeared in the “Iran,” translation of which I had the honour to transmit to you under cover of my despatch No. 521, Confidential, of the 19th December, caused a great flutter in the Soviet dovecots. In any case, the grant of licences to export Persian merchandise to Soviet Russia will save money for the Embassy here, and it will be the Persian merchant who will in reality pay the price of the favours bestowed on the press by the Soviet Ambassador. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. F 1 798 February 4, 1929. Section 5. No. 1. [716 d—5]Enclosure in No. 1. Soviet Embassy Dinner to the Press on January 9, 1929. AFTER dinner, 1 am informed that there was a private meeting betvvf M. Davtian and certain Soviet commercial officials and the editors of the three principal Tehran papers: (1) Rahnama of the “Iran,” (2) Dashti of the “ Shafagh Sorkh,” and (3) Itissam Zadeh of the “ Setareh Iran.” These three papers have received material help and support from the Soviet Embassy in the past either by subsidies or monetary gifts or by the sale of paper at cost price or less. Latterly another way of helping them has been found, and that is by the gift to them of licences to import into Russia certain quantities of goods for sale. It will be remembered that the import of goods into Russia from Persia is governed by the issue of licences up to a certain amount in every year. It is a system laid down by the October 1927 Commercial Convention between Persia and Russia, and all Persian merchants are supposed to be able to obtain these licences so long as the total quantity of the goods in question does not exceed the amount stipulated in the convention. Any person not a merchant to whom the Soviet Embassy wishes to show favour receives a present in this form. He then goes to the bazaar, gets into touch with a merchant who deals in the goods for which such a licence is made out and who may have a stock of such merchandise in hand, and sells it to him for cash. The merchant armed with the licence sends his goods to Russia ; if he is lucky he makes a profit; very often he makes a loss. The Soviet in this way kills two birds with one stone. It carries out its part of the trade convention with Persia and it subsidises a newspaper. The licence is always of value to the journalist as he turns it into cash ; it is not alw r ays so valuable to the merchant, who not infrequently makes a loss. It may be asked why, once having made a loss, the merchant continues to try his luck. The answer is that not all of them make losses and the unlucky one hopes to be luckier next time. Moreover, he has the goods in hand ; it is merchandise from which he makes a living, and there is no sale for his goods except in Russia. He therefore has to send them there and hope for the best. I am informed that on this occasion all three journalists received presents of licences—one for a consignment of henna, another for a consignment of skins, and the third for a consignment of dried fruits—each one, I am told, being worth anything from 5,000 to 10,000 tomans.

As we control the Sheikh's foreign relations, we should have to take vis -a- vis the Soviet the responsibility for his action whetEer it was taken on our advice or not. The Foreign Office evidently feel that it would be difficult to justify restrictions greater than those obtaining in this country.

The subject dealt with in it is one on which orders would more appropriately issue to the Political Resident through the Government of India and this Office (\diich dealt with the precisely similar question raised in 1925-26 in regard to the entry of German nationals into Gulf port!*), and the Colonial Office - with whom the point has been discussed demi-officially - would, it is understood, see no objection to the India Office takin^ over responsibility. Action has, however, been delayed until it could be seen what the Foreigi Office had to say, they having indicated that they were not disposed to go so far as the Colonial Office suggested in paragraph 2 of their letter. 'the Foreign Office have now communicated demi-officially the draft to the Colonial Office submitted herewith. They explain that the Northern Department are averse to taking a strongly anti- — Russian line, and hope that we will not press them to* %ree with the Colonial Office. The question is one of policy. My own feeling is that at a time when '■e are doing our utmost to counteract Russian ici/iviuies in the Gulf, when the Political Resident has been expressly instructed by the Foreign Office to submit a report on the best means of counteracting such activities, and when His Majesty's Government are not in diplomatic relations with the Soviet | Government, we are not called on to do anything to facilitate Soviet trade with the Gulf ports, •'hile^- 3222a 5000 11/28 therefore/therefore, it is true that there is no question of allowing members of the crew of Soviet vessels to 4 land in Bahrein, etc., I should have thou^it that we midit well take advantage of the Sheikh of Bahrein's attitude, and reply rather on the lines suggested in paragraph 2 of the Colonial Office letter.

It seems clear that the Pus sians are j adopting up-to-date business methods, and that, in the absence of , much keener interest; than is at present shown by competing British firms (and possibly also by competing firms in India;, they may, though at considerable expense to their ' overnment, develop a considerable market in tne area in question.

BRITISH LEGATION, Tehran, Hovembor 16th, 1928. P U W 4 Enol* 1. Enol* 2&gt; In xy despatch Ho* Overseas Trade (B) 72 of July 26th last I had the honour to report on the arrival of S*S. Tobolsk at Bandar Abbas on June ISthand to put forward certain oonsiderations relevant to the resumption of Russian sailings to the Persian Gulf. Tvid more Russian ships have arrived since then* The S.S* Michael Frunze discharged 23,000 packages at Bushire on October 17th of which 20,000 were sugar, 2,000 timber and 1000 sundries, while the S.S. Communist put in at the same port on October 31st and is understood to have landed 9,000 packages consisting of sugar, piece-goods, matches and sundries* The latter vessel was equipped with a well-stocked canteen and Petsians were invited to visit the ship and make what purchases they required. The invitation did not meet with much response as the local worthies were not anxious to part with their savings in the form of boat hire. However that may be the appearance of these two steamers in the Gulf warrants an examination being made of the fate of the goods landed by the Tobolsk and the impression they have made on the markets of South Persia. The attached copies of reports by His Majesty^ Consuls at Kerman and Shiraz are of considerable assistance in forming an idea of the situation. Judging by the evidence at one^ disposal, the Soviets are bent on dumping sugar especially in South Persia but whereas the introduction of Russian leaf on a large scale has induced the lindu traders of Kerman to reduce their orders in India from 30,000 hags last year to 2,000 bags this year, His ia^esty's Acting Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in the DEPARTMBHT OF OVERSEAS TRADE. RussianRussian loaf sugar has failed to command a ready sale in Pars and Bushire as it is not considered sweet enough for the local trade. 3. It seems that Persakhar can only supply South Persia with sugar hy rationing the northern provinces. The Russians in the latter are showing themselves reluctant to give sugar in exchange for Persian products. (One immediate result has Been that a small consignment of Belgian sugar was recently forwarded to Hamadan from Kermanshah for the first time in two years.) Eis Majesty's Consul at Tabriz states that Russia now pays only 45 - 50$ in sugar instead of 90$ as heretofore, 15-20$ in prints, 10$ in Erans at the official Russian Bank rate and the balance in such secondary commodities as tin, iron, cement, etcetera - oil products continuing to be distributed independently. This departure is much resented by Persian merchants who found sugar the nearest approach to a cash commodity they could obtain from Russia while the market for prints, which the Soviet organizations are particularly fond of thrusting upon Borth Persia at the moment, is grossly ovorstocked. 4. It is significant that in 1927-28 Russia's exports of pure cotton goods to Persia were almost as important as her sugar exports to this country (57 as against G9 million Krans) while the ratio in the two preceding years was as one to three. This change in the relative values of Russia's staple articles of export to Persia was brought about by a 100$ increaee in the value of Persia's takings of Russian cottons in the course of last year and &amp; 20$ decrease in the o.i.f. value of the Russian sugar absorbed (in spite of a 19$ increase in weight). *&gt;• In South Persia Russian cottons already enjoy the same popularity as in the North. This faot is well broughtout in the enoloeures to this despatch as well as in other reports. Mr. Daries stresses the 78# reduotion in the orders for ootton piece goods placed hy Kerman! importers in Manchester and India while Mr. Chick draws attention to the variety of the piece goods marketed hy the Russians in Pars. He instances Italian twills, gray and white shirtings (apart from prints) and, in another report 'a species of silk, 60 inches hroad, sold hy Sharq at Krans 50 per metre'. Mr. Davies also mentions satin, poplin and art silk fancies. I might add that the Russianshave been busy for some time collecting samples of every kind of textile for which there is a demand in Persia. 6 * Mr « Chick makes a further plea for the active combination of British and British Indian interests against Russian encroachments in the Persian Qulf which I beg to leave to endorse - if at all feasible in practice. His first, in iiovember 1927, was only concerned with sugar and in this respect the Department of Overseas Trade pointed out, in its despatch Ho.l (24417/1927) of the 18th January, 1928, that 'the only British interest involved in the present supplies of sugar to Persia is the brokerage which is too small to be reduced in an effort to make the price of sugar other than Russian competitive'. The Department also stated that it was not prepared to approach the shipping lines as these were (then) to be regarded as a virtual monopoly whose only interest in the question was that of carrying sugar regardless of its origin. I submit that the issues at stake now reach much further, even from the purely commercial aspect - and I cannot pretend to deal with any other. If the Russians choose to pay attention to the varying requirements of South Persia it may no ,C\._ rno longer Toe a question for British shipping lines of carrying sugar regardless of its origin hut of having any sugar to carry at all. Moreover if British trade is only indirectly interested in the sugar consumed in the Gulf area, including its hinterland, it would he very directly affected hy the loss of a piece gtiods market which Lancashire nowadays cannot afford to despise. I see little hope of cooperation at the Persian end, especially now that Messrs. Ziegler have retired from the piece-goods market, hut it does seem advisable that representatives of the British manufacturers, shippers and shipping lines interested should meet to discuss the situation and frame a common policy, preferably under the auspices of the Department of Overseas Trade. A similar procedure might he followed in India. It cannot do any harm and may do good, although I am personally inclined to doubt the possibility and the willingness of those British industrial, oommeroial and shipping interests immediately affected to keep prices down to the Russian selling point for any length of time. In the case of cotton piece-goods prices might have to be brought down even lower than the Russian to find buyers. The Soviets make a point of going the whole hog in commercial as in other matters. Should he he prepared to follow them as far as they choose to go in this particular instance? or should he bless our competitors for undercutting us to so gratuitous an extent (25-30$) and wait till they have hanged themselves to re-enter into what we have grown to consider our own? If the hanging process is to he hastened it is clear that someone will he required to foot the hill.i -5- 7. Hegarding the question (to which Hr. Chick alludes) of the payment in Tehran of the dues levied on Hussian goods imported hy the southern ports in virtue of a special arrangement hetween the Soviet Embassy and the Persian Government, I venture to suggest that this scheme must fall to the ground if foreign and Persian firms should claim similar privileges. I propose to try to arrange for such claims to be lodged with the Persian Customs within the next few days.

There is a great demand in Ac man for Indian Check oloth but, d^c to Jthfc closure of mills in Bombay, the Hindu traders hare* not received any fresh stocks for the last two months.

On the other hand a local British merchant considers that in time Russian sugar is likely to supplant its competitors in the 'Iraq market.

The attitude of the Iraq Government, as described in the extract from their Economic Report now submitted, is obviously entirely correct, but a very careful watch will need to be kept, in order to ensure that commercial relations are not in fact made a cover for political propaganda on the part of the Soviet. It is perhaps rather surprising that the existence in Basra of a Soviet trade agency, presumably of some little standing in point of time, should only now have come to light.

The recent arrival of tine Soviet Steaxiiship 'Michael Frunze* at Basrah with a cargo of Soviet goods has produced a number of enquiries from local merchants as to whether the ^raq Oovemment ?/oulci object to their dealing in Russian goods or accepting appointments as Soviet agents. In the meantime it has come to light that a Soviet trade agency is already in existence at Basrah, the fix® being known as *Venilal Bros.* The attitude of the ’Iraq Government is that there is no objection to merchants dealing in Soviet goods provided tnat there is no attempt to make such goods a vehicle tor the importation of political propaganda. For this ^ reason the ’Iraq Government are carefully enquiring into the antecedents of ¥enilal Bros, and an application for permission to visit this agency submitted through His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul Muhammerah by a Mr. Betrenko, described as the Russian Manager of the Soviet Trading Agency, has been refused.

COPY. 23804/1938. y BHITISH LEGATION, GULHAZ. August 24, 1928. Memorandum by the Acting Commercial Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, Subject:- The Persian Market for Piece Goods The following extracts from the reports of His Majesty’s Consular Officers illustrate the situation Meshed (June 1928) ?T Market stagnant and still overstocked, the demanl being for Russian prints and chintzes, which continue to pour in. English and Indian manufacturers only find sale on credit extending from 5 to 6 months.' Resht (July 1928) ’’Opened fairly active but slacken ed during the month, and closed with few buyers.^ Tlie~Russians have been importing but for the interior.” Great dissatisfaction is being shown with the insuffi ciency of the export quotas allowed for Nijni Pair ard to Russia generally with a resultant detrimental effect on the purchasing power of the Province of Gilan. Tabriz (June and July 1928) 'In June the market was very weak , prices were low and there was no money. T&amp;e same may be said of the state of the market in the month of July. Russian prints went up about 15/-' in the course of the month, being practically in the hands of two or three merchants, who had some 1000 bales in stock and were able to command the price. On the other hsnd there are reports current in the bazaar of scarcity of goods &lt; in Russia. According to bazaar gossip, whereas Russia imported about 37000 bales of prints into Persia last year she will only be able to import about 2000 in the year 1928. - Prom another source it is understood that, presumably previous to the 15% rise, Russian prints were selling in the market at the rate of Krans 0.80, 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 per metre terms 6-7 months credit. Similar qualities in London aid ’ Manchester cost about 15$ more, Excluding freight, customs duty, and similar charges.” ^interest to note that the Russian imports of textiles (cottons) into Azerbaijan during the first two some /some find their way to this market, as well as more British through Kermanshah and Hamadan. British textiles however have undoubtedly lost a great deal of ground in Azerbaijan in reoent years. Russian goods have, as seen above, ousted Italian textiles from first place. Hamadan (July 1938) 'Arrivals from Manchester and Bombay during the month totalled approximately 1,000 bales: sales 1,200 bales: and stocks in hand at the end of the month about, 4,500 bales. Demand was slack and prices remained practically unchanged, though white Manchester sheetings advanced slightly at the end of the month. Arrivals from Russia were 1,700 bales: sales, 1,200 bales- and stocks at the end of the month about 600 bales. Prices were unchanged, but business was brisk. This month has thus constituted a landmark in the history of Russian competition in the piece-goods market, since for the first time the consumption of Russian piece-goods has reached the same level Bribisk piece goods. ITTs to be''feared that tnis equality will not be maintained but that the Russians will make even further progress as both the price and quality of their piece-goods are more satisfactory to the Persian buyer. Money is scarce in this market.' Ke rmanshah (July 1928) 'There has been a better inquiry for certain lines of Manchester and Italian goods, but here again merchants are suffering from Russian complex. It is impossible at uresent to say whether the cessation of Russian imports is temporaiy iCermanshah statistics for the ten months ending January 21, 1928, show that the chief importers of textiles into this province by way of 'Iraq were, in millions of Krans, Great Britain 56.6; British India 14.47; Belgium 3.7; Italy 1.5. ihe Russian cottons marketed in Kermanshah, in small quantities only are imported by way of Pahlavi (JSnzeli) and are included in the statistics for that port. Isfahan (July 1928 ) 'A certain amount of activity in the bazaars at th^ beginning of the month relapsed into stagnation on the news tnat the Mejlis has passed the Opium Monopoly.'' Shiraz (July 1928) , ’' T 5 aaer s their wits' end to make a living and depressed by the ever worsening conditions, received another rude blow wnen tne news came through of the passing by the Mejlis of tne Opium Monopoly law, which naturally hits them in Pars - the largest producer of opium among the provinces - more severely here where they are less able to palliate the effects than elsewhere The buying power of the nermi* win be a ? 0 -S?. ider ably reduced.... At ^Eeft^rThe month the 'Sharq 1 agency was selling coloured (Russian) drills at U to 2 Krans per metre, whereas Italian drills cost 4 Krans- tnd 'Fastuni' trouserings at 15 Krans to 25/30 Krans for Gerian manufactu res. /manufactures. One leading dealer, who up to 2 years ago used to send 250 or 300 hales of ’Susi* (i.e. ’Pachizi'T Indian prints annually to Tehran, reports that Russian prints have entirely driven this line from the market, at least temporarily.' Bushire (June 1928) and the Persian Gulf generally. 'There is no sign of life in the market generally with the exception of a few sales in cars, lorries, spare parts and sundries for up country. Business is very bad. The Russian steamship service to the Persian Gulf was resumed during the month, the s.s. Tobolsk landing the following number of bales of piece goods: at Bandar Abbas 427; at Bushire 592; and at Mohammerah 500. h T o information is obtainable as yet regarding the nature of these Russian textiles. It seems that the Russians propose to send two boats to the Persian Gulf yearly. CQECLUSIQNS. Market extremely dull when not stagnant, purchasing power being at a very low ebb. Russian competition increasing not only in the ITorth- particularly in Tabriz, Tehran and~Hamadan- but in the South also. An outstanding feature, which is not brought out by the above reports, is the successful competition of Russian whites with British, often under imitative trade marks. This is very noticeable in Tehran. It is now two years since Russian prints captured the North Persian mazket. (signed) S.R. lingeman.1TH Draft Paper.

It appears that Russian cargoes Iminollp 11 € “^fh rSlan - G n f W u ^ dlstributed as far north as Yezd, for which purpose thpT?n • of -R have ^ €n °j ) i eiied in Shiraz and Ahwaz, as also a branch of the Russian Bank (“ Ruspers ”) in Shiraz. 3. The haim done to British trade in South Persia must necessarily depend on 1 tbe .P rlc ®’ P ual ^&gt; 7 aad quantity of the Russian products marketed, and that time om&gt; will show The disposal of these goods, at what one supposes to be less than S? st P™ 6 : a h ecfcs the Persian manufacturer as well as the British. One hears from i ezd that the local cloth factories have been forced to close down owing to the dumping of Russian cottons; from Shiraz, that the local shoe industry cannot face the competition of Russian manufactured shoes in Shiraz itself. These are merely examples picked at random. I have dwelt elsewhere on the disastrous disorganisa tion, frau g ht with numerous bankruptcies among the smaller Persian firms, which results from the trading methods of the Russian commercial agencies, and alluded o e advantages which the Soviets may find in courting unpopularity in this country while devoting attention to the saving of appearances. 4. Whether it is true or not that the losses incurred by the Russian trade o^amsations m South Persia are offset by the profits reaped in the north, one can hardly describe their gross undertakings as a commercial success, especially if one considers the uses to which the Russian manufactures imported into Persia mi°-ht have been put m Russia itself. There is a statement attributed to Chicherin which [548 o—3], is sufficiently logical to sound authentic. It is to the effect that it is not in e interest of Soviet Russia to develop its trade with Persia, the latter being an agricultural country needing industrial goods which Russia, itself in the throes ot a perpetual goods famine, cannot afford to part with. The fact that there e ® n developments in Russia’s Persian trade, in spite of everything, seems to indicate that disagreement exists among the Soviet Governments economists, or possibly between the politicians on the one side and the economists on the other, with regard to the commercial policy to be adopted towards Persia. The same must hold g9°^ for the other oriental States bordering on Russia whose imports are mainly mdusti lajp (Copies of this despatch have been sent to the Foreign Office, the Government Ox India and His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Iraq.)

Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extract from Shiraz Trade Report for the Year ending March 20, 1928. EARLY in 1928 the Soviet trade organisations, actively backed by the Soviet consul-general, began an attack on this market, in which Russian goods and merchants had never previously had any footing. From the beginning this was clearly a political manoeuvre, and profit or loss was a minor consideration. It began by the bringing down by road, all the 800 miles from the Caspian, of stocks of petrol and kerosene, and the cutting of prices of Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s products, which have only 300 miles to come from the refineries. It went on bringing large stocks of Russian prints from North Persia, taking orders at prices which even the coarse Indian “ gamti ' manufactures could not touch, and then, by direct sales of the Soviet Sharq ” organisation, underselling these clients, the cumulative result being3 an almost complete paralysis of all sales in those lines of cottons, in which Russian competition entered. Samples of Russian loaf sugar were also brought from Isfahan (on which transport costs from the coast at Bunder Pahlavi must have amounted to more than 75 per cent, of the current price of Marseilles'in the bazaar); and enquiries were made of certain Persian merchants whether they would contract to act as agents for the sale of 3,000 tons of sugar proposed to be imported via the Persian Gulf, followed by rumours sedulously disseminated that Russian ships were about to dump very large quantities at the Gulf ports, all this provoking consternation among ^dealers in Marseilles, Belgian and Java sugars, upsetting prices and deterring them irom the usual amount of orders for future supply. Considerable losses in money have been attributed to these business methods. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract from Kerman Trade Report for the Year ending March 20, 1928. RUSSIA has made an increased effort this year to capture the oil market, but their competition in petrol is negligible, whilst in kerosene oil they have only imported one-fifth of the quantity imported by the A.P.O.C. In piece goods, on the other hand, the Russians have made considerable strides (200,000 krans worth; about one-fifth of the total quantity of piece goods imported). They sell prints of good quality and design at a price with which Manchester cannot compete, and they have swept the market in prints and other cheap lines. Manchester cannot, apparently, hope to recover this market as long as the Soviet Government can maintain their present financial system.AQ?P British Legation, OPY/24417/1927.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch ITo. 72 of 26th July last, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch received from His Majesty's Consul General in Hhorasan (No.26 of July 14, 1928) which raises various points of interest. 3. As will be seen, the Soviets are practicing economy in Khurasan by withdrawing their trade organizations, which latter might indeed be accounted superfluous in a province where the Russian monopoly of sales and purchases is to all intents and purposes absolute. This economy in North Hast Persia may be designed to contribute towards the cost of the special effort now being made by the Russians in the region of the Persian Gulf. o. The newly established Perso-Russian syndicate for the purchase of cotton and wool,in Khurasan is probably modelled on 'Share’', fifty per cent of the shares of which are reported to be held by Muin Ut Tujjar Bushiri, probably the wealthiest merchant in Persia. In its first year, 1925-26, 'Sharq' paid a dividend of just over 100£; in its second year 24$. The results for 1927-28 have not been published hitherto but one hears that Bushiri has quarrelled violently with his Russian partners whom he accuses of 'cooking' the Accounts in order to cheat him of his fair share of the profits. This may account for the signal failure of the Russians to increase the capital of 'Sharq' by one million His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade.£-3- tomans three months ago when they offered a thousand 1000 fomans shares to the Persian investor. 50-6': ,000 Tomans only are said to have been subscribed. The Russians naturally find, every advantage in the participation of Persian capital in their commercial operations in this country: apart from the grist which additional capital brings to their mill, Persian financial cooperation carries with it Persian cooperation in preventing exportation to other countries than Pussia, and consequently in regulating the price of those Persian products which Russia may stand in need of. 4. The particular Russian demand for Persian cotton and wool was mentioned with reference to the Pi ini Pair. It appears from lolonel Biscoe's despatch that in order to obtain these raw materials the Russians are willing to make larger cash payments than the 10^ laid down in the Trade Agreement which at present governs the commercial exchanges between the two countri es. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (sgd ) S. R. hinge man Acting Commercial Secretary.ATP. COPY. 24417/1927. Enclosure in Tehran despatch ITo.

Jith reference to my despatch Ho. 16, dated the 11th of May 1928, regarding the Bussian Trade organisations in Xhorasan, I have the honour to report that these institutions have now all been closed and I understand that orders have been issued to the Customs that in future no Russian organisation or subject should be permitted to exnort goods to Russia. • xhere Q.iQ t however, two commodities which the Russians iHusl. purchase in this province, namely, cotton and wool, and I have received information that in order to facilitate their purchase, Miey have formed a syndicate with head quarters at Ashabad. This organisation tahes the form of a liiiiited company and 30 shares of 700 tomans each have been allotted to some of the more pro-Russian Persian merchants in Meshed, one ohird go Jadid mercnants and the remainder to Mohamedan merchants. These share-holders will in future co-operate in the purchase of cotton and wool for export to Russia, and the former manager of the Russian cotton department now works in ^he Russian Bank and spenas his time in assisting the Meshed share-holders and giving them instructions for controlling the cotton and wool market of Xhorasan. 3.Whenever these products are required by the principals at Askabad, one or two of the merchants here are instructed to buy/■buy at given rates and forward them to Askabad, the Russian Bank here advancing the necessary money. further, if any merchants wish to sell wool or cotton to the Russians on their own account, the goods are handed over to the Bureau x^erse in Meshed and against their receipt the Russian Bank then makes advances to the extent of 50 per cent, of the value and guarantees the exchange of commodities through the Bureau Perse. On arrival of the Russian imported goods in Meshed, the merchant takes up his loan, on which only 6 per cent interest is charged, and takes delivery of the goods. 4. At the present time more business is being done in cotton than in wool, but the anxiety of the Russians to purchase wool can be gauged from the fact that while against cotton imported to Russia they give a cash payment of 20 per cent, of the consignment, against wool they give a cash ' payment of 40 per cent. 5. I am informed that the price of wool in Baku at the present time has risen to about 330 tomans per Xharvar, and in consequence as much 174 tomans a kharvar has been paid here, a price with which ordinary purchasers, such as Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Go. and the Oriental Oarpet Manufacturers Ltd., are quite unable to compete. 3o far, however, the wool has not been exported to Baku and merchants seem to be somewhat dubious whether the prices there will be maintained. 6. lihirther, the clip of this year has been unusually bad and I hear from many sources that the quality is most inferior; dead and live wool is mixed and there is also a very large admixture of dirt. It would seem that through this syndicate the Russians hope to circumvent the embargo which has been placed upon their export, and at the sametime to prevent these eommodities being exported to Europe, for as soon as they ceased buying and prices fell, many merchants at once began to consider the possibility of exporting wool to England. I have not yet been able to ascertain the names of the share-holaers in this syndicate but I am informed that the larger merchants have kept aloof and continue to traue on their own account and that most of the shares have been allotted to the smaller fry.

The report to the D.O.T. on P.4599 together with the papers enclosed with it is of some interest as showing the energy with which Russian efforts to establish themselves in Southern Persia and in the Gulf are being pressed. It is possible that, as suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the D.O.T. report the Soviet may over-reach themselves in the same way ns they did on the occasion of the cruise of the Tomp at Jeddah by so conflicting with local interests as to render their mission a failure. But the definite renewal of Russian activity is a factor of some importance which cannot bet be overlooked in connection with the forthcoming deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. The danger which it presents has been emphasised by the Political Resident in a report to the Government of India on the points to be considered by the Committee which is being submitted separately. d/k^H.

I have no evidence that the 'Tobolsk' put in at any Persian Oulf port other than the three mentioned above. 2. The attached extracts from Shiraz and Kerman Annual Trade Reports emphasize the energy with which the Russian campaign of trade penetration has been conducted in South Persia during 1927-8. Whether the Russians are satisfied with the results hitherto obtained is best known to themselves. By shipping their goods to the Gulf they should be qble to effect an appreciable reduction in costs of transportation to the southern centres of consumption and consequently to intensify their campaign still further should they so desire.

The harm done to British trade in South Persia must necessarily depend on the price t quality and quantity of the Russian products marketed, and that time only will show. The disposal of these goods, at what one supposes to be less than cost price, affects the Persian manufacturer as well as the British.

Lord Cushendun observes that Eis Majesty*s Eesident in the Persian Gulf has instructed the Political Agent at Muscat to take no action in international matters without previous reference to the Besidency, and that these instructions v/ere apparently provoked by the supply of coal to the 'Tobolsk' by the Political Agent.at Muscat. 3. It is not altogether clear from the letter referred to above what action Sir L. Hav/orth proposes to take in future in regard to possible coaling by Soviet ships at Muscat or at other ports in the Persian Gulf. Nor does it appear from the Besident's telegram whether the coal supplied to the 'Tobolsk' at Muscat came from British Government stocks, and whether, if this was so, any other coal stocks are generally available in the port. 4. I am accordingly to suggest that, if Lord Birkenhead concurs. Sir L. Haworth should be requested to report what action, if any, he contemplates taking in any future similar cases and what the exact situation is as regards coaling facilities.

The Admiralty explained that refusal of coaling facilities was not in practice authorised as a rule, unless a state of war existed or was imminent. restrictions imposed by Colonel Haworth on the freedom of action of the Political Agent were not quite clear, that if they felt that the matter was one which should be taken farther, it would be best that they • should write in officially about it, the Admiralty being possibly the proper Department to initiate action.

April on P. 2564, it would appear that there has been no regular service by sea between Odessa and the Persian Gulf ports since the beginning of the War. In 1924, the Consul at Jeddah reported that a Soviet vessel, stated to be bound from Odessa for Shanghai and Vladivostok, had put in there, while in 1927 the Soviet steamer Tomp visited Jeddah in connection with the unsuccessful Soviet commercial mission to the Hejaz. In connection with this latter incident there were rumours that the Soviet contemplated the establishment of a regular ^ed: Sea _ service| and this was confirmed by the Russian wireless of 22nd February on P. 1378, which stated that a/a project for a regular service between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf via the Red Sea ports was in contemplation, and by the announcement in the Russian wireless of 14th April that direct intercourse between Odessa and the Gulf would be re-established at the beginning of May. Sir Thomas Se^grave reported on the 7th May to the Colonial Office (P. 2670) that the service in question would probably start in the autumn, and it was intended that its vessels should call at Bandar Abbas, Mohammerah and basraTrr^butrjTrom P. it wiIT be seen that the pilgrim ship from Odessa which left Jeddah for Hodeida on the 1st June is understood to be proceeding thence via Aden to the Gull, carrying one Naum Belkim, who is said to be proceeding to Shiraz on a commercial mission. that the crews of Russian vessels are prohibited from landing in Ggypt on account of the industrial unrest to which their visits tend to give rise, it has now been decided, after consultation between the Foreign Office and the Colonial Office, that the High Commissioner for Iraq shall be instructed to advise tne Iraqi Government to apply to Russian ships visiting Basrah regulations similar to those in force in Ggypt. The Foreign Office have also agreedfthat the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein may be advised by His Majesty's Government in the sane sense should the proposed service be extended to include whose ports. Nothing, of course, can be done at Bandar Abbas or ohammerah.

In these circumstances the secretary of State concurs in Mr. Amory’s proposal that the High Com Isa loner for Iraq should be instructed to advise the Iraqi Government to apply to Russian ships visiting Basra regulations similar to those in force in Sgypt. He further sees no objection to the sheikhs of Kuwait and Bahrein being advised by His Majesty's Government in the same sense, should the proposed service be extended to inolude these ports. 3. It appears from Sir R. Clive's despatch Ho.Overseas Trade (B) 46 of the 20th April, a copy of which is enclosed hersin, that the proposed Russian service to tn© Persian Gulf was to be initiated at the beginning of last month. 4.

Dear Sir John, I have just heard that the Russians intend running a Steamship Service from the Black Sea to Persian Gulf Ports and Basra. The service is ostensibly for the carriage of Russian Sugar and other produce for which they nay find a market in Persia and Iraq, but in addition to 'trade , the Russian Service will no doubt be used for spreading propaganda hence my reason for placing the matter before you. I ^ight mention that the Russians through their representative Mr.Melkofski, who is now in London, have asked Messrs Frank G. Strick k Co. Ltd. whether they will be prepared to act as Agents for the new service in Persian Ports and at Basra. We know from experience that a visit of a Russian vessel to an Indian Port is generally followed by a period of industrial unrest, strikes etc and I am informed by our Manager is at present home on leave from Port 3aid that the crews of Russian Vessels are prohibited from landing in Egypt. I understand that the service is to start in the Autumn and it is intended that the vessel s should call at Bunder Abbas, Mfhammerah and Basra. Yours etc, (Sd) T.Gr. Segrave. SIR JOHN E.

Tehran, March 9, 1928. Enclosure in No. 1. Intelligence Summary No. 5 for the Period ending March 3, 1928. (Secret.) A zerbaijan. 1. Frontier Disturbances. —The Kurds of Kiralar raided some Persian villages during the first week of February and carried off sheep and fodder. The Persians say that these raiders were Turks dressed up as Kurds, an idea which contains the germs of further friction between Turkey and Persia on the frontier. Tehran. 2. Review of Troops. —On the 25th'February the Shah held a review of troops outside Tehran. All arms participated. 3. Speech by the Shah. —The seventh anniversary of the coup d’Etat was celebrated by a banquet at the military school on the 22nd February. After dinner the Shah made a speech, in which he expressed himself well satisfied with the progress made by the army during the past year. They had carried out difficult tasks creditably. Various individuals had allowed themselves to be led into error (Pouladin, &amp;c.—see paragraph 8 of Summary No. 4); but they had met with due punishment. He (the Shah) had no use for any but those who carried out their duties with fidelity and sincerity; he judged all on their merits; he supported all those who fearlessly carried out their public duties and gave them full and entire independence in their task of consolidating public security and establishing order. He would have everyone know that those who abused his support in the exercise of their public functions would not only lose that support, but would receive the punishment they merited. 4. Rumoured attempt on the Shah. —An unconfirmed but strong rumour says that a soldier attempted to shoot at the Shah whilst the latter was inspecting troops working outside the city some days ago. The soldier is said to have been seen by an officer and instantly put to death ! 5. Communications. —The Shah has ordered that all road construction at present in hand has to be speeded up and finished as soon as possible, especially in the west and south-west. 6. Postal Services. —The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs has invited tenders for the establishment of a motor postal service between Tehran, Meshed and Duzdap. 7. Wireless. —A commission sitting at the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs has decided to spend 80,000 tomans on the purchase of the most modern short-wave wireless apparatus and 40,000 tomans on the establishment at Tehran of a radio station specially intended to work with Kabul. 8. Appointment. —It is announced that M. A. M. Tamarin has been appointed Soviet commercial representative in Persia. [408 cc—3]2 Kurdistan. 9. Unrest. —It is said that reports from West Persia and Kurdistan are unfavourable and that all news from these areas is being kept secret. 10. Frontier.—It is stated that Abdullah Khan Tahmaspeh has received special instructions for action in Kurdistan and that vigorous measures will e a en ere to put an end to the continual Kurdish raiding and interference. Luristan. 11. Alleged British instigation of the Lurs. —Apropos of the trouble in Luristan, it is openly said that the British supply the Lurs (and also the Kurt s) wi arms and ammunition. Gidf Ports. 12. Persians in Iraq. —According to the Tehran press, several Persian sheikhs of tribes in the Shatt-el-Arab area have telegraphed to the Shah to say that the Iraq Government has brought pressure to bear on them with the object of making tnem adopt Iraqi nationality, and is oppressing those who refuse. They ask that measures be taken to stop this, or else that the Iraq Government be asked to buy their property so that they themselves may return to Persia. 13. Bahrein. —The subject of Bahrein still looms largely in the Persian press, which lately left historical arguments for articles purporting to show that British “ ru le ” in Bahrein is accompanied by oppression and malpractice. One article goes so far as to accuse the British agent of torturing a man to death and states that cases of exile, deportation and confiscation of property of persons found guilty without trial are common. . . . n 14. Soviet Commerce. —It is announced that the Soviet commercial fleet is working out a project for the establishment of a regular service between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf ports, with intermediate calls at Arabian ports on the Red Sea.
