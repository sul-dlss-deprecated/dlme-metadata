This reconnaissance party will only undertake such work as they may be advised they can safely do until more definite arrangements have been made for their protection—presumably only for the portion of the route from Mohammerah up to Dizful—but as the conditions of the option practically give only one cold weather— 1913-14—for the completion of the survey it is necessary that a reconnaissance shall, as far as possible, be made beforehand for the purpose of deciding on the best route in order that the main survey party may begin their work without loss of time immediately after the close of the next hot weather. We shall be obliged is you will advise His Majesty’s resident in the Persian Gulf that the party will arrive at Mohammerah on about the 10th April, and ask him to kindly give them every assistance in his power, and also, if possible, to allow the British officer referred to in your letter of the 20th January to accompany the party.

(April 4, 12 - 30 p.m.) IN answer to communication of syndicate referred to in your telegram No. 149 ff*7 . , Minister for Foreign Affairs returned formal protest against the substitute a more conciliatory one, accepting the surveyors as making a reconnaissance and expressing a hope that, one or two of the engineers could come here in May with a view to seeing if arrangements could be made without further survey. To this, syndicate has replied that engineers will not be able to spare time to come to Tehran, and the Persian Government should send an engineer to Mohammerah at once. The Persian Government contend that they only agreed under the option letter to meet expenses of a preliminary survey, and that if they are expected to pay for work the surveyors to Mohammerah, that they are left in complete ignorance of approximate cost of proposed reconnaissance, and do not even know if this is intended to be the preliminary survey which they undertook to carry out in co-operation with the syndicate. They have no engineer whom they can send to Mohammerah immediately, and , they assert that heat in the south will make surveying operations there impossible until September or later. Their secret hope has always been that it might be found possible to come to terms with technical men here without making a survey. sending of surveying party without reference to Tehran, and refused to recognise it or be responsible for its safety. I induced his Excellency to take letter back and to to be undertaken by syndicate’s engineers it would at least have been courtesy on the part of the syndicate to have entered into communication with them before sending [554—115] ’A 11 APR 1913 SECR;.. ; ,, .y . 15[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA.

WITH reference to your telegram No. 225 of the 14th of this month, I have the honour to state that I took the occasion of a conversation which I had with M. Sazanof yesterday to inform him that it was now too late to reopen the discussion with the Persian Government of the allocation of the cost of the survey of the Mohammerah- Khoremahad Railway. As his Excellency still contended that this charge ought to be borne by the syndicate and not by the Persian Government, I pointed out that, as the former had only obtained an option for the line and not a concession like Russia in the case of the Julfa—Tabriz Railway, they could hardly be expected to incur such expenditure before the terms of the contract or concession had been settled. I further reminded him that we had shown our consideration for the financial difficulties of the Persian Government by forgoing the repayment of our last advance, whereas the Russian Government had recouped themselves out of the surplus of the northern customs. M. Sazonof replied that they had had a perfect right to do so, and that it was owing to the measures which they had taken tor the maintenance of order that there was any surplus at all in the northern customs. Eventually, however, his Excellency consented to allow the question to drop. I notice that Mr. Lynch, in his letter to the Persian Railwuy Syndicate of the 26th February, actually makes it a subject of complaint that the Russian concession for the construction of the Julfa—Tabriz Railway contains no stipulation for a guarantee from the Persian Government. Mr. Lynch states that it is common knowledge that there must be some guarantee, and he argues that it will therefore have to come from the Russian Government; which amounts, he says, to treating Persia as though it were Russian territory. You will recollect that M. Sazonof explained to me, as reported in my despatch No. 69 of the 2nd instant, that there was no occasion for a guarantee of any kind in the case of the line in question, for the simple reason that the railway would be very inexpensive to build, and that there was every prospect of the under- taking proving highly remunerative. I have no reason to doubt the correctness of ] M. Sazonof s explanations, and Mr. Lynch’s apprehensions would therefore seem to rest on no better foundation than his inveterate anti-Russian bias.

I [March 13.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 9. [11713] No. 1. Mr. Greenway to Foreign Office.—(Received March 13.) Winchester House, Old Broad, Street, Sir, London, March 11, 1913. I BEG to enclose copy of a telegram which I have received from Mr. Wood in reply to mine of the 5th instant. As you will see, the Persian Government are attempting to disavow the negotiations earned on with them by Mr. Preece in 1910, culminating in his letter of the 13th October, 1910. This letter defines the only conditions which had been stipulated for by the Persian Government apart from those contained in the draft concession which w^as originally presented by Mr. Preece. It had been agreed that the concession should be granted on these terms, and it was only the sudden collapse of the Cabinet that prevented the final completion of the contract. The draft concession now before the Persian Government is the same as the one originally presented by Mr. Preece, with the exception of the slight alterations relative to railways recently introduced, and their refusal to accept this is unreasonable and totally at variance with the understanding on which the option for the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Bailway was accepted by us. From a letter which has come to hand from Mr. Wood to-day it would appear that the Persian Government are repudiating the negotiations conducted by Mr. Preece on the ground that Vakil-il-lioyah was not an authorised representative of the Government, but this contention is quite untenable. When Mr. Preece arrived in Tehran he was requested by His Majesty’s Acting Minister—Mr. Marling—to see Vakil-il-Boyah and to deal with him as the accredited representative of the Persian Government, both in this matter and in the matter of the settlement of the question of the rent payable by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in respect of certain oil springs, his action in which latter matter was accepted by the Persian Government. Moreover, Vakil-il-Boyah was at the same time conducting with the Imperial Bank officials (with whom Mr. Preece was co-operating in the above matters) all the negotiations connected with the Imperial Bank loan of 1,250,000Z., with the Mint contract, and with the Strick oxide concession, and his actions in all these affairs were duly confirmed and accepted by the Persian Government. I attach a copy of my reply to Mr. Wood’s telegram, and I shall be much obliged if His Majesty’s Government can see their way to supporting this by indicating to the Persian Government that their action in this matter is most unsatisfactory, and that inasmuch as it has been a stipulation from the first that our assistance in railway construction was conditional upon the granting of the mining concession, their refusal to grant ttys concession on the terms previously agreed, and the introduction by them of a number of new and quite impracticable conditions, is a breach of faith on their part which cannot be permitted. As pointed out to Mr. Wood in my telegram of the 5th instant, the draft concession previously agreed to by the Persian Government is practically in the same terms as the D’Arcy oil concession, which has never, I believe, been questioned or considered as in any way unfavourable to Persia, and consequently there is no justification whatever for bringing forward these new proposals if the Persian Government have any serious desire to fulfil their obligations to us.

WITH reference to your despatch No. 93 of the 26th of last month, I have the honour to state that in the course of a conversation which I had with the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday, I enquired how r the Russian Government proposed to raise the capital necessary for the construction of the Julfa-Tabriz Railway, and whether there would be anything in the shape of a Government guarantee. His Excellency replied that the railw ay would be a very cheap one to build, as for a considerable distance all that it would be necessary to do w r ould be to lay the rails on the existing road. It was, moreover, certain to prove a paying concern. A Government guarantee would therefore not be necessary, as it would be quite easy to raise the money from private sources. While his Excellency explicitly stated that there was to be no guarantee, he gave no indication as to the sources whence the money w 7 as to be procured : and I did not think it advisable to press him further on the subject.

I have already said, in answer to enquiries of various Ministers, that I believe Russian Government attach great importance to the granting of this concession, which should present certain advantages to Persia in that it should serve to develop trade interests of district concerned. I gather that it will meet with very considerable opposition. Ministers argue that it cannot have a great value until the railway is made, and that its nego tiation can very well be postponed until the Medjliss reassembles. I have no reason to believe that there is any active Russian opposition here to British schemes beyond that I think it is known that Russia has made friendly [?] remonstrances in London concerning both Mohammerah Railway and the mining concession. Such action on their part is calculated to help rather than to hinder us, because Persian suspicion of Russia is very deep-rooted. Occasion might be used to make further representations about the needless hoisting of lights at Russian consulate-general at Bushire, about which I am in receipt of [group undecypherable] telegrams from British consul-general, who considers moment favourable for reopening question consequent upon change of the Russian consular authority following the suicide of the author of the idea of hoisting lamps.

WITH reference to my interview of the 25th instant with Sir Louis Mallet, I yesterday saw the Honourable Cecil Baring and Lord Errington with regard to the proposal that the Persian Railway Syndicate and the Societe d’Etude should in some way co-operate in respect of the proposed railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. We fully discussed the position of the various Persian railway schemes and 1 placed before them the following proposal:— 1. That they shall admit the Persian Railway Syndicate to a two-fifths participation in the five-ninths share which it is proposed that the British group shall hold in the southern section of the proposed trans-Persian railway. 2. That in consideration of this the Persian Railway Syndicate shall transfer to the Societe d’Etude their interest in the railway from Bunder Abbas to Shiraz. 3. That as a further consideration, and also in order to secure a more complete consolidation of interests between the British group of the Societe d’Etude and ourselves, we should admit Messrs. Baring Brothers and their British associates to a one-third interest in the Persian Railway Syndicate by increasing the capital of the latter to 45,000/. of which they would be allowed to subscribe one-third. I also explained to them the position and objects of the Persian Mining Syndicate and the connection between this syndicate and the Railway Syndicate, and offered to admit them to a one-third share in the former should they desire to take any participa tion in it. I pointed out to them that the proposals made by me in regard to the amalgamation of our respective railway interests would give them an equal interest in the proposed purely British railways (viz., Mohammerah to Khoremabad and Bunder Abbas to Kerman) to that which they now hold in the trans-Persian Syndicate, and, therefore that the arrangement was an advantageous one from all points of view, inasmuch as it would permit of the construction of railways in Southern Persia being proceeded with in the order of their importance and remunerative possibilities, without regard to the predominance of any particular British interests in any one line. They seemed to consider the proposals that I placed before them very'reasonable, and said that after consulting with their British colleagues they would let me know their views. I have, &amp;c. 0.

WITH reference to the passage in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 81 of 23rd instant, respecting the Mohammeralv Khoremabad Railway concession to the effect that the redundant argument was “ seen through ” at once by the Persia*!! Government, I think it. desirable to explain to you the reasons which prompted the last sentence of my telegram No. 80 of the 17th ultimo. There was no intention whatever of tricking the Persian Government into accepting a wording unfavourable to them. My object was merely to bring home the fact that there was no necessity for the Persian Government to insist at this early stage on the insertion of a particular sentence which was absolutely inacceptable to the syndicate and therefore rendered the option valueless. The sentence in question was obviously “ redundant ” from the point ol view of the Persian Government since they had amply safeguarded themselves by the preceding words “ on conditions to he arranged hereafter, which reserves to them freedom to make their own terms in the light of the survey. It was equally obviously objectionable; from the point of view of the syndicate since in certain contingencies it bound them, before the results of the survey were known, to an unfavourable settlement to themselves.

I AM obliged for your letter of the 14th instant, giving details of the terms of the concession for the Jidfa-Tabriz Railway, and advising that Sir Walter Townley is forwarding a copy of the concession by post. \\ ith reference to the point that neither the Persian Government nor the Russian Government are giving any financial guarantees, I beg to suggest the desirability of obtaining from the Russian Government some definite statement as to how the capital is to be provided—if not by guarantee. It is well known that even for railways in Russia the capital is almost invariably obtained by means of Government guarantees and that the money is largely raised in other countries. It would be still more difficult, if not impossible, for the concession- naire of the Julfa-Tabriz Railway to raise the capital required for a railway situated in Persia without such a guarantee, either from the Russian or the Persian Government. Therefore it is to be assumed that the capital is to be provided in some way by the Russian Government, similarly to the capital which is being employed in the Russian Banque de Perse, the whole of which, it is generally understood, has been supplied by the Russian Government, and this assumption seems to be supported by the statements which have been made as to the intention to build the Julfa-Tabriz Railway as a “ Russian State line.” If the capital is to be so provided it is very essential that the fact should be known, as it will place Russia in the position of being able to begin the construction of their northern railway forthwith, whereas if the construction of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad railway is to be dependent upon a Persian Government guarantee it may be years before it can be taken in hand.

It would be too late to reopen the question with the Persian Government as to the allocation of cost of survey. There has been some criticism here already because Russia has obtained a contract for her railway while our syndicate has only obtained an option. We are vyell aware of the critical state of Persian finances, and we have shown our appreciation of their difficulties by forgoing the repayment of our last advance, while, according to our information, the Russian Government recouped them selves for their advances in 1912 out of the sadly needed surplus of the Northern customs, thus rendering their financial aid of dubious value.

I cannot conceive that any Medjliss would accept such a position, and, o± course, the Persian Cabinet under the Constitution are not empowered to deal with the railway question at all, powers for this purpose being specially reserved to the Medjliss, as our chairman has already pointed out in his letter to the Foreign Office. In the absence of the Medjliss, the political situation in Persia is wholly irregular ; but the building of Russian railways in Persian territory with the forced concurrence of the Persian Cabinet, is such a serious step that I am extremely sorry to see that it is passing without protest by the Government. 1 still hope that such protest will be made, and that steps will be taken to render it effective. The issue of Persian State bonds for the construction of railways is a vastly different matter from the Bagdad Railway terms, against which our Foreign Office has protested in the past. That was the principle accepted by Mr. Shuster, whom nobody would accuse of neglecting the interests of Persia, and it ought to govern the construction both of the railway in the north and of that in the south. I can see no reason why the Persian Government should not be invited to settle that question at once. Preparations could then be made for issues of Persian State bonds to meet the expenses of the survey and construction of the lines decided upon. Under these circumstances I trust that our chairman may be able to persuade the Foreign Office at least to make it clear to the Persian Government that the terms now offered are accepted on the understanding that the conditions upon which railways are to be constructed in Persia shall receive their early consideration. I cannot see why we should have to wait two years for a decision on this point. Having this in mind, I should recommend the deletion of the words “ in order to arrive at a decision in the matter and to draw up the necessary conditions, a preliminary survey is necessary.” These words seem to me to be quite unnecessary. I should also leave out the words four lines on, “ after the completion of the survey,” and make it read, “ on condition that if the Persian Government should decide.” Yours sincerely, H. F. B.

This alteration does not appear in either of the two accompanying documents, but it has been duly notified to the Persian Government. • r In the Persian counter-proposals, the Minister for Foreign Affairs informs Mr. Mood, the representative of the syndicate, that the Cabinet consider that the revised project appears to offer the most practicable and equitable arrange ment possible, both for Persia and for the concessionnaire, due regard being had to the laws and usages in force in Persia as regards mining questions. Vossough-ud-Dowleh adds^ that the Cabinet in elaborating this text have borne in mind the necessity for Iraming an arrangement which will subsequently meet with the approval of the Medjhss, before which body the Government will have to answer for their acts.

The limits of the area to be handed over to the syndicate have not been defined in the draft counter-proposals, because the Cabinet desire to examine still further into the matter, but I think that there is good reason to believe that the area sought by the syndicate will be granted. The objection entertained to lines drawn from one point to another is that such an arbitrary line may give rise to disputes as to whether a mine is inside or outside the boundary, whereas no mistakes could be made if provinces or well-known administrative districts were specially designated* It is much to be hoped that the syndicate will examine the Persian proposals carefully and dispassionately, because I am convinced that the Government are sincerely anxious to grant the concession, and that it will be infinitely easier to secure it now than it will be at some later date, when it will have to be submitted to a Medjliss or possibly be dealt with by a less well-disposed Cabinet. It will, doubtless, be possible to obtain some modifications should the syndicate put forward sound aro-uments in support of their wishes. ^ I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. But, so far as I can ascertain, after consultation with the Persian Minister and Messrs. Stanford, there is no modern map clearly showing the limits of the provinces; Lord Curzon’s map even is not clear.

How much or how little of what passed at these negotiations he communicated to other persons connected with the Government neither we nor our representative in Tehran were aware, nor was it our business to enquire since Mr. Shuster, under article 2 of the law of the 12th June, 1911, held full authority to act for the Persian Government subject only to approval of the Medjliss. crJ r ‘ ^ ^own, w .k° was our representative at the time in Tehran, explains that Mr. Shuster recognised no authority whatever on the part of the Cabinet, which was at the time an effete and ineffective body, possessing no administrative powers at all m connection with the matters which, under the law of the 12 th June, 1911, had been transferred to the authority of the treasurer-general. Mr. Shustei s attitude in this respect was shown in Mr. Brown’s telegram of the 16th October, 1911, of which a copy was furnished to you in due course, in which the latter wired as follows :— • ^ to co ^ rece ptio n by Cabinet and strong objection, leader of Parliament against Khoremabad treasurer-general will not submit contract to Parliament, but will ask Parliament to authorise him to make contracts for construction of line from Julfa to Mohammerah on the basis of terms and conditions arranged with us.” £bis shows that ( 1 ) there had been some discussions between the Cabinet and Mr. Shustei on the subject of our contract, but that, as the Cabinet were not favourably disposed towards it, he intended disregarding them altogether (the objection of the Cabinet at the time was that the termination of the line at Ivhoremabad was tantamount to a lecognition by the 1 ersians of the British and Russian spheres of influence'), and ( 2 ) that the terms and conditions of the contract had then been agreed between the I ersian Government (in the person of Mr. Shuster) and ourselves, subject onlv to ratification by the Medjliss. As regards the subsequent telegram from Sir Walter Townley, our agent (Mr. Brown) thinks it desirable that some attention should be drawn to the incorrect distinction which is drawn between Mr. Shuster and the Persian Government in the first sentence of your letter dealing with this telegram and in the penultimate paragraph of your letter, because the statements in question imply that in negotiating with the^ treasurer-general he was dealing with an unauthorised person and not with the Persian Government. With reference to the variations between the annotated copy of the draft contract referred to by Sir \V alter Townley and the draft submitted to the Persian Government last summer, Mr. Brown states that they agree with the following exceptions:— 1. Alterations agreed to in telegram of the 3rd October, 1911, to Mr. D. Brown in reply to his telegram of the 30th September. Copies of both telegrams are enclosed. The reason for not altering the draft contract in accordance with the telegram of the 3rd October was due to the fact that Mr. Shuster approved both proposals, leaving 1 [2804 x — 2 ] - - ‘ f &gt; &amp;2 it optional to the syndicate to insert whichever clause they favoured. These alterations appear in articles 13 and 15 of the printed draft. Copy of telegram dated the 16th October, 1911, from Mr. D. Brown, showing that the terms had been accepted, is also enclosed. * ' 2. Article 4, which refers to the free grant of land, has also been altered for reasons known to the Foreign Office. 3. Clauses 22 to 25 of Seligman contract relating to American treasurer-general and his staff, which were embodied in draft contract, have been eliminated from printed contract because they are not now applicable. Mr. Brown explains that his negotiations with Mr. Shuster were all only transacted verbally, and that as he held the proper authority of the Persian Government, vide articles 23 and 24 of the fundamental laws of the constitution of the 30th December, 1906, and of article 2 (c) of the law of the 12th June, 1911 (copies of all of which are enclosed), he considers that he was in fact negotiating with the Persian Government, and that they were and still are bound by the treasurer-general’s actions.

Consider all other terms practically agreed. (4.) C°py of Telegram sent to Mr. D. Brown, Tehran, October 3, 1911. Referring to your telegram the 30th, syndicate cannot possibly entertain no remuneration during construction, nor is it reasonable for Persian Government to assume that they can contract on largely more favourable terms than Russia, Turkey, Argentine, Brazil, Chile, &amp;c. Last word is syndicate will agree to accept 2J per cent, to be included in contractors’ profits, making 12 J per cent, in all, or alternatively 15,0001. per annum during construction, in either case syndicate taking bonds 871. 10s. and retaining profit on bond issue, if any, and receiving 15 per cent, net receipts, with minimum of 15,000L per annum from date line opened. Clause 22 highly desirable include British Government, but if treasurer-general find this quite impossible we agree to citizen United States, only some provision is necessary for other loans if any bearing pro rata proportion of salary.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of the French text of the Julfa- Tabriz Railway Concession, which was signed at Tehran on Thursday, the 6 th instant, by Vossough-ed-Dowleh, Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the part of the Persian Government, and by M. Podgoorsky, on the part of the Russian syndicate to whom the concession has been granted. The duration of the concession is for seventy-five years from the date of the completion of the construction, with an option in favour of the Persian Government to purchase the same after thirty five years; and the work must be carried out within eight years from the commencement of the work of construction, which must be begun within two years of the date of the signature of the concession. There is no financial guarantee either on the part of the Persian or of the Russian Government attached to the concession. The Persian Government and the share holders will divide in equal parts all profits from the undertaking after 7 per cent per annum has been paid upon the capital invested. There are no preferential rights l attached to the transport of Russian goods. The concession carries with it the right to construct a branch line from some point on the Julfa-Tabriz line to a place on the north eastern shore of Lake Urmia, but no navigation rights on that lake are secured. The concession also carries with it n preference for the construction at some future date, on conditions to be determined upon in due course, of a railway from Tabriz to Kazvin, on equal terms with the conditions put forward by any other company or syndicate. The right of constructing a carriage road from Tabriz to Kazvin is also renewed to the same company, the old road concession having lapsed, and upon the conditions of the said concession, on the understanding that the work of construction of the said road shall have been commenced within two years and concluded within eight years from the date of the present instrument. The large mining rights over an area of 40 miles on each side of the line form part of the conditions of the old road concession. The Persian Government has succeeded in modifying the old conditions in the sense that 15 per cent, of the net profits of the working of the petroleum and coal mines in this area has to be paid to the Government, whereas under the original conditions of the road concession it received no share whatever. A clause granting the company the right to fell timber on Government lands within the same area has been cancelled. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1.

I Tin VP SfO ’ GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. Enclosure 1 in No. 1 . Aide-memoire communicated to M Sazonof. SIR EDWARD GREY has received a communication from Count Benckendorff protesting against the conditions of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway concession, and urging that its conditions should approximate to those of the Julfa-Tabriz concession, and asking that an exchange of views should take place between His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government. His Majesty’s Ambassador has the honour to inform the Imperial Minister for Foreign Affairs that Sir E. Grey cordially welcomes this proposal, and that he would therefore be glad to know the conditions of the Russian concession, more especially in regard to arrangements for securing equality of freight rates. With regard to the Mohammerah-Khoremabad concession, Sir E. Grey is replying to Count Benckendorff on various points of detail raised in his Excellency’s communi cation, and he recognises at this stage the Persian Government should not be tied down to more onerous financial clauses than those of the Russian concession. Sir E. Grey is in the meantime authorising His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to accept an option from the Persian Government for the Mohammerah line on condition that, pending a settlement of the terms of the concession or contract, the syndicate shall not be involved in any financial outlay on the survey, and that the Persian Govern ment will afford at their expense adequate protection for the engineers engaged in survey. His Majesty’s Ambassador is instructed to suggest to M. Sazonof that a similar course should be adopted in regard to the Russian concession from Julfa to Tabriz, so that the British and Russian Governments may act in complete harmony in the matter at Tehran. His Majesty’s Ambassador has the honour to add that His Majesty’s Government are now making proposals to the Societe d’fitudes which will hasten the operations of that syndicate, and that he expects to receive at an early date detailed instructions which will enable him to enter into definite negotiations with M. Sazonof on the subject. St. Petersburgh, Januairy 23 (February 5), 1913. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. A ide-memoire communicated to Sir G. Buchanan. (Translation.)

The conditions on which the agreement relating to this matter has been reached between ‘ the Persian Grovernment and the Julfa-Iabriz and Fnzeli—J ehran Roads Company are doubtless known in detail to the British Legation at Tehran. Ihe Imperial Government are not yet in possession of the final text of the concession, but from the telegram from M.

Grey to inform you that a telegram has been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran giving details of the concession for the Julfa-Tabriz Railway. According to Sir W. Townley’s report, the concession is for seventy-five years, the Persian Government to have the option of purchase after thirty-five years. Neither the Persian Government nor the Russian Government give any financial guarantee, and construction is at the risk of the concessionnaire; the concession is a conversion of the old road concession, carrying with it the right to work all petroleum and coal mines on either side of the line to a distance of 40 miles ; profits derived from the working of the railway are to be divided equally between the shareholders and the Persian Government, after 7 per cent, has been paid on the capital invested; 15 per cent, of the net profits derived from the working of the mines found on the State lands within the above-mentioned radius on either side of the line is to go to the Persian Government. No preferential tariff routes in favour of trade are conferred by the concession ; it includes the right to build an extension to a spot at the northern end of Lake Urmia ; and it grants preference to the company to construct a railway from Tabriz to Kazvin on equal terms with those that any other syndicate or company may propose, and the lapsed road concession is renewed under certain conditions dealing with the period of construction. v Sir W.

REFERRING to my conversation with Mr. Parker, I beg to give below particulars of a conversation which I had yesterday with M. Goukassof, a director ot the Socie e d’Etucles, whom I happened to meet that afternoon : 1. M. Goukassof began by remarking that his group* had secured the concession for the Julfa-Tabriz Railway, and presumed that we had also secured our concession. 1 expressed surprise at his being interested in the Julfa-Tabriz concession as had understood that he was only concerned jn railways in I ersia as a member ol the Societe d’Etudes, whereupon he explained that he was associated with M. Podgurski m 2 I suggested to him that it would be desirable to join up the Julia-lahriz Railway with the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, in order that a through connection might be made from the Caspian to the Gulf, and indicated that if this was practicable our syndicate might be prepared to co-operate with them. . . , , He replied that such a line would not be at all m Russian interests, as it would give much greater facilities to British trade than to Russian, and went on to explain that it was not their intention to carry on the line from Tabriz to Urmia, but that then next objective after Tabriz was Kazvin, and eventually Tehran. . w , 3 I then asked him how the capital lor his railway was to be obtained. He sa that this point had not yet been settled, but that the line was to be built as a Russian State Railway,” and that if the capital is not guaranteed by Persia it would either be guaranteed by Russia or be provided for out of Russian State funds. . , , His replies on this point were somewhat vague, and gave me the impiession tha the exact method of raising the capital had not yet been settled, but that, if a guarantee from Persia were not asked for, it was the intention that the capital toi the pulw J would be provided by the Russian Government as an advance to 1 ersia, possibly n anticipation of some future loan. . .-i , T i ,, v, having a further bearing on the above matter, I may mention that I leatned a short time ago from Lord Grimthorpe that it was a syndicate t m which he, Messrs Morton Griffiths and Co., and an American named Mr. Williams [sic], winch was some time ago endeavouring to obtain the concession tor the Julfa-Tabriz Railway through the Russian Government, and that after carrying on their negotiations for some time Mr Williams, who was conducting the negotiations m St. Petersburgh, was lnfo ™ e ^ b v M Kokovtsof, the Finance Minister, that he need not trouble any more about this concession, as the Government had decided to build this railway as a State line, and therefore that no financial group would be allowed to secure the concession.

Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 1913. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant on the subject of the Trans-Persian Railway project. Sir E. Grey fully recognises that the project, in its present form, somewhat differs from the lines upon which it was originally drawn up, but he thinks that, on further consideration, it will be evident that the modifications are of a nature favourable to the “societe.” The commercial advantages of through connection between Europe and India are far from being indisputable, and it is obvious that the alignment now proposed is likely to render the scheme a more profitable investment than a more direct route. I am now to refer seriatim to the points enumerated in your letter:— (a.) You submit that, “ having stipulated for Government control, and insisted on an alignment suited to political requirements,” His Majesty’s Government should not at the same time exclude the possibility of financial assistance in the future. I am to point out that the expression “ Government control ” in this reference does not appear to be altogether borne out by the terms of my letter of the 4th February, whereas the alteration of the alignment to one “ suited to political requirements ” conveys an inadequate idea of what has in effect been suggested, since the alteration in question would result in the line being diverted from an arid desert to a region which is relatively populous, and therefore more suited for railway enterprise. Such being the case, Sir E. Grey fails to appreciate why the circumstances to which you allude should render a British Government guarantee more necessary; indeed, he is rather led to the opposite conclusion. ( 6 .)—(2.) In regard to this point, Sir E. Grey would recall to you the following sentence in my letter of the 23rd November :— “ While Sir E. Grey cannot but regard the question as somewhat premature, he recognises that, if railways are built in regions adjacent to those traversed by the line you have in view, then means should be found for securing through traffic, destined to pass on to, or coming from, your system, against unfair manipulation on railways outside your direct control.” I am to add that the desire of His Majesty’s Government is to promote co-opera tion amongst British commercial interests in Persia. You will, however, recognise that the time and conditions of the Kerman-Bunder Abbas line are matters which are not devoid of all political bearing. (3.) His Majesty’s Government have no objection to furnishing to you a list of persons forming the Persian Railways Syndicate. They are submitting that list to the secretary of the syndicate for revision, and it is hoped that it may be communicated to you very shortly. The lines in which the syndicate are interested are the following :— (a.) From Mohammerah to Khoremabad. ( 6 .) From Bunder Abbas to Kerman. (c.) From Bushire, via Aliabad, to some point on a line. (d.) From Bunder Abbas, via Shiraz, to Ahwaz. Sir E. Grey recognises that the line under {d) now coincides to some extent with the suggested main line of the Trans-Persian Railway, but he thinks that it will be possible to come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Persian Railways Syndicate in respect of this portion of the line. The last paragraph of your letter has been replied to in a separate communication of to-day’s date. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4 th instant. • rj- group welcome the clear statement therein contained of the opinions oi His Majesty’s Government on certain points submitted for their consideration on the 9th December last. At the same time it is evident to them that if the views now expressed are maintained the lines of the original project for an international trans- Fersian railway will have been so materially altered that none of the advantages anticipated from the through connection with India can now be reckoned upon^in support of the scheme. ^ Such departure from the original idea of direct rail communication between India and Europe will necessarily require full discussion with their French and Russian associates in the Societe d’Etudes. Before even this step is taken it would seem imperative to ascertain the extent to which British railway interests in Southern Persia are capable of consolidation, as it is only after settlement of this question that an international agreement can satisfactorily be reached. I he extent and nature of participation which, with the consent of the British Government, should be offered to foreign interests over the main trunk line (running from the Russo-Persian frontier to Bunder Abbas via Shiraz) can then be determined. Dealing separately with the points of your letter under reply, I venture to advance the following considerations :— As to (a), the British group note the clearly expressed assent of His Majesty’s Government to the principle of a trans-Persian railway project, but they desire to emphasise the fact that the conditions now imposed by the British Government are tantamount to converting the original Indo-European project into one mainly intended for the development of railway enterprise in Southern Persia. In these circumstances they would submit that, having stipulated for Government control, and insisted on an alignment suited to political requirements, His Majesty’s Government should not at the same time exclude the possibility of financial assistance in the future. In regard to (b), the British group are glad to learn that their co-operation in the Societe d Etudes is still considered desirable on general grounds. They note that His Majesty’s Government hold themselves already engaged to support other interests in the following concessions :— 1 . Mohammerah-Khoremabad. 2 . Bunder Abbas-Kerman. 3. “ Certain lines in the neutral sphere.” With regard to (2), the British group are naturally much concerned to find that His Majesty’s Government consider themselves committed in such a way as might render an important section of territory—one, moreover, vital to any trans-continental scheme—tributary to competing interests. As to (3), these last-mentioned lines remain unspecified, and until the British group have learnt what they are, and been satisfied that they do not interfere with the completion of the main alignment now suggested for adoption, they cannot usefully enter into discussion with other parties, British or foreign. With legald to the statement that His Majesty s Government would be prepared to recommend to the parties interested in the projects in the neutral sphere that it would serve British interests if they would join with the British group of the Societe d’Etudes,” the British group would be glad to know who are the parties interested in the projects referred to by the Foreign Office. [2804 £—1]Information on this head would enable the British group to appreciate the value to be attached to any expression of views which the parties in question may desire to put forward. In conclusion, the British group note that the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment is accorded to the text of the proposed letter to the Persian Government, subject to the modification of wording suggested in your letter under reply, which, on resuming communications with their French and Russian associates, they will submit for their consideration. The absence of any further mention of the texts of-the proposed inter-group agreement (enclosed in my letter of the 20 th December, 1912), and of the proposed declaration desired by the French group (enclosed in my letter of the 15th ultimo), leads the British group to assume that these documents also have the approval of the Foreign Office.

I have lost no opportunity of impressing upon the Persian Government the great importance attached by His Majesty’s Government to granting of the mining concession. I have just urged this again on Minister for Foreign Affairs, who renewed assurances previously given to me on various occasions that Persian Government is most anxious to meet the views of the syndicate. He argued that it would be fair to examine Persian proposals before condemning them, as they are framed on Russian Karodagh concession, but are more favourable to British syndicate. His Fxcellency added that he could not accept the contention that concession had been virtu altyagreed upon by Preece and Persian Government. The language used by Sir G. Barclay in his despatches No. 232 of 19th December, 1910, and No. 52 of 14th April, 1911, would appear to support his argument. Draft proposal and Persian Government’s counter.proposal went to you by post on 16th February.

Sir Edward Grey to Count Benckendorff. SIR E. GREY presents his compliments to the Russian Ambassador, and has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of his Excellency’s communication of the 25th ultimo, respecting the mining concession which is the subject of negotiation between the Persian Government and a British syndicate. The negotiations in question have been intermittently carried on for some years, and Sir E. Grey understands from a recent telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Russian Minister has long been cognisant of the proposed boundaries of the concession. As long ago as 1910 it had been arranged by Sir G. Barclay and a representative of the syndicate at Tehran that the concession should not encroach on the Russian sphere. It appears, however, that some confusion has recently arisen at Tehran with regard to the limits of the concession, and the syndicate, in deference to representations from His Majesty’s Government, have agreed to the northern boundary of the concession being further modified so as to run in a straight line from Abadeh to ^Neh, instead of from Yezdikhast to Birjand. The effect of this change will be apparent from the accompanying map, where the proposed limits are indicated in violet ink. His Majesty’s Government trust that this explanation will be fully satisfactory to the Russian Government. They welcome an exchange of views with the Russian Government on the subject, as they are most desirous of complete and frank co-operation between the two Governments in regard to all Persian questions.

An annotated copy of a draft contract, which is presumed to be the instrument which Mr. Shuster is alleged to have approved,’ though there is nothing to prove this in the archives either of the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, or the Treasury, is the only record left of these negotiations. Moreover, there are many particulars, one of them a financial point of some importance, in which the draft contract mentioned above differs from that submitted to tbe Persian Government last summer. All the amendments are distinctly to the advantage of the syndicate, and some of them are of a nature which it is known would have been inacceptable to Mr. Shuster. The Persian Government have not been informed of the annotated draft contract. Sir E.

Please explain how in those circumstances, the Persian Government could be trapped into financial obligations. 1 the syndicate ask for at this stage is that the question of a guarantee should not be decided m a sense unfavourable to them before the survey is made.

Tehran, February 3, 1913. I HAD very important interview with Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday. As futther delay threatens (to) wreck negotiations, please reply immediately to my telegram of the 28th January stating your own opinions and wishes regarding proposal irrespective (of) Foreign Office opinion, and, if necessary, I will conclude the business without further reference to anyone. Owing to very severe Russian pressure, Persian Government cannot hold out for much longer, and if they are compelled to grant Russian concession first, your interests will be very seriously prejudiced, if not wrecked. Enclosure 2 in No. 1 . Copy of Telegram received from Tehran by Mr. Greenway, February 3, 1913. MY telegram of to-day applies equally to your mining, and I have undoubted proof(s) of Russian intrigue against both. Strongly advise you to'act as suggested, and leave political difference to be settled after the event. Persian Government still hope that you will increase loan to 200 , 000 L How much can you add ? Enclosure 3 in No. 1 . Copy of Telegram received from Tehran by Mr. Greenway, January 3, 1913. PERSIAN Government desire to substitute province Kerman-Luristan in place of your boundary(ies) and grant railway and mining in principle, leaving detail to be arranged later as situation does not admit of delay. [2804 c—2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] I told Mr. Greenway that articles 2 and 4 in their present form would give rise to much difficulty : the claim in article 2 to the exclusive right to build tramways, &amp;c., in the whole area of the concession would undoubtedly be regarded as a monopoly, was therefore agreed that a possible way of meeting the difficulty would be for the syndicate to have the right of establishing necessary transport facilities, “in so far as they do not exist or are not adequately and duly provided by the Persian Government or their nominees.” This merely gives the syndicate a reversionary right essential to the protection of their interests. Article 2 has been amended accordingly and article 4 has been cancelled. I told Mr. Greenway that the Russian Government were somewhat perturbed by tbe limits of the concession. Mr. Greenway said those limits did not encroach on the j Russian sphere, but he was willing to admit Russian participation in the concession j up to 50 per cent, of the whole should the Russian Government desire it and His j Majesty’s Government agree to it. As to the limits of the proposed concession, it had been arranged that they should be from Yesdikhast to Birjand, avoiding the Russian sphere, and from those two points due south to the coast. Now Mr. Wood, Mr. Greenway’s agent at Tehran, has telegraphed saying that the Persian Government desire to alter these limits to the provinces of Kerman and Luristan (the latter, he thinks, must be meant for Laristan). Mr. Greenway would like to give the Persian Government the option of adhering to the limits as described in the preceding paragraph, or of making them the province of Kerman including Seistan (where there is a mine) and Pars, including Laristan. He pointed out that if Russia were admitted to this concession it would confer on her an interest in the British sphere, and he there- j fore suggested that any Russian interest in the concession might be confined to such portions of it as were outside the British sphere. Mr. Greenway said that any of the solutions covered by this minute would be acceptable to him, and that he would instruct Mr. Wood to be guided by the advice of Sir W. Townley as to the course he was to adopt. I told Mr Green way that full and detailed instructions would be telegraphed to Sir W . Townley in accordance with w hat- ever course Sir E. Grey might decide upon, and that we would duly advise the Mining Syndicate in London. 1 gave Mr. Greenway a copy of this minute, which he said accurately represented his views. . ^ [A] PERSIA [February 3.] CONFIDENTIAL.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 11, 6 p.m.) (No. 65.) YOUR telegram No. 69 Tehran, February 11, 1913. (February 11, 7 p.m.) Julfa-Tabriz concession is for seventy-five years with option of purchase by the Persian Government after thirty-five years. There is no financial guarantee attached either on the part of Persian Government or Russian Government, and concessionnaire constructs at his own risk of loss. The concession is a conversion of the old road concession, which carries with it the right to work all coal and petroleum mines within a radius of 40 miles on each side of the line. The Persian Government participate in profits which may be derived from the working of the railway in equal shares with the shareholders after 7 per cent, has been paid on the capital invested. The Persian Government is to receive 15 per cent, of the net profits derived from the working of the mines found on the State lands within above-mentioned radius on each side of the railway. The concession confers no right to established preferential rates in favour of trade, but it does include the right to build extension to a place at the northern end of the Lake Urmia. Preference is also granted to company to construct railway from Tabriz to Kazvin on equal terms with those that may in future be proposed by any other syndicate or company, and the road concession, which had lapsed, is renewed under certain conditions as to the period of construction.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—([Received February 9, 11 p.m.) Tehran, February 9, 1913. (No. 59.) / (February 9, 9 p.m.) MY immediately preceding telegram I very much regret that the language I employed in my telegram No. 55 would appear to have conveyed an erroneous impression of attitude of Persian Government in the matter of Khoremabad Railway. Minister for Foreign Affairs repeatedly pressed me betbre the signature of Russian concession as to whether I had received an answer to his proposals, as he expressed earnest desire that the British option should be granted first. Members of present Cabinet are fully alive to all that they owe to support of His Majesty’s Government, and have shown themselves throughout later negotiations most anxious to find a formula which would be acceptable to His Majesty’s Government and to syndicate, whilst assuring the early commencement of a work which they are desirous of seeing completed with as little delay as possible. Neither Persian Government nor Mr. Wood are in possession of particulars furnished to Shuster. Negotiations appear to have been conducted between late treasurer-general and Brown without being submitted to Persian Government. Neither Shuster nor Brown left any records beyond an annotated copy of a draft contract which is presumably instrument which Shuster is said to have approved. There is likewise no written record of any such approval here, either at the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, or the Treasury. Moreover, draft contract above alluded to differs in many particulars, one of them a financial one of no small importance, from the draft contract submitted to Persian Government last summer. All the alterations made are decidedly in favour of syndicate, and some of them are such as it is known Shuster would not have accepted. This annotated draft contract has not been brought to knowledge of Persian Government.[282—204] CONFIDENTIAL. r Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 9, 11 p.m.) Tehran.

In latter case syndicate shall build at its own expense and responsibility.^ In order to be in a position to choose one of the two above-mentioned methods and to draw up the necessary conditions a preliminary survey is necessary. Persian Government agree to commence this survey now in co-operation with syndicate, expenses of survey to be defrayed by Persian Government, on condition that if, after Jae completion of survey, Persian Government, by virtue of their right to select one of the two above-mentioned methods of construction, should decide to grant a concession to syndicate, the same shall refund to Persian Government expenses incurred in survey. “Obviously Persian Government will provide at their own expense means for protection of engineers and surveyors. “ Period of this right of option is for two years from date of this letter.” In communicating to me a copy of above letter, “ chef de cabinet ” was instructed to express hope that syndicate would be good enough to submit at as early a date as may be convenient a draft concession in order that conditions of the two draft proposals may be taken into serious consideration at once with a view to no time being lost in making selection between the alternative methods of construction.282-206] ’CONFIDENTIAL.

Russian Government are not yet in possession of final text of concession, but Russian Minister has informed them by telegraph that imposition of tariffs on railway in question has been conceded to the Julfa-Tabriz and Enzeli-Tehran roads company, with following reservation :— “ Concessionnaire does not intend by means of tariffs to embarrass Persian exports, and such wares, under equality of conditions, shall not pay different tariffs. ” Memorandum says nothing as to whether imports may be subjected to differential treatment. /v U 10FEB1S13 \CONFIDENTIAL.

It is a source of great surprise and regret to His Majesty’s Government that the Persian Government have not accepted the very moderate proposals made by the syndicate for an option only, while the Russian concession has already been granted. In view of the great forbearance exercised by His Majesty’s Government, this inequality of treatment is most regrettable and will give rise to much adverse comment, and there must be no further delay on the part of the Persian Government in granting the option desired by the syndicate, and you should insist on their doing so. Details in regard to contract or concession can be settled as soon as option is granted. The syndicate are equally anxious to settle the terms of the contract or concession, and I feel sure there will be no delay on their part.

He thinks that they will be accepted, but objects that by so doing matter of the railway will have made no progress, as the Government cannot agree to conditions of a contract without being in possession of certain details which the syndicate declare themselves unable to supply, presumably until after survey has been made. Persian Government are most anxious that work on the railway should be commenced as soon as possible, and he will probably suggest that cost of survey should be borne by Persia on similar conditions to those he proposed when suggesting that syndicate should make a survey within two years. His Excellency added that he cannot understand why the syndicate now withholds information as to the estimated cost of construction, &amp;c., which apparently they supplied to Mr. Shuster. My Russian colleague says that, as far as he knows, Russian Government are anxious that the Persian Government should not be committed to large expenditure, which would entail pledging of certain securities that may be required for the loan.

It was further urged that the present Ministers are not mere office-seekers, desirous of enriching themselves, such as some of their predecessors have been, but that they are men who have entered the Cabinet from patriotic motives, and are not of the sort that can put up with the daily importunities of mendicant pensioners and unruly soldiers merely to cling to office. If, after the concessions are granted, Russian Government could be persuaded to advance the 200 , 000 L originally contemplated, now that the previous advances have been repaid, and His Majesty’s Government did the same with a separate advance for the gendarmerie in the south, Persian Government would be in a position to set to work seriously, more especially if they obtain further 100 , 000 h on granting of mining concessions, which is to be discussed by the Cabinet on 29th January, and is promised favourable consideration.

I replied that the Russian Government would not be giving them a fair chance if they refused to join us in an advance, and I expressed earnest hope that, after the loyal support which you have given him throughout the Balkan crisis, he would co-operate with you in supplying the Persian Government with sum they asked for. He said that though he could not promise 250,000L he would use all the arguments he could to induce the Minister of Finance to make a substantial advance as soon as the two railway concessions were granted. As regards these concessions his Excellency said that the fact that His Majesty s Government were asking the Persian Government to give certain guarantees with regard to British railway, while the Russian Government were asking for some for theirs, was calculated to delay the granting of the latter, and the two concessions might therefore have to be treated separately. On my speaking of a separate British advance for the gendarmerie to protect the trade routes m the south, he said that we were at liberty to advance whatever sums we liked for this purpose, and that we might do so at once without waiting for the granting of the railway concessions. 15L -531]CONFIDENTIAL. *■ r -.i Sir TF.

We certainly do not propose to make any separate advance ourselves for general purposes, but desire to join with Russia in advancing for general purposes a sum not exceeding in all 250,000£. from each of us respectively on conclusion of railway concessions. We are, however, confronted with necessity of re-establishing order on trade routes in the south. Attacks on British officials and the murder of a British officer give us ample justification for doing this by dispatch of a British force, but we much prefer, as an alternative, to advance money to enable a Persian governor to restore order by improving gendarmerie or allocating some force to protection of trade routes. Any advance that we made separately for this purpose, or any share of the joint advance that we made in excess of the share advanced at any moment by Russia would be given solely for this purpose, and under conditions that would enable its expendi ture to be controlled by us and limited to this purpose.CONFIDENTIAL.

Urey to inform you that a telegram has been received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to the effect that want of money may force the Persian Government to sign the railway concessions any-day, but that in the present political uncertainty it is very hard to get anyone to take decided action. With regard to the concession for the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, Sir W. Townley expresses the opinion that there are too many queries attaching to the contract, and no answers forthcoming, for it to be probable to get it signed as it stands ; and that it seems hopeless to expect to conclude negotiations without a negotiator who is competent to discuss details. Sir W Townley suggests that the best course under the circumstances would be to secure a written engagement that your syndicate shall be allowed to construct the railway, leaving the conditions for later negotiation. He adds that the Persian Government object, with some reason, that, as they are to take the risk of financial loss, they must be in a position to understand the details more fully. Sir E. Grey concurs in Sir W. Townley’s suggestion, and has authorised him by telegraph to address the Persian Government in that sense. I am, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET.

AS I informed you in my letter of the 17th instant, the text of clause 4 of your contract Avith the Persian Grovernment, as submitted by you in your letter of the 12 th instant, was telegraphed to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, for communication to Mr. Wood, provided Sir W. Townley saw no objection to it. I am now directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to inform you that a telegram has been received from Sir W. Fownley suggesting the deletion of the clause providing for the appointment of the British Minister at Tehran as arbitrator in the disputes between your syndicate and the Persian Government, or the substitution of some formula leaving the choice of an arbitrator open to the negotiators. Sir W. lownley s objections to this clause are based on the same considerations as those which led Sir G. Barclay to take exception to it last year, viz., that it might place His Majesty s Minister in an invidious position if he had to act both as advocate and judge in such disputes. Sir G. Barclay suggested that a solution of this difficulty might be found in referring those differences which cannot be settled by negotiation, to some foreign representative at Tehran whom the two parties could select by mutual agreement. Sir E. Grey would accordingly be glad to hear from you which of these two alternative suggestions—leaving the choice of an arbitrator open to the negotiators, or referring matters in dispute to a foreign representative at Tehran to be agreed upon by the two parties—would meet with the approval of the Persian Railways Syndicate.

These views have been placed before the syndicate, and it has been decided to act upon Sir Edward Grey’s advice in the matter, particularly in view of the fact that the Societe d’Etudes are net now, we understand, sending out their delegates this month, as was originally intended. I note that Sir Edward Grey, though he recognises the syndicate’s claim to promote further developments in railway construction, considers it expedient, for the reasons stated, to concentrate our attention in the first place on securing the concession for the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line, and I have accordingly wired to Mr. Wood as follows :— “You can meantime accept contract for Mohammerah-Khoremabad, only reserving other lines for subsequent contract.” [2729 r — 4] -t[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] 0 PERSIA.

IN reply to your letter of the 9th December, we are instructed to advise you that our board have considered the proposed draft of article 4 enclosed in your letter, which, however, does not quite cover the points desired by the board as the clause states that the syndicate are only to be granted the right of acquiring lands and buildings other than Government property with the consent of proprietors. These last words are extremely inadvisable as the intention of the clause, as drafted by us, is to prevent the unreasonable withholding of the consent of any individual or individuals, the result of which might be to render the construction of the railway impossible. Some words giving the syndicate powers equivalent to those conferred by the Land Acquisition Act in India are, our board consider, essential, and they have therefore redrafted the clause as per copy enclosed, the alterations being shown in large type. We trust that the clause, as now submitted, will meet with your approval, in which case, our board will be greatly obliged by your telegraphing same verbatim to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran immediately. We are, &amp;c. (For British and Foreign General Securities and Investment Trust, Limited), A. B. STODART, Secretary. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of Article 4. THE Imperial Persian Government makes a free grant to the syndicate of all the uncultivated lands belonging to the State which the syndicate’s engineers shall deem necessary tor the construction of all or a part of the works in question, and the syndicate shall be authorised to take on such lands and [or] any other lands belonging to the State free of cost, the timber materials, &amp;c., which may be required for the construction or maintenance of such works. As for the cultivated lands belonging to the Government, the syndicate must buy them at an equitable price and one which is the current market price in the province. The Imperial Government grants also to the syndicate the right of acquiring from other proprietors all other lands or buildings necessary for the same object, on conditions to be settled between the syndicate and the proprietors, on the understanding that the latter shall not be able to raise any claims of such a nature as to enhance the ordinary current prices for lands situated in their respective districts. In the event of any difference between the syndicate and the Government or other proprietors as to the price agreed for the purchase of any zones or strips of land as provided in this clause, it shall be referred by the syndicate and the Government or such other proprietors, jointly, to the decision of the British Minister at Tehran, who shall have power to decide whether any price proposed to be paid is reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances. Holy places and all their dependencies within a radius of 200 Persian archins are formally excluded from this clause, except in cases where the local ecclesiastical authorities otherwise expressly agree.

Mr. GREENWAY called on the 29th November and brought with him the draft of a telegram which he proposed, subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office, to send to Mr. Wood, his representative at Tehran, in reply to a telegram about the Kerman mining concession. The gist of Mr. Wood's telegram was that the Persian Government would agree to grant the mining concession in the Hritish sphere provided Mr. Greenway and his friends would agree to their original proposal of making a loan of 100,000h, or possibly more. Mr. Greenway, in his draft reply, proposed to agree to these terms ; but he had inserted a sentence to the effect that Mr. Wood should try to get included in the concession mining rights on the littoral and islands of the Persian Gulf. Mr. Greenway asked me if there was any objection to this sentence, which Mr. Strick, who was a member of Mr. Greenway’s syndicate, was anxious to get included. I said that I thought it would complicate matters considerably, and that I thought it would be far better to leave it out. I had in mind Mr. Ellingers interests, and I thought it might cause a good deal of trouble.

Memo., Oct. 14, ’08 [33780]. Minute on India Office, May 9, *10. To Sir G. Buchanan, No. 129, May 10, ’ll [15143]. 2 . With regard to the second question, on the .14th October, 1908, His Majesty's chargi d’affaires at St. Petersburgh handed to M. Isvolsky a memorandum in which he stated that His Majesty’s Government, besides the southern section of a line which mio-ht be constructed from Julfa to Mohammerah, would specify, as the concessions which mostly concerned them, the lines Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz, with the option to construct a port at Khor Musa. To this communication no reply appears to have been made by the Prussian Government. In May 1911 His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh was instructed to inform the Russian Government of the conditions on which His Majesty’s Government were willing to assent in principle to the proposed Trans-Persian Railway and to agree to the initiation ot negotiations between its promoters m St. 1 etersburgh and Lvindon, One of these conditions was that Russia should support the demands made by Great Britain on the Persian Government for the concession of the following lines . (a.) From Mohammerah to Khoremabad, with a branch to a port to be constructed at Khor Musa ; • (b.) From Bunder Abbas or Charbar via Regan and Bam to Kerman ; (c.) From Bushire via Aliabad to some point on a line (d.) From Bunder Abbas via Shiraz to Ahwaz. To Sir G. Buchanan, No. 134, May 16, ’ll [19356]. Mr.O’Beirne, No. 181, June 28, ’ll [25701]. To Sir G. Buchanan, No. 192, July 19, ’ll [25701]. It was proposed that the main-line and those of the above branches which lie m the neutral sphere, t.e., (a), (c),and (d), should be internationalised, but that the branch in the British sphere should be a purely British project. Sir G. Buchanan reported on the 16th May, 1911, that he had communicated to the Russian Government the conditions of His Majesty s Government in this connection. On the 28th June following, Mr. O’Beirne reported that he had been informed by M. Neratof that he had not intended to reply to Sir G. Buchanan’s communication, and that it would be time enough to go into the detailed questions raised by the conditions imposed by His Majesty’s Government when the ‘ Societe d Ltudes ^ had completed its task. When dealing with the conditions laid down by Great Britain, the Russian Government would probably put forwmrd conditions of their ovm, and this would involve lengthy negotiations. Sir G. Buchanan was told that it would not be necessary to press the Russian Government for a reply until the “ Societe d’Etudes ” had made their report. No more correspondence appears to have taken place on the subject to the end of 1911. G. de B.

Winchester House, Old Broad Street, wrrnrj , London, October 21, 1012. v 11 H reference to your letter of the 23rd July last, in which it is stated : — 1. I hat the Russian Minister at Tehran concurred with His Majesty’s Minister that the moment was opportune for pressing on the question of the Monammerah—Khoremabad Railway, and that such action might be of some assistance to M. Poklewsky in his efforts to secure the Tabriz-Urmia line, and 2 . I hut Sii Walter Townley had been requested to use every endeavour to obtain a promise of the concession, and to report what form of pressure would, in his opinion, be likely to prove effective, I am desired by the Persian Railways Syndicate to enquire as to what has been the result of Sir W alter Townley’s representations to the Persian Government. • j- TtlG s y n 4 lcate makes this enquiry because their advices from Tehran seem to indicate that instead of the Mohammerah-Khoremabad Railway being pressed on it has now been relegated to a secondary place, it apparently being intended to await the result of the Russian negotiations for the Tabriz-Urmia line before any further action in regard to the former be taken. In view' of the contents of your letter as above quoted, my syndicate cannot believe that this is the case, and would lie glad to know what is the present position of the negotiations. As indicated m my letter of the 2/th September to Mr. A. 0. Wood, copy of which I beg to hand you herewith, the Persian Government have before them the draft contract agreed with Mr. Shuster in his capacity of treasurer-general, and seeing that M. Poklewsky was anxious that our application should be pressed on, there appears to be no reason why this should not be signed at once without waiting for the conclusion of the Russian negotiations in respect of the Tabriz-Urmia line. I am, Sir, &amp;c. C. GREEN WAY. Enclosure in No. 1 . Persian Railways Syndicate to Imperial Bank of Persia (Tehran). Winchester House, Old Broad Street, Dear Sir, London, September 27, 1912. WE are in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, and regret to see that the matter of the concessions has again been shelved indefinitely. You will no doubt do your utmost to get it brought to the fore again at the earliest possible moment in accordance with the desire of the Foreign Office and ourselves, and the desirability of this is the greater inasmuch as Lord Revelstoke, who is at the head of the Trans-Persian Railway Syndicate, has been invited to Balmoral to join in the discussions between Sir Edward Grey and M. Sazonof, and will doubtless not miss this favourable opportunitv for trying to obtain prior consideration of the Trans-Persian proposals. As you know, the Trans-Persian Syndicate has been told all along by the Foreign Office that the Mohammerah-Khoremabad and/or Burujird-Hamadan lines must take precedence of the Trans-Persian schemes. The syndicate have always accepted this position, admitting that the former scheme is entitled to this precedence, not only by virtue of the greater advantages of the line both to British and Persian interests, but also in respect of the earlier promis£S*ei-Sil£port given to it by the Foreign Office. [2662 s— 8 ] COP'f IS O IhRMA 13 DEC 1912 , SECRETARY'S NgS OjThis being the position, we must not allow it to be relegated to the background; and with reference to your remarks in your letter of the 4th instant to Sir Walter Townley that the Cabinet is not likely to take any notice of the contracts agreed with Mr. Shuster, we would like to point out that the position we maintain in regard to this^, contract is that it has been actually passed and accepted by the Persian Government in the person of Mr. Shuster, who had full powers to conclude the contract, and therefore that it is not open to further modification in any essential respects. As you are aware, the contract was finally passed and accepted by Mr. Shuster, and the only step that remained to be taken was its submission to the Medjliss, whose endorsement of Mr. Shuster’s action was necessary as a matter of form. Consequently the line to take now is, we think, merely to call upon the Cabinet to complete the contract, i.e., to perform the act, which, if Mr. Shuster had retained his post, would have been carried out last year by the Medjliss. If the different members of the Cabinet are allowed to intervene and suggest all sorts of new conditions in the hope of making “ mudokhil,” finality will be' never arrived at; and if you can get Sir Walter Townley to accept this view and support our application in this manner, there is no reason—if, as you say, the Russian Minister is not likely to raise any objection to our project going through—why our contract (which is an eminently favourable one to the Persian Government) should not be signed forthwith.
