No.S/41^-8/8, V To i \Ay*0 British Agency, Sharjah, 28th June 1940 * The Political Agent, Bahrain* Memorandum I beg to report that lately I received information that the Shaikh of Sharjah had been opening his wireless set on the German Arabic Broadcast so loudly that one could hear it from 200 yards from his Palace and that a large crowd gathers there to hear the German nev/s of which they took much interest* To satisfy myself I went round, in disguise , one night* The information I redeived was correct* Without being noticed X heard some of the people arguing with each others some on the side of Germany and others against them* On the morning of 24th I saw the Shaikh and reminded him of his action until lately, namely allowing no one to hear the German broadcatt outside his palace* The shaikh promised to lower the tune which he did but many people attend his Majlis and hear the news* After the latest events in France I heard that some people had been talking freely in the town about the mighty power of Germany and the collapse of France which would soon be followed by the complete crush of Britain* I did not believe that any one would venture to speak against the British Government unless he was backed up by some responsible person. Therefore X made very 'Up- careful and secret enquiries^as to who is really responsible for tfe this anti-British propaganda*The result of these eqnuries revealed that ‘Abdullah bin i*aris, the secretary of the ohaikh of Sharjah had been at the bottom of all these* In order to throw ash into my eyes ‘Abdullah bin Faris always praises the British government in my presence j^and also before pro-British and persons who are likely to convey the information to to me* He acts behind the cur fain by inducing ordinary people under his influence to spread rumours about the successes of the Germans and the defeat of the British vaoverament* He attends the Majlis of Shaikh Saif bin Muhammad al Madfe* ,Qadhi- 2 - &amp; of Sharjah(he is leaving for Riyadh via Bahrain for a visit to H.M.King Bin Sa^d which is usual for hiiu to do every year^ and there spread the rumours among ordinary and innocent persons who happendto be present^who 7 in turn repeat what they hear when they go out. ‘Abdullah bin Faris appears to be convinced that British Government are going to be defeated. I heard from reliable persons that he had been telling the Shaikh and members of the family that they will soon get rid of the British Government. During the few last three days they following sentences were chalked onffiwr walls in the town:- “Long live Hitler“ and “ Right is with Germany'. These have besn the subject of talks and speculation. The people are waiting to see what action would be taken against Sharjah in view of these activities, when the Shaikh called on me today,as usual, I reminded him of my talk with him few days ag^o, the activities of his Secretary and the writing on the walls. I told him that as a friend of the British Government his attitude had been very good towards H.M.G. and that I had no doubt that every thing which displeases the British Government would be displeasing to him. That I made thorough enquiries about the recent rumours and discovered that they were due to his Secretary whose hajait was to create trouble for the Shaikh always.-with his neighbours, the Government, his notables, brothers and ^ven the Shaikh*s family. As a Shaikh, I said, he should not hear his ill-advice or allow other mischief makers to misguide him. The Shaikh spoke very nicely about the friendship existing between him and the British Government and said that he prayed for the defeat of Germany and the success of the British Government the fact which he open&amp;£ declares in every Majlis. That he did not expect his Secretary to do anything against the British Government. That he would not allow visitors to attend his '^ajlis until after the German Arabic broadcast and would make enquiries about the writings on the walls and punsih the offenders if discovered even if they were his brother 1 thanked the Shaikh for his kind expression and said that I was reporting the matter to you. I do not think the Shaikh himself is in favour of the Germans or one who could n&amp;t be moulded so as— 3 ' to meet with the interests of the British Government* .Unfortunately the Shaikh lacks will and is nothing but a dull instrument in the hands of his Secretary and, therefore, no good could be expected from him as long as he acts under the influence of his Secretary* Although I bel&amp;ave that the Shaikh would comply with his promise about the braodcast I do not anticipate that he would take action against his Secretary or sincerely try to discover the writer on the walls. ‘Abdullah bin Paris* father was a Najdi but he is a subject of Sharjah* 2. I do not think that it would be advisable or good policy to let such ±&amp;l matters pass without being checked and immediate and deterrent action taken* 3* I could not think of any reason for his anti-British XsxKMwaxt attitude except the refusal to gaant him a visa from £&gt; a hrain/when he wanted to go to Kuwait and the message conveyed to the shaikh about him* I am strongly in favour of taking the most effective action against a mean person like Bin *aris who is taking mis- advantage of the world situation* I suggest that we should send a warning to the Shaikh to take action against his Secretary in a specified period, say two or three days, failing which we xkdHifitx would take so and so action against him* 4. Owing to the war I do not know what action would be possible. In my opinion we should avoid action which could be heard of outside and take such action which would effect the pocket of the Shaikh driectly such as the stoppage of his air facilities allowance or oil payment* As an Sternative t$ impose a fine which / if not recovered,from the Secretary by the Shaikh, to be taken from his allownce* 5* A British subject in uubai named firadas Dhamanmal, manager of the Firm of Dhamanmal isardas is reported to be anti- British. The latest information I received about him that he, in reply to question about the news, said to Salim bin liusabbih and Muhammad Abu Ruhaimah that the allies of the British Go ernment have been defeated and the British Government will soon be crushed by the Mighty Germany. This sort of remark on the Trucial Coastis highly objectionable especially from a British subject. X suggest that I be authorised to send him back to India by the first steamer after telling that his presence on the irucial Coast is undesirable on account of his talk in favour of the ■arm enemy of His Government. This will have very good effect on the local people and i strongly recommend we take prompt action so as to prevent repercussion on the Trucial Coast* I have not said anything to the Hindu until I receive orders from you&lt; Residenct Agent, bharj ah*Confidential No. C/546 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 1st July 1.-40.

Memorandum \ a c&amp;py of a memorandum No. S- I enclose herewith 419 dated 28th June 1940 feceived today from the Resi dency Agent, Sharjah. 2. I am inclined to agree with the Resid .ncy Agent that we should not overlook the disloyal action of the Shaikh of Sharjah^ Secretary, but it must be acknowledged that we are somewhat restricted at the moment in the action we can take. It may suffice to write zo the Shaikh, reminding him of the lett;&lt;r which we sent to him on the outbreak of war calling for his co-operation a 3 a.;.nst the ■ Hi -ig/6 enemy and of his reply (eopy^ was enclosed with my memo- randum No. C/563 'dated the 19th September 1939). We can point out that his Secretary has committed no minor misdemeanour and ask him to state at once what action he proposes to take to implement his promise that he will punish severely persons who fail to 'avoid all topics which the High British Government dislike'. This theme can be expanded a little in the hope of frightening or cajoling the Shaikh into effective action. 3. As for the man Tiradas Dhamanmal, I can probably arrange through his employer here for his departure from the Trucial Coast.

The Shaikh of Sharjah took no steps to enquire except that he reduced the tune, ^parently because the propaganda has been carried out by his own men and most probably with his approval. Recently 1 heard that one *Abdul *Aziz bin Saif al Madfa(the son of the Qadhi of Sharjah) composed, of his own accord, some poems praising the allies and condemning the Germans• I heard that when the Shaikh and his group heard it they were annoyed and the Shaikh himself(v/ho is a peet) composed some poems against the British Government and praising the Germans which he wrote in the name of his son Saqr. I did not believe the story* I was told by a reliable person that a copy signed by Saqr hims&amp;lf was sent to one of his relatives. I tried my best to get a copy of the poems and if possible the copy believed to have been signed by Saqr himself* After promising dis- that I would not show it to any one or/close his name or that of his relative he brought it to me and I took a copy of it. I, hov^ver, asked him to keep it with me for few days after which I will return it to him* As he has just brought to me I took a copy of it and enclose copies of the poems A and B made by 'Abdul 'Aziz and C te$iich is believed to be made by the Shaikh. C was composed to contradict A. 3. On the wall of 4he shop of a British subject named Dhamanmal Jagoomal of Sharjah the following words were written f Long live Germany, down with Britain* • These and others on the houses of British subjects were wiped out by them. 4 # It is clear evidence that the Shaikh and his men are taking misadvantage of their position and acting behind the1 v' 1 ) Translation of poem marked 11 A' in red pencil . \\ &lt;9 Truthful news comes from the Allies, and false and baseless ones from Berlin.

'iA Political Agent, Bahrain,- A Translation of letter dated 20th Jamad/II 1359 (25.7.40) from the Ruler of Sharjah, to the Political Agent, Bahrair. y After compliments, „ I have received your letter No. C/583-28/10 dated 15th July 1940 and noted its contents, especially about the information received by you from various sources that anti-British propaganda is being carried out in my state and that certain remarks were written on the walls. That some persons are trying to convince the people of Sharjah that Germany, may God forbid it, will^be_ victorious over Brita.in and that my servant Abdulla oin x^aris is chiefly responsible for this. Therefore I beg to inform you that I and all my people are the loyal friends of His Majesty's Government. As regards the writings on the v&lt;falls, this happened once or twice only and must have been done by an enemy of both of us, and I have been pained by it. We tried to find out the person who did it but I regret to say we were unable to trace him. I am indeed surprised by the accusation directed against Abdulla bin Paris as he is one of the most loyal supporters of His Majesty's Government and still continues to be their friend and the enemy of their enemies. The accusations directed against him have no basis of truth at all, and' whoever conveyed this information to you has reversed the facts. I forward herewith copy of a document bearing the signatures of notables and merchants of our town, including our subjects, your subjects and Iranians who testify that he is one of the greatest and most zealous propagandists for His■Majesty's Government and is the enemy of their enemies openly and at heart. Regarding the listening to Berlin broadcasts I beg ^to state that I no longer listen to it as it spreads falsehood. Under all circumstances in this war we are the enemies of Germany a.nd xtaly 'tails' (followers, in contempt) and Y/e have done nothing that would'change that friendship. I therefore request you to ask whoever has conveyed these lies to you to prove his allegations because I am indeed afraid that he will come forward with some 'more lies and bring us into misunderstandings with you. Hoy/ I v/ish he conveyed to you what he actually heard and seen of me ana of others! I beg to suggest to you to send secretly somebody whom you trust,v/ithput my knowledge and without the knowledge ox pour Agent, to see the truth for himself and to know the reason of these lies, then you will knoY/ who your loyal friend is, and who the one deserving of punishment is.

After the meeting the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah went to Dubai and from there went to Has al Khaimah on 25th. According to info mat io: which had leaked out through one of the Shaikh of Sharjah’s » brothers, the Shaikh of Sharjah warned his brothers not to say anything against ’Abdullah bin Paris whom he described as being most honest, faithful and very capable person whose loss would not be compensated and fofc that reason he would not take any action in the matter. At noon on 23rd ’Abdullah bin Paris, the Secretary of the Shaikh went to Shaikh Ghulam ’Abbas and Radha Masih, Iranian merchants and told them that as they were aware when the war was declared against Germany, the Shaikh issued a notice warning people against dealing with or speaking in favour of Sermany. That he had done good services to the British Government and expected to be compensated for it. He then took out a paper from his pocket at the head of v/hich an Arabic writing ✓ which according to information, purports that ’Abdullah bin Paris Secretary oi the Shaikh of Sharjah had been looking/and serving the interests of tks His Majesty the King of Great Brtadn.

That the certificate would substantiate the charge against him instead of clarifying his position and thus will de££at its ends. 4© Tiradas Dhamamnal. I do not think I can properly explain the good effect which the news about Tirdas had on the local and foreign communities on the Trucial Coast. No news or topics except in favour of the British Government are now being heard. Tiradas came to me and requested me to help him. He said that he was prepared to render an apology for what had passed and to give surety(even if 1 wanted the Shaikh of Sarjah) to behave well in the future. I told Tiradas that 1 was not prepared to help him in any manner which I believed was detrimental to the interests of the the Government ^ am serving. I added that if he had any thing uo say or request to make he should submit that to the Political ngent.

The letter had a very good effect on the Shaikh and his Secretary, ‘Abdullah bin Paris. The Shaikh is avoiding all talks and topics about the Germans and Italians, and is doing his best to show that he is the most loyal and sincere friend of the British Government. His Secretary, ’Abdullah bin Paris also refrained from pro-Nazi talks and, so far,is reported to be spreading only the good news about the British Government.

You mentioned that I know less of what goes on in my town than what you do. I am surprised at this - hearing is different from seeing. Regarding the retention of the services of my man ♦Abdullah bin Paris, if I did not consider him to be sincere and loyal I would not have employed him. His devotion to the British Government is known to me and the people and as I stated previously, know nothing to the contrary abput him. May I therefore request your excellency to accept my sincere excuse combined with my best compliments. I pray * God to grant you victory and success. Usual Endings. i —i—t?
