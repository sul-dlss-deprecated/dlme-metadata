Government of India. /7/I/1 SAVING, Bagdad 7. / . : * TmJY Your .telegram Noi 145 SAVING,of the 5th October [propaganda policy in Persia in relation tosconomic assistance] has been carefully considered with the departments concerned, who are in general sympathy with your views and have made every effort to meet your recommendations. 2. To take first the specific recommendations in your \ paragraph 6:-' v ‘ . *' &gt; (a) Increased Import Quotas . You will appreciate that the requirements of Middle Eastern countries must for some time to come continue to .be treated as a whole. It is for M.E.S.C. to judge the relative needs of the various territories, and we cannot contemplate special shipments to one or x&gt;)ther of the territories, which have not been correlated with M.E.S.C. s general import programme. It is h^ped in the near future to arrange a general increase in imports to the Middle Eastern area as a whole, from which Persia may expect to benefit in proportion to her needs, nut there can in present circumstances be no question of granting Persia preferential treatment* : . It must be borne in mind that it is exceedingly difficult to justify increased allotment of civil goods to Persia so long as the Persian Government remain inactive in purchasing goods already allotted under existing quotas (e.g, tea and cotton piece, goods from India) and in clearing from ports and distributing goods already in the country (your telegram No. 15 paragraphs 2 and 7). 'Until the Persians show that they can digest what they are. ; already getting they clearly cannot expect to be given more. (b) Machinery and Di e s els. : i Some types of machinery, and’Diesels in particular, are in very short supply and there is no prospect of the position easing# But some 500 tons of Diesel machinery tapproximately 140 slow speed Diesel engines) have been programmed for Persia and it should be possible to supply the bulk of these by December 1944. Diesel *r* ■ ■, ■ spares . r • Spare parts for Diesel Engines are in equally short supply, but every effort is being made to keep existing engines running.- Where these Diesel engines are of German manufacture the position is further aggravated by the lack of stocks of spares in the United Kingdom. Enquiries are still being pursued on the extent to which :suipable parts can be obtained or manufactured in the United Kingdom and every effort will be made to meet the requirements. You will, of course, appreciate that it may not be possible to manufacture special^types:of spares while United Kingdom productive capacity is fully geared to our om war effort, ^ % aC ayu*.*/ A-*’' } ^ — ,^ c e-&gt;/r st/brs-*f s s£, V, Wc SSu-xJ***-. /*s-+r y ft Y-■ r « % v * * 2 « (c) Develop ment of Trade va th India , . I quite -agree that this, is desirable, but the immediate requirement is surely that the Persians.; ^ more active in taking advantage of facilities already ofiered by the Government of India (see under (a)). . . . ’ As regards appointment of Indian Trade Commissioner, please see Government of India telegram No. 11322 to India Office, (d) Transport Aircraft . Air Ministry can allocate 3 D.0. 89 ! s to Persia during Uc-nnh ( src Air Ministrv Sign, months No. A s January, February, March 1944’(see Air Ministry Signal . 627 of 22nd November to your Air Attache;, (e) Capital Development . A British firm. Sir A, Gibb and Partners is interested in the Lar Valley Hydro-Electric and Irrigation scheme (see correspondence enclosed in my despatch No. 15; and other British firms have shown interest in a water supply scheme lor Tehran. Generally speaking it is unlikely that capital equipment in quantities necessary for any substantial projects will be available for a considerable time. But there is much preliminary survey work etc. cto be done in connexion with any such schemes, and our aim should be to keep the Persians in play until _ capital equipment becomes available. See also paragraphs o t -4 and. 5 below. ; (f) (i) Technical Help . I agree that provision of technicians is desirable. Ministry' of War Transport have written to M.E.S.C. inquiring what can be done. Supply of technicians from this country is of course extremely difficult at present. (ii) Train ing of Experts fo r Textile Industry, Railways : etc. '■ * : Your recommendations have been brought to the notice of the McCorquodale Committee'on which the Ministry of Labour.Foreign . Office. D.O.T.', British Council and Industrial Associations are represented. This committee is exploring the best way to encojurage British firms to accept foreign students and trainees. British Council have offered to put their organisation abroad and their welfare services' at home at the disposal of firms or other bodies for this purpose* 'And it may well be that when the committee have decided on suitable coordination machinery, Persian textile and railway engineers could be brought to this country in considerable numbers on the scholarships offered by firms rather than as British Council scholars. I will keep you inrormed of developments. (g) Cultural Activities, Your recommendations do not^entirely coinciae wTpTTnosI; submitted by Mr. Bingley to the British Council. Mr. Bingley r s proposals, adoption of^which in toto has been recommended by British Council comprise; . .

If he does he will no doubt make recommendations for sending technical pro-* . fessors and lecturers 'from the United Kingdom. (h) Medical Assistance . I agree as to the desirability of maintaining this and hope that Government of India and P.A.I.C. can continue to help. Please let me know if you also require any assistance from,here. (j) Persian Armed Forces. ' (i) We hope that procedure now agreed with United States authorities (see correspondence ending with War Cabinet Offices* telegram No. L.M.A.B. 110 of 2nd February to the J.S.M. Washington) will ensure that Persian Army requirements are met either from the United States sources or from P.A.I.C. I understand that the Persian Army has already received consider able quantities of motor transport and other material from United States sources. (ii) Rehabilitation of Persian Navy . This question was recently examined, and I fear that the position remains as described in No. 32 SAVING of 24th September, (iii) Persian Air Force. Training of pilots in the United Kingdom and the supply of Arsons has already been arranged. Air Ministry's other proposals should reach you shortly. 5. It is of course impossible to deal in any detail at the present stage with the prospects of post-war yrade with Persia, but the following general observations may be of some guidance to you. 4. (a) In the period following the armistice with Germany, British output will still be earmarEed on an extensive scale for service requirements. Relief demands will also be heavy for the goods Persia needs - viz, textiles, motor transport, drugs, machinery. But we hope for some increase in the amounts available for commercial exports. (b) After the Japanese armistice there will be temporary problems of unscrambling, but we then hope to increase our exports very considerably. (c) If we have to have recourse to directing our scarcer exports. Persia should on present evidence qualify for a fairly high priority. But in the meantime we shall have to keep the Persians in play as best we can (see paragraph 2 (c)). 5. Anglo-Persian financial relations after the war will be determined primarily by the need to secure the orderly and prudent spending of Persian sterling balance^ Until these balances have been liquidated, there will be no case for granting loans or credits or for encouraging the investment of British capital in Persia, It will therefore be for the Persians themselves to finance any projects of capital works etc. which they may be planning.4. This can he cbne either by the PersianGovcrnment creating^^ . 8 trs.£ e^g.inthe form of public utility companies. )asis.

I am not aware of the plans the Persian Government may have under consideration for the commercial development of Ports in Southern Iran after the war, it seems clear however that any such plans cannot altogether ignore the vast improvements which have been effected, for purely military reasons, in the Port of iChorramshahr during the past two years; and that sooner or later some attention will have to be paid to putting what remains of the facilities now available to the best commercial use. As an example of the development which has taken place ^ I would mention that two years ago the capacity of the Port was roughly 1000 tons a month; there was no railway and no jetty; while to-day the port can deal with as much as 4000 tons of cargo a day ; there are jetties large enough to berth seven ocean going ships at a time and a link of the main trans-Persian Railway extends up to the Customs jetties and Port area. With these facilities available there is no doubt that, given due attention, Khorramshahr can be developed into a port of considerable importance for dealing with trade, not only for the interior of Persia but also with transit trade fof markets in Russia and perhaps even eastern Europe. I would accordingly suggest that as an earnest of our intention to bring tangible benefits in the economic field we should offer to the Persian Government the services of expert technicians and town planners to study the problem of developing on commercial lines the existing facilities of the Port, which have been built purely with regard to military necessity. Such development would not only render invaluable service I to the Persian Government but also to our own trade, more particularly that of India, which must inevitably search for new markets to absorb the increased supply of manufactured goods which will be avialhble for export as a result of the industrialisation which has taken place there during the war years.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a Savingram, No. 143 of the 5th October 194o, to the Foreign Office which discusses action to be taken now to facilitiate British propaganda in Persia. It represents the views of the Commercial Secretariat and the Public Relations Bureau of this Legation and the British Council in Persia. The Middle Fast Supply Centre, Tehran, have also been good enough to give their views, which are incorporated in this communication. 2. Copies of this Savingram have been sent also to H.M. Consular Officers in Persia, who were invited to furnish their observations. The enclosed copy of a despatch from H.M.Consul at Khorramshahr is in reply to that circular. It is forwarded as being ot possible interest to the Department in connection with post-war commercial conditions in Persia. There is little doubt that Khorramshahr, due to the extensive development that has taken place there for war purposes, will in future be the principal port of entry for goods coming to Persia.

During earlier part of the war chief role of our propaganda victory Pa H ia te nilitar y set-backs and keep up confidence in final • ??. N° w that tide of war is turning in our favour this purely Propaganda must to a large and growing extent be super- seded by # propaganda designed to prove to Persians that association n ls Lringing and will bring them tangible benefits in--the political and economic fields. 5. To be effective, such propaganda must be backed by some degree oi concrete economic and other assistance as earnest of His Majesty s Government s declared intention to see Persia strong and independent after the war. 4. # Active measures are being taken to ensure full publicity for assistance at present receivea by Persia. Latter however remains inadequate as a basis for propaganda on lines of (2) above and must be supplemented if such propaganda is to yield results. This is a matter of urgency since Allied occupation of Persia offers except ionally favourable.conditions, which may not persist after the war, lor extending and advertising such economic and other benefits as our resources may permit. 5. Following suggestions for immediate assistance to Persia have accordingly been elaborated and I would recommend that they be carefully considered with a view to determining how far His Majesty s Government are m fact able and willing to assist Persia and how lar our propaganda can consequently go in promising and advertising such assistance. Details of ihese suggestions are being communicated to their headquarters by the various departments con c g m g u. % 6. (a) Increased import quotas . V 4 .V x quotas fixed by the Middle East Supply Centre have hitherto been based on 'essential minimum requirements.' A general increase of all these quotas and the raising of the ban on certain imports (e.g. hats, footwear, certain toilet goods) con sidered not essential would help Persian economy. /(b) /4-SV - 2 - V / i (b) A special effort should be made to supply more ^ machinery (especially Diesel engines) and spare parts (mainly fo^ 'ierman engine s). (c) Development of trade with India . This would of course be of mutual benefit to Persia and India and would also indirectly benefit British interests and influence* An essential step is the appointment of an Indian Trade Commissioner ih Tehran, (d) Air Transport . Persia has poor ground communications and is there fore a promising field for the development of air transport, Persian State Airlines have urgently requested one or at most two snail (DH 89) aircraft from us and provision of these would greatly ease present transport difficulties and increase the dentral Government's authority in the provinces. If we do not provide them Americans will doubtless do so sooner or later, (e) Public Works and Industrial Development , There is enormous scope f&lt;Dr irrigation and^hydro electric development in which British firms might participate, ihe first would help Persia's basic industry, agriculture, and at the same time provide water power for industrial development. The Tehran area has good possibilities of this kind which are being investigated by American irrigation adviser to the Persian Government, Furthermore, the capital has not yet a piped water supply. Similar development can be carried out in and near other large cities. With cheap power available industry ^especially chemical), mining and transport could be developed with profit, (f) Technical Help . (i) The ex-Shah's programme of industrialisation required the help of European technicians to build and run factories. Many of these were Germans. It will be some years before the Persians are good enough engineers and administrators to be independent of foreign help: and we now have an excellent opportunity of getting rid of German influence, which is still very . strong in the commercial community, by placing British technicians and machinery in the industries and factories. The Middle East Supply Centre has a nucleus of British specialists who are working to keep Persian industry operating and would be an excellent channel through whom permanent appointments of this kind could be made. . (ii) Experts are needed for the textile industry (especially the cotton section) to improve metnods of production and to advise on the maintenance of existing equipment and the ordering of more machinery. They would also select young Persians for training m the United Kingdom. The r ailw ay needs trained men to take . • /overover from the Americans after the war. These should ^ receive their training in the United Kingdom. Further more. these young technicians would be able to replace British technicians if the latter should go. Their training in England could be effected by means of British Council scholarships. Candidates should be sent for theoretical training in the Universities and for practical training in the factories. British professors should be appointed to the Technical Colleges under the control of the Ministry of Industry. Commerce and Mines* The.British Council is now teaching English to the students in these colleges and within a year or less it will be possible to give instruction on technical subjects in the English language. The Germans staffed these colleges with their own people and . used the German language for instructional purposes, German being compulsory until as recently as the end of the last school term. Five professors are needed for the Tehran College and three for the Isfahan College. (g) Cultural Actjtities . The British Council could extend their activities by opening Institutes in Shiraz, Ramadan, Meshed. Tabriz and‘Abadan. Each would require a staff or three people^ i.e. fifteen in all. The Tehran Institute could usefully employ*another five. It would be invaluable having professors appointed by them to Tehran University, where six could'be placed. 'One professor for the Kerej Agricultural College, twelve teachers of English in other institutions, ten in secondary schools, physical training instructors, games coaches and scoutmasters appointed and financed by the British Council enormously increase the' scope of British cultural propaganda. After the war, given .a stable Government in Persia, the financial liability of the British Council in this respect could probably be reduced to about two-thirds of the cost, the Persian Government bearing the rest. (h) Medical assistance. % This is clearly one of the most effective forms of propaganda amongst a backward and disease-ridden country population and valuable work has already been achieved by the enterprise of a local British subject (Miss Palmer-Smith) in establishing, with the help of willing and influential Persians, clinics and health centres in Tehran and the nrovinces; and by the recent provision of a mobile dispensary by G.H.Q. Paic. Latter work should if possible be repeated and extended and approach has been made in this connexion to the Minister of State, Cairo, and to the Government of India, (j) Armed Forces . It would greatly assist our credit, more especially with this section of the nation (ill-disposed towards us since /» the occupation, except for the Air Force;, if we could (i) facili tate arrival or supplies and material recommended by United States Army adviser; (ii) definitely promise to rehabilitate the Persian Navy as soon as possible - perhaps when Germany is /defeated(4) defeated and more small vessels are set free than can he employed in the Far East; \ : (iii) help the Air Force to reconstruct itself on British model, . j.' 7. All the above are ways in which it is suggested Persia could receive assistance which Yfould justify our propaganda, remove to same extent the odium created by Allied occupation and its economic consequences and lay the. foundations of lasting British prestige and influence in this country, Persians will, however, judge the advantages of association v/ith Great Britain chiefly from what is offered for the post-war period. Hence British propaganda, if it is to convince -the Persians on this point, must even at. present be based to some extent on the advantages.Great Britain.is prepared to offer them commercially when the war is over. . It is difficult at this stage to recommend the exact lines on which Great Britain’s post-war trade policy towards Persia should run, as it will clearly depend on the political status of the country after the war and on Britain’s policy in general towards her major allies. The question will, however, be ”how and by whom will Persia’s economic wnntis be satisfied”? Assuming that.Great •• ritain wished to be one. of the chief a.gencies in fulfilling this, the action she must take would be a continuation and widening of that suggested in the .preceding paragraph,. Details of Persian import requirements'and development possibilities were sent m September 1942 by the Commercial Secretary to. His Majesty s . Legation to the Department of Overseas Trade, for the information of the Post-Tfrr Export Trade Committee presided over by Mr. Harcourt Johnston, P.C.yM.P. The Information in this report will be., brought up to date and a further report furnished as soon as possible as a first step in the campaign to prepare for the resumption of British trade in Persia. .. . 8, The previous paragraphs are concerned with what Treat Britain might contribute to Persia. It.will, however, also -&gt;e necessary, if a strong position is to be built up in Persia, to •ake from her a share of her products bearing, some relation to tne mins of those she buys from Great Britain; or at least to ensure that she is able to dispose of her own exportable surpluses in Dther markets under some system of international clearing k such, as the Keynes Plan) that will prevent her becoming tied to a part c - lar country in the way she was to Germany before the war. It is, however, useful to beer in oind that Geruany's considerable popular ity in Persia was due tc the fact that trade between the two countries was a acre cr less nutually satisfactory exchange of B^sB Only scac -systea that satisfies the above condition will rive lasting satisfaction to both parties and provide a secure Kosis fr r building up British influence in Persia. .• : [Copies sent to Mr. Arustrong.]Personal.

We have considered the points raised in the Government of India's telegrams and agree that their views should be borne in R.T. Peel, Esq..,/■»-&lt;*-r*•* MM With the compliments af Mr. J.I.

In view of the telegrams which I see passing on the three comere^route between India, Persia and the foreign Office, I feel all the more strongly that Hullard ought to be fully seized ofy^ir point of view in reg(.o*d to Persian finance and economics You will remember that you suggested that ray fuller telegram about Persian finance should not be sent off in view of the fact that you had already touched on this subject in Telegram Ko. 10^2. +Tk*6 IvaS Ah *aZL&amp;x tcUf^ar* - /ic 4AJWe* Unfortunately the foreign Office he ve chosen &lt;iot to circulate either this telegram or its answer. Ho. 1149 f from Tehran, to the Treasury. This makes it rather hard to say very much at the moment, but as soon as I obtain them I think we must concoct a full and definite line of advice for bullard. It occurs to me also that there will be a tendency for I.T.M. Pink, Esq., . . thethe Persian Government to take its ease and, if anything goes isiTong, simply blame it on the iiritish. This may be the case particularly in regard to the wheat position. In former years Persia was usually able to export a surplus of wheat. It is really for the Persian Government to take the hoarders by the neck and shake the wheat out of them. In addition, I think It has been fairly obvious for some time that .Bullard i ^ close touch with the U.K.C.C. repre sentative .^ otherwise h^^ould not have senx a telegram sucn as no. 11 t^ At a meeting recently, at which this telegram was discussed, it was found that the wnole Persian programme had been met up to the end of December and I think Bullard has/been so Informed. /*Please see the note at EXT. 7431/43, flagged.

As regards paragraph 2 of the Government of India*s telegram, I think it is admitted on all sides that the immediate need of the Persian Government is for rials rather than for sterling or other foreign exchange. I understand from the Treasury, however, that the Persian Goverrarent can obtain the rials needed to carry on their administration by selling some of their surplus sterling to the Imperial Bank of Iran, who will give them rials in return. If this is so, the Government of India* s argument that the Persians are not in a position to inport very much really runs counter to their own case; since this restriction on inports should leave the Persian Government with more sterling with which to buy rials. In view of this and of the other considerations set out in the note at EXT. 7431/41, it is proposed to do no more than ask the P.0, (a) to bear the Government of India* s views in mind when the time comes to implement the treaty and (b) to let us have their views on both the Government of India's telegrams on this subject together. A draft for this purpose follows. Secretary, E.&amp;.O. Departn^enti For'any observations - * JLif' X(EXT. 7500/41 IMMEDIATE. BY HAND. DRAFT LETTER. C.W.

It would be a misfortune, he thought, if this Government were compelled to resign and Majlis might not approve the terms. The Minister asked in particular whether we could not agree more explicitly to Persia having a place at the peace conference and above all whether we could not improve Article 7 regarding economic help. 2. I told the Minister that I was sorry I could not meet him on either of these points. Jis regards the peace conference it was impossible.to gp further, than I was proposing, since I could not visualise the circumstances in which peace would eventually be made. 3. As regards financial help! could not accept that the Persian Government were in difficulty there. They had considerable sterling balances available in this country which were at present frozen. These they would be able to use as soon as the Treaty was signed. I understood that Persian assets in the United States were now estimated at 'll million dollars. I suggested that.what Persia needed was not money, but goods. We were doing our best to help in this and were shipping further supplies of wheat to Persia before the end of the year. The Minister.remarked that his Government had not mentioned food in their telegram to him. I replied that this was none the less a most serious matter'that confronted Persia. Her people.were, very short of food and we were trying to help them m this as in other matters. 4. Broadly the choice for Persia was clear. _If she became an ally she would be in the same category as Egypt, Iraq, and Turkey, to all of v/hom we were sending supplies and all of whom we had helped as far as we.could in respect of their export trade. If, however, Persia was not an ally, • she/ **Coi POt, ?i&gt;NOV' r INDM2. she could not expect to continue to receive the favourable treatment which we had been giving her, and we should then regard ourselves as under no treaty obligation cowarcis ^ Persia whatever. 5. I then read to the Minister the last two . senten ces o f my tele gram No. 1042 to you. The minister continued to piead for Lne inclusion of some lh±ng-~~further in the Treaty which would give it a popular appeal. 1 replied that I had been through the text most carelully and I had accepted, subject to the approval of our Soviet allv. a number of Persian amendments. I could now go no further. As soon as you had received the agreement of your Soviet colleague, you would see the Persian G-overnmen and put the full text as now proposed before them. I hoped, that the Minister would use his utmost influence^to advise his Government to accept this Treaty without furuher aelay. I was confident that it was in Persia s interests to do this. 6. The Minister would remember that we and the Soviet Government had withdrav/n our troops from Tehran^some time ago, There had been some criticism of us for that acuion. ine Minister said that we were entirely right to try to get the confidence of the Persian Government and.people. 1 said if that were so, it was now for the Persian Government to prove that the confidence of their friends was justified. I quite understood that the Persian. Government naght think; that they might meet with some criticism from the Majlis,, but since what they were doing was in the interest of their country they should have the courage to face up to that. 7. The Minister was friendly but worried. .1 hope that I may have been able to put some heart into him. I made it plain that I was not able to discuss amendments with him, and that the detailed text of.the negotiations was in your hands at Tehran. This ho readily accepted.U-S-S. Cn —&amp; 9l Aow^, £ 4 ^&gt;^,4 &lt;e. /?. %. »v s~U/JL ^ l^^'-x Ul^C/ C ^ r ^ ^ Below these papers will be found * C Qr'' ^ ^ (a) the text of Article 7 of the Anglo-bo vie t-^ ,A ^ w ^ Persian Treaty originally suggested by the Foreign Office, and (b) that suggested by the Persian Government. The Persian draft was found unacceptable here, and the addition at the top of page 2 of Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No. 1021 was suggested instead. Sir E. Bullard ! s comments will be found in the side-lined passages in Tehran telegrams Nog. 1145 and 1149. The Foreign Office have now given the Soviet Ambassador a revised draft of the Treaty, and have suggested that his Government should instruct the Soviet Minister at Tehran to join with Sir. R. Bullard in informing 1he Persian Government that we must require them to accept this version. For the reasons given in paragraph^ 3 of the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No. 1042, it has been decided to go no farther than the draft of Article 7 put forward in Foreign Office telegram No. 1021. Foreign Office -telegram No. 1042 has^ crossed the Government of India’s telegram.No. 6514, which has thus arrived too late to be able to alter His Majesty’s Government’s decision. As I understand the position, the contention of the Foreign Office and the Treasury is that the Persian Government have plenty of sterling in hand, arid that there is no question of tneir needing- a z ^loan to tide them over until they receive the next l((\\ instalment of A.I*0.C. royalties. The presence of the British forces in Persia will; also lead to an influx of sterling, inc.itttling payments for goods.and services supplied in connection with the transport of goods to Russia. On the other hand, Persia is unable in the present circumstances to import very much from the sterling areef*, so that the sterling ’ou acquired will remain in the country. The resulting e/s*. situation, in which there will be a considerable amount of exchange in Persia but few goods to spend it on, may lead to inflation; and any loan or gift from His Majesty’s Government would of course /accentuate pi “v™accentuate this danger. I understand from the Foreign office that an additional reason for their decision not to offer financial assistance is that intercepted telegrams between the Persian Foreign Ministry and the Legation in London have shown that the Persian Government does not really want a loan. (This, of course, does not mean that they would not 1115:6 * gift.) 1- fafAft The Foreign Office also tell me that, although they do not consider that the Persians need foreign exchange, they appreciate that * owing to the disorganisation of the country and •wfjuiftuJ IWthe subsequent shortfall of revenue they are , , , badly in need of rials. To remedy'this, the TUi p or eign Office propose^ that the Persian Government should float an internal loan. They do not think it should take unduly long to raise money in this way. It is proposed simply to tell the' Foreign Office that while we do not feel that, on the basis of the Government of India’s tefegram, we can contes t the de cision not to give financial assistance to~~persia, wej^viouitj pc grate-ful' for matorial-'-wiith v^h-ioh fPe. ^ ^ u Co i&amp;fack Ve. &lt;0 a u /&gt;q . n ^ Wl’sA Sc wm&gt; «u mWj ^ ^ ^ Vlu 1 upty — trr bhe Goveiruvient of India '±-R- rathe i n tfte ro ■ (telegram' -to. , lOd^-» it draft for thi-fr ; TV J. w 0.0 P^r3»p0 0» follows r . , - - „ , X tabi.

There are three issues raised in this correspondence. (a) Whether we should give financial assistance to Persia. I agree that in view of our secret information that the Persians do not really want such assistance there is no purpose in pursuing the matter at the moment and that we cannot question the Foreign Office's decision to refuse to incorporate any undertaking on the subject in the treaty, (b) Whether we should accede to the Persian request that we should buy their produce and facilitate their imports. I agree on the whole with the Foreign Office that we should not enter into any obligation on this point as part of the treaty. We are in fact doing everything that is possible in view of the shipping and port situation to assist Persia's imports. We may have to buy some more Persian produce (e.g. Persian cotton) but it seems best not to pursue this at the moment. (c) Whether we should support the G-overnment of India's proposal that the Persians should be given an Economic Adviser. This has nothing to do with the treaty as such. It seems to me to be a sound idea that there should be more qualified economic and financial advice at Tehran than there is at present. Whether it should take the form of an American Economic or Financial Adviser attached to the Persian Government or of the strengthening of the staff of H.M. Legation by the addition of an economic expert who would carry some guns is a point which is more open to question. I am at present rather inclined to favour the latter. The advice of an expert attached to the Legation would be available informally to the Persian Government and he could be appointed without consultation with the Russians. My/My impression is that the Legation is at present very weak on the commercial side. 'VV.'kC 'WV .r DRAFT. livim^DiUTA - BY HaIID. 0 . »&lt;. Baxter, usq. ,Q*l(r { P]c Foreign Office. Ext. 7431/41. iVOy ^ Copy to J.i. Cook, Treasury, K.a.F. Rumbold, E &amp; 0 Dept. Dear Baxter, Will you please refer to the Government of India’s telegram No. 6514 of November 19th (further copy herewith) on the question of granting financial assistance to Persia. This telegram has crossed the repetition to India of Foreign Office telegram to Tehran No. 1042 of November 18th, instructing Sir R. Bullard, in conjunction with the Soviet representative, to inform the Persian Government that we must require CL them to accept version of the Treaty which, inter alia, goes no further than the present draft of Article 7. While we do not, in these circumstances, feel that we 'J'-f'-t' fKoJT CaTr^QujQbeat % this decision, we t-e ^ lauo to- vg. the Government of Indiu^ /essential foodstuffs will involve large expenditure at a time when insecurity and disorganisation have greatly affected revenues* 3* It may “be that Persian G-overnmant’s j- conception of the extent of financial assistance required will go fa? 'beyond wsat H«M»3-ovarnment could contemplate- But in our view the grant of short term credits on easy terms is inevitable and should 'be admitted forthwith while making it clear in such manner as Ballard may find most appropriate that these credits will not go beyond sun contemplated in 1940c- 4o It was with these considerations in mind that we ourselves suggested to Bullard the appointment of American financial and economic advisers and we have much sympathy for other arguments which he .now advances*Ext.7392/41. Extract from Secret Telegram No.1149, from Tehran to Foreign Office, dated 16th Noveriber, 1941. A* i 4. The question of financial assistance is admittedly more difficult hut apart from the fact that, as I have said before, we S ^ a -H have to assist Persia financially sooner or later, I v/ould advance three arguments in support of ray proposal (a) Persia would naturally think it highly unlikely that we gave British protection to the late Shah, and refused help to present regime, (b) grant of financial assistance would give us the right oi criticism of finance and revenue administration. The suggestion has been made in various quarters (most recently as a private enquiry from Simla) that foreign adviser should be employed by the Persian Government. Only adviser we could recommend would, I think, be Americans, (sic). Previous experience has not been happy but in present circumstances Americans might be less hostile to or it ish influence, 'while the Russians being dependent on American help, might be less hostile to the adviser. Negotiation of an agreement for financial assistance v/ould enable us to raise the adviser question if we thought fit, (c) in considering the amount2 . of financial help to be indicated in the proposed agreement, v/e should require to examine the revenue resources of Persia and a would make it easier to discuss with the Russians certain methods they use to detract Persian revenue, in iry telegram No. 8 Saving November lOtn, I reported that the Russians were selling goods without paying customs dues, in contravention of their ovm commercial trea y and this is still going on.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000051_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3521</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000051</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3521</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 28/110 ‘Persia.
