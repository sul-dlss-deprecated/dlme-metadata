H^an.-ren, 1049 tons, sailed from Calcutta to Bahrain via Bombay and Karachi. It is said that the voyage from Calcutta was deiayed by stormy wet weather up the west coast of India; the ship was then laden wit. 20,633 packages, of which all hut 513 were hags or pockets of rice. At Bombay the ship took in 2,836 packages, mostly sugar, and was sent thence to Karachi. T hed always understood that the ship had been chartered at Calcutta by^the three brothers who form the firm of Messrs Bhamanmal Isardas,and it was known to me that certain local merchants were trying to 'bring forward cargo from Karachi in this ship, on account of the lower rate of freight offered hy the Agent there, as compared with the B. I. S.N. Coy ’ s rates; 'but Mr Tickamdas of this firm has since informed that his firm are only shippers, and certainly most of the cargo is consigned to them, and they act locally as the Agents having Been approved By the Government of Bahrain for that purpose. The ship remained at Karachi for some time, and sailed av/ay with 1,227 packages for Bahrain, and also aBout 5,900 Bags o_ rlce -by one Marzuk, the local agent of ABdulaziz Aly Al..assam, a Keidy merchant living in Bahrain, which cargo was intended to Be landed if possible at Ras Tanura, or at A,iair in A^a ia. ,s;*;:Ens; x? a s where she was. and was told her position was between the outer, white buoy, and the inner, redbuoy.

These have been duly cleared through the Customs, and the following amounts collected: Import Yard charges Ps 7,049. 6. 3/ The above 15£ of defective cargo is not surprising when one considers the type of craft used in the discharge, namely local open latinches * and local open sailing craft, the weather conditions, and the positioM/ of the shj.p. xn effect the discharge was unsatisfactory, and implies carelessness on the part of those responsible, i.e. the local agents. Two motor launches, one containing 260 bags of sugar, and the other 138 bags of sugar were damaged at the ship’s side, and all contents damaged. The enclosed statement (summarised above) will shew exactly which craft were used; and it is my opinion that the cause of the / heavy r?tio of damage was inexperienced and careless over-loading of the local craft in stormy weather, and the responsibility for this shou! a naturally fall upon the agents, who, it so happens, are the largest consignees of the cargo. into charge of which 21,005 were accepted as sound, and 3,711 (i.e.15^) as defective; of these 3,104 appeared to be damaged It will thus be seen that 24,716 packages were taken by sea-water.

You may be interested to hear that a Japanese ship hasxjust landed in Bahrain some 13,000 bags of Japanese cement. Ihe cement is said (though I am not yet certain oi this) to be selling in the bazaar at Rs.1/4/- a bag. I am tola that r orbandar cement which previously sold at Rs.3/- a bag is now offered at Rs.2/8/-. 3. I was out at the oil field of r ihe Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited yesteraay and took the liberty of mentioning your name and that of The Cement .arketjtjing Company to the Chief Local Representative (Mr.E.A.Skinner),and of saying that I understood that the Company were underselling Japan m India, though I did not whether they would do so in the Gulf. I did this as Ihe Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited are about to embark on a large development scheme including the building of houses and so on. it might be worth your Company getting into touch with The Bahrain Petroleum Company in this connection. 4.

Sfcee/; 16th February 1934 Dear Colonel Loch, / I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 16th'\January and for the useful infor mation contained therein. We have been experiencing a great deal of difficulty in this country with Japanese competition as their Exporters have been offering cement C. I# F. Indian Ports at prices far below the cost of manufacture, the only inference to be drawn from this is that Japanese Manufacturers receive assistance. Similarly they appear to be adopting the same tactics with regard to the Persian markets, but we are taking steps to retain some interest therein although we may experience difficulty in being able to compete to any large extent. Again thanking you for the interest you have shown in this matter, Yours truly, Lt. Col. G. Loch, The Political Agency, BAHREIN. 1 -7The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to H.

Quite apart froa the importance to India of the air route and oil, I should like to direct attention to an increasing market for Indian products and a sow-11 but potentially increasing field of employment for Indians* 2 # It, is interesting to observe that tne Netherlands found Bahrain alone of sufficient interest commercially to send a Tr^de Comiuissioner here on his way to Java* His visit happened a few days after a very live director of the Hansa line had spent a week in Bahrain* These visits show how other countries regard the prospects in these parts* tne present uoaent Bahrain is the only place where there is sn oil field and a refinery in full running order but the Americans have struck oil In Hssa, Just across the water fro® Bahrain, and they are going ahead hard there.

At the pr^s^at momnt the Japanese hold a preuoc&amp;nant share of the Bahrain sarket, but anti-Japanese feeling here is pretty strong! e «d it would be reasonable enough to use this feeling to help in direrting a proportion of the Japanese business here, p roxldea Indie, can offer slmlxsr goods at rcttsona^-rC prices* 5 .

I am at present Political Agent in Bahrain, and as no doubt you know, Bahrain is now the proud possessor of a con siderable oil field and a very modem refinery. The Bahrain Petroleum Company is an American concern in which the shares are held jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Oil Company, but as it is operating in an Arab Shaikh- dom which enjoys British protection the Company has undertaken to employ as many British subjects as possible in all its ope rations. At the present moment one of its Vice-Presidents, an American named Mr. Max Thomberg, is in Bahrain, and he has asked if I can help him in ,f establishing contacts” in Cambridge whereby the Company may be able to recruit University men of the best type for employment here. He emphasises that he does not necessarily want men with any tecJinlcal education since his people prefer to teach 'oil” in their own way, but they do want men who are prepared to start at the bottom and who have the character, determination and natural ability to get to the top against fairly fierce competition in all depart ments — production, refinery, personnel, general management and so on* 3. The Company* s attitude to the whole question is extreme ly reasonable. They are genuinely anxious to carry out their undertaking/- Spens, Esquire, M.A*, Master of Corpus Christ! College, Cambridge•undertaking to employ British personnel, but they say that if they are to do so they must have the best* Oil is far from being a feather-bed occupation and both character and ability are in dispensable to success. But the ultimate rewards are high for those who can stay the course* 4. At the present moment the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s Refinery Manager, an American named Mr. W.R* Anderson, is in England and I expect he will shortly ask for an interview with you on this matter. I do hope you will not think that I have give him some advice and assistance in making contact with the right people in Cambridge, I should be most deeply grateful. You will, I think, find him rather shy and reserved but he is, as the Americans put it, a highly efficient executive. 5* The Arab side of the Persian Gulf is a most interesting part of the world, and a very great change from India v/here I have been for the past fifteen years. Everywhere there is talk of oil and though these are still early days, we may see tremen dous development in the next ten years. 6.

From employment of all kinds in this Agency, other than that paid for from Government of India funds, Indian nationals are earning in wages roughly Rs 13^ lakhs per annum. This does, it is true, include close on ffe 2 lakhs for the wage bill of Indians in the employment of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in Hasa, but Hasa comes very much within the Bahrain orbit. From business I calculate that Indian merchants in Bahrein alone earn a minimum of some hs 10 to 12 lakhs annually. It is almost impossible to work out accurate figures under this head but these take account of information which we have been collecting in the course of investigations for the purpose * of price control. Thus Indian nationals living in or on the border of this Agency are earning something like Bs 25 lakhs annually. 3/— The Honourable Major C.G. Prior, C.I.B., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait.- 2 - 3* The above figures do not of course exhibit in any way the profits made in India from exports to the States comprising the Bahrain Agency* Exports to Bahrain alone from India have risen from Ha* 42 lakhs in 1933-34 to Bs* 64 lakhs in 1938-39* The figure was actually Rs 70 lakhs in 1937-38 but included a very high total for specie. I do not have here information to enable me to estimate the profit^ made in India on this total of exports, but it cannot be inconsiderable, and, I might add, might very well be increased. These figures too take no account of exports to the Trucial Coast. It would be impossible in present circumstances to discover what proportion of the Rs 40 or ^0 lakhsf worth of goods said to be re-exported from Dubai and other Trucial Coast ports annually into Persia is of Indian origin, but this too cannot be a negligible figure* 4* That my estimates for Bahrain are not exaggerated is ' sufficiently evident from the volume of remittances to India through the Bank and through the Post Office* The Eastern Bank has remitted to India in the last 21 months just over Rs 1 crore, while money orders issued by the Post Office on India average well over Rs 4 lakhs per annum* 5* It is interesting also to note that the number of British Indians registered in the Agency has increased from 460 in 1930 to 1560 in 1938. That this number will increase I am firmly convinced. Oil prospects in Qatar now seem quite good and when the war■is over there is bound to be development1 CoiU'ldeKtlal ^3 Government of India Ministry of External Affairs &amp; Commonwealth Relations.
