Stage 3. — Delete entries under water, fuel, fodder and substi tute :—■ See Route II (x), stage 5. Route No. II (w). Delete whole entry and substitute :— RUD-I-MAHI to DUZDAP. Distance 86|- miles. 3 stages. Authority. —E. P. Cordon, 1918. Epitome. —At present the track is scarcely fit for pack ani mals, camels suffering terribly in the first stage. A motor road could, however, be made with very little difficulty. A small detour would have to be made at Dar-i-Shur, otherwise the work would be quite straight forward. Good road metal obtainable from Rud-i-Mahi to Asharu, thence practically nil. As far as Asharu the track lies along torrent beds, thence to 7 miles E. of Durnag over plains, then rolling hills and torrent beds to Harneh, from there to Duzdap over plains. Stages. —It would be better to split the first stage at Asharu. Water. —Sufficient for a brigade at all times of the year. Fuel. —Abundant. Grazing. —Abundant camel grazing. Supplies. —Generally nil, but in normal times sheep and goats can be obtained, up to about 100, at each stage, also along the C302GSBI 2 Route No. II (w)— contd. route. A certain amount of barley can be obtained at stages 1 and 3, also at Kalepada and Asharu. No. of stage and total distance. 1 Details. 1 DAR-I-SHUR .. 36£ m. General direction (5,425') / E.-N.-E. There is no 36£ m. ! track from Rud-i-Mahi to Asharu. Route starts off S.-S.-E. ascending large torrent and stream bed through tamarisk forest and keeping in torrent bed which winds about, reaches source of Rud-i-Mahi stream in quantity of elephant grass at 3 miles. Route continues in tor rent bed winding along through high hills and at 10J miles bifur cates running up smaller torrent bed to N., the main torrent bed with tamarisk forest continues on the Galugah route. Tama risk stops completely at turn off, but continues on Galugah route. Route continues up barren torrent bed and point where Kalepada stream disappears is reached at 11£ miles and tama risk forest begins. Kalepada is reached at 12 miles in corner of bend of torrent bed. (Crops | acre—excellent and abundant water from stream. Food supplies m7. Tamarisk forest.) Route continues up torrent bed and at 13} miles source of Kalepada stream is reached and at 14} miles tamarisk forest ends. Route still continues up torrent bed going generally N. and keeping on E. side and at 23 miles bifurcates and bears N.-N.-E. (Route to N.-N.-W. is Gurg route). At 24} miles Asharu is reached. Asharu has 10 acres crops ; excellent and abundant water from spring and karez ; food sup plies nil, but in normal times sheep and goats obtainable up to 100 ; tamarisk jungle. Track is now found and g^ing E. alongside foot hills proceeds over plain to low foothills jutting out into plain. At 25} miles karez of very fair water is passed giving about 4 gallons per minute Route then enters torrent bed and track disappears and keeping in this winds through aforementioned low foothills and at 27} miles passes ; out S.-E. into plain; then at about 110° runs over plain to foothills passing between small isolated red hillocks, then keeping close to foothills and going generally S.-E., track isRoute No. II ( w )— contd. found and passes through lower edge of undulating ground at 31.V miles. Hills then recede to S. and point must be taken from last hillock of undulating ground at side of track at 131 to clearly defined sharp peak in hills on other side of plain, and Dar-i-Shur is \ mile N.-W. of foot of this. A motor road could be made. with very little difficulty to Dar-i-Shur. Campinq ground. —Unlimited. . TFcder.—Good and abundant from a Icarez. There is also a qantat a giving good supply 1 m. to the N. ... Fuel. —Abundant. Grazing. —Abundant camel grazing. Supplies. —Supplies generally nil, but sheep and goats up to about 100 obtainable in normal times. About 6 acres crops. 2 HARNEH •• 28 m. General direction / 5 875'). E.-S.-E. Track clearly ’ * defined leaves Dar-i-Shur eoinff E.-S.-E. through pass in hills passing sharp peak on N; side at 1 mile. At sharp corner where track emerges from pass on to plain at 2 miles, line must be taken at 13b straight over plain to small isolated white hillock. Track then disappears and route runs across plain at about 77° entering undulating ground at 13 miles and rolling hills at 14 mde^ where track is found. Track then runs more or less straight through rolling hills almost due E. and at 18 miles Kamisaru is reached. Note-- Well of very good water giving about 6 gallons per minute.) Track bifurcates here and bears E.-S.-E. bearing E. alsol eaves to Hameh.) Track continues through rolling hills to 18* miles when it runs out into small plain passing on N. side of Koh-i-Guh. -Track at 19^ miles enters and runs down torrent bed through tamarisk jungle to 25 miles where track is found on N. side and torrent bed opens out into plain amongst tama k jungle. A motor road could easily be made to Hameh, but would have to be brought round two miles N. of Dar-i-Shur over rolling hills on to Dumag plain. Camping ground. —^Unlimited. Water. —3 separate springs of very good butslighaybrackish water, giving a total of about 14 gallons per minute and flowing for about 150 yards.

N -- E - track very clearly defined bifurcates at 3 miles keeping straight on N.-N.-E. over undulating plain. The track bearing N. goes to Manzilaf. At 7 miles track entering torrent bed where track disappears passes between foothills. Route runs along in W. side of torrent bed going N. and at 11 miles track is found and runs up side of torrent bed into undulating ground. Track is very clearly defined from here to stage and is aligned for some miles with small stone cairn . Route then opens into large plain, track leads across this goin 0 N.-N.-E. to stage. A motor road could easily be made from Hameh to Duzdap. See Route III, stage 21. . Route No. II (x). Delete whole entry and substitute: — ROBAT to GALUGAH. Distance 74| miles. ^stages. Authority. —E. P. Cordon, 1918. Epitome. —Passable by camels and Field Artillery, though latter might experience some difficulty in stage 1. A motor road could be made along this route, a little cutting required in stage 1, otherwise easy. The first stage runs through torrent beds, the remainder over plains. The country is under the administration of Sardar Juma Khan. —Normally there would be sufficient water at all times of the year for a force of 2 squadrons of cavalry and 1 battalion of infantry, but see under stages,5 Route No. II (x)—conld. Fuel. —Plentiful. Grazing .—Abundant camel grazing. Supplies. — Nil, but sheep and goats could be obtained at stages 4 and 5. r ' ■ e ratabad route ascending Shamedar torrent bed going first W.- S.-W. for 11 miles then VV.-N.-W. to 31 miles, keeping close to hills on N. side of road, then bifurcates, Nasratabad route pro ceeding to Dewan Chah and Pipli route runs straight up torrent bed through rolling hills almost due W. At mile 7 pass in Yak Pada foothills is reached, which pass can oe seen from point where road bifurcates and is at point to which brownish yellow foothills slope down on either side, joining bistan-Bampur track at 6J miles. There is a very small sprint of good water at corner and track turns sharply to S. passing Shamedar (2 springs of good water giving total 6 gallons per minute) at miles and track again bifurcates at 12 miles, main track proceeding on S. to Duzdap and runs W.-S.-W. up torrent bed nullah which winds up to stage. This is the first nullah leading off to the W. after entering pass at 7 miles and the turn off is marked by a small stone cairn on a hillock out side mouth of nullah. A motor road could easily be made from Robat to Pipli. Road metal abundant. Camping ground .—For 2 battalions. Water .—Pipli has a spring of good but slightly brackish water giving about 5 gallons per minute except during the months of June, July and August—this same spring travelling beneath the surface soil breaks out in three other places at short intervals down the nullah. The source of the spring is in a small nullah leading off on the N. side of the main nullah at stage. In June, July and August this spring is more or less dry but Shamedar could be made stage 1 instead as it has a constant and perennial flow of about 6 gallons per minute. Details.

Supplies. —N il. 2 PATKI . (5,300') * . 15 m. General direction 28-J- m. S.-W. Route ascends nullah bed for 1 mile to watershed plateau then runs down narrow torrent bed opening out S.-S.-W. into plain at 2 miles. Track then disappears and line must be taken at about 218° to pass through foot of low hills. 3 rack appears again on other side of these at 4J miles and going almost in a straight line at 225° passes round foot of hills at 8 miles. From here route runs still over plain at about 212° through pass in hills at 10 miles. From here there are several misleading tracks so straight line should be taken at about 210° across large plain to very small isolated white hillock clearly visible and stage is £ mile at 195° from this at foot of 3rd high peak in range of black hills, Two isolated white hills close together at 360° from stage give excellent observation post for all country round. A better observation post though not so easily attained is the first peak at X. end of black hills behind Patki and from this the route can be traced back to Pipli plateau and for some distance towards Chamag and also N ; to Kundi. Route is more or less in open plains except for first 3 miles in hills. Route rises for first mile then descends to 6£ miles and then practically flat to stage. Camping ground —Unlimited. Water .—Well of good water, but slightly stagnant taste At original level it holds about 54 cu: ft. of water and fills at the rate of about 8 gallons per minute. There is another well giving same amount of water as Patki, i.e., Chah-i-Mastian at 2 miles S.-E. of Patki. Fuel. —Abundant. Grazing. —Abundant. Supplies. —A' il.7 Route No. II (x)—conld. 3 CHAMAG ♦ . 16J m. General direction ( 6 , 010 ') S.-S.-W. Route bears N.-N.-W. for f mile then 45 m. turns W. round foot of Patki hills keeping alongside same hills to top of rise at SI- miles. A small isolated low range of hills is now seen in middle of plain (slightly to S.) and route passes on 8. side of these at 7 miles still keeping near original range. From first spur of these small hills, at 331° is Chah Mohamed distance 2] miles lying at foot of hills on N. side of plain (well of good but rather muddy water giving about 4 gallons per minute). Route then passes on S. side of small red isolated hill at 9i miles then turns S.-S.-W. to top of rise. Original range here proceeds to S. and route runs S.-S.-W. down to low isolated white hills straight in front in plain at 11 miles. From highest peak of these hills at 295° and 3 miles distant at foot of hills lies Maimud (spring of good water giving about 20 gallons per minute). Route then crosses large broad flat plain to Chamag. Several clearly defined tracks lead across to Chamag. A motor road could easily be made. Country all very open and flat. A small hill at stage gives good view of plain traversed but view to W. is blockedlby hills and to N.-N.-W. and S.-S.-W. by rolling hills. Route ascends steadily to 10 miles then descends slightly to 11 miles and after that ascends slightly across plain to stage. At one mile distant are three karezes of good and plentiful water Camping ground. —Unlimited. Water .—From a large Tcarez, yield about 60 gallons a minute, of excellent water. At 1 mile distance are 3 other karezea of good and plentiful water. Fuel. —Abundant. Grazing .—Plentiful camel grazing. Supplies. — Nil. 4 DUMAG .. 15 m. General direction torrent bed due W. and at 11 miles track is found clearly defined (4,915') S.-S.-W. Route leaves Chamag running down 60 m.8 Route No. II (x)— contd. on S. side of torrent bed. At 2 miles track leaves torrent bed running up side of same due S.-W. (£ mile before end of torrent bed opens into plain). Track then leads into plain over undulating ground keeping near rolling hills on S. side of track ; these hills then turn S. and track turns S.-S.-W. keeping near them over udulating ground. Hills then recede back to S.-E and track turns S. and keeps straight on over level ground. At 2|- miles from this point due W. lies Garunal (well of very good water filling at rate of 4 gallons per minute) just inside foot of hills on W. side of plain. Hills then veer round again to sharp peak which is seen S.-S.-E. and track still going S. passes round hills running out into plain at foot of this peak reaching last point of them at 12 miles. Track then dis appears and line must be taken at about 177° on to small isolated white hillock (clearly seen) passing through thick tamarisk jungle and alongside old ruined fort to stage. A motor road could easily be made. Camping ground. —Unlimited. Water. —Abundant, there being about ten wells of very good water. Fuel. —Abundant. Grazing .—Camel grazing abundant. At stage there is large expanse of grass land to S. and thick tamarisk jungle to N. Supplies .—Sheep and goats are obtainable. 5 GALUGAH .. 14J m. General direction S.-S.-W. Track leaves 74^ m. Dumag going S. across plain towards pass in low range which is reached at 4 miles and then enters and ascends torrent bed, bearing S.-W. reaches watershed at 5 miles. Track then disappears and route des cends in torrent bed and at 7 miles a spring of water slightly brackish giving 2 gallons per minute is passed. Route continues down torrent bed and at 9 miles pass opens out on to plain to (jalugah. A motor road could easily be made Small old fort at stage gives excellent view on all sides over plain. Grass and desert plain for first 4 miles, then barren torrent bed for 1 mile, then fertile torrent bed with tamariskRoute No. II (x)— concld. jungle and small quantity elephant grass.
