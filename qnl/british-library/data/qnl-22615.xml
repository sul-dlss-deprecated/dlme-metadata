Philby gave me in strict confidence the following aumraary of the position of Oil negotiations. 1 # The Minister of ^ureign Affairs* previous depends, which aimed priiaarily at obtaining substantial annual payments and a lump eum of one hundred thousand pounds down have been replaced by more onerous demands by King. The •Iraq concessions* terms have inspired the new demands, the chief difference being that Saudi Government now ask for promise of minimum royalty of two hundred thousand pounds on commencement of coiomercial exploitation as well as lump sum and animal payment. 2* At the moment the Iraq Petroleum Company are trying to ascertain what will be the minimum terms the Government will offer. They are unlikely to accept anything heavier than payment of lump sura and considerably lower annual payment than that demanded by Minister of Finance. Philby and I agree that there is possibility of business being transacted. 3. The Standard Oil of California^ representative returned from %ypt on April 9th. Before his departure he had made an offer of lump sura down and a considerably lower annual payment tnan tnat deinanded by Minister of Finance. He is/is however so disgusted with the latest Saudi proposals that| in view of the fact that his Principals show little eagerness to increase their offer, he refused to consider them and withdrew his earlier offer• 4. King, although still holding a low opinion of Holmes, has, in order to increase the field of competitors, agreed to his suggestion of a visit. Holmes claims that he is only bound to the Standard Oil of California in respect of concessions already obtained in the Persian Julf; you have, doubtless, full particulars of these. He gives Philby to understand that his immediate object is to obtain I bn Gaud 's consent, so far as the King is co-interested with the Shaikh of Kuwait, to concession in lleutral ^one and that he find Standard Oil of California have a mutual understanding that provided they do not interfere with his operations in Neutral ^one he will not interfere ?/ith them in Has a. Nevertheless Holmes had evolved schemes for Hasa, chief of which is to divide whole area into, say, 16 Blocks the big Oil Companies taking up sectionally as many as they wish and according to their holdings contributing payment approximating to the Minister of Finance''s demands. Phil by is of opinion that the Saudi an Government might accept such a plan but he doubts if Holmes, at present, has the backing to carry it through. Owing to lack of first-hand information and being unable to cross-question any one concerned the above is passed on with reserve. It is probable that King himself will direct negotiations which may enter latest stage of activities very shortly.

On the other hand, the undertaking which froro considerations of general policy we , ' ■ * gave to the Americans, commits us, as you know, to an attitude of impartiality as between the Ang^o—T^ersian Oil Gompanv and the American Group, who are competing for the concession through the Eastern and General Syndicate. P. I understand that in the course of the exhaustive xnteroepartinei; 1 al discussions with -^owle, when he was o^er heie, the Question what action we could, take in the circum stances to improve the prospects of the Kuwait concession going to an exclusively British Oompany was canvassed in all its aspects, and that ^owle knows what we think he can do in the matter within the above limits. ?• ®e agree of course that it would, be unfortunate that a bloc of predominantly foreign oil interests should be formed along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. But this appears inevitable in view of the facts (l) that under the Iraq -'etroleum Company Agreement, in the whole of Arabia with the execution of Kuwait and the ^arasn Islands, no component company of the Iraq Petroleum Company may take a concession without first offering it to the Iraq Petroleum Company, and (?) that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which is bound by that agreement, appears to be the only entirely British company interested in that part of the world. 4./ ^• G• Laithwai t e Esqui re ., ■ u« • -8- 4. I must confess that I c'o not see Y /hat no re can be done, unless there is any }io'ne of some exclusively British conpany, v;hich is not included in the Iraq Petroleum Gonpany, interest ing itself in the -^ersian Gulf area. 5.

From a brief study of the text, the absence of detaill in respect of the sums to be paid by the Company as a preliminary payment (Article 3), as rent (Article and also the lack of information regarding the exact area to be exploited are conspicuous and in a number of other particulars the text is, perhaps not unintentionally, vague.

'Hn.e tonnage ro^altv payable under the Agreement is 4/~ ^old (Article II) and on ^50,000 tons this would represent f. 150,000 per annum. ^he ra + e o^ rovaltv is the same as in Iraq. n n the establishment of commercial production another loan has to be made to the O-overnment and a ^ r ear later a further loan* Again no amounts are ment i oned. T T nder Article IP, if-the Company extracts, stores and sells any kind of mineral oil, a royaltv of l/8th of the revenue from sales is payable, niis provision is rather difficult to understand. If it is worth anything it ma^^ involve the Oonpan^ in substantial ■Daymen ts. r&gt; hey may possibly get over it by setting up subsidiary ^omnanies.

Mr.Miller wants to land an aeroplane at Bahrain on its way to Hasa and asked me what the position was about getting permission. I said that private aeroplanes were absolutely prohibited from landing in Bahrain and asked whether they could not fly direct to Hasa from Shai'bah instead of coming to Bahrain. I asked them to send me a letter putting their request m writing and explaining what was actually wanted. I said that the prohibition was primarily intended to keep ( out individual fliers but that if the Company wished to land I should have to place their request before the Political Resident and obtain the views of the Shaikh. I askea them to let me have a letter in time to send it across by the mail of the 30th Lecember. I specifically asked wnetner it was intended to use the plane for coming backwards and forwards between Bahrain and Kasa. Mr.Miller said that m cases of emergency/they might wish to do so but that primarily it would be used for exploration purposes. He/mentioned incidentally that they might wish to make Bahrain to some extent a base for their operations,which he added with a smile 'might bring a little profit to Bahrain as well'. The machine is to be a 'Fairchild No:VI',though they did not know what Nor'/l meant - probably some form of cabin machine. Mr.Miller askea about the position in Sa'udi Arabia and I said that the question of a plane entering Sa'udi Arabia was one for Bin Sa'ud to settle. I askeu whether the Company had got his permission and Mr.Miller said that he understood that it was being obtained. The plane will be shipped from America as soon as permits nave been arranged for its use.SH- 2. 3. Mr.Miller asked whether Mr.Russell had mentioned anything in the way about wireless communication between Bahrain and Sa T udi Arabia Stations. 1 said that he had asked me about it and that I understood that the matter was under consideration. I said that I had^no official knowledge but that I thought that the Sa f udi Arabia people had been in communication with the authorities at Berne. Mr.Miller emphasised the usefulness of the service and I agreed but saia that so lar as we were concerned the position was that the Sa'udi Arabia Stations ?f would not play tf . In this connection I mentioned the ? Kanno f forced landing at Jubail. Mr.Miller is going to write to me on this subject also. 4. I asked Mr.Miller in what capacity he proposed to write to me and he said that he was -Acting Manager of the fl outfit Tf . He will probably sign himself as Geologist-m-charge as e apparently he has not yet received the lull style of the new Company. Mr.Skinner emphasised that he had no connection with the Gompany T s business on the mainland (except that he naturally assisted them in various ways when necessary). 28-12-1933. lULJJ i.jjimi ''j a--'CONFIDENTIAL.

It can then proceed over Bin Saud's territory to Qatif, Ojair or; Hofuf, whichever destination is contemplated. Bin Saud, who is the authority con cerned, can make whatever arrangements are necessary for the flight. (2). I do not see why the aeroplane cannot he 'based on Q.atif, OJair, or Eofuf, where Bin Baud can make suitable arrangements. 4. With regard to lh), (1) His Majesty f s Government have laid great stress on allowing no exceptions to the rule that private aviators are not allowed to fly down the Arabian Ooast, and once we make an exception in favour of this aeroplane, we will have to allow it for all aeroplanes. (2) We have also laid stress on the same point when obtaining the necessary prohibition from the Shaikhs concerned, which we have only just received, and the Shaikhs wall certainly think it rather peculiar that we should suddenly turn round and ask them to go back on the orders which they have issued. 13) It seems to me that to alio?/ another American Company to establish their base in Bahrain is distinctly undesirable, and will lead to various complications./10$ Gomplioations. iror instance, having once got a footing of some sort on the Island for their aero planes, the Company will proceed to try and make it a regular 'base for all their operations.

Dated ^yth January ^3/ Your Express Letter iJ6-S January 20th. ihile I appreciate objections which you mention and should prefer in principle to have no loreign interests in Bahrain,there are certain local considerations of which I feel that you should be aware before coming to a decision. H. Mr.Miller (Geologist-in-charge in Hasa) mentionea recently in conversation the possibility of the Standard Oil Company of California wishing to use an aeroplane from Bahrain. I gathered that,though it would be used chiefly for exploration,aeroplane might be used for carrying personnel in case of sickness or emergency. This would,! think,be not unlikely to develop into a regular service. He said incidentally that they might wish to use Bahrain to some extent as a base,which,he added,might bring a little profit to Bahrain as well. They hope too that wireless communication bcfp—11u7s&amp;p (g.1254)-24-6-31—4,00,000. /will//3 2. will be established between tfte Imperial and International Communications Company Limited and the i3a'udi Arab stations. I asked him why they did not fly direct (1 gather tnat a safe landing ground,not too far oft and in touch with civilization, is their immediate object) and also said that they would neeu to get the sanction of the Sa'udi Arab Government for flying m Sa'udi Arabia. He said tnat he tnought that arrangements were being made to get the permission of the Sa'udi Arab Government for flying in Sa'udi Arabia and that he would write to me about the matter of Bahrsin,but did not do so. 3. Standard Oil Company of California are already m some sense based on Bahrain as their personnel land at Bahrain en route to Hasa and their imports are either lander and re-exported from,or transhipped at,Bahrain,which is a source of profit to the Bahrain Government. The Bahrain etroleuu Company,though technically a separate Company,helps the Standard Oil Company of California by putting up their men and malcing various shipping and other arrangements lor them. It would be difficult m practice to raise objections to the Standard Oil Company of California using the commercial tacilities of Bahrain. 4. if we place difficulties m the way of the Company getting facilities at Bahrain,it may encourage them to establish a main land port. b. it is true that the aeroplane now m question might be flown direct from 'ira-j. and be based tor fuelling on some place on the Ilasa Coast,but if the Company arrange to dump fuel (no doubt bought from the Anglo-^ersian Oil Company) on the Hasa Coast,there will be considerable incentive to Anglo-Persian Oil Company to arrange for Tanker 'Khuzistan' to call regularly at some mainland port (as she does now at ^atar),thereby depriving Bahrain oft transit dues. If they had to make arrangements for the aeroplane,the /Sa'udiuu 3 Sa'udi Arab G-overnment might be encouraged to arrange air facilities on tiieir coast. This might be useful to us m tne event of forced landings,but might prove troublesome m other ways. 5. I do not thinK that SnaiJch of Bahrain (or,indeed,others) would be surprised at being asked to make an exception in favour ol the Company's aeroplane,as it would have definite business purpose,which could not be achieveu by flying aown the Persian Coast, it would,of course,open the door to a similar request by the Anglo- T ersi8n Oil Company,but I gather this request is likely to be made,sooner or later,in any case. In the eyes of the Shaikh ol Bahrain the Bahrain ^etroleum Company and Standard Oil Company of California are one Company (as for practical purposes they are). 7. If the Standard Oil Company ol California were to have a regular base here,it migiit make it feasible for us to exercise more influence over them than woulu be possible if they were working from a base where we ourselves had less influence. 8. On the other hand,it may be diflicult to reluse them facilities at Kuwait (should we wish to do so),if tney are given facilities nere,and it may be expedient to remind the Company tnat they cannot have everything that they want on the Arab Littoral. On tne mlormation before me,! cannot offer any useful opinion on this aspect of the question. Lieut-Colonel Political Agent,Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 95-6 0ffftl92«.

As the itinerary of the aeroplane, as given in the American note, stops short at xiahrain. I asked the Embassy whether the Company were proposing to quarter their machine there or whether in fact it was going on to ciaudi-Arabia and would have its hase there. I took the opportunity to explain briefly the position in regard to private flights along the Arabian coast. Ihe Embassy promised to make enauiries and telephoned yesterday to say that, if possible, the Company would prefer to base their aeroplen on .bahrain, but as the Embassy have gathered from what I said xireviously to them that private flights are not permitted along the Arabian route, they understood that they may not be allowed to do so» They asked that we should state in our eventual reply to their note whether the Comnany would be allowed to use Bahrain or not.

S .32834 /S .6. dated 19th January,1934. 3834 /0 .6. 19th January, 1934. Sir. I am commandea by the Air Council to reply to Foreign Office letter (E.150/150/91) of the 6th January, 1934, forwarding a copy of a despatch from the United States L-l Charge d'Affaires? concerning a proposed survey of the region comprised in its oil concession in Eastern Arabia by the California Arabian standard Oil Company. For reasons of which ? ecretary ir John imon is aware (vide M ,E.(M) 15) the Air Council are strongly opposed to the authorisation of flights by private aircraft along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf until the route is further developed; in the circumstances of the present proposal, however, as it appears that the Company do not propose to make any flights beyond Bahrein, they do not desire to raise any objection to application being made through the appropriate channel to the Bheikhs of {oweit and Bahrein for the necessary authorisations to be issued. ir John Simon has recently referred to the difficulties arising in connection with | flights near the Hasa Coast (vide Foreign Office letter I E.5454/78/28 of 6th Kovember, 1933) but the Council understand that the Saudi authorities have already granted permission for the Company to operate aircraft in Hasa territory. The/ der- ecretary of tate, foreign Office, ^owning ire t, .''.1. \The Council would, be glad to be placed in possension of any further information which &gt;ir John iraon may receive regarding the oil concession referred to in the letter under reply and in particular to receive confirmation that the California Arabian tandard Oil Company do not in fact contemplate undertaking flights beyond Bahrein as the objections to flights by private civil aircraft over Qatar and along the Trucial coast are much more serious than in respect of that section of the route which lies between Basra and Bahrein. In this connection it is pointed out that, in the event of civil aircraft getting into difficulties as the result of a forced landing, our political and air authorities would inevitably have to render assistance. The Council have no objection to the use which it is understood the Company desire to make of the civil aerodrome at Muharraq, and they suggest that the Company should be advised to apply direct to Imperial drways Ltd., concerning the details of any charges which may arise in addition to landing fees etc., as laid down by the Sheikh of Bahrein.

Agents in Bahrein ana Koweit. I askea to say that now that we have received tills fuller statement from Fowls we agree entirely with him on bo ui points and that we suggest that in the c 1 rcxansteuacee ohe answer to the Embassy on the question of permission to ily over Bahrein and Koweit should be in the sense of &gt;' Paragraphs 1 ana hof his telegram, i.e. that the prohibitid; is absolute: ana that for the reasons given in paragraph 2 xlight ov«r Koweit is unnecessary. It may be unnecessary now to make any reference to the question of base at Bahrein, since we understand that the Company no longer regard it as eosentlal, ouu in our view the arguments against agreeing to it stated in paragraphs 3 ana 4 of Fowle's telegram (particularly in the light of the information, for what it is worth, recently given by Holmes as to the activities of the Bahrein Petroleum Company on behalf of the standard Oil) are in any case very strong.

In July, 1935, the Standard Oil Company of California obtained from King Ibn Saud an^ oil concession, covering the eastern portion of Saudi Arbaia. x he i'ext of an agreement between the ..Saudi Ciovernment and the Company was published in the official ^Umm~e 1 -Q,ura 1 *, of the 14th July, but certain important particulars, including the exact area covered by the c( concession were not specified in it and were apparently reserved for a second ^special agreement'* which has not been made public. A translation is at present being prepared ana a copy will be communicated to the Ministry as soon as it is available. It will be seen that Article 19 of this agreement contemplates the possibility of permission being granted to the Company to employ aircraft within the limits of ^audi Arabia, subject to a. separate agreement with the Saudi Government on this subject# *'rom the present application by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (which is no doubt a subsidiary of the Company/ : I A he Secretary of the Air Minsitry. u '''f 1 'M'S Company holding the concession) for permission to send out an/aeroplane to LI Hasa along the Arabie.n coast air KKJOiiax route, it woula appear that they have reached a settlement with the Saudi (iovernment on this point, 3» The secretary of Stgi^e' concurs in the views expressed by uhe Aii Council that it is undesirable that the Company's aircraft should be allowed to fly over Qatar and the Trucial Coast # This point has also been raised by the India Office (see paragrd.ph 2 of telegram .No# 102 oi the 12th January from the Secretary of Stare for India to the Government of Indip a copy of which was enclosed in India Ofiice letter i^o.P.^.245/ 34 of the 15th Janaury to the foreign Office and Air Ministry) and it will be borne/ in mind in replying to the United States Embassy• 4» A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office# I am f ^ir, Your obedient Servant, [ Sd) Gr. *V.

In the case of Xoweit and Bahrein, however, 1 regret to inform you that general regulations, made by the rulers of those two principalities, prohibit entirely all flights by civil aircraft except those of aviation companies which have received or may receive perraission to include these places on regular flying services. A strict prohibition of this kind has been found necessary in view of local conditions; the utmost importance la attached to meintalaing it intact and no exceptions are made even in the case of British aviators. I m however glad to think that the facilities sought by the company in respect of Koweit &amp;nd Bahrein are not essential, since it should be possible for the company's aircraft to reach Saudi Arabia from Basra without flying over Koweiti territory or territorial waters, uid to proceed direct to some convenient place in Oeudi territory where it Is to operate, such/ Atherton, Esq., etc., eto., y etc ♦ 9Ibf ♦tli 1 i sucli as tuts Island of Tarut, which Is included In its itinermp as given in your note.

With regard to the warning to the Agent of Imperial Airways you suggest^ I think the best course to adopt would be for you to have a talk with Russell when you get back to Bahrain. By the time that the aeroplane makes its first emergency visit to Bahrain presumably the Civil Air Agreement will.have been signed by the Shaikh and charges etc#, will be fixed under that agreement# If by any chance the machine makes a visit before then charges could be made after discussion between you and Russell. 4# With reference to your paragraph 2, for reasons given I would prefer not to raise the question with Imperial Airways in London. ~7 ' - c - utenant Colonel Gordon Loch, I#A# r Political Agent.

He said that they had now decided to commence drilling operations, probably early in January, at Dhahran, a point on the mainland opposite to Bahrain. i^hilst this was the only place at which they proposed to drill at present, their geologists were busy pursuing their examina tion of the area of the concession. they were working in four parties and were now, he understood, in northern Hasa in the neighbourhood of As-Saffa. They were making good use of their aeroplane, which they had found invaluable, 2. Mr .Lenahan proceeded to say that they had also come to a satisfactory arrangement with the Saudi authorities over the use of wireless telegraphy- He quoted that part 01 Article 19 of their concession which confers on the Company the righ€ to use n all means of communication', and asked ,, • niWWtm:;•&amp;£J®*-' that he had experienced considerable difficulty in persuading the Saudi Arab Government to see aye to eye in the inter pretation of this. Now that this difficulty had been overcome, they proposed to make full use oi wireless telegraphy in their operations. Jubail would be their centre in Hasa, and I understood, hxm to say that other points in the field of their concession, where their Right Honourable representatives / Sir John Simon,G.C.S.l•,etc., etc., etc.2- representatives were at work would be suitably equipped* He appeared to consider it possible that his office in Jedda would, in time if not in the near future, be similarly furnished. I alluded to the expert staff he would require if he were to have a transmitting set here, to which he replied that he thought the apparatus would be of a compara tively simple type. These wireless sets were now being made, especially for his Company, in the United States. 3.
