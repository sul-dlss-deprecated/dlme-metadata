CONFIDENTIAL I forward herewith some notes prepared hy I eikle on a visit he paid to Dhahran on the 26th-27th November. 2. Tne following information was given me orally by Leikle who has paid another visit to Dhahran since his notes were recorded (a) The local representative of the ministry of Finance, Shaikh Abdullah bin Adnan, told him quite openly that Ibn Saud was more or less finished. (b) He is having increasing difficulty in obtaining visas for his employees who, it is intended, should reside on the mainland. One, Captain ..ilne, has been v/aiting in Bahrain for a month for a visa. Gray Mackenzies* Senior Representative on the mainland., Blackmore, applies for visas to the Amir at Dammam. Visas for a visit of a few days duration are given readily and with little delay, but applications for visas for more or less permanent residence have to be referred to Jeddah and it is weeks before replies are received. (c) There is a steady increase of the U.S.A.A.F. build-up at Dhahran. Gray Mackenzies recently delivered 500 tons of cement and 300 tons of other cargo and very much bigger consignments are expected in the near future. Ara.-co have now ceased using the jetty at A1 Khobar and the U.S.A.A.F. have been enquiring from them about ifc capacity. They were referred by Aramco to Gray :,.ackenzies. (d) Aramco are now operating the new field at Ain His Excellency A. 0. Trott, Esq., C.-.G., O.B.E., H. M*s Ambassador, Jeddah. /Dar2 (.?) Dar, 23 miles west of AlaqaiQ. and also a field called A1 Harara somewhere in the vicinity. They are drilling wells in the sea bed off Saf/aniyah, south of i isliab. He says that at this site there is the bi ,gest dome in the whole of Arabia. (e) There is a complete change in tne demeanour of American personnel at Dhahran and in the whole atmosphere there. All food now has to be paid for and as a result a cup of coffee is being ordered instead of a large steah. There is also less demand from housewives for furniture as rent has to be paid for every article. (f) Bosv/orth is now running two scheduled services between Bahrain and Dhahran daily. No more Aramco launches are running between Manamah and A1 Khobar but the l.ercury Boat Line is operating. (g) The Kanoos have obtained permission to open an office on the mainland, and in consequence, Gray Lackenzies are transferring to them their agency for the Dutch Lines with effect from the 1st January, 1951* 3 . 1 was informed by another source a week or two ago that an American had been in prison for 60 days without trial for running over a man saying his prayers. The local author ities say that the matter was so obvious that no trial was necessary.Kotes on visit to Dhahran ~ 26tli/27tli Noveiaber, 1950# I called upon Lr* Duncan in cnarge of P. &amp; S # where I niet Mr. Stepney, his Assistant manager, and had a general discussion wher A I endeavoured to elicit some information as to the future tonnages likely to he coming forward and also what their lighterage requirements are likely to he, hut I could get very little iniormation. r. Duncan s;^oke of the difficulty they are now experiencing with Saudi Customs at Dammam and showed me the translation of a recent letter dated 16th November, 1950 from the Directorate of nasa Customs wherein they state that in future they require a harge manifest well in advance giving particulars of all cargo lightered from ships at Daflii«am to Has Tanura. This of course is quite imposs ible as we cannot state beforehand in which particular craft the cargo ie to he lightered to Has Tanuar will he barged. This can only he ascertained as and when the barges are loaded alongside the snip and in respect of which documentation has been provided hiinserto in the shape of CA.17s. I also called on r. Mackenzie who has taken r, Webster*s place te. *porarily, the latter now being in : ishab where he is taking over from Tapline, who will now disappear from that area. hr. i ackenzie showed me a letter from Lloyds Agents at Lanrain asking for particulars of the •. orth Pier at Has Tanura which infonaation is required by Lloyds. Mr. J ackenzie said that they are not permitted to give us this information but showed me a copy of their letter to i r. H.j. Thompson who is in charge of Public relations, lew York, and who lias b en asked to supply the particulars. With r. Fraser, Claims Arbitrator, I visited Dammam where I called on hr. Gildae and Capt. Labb(the latter has replaced Capt. Allan). They are all very concerned at the attitude of the Saudi Customs which is causing tremendous delays on all sides. Mr. Fraser informs me that Customs are insisting on checks at the ship’s side and again at Dammam, and that they require each mark to be accounted for separately. Aramco have five main destinations to which their cargo goes forward and it appears that the ship will be used as a /sorting depotV/ . ? • • ♦ • •opinion that AraiLOO Management mast realise that if ships cannot depend on receiving reasonable despatch at the port of Daninam, ship-owners are bound to recoiiipense themselves for the cost of such delays at the expense of consignees. To me it appears that much of the trouble with Customs is due to tlie fact that no one seems to know just what they are trying to do. There is no proper system or organisation, regulations are continually being changed and even junior customs officials may suddenly give new orders which must be carried out. Ara »eo seem to be in a very weak position which they, to a large extent, have brought on themselves. Although it was well-known that the importation of certain articles was strictly prohibited, nevertheless the Customs on occasional spot checks would con tinually find s ch items in personnel efx^ects, so now the Customs insist on opening every package - even Company’s stores - and Aramco do not appear to be in a position to raise any objection. (Mr. eraser’s own person* effects have been lying in the Customs for the past five weeks and he still does not know when he will receive them.) This of course causes further delay, not to mention expense and amnoyance to Ara^co, as delicate instruments are ill treated and exposed to sand have to be reconditioned. I explained that although my visit was primarily a courtesy one on my return from leave, I did want to try to find out, if at all possible, what the future is likely to hold for us particularly in regard to tonnages coming forward and to viiat extent we would be required to provide lighterage. Mr. Duncan had mentioned 48fOOC tons as expected during November, December, January and l r. CundalM said that he thought 20/j of their cargo would require to be barged back to Pas Tanura. He said that their supplies were roughly divided 50/o to Dhahran and 25^ each to Abqaiq and to Has Tanura, but that part of the Has Tauura stores would be channelled through Dhahran. This would part icularly apply to reefer cargo, such as fresh meat, when the railways have their refrigerated cars operating in January. (from Dhahran such cargo would go by road to Has Tanura.) I \ /could- 4 - 8 (£&gt; I could obtain no infomation of any likelihood to lighterage being required to any other discharge point, and when I asked Mr. Duncan point blank if all their cargo would go over Daiaaaia pier - except that for Ras Tanura - he said that they would not wish it to be routed otherwise. I aksed if in view of the delays being experienced with Customs at Dammam it might not be considered desirable to barge some cargo to A1 Khobar and he replied that the;/ definitely do not want to reopen Al Ahobar since they have not now got the necessary organisation - neither personnel nor trucks. I was really trying to find out if the development of a new oil field would not call for lighterage to sorae other discharging point but I could get no infomation at all, although I have heard talk of a new field to be opened about 40 miles west of Abqtaiq. and of possible developments off-shore from Suffaniya* (There are still no signs of the new field at Abu Hadriyeh being opened). If operations are developed off shore in the Suffaniya area - which I believe will be the case - then presumably Mishab will be used as the port of discharge in which case lighterage craft will be necessary. Test holes have already been drilled with most favourable results; the dome there is said to be one of the bi igest in Arabia. I mentioned the probability of our having to build one or perhaps two houses at Dammam for our jSuropean staff and I said that I understand that houses for Americans may be built at Dammam in the near future. Mr. fund all recommended that I discuss this matter with hr. Gildae who is just about to place an order v/ith a local contractor for 50 houes. *1 shall be giving this matter further attention shortly. Generally I got the impression that the retrenchment phase has passed and that now the pendulum is swinging the other way. The price of crude has advanced recently, and the economy campaign seems to have b en forgotten for the dmfoent. Commercial cargo is now coming in through Dammam, the U.S. Army to.mages are steadily increasing and they say will continue to increase.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002aa_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/475</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002aa</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/475</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'DAMMAM DHAHRAN PROJECT'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1946/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-06-09T13:37:59</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (11 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.
