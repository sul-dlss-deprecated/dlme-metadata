The letter outlines four options for how the British may best handle the current political situation in Aden, a British Protectorate. Attached to the letter are two enclosures which largely support Walton's ideas. The first enclosure is written by Colonel Robert Alexander Wauhope, Political and Military Intelligence Officer, Aden, and details the history of 'The Boundary of the Aden Protectorate'. The second enclosure is written by Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Fenton Jacob, First Assistant Resident, Aden, and provides information on 'A Political Policy in our Hinterland'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>First Assistant Resident, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign Secretary</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>General Officer Commanding, Aden Field Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political and Military Intelligence Officer, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Protectorates</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sailing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundary disputes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000259#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
