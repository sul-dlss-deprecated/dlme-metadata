The file covers some of the consequences resulting from the failure to reach an agreement on this issue.Much of the rest of the file focuses on various proposals for providing assistance to the Hejaz (later Saudi) Government such as: the provision of a British Air Mission, the appointment of a Muslim Air Adviser (from either Egypt, Iraq, or India), the supply of aircraft and equipment, and various suggestions for training pilots and mechanics at Royal Air Force institutions. These proposals are discussed in terms of their practicality, and their financial and political feasibility.The file also contains some discussion related to the following: a proposal from Misr Airwork for a demonstration of the Avro 626 to the Hejaz Government; a Turkish military mission in Saudi Arabia; an Italian Air Mission to Saudi Arabia; and a proposal to supply arms and ammunition to Saudi Arabia. It also has extracts from
                           The Timesnewspaper dated 27 April 1933 (folio 143) and 12 February 1937 (folio 124);
                           The Evening Standarddated 25 November 1931 (folio 207); and an extract from the
                           Umm-al-Quradated 16 September 1932 (folio 151).The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jeddah (Andrew Ryan and Reader William Bullard), HM Chargé d’Affaires at Jeddah (Cecil Gervase Hope-Gill), officials at the Air Ministry, and officials at the Foreign Office. Much of the file consists of correspondence forwarded from the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Under-Secretary of State for India, in order to inform India Office officials of developments in Arabia.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Pilots</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001e8#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
