No.44. f ’'••'..ij;' Po'-itical Agency, Kuwait. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush i re. Letters from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz al Baud to His Excellency the shaikh of Kuwait. I have the honour to enclose for your inform ation translation of a letter No.865, dated the 14th Shawwal 1351( 9.2.33.) to-gether with two Mulhaqs, which His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait .received from His Majesty the Ling of Sa t udiyah on 19th Eebruaiy 1935. 2. The letter was brought by the King’s most confidential emissary one Abdul Aziz al Riba’ai a man never employed unless there is work of a special nature 3. Al Ribai left Kuwait again for Riath on 26th 4. After receipt of the King’s letter His Excel lency the Shaikh made two long and mysterious car jouneys to go on at present, I rather suspect they were mde as a result of a secret and verbal message which Al Ribai delivered to the Shaikh. -he first journey was made on the early morning Prom H*/ ■.(. Dated the 5th March 1933. gut ^ Lt.-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To Sir, afoot. February, and during his stay did not come near the Agen qy , although I know him well. Tar to the south, and allhough I have nothing definite of 20th February. The Shaikh only returning late at night/nig^it on the 23rd of February. The second .journey was made in a violent dust storm on 25th February, the Shaikh returning on the 27th February again late at night. 6. The Shaikh admitted to me on 2nd March that he reached Khabari Wadha (120 miles) on the first journey returning by the same route; and on his second trip got as far as a point slightly south east of Safa (150 miles) and. said that he could see the Suraman escarpment in front of him. His Sccellency was insistent that he had only gone to hunt gazelle and hubara, taking advan tage of the lovely Spring weather which we are having now. 7« The ohaikh took with him on each occasion the following persons:- (a) Shaikh Abdulla al Salim (1st cousin); (b) shaikh Salman al Kamud (2nd cousin); (c) Shaikh Ali al Khalifa (2nd cousin); (d) His sen Mohamed; (e) Yusuf al Salim, brother of Abdul Aziz al Salim, his Basrah Agent; (f) Maj or Holmes Confidential Agent, Mohamed Yatim. 6. Incidentally Ihe Shaikh never takes members of his family with him when out hunting, and conversely only does so if engaged on an important mission,as for instance, when he went to Riath in April 1S62. 9. .-j.nother curious feature about these two jour neys was the fact that on 20th Februaiy the Shaikh was to have dined with Mr.Chisholm of the Anglo Persian Oil company and Shaikh ^bdullah as-Salim with me. Both din ner parties were 'cut* without any apology or note giving reasons - an unheard of thing where these two very punc tilious Shaikhs are concerned. 10, I, myself, toured the Southern frontier from 24th to 27th - the period of the Shaikh’s second ’dash’15 ./ 3 5 ( 5 ) ’dash* into the desert, and I gathered from Ifen Jama, the paramount ohaikh of the Awazim, whom I met, that Ibn Jaloui arid His Majesty King Abdul Aziz had arranged to meet in the Summan area (Mutair Country to the im mediate south of Safa) somewhere about the end of Feb ruary and that he (Ibn Jama) had got this from Ibn Jaloui himself on the 14th February in Hoffuf. 11. In view of the above facts, I have a shrewd suspicion - thcush I say this most guardedly - that the Shaikh went to meet the King by prearranged agreement; that he failed on his first journey, came back for more petrol and did actually meet him on the 25th or 26th Feb ruary. $2. If the above meeting did actually take place one may, I think, justifiably conclude that two things were discussed. (a) Din Baud's desperate need for money; (b) Oil Question. Under (a) it is not entirely beyond the bounds of possibility that he asked for a loan and in return offered some relief from the 'Blockade*. If (b) was discussed -also with the intention of getting money - the presence of Mohamed Yatim, Major Holmes's emissary with the Shaikh's party is significant. 13. All car-drivers, personnel etc., who accompanied the Shaikh’s party seem averse to talking, and appear to be bound to secrecy, but the truth will doubtless come out before long. 14. I report the above - rather interesting facts for your information, as they possibly presage some interesting move in the near future on thepart of the Shaikh or the King15 . On the othor hand I may be all wrong in my surmises and repeat that what I have said must be taken with caution. 4 I have the honour to be, sir, Your most obedient servant, \ Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.

A --0O0 After Compliments. Your letters have, lately, been coming to us after such long intervals that we have thought fit to send our servant Al Rubai with this our letter, so as to keep this accustomed practice uninterrupted, and to inform you that you are always in our mind, as well as, to enquire about your precious health. Please do not fail to write regularly to us, giving us news of your good self and letting us know if anything be required by you. are We, ourselves,/by the grace of God, in the best of health and happiness, and the news of our side is that matters are going on smoothly in all directions.

BrotherI. May Ood save you. * iis regards the promise which I made to you last year I, your brother, favoured the idea greatly ana was getting myself ready, when thisYaman business intruded which, of course, you are aware of. In consequence it became necessary to teach the country and its population. Furthermore, the treaty which was formerly con cluded between us and Yahya regarding frontier matters is about to come t o an end and negotiations (fresh) are engaging our minds constantly. We also had careful cal culations made of the distance between Kuwait and Riath in order to find out if the travelling motor wireless set rihioh we hove got, could maintain comm nication with the capital but withait success. ith these points in view, and as the benefit affects both of us and our keeping constant communication is most essential, I write this letter asking to be excused from proposed visit which I shall propose again either this stirrer or next year. It v/ould give us groat pleasure if we cculd get the pleasing news that you were proceeding for Lews pilgriitage this year, other things, which we^heve been confided to your (our) servant Al Rubai, who will dis close them to you. oOo * To visit Kuwait in the Winter or Spring of 19S2/SS.Translation of I^ulhac^ No*2 to l0tt9r No»86o, datod 14th Shauwal 1351 (.9.2.33.), from His I'^ajesty King Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman, al Faisal, to His Excellency ohaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Eabah, K.C.X.E*, O.S.X., Ruler of Kuwait. O0O' BrotherI Uay God save you. We are pleased to send Al Rubai to make en quiries about your health and to convey to you the good news that God has graciously conferred upon the Muslims by the putting down of this seditious rebellion. The Xdrisi and all those who were with him, and the Thole country and population under the Idrisi was over-run by the Muslims, to whom the whole population sur rendered. The people are now tranquil and quiet. Thanks be to God for same. Only the Idrisi with a few persons escaped to Yahya’s territory. But correspondence bet ween us and the latter is now going on, as the treaty concluded between us ani him provides that criminals should be handed over. In fact Yahya, may God well reward him, did what he ought to do; he remained neutral in this rebel lion, and has now asked us for an amnesty for all re fugees including the Idrisi. This question is not an easy one to decide in view of what happened to our army under Ibn Luwai^ and others with him? As to Ibn Musa 1 ad and his relieving armies: these were dispatched as a precautionary measure. They duly reached (.asir) where they found the remnants of those who had stirred up the rebellion hiding themselves in the mountains. Some of these were killed and some captured. The country is now being administered by Ibn Musa*ad and the committee which accompanied him. TQ&amp;y also are negotiating the conclusion of the frontier treaty with Yahya and are reconciling certain tribes of Najra^n at/- 2 - Najran at feud with each other. Thanks to God, all matters turned out as we wished them to do. As both of us are concerned and will rejoice at this, we decided to send you the good news. 0O0 *This refers to the defeat and death of Ehalid ibn Luvai, and his son Saad.CONFIDENTIAL.

I gather from very confidential conversation with Philby that position of oil negotiations is more or less as follows. King has evolved demands even more onerous than those previously propounded by Minister for Foreign Affairs who was aiming primarily at getting lump sum of one hundred thousand pounds down and substantial annual payments. New demands are inspired by terms of * Iraq concessions. Main feature appears that Saudi Government now want not only lump sum down and annual payment but promise of minimum royalty of two hundred thousand confining themselves for the moment to attempts to ascerts,in the minimum terms which Government will offer. They might rise to payment of lump sum and annual payment much lower than those demanded by the Minister of Finance but not more. Philby shares my view that they are unlikely to do business. returned from Egypt on 9th April, he had offered before departure lump sum and annual payment, although to amount far short of demands of Minister of Finance. His Principals are not keen on any great increase in offer and he is so disgusted at the latest Saudi proposals that he has refused to entertain them and has also withdrawn his previous offer. pounds once commercial exploitation begins. 2 . ♦Iraq Petroleum Company representatives are Representative of the Standard Oil oi California V4 King still nas a low opinion ol Holmes but acceded to nis suggestion or a visit in order to enlarge the field of competitors. Holmes represents nimself as being tied t , standard Oil or California only in respect of concessions already obtained in tne Persian Gulf, or which you doubtless nave full particulars. «e tells Pnilby that his immediate purpose is to get ttie consent of Ibn Saud so far as Jne xs co- interested with Shaikh of Kuwait to concession in the heutral gene and tnat he has gentleman* s agreement with the Standard Oil of California not to queer tneir pitch in Haea provided tnat they leave him free hand in regard to the heutral hone. D# Permitted Holmes nas evolved schemes for Hasa ^ principle of which would be to divide the whole of tne area into say 16 Blocks which might be taken up sectionally by the big oil companies each taking as many as suited it and contributing proportionately to payment approximating to the demands of tne Minister of Finance. Pnilby thinks seme such scheme might be acceptable to the Government but does not believe that Holmes nas at present serious backing lor it* I pass on above with reserve, as I Have not first-hand information of value and cannot cross-question any one concerned.

Re added he was ntot in the slightest hurry to p rrivo at a settlement which inclines me to believe that he is now waiting to see what Bin Saud does. In my opinion Shaikh more than ever favourable to Holmes who, there is little doubt, went to Jedda to negotiate separate concession(s) for Neutral Kone with the concurrence af and approval of the Shaikh. Bin Saud apparently has not decided anything yet but should (_be\ __ succeed in his object his chances of getting Kuwait concession will clearly be greatly increased.

It may he worth observing that it is, in my opinion, unlikely that Ihn Sa’M can have gone to meet the Sheykh of Kuwait in February, though it would perhaps have been possible for him to do so quietly, as he seems to have been in camp at Rawdat-al-Khafs for some weeks before March 19. I think there is more plausibility in the suggestion that the Sheykh may have met some personage in the icing’s entourage. His Majesty’s cousin and brother-in-law, Sa’ftd al ’Arafa, appears to be close to His Majesty and may be in his confidence for certain purposes. ) 2. In the course of recent general conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza, I cited, as an example of Ibn Sa’ftd’s unreadiness to do as much as he might to please His Majesty’s Government, his action in trying to throttle Kuwait. Fuad Bey reacted with words which suggested that relations between this country and Kuwait were no concern of ours, to which I retorted that we had a special position in regard to Kuwait, a contention which Fuad Bey admitted. This conversation was in no sense a serious discussion; indeed it was almost persiflage, which I had no reason to record but which may be of some interest in the present connexion. /3. Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BushireifO 3.

I had heard of possible non-British European competitors including, I think, Breach, hut only in araguest terms. f'&lt; i-V- I think that in report quoted in preceding paragraph Dickson underestimates affect of King’s dislike of Holmes. It is increasingly probable that latter came here in April with primary object of securing Ihn Saud’s assent to concession in Kuwait Heutral Zone and found that there was nothing doing in that direction. He may also have discovered, however, that he was not jiersqna gratis, for any purpose except apparently enlargement of field Ox competitors for Hasa concession. This might explain his rapid departure at moment ■when King was expected to visit Jedda within a few days. These considerations may have a hearing on future developments in connection with Kuwait and Heutra^- Zone concessions if there is any foundation for Dickson’s surmise that Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn Saud have been exchanging views about oil. King perhaps hopes one day toreduce Kuwait to poeition of Me vassal. He might well wish therefore to influence Shaikh's policy in a sense adverse to Anglo-Persian Oil Company hut not necessarily favourable to Holmes. Kight he not prefer to see Standard Oil Company of California, who are already in Bahrain and have now got concession for Hasa Coast, cut out all present candidates for Kuwait and Neutral Zone including Eastern Gulf, to thich Holmes is committed in respect of these two areas? This is of course mere conjecture as i do not know whether Standard Oil Company of California would themselves wish to enter further areas in question* - BYANCONFIDENTIAL.

He said 'I do not like that man; and what is he doing here anyhow?' And they said 'Your Majesty asked him to come here”. And the King replied that he was damned if he had,and that he wanted to see the file; and the King was very angry so he said 'Well - if H does not go away at once,I will put him in prison because he has owad me £.3,000 for a very long time and has never paid it'. Then the man went away quickly. And then they found on the file that the King had sent a telegram asking him to come,but that it ha^ been issued by one of the Ministers.

The decree, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, appeared unaccompanied by the terms of the concession, but announced that an agreement would in fact shortly be published and alluded to a “ special agreement,” which was also to be brought into force. 2. The Umvi-al-Qura duly published, in two instalments, in its issues of the 14th and 21st July, the terms of the concession, a document of thirty-three articles, a translation of which I enclose herewith. The concession is to come into force as from the 7th July, 1933, and active operations are contemplated before the end of September 1933. 3. From a brief study of the text, the absence of details in respect of the sums to be paid by the Company as a preliminary payment (article 3), as rent (article 4), and also the lack of information regarding the exact area to be exploited, are conspicuous, and in a number of other particulars the text is r perhaps not unintentionally, vague. The “ special agreement,” to which allusion is made in the decree, must therefore contain these interesting items of information, which the parties to the agreement intend, it would appear, should not be divulged. 4. A copy of this despatch and enclosures are being sent to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

All the places (areas) which are given up by the Company will be released from the restrictions and conditions of this agreement, but the Company will have the permanent right to employ those areas for the purposes of transport and communications during the duration of this agreement, provided that this practice should have a slight connexion only with the other form or method in which these parts (areas) surrendered by the Company can be used. Article 7. The Company should begin with the operations of digging as soon as it (the Company) discovers the place suitable for the same, and, in any case, if the Company fails to proceed with the operations of digging within a period of three years as from the end of September 1933 (subject to the observation of the provisions of article 24 of this agreement), the Government may then terminate this agreement. Whenever the Company begins with the operations of digging, it should persevere with energy until it discovers oil in commercial quantities or until it terminates this agreement, and if the Company fails to give notice regarding the date on which oil is discovered, then the date to be fixed for this purpose will be counted as from the date on which the Company completed the digging of one well or wells, examines them and discovers that they can supply not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil daily and for a period of thirty days consecutively in conformity with the reliable practice observed in first-class oil fields. The operations of digging include the ordering of tools and other machines and their shipment to Saudi Arabia, and also include the preparation of roads, camps, buildings, fittings, transport, communications and fitting machines and other means for well-digging. Article 8. Immediately after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities the Company should give the Government the loan already agreed upon, and after one year another loan should be given to the Government. The date of paying the first loan will be the date on which oil is discovered in commercial quantities as provided for in this agreement, and the date of offering the second loan will be after one year from that date, and in both cases the Government will grant the Company a period of sixty days’ delay so as to enable it to pay the loan during - that period. Article 9. As it has been agreed that the annual rent will be paid up to the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities, and as it has also been agreed that the annual rent should be paid in advance, therefore it is possible that the last payment of the annual rent before the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities mav include a certain period after the date on which the oil is discovered, and if this extra period is equal to one-fifth of the year or more, the amount proportionate to that period will be considered as a loan due by the Government. [879 q—5] b 24 Article 10. As soon as it becomes possible (i.e .,the Company will be allowed a reasonable im ± Vi5 orc , e ] rin ^ additional tools and for their shipment to Saudi Arabia to mee the additional work after the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities) the Company should continue digging, by means of two digging machines, till it completes digging all over the fixed zone, in conformity with the practice observed in first-class oil-fields, or until this agreement expires.

If this first payment is not paid in gold it may be paid in pounds sterling at the rate of exchange at the time the Company pays the said payment to the correspondent of the bank. Article 16. After discovering oil in commercial quantities within a reasonable period, the Company may choose a place in Saudi Arabia for the purpose of establishing a factory for manufacturing a sufficient quantity of petrol and kerosene to suffice the needs of the Government.

Section 1. Mr. Calvert to Sir John Simon.—{Received September 12.) (No. 268.) Jedda, August ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 235 of the 25th July last, relative to the fprms of the Hasa Oil Concession gr anted -hy- -the Saudi Arab Government to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have the honour to report that certain rumours which ha'dbeen circulating in Jedda during the past few weeks regarding the payment of the first large sum as a loan to the Government proved in the main to be correct with the arrival on the 20th August of the sum of £35,000 gold in English sovereigns. The 'specie was' not, however, landed here owing to some deficiency Tn the shipping documents, but remained on board the Khedivial steamer, the Talodi, and left with her again the same day for Port Sudan, whence she is due to return to-day. I understand that shipping arrangements were made in London through the Haines Line, by one of whose ships the money was brought to Suez, where it was transhipped into the Khedivial steamer for Jedda. The documents, instead of being sent to the Dutch bank here who are charged with the handling of the money, were addressed to the local ao-ent of the Blue Funnel Line, and were received by him too late for the £3o,00U gold to be landed at the first visit. It will be landed to-day. 2 That this large sum of money, amounting to over £50,000 sterling at present rates, is only a loan has been confidently asserted by persons who claim to have received their information direct from those concerned on behalt of the company, and the repayment, it is further stated, is to be made gradually against the eventual royalties received by the Saudi Arab Government. This^ arrange- mein7it~ctnTectly stated, would therefore be provided for in the special agree ment,” the terms of which have not so far been disclosed. 3. Mr. K. Twitched, who, in the continued absence of Mr. Hamilton, repre sents the company here, states that he intends to leave Jedda about the 28th August for the Hasa coast by car. He has been away from the 1st August on a short tour of inspection, on behalf of the Saudi Government, of the old gold mines in the Hejaz, which it is believed are by no means worked out, and returned unannounced on the 14th August, to prepare for the arrival ot t e company’s consignment of specie to the Saudi Government. , 4. It is stated here that active ope rations are. contemplated by the Standard Oil Company of California within the next few weeks, and that oil mining gear is already well on its way to the Hasa coast by way of the Persian Gulf. 5.

(A) —Petroleum Prospects of Arabia. (1) LITTORAL Region of the Hejaz .—Petroliferous deposits and seepage have long been known to exist in this area. Interest m it ^ Mr Twitchell’s survey in 1931 in the coastal region north of Jedda, but tn area seems to have dropped into the background of late. In a report furnished hv the Anelo-Persian Oil Company to the Petroleum Department in 1932, it wls pointed out that the general structure of the Red Sea is k ^fJ g ® 0 i t °f^ ults y as a “ Rift Valley,” that is, a sunken valley bounded on either side by rift faults. The prospects of finding oil in commercial quantity are consideredtoberemote, though not entirely non-existent, and even after a complete survey Rift Valle\ conditions ” are such that any test drilling would be very specu ative. (2) Hasaand Koweit Neutral Zone—It has been thought for many years that this region might produce oil. The idea that it may be undeilam fthe s^geologi-l £ge as those of the Iraq and Persian oil-fieIds and hat potential oil structures might exist extending from Koweit to Qatar inclusive, has been encouraged by the striking of oil in quantity m Bahrein in 1932^ (3) The Farsan Islands and A sir .—Interest in these islands and/oi the mainland of Asir from the point of view of petroleum potentialities, seems to date from before the Great War. Operations were actually started on one of the islands by the Red Sea Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the bhell Gi oup, in 1926 or early in 1927, but drilling operations were subsequently abandoned as unsuccessful. As to Asir, see (D) (2). r&gt; .. i /ciViaII (4) Mokalla .—In 1928-29 the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Shell Group) carried out investigations, and reached the conclusion that the petroleum F %T S ^-The n 5n^o r -Pe e rsian Oil Company abandoned this area as unfavourable in 1925-26. (B) Interested or Potentially Interested Companies. (1) The Iraq Petroleum Company.—The Turkish Petroleum Company (now he Iraq Petroleum Company) was formed in 1912 when the Deutsche Bank •ecame associated with the National Bank of Turkey and e g , • Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group), in order to press certain claims o oil rights in Bagdad and Mosul, including those attached to the Bagdad Railway Concession. The chief rival of the new company at that time was the \.nglo-Persian Oil Company, which had for some time been in negotiation with he Turkish Government. In 1914 an agreement was entered into providing or the reconstitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, 10 m w I( - National Bank of Turkey withdrew, the new participants bem g the Anglo- D ersian Oil Company, 50 per cent.; the Anglo-Saxon Petro eum P , J , he Deutsche Bank, 25 per cent. each. This agreement also provided that the hree groups should give undertakings not to be interested directly or indi ectly n the production of oil in the Ottoman Empire in Europe and Asm (exc uding Egypt, Koweit and the Transferred Territories) except through the Turkish Petroleum Company. This agreement was signed by the British and German governments, and by the groups concerned. As the 1 urkish Petroleum Company vas then predominantly British, this arrangement had the effect of securing the .vhole of this area to interests which were predominantly British. After the svar American and French interests were admitted into the Iraq Peti oleum 7013 [879 1—1] CvPY■■Hm 2 a Jl d arrangement as regards non-competition between the grout* f j ^ sin ® e Iiaq Petroleum Company was confirmed in an agreement between entered into m 1928.

British 52 Italian 24 German 12 Franco-Swiss ... 12 100 In December 1932 a new company was formed, known as “ Mosul Oil-fields (Limited),” to acquire the shares in the British Oil Development Company and to carry on its operations. The company had a nominal capital of £1 million in £1 shares. In March 1933 the board of this company was reconstructed, and the Foreign Office was informed by the company that the directorate was as follows :— Viscount Goschen {chairman). Other British directors (5) : Sir Edward Mountain (deputy chairman), the late Admiral Lord Wester Wemyss, Lord Glenconner (director of Hambro’s Bank), W. R. Brown (director of British Union Oil Company), and Sir Alwin Dickinson (formerly the representative of the British Government on the British Phosphate Commission) as managing director. Italian directors (3) : Professor Alessandro Martelli, Gr. Uff. Arnaldo Petretti, and Gr. Uff. Vittorio Amoretti (Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli). German directors (2) : Herr Thomas Brown and Herr M. Hirschfeld. French director (1): M. Paul Girod. Iraq Government director (1): Jafar Pasha-el-Askeri; a total of thirteen. The company is not known to be at present interested in Saudi Arabia. (3) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company —See at (1) above as to A.P.O.C.’s participation in the I.P.C. and the restrictions imposed thereby. The A.P.O.C. has, however, in addition to its main concession in Persia, which has been confirmed by a revised agreement with the Persian Government, dated the 29th April, 1933, a separate interest also in Iraq, where, through its subsidiary, the Khaniqin Oil Company, it has a concession in the ” Transferred Territories ” under agreements with the Iraq Government on the 30th August, 1925, and the 24th May, 1926. It also has freedom of action in Koweit, where it is competing for a concession with the Eastern and General Syndicate, representing the Gulf Oil Corporation. (4) The Eastern and General Syndicate. —This is a British company registered in August 1920 with a nominal capital of £125,300. The chairman and managing director is E. W. Janson, and the other directors are F. W. Gamble, H. T. Adams and P. C. Tarbutt. It has, at various times, acquired concessions in Bahrein and Arabia, but has never carried out any really effective work, its sole object being apparently to obtain concessions and traffic in them to other parties. The company at one time approached the Anglo-Persian without success, and in 1927 and 1929 transferred its interests to the Eastern Gulf Oil Corporation of U.S.A. (see under (5) below). Its local representative is Major F. Holmes. (5) The Gulf Oil Corporation is a wholly American concern, working in the Near East through its subsidiary, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The Gulf Oil Corporation is a powerful company engaged in producing, transporting, refining and marketing oil throughout the United States, east of the Rocky Mountains. It is also engaged in producing oil in Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, and markets oil extensively in Europe. The principal interest in it is that of the Mellon family, who are said to have come in originally as financiers and to have ended up with an 80 per cent, interest. The Gulf is an independent company, but it is interested with the Socony—Vacuum Company (a recent merger of the Standard Oil Company of New York and Vacuum Oil Company), and S.O., New Jefsey, in the I.P.C. it is also interested with the Eastern and General Syndicate in a possible concession in Koweit. In 1927 it obtained an option from the Eastern and General on the Bahrein Concession, which the syndicate had secured in December 1925. Eventually, however, this concession was taken over by the Standard Oil of California, presumably because the Gulf, as a member of the I. P.C., could not hold it. In 1929 it acquired from the Eastern and General [879 1—1] b 2S3'* MHBHHBBBitei 4 Syndicate an option over any rights which the syndicate might possess in Hasa, the neutral zone and Koweit. It could only operate concessions in Hasa and probably also in the neutral zone with the permission of the I.P.C. (6) Standard Oil Com'pany of California. —After the break-up of the Standard Oil Group in 1912, many members of the group became independent, including the above company. This company is one of the largest oil companies in the United States, and is a complete unit, being engaged in producing, refining, transporting and marketing crude oil and refined products. The company is engaged in production in eight States in the United States, and has oil properties in Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. The Standard Oil Company of California and the Gulf are independent of each other, although there is a general impression that the various Standard Oil Companies still have some community of interest and are prepared to co-operate in matters of general policy. At times, however, there has been keen competition between them. As pointed out above, the Standard Oil Company of California holds the Bahrein Concession, which it operates through the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Canadian Corporation. It has also just secured from Ibn Saud an oil concession in Hasa, full particulars of which are not yet available. (C)— Past Concessions affecting Saudi Arabia. (1) Northern Hejaz. —It is possible that certain concessionary rights were granted in Turkish times, but this subject has not been explored in the Legation. There was talk of a concession under the Hashimite regime and Mr. Philby was one of those interested, but there is no evidence of a Hashimite concession having been granted. Any interest of Mr. Philby’s is presumably identical with that of Midian (Limited), an inactive but still going concern, closely allied with Sharqieh (Limited). (2) Jedda (Hejaz, West Coast of Arabia).—Two American engineers (Twitched and Crane) carried out investigations for oil in 1931. The Petroleum Department brought the matter to the notice of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who replied that the geological prospects in this area were not regarded as favourable (see under paragraph (A) (1)). (3) Muscat. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company obtained a concession in 1925 to prospect for oil for a period of two years with the right to a mining lease, but this concession has now lapsed. (4) Mokalla. —The Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company started negotiations for a concession in 1928-29, but the matter was not proceeded with as they reached the conclusion that the prospects of discovering petroleum were quite unfavourable. (5) Hasa. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company applied, probably for orospecting rights only r , to Ibn Saud in 1921. The E.G.o. came into the field later. At the beginning of 1923 Major Holmes submitted a draft concession to Sir P. Cox. In March 1923, the latter, acting under instructions from home, suggested to Ibn Saud that he should decide nothing until he had had an opportunity of considering an offer by A.P.O.C., whom His Majesty's Government considered to have a prior claim. About the same period or earlier the two companies were in touch with each other with a view to sharing interests, and it is stated that at one point they went through a pretence of breaking ofi negotiations so that Ibn Saud might give the concession to E.G.S. in ignorance of the interest of A.P.O.C., to whom he was hostile. Be that as it may, E.G.S. got the concession, and on the 6th May, 1923, Ibn Saud granted an oil concession (including the Qatif and Jubail areas) to the Eastern and General Syndicate. Major Holmes gave an undertaking not to sell any part of the concession to the A.P.O.C., and His Majesty’s Government thought of trying to induce Ibn Saud to cancel this restriction, but the proposal was abandoned in May 1924. Thus the A.P.O.C. were left out in the cold. The final terms of the concession to E.G.S. are not known, but there are indications that it followed the draft which had been submitted to Sir P. Cox That draft, and probably the actual concession, included alia, provision for the following :— {a) Lapse of the concession if E.G.S. should fail to start operations in a specified manner within nine months. (b) Government right to cancel the concession after any continuous cessation of operations for more than twenty months.(c) Payment of £3,000 a year for “special protection’’ in half-yearly pay ments, to begin sixty days after date. (d) Payment of £6,000 under pain of nullity of the concession, sixty days after date. (e) Arbitration in the event of any dispute. It is not clear what, if anything, E.G.S. did to implement the undertaking to start operations. It is known that on the 26th April, 1924, two geologists of theirs left Koweit to make a preliminary survey in “ Nejd, Koweit Neutral Zone and Hasa,’’ but it is not known to what this led. Anyhow, Major Holmes was in difficulties with Ibn Saud in October 1925, because, according to Bushire telegram to the Colonial Office of the 31st October, (a) Ibn Saud had refused to alter a clerical error of date, and (&amp;) E.G.S. would advance no more money. There was also apparently difficulty in obtaining financial support in London owing to the non-existence of British diplomatic representation at Nejd. It was probably at this time or a little later that E.G.S. and Major Holmes estranged Ibn Saud by refusing a payment which he claimed. ' There is no evidence that Ibn Saud formally cancelled the concession at this juncture. When, however, E.G.S. entered into an agreement with the Gulf Company on the 30th November, 1927. in regard to this, the Neutral Zone Concession and the hoped-for concession in Koweit, they admitted that both the former were “at least subject to forfeiture and cancellation, if not actually null and void.’’ . . , The negotiations which led to the grant of a concession m Hasa to the Standard Oil of California are understood to have been conducted by that company directly, and not through the intervention of the E.G.S. (6) ' Koweit Neutral Zone.—On the 17th May, 1924. an oil concession is alleged to have been granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit to the E.G.S. The E.G.S., by an agreement of the 30th November, 1927, transferred any rights which it might possess or acquire or which could be reinstated in Hasa or the Neutral Zone as well as in Koweit to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. The history of the concession is somewhat obscure. A recent Colonial Office memo randum concludes from a review of the known facts the “ impression . . . . that Ibn Saud did actually gyant the concession on his own without the consent of the Sheikh of Koweit.” As against this, E.G.S. definitely claimed to have got the concession from both, and it seems hardly likely that they would have committed themselves to this statement if it were untrue, in their definite legal agreement with the Gulf Company of the 30th November, 1927, as they certainly did. In any case, however, the grounds for considering this concession to have lapsed are even stronger than in the case of the Hasa Concession. E.G.S. not only admitted in the agreement with Gulf that it was like the other “at least subject to forefeiture,” &amp;c.. but stated in a letter to the Colonial Office of the 19th December, 1928, that it had “never been made operative.” The Sheikh of Koweit’s account of this concession is given in a recent despatch from the Political Agent dated the 6th July, 1933, which states that the Political Resident had an interview with the sheikh and discussed the matter. The sheikh’s recollection was that Ibn Saud gave the Hasa Concession proper to Major Holmes in the spring of 1923, its chief clause being that unless Major Holmes started work within three years the concession would lapse. Ibn Saud wrote in the summer of 1923 and sent the sheikh a draft draft joint concession in respect of the Koweit Neutral Zone, which he wished to give to Major Holmes’s company, the E.G.S., and asking the sheikh to sign it. His Majesty’s Government informed the sheikh that he could sign the joint concession. The concession was actually signed in April 1924, and consisted of only four pages, and it was duly sent on to ibn Saud. About a year afterwards Major Holmes had a disagreement with Ibn Saud, who informed Major Holmes that the joint Neutral Zone Concession was there and then cancelled. Ever since the Sheikh of Koweit has assumed the joint concession to be a dead letter, that is to say. from about April 1925. The Sheik of Koweit has been unable to ascertain whether Ibn Saud has included the Neutral Zone in the Hasa Concession recently granted to the Standard Oil Company of California. (7) Farsan Islands, now also a part of Saudi Arabia. —E.G.S. would appear to have obtained some sort of a concession for the Farsans (and possibly the mainland of Asir) from Hasan-al-Idrisi in 1926. It is not clear what became of this concession, if the grant was complete, but it was superseded by a concession6 for the Farsans given by the Idrisi on the 25th September, 1926. to a Mr. Cooper, who marketed it to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch Shell Group). The latter formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. This company started operations of some importance at Zifaf Island. The Idrisi, acting, it was thought at the time, under Italian influence, but more probably under that of Ibn Saud. made difficulties in the summer of 1927. After abortive efforts by the company to overcome them. Ibn Saud came forward ostensibly in the role of honest broker between the Idrisi, now his vassal, and the company. A conference held at Wizan in December 1927 under his auspices between the representatives of the company and the Idrisi was again abortive. Ibn Saud eventually intimated “ a decision in the question of the dispute which we were asked to settle between the Red Sea Petroleum Company and the Idrisi Govern ment to the effect that a new concession should be drawn up and that in the meantime it would be undesirable to accede to a request which the company had put forward for permission to transfer their operations from Zifaf to Great Farsan. He suggested that the company should send a representative to Jedda I to negotiate the revised concession. On his persisting in this attitude the company decided to withdraw from the islands and in September 1928 they removed all material under the auspices of H.M.S. Dahlia. It must be assumed that this terminated any rights under the Cooper Concession. The Shell Company has recently stated that it is not interested to reopen operations in the Farsan Islands. (D )—Present Position. Whatever view might possibly be held as to the legal position in regard to past concessions, it is quite certain that Ibn Saud believes himself to be quit of all of them and he is probably right. The position in regard to the various areas may be summed up as follows :— (1) Northern Hejaz .—Midian (Limited), closely associated with Sharqieh (Limited) or some other concern, may have had rights in this area, but there is no reason to think that they survive. No one seems to be actively interested at present. (2) A sir .Ibn Saud in June 1933 intimated that he would be prepared to consider offers for a concession from British companies. The matter was referred by the Petroleum Department to the I.P.C. within whose sphere of influence Asir fell and who were the only company with any British interests who were likely to be prepared to consider the matter. The I.P.C. have intimated that they are prepared to send out geologists to make an examination if they can secure the necessary rights without payment during the exploratory period. (3) Hasa. After some competition between the Iraq Petroleum Company (who sent a representative out to negotiate in 1933) and the Standard Oil Company of California, a concession was ultimately granted to the latter. It is under stood from information obtained from the I.P.C. that the concession was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the terms being an initial payment of £30,000 (gold) and a further deferred payment of £20,000 (gold) with a royalty at 55 . per ton. (4) Qatar. The A.P.O.C., acting on their own initiative but with the object of transfer to the I.P.C.. secured an exclusive option from the sheikh to carry out geological investigations for a period of two years with the right to apply for a concession within that period. A draft concession approved by the I.P.C. has recently been submitted by the A.P.O.C. to the sheikh. (5) Koweit Neutral Zone .—The present position in regard to this area is not clear. It may be true that Major Holmes’s primary object in coming to Jedda in April 1933 was to obtain Ibn Saud’s consent to a regrant, so far as the Saudi Government are concerned, of a concession for this area. But it may also be the case that so far as Ibn Saud is concerned, he has included the Neutral Zone with the Hasa Concession. This position is at present under consideration by His Majesty’s Government. (6) Farsan Islands—There has been no activity since 1928 and both the Shell and the Anglo-Persian have recently informed the Petroleum Department that they are not interested any longer in obtaining a concession over these islands.

October, 1933. •vv' Y My dear Rendel, With reference to your letter of'September 21st enclosing a translation of the Hasa Oil Concession granted to the Standard Oil Company of California, I have now|had an opportunity of examining the concession and I enclose some notes on its principal provisions. The absence of information regarding the area to be covered and also details as to the financial arrangements maKe it, however, difficult to size up the value of the concession, and it would be of great value if H.M.Minister could manage to get hold of a copy of the unpublished Supplementary Agreement which contains these particulars. There may be some difficulty over this but it will presumably throw some light on what Ibn Saud has done as regards the Neutral Zone. to be of considerable value to the Standard Oil Company of California as being in such close proximity to their Bahrein concession and it gives them a big footing in agreement is rather vaguely worded in places and I am not sure that the translation is free from blemishes in parts. It is interesting to note that the Company have come into line with the 4/~ rate of royalty If oil is discovered, the Concession is likely slM the Gulf l As pointed out in the accompanying note, the providedprovided for in the Iraq Agreements (the rate in the Bahrein Agreement is just over 5/-) but if the other financial obligations are at ail substantial they would have a bearing on this question. Several of the revisions we have suggested for the Mining Lease in the case of Bahrein are included in this Agreement. The Arbitration Clause shows some resemblance to that included in the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company Agreement. The recent experiencesof the A.P.O.C. in Persia will not be overlooked by oil companies in entering into future agreements with foreign governments. While the Agreement could obviously be improved in several respects on the whole it is not, in its general conception, a bad document from the Government’s point of view. I am sending a copy of this letter and the enclosure to Laithwaite. Yours &amp;c., (Sd) F.C.STARLING.Notes by Petroleum Department on Hasa Oil Concession (granted to Standard Oil Company of California). Agreement of May 29th, 1933. Enclosure to Foreign Office Letter No. E.4699/487/25 of September 20th,1933. Period of Lease - 60 years. This is the same as in Persia and somewhat similar to the periods granted in Iraq and Bahrein. The Company has exclusive rights over the area for the exploitation of oil for the whole period but the area is not defined in this agreement. Dead Rent. There is an annual dead rent, the amount of which is not stated. The first payment has to be made within 15 days of the agreement becoming operative (17th July, 1933). A loan also has to be paid to the Government at the same time as the first dead rent payment is made (the amount of this loan is not stated). Working Obligations. Maps and geological reports have to be submitted to the Government and an annual report on the work done. (Article 23). Geological . Work must commence by September 1933, and drilling within 3 years. Drilling must continue with two rigs until the whole area has been explored in conformity with usual practice. Dead rents cease when oil in considerable commercial quantity is discovered.Note: M Canmercial discovery' is defined in Article 7 as when the Company completes the 'digging' (sinking) of one well or wells giving a test production (in conformity with reliable practice observed in first-class oil fields) of not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil daily for a period of 30 days. This means nearly 750,000 tons a year, and is a pretty severe test. It may be several years before this stage is reached. The absence of particulars as to the amount of the loan and dead rents makes it impossible to say whether there is sufficient inducement to the Company to proceed to commercial production as quickly as possible. The tonnage royalty payable under the Agreement is 4/- gold (Article 11) and on 750,000 tons this would represent £150,000 per annum. The rate of royalty is the same as in Iraq. On the establishment of commercial production another loan has to be made to the Government and a year later a further loan. Again no amounts are mentioned. Under Article 12, if the Company extracts, stores and sells any kind of mineral oil, a royalty of l/8th of the revenue from sales is payable. This provision is •» rather difficult to understand. If it is worth anything it may involve the Company in substantial payments. They may possibly get over it by setting up subsidiary companies. Measurement of Oil &amp;c. There are reasonable provisions as to measurement of oil won and the keeping of accounts. The Government has the right to check the quantities.- 3 9 0 Hefinerieso i There is a provision that the Company may establish a refinery sufficient to meet the needs of the Government. The Government may not sell any oil thus obtained either inside or outside the country. After the establishment of a refinery the Company has to offer to the Government a 'loose” quantity (? bulk supply) of about 200,000 gallons of petrol and about 100,000 gallons of kerosene free of charge. The value of petrol at the refinery would not be less than say 5 d a gallon and kerosene 3d or 4d a gallon so that this again represents a substantial obligation if the refinery is erected, but it is not clear that the Company is obliged to instal a refinery. (The wording of this and some other parts of the agreement is somewhat vague and may be due to faulty translation). 10. Taxes &amp;c. The Company is to be free from all direct and indirect taxes, dues, charges and fees (including customs dues on export and import). 11. Nationality Restrictions &amp;o. The Concession is to be managed by Americans but subjects of Saudi Arabia are to be employed as far as possible. The Company shall not engage the subjects of any other Government. 1£. Reservation of Minerals. Other Minerals are reserved to the Government. 13. Dhe Company can terminate the agreement on i. giving 30 days' notice. The Government has the right to terminate the agreement for failure on the part of the Company to comply with these obligations. The Company may also be fined for breach of conditions. {!&gt;'14 « Arbitratioru The arbitration clause provides for the appointment of an umpire and in the event of the failure of the arbitrators appointed by the two parties to agree, the umpire is to be appointed by the President of the Permanent Court of International Justice. 15. Transfer. The Company is not allowed to transfer its rights without the consent of the Government. Subsidiary companies may be formed and inhabitants of Saudi Arabia have the right to subscribe up to 20$ of the capital of any company formed. 9.10.33. hpwg/mj .w u A wt. CONFIDENTIAL.

N. Hamilton on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California, hereinafter called the Company, on the other hand. The Agreement concluded between the Government and the Company is as follows :— Article 1. The Government grant the Company, in pursuance of this agreement and in conformity with the following conditions concerning the area defined hereundei for a period of sixty years as from the date on which this agreement is P u ^ force, full right to survey, prospect, drill, extract, produce, treat manufacture, transport, handle and export petroleum, asphalt naphtha (mmeraloilj natural grease and tallow, other carbonaceous liquids, and the extracts of these P &lt; ^ dut ^ It is understood that this right does not under any circumstances include the grant of full right to sell crude or refined products within the limits ot the undermentioned zone or within the Saudi Arab Kingdom [s?£j. [991 m—3] B2 Article 2. The area to which the full right referred to in article 1 of this agreement applies has been agreed upon between the two contracting parties. Article 3. The Company shall remit to the Government within the period agreed upon in this agreement a preliminary loan as agreed. Article 4. The Company shall pay to the Government annually an amount which has been agreed upon. This payment will for the sake of simplicity be denoted as “ annual rent,” and this rent shall be paid in advance. The rent for the first year shall be paid within the period provided for in article 15 of this agreement, and subsequently, and for so long as this agreement is not cancelled, the annual rent will be payable at the beginning of each period of one year reckoned from the date on which this agreement is put into force. This rent must be paid within thirty days from the beginning of each year, provided that, immediately after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, no further annual rent will be claimed or will be liable for payment. Article 5. As from the date of this agreement coming into force, the Company shall proceed with its plans and preparations for the geological work and its arrange ments for work, so that it may take advantage of the cold weather in order to undertake effectual field work, and may carry out the clerical work and make reports, &amp;c., during the hot season. In any case, the field work shall not be delayed beyond the end of September 1933. Such work shall be energetically and continuously carried on until the beginning of boring operations or to the end of the agreement. Article 6. Within ninety days of the date on which boring operations start, the Company shall surrender to the Government those parts of the included area in which it may decide to discontinue work or which it may decide to use in another manner in connexion with this undertaking. The Company shall also surrender to the Government from time to time during the period of this agreement such other areas as the Company may decide are no longer required for prospecting or examination, or for use for any purpose in connexion with this undertaking. All the areas thus surrendered by the Company shall be released from the restrictions and conditions of this agreement, but the Company shall have the permanent right to employ those areas for the purposes of transport and communications, during the duration of this agreement, provided that this use of them shall cause only slight interference with the other purposes for which these areas surrendered by the Company can be used. Article 7. The Company shall start boring operations as soon as it discovers a suitable site, and in any case, if the Company shall not have started boring operations within a period of three years from the end of September 1933 (subject to the observation of the provisions of article 24 of this agreement), the Government may then terminate this agreement. Whenever the Company begins boring operations it shall continue them energetically, either until it discovers oil in commercial quantities or until the expiry of this agreement. If the Company fails to announce the discovery of oil in commercial quantities at the time, then the date to be reckoned as being the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date on which the Company shall have completed the sinking of a well or wells, and shall have examined them and found them capable of supplying not less than 2,000 tons of crude oil per day for a period of thirty days consecutively, in conformity with the practice observed in first-class oil-fields.3 Boring operations include the ordering of implements and plant and their ship ment to Saudi Arabia, and also include the making and preparation of roads, camps, buildings, fittings, transport and communications, and the erection and running of tools, machines and other means of well-sinking, &amp;c. Immediately after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall remit to the Government the loan which has been agreed upon, and after one year shall make them another loan. The date of remitting the first loan shall be that on which oil is discovered in commercial quantities as laid down in this agreement, and that of remitting the second loan shall be after one year from that date. In both cases the Government shall grant the Company a period of sixty days’ delay in which to pay it. discovering oil in commercial quantities, and as it has also been agreed that the annual rent should be paid in advance, it is possible that the last payment of annual rent before the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities may include a certain period after the date of discovery. If this extra period equals one-fifth of a year or more, an amount of annual rent proportional to this period will be considered as a loan due by the Government. As soon as possible {i.e., the Company will be allowed a reasonable time for ordering tools and additional materials and for getting them shipped to Saudi Arabia to start the additional work) after the date of discovering oil in commercial quantities the Company shall resume boring operations, employing at least two of the machines, and shall continue these operations persistently and energetically till it completes boring all over the prescribed area, m conformity with the practice observed in first-class oil-fields, or until the expiry of this agreement.

The Company shall always measure the quantities of oil produced and stored and which run from the field depot, in accordance with the practice observed in first-class oil-fields, and shall keep true and correct accounts of them; similarly for the mineral oils which it may produce, store and sell, properly authorised Government representatives have the right to check these accounts at all convenient times. After the expiry of one half year i from the date on which oil is discovered in commercial quantities, the Company shall submit to the Government a half-yearly account within a period of three months from the end of the said half year, and a statement showing the amount of royalty due to the Government for that half year. The Government shall be bound to treat these accounts and statements as confidential, with the exception of those figures which they may find it necessary to publish for financial purposes.

In the event of any dispute occurring in respect of the amount of royalty due for a half year, the Company shall hand over to the Government, within the period stipulated above, that part of the royalty which is not in dispute. The matter of dispute which may arise between the two parties shall be settled by mutual agreement; if a settlement is not arrived at in this manner, the dispute shall be settled by arbitration as provided for in this agreement. Any amount the payment of which is decided as a result of this settlement shall be paid to the Government within sixty days of the date on which the decision is given. Article 14. It is agreed that all gold payments provided for in this agreement, whether gold pounds or gold shillings, shall be calculated by means of English gold pounds in accordance with their weight and pureness at the time of payment. It is also agreed that the payments of gold currency provided for in this agree ment, whether gold pounds or gold shillings, may be made by means of an equivalent amount of American dollars or pounds sterling.

The Government have the right to change this bank from time to time provided that they inform the Company of such action in writing, so as to give the Company sufficient time to enable them to arrange for subsequent payments to be made to the new bank. It is agreed that the Government should nominate for this purpose a bank in either Saudi Arabia, the United States of America, England, or Holland, provided that no bank be fixed in Saudi Arabia unless it has a correspondent in the United States of America, England or Holland, through whom money can be remitted to Saudi Arabia. In the event of the Company having made any payment to the Government in the proper manner, or having deposited the sum due to them in5 any bank, or having paid the sum to the correspondent of a bank for transmission to Saudi Arabia, then the Company shall be released from all responsibility in respect of such payment. It has been agreed that the first payment agreed upon (i.e., the preliminary loan and the rent of the first year) shall be paid within a period of fifteen days from the date on which this agreement comes into force to the correspondents of the Netherlands Trading Society of Jedda (Saudi Arabia) at New York or London for immediate transmission to the Netherlands Trading Society mentioned above, and for handing over to the Government against proper receipt. The expenses incurred in this connexion will be charged to the Company. If this first payment is not paid in gold it may be paid in pounds sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the time when the Company pays the said amount to the correspondent of the bank. Article 16. After the discovery of oil in commercial quantities within a reasonable period, the Company shall choose a place within Saudi Arabia so as to establish a factory to make a quantity of benzine and kerosine sufficient for the ordinary requirements of the Government, provided that the crude oil found is of a nature adequate for such manufacture on a commercial basis by ordinary processes of refining, and that the oil produced is adequate for these purposes. It is understood that the requirements of the Government will not include sales on their part inside or outside Saudi Arabia. The Company shall proceed to establish this factory after completing the necessary preliminary arrangements, and after obtaining the Government’s approval of the place which they suggest. During each successive period of one year following the date of completion of the establishment of this factory, the Company shall supply to the Government, in bulk and free of charge, 200,000 American gallons of benzine and 100,000 American gallons of kerosine.

J. Lenahan, arrived here as its Jedda representative on the 18th October. Mr. Lenahan, who has previously served his company in South America in an administrative rather than a practical capacity, has had no previous experience of this part of the world. In conversation with me recently he stated that five geologists, presumably Americans, had already arrived in Hasa and had been met by Mr. Twitched, who had assisted them in commencing their work. Mr. Lenahan added that more geologists were on their way and were shortly expected to arrive in Hasa. 2. It is understood that Mr. Twitched is returning to Jedda very shortly and that he expects to proceed on leave almost at once. 3.

My dear Warner, With reference to my letter to you No.3255/353/72 of the 28th November last, relative to the Hasa Oil Concession, I mentioned the matter of the unpublished annexure to the Standard Oil Company's of California's concession to Philby on the 6th December shortly sifter his return from Egypt. I found him quite helpful. He stated that although he did not possess a copy of the secret agreement, he was present in an unofficial but advisory capacity at the 'Cabinet' meeting that finally examined the concession, clause by clause and approved it. He had also something to do with the verification of the translation. He thought he could remember most of the Secret clauses and promised to look through his papers. He w s then about to leave for Mecca and promised to let me know soon but he is again in Mecca and it may be a week or two before I see him next. I give you hereunder. however, the points he mentioned to me off-hand in conversation, as forming part of the secret agreement:- 1 . Finance . The £35,000 gold recently paid by the Company to the Government consisted of £5,000 gold as rent and £30,000 gold as loan. (Comment: The missing sum in Article 3 is perhaps £30,000 gold and that in Article 4, £5,000 gold.) Aft^r a period of several months (I think 6 ), the Company was to pay a further £20,000 gold, making A.Warner, Esq., £50,000/ Eastern Department, Foreign Office.2 £50,000. Upon oil being struck in paying quantities, the Company was to make a further loan of £50,000 gold - total £100,000 gold. Philby also stated he had an idea there was a provision for^bhe payment of a further £50,000 gold at the end of tvso years. (Comment; There is no mention of this in the agreement; unless it all forms part of the sum mentioned in Article 3. The sum mentioned in Article 8 = £50,000 - one year after dicovery, another £50,000 to be paid). 2. Aeroplanes . There is a clause permitting the Company to operate planes in Hasa. (Comments Article 19). 3. Kuwait Neutral Zone . There is a clause on this subject which, Philby thought, ran as follows: i to give the Comi any the concession for the the area. j£n the event of this proving e, the Sa'udi Arab Government would try to get o whom he (the Sheykh) eventually gave a concession in ms sphere of this zone with the terms Ibn Sa’ud made with the Standard Oil Company of California, The latter would therefore be at no disadvantage competitively. (Comment: Ho reference in concession.) able to send you a fuller statement in the course of a few weeks. I undertook to treat anything that Philby might tell me on this, or any other subject as given in strict confidence. P.S. The comments in parentheses refer to the published concession, of course. TO The Sa*udi Arab Government promised to use their with the Sheykh of Kuwait to get him to agree the Sheykh to agree to making identical terms with the 2.

My dear Gilbert, With reference to cur official letter No.E 150/150/91 of the 6th January about the aeroplane which the California Arabian Standard Oil Company wish to use for their operations in Hasa, I send you the following account of my telephone i conversations with the United States Embassy. As tx.e itinerar;/ of the aeroplahe, as given in the American note, stops short at Bahrein, I asked the Embassy whether the Company were proposing to quarter their machine there or whether in fact it was going on to Saudi-Arabia and would have its base there. I took the opportunity to explain briefly the position in regard to private flights along the Arabian coast. The Embassy promised to make enquiries and telephoned yesterday to say that, if possible, the Company would prefer to base their aeroplane on Bahrein, but as the Embassy have gathered from what I said previously to them that private flights are not permitted along the Arabian route, they understood that they may not be allowed to do so. They asked that we should state in our eventual reply to their note whether the Company would be allowed to use Bahrein or not. I am sanding oopies of this letter to MoOlaughry and Blaxter.

Dear Iflfarner, I enclose herewith a brief note of a talk I had recently with Janson, who was sent on to me by Parrer, regarding the possibility of an oil concession in Asir. On the receipt of Foreign Office printed letter ^O^of the 13th July, 1933 (E.3804/487/25), I wrote to Cadman who informed me that arrangements had been made for Longrigg to see Fuad as Ryan suggested. But I gather from a recent inquiry I made of Fraser that nothing Yery definite has happened up to the present. I was careful not to give Janson any indication of what line H.M.Government might take if we were asked to support the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate. He merely seemed anxious to keep himself right with us by letting us know what is going on. I may mention, although I did not record it in the note of the interview, that Janson appeared to wish to justify the Syndicate in what they had done in regard to Bahrein and the other Gulf areas where at one time they held some kind of concessions. He stated that they had done what they could to interest the Anglo—i ersian Oil Company, and said that at one period (about 1925) the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had taken an option from the Syndicate in regard to certain of the areas. He inquired whether I would be interested to have a precis of the correspondence, etc. I replied that if he cared to send it to me I would put it on record. Subsequently he rang me up to say that he had found on reference to his files that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had not in fact entered ^Warner, Esq., into/ [K)HEI GN OFFICE,into any definite arrangement, which is what I understood to he the case. He again offered to send me a note, and I thanked him. But nothing has so far reached me. This is to some extent wrapped up with the activities of the Arabian Development Syndicate in the Neutral Zone, and one of these days we may have to let Ryan have our views on the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate and their friends in relation to their activities in Saudi Arabia. I merely pass this information on now for your own use, and am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite and Seal. Yours sincerely, ( D.) F.C,STARLING.NOTE OF IWSRVIIjlW. Mr. a. .Janson, oi the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, had an interview with Mr. Starling on May 18th, 1934, and said that the Syndicate were taking an interest in the question of obtaining oil concessions on the V/estern side of Arabia and had been told by Ibn Saud that he would be prepared to grant the Syndicate a concession in respect of Asir. He believed that the Standard Oil of California were also interesting themselves in the matter, and unless something was done quickly by a British Company, the Standard Company was likely to take up this concession. He had seen the questions raised in Parliament recently about Bahrein, and it might be inferred from these that the Syndicate was in some way responsible for that concession going to the Americans. He thought, therefore, that he ought to let the Petroleum Department know about the Asir proposition. Mr. Starling said that Ibn Saud’s territory was in a different position from that of the Sheikhdoms on the Eastern coast of Arabia, where the British Government had to be consulted in connection with the grant of concessions. The British Government were naturally desirous that British oil companies should take up oil concessions wherever prospects seemed at all favourable, but Mr. Starling said that he could not do more than take note of what Mr. Janson had told him.I So) 2 - [ 14 / 4 / 25 ) ^2221/81/130 BiilTISH LEO TION, JKL1&gt; SAUDI A&amp;iBIA. 24th July 1954 5,0)0. 5,000. &gt; Please refer to Hyen's Confioential letter to you No. 77/81/3 Of the 8th January last on the subject of the Standard Oil Company of California’s Haaa Concession. ii£yan tells iae, in a note from the Khedlvial ship bearing him away on leave, that whilst at Taif Philby informed him that the Saudi Government had just encashed the twenty thousand pounds gold payable as second Instalment of the initiel loan. This makes a total of fifty thousand pounds gold loan ; and in addition, five thousand pounds gold was paid last year as annuel rent. I suppose another five thousand pounds gold will soon be due. I will try and confirm all this discreetly. Last nitht the three Dutch bankers here scouted the idea that Ibn Sa'dd had obtained a secret indemnity from the Imam (of which, I understand, Philby is convinced), so i&amp;at, if true, this 'naft-geld' will be very welcome to repair the wasted sinews and tissues of the Saudi Treasury.
