W. 1 (E 7378/401/0) 5665 Would you kindly refer to Tehran telegram No.11 69 A of the 28th July, a further copy of which I enclose for / convenience of reference. You have already telegraphed to the Political Resident informing him that the Ambassador has withdrawn his recommendation for the postponement of the transfer of the Residency and that the decision to make the transfer stands. No further action therefore seems to be required on this part of the telegram. 2. With regard to the second paragraph of the tele gram, we feel that in view of the political situation in South Persia Le Rougetel is right in suggesting that a new Consul General should be appointed forthwith to Bushire. Since this post has been staffed in the past by the Government of India and since it has adminis trative responsibilities for the other South Persian consulates staffed by the Government of India, we think that it would be appropriate if the Government of India could now provide a Consul General for it as before. We trust therefore that you will feel able to approach them and ask them to make a suitable officer available as soon as possible. If they feel that they could make Colonel Galloway available we should be very glad. 3 . As regards paragraph 3 of Le Rougetel ! s telegram, we are awar^that 'the Government of India have in the past felt doubts as to the desirability of placing the feonsul at Khorramshahr under the supervision of the Consul General at Ahwaz in rs * E. P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. , India Office.r\ We feel, however, that, since Le Rougetel has now recommended that this should 'be done as part of his general recommendations for improving our position in South Persia and in view of the advantages of having the whole of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's area within the responsibility of a single Consular Officer, Le Rougetel*s view should prevail. We trust that you will feel able to urge the acceptance of this view on the Government of India as a matter of urgency.' You will note that Sir Clarmont Skrine is in agreement with Le Rougetel's views. We have no objection to what we understand to be Le Rougetel's suggestion that the Consulate at Khorrarashahr should continue to be under the supervision of Bushire for administrative purposes. \ / (C. W. Baxter)[This telegram is of particular secrecy and should he retained 'by the authorised recipient and not passed on] Recommendation 13 in my despatch No. 228 has been over taken by events and I do not wish to press it now.

A closer association with Consul- G-eneral Ahwaz would however strengthen rather than weaken Consular representation in the Company's sphere, in view of the large number of Indians in his district His Hajesty’s Consul Khorramshahr should continue to be a member of Indian political service.

I have carefully been considering the future of the Persian Gfulf linistarial Cadre and I am strongly of dpinion that it should continue to be administered by the political Resident as hitherto. 1 great deal of of labour will be involved if it is decided to form separate cadres for the Irab shore of the Persian Rulf on the one hand an for the Persian Consulates staffed t oy the Government of India on the other f and the cadres so formed will be too si^all. Pith tiie impending constib -utional changes in India it appears to me to be far the most sensible course to allow esisting arrangements to continue until more is known about the future of the offices concerned. 3. Another reason for maintaining existing arrange ments is that they provide an opportunity to give ~ members of the Tinisterial Staff whose health has suffered from the damp heat of tire Gulf a change of climate in Kerman oA- the Cast Persian Consulates. 4* . Prii:ia [ fa cie I see no reason why the Political Resident should not continue to correspond direct with the heads of offices concerned about establishment matters, and this appears the simplest and speediest method.

Y/e have much to lose by an abrupt break with the past. It would for instance be deplorable to leave former Residency derelict because the new encumbent could not afford to live in it. This would be interpreted as due to a policy of scuttle and effect would be particularly pernicious at the^present time. Our attitude should be that we are voluntarily giving^up what is no longer in keeping with the times. But are maintaining to the full our legitimate position and influence. 2. I suggest therefore that Bushire should be filled by a Consul General having supervision of [grp, undec. ] Consulate posts in South Persia. He would be parallel to the Consul* Generalat Meshed and would carry out similar political and commercial duties. He should I consider live in residency but work in the Consular Offices in Bushire town. He would of course give up any '’pro rata Consular” customs, e.g. with regard^to flag flying which may still remain at Bushire and would in general conform to Consular practice elsewhere in Persia. Mr. Galloway would be an excellent first appointment. [CYPHER] DEP^RTMENTiJj NO, 2 . FROM TEHRxjh TO FOREIGN OFFICE Mr. Le Rougetel. NO, 781 5th June, 1946. D. 2.54 p.m. 5th June, 1946.

It is recognised and regretted that H.M.G. ? s decision to transfer headquarters from Buehire to Bahrein before permanent accommodation has been found or built at latter must entail a considerable measure of dislocation, and inconvenience icr Political Resident and his staff. I fear, however, that, fsr^- rehsons given in paragraph 2 of my telegram March 21st No* 5793, H.M.G.’s decision must stand. 3, Consequently Hay cannot be appointed to perform Consular functions at Bushire, and move will necessarily have to be carried out without his personal supervision* It is not accepted as essential that the Political Resident should himself Supervise the arrangements for the transfer to Bahrein of the staff and archives at present at Bushire. 4. Consular supervision over posts in South Persia staffed by Indian Service Officers could not well be exerciser' from Bahrein; and if Consul, Busbire, cannot be put in charge of this, perhaps work could be undertaken by Skrine from. Tehran, necessary subordinate staff beinv transferred with The wor^ r Hew R* d exng residency at Bahrei.a cannot in any case be constructed for at least two years; temporary arrangements must therefore continue during intervening period.

In that year the Political Resident suggested that the increase of work at Bushire, due to the war, warranted the division of the work of the Secretary and the appointment of a full-time Consul (Ext. 1342/43)* The Government of India supported this proposal as a wartime measure, and it was duly sanctioned by H.M.G. (Ext.2149/43)* In order to enable the Secretary to the Political Resident to continue to enjoy consular privileges he retained the rank of Consul, the new appointment being that of Additional Consul. (Ext. 2235/43). The Political Resident has reconmended the permanent retention of this post in view of the increased Consular work likely to arise from the freeing of trade and the opening up of industry,and of the assistance given to the Resident by the Consul in the supervision of Consular work along the South Persian shore. The Government of India, however, limit their proposals to the continuation of the present arrangement until 28th February, 1947, pending the re-organisation of the Indian Political Service. Expenditure on the Bushire Consulate General is divisible in moieties between H.M.G. and the Government of In&lt;3ia, and a draft letter to the Foreign Office requesting concurrence in the Government of India* s proposal is below.Ext. 1122/1*6 DRAFT LETTER Under S e cretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.1. Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No* K* 6203/449/234 of 10th May; Regarding the creation of a full-time Consul at Bushire, I am directed to inform yew that a recommendation has *been received from the Government of I n dia that this arrangement should continue for a further period of one year pending the re-organisation of the Indian Political Service, The Government of India base this recommendation on the consideration that the Consular work at Bushire is likely to increase considerably with the freer movement of trade and the opening up of industry; and that, in addition the Consul will be called upon to assist the Resident in the supervision of all Consular work along the South Persian coast fron/from Bandar Dilam to the I n dian border East of Chahbar.

Upgrading of the pogt of Vice Consul to Consul with a superior status, and consequent raising of status of Assistant to the vice Consul to vice Consul, were sanctioned for the duration of the war. Political Resident, Persian Gulf, now recommends continuance of existing arr&amp;nuernents as a permanent measure for the following reasons (a) Khorramsliahr is now a rail head and has been developed into a large port. (b) Tho vast expansion of the A.I.0.0. and the need for an experienced officer to deal with labour disputes, an appreciable portion of the labour being Indian. (o) A large proportion of Persia s sea-borne trade, other than that with Russia, is likely to pass throu^i Khorramshahr in the near future. (d) The port is likely to become also an outlet for Russian goods. 3. In your telegram No.6194, dotad the # 23rd April 1943, sanction was accorded to the creation of the post of Consul * Bu shire, for the duration of war. The Political ue si dent raco^/nends the permanent retention of this post, a» the freer movement of trade and the opening up of industry will result in cor-side^obly more Consular work. In addition^ the Consul will be called upon to assist the Resident with the supervision of all Consular work along the coast from iand&amp;r ^ilam in the north-western confer of the Persian Gulf, to the Indian border beyond G hah bar. 4. The Govema.etjt of .India consider that paiding the roor^nimtion of the Indian Political Service cadre, the existing arrangements in Khorramehahr and Rushire f hould continue for the present, up to the 28th of ebruary 1947. 5.

The post of full-time Consul at Bush ire, as distinct from that of the Consul-cum-Seoretaiy to the Political Resident, was created in the Spring of this year. (Submission at Ext. 131 * 3 / 4 . 3 , Ert. 2149/4.3 and Ext. 2442A3 flagged). The expenditure involved is devisable in moieties between H.M. G» and the Government of India under the arrangements covering diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf. Mr. R.G. Daubeny was appointed in May and draws pay on the I.P.S. time scale with special pay of Rs. 200 per mensem , Customs compensatory allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem. He does not appear to be qualified to draw the language allowance. The Government of India now suggest that a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 100 per mensem should be added to the emoluments of this post. As the amount involved is very small it could have been sanctioned by the Government of India themselves under the present arrangement by which H.M.G. and the Government of India can sanction diplomatic and consular expenditure on posts in Persia and the Persian Gulf up to a £1,000 per annum (papers below Government of India telegram) $ presumably the matter has been referred to us as it concerns a new post. In the circumstances perhaps we might sanction this without reference to the Foreign Office and the Treasury. A draft telegram is attached. ^0 . 144 / t'''' /A c.

March 24th, 1931 — t '. i I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of correspondence exchanged with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in regard to the recognition of Captain Bradshaw as His Majesty’s Consul at Bushire. 2. I should explain that Before drafting my note of January 6th I had instructed the Oriental Secretary to point out verbally to the Head of the Protocol Section the unusual character of the restrictions in question and the inconve nience which they would cause. The latter advanced the somewhat threadbare excuse that his Government were afraid of the effect on the Soviet authorities of any concession in this direction though the object of the ruling may well be to reduce the number of Soviet officials in the country. But »he» pressed he hi.setf s« S6 es«,d that the Lesstion should address an official note to the Ministry in terms similar to those which I subsequently employed. It is perhaps surprising in the circumstances that the arguments adduced have apparently not 'been considered sufficient hut presumably the Head of the Protocol Department has been overruled by his superior officers. I understand that an additional American /ice-consul is on his way out to Persia, and that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs have informed the United States Legation that they will not recognise him as there is already an American A The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson M.P., The Foreign Office.American Vice-Consul in Tehran who holds an exequatur. The restrictions are therefore not directed exclusively against His Majesty’s Government. 4. I am not aware how far the Persian Government are within their rights in thus endeavouring to set a limit to the number of Consular officers in any one place enjoying the somewhat exiguous Consular privileges and I should therefore he glad to have your observations before I take further action in the matter. The practical result will of course be unfortunate as depriving one if not two Consular officers at Bushire of Customs privileges. I have the honour to be etc., (Signed) R.C. PARR.■ - Translation . From the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty's Charge d*Affaires. Dated Dai 4th 1309(December 25th 1930) No.25264. Monsieur le Charge d*Affaires, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your esteemed note of Azer 15th 1309(December 6th,1930) No.442, in which you state that it is proposed to appoint (Mr.(Captain) Bradshaw, who was formerly introduced as a member of the British Consulate-General staff at Bushire, as British Consul there in addition to (Mr.(Major) Fowle and like the last mentioned person, under the superintendence of H.B.M's Consul-General in that town and that you request (my Government's) agreement and ask for the issue of an exequatur. In reply, I have the honour to state that, as you are aware, the Imperial Government admit only one consular institution of each Government in the towns where consular posts exist and an exequatur will only be issued to one consular officer of each rank lower than that of the head of the post under whose superintendence he is serving whether the head of the post be a Consul-General or a Consul. Other members of the staff who have the rank of Consul or Vice- Consul, will not be recognised officially in such capacity and no exequatur will be issued to them as (is done) in the case of those acting at consular posts(sic) nor will they, while in Persian territory, enjoy special exemptions (privileges) which are accorded to Consuls-General,Consuls and Vice-Consuls. Therefore,owing to the presence, beside the Consul- GeneralGeneral in Bushire, of a Consul and a Vice Consul, the recognition of Mr.(Captain) Bradshaw as British Consul in Bushire under the superintendence of the British Consul- General would not he compatihle with the above procedure* I avail myself etc., (Signed) FeroughiCopy of English text. British Legation, 3' Tehran No.8 6th January 1931 Monsieur le Ministre I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Highness* note No.25264 of the 4th Bey Mah regarding the appointment of Captain Bradshaw as His Majesty’s Consul at Bushire. 2. I note that Your Highness objects in principle to the recognition of more than one subordinate Consular Officer of the same rank at the same post. 3. In this connection I venture to draw the attention of Your Highness to the fact that in different parts of the world there are British Consular Officers of the same posts under the direction of senior Consular officers and that they are all recognised by the Government of the country in which they are serving. 4. To give a few varied instances At New York there is one Consul-General Two Consuls and six vice-consuls San Francisco One Consul-General one Consul and Three Vice-Consuls Barcelona One Consul-General and Four Vice-Consuls. -Rotterdam One Consul General and Four Vice-Consuls. Hamburg One Consul-General and Three Vice-Consuls. Antwerp One Consul-General and Five X1 xm« Vice-Consuls. Constantinople One Consul-General One Consul and Four Vice-Consuls. Shanghai His Highness Mirza Mohamed Ali Khan Feroughi Minister for Foreign Affairs.Shanghai One Consul-General Three Consuls and Two Vice-Consuls. 5. I have chosen these places to show that the procedure is current over the whole globe and it is dictated solely by the amount of work with which each post has to deal. There is, of course, as Your Highness will observe, no question of having two heads of a post, it is only a question of the plurality of subordinate Consular Officers. 6. This is exactly the case with Bushire where the Staff has to deal with a very wide area, and I trust that now that Your Highness learns that I am not asking for anything which other Governments refuse to accord, my request for the recognition of Captain Bradshaw as Consul and of Captain Alban as Vice-Consul at Bushire will be accepted by the Imperial Persian Government, irrespective of the fact of there being other Consular Officers at Bushire of the same rank, the necessity for whose presence there is solely dictated by the amount of work with which the Oonsulate-General has to deal.

Biscoe as Consul General. Major T.C.W. Fowle as Consul. Major H.J.M. Symons as Vice Consul. 2* I should explain that the transfer of Major Fowle to Muscat during the early part of the present year does not appear to have been notified to this Legation, nor, in consequence, to the Persian Govern ment. In their eyes, therefore, he has never ceased to be the Consul at Bushire and it was, in fact, stated by the Ministry of ^Foreign Affairs, when acknowledging the notification of Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe’s impending departure on leave, that they noted that Major Fowle, “the British Consul at Bushire', would act as Consul General in his absence. It was to the fact that all three appointments were in this way already f filled that my despatch No. 259 of August 12th FZtll] ~~— 'V referred. 3. Nevertheless, if Mai or Fowle is to leave Bushire when Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe returns from leave at the end of September or early in October, (as I conclude is possible), it will be possible to aoply for a Royal Commission, and subsequently an Exequatur, for some other officer in his place. If the Government ofof India consider that this officer should be Captain Cast re 11, rather than any of the officers of the Foreign and Political Department already serving at Bushire, I have no objection and will apply for a Royal Commission on his behalf. I shall also be prepared to ask the Persian Government for first arrival privileges, but in order to do this I must be able to state definitely that Major Fowle is vacating the appointment of Consul at Bushire and that Captain Gastrell is being posted in his place* 4* A copy of this Despatch is being sent to His Majesty f s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs* I have the honour to be.
