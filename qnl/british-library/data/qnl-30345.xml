SL'iJilht &amp; CTj.d. Aoi // ■ . Lat^y Simon has written to the Viceroy about slavery in Qatar * A . and the Political Resident has been asked for his comments, q The slave trade in the Gulf has increased since 1939 for three A- reasons, the shortage of ships of the Rqyal Navy to intercept slave ^oats; the famine in Persia in 1942 and 1943 which made the inhabitants of Persian Mekran ready to sell their children into slavery; and the waiving by H*M.G. of the right of manumission in Jedda, which made the purchase of slaves by Saudi Arabians mofe profitable (the Political Agents at Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat still retain the right of manumission.) The chief slave runner is Mirza bin Barkat of Jask, son of Mir Barkat, notorious at the beginning of this century as a gun runner. In 1942 he was buying slaves in Persian Mekran, taking them to Fujairah on the Bat in ah Coast, whence they were sent to Baraimi and on to Central Arabia. A certain number of these slaves also found their way to Qatar where in 1943 Dohah was becoming a recognised slave mart. Various steps have been taken to suppress the traffic. In 1941 the Sheikh of Fujairah gave the Political Agent at Muscat an undertaking that he would do his best to prevent Mirza bin Barkat from using Fujairah as a base, and the next year was said to have turned him out of his territory. In 1942 the Saudi Arabian Government expressed its willingness to co-operate with H.M.G. in the suppression of the trade in Baluchi slaves and took various measures to carry out their undertaking, but as Ibn Saud is said to purchase a considerable number of slaves himself and his Foreign Minister, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin has been suspected of complicity in the trade in Syrian slaves, it is doubtful how satisfactory these measures may be. In 1943 the Sheikh of Qatar issued a proclamation forbidding the export of slaves from Qatar. It seems probable, however, that little can be done to put down the traffic until the Navy cam spare sufficient suitable ships to patrol the Gulf adequately.

M I have caused enquiries to be made of the Saudi Arabian Government and I am assured that no British protected person or child has been sold as a slave in Mecca. As regards the general question. His Majesty's Government have made every possible effort to suppress the slave traffic in the Persian Gulf which before this war had greatly diminished. But owing to disturbed conditions on the South Persian coast in the last two years there lias unforunately been a slight recrudescence of the smuggling of slaves to the Arabian coast. In the autumn of 191-2 I therefore invited the co-operation of the Saudi Arabian Government in putting a stop to this traffic. I was assured that they would take all possible steps to prevent the smuggling of slaves from overseas into their territory, which was contrary not only to Islamic law but also to the laws passed by the Saudi Arabian Government M .Extract from Bahrein Intelligence Summary No.14.

Reference para 119 of Intelligence Sumnary No.12 of 1942 in which it was reported that Dohah, the capital of Q,atar, was being used as an ent:»cK)ot in the slave traffic. Information has been received from a source believed to be reliable that A . in June the Shaikh of Qatar sent to Nejd, in the charge of his servant Abdullah bin Gaanim al Hajiri, twenty slaves as a gift for Ibn Saud. Five of the slaves were women, young and unmarried, and fifteen were men. He also sent two male slaves and two female slaves as a present to bin Jaluwi. It is reported that these slaves had been for a considerable time in Dohah before they made the journey to Nejd. The chief slave brokers in Dohah are stated to be Ershaid Nejdi and bin Athemin. It is probable that the slave traffic has also the connivance, if not the active support, of Shaikh Saleh al Ivfena, the Shaikh of Qatar's secretary and confidant. 5In the first week of July, immediately after the Political Agent’s visit to Qatar, the Shaikh of Qatar issued a proclamation, copies of which were posted prominently in the Dohah bazaars, forbidding the export of slaves from Qata ^ territory. The mere fact that such a notice was issued appears to confirm the belief that Dohah had become, or was becoming, a recognised slave mart. «EXT ,212 5 AS SECRET Extract frcaii Intelligence Summary of the Political Agent, Bahrain, for the period l6th to 31st March, 1943.

About ten years ago I was with ten other children, nine boys and a girl, bathing on the shore some distance from the town. It was at the end of the simmer. There was a dhow at anchor near where we were bathing. Arabs came from the dhow in a small boat and caught us. They took us to the dhow and tied us up. It was in the afternoon. The Arabs in the boat took us to Qatar; we were about a month in the boat. We arrived at Dohah iprri for two days we were left in the boat. Then we were taken to the house of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim, who bough! all of us. I heard later that I had been bought for Rs.3C0/-. I think that Rs.300/- to 1,000/- was paid for the others as some of the boys were older, about the age I am now. Abdulla bin Jasim gave me to his brother Thani and I was his slave until I escaped from him ten days ago. I was sent out to the desert in the south of Qatar and I did not see the others again; I heard that some had been given away and sent to Nejd. I became a camel boy in the house of Shaikh Thani, brother of Abdulla bin Jasim. I was badly treated and beaten and I asked to be sold to someone else but they would not sell me. I was often hungry. About ten days ago I ran away from Shaikh Thani*s place, '(On Maslan', and came to Dohah. I heard that the Shaikh was deporting all the foreign poor people to Bahrain, Kuwait and elsewhere. I joined the people who were being sent away. Several boats were sent off with paupers and the fares and food were provided by Shaikh Abdulla. I went on board the boat as it was leaving and nobody prevented me. I arrived at Bahrain, and we were caught by the Police^ I did not see the other boys from Llakran because I was a long way off in the desert. The girl is still in the house of Abdulla bin Jasim and her brother is there too; both are younger than me. /ShaikhShaikh Thani has about twenty slaves, men and women; seme of them are light, some black; he has no others from Makran. About a year ago he bought three new slaves, black ones; they were sold to him by some Houlis from Persia. Their names are Sa'edan, Ferraj, Sulaiman. They are all grown up. They prefer being slaves in Thani's house to belonging to the Persian Houlis. These three slaves were in the hands of the auctioneer in Dohah and when they had reached their price the auctioneer informed the Shaikh and he bought th6m. We are given dates and 'lebin' to eat at noon and ric6 with out fat for dinner. ‘Twenty slaves are given one dish and the big ones eat all the food, so I was hungry* The men who have always been slaves do not mind because they become accustomed to being beaten but I was not a'slave and have never become accustomed to this. Bin Thani himself beats the slaves with a stick and if he has not got a stick he uses a stone• Last year I ran away and arrived at Dohah; I wanted to find a boat. The Amir was told that I had escaped and watched the boats so they caught me. I was taken back and kept many months - six months - a prisoner in a tent; then I was let out. I would like to go back to Makran. My father used to be a diver. I am his eldest slu. There were no others. I lived in a stone house in Makran.( 20418 ) Wt. 42001 /P .281 3,000 1/42 A.A E.W.LM.

Your Excellency With reference to your Note to the Minister for Foreign affairs No.135 (1909/1438/3) dated 2 November 1942 I have the honour to communicate to you the reply of the daudi Arabian Government to the message which you received from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressing the concern of the British Government at the continuance of the slave trade across the Persian Gulf and asking for the cooperation of the Saudi Arabian Government by their enforcement of the law prohibiting the importation of slaves from abroad. The Saudi Arabian Government express their perfect willingness to cooperate with the British Government in taking all possible precautions to prevent the smuggling of such slaves into their territory and they express their gratification at the interest the British Government has shown in this matter. The daudi Arabian Government consider this slave traffic to be entirely contr ry to the religious law of Islam just as it is contrary to the laws passed by the Saudi Arabian Government. For thb reason the Saudi Arabian Govern ment is prepared to cooperate with and assist the British Government to the greatest possible extent in this matter although the measures taken by the daudi Arabian Government in thi^Pespect have always been and still are most strict and they have inflicted penalties on a number of persons who have broken these laws. The information possessed by the .'Saudi Arabian Government regarding the route by which slaves are brought to this country indicates that none whatever are brought by sea but it is possible that some may be smuggled in by land by way of the Rub’ al Khali. To ensure the stricter enforcement of the law the Govern ment have issued a new notice which has been published in Nejd and the Eastern coastal districts repeating the prohibition of the traffic in slaves from the Persian Gulf or from any other place either by land or sea -nd announcing that heavy penalties v/ill be inflicted on both the buyer and the seller of slave^or on any merchant or owner of merchandise who sends money by the *' hand of any person to have slaves bought for him. The penalty ^ for infringement of the law consists in the slave being taken from the purchaser and returned to his home without return of the purchase price to the purchaser, in addition a fine is inflicted on the purchaser equivalent to the price paid for the slave and the law breaker is imprisoned for five years. In addition the Government will make a regulation to pro hibit merchants from travelling into the South Eastern parts of the Kingdom unless they are in possession of a pass on which will be endorsed the clauses of the law prohibiting the use of slaves and the traffic in them. The Saudi Arabian Government is ready to cooperate with the British Government in any arrangement which can be agreed upon to control merchants and their movements.

Having been turned out of Fujairah he made his way via Kalba, where he received only a cold welcome, to the Batinah Coast. The Political Agent, Muscv^ low reports that Mirza is on his way back to Kalba and Fujairah as the pe'bple of Liwa and Shinas, acting under pressure from the Muscat Government, refused to allow him to establish himself among them.

Reports have been received from various sources that slaves are being imported into Qatar from the Persian coast for sale to Nejdi slave traffickers. II.H. the Shaikh (-who is an unreliable informant where Qatar affairs are concerned) told the Political Agent that Persian girls could be bought in Qatar for as little as Rs.15 or 20. It is known, of course, that whole families on the Persian Coast are in a sta.te of destitution; and the story goes that the Nakhodas of Persian dhows, with plausible tales of the good conditions existing on the Arab side of the Gulf, persuade parents to send their children in their care to the land of plenty across the sea. When these parties of children and young adults arrive on the Arab side of the Gulf, they are sold like sheep or goats to the highest bidder. After making due allowance for the /inevitabler inevitable element o± exaggeration, there remains a sufficient corpus of evidence to suggest that Dohah, the capital of Qatar, is being, or at least' has been, used as an entrepot in this sickening traffic. . s • . .

I received defintie information that a shipload of about 170 pPersians arrived at Qatar some tv/o months; and subsequently I heard, though not so definitely, that a number of these had been impressed into slavery and exported to Nejd. 4. Stories which I heard in June were reported in n n ^. para 119 of my I ntelligence Slmma ry No. 12. 5 I asked Belgrave if he could obtain ayy information on the subject and I enclose a copy of a note which he has sent me. Belgrave assures me that the.information contained in his note was obtained from a reliable source. '-yM i**!t*~H v after my viset on Ju ly 2nd-3rd the Shaikh of Qatar issued a notice, which was put up in the Dohah bazaars, that the export of slaves from Qatar was strictly forbidden. During my visit to Qatar I did not mention the question of traffic in slaves to the Shaikh. I did however make a reference to the subject in conversation with Saleh al Mana the Sheikhas Secretary. This gentleman might well be involved in the slave traffic and I think it likely, since he is particularly intelligent, that he took my reference to the subject to be a warning. 7„ From my talks on this subject with various people I do not think that the importation of slaves into Qatar direct from the Persian Coast is common. I believe the trade to be mainly, if not exclusively, from the coast of Persian Baluchistan to the Oman Coast and thence, by coastal dhow or overland, to the Trucial Coast and Qatar and onwards into Ne jd. Though we can do something to interfere T dth this traffic I do not think it will be eradicated until the Saudi Arabian jminnd for—ceases. -Co. i*OL. * Yours sincerely, INDIA ut -F1CE Sd/- Ei B.

In his despatch No.161 (2765/1437/16) of the 14th November, 1939, Sir Reader Bullard reported that in recent years Baluchis had been introduced into Saudi Arabia as slaves in considerable numbers, and pointed out that this practice was contrary not only to the Saudi Slavery Regulations of 1936 but also to Islamic law. But Sir Reader Bullard recommended that as the trade from Persian Baluchistan had decreased, further information should be awaited before any approach was made to Ibn Saud in the matter. 3. You will see from the enclosures to this despatch that there has been a recrudescence Of this traffic owing to the state of disorder prevailing on the South Persian coast, and that the eventual destination of the slaves is said to be Nejd. Unless therefore you see objection, T shall be glad if you will draw the attention of the Saudi Arabian Government to tnese reports and say that His Majesty’s Government nave been concerned at the information which has reached them from time to time of tne continuance of this traffic. While His Majesty’s Government will do all in their oower to suppress it on tne high seas and will urge the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Fumairah to stop the trade in their territories, they expect ITTe Saudi Arabian Government for their part to prevent the exploitation of Nejd as a market by strict enforcement oi their own Slavery Regulations.

His The The His with reference to dated the 5th MayThere has recently been some cence of the traffic in slaves from the Persian to the .arab coat Persian G-ulf and the Gulf of Oman* This is probably due ir the decline in security in South-east Persia which has |^?) the dethronement of Reza Shah;and in part to the fact that in waryC/ &gt; Navy is unable to exercise so much vigilance as usual over /si9£ in these waters. On the Persian cc^t the principal centre of—one w’ade in slaves seems to be the district round JasK and Ras-al-Kuh in Persian Baluchistan, where the chief offender is said to be Mirza Bin Barkat. Prom there kidnapped Baluchis are shipped to villages bn Batinah coast which are in Muscat territory but not under the effective control of the Sultan; or to Fujairah, a small independent Sheikhdom which is not in treaty relations with H.M.G. It appears that the slaves are eventually taken to Saudi Arabia where they may be exchanged for arms (compare the Political Resident’s letter of April 5th last at Ext. 2920/42). A report, dated December 5th, A941, by the Political Agent at Bahrein of a visit to the Sheikh of Fujairah in connection with this traffic will be found at Ext. 1566/42. The Political Resident’s letter below forwards a report from the Political agent at Muscat describing this traffic. Colonel Hay is inclined to think that it has somewhat increased in recent months, and that it may develop sti ll fu rther if steps are not taken to suppress it. He then discusses what^step^ythes^/should be. We may agree with him that in present circumstances action by the Persian authorities in so remote a region cannot be expected. With regard to action at sea, it is not clear why the Political Resident makes a proviso about the search of Persian dhows; the correspondence at Ext. 2046/42 shows that both H.M. Minister at Tehran and the F.O. have agreed to the Political Resident’s proposal (which specifically mention^the slave trade) that such ships may be searched even inside Persian territorial waters. as regards action in Muscat and Fujiah, the Political Resident implies that he is doing or will do everything possible (Colonel Prior's letter of July 51st I 94 J 0 at PZ. 486A/40 gives a colourful account of the difficulties of taking effective action on the Batinah coast). There remains the question of action in Saudi Arabia. Here Colonel Hay refers to the most recent despatch on this subject from H.M. Minister at Jedda - dated November 14th, 1939 (see PZ.7839/39)* At that time the Minister was hopeful that the traffic had been checked. He recommended, however, that if it should revive 'it might be advisable to give Ibn. Baud a friendly v/arning about Baluchis, on the ground that their enslavement, which we should assume to be unknown to him, is contrary to his own laws, and that if the facts came to the knowledge of the Persian Government the effect might be as wounding to the dignity of His Majesty as it would be regMtted by His Majesty's friends, the British Government.” It is proposed to ask the F.O. to take action on the lines recommended by the Political Resident, and a draft for this purpose is submitted. b/t rLo £:eU O^JL * ^ hJ: l t- /IhUJl There has recently been some recrudescence of the traffic in slaves from the Persian to the iirab coast of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, This is probably due in part to the decline in security in South-east Persia which has followed the dethronement of Reza Shah;and in part to the fact that in war time the Navy is unable to exercise so much vigilance as usual over shipping in these waters* On the Persian cdjst the principal centre of the trade in slaves seems to be the district round JasK and Ras-al-Kuh in Persian Baluchistan, where the chief offender is said to be Mirza Bin Barkat* Prom there kidnapped Baluchis are shipped to villages on Batinah coast which are in Muscat territory but not under the effective control of the Sultan; or to Fujdrah, a small independent Sheikhdom which is not in treaty relations with H.M.G.

So mucla ink hag been spilt (r^- over this matter that I hesitate to add to it the discuss ions have ascended so far into the Empyrean that it is high time they were brought to earth. In the first place, I agree with the view tentatively expressed in paragraph 3 of your letter, viz. t-Lat no further communication to the Sultan is required, and I do not propose to send him one. £he discussions up to date have not, I am afraid, taken realities into account. Muscat has about 300 miles of coast admirably adapted for the slave trade, and to demand that the Sultan shall extend a close administration over it is as practical as te expecting the Cromer police to prevent small boys from committing nuisances between the North Foreland and Scarborough. As the Sultan extends his control with the aid of our subsidy, he will naturally do what he can to suppress the traffic but he admitted iFowle*s demi-official letter No.625-S of 10th July 1939 para 8, copy to Government of India under Printed Letter No.626-S of same date) that M as you are aware the Batineh coast is extensive and there Arc places far from habitation and the surveillance of the Walis.

So far as I am aware Fowle never toured the Batineh and I think he underestimataed the difficulty of checking the | trade* Prom Shines to Birkah it is one long beach with a huge belt of palms behind it and the Jebel Akhdar behind that, and in places the villages are practically adjoining. the pcpulat— .J ion is largely negroid, with a sprinkling of Baluchis, and I would defy anyone to say who is oond and who is free. When j. -was a v 1 t,R kaso December 1 me o spoice with two oodles of Persian ^sxucnis* They were utterly destitute, and nsd lext their country to get food to eat. Such people may at any moment find the security of slavery preferable to the starvation of freedom, and sell themselves or their children to a caravan bound for Baraimi* Guedalla says of the Great Duke in hio ’'Wellington” (p.257) *He has been startled whilst in England by 'the degree of frenzy” felt in this admirable cause* • 1 feel tnat our”frenzy” should be at least well informed. At the moment the trade is at a low ebb, but it Y/ill 4. require the constant supervision of the Political Agent to see that it remains so. The suppression of the slave trade arouses much sympathy, but little actual support, in fact it is actually considered to be sufficient for the Havy to 'do” something. The Navy are no longer available, and a little practical help would be welcome* In the first place the Political Agent must keep in close touch and be fully informed and to do this he must tour this coast frequently, which he can only do in a launch. For forty years the attempts of this Residency to secure a seagoing launch for Muscat ha^ e struck on the reefs of 'financial stringency” and the rocks of 'Allocation of consular expenditure in the Persian Gulf” (except / for ak &gt; JL • * -* ^ 4 c&gt; 6 4 i s 19 4- 0 J for a brief interlude efter tne V/ar when l tfJJ the service of s derelict steem tug), but yet another effort is now being made. If v.e ere to tackle this trade seriously the Political Agent must be given every facility for frequent touring for it is only by this means that he will know what is going on and it is only then that we may hope to rid the -^atineh of its sinister reputation.

In so far as the subject matter relates to ray Consular districts* the enquiries I hare made rereal that the traffic in slares from Iranian Baluchistan still exlsta* though to s much less extent than formerly. 3. My information is that occasional shipments of hurarin cargo* chiefly young girls and boys* ere made from sheltered creeks along the Biysban coast between Kurgan (Khargun'; ) end Bahtoadl* subordinate customs posts to Mlnab end Jask respectively. 4. The ocrscais responsible for this truffle are Beshakardls* inhabitants of the district of the seme florae to the east of the Biyaban coast* end the Tehlrsels* s tribe which ranges between the district of Bsshakerd and the coast. 6. The Tahlrsals are undoubtedly aided in their nefarious trade by the feet that the Biyaban Aranieh guards arc recruited solely from this tribe. It is feirly certain that some of these guards must be aware of this business and it is unlikely that ell the government officers at Mlnab end Jask ere entirely ignorant of it. But the traffic is sufficiently remunerative to enable the traders to psy for oonnlvaije. 6. Vthlle the traflckers of Iranian Baluchistan end the officers who connive at it are to be condemned for the pert they play* it has to be admitted that these unwholesome practices would cease if Saudi Arabia did not create the demand.

A fight ensued in which one of the Road Guards was killed. The slavers escaped leaving behind trieir Baluchi captives as well as several rifles. I hr ve the honour, etc., (3g&lt; • ) J. C* w.

They agree generally but suggest that the last two paragraphs might be redrafted in order to make a reference to the various subsidies and war material which have been promised to the Sultan of Iviuscat for the purpose, amongst other things, of assuring him that he should be in a position to maintain internal security. A redraft has accordingly been made of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft letter and is attached below the draft to the Political Resident. Some time has hov/ever elapsed since Sir Trenchard Fowle wrote his letter of the 10th July ano. the situation has changed considerably with the outbreak of war and with the promise of assistance which the Sultan has had from us in return for giving us the necessary facilities in his territory. We know from the A Resident’s telegram of the 1st December that the Sultan has furnished the Political Agent with a statement of the security measures which he proposes to take and it may well be^ now that he has got the money^that these measures will include action against the Baluchis of some sort, e.g. deportation or disarmament. Consequently Sir Trenchard Fowle 1 s draft letter to the Sultan may not be altogether appropriate.

T o. 161 (2765/1437/16) Confidential. British Legation, Jedda. j j November 14th., 1939. J ir My Lord, In two despatches which I have had the honour to address to Your Lordship this year I have reported on the introduction of slaves into Saudi Arabia from Baluchistan# The references are: No. 44 of March 9th. (5L5/1437/3) and No. 99 of May 30th. (1195/1437/9). I am now able to submit some more information, most of it gained during my recent visit to Riyadh. 2. My informants in Riyadh were Dr. Dame, the .American doctor who was formerly attached to the mission in Bahrain but is now employed by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, Mrs. Dame, and an American mission ary doctor, Dr. (Miss) Barney. All of these informants, and particularly the ladies, are well acquainted with the domestic life of the royal and other leading families in Riyadh, and their information is of unusual value. On the other hand, since they live at Bahrain, and since the slave traffic across the Persian Gulf is under the close observation of the political officers on that side of Arabia, the information I report, which was gained in the course of a couple of social conversations, is subject to correction out of the closer studies of the Political Resident at Bushire and his subordinate officers. 3. According to my informants, many Baluchis have / been The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G., j?. c.Rs. 50 ■been introduced into Riyadh as slaves during the last two or three years. That they are newly-enslaved persons must he evident, since many talk only Baluchi when they arrive. One woman related how she and her child (or children) were stolen from near their village at some distance from the coast and brought across the sea to the Arab coast. Persian Baluch istan is believed to be the main source of supply, but some at least of the slaves are shipped from Gwadur, and they, if captured in Persian Baluchistan, must have been brought across part of British Baluchistan. 4. On my return to Jedda I found some particulars which had just been recorded by Saiyid Lai Shah, the Indian Vice-Consul, who was then visiting Mecca and Taif. Saiyid Lai Shah I regard as a very reliable witness. Here are some of the details he gives. A Baluchi girl now a slave in Medina is stated to be a daughter of Ali Khan son of Barkat Khan. Barkat Khan was said by Saiyid Lai Shah’s informant to be one of the prominent opponents of Riza Shah at the beginning of the latter’s reign; but on the other hand, in a report from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to be quoted later in this despatch, Barkat Khan is given as the name of one of the leading slave traders. There is a young girl speaking only Baluchi in a house opposite that of the Indian Vice-Consul at Jedda. Jask is mentioned as one of the ports of shipment of slaves. It is alleged that the Saudi Arabian Government levy a duty of fifty riyals a head on imported slaves. At Taif at one time during the past summer there were thirty-two slaves for sale. Of one batch of twenty-four slaves, mostly women and children, sent to Riyadh, eight died of hardship on the way. There is a rumour that Riza Shah has protested to Ibn Saud against this slave traffic. / 5,5# One of my previous sources of information has been Muhammad Sadiq (’’Personalities', No. 83). As the King o chauffeur he is v/ell informed, and being himself of Baluchi origin and a decent man he much dislikes this slave tra.i lc. He recently bought a Baluchi slave-ooy, set him iree and took him to India with him. He gave His Majesty’s Legation these particulars about this boy. Name, Shah Murad. Father (ohamba) and Mother (Muski) said to be living at (?Bangolan), near Jask. Is now about thirteen years of age. About two years ago, while he was playing with his brothers Husainag and Kaidi, they were all three captured by three Baluchis, Packed into a dhow with thirteen or fourteen other children and covered with a sail they were taken to some port on the Arab coast, whence they were taken to Baraimi: from there they travelled by camel to Hasa and on by car to Riyadh. The two brothers are said to be still in Riyadh. 6. The Baluchi slave has long been heard of as a feature of the pearling trade on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf. Nor is it news that Persian Baluchistan is a source of supply for slaves, and that there are slavers on the Trucial Coast* I cannot find any recent references in the Persian print about the slave traffic from Persian Baluchistan, but in a despatch addressed to the Secretary of State on November 9th., 1929 (No. 119 in the bound volume of print Part XXVI for July to December 1929), His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran transmitted a despatch from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, reporting the existence of a regular traffic in Persian Baluchis with the Muscat coast, extending to perhaps two hundred a year. ; hat is notable is that during the last few years Baluchis have been introduced into Saudi Arabia in considerable numbers. This is contrary / toto the Saudi Slavery Regulations of 1936 ? which forbids the importation of slaves 'by sea. If newly-enslaved persons are imported by land from some Arab state on the Trucial Coast ? as seems probable, that is still contrary to the regulations which say that it is absolutely prohibited . . . to import slaves into the Kingdom of Saudi Araoia b^- land routes, unless the importer produces a Government document confirming that the person imported was recognised as a slave in the country from which he is imported at the time of the publication” of the regulation. It is of course possible that false certificates are provided, and that the traffic is even recognised to the extent of levying customs dues (as the Indian vice-Sonsul hears is being done) on the human imports, but I think it more likely that the slaves are not brought in through customs posts and that the Saudi authorities therefore find it easy to wink at the traffic. Ibn Saud seems to know everything that goes on in all parts of his dominions, hov/ever remote, and it is incredible that he should not be aware that he often has in his own palace as slaves women and children who perhaps a few months or even v/eeks before were living in freedom in a country with which he maintains friendly diplomatic relations. Perhaps he does make some effort to enforce his own regulation. The Indian chauffeur declares that the King has in fact set free some forty persons who had been kept in slavery in violation of che regulations, but such Baluchis, when set free, ought to be repatriated, and there is certainly no news of that. 7. The enslavement of Baluchis is not only contrary to Saudi law but also, I believe, to Islamic law, since they are, at least nominally, Moslems. This Islamic principleis also infringed, according to Dr. Dame, Dy the existence in Riyadh of slave concubines described as Yemenis and obviously of Arab blood. It seems probable that the diminu tion or cessation in the supply of slaves from Abyssina that has resulted from the Italian conquest has created so strong a demand that no principles are allowed to stand in the way. /hen the rulers set a bad example there is little hope of improvement. The Xing has had several children by slave women. His favourite consort, Umm Mansur, who died in 1938, was one of those unfortunate victims of the Turkish atroci ties against the Armenian race during the great war. Nasir, an ill-conditioned youth who caused the death of two women last year by giving them methylated spirit to drink during a debauch and who has now been given the post of Governor cf the town of Riyadh because ^1 understand) it is not important enough for such of his brothers as Muhammad or Khalid, is the son of a slave*-woman of low origin, as to the Amir Saud, n is palace, according to Dr. and Mrs. Dame, is swarming with black children he has had by slave women. -here is some evidence that slaves have even been supplied from Syria. There was a report (l think from the Political Agent at Kuwait, though I cannot trace it now) that Shaikh Yusuf Yasin, on one of his journeys through Kuwait, had a slave girl with him, and I gathered that the Dames had some suspicion of Shaikh Yusuf on this score. It would of course be possible for Shaikh Yusuf to import women ior the Saudi royal family without transgressing any law, human or divine, that he recognises. He has only to marry a girl in Syria and to divorce her on arrival in Riyadh; there she could easily be constrained to marry one of the princes, who in a few weeks or even days would divorce herand pass her on, always in accordance with Moslem law, to a younger brother or to some friend. Suspicion amounting almost to certainty attaches to Dr. Midhat Shaikh-al Ardh, a young Syrian who is doctor to the King’s ladies. When I was in Riyadh in November 1938 he had just returned from Syria where he had gone to get married. I wondered why this was regarded as a joke among the royal entourage, to whom marriage cannot be a novelty. The matter was explained during my visit this yeaf when I found that Dr. Midhat had again gone to Syria to get married, and learned from Dr. Dame that this was about the tenth time 1 '. Dr. J'lidhat, who arrived in Saudi Arabia some years ago as a penniless refugee, is now a rich man, and it is unlikely that his wealth is due solely to his medical skill. That it is not unreasonable to suspect him of acting as pimp to the royal family is estab lished Dy a case ior which Dr. Dame believes that he has ample evidence. The mother of Dr. Midhat rescued or at any rate took in during the Armenian massacres during the Great War a little Armenian girl who grew up in the household. After one of his numerous marriages in Syria Dr. Midhat said that he would take this girl with him to Riyadh, as maid to his new wife.• To evade suspicion she was entered on his passport as his sister. On arrival in Riyadh he handed over the most unwilling girl oo the King, and after serving as concubine, first to the King and then in quick succession to two or three other men, she was fortunate enough to die. This Dr. Midhat talks good French, has a medical degree, accompanied the Amir Faisal to England for the Silver Jubilee, and does not look more like a white slaver than most Syrians. 9. It is only a few months ago that I reported to / YourYour Lordship, in iny despatch Mo, 95 (1225/1439/19) dated young June 3rd. the rescue of a/Sudanese girl who had been sold into slavery in Mecca and kept in slavery for three years. There was little doubt that she had been sold by a Sudanese woman who brought her on the pilgrimage, and the authorities seized upon this to disclaim responsibility. Not only did they not express any regret, but they insistently demanded the recovery of the thirty gold pounds which, they argued, had been extracted from the purchaser under false pretences. Slavery is a question on which the Saudi authorities are very sensitive, perhaps because of the conflict between a practice authorioed by the precept and the example of their Prophet and the general opinion of the whole Christian world and of most of the Moslem world also. They would therefore be inclined to say, as to the traffic in Baluchis, that the authorities in the territories from which these people are alleged to come, ought to suppress the traffic at its source, that the British warships in the Persian Gulf should be more efficient in preventing the running of the slaves across to the Arab bide of the Gull, and that but for the support and participation of the Arab states for which His Majesty’s Government are responsible, the traffic could not be carried on at all. And if the report which I have quoted at the end of paragraph 6 is correct, Ibn Saud might be able to claim that he sets free immediately any slave of whose wrongful enslavement he becomes aware. 10. There is some slight hope that the traffic in slaves from Persian Baluchistan has been checked. While this despatch was being written I received a copy of the annual report on Iran which relates in paragraphs 206 ff. the conclusion of a successful campaign in November 1938 against v / malcontentsmalcontents in r'ersian Baluchistan. This tends to corroborate an otherwise unsupported statement made by Sadiq, the King’s chaui.four, in October 1958 ? that for about a year the trade irom that source nad definitely decreased and that so far as ac knew no fresh slaves had reached Riyadh from the east since about February of this year. Should it be found that this information is incorrect, or should the traffic, although checked, revive again, it might be advisable to give Ibn Saud a friendly warning about the Baluchis, on the ground that ulioir enslavement, which we should assume to be unknown to him, is contrary to his own laws, and that if the facts came to the knowledge of the Iranian Government the effect might be as wounding to the dignity of His Majesty as it would be regretted Dy His Majesty’s friends, the British Government. -r 1 or the present we can wait and see. 11, I am forwarding copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India (2766/1437/16, the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (2767/ 1437/16), the Political Agent at Muscat (No.2768/1437/16), the Political Agent at Bahrain (No.2769/1437/16) and to His 'njesty’s Minister at Tehran (No. 2770/1437/16).

October 1939. 345. Some information about slavery in Riyadh has been obtained from unimpeachable sources. It is confirmed that very considerable numbers of Baluchis are being introduced as slaves. That these are newly made slaves must be evident to their owners since many know no Arabic when they arrive. One woman related how she and her child (or children) were stolen from near their village at some distance from the coast and brought across the Persian Gulf. It is said that Persian Makran is the main source of supply; but as it is also said that the slaves are usually shipped from Gwadur they must at least pass through British Baluchistan. It is of course no new thing that human beings should be stolen from Persian Baluchistan and sold into slavery on the Arab side of the Gulf, but what seems to be new is the introduction of such slaves into the interior of Saudi Arabia in considerable.numbers. Baluchis are not the only persons introduced as slaves in contravention of Ibn Saud’s regulations and (in that they are Moslems) in violation of Moslem law. Women described as Yemenis and obviously Arab are found as slaves. But the canker is spreading, and Syrians are being introduced. Shaikh Yusuf Yasin is said to have had a hand in this. It is suggested that he and other Syrians marry attractive girls in Syria and on arrival divorce them and hand them over to the King or one of the princes. But the most atrocious story, which appears to be true in its main outline, is this. One of the prosperous figures in Riyadh is Dr. Midhat Shaikh al Ardh, doctor to the King f s ladies, who arrived as a penniless refugee not soso many years ago. He went to Syria to get married, and ■brought back as maid to his new wife an Armenian girl who had apparently been picked up by his mother during the massacres of the Great War and brought up in his house in Damascus. On arrival in Riyadh he made the King a present of tt 3 most unwilling girl whc, after serving as concubine first to the King and then to two or three other men, happily died. This Dr. Midhat who talks French well and accompanied the Amir Saud to England for the Silver Jubilee, does not look more liKe a white slaver than most Syrians.Any further communication “should be addressed to:— The Secretary of the Admiralty, London, S.W.l. quoting “ M* 07622/39 on the outside of the envelope as well as in the text.

In view, however, of the developments in the relationship between H*M* Government and the Sultan of Muscat which has occurred since India Office letter mentioned above was written. My Lords would suggest that the proposed communication should be redrafted to take these developments into account. In particular they would suggest that some reference should be made to the various subsidies which H*M. Government have agreed to pay to the Sultan and to the war material which they have agreed to supply him for the purpose, amongst other things, of assuring that he should be in a position to maintain internal security. My Lords woujd/suggest that it might be pointed out to the Sultan that internal security is understood by H.M. Government to include the frustration by disamament or otherwise of the activities of the Baluchis. With reference The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, S. W. 1.With reference to Sir Trenchard Powle*s proposal in paragraph 13 of his despatch dated July 10th that approaches should also he made on the subject of slave trading to the Persian and Saudi Arabian Governments, I am to acquaint you that My Lords concur with the opinion expressed in the last paragraph of India Office letter of August 9th to the Foreign Office, that an approach to the Persian Government would seem to be somewhat pointless in view of the fact that the slaves concerned appear to leave Persian territory as free men. On the other hand. My Lords see no objection to an approach to the Saudi Arabian Government with whose territory the market for Baluchi slaves appears to be extensive, the more so as Ibn Saud engaged in the Treaty of 1927 to do everything within his power to suppress the slave traffic. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am.

Please see the Political Resident’s letter at P.Z.5262. The letter reports two cases of slave trading on the Trucial Coast, and describes the action taken by the Political Resident. The problem presented is similar to that presented in the Political Resident’s previous letter on the slave trading in Muscat (vide the submission at P.Z.4541/39, on which action is still in progress). In both cases the reported instances of slavery were few, and the question is how far the Political Resident should be expected to go in bringing pressure to bear on the responsible Rulers to check slavery in their territory. The really responsible parties are not the Sheikhs or the Sultan, so much as Iran end Saudi-Arabia. In making representations to the Iranian and Saudi-Iranian Governments - a course of action which is at present under consideration, see P.Z. 53 62/39 - H.M.G. must be able to show that they have discharged whatever duties they have in the matter. On the other hand care must be taken to avoid threatening the Sheikhs with severer action than the Political Resident is really in a position to adopt. In the present instance the Political Resident enumerates possible sanctions he might use to compel more vigorous measures by the Sheikhs. These sanctions are (a) The stoppage of H.M.G.’s good offices, which include the refusal of travel papers. (b) Seizure of the pearling fleet of the offending Sheikhdoms. (c) The bombardment of the house of the offending Sheikh. (a) is hardly a sufficient deterrent; (b) is too (6610) Wt.25956/235 10,000 9/38 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd.

The Political Resident proposes to adopt none of these measures, though he is prepared to refuse travel papers if occasion arises. On the other hand he has not ignored any actual instances of slave trading which have occurred. He has written to the offending Sheikhs of Ajman and Ras-al-Khaimah. He has reminded the former, who is the more culpable of the two, of his treaty obligations, and stated that he has incurred his displeasure.

(3) • With regard to ^c) * in this connection please see JLifCf paragraph 7 of my letter Jao.210-S of the 18th March 1939. in addition to what I said therein there is the further strong argument that the present juncture, when at any moment we may ( k', ^ kk p- * nY0 ^ ve&lt; * a raajor war, aiid may have to ask for the co- q A, v . ;u (« operation of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs in various ways* is not a suitable one for taking punitive action against the Shaikhs, or indeed disgruntling them by pressing them too hard over any particular issue. There is also the fact that at the same time that a slave case occurs in any particular Trucial Coast Shaikhdora, we often require some facility or other from the Shaikh of that Shaikhdom, ^see paragraph 6 of my letter of 18th March 1939). In the present instance of Has al Khaimah, too, we may require air facilities from him, (vide paragraph3- 7 (2) of my .Express Latter x^o.0/240 of the 28th June 1939). 4. With these considerations in mind we must it seems to me treat these Trucial Coast slave trade cases purely on grounds of expediency, as suggested in paragraph 8 of my letter of 18th March, at all events until the international situation is much quieter. 1 assume that His Majesty v s Government take the same view, vide India Office letter ho. P.Z.3188/39 of the 12th June 1939 in reply to my letter just quoted. 5. In these circumstances I think the only policy to pursue is to go easy with the Shaikhs over the few slave trade cases that do arise. At the same time 1 am not ignor~ ing these cases completely and am writing to the Shaikh of Ajman reminding him of his Treaty obligations to His Majesty^ Government, and that he has incurred my displeasure V 1 have not brought His Majesty t s Government into the matter). I am also writing to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah in less severe terms since, though it appears evident that he connived at the Trading, he did return the woman. In these letters I have made no mention of the stoppage of His Majesty's Govern ment’s good offices, but 1 am asking Weightman to instruct the Residency Agent, Sharjah, that should the Shaikhs of Ajman or Ras al Khaimah or any of their subjects ask for travel papers, before the issue of these i should be consult ed. Whether travel papers are then given in any particular case can depend on circumstances prevailing at the time. 1 am sending a cop£ of this letter to Caroe and Weightman. * *aent under Printed letter Uo.C/342 of the • 13th August, 1939.UAL ^ r .' i » Ci 5477 Copy of meawrandua Ho.Vl-Trf36).7e91/G., dated the © 4th August 1939, from tbe Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General, Resident and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, Subject:- Importation slaves from Reference jour memorandum No, F-87-H/39, dated the 11th April 1939. 2.

But it is also not improbable that such slaves are brought from Iran to Gwadur and from there shipped to the Hedjaz and Riyadh. The worst offenders in this traffic amongst the Iranian Itekrani Baluch tribes are the Bar, Jadgals, Hots and Rinds while this has long been a common practice with the Danadas (or freed slaves).

P.Z. 4541/39. Department. It is satisfactory that further enquiries have failed to substantiate the reports of slave trading from British Baluchistan or of traffic by sea to Debai. It appears that cases of slave trading on the Trucial coast are few in number. From Persian Baluchistan, on the other hand, it is reported that as many as 50 Baluchis a month are brought over to the Batineh coast, most of whom find their way to Saudi Arabia as slaves, via Baraimi. As regards the reply to the Sultan’s letter, it is no doubt true that this is an internal matter which the Sultan himself must manage for himself and Sir Trenchard Fowle is clearly right in his opinion that H.M.G. should not offer the Sultan any material assistance to defeat the Baluchis who are causing him so much trouble^quite apart from their activities to do with the slave traffic. But at first sight, it seems a little ungracious on our part, having I+4CZ+ uLJL 1 reminded him of his obligation to suppress the traffic in slaves in his territory, to refuse to assist him with our advice when he asks for it. The Sultan has already been hurt by the Resident’s letters on the subject of slave trading, and it is to be feared that he may feel a little aggrieved by the unhelpful attitude of the Resident’s draft letter, and in particular paragraph 5. There is, however, much force in the arguments in paragraphs 10 and 11 of Sir Trenchard Fowle’s letter of the 10th July. The Sultan is an independent ruler who has a Slave Trading Treaty with us and he is not entitled to expect our assistance in his own domestic difficulties. In any/any case, the only advice that we could very well give him as regards the Baluchis would he that he should act with caution and make quite sure before taking action that he is in a strong enough position to carry it through successfully. The disadvantage of this however, as the Resident points out, is that it might enable the Sultan to use the excuse in the future that he had been quite ready to take forceful action but we had discouraged him. It seems wiser therefore on the whole to leave him to decide the question for himself.-y AdOO 3Hi K' &lt;5. 1 + (7- Gonfidential The Residency, » D.O.iio*625-S Bushire. the 10th July 1939 | nr r r * \S ctceLn, ^ c c L Could you please refer to correspondence ending with India Office letter Eo.P.Z. 3188/39 dated the 12th June 1939, with enclosure, on the subject of slave trading in Oman and the Trucial Coast. _ 2.

Weightman adds that having been for some time Political Agent in Kalat, and having made several journeys / R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E., M.C. The India Office, London. ^HCd. POL. OEPt. f ?UUl 939 j . jNDlA OFFICE *journeys in Kalat (Mekran)* iie is convinced that the information given to His Majesty^ Minister in Jedda as to slaves being kidnapped in British Baluchistan and sent from Gwadur to Debai is entirely incorrect* He thus confirms Hickinbothanks view given in my Sxpress Letter PISM No.511-S of the 31st May 1939* AM Aw^aU- ^ (U. -Um n intr) 4 * in regard to (a). I do not say that isolated cases of slave trading do not occur on the Trucial Coast, in fact they do, but all our information shows that the main 'slave route' (if it can be called such) is from Persian Baluchistan via the Batineh Coast to Baraimi Oasis and thence to Saudi Arabia. This information consists of a report from Howes who visited Baraimi in December 1938 with the Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration party (see paragraph 3 of my lett er Ho*30-3 of the 9th January 1939), the report of a special agent sent by Weightman to the Trucial Coast interior as well as from local enquiries (vide paragraph 2 of ray letter No*C/65 of the 17th Feb ruary 1939), the result of local enquiries by Hickinbotham and the report of a special agent he sent to the Batineh coast (vide paragraph 7 of enclosure to rpy iExpress Letter Ho.511^3 of 31st May). I am therefore quite satisfied that the reports given to His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda Debai are not correct* On the other hand it is quite correct that slaves are taken into Saudi Arabia, but from Baraimi not Debai. The reason why Debai is so frequently mentioned is I imagine that it is the largest and best known town on the Trucial Coast, and doubtless up to some years ago was the centre of such slave trade as existed*3* 5* In continuation of ay Express Letter So &gt;538-3 of the 5th June 1939, I enclose herewith a translation of two letters. Nos* 194 and 196 dated the 20 th June 1939, which I have received from the Sultan* As you will see, he seems rather hurt by the two letters. Nos*508-3 of the 31st May and 537-3 of the 5th June, which I have addressed him on the subject of slave trading in his territory* As you know he is a personal friend of mine, and of late in connection with his visit to England has been made much of by His Majesty f s Government* I think therefore that he resents any implied criticism of the xeakness of his administration under which slave tiadiiig can go on in his territory. With regard to the none* of ny letters which he mentions X think that this was perfectly polite, and in regard to the matter the in formation on which this was based was trustworthy. Personally I would much prefer going on being “nice* to His Highness, but business is business and unless we press this point of slave trading reasonably hard we are not likely to get much results out of him* In this con nection I note from the enclosure to India Office letter under reference that the Foreign Office are of opinion that every possible effort should be made to put a stop to the slave trade not only on the Trucial Coast but also in Muscat territory* I enclose herewith a copy of my reply. No.624-3 dated the 10th July 1939, to his letter which I have made rather long as I did not wish to let any of the points he made go by default* 6 . /6 * With regard to Chaicar hin Murad (vide paragraphs 4 - 6 of the Sultan's letter, and correspondence ending with my Express Letter No»C/85 dated the 21st iebruary 1939)* It is quite true that Watts did not inform me that the Sultan had put a price on the head of this slave dealer and pirate* In paragraph 4 of his letter His Highness complains that it was the calling of the sloop at Suwaiq which put Chaicar on his guard. My own opinion is that the Sultan had little or no proppect of getting Murad apprehended, that it was the arrival of the ship, combined with the Sultan's offer of a reward, which frightened Murad into believing that combined British-Muscati operations were contemplated, against him, and which made him leave for Mekran. In my letter, however, to the Sultan I have let him have the credit of making Murad leave Muscat territory. In any case Murad from first to last pursued his activities in His Highness's territory unchecked for some years, which does not say much for the Muscat administration in those parts. Incidentally our information was to the effect that he and Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad (see below) were confederates, and that at one time he had his headquarters near the Shaikh's village. 7 * With regard to Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad (paragraphs 10 and 11 of the Sultan's letter). Watts did not inform me of the Sultan's letter Ho.125 of the 24th October 1938 as to Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad - a copy of which I enclose. I do not think, however, that /-5. Cm that I would have worded my letters to the Sultan any differently even if I had received this information. Hilal f s isolated action in rescuing some Baluchis occurred some nine months ago, and both before ana since that incident we received information which threw considerable suspicions on him. These suspicions have evidently been shared by the Sultan who, as he states in paragraph 10 of his letter *We have been frightening and threatening him on account of the rumours about him', and who in the course of the last month, vide his letter No. 196 of the 20th June, took the strong step of im prisoning some of Hilal*s followers. 8 . With regard to the subject as to whether slave trading takes place in his territory. The Sultan is not very consistent. He sayst 'We do not admit that slave trading does take place openly or secretly in our country.' (paragraph 12 of his letter), and elsewhere he says* 'as you sire awsore the Batinah Coast is extensive and there are places fax from habitation and the sur veillance of the Walls. The Baluchis who come land at these places.' (paragraph 7 of his letter). • 9 . In regard to the measures tfiich he proposes to take to stop the traffic in slaves (paragraph 16 of his letter). Briefly, he has relinquished the idea of disarming the Baluchis - vide paragraph 3 of my Express * / Letter No.538-S of the 5th June 1939, and now proposes preventing their entry and deporting those already in residence. In paragraph 17 of his letter he points out that /that he will cause his tribes* who will be assisted by his Government* to take action against the Baluchis* that he expects fighting to take place and asks whether we will help by punitive action* He concludes in paragraphs 19 and 20 by asking my opinion on his proposals. 10. These are questions which I cannot of course reply to without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government. Jty own opinion is that the deportation of the Baluchis will prove as difficult as the previous plan of disarming them* and I expect that the Sultan is right in saying that this cannot be carried out without hostilities. I am not of opinion that His Majesty’s Government should promise the Sultan assistance in this matter* which would involve naval and/or air action and which is an internal matter which the Sultan must deal, with himself. Briefly* the position is that the Sultan is juridically an independent sovereign who has a Slave Treaty with us* and that on excellent information we have drawn his attention to the fact that slave trading goes on in his territory. It is now his business to deal with it as best he can. 11* Hor do I think that His Majesty’s Government should express an opinion on the merits of the Sultan’s proposal to deal with the Baluchi problem which* as in dicated in paragraph 2 of my Express Letter Ho .53 8-S of the 5th June 1939 and paragraph 15 of the Sultan’s letter* quite apart from the slave question is a source of embar rassment to the Muscat Government. If we approve of the Sultan’s proposals it will encourage him to persist in asking /asking for assistance from His Majesty^ Government^ and if matters go wrong» and the Baluchis get the better of it, he may be inclined to lay some of the responsibility at our door* If on the other hand we give our opinion against the Sultan's proposals he will be in a position to make this an excuse for saying that he was thwarted in his efforts by His Majesty's Government* I enclose therefore herewith a draft letter which I suggest I should be authorised to send to the Sultan on these points* As you are aware the Sultan is a shrewd and capable Ruler, and once he understands that he cannot father His Majesty's Government with his schemes, nor expect assistance from them in carrying these out, he 'will not bite off more than he can chew 1 *! If he finds he cannot tatekle the Baluchis in the wholesale manner he suggests he will leave them alone or deal with them piecemeal in some other way* 12 * Our negative attitude, however, (if approved of by His Majesty's Government) in regard to the Sultan’s requests for assistance and advice, does not in any way mean that my approaches to the Sultan will have been without effect. Short of expelling the Baluchis there is a good deal that the Sultan can do in forcing his Walis and his Shaikhs to make it difficult for the traffic through the Batineh to continue. The mere fact that the Sultan is annoyed at the suggestion that his administration cannot stop slave trading on the Batineh will make him all the more eager to do what he can to put it down, and I imagine that the action against Hilal's followers referred to above has been, partly at any rate, the result of my communications. I have hopes therefore that though perhaps the slave trade through /* sent under P.L.Ho.626-3 of 10/7/39. through the Batin eh may not altogether cease, it will appreciably decrease in volume. V/hether this is so or not can be reported in due course. / 13. I am still of the opinion, vide paragraph 3 of my letter No. C/65_ of 17th February 1939, that the main responsibility for this traffic rests with the Persian Government at one end and with the Saudi Arabian Government at the other, and now that approaches have been made to the Sultan I would urge strongly that approaches be also made to these two Governments. I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosures to Metcalfe and Hickinbotham, and without, to Weightman. ~.c. WX'r Translation of letter No# 1^4 dated the 20th June from His Highness Sultan S&amp;iyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oaan to the Hon’ble Lietenant-Colonel oir Trenchard Fowls# Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. i A r~ * * j / T 0 V . f On the 9th June 1939 we received j^our letter No. 608-3 MW.,rrnw«f 1w ii i of the 31st of May 1939 and have noted what has been said about Shakar bin Murad and about the news that you have received regarding the Iranian Baluchis. Our reply is as follows «- 2 . we regret to note the tone of your letter before everything, and that Major Watts,the late Consul at Muscat, did keep you clearly informed of the trouble and intereot tha^ we have been taking in the case of Shakar and our efforts exterminate him and also of the measures that we have been taking with regard to the Iranian Baluchis that arrive in that part of our territory. 3. We believe that if Major Watts had informed you of the true facts and the interest that we had been taking and also what we have explained to him since our return from India last year you would not have sent your above mentioned letter to us. Captain Hickinbotham, the present Consul, will inform you of the facts though he arrived in Muscat only recently. 4 # Yes. We received your letter No. 371/C of the 26th of June 1938 iflien we were both in Karachi and we verbally assured you before leading Karachi that on our return to Muscat we will try our best in the case of Shakar. As soon as we arrived at Muscat we began searching for the man. One of His Majesty’s warships called in at Suwaiq in passing and enquired about Shakar. This news spread through the country, oha^ar* heard it and took care to avoid arrest. The information aboui, the proposed apprehension of the man should have been ke secret and confined to our Government especially as the man is / not apermanent resident in Oman and does not frequent any definite place, nor has he any family or property ehich could have led to his apprehension. He was a man *ko moved from place to place. Sometimes in Oman and sometimes on the coast. -ad we known that he had a permanent residence we would have sent an armed party to bring him in or to attack him i i he r existed. As we did not know of his whereabouts, we offered a money reward to any one who brought him in either alive or dead. 5 When Major Watts returned from iSigland a few days after our return to Muscat we told him that the news of the desire to apprehend Shakar had spread and had made his arrest difficult as he had taken precautions. At this time we heard Shakar had left the Batinah for Mekran and at once informed Major Watts in writing and asked him to transmit the information to you. We clearly informed him that should the man return to the Batinah he would be seized. 6 . There is no doubt that Shakar did not leave the Batinah until he heard of the efforts that we were making to seize him. We left for Dhofar at the beginning of December 1^38 idlere we heard at the beginning of January that Shakar had been killed in Mekran. We did not believe it but continued our preparations to seize him if he returned to the Batinah. On our return from Dhofar Major Watts informed us in answer to our enquiry that the news of Shakar's death was true and so we cancelled our orders for his arrest. 7 . as regards what you say in para 2 of your above quoted letter that Shakar’s death hj^ not caused a decrease in the importation of slaves into the Batinah and that a number of Baluchis have been landed there and taken to Baraimi. We answer that as you^ are aware the Batinah Coast is extensive and there are places far from habitation and the surveillance / of the Walls3 SV ^ of the Walla* The Baluchis who come land at these places* We have Issued strict Instructions to our Walls on the Batlnah to prevent them from landing* They are carrying out our Instructions* When Baluchis land In the places we have mention* ed the Walls do not know about It* That Is their reasonable excuse• 3* Our subjects know our Interest In the Importation of slaves and the efforts we are making to prevent It and punish those engaged in it. So far there is no proof that any of our subjects are openly or secretly engaged in the trade* a&amp;t Most of the cases reported by the Baluchis who run away from the Batlnah to Muscat are against members of their own community* Any one found trading in slaves in our country will be severely punished* Many reports are not true and suspicion cannot be relied upon* 9* You have stated that Iranian Baluchis are taken t to Baraimi• You know that Bar&amp;imi Is divided into two parts* One part belongs to us and the other to the Sheikh of Abdu Bhabi* We have discussed the traffic in slaves with Sheikhs from the part belonging to our Government and could find nothing to lead us to believe that it is taking part in their territory. 10* Regarding what you say in p&amp;ra 3 of your letter regarding the information that you have received to the effect that Sheikh Hilal bin Hamad is dealing in slaves* We reply that so far there is no definite proof that he is so engaged* If the charge could be proved he will certainly be punished* We have been frightening him and threatening him on account of the rumours about him* He has assured us that if the allegat ions are proved he is prepared to be punished. It is not true that our Wall at Suwaiq is unable to stop this Sheikh from doing what he is alleged to be doing. Our Wall does not punish H jial / or any oneor any one elase when there Is no proof . H, It may Interest you - to know that at the end of last year or the beginning of this a boat arrived at Suwaiq and landed within Hilal bin Hamad’s limits 80 Baluchi men and women. Hilal’s followers heard of this. They believed that these persons had been brought from their own country without their consent so they immediately set out and rescued them. They (the Baluchis) were sent to us and a letter was written by us to Major Watts. Bid he inform you about it or has it not yet •&gt; been brought to your notice. 12 , In para 5 of your letter you have drawn our attention to the Slave Treaty of 1874 and the notice issued by our ancestor in that year. We reply that that Treaty has not been forgotten by us and we are fully conversant with it. fce have been respecting the treaties between us and our friend the British Government. If there had been no treaty we should NOT have taken the trouble to prevent slavery which is/permitted by our religion and custom. We do not admit that slave trading does take place openly or secretly in our country •Cases occurring secretly in remote parts should not be sufficent to warrant the statement that traffic in slaves takes place in our country. Our prison contained and'* still contains those who have been accused and whose accusation we have accepted. Does this not show our interest in the prevention of this trade. 13, Please note that Hilal bin hamad is not the only Sheikh of the Yal Sa’ad tribe. There are many Sheikhs in this tribe. They will also be properly warned in addition to what has already been told them. 14, From what we have written you will realise that we are not putting aside the matter of the slave traffic even though it has become negligible)and are doing our best to prevent it. 15, do not like the ^aluchis and their coming to our kingdom. Not only for this but for many other reasons which you will recollect we explained to you when you visited Muscat / inIn February this year. We have been thinking of taking active and strong measures to prevent the entry of Baluchis into our Kingdom. One of your suggestions was that a fine should be imposed on boats importing them. 16. I give below the measures to be taken to prevent the Iranian Baluchis from entering our Kingdom and to dispose of the accusation that there is traffic in slaves s — ( 1 ) The issue of instructions that our orders issued previously to our V*alis to prevent the entry of Iranian Baluchis into our Kingdom and to deport those apprehended entering secretly must be enforced. (2) The deportation of moat of the Iranian Baluchis whose presence may lead to unfortunate incidents and who are of| no value to the country. ^ 7 , jn order to carry out the deportation of the Baluchis we will cause the tribes to rise against them. The Government will aid the tribes. As you know the majority of the Baluchis who have fled to this country are well armed. We expect that fighting will take place between the bolder of them, whose numbers are considerable, and the pursuing tribes. Will you help by destroying their places and dispersing their parties so that their resistance may be quickly overcome and they be deported? IS. We also suggest that His Majesty’s Navy in the Gulf should help by inspecting and searching vessels coming from Mekran to the Batinah. I a© sure that if owners of boats know about the inspection of boats on the sea, the importation of Iranian Baluchis would not only decrease but would cease completely. Our financial position, we regret, does not permit us to build boats for this purpose nor can we afford to employ watclimen to watch the Batinah Coast. Otherwise we have been doing our best to stop the slave traffic. 19. If you have suggestions contrary to ours,will you / please7^ - 6 • r\ please inform us of them. 20. In para 9 of your letter you state that you have informed His Majesty's Government of your communication to us on this subject so we shall be grateful if you will communicate our reply to His Majesty's Government. We awaityour reply to our suggestions. 21. Kindly accept my best regards.■■■■ ClLS) Translation of letter Ko* 196 dated the 20th June 1939 from His Highness o&amp;iyid 3&amp;id bin Taimur, 3ultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat to the Hon'ble Lt.-Col.

At the same time they recognise the difficulties which Your Highness has to contend with in that part of your State,, and note with satisfaction the measures which lour Highneas has taken to deal with slave trading by having offered a reward for the apprehension of Chakar bin i^urad, which caused him to leave Muscat territory, in taking action against the followers of Shaikh Hilal bin Hamad, and in issuing instructions to your tfalis to make every effort to suppress this traffic. His Majesty’s Government trust that these measures will have a good result.4. With reference to paragraph 7 of my letter InIo• 624-S of the 10th July 1939• The reply of His Majesty # s Government is as follows* First, they regret that they are unable to assist with their armed forces your uovernment against the baluchis* They regard this matter as one of internal administra tion, which they leave to lour Highness to deal with* In this connection His Majesty’s Government desire me previously to say (as xxxXsocj&amp;x pointed out in paragraph 9 of my letter ^o.624-S of 10th July 1939 to iour Highness) that the Ships of His Majesty’s navy already conduct searches of dhows as part of their normal duties and will of course continue to do so* 5* Secondly, His Majesty’s Government are loath to offer lour Highness advice as to the advisability of the measures which Your Highness has in mind to take against the Baluchis, since this is a question of which Your Highness is in the best position to form an opinion.

Political Resident in the lersian GulfjXm-m * Ho. 92 (1195/1437/9) 4415 British Legation Jedda May 30th . 9 1939 My Lord, In my despatch No. 44 (525/1437/3) of March 9th., 1939, I had the honour to transmit certain reports concerning the traffic in slaves which appears still to continue in this country. I now add the following information reported to me by Mr. Lai Shah, Indian Vice-Consul at this Legation. 2. Mr. Lai Shah has recently had conversations with a member of the well known Jedda firm of Zainal Ali Reza, the local agents of Messrs. Turner Morrison and Company, Limited, of India. Messrs. Zainal have many connexions with India, the various members of the firm being of Persian extraction, most of them educated in Bombay. 3. The firm had lately bought a Baluchi slave boy from Mecca, and he was being sent to school with his brother and was very happy; The firm had then bought a Baluchi slave girl of nine years of age who was crying for her mother. They were trying to find the mother at Riyadh. If she was found they would buy her and set her and the girl at liberty if they wished it. But, said the member of the firm, slaves in their house were treated as members of the family and no slave had ever tried to get away. The firm did not / sell The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G.,sell slaves to other persons: if they did not like their slaves, they set them at liberty* The girl coso forty gold pounds. Both children knew no language other than their native Baluchi. Mr. Lai Shah asked how the firm could buy slaves who had not been slaves previously: the reply was that tne oaudi regulations on that point could easily be evaded. 4. The interesting point about this story is that the children spoke nothing but their native tongue: this seems fairly conclusive proof of recent enslavement. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department (No.1196/1437/9), the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No.1197/1437/9) and to the Political Agents at Muscat (No.1198/1437/9) and Bahrain (No.1199/1437/9).

Thereupon J*ibi, three soldiers and the Baluchi were placed on a dhow by the *att and despatched to Muscat. On the way the dhow, for some unexplained reason, touched the Coast and was attacked by an aimed band of some 40 Baluchis who liberated the prisoners and made off. 3 0 A messenger whom iour Bigness sent to Suwaiq to investigate the matter had returned confirming the information / which- 2 ~ which xour Highness had received in the first instance.

An examination of the Agency records failed to pro- duce any evidence in support of the contention that slaves were being brought from Gwadur to the Batineh. 1 have made careful enquiries locally and in the neighbourhood of Oiaburah and Suwaiq and am convinced that the statements of the informants of the Minister at Jeddah with regard to Gwadur are not founded on fact. 3 . My enquiries show that all the Baluchis who come to the Batineh Coaat and are enala^ed are from Persian Baluchistan. Conditions In Berdan Beicran are Tory difficult and there is great poverty# The result ie that members of able-bodied Iranian Baluchis are induced to sail for the Batineh on the promise of work on arrival. They are not slaves when they leave their own country. It is only on arrival in the Batineh that they find their advisers have become their /masters3 Masters* The/ are brought across by regular traders and alfflost inrariably landed In the neighbourhood of ttuwalq* In the Suwalq area there are three Tillages aabaxhar* &amp;arat and Badha Suwalq which are said to be the centre of the trade* The country Is Inhabited by the Al Sa’di tribe of whoa ShelJch Hllal bln Haaad Is the head* Shelich Hllal bln Hamad Is said to be at Badha suwalq at present* He and his tribe are reported to be actively engaged In the slave trade* At one time traders used to come up from Baralml to the coast but that practice is said to nave ceased now and the Al Sa'di and others talcs the slaves over from the Baluchi dhows and conduct the» to Baralml where they are sold to buyers from Saudi Arabia* I believe very few actually find their way to Bubal* 4* The Wall of suwalq» Tarob bln Q,ahtan Saldl Is powerless to tabs action against the Al Sa'di* 1 am making enquiries regarding the strength of the tribe and their villages and will keep you informed* Cases do occur of armed slave traders making raids on villages or Isolated dwellings In Persian Mekran and carrying off young persons of both sexes as slaves but this does not seem to be the most popular swthod of obtaining slaves* The normal method mentioned In paragraph 3 is so muoh Isss trouble* The sultan le taking an active Interest In the prevention of slave trading and has been In oonnunloatlon with hie Walls* He ie personally dealing with the outstand ing oases that 1 dleoueeed with him at the end of last month. 7. 1 am sorry to say that local enquiries and the report of an agent sent specially to Suwalq and JChaburah show that as many as 50 Baluchis are brought over every month / and thatand that the majority of them find their way to Saudi Arabia ria daraimi.

I am, however, to invite Lord Zetland*s attention to the accompanying despatch from Sir Reader Bullard about the introduction of slaves into Saudi Arabia from the Trucial coast. This report suggests that apart from the incident at Abu Dhabi, Debai is a centre for the distribution of large numbers of slaves from the Persian Gulf destined for Saudi Arabia ; and that the offences of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi are relatively less important. If this is soothe fact that Debai is so much more important a centre of the slave trade may constitute a further reason for not proceeding to extreme measures against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi; but it also makes it essential, in Lord Halifax’s opinion, that every possible effort should be made to put a stop to this traffic on thefki ?X. ** ^ (.xc^ w. P2..!l«8/ V Trucial coast generally* 3. Although His Majesty’s Government are under no greater legal obligation than is any other Power to act as the mentors of the Saudi Arabian Government in matters relating to slavery and the slave trade, the fact that they surrendered their right of manumission in return for the promulgation of regulations intended to check the introduction into Saudi Arabia of slaves from abroad cannot be disregarded, and does in fact imply some degree of moral responsibility for bringing to the notice of the Saudi Arabian Government infractions of their own regulations. 4. At the same time. His Majesty’s Government cannot escape responsibility for the slave traffic in Muscat, or on the Trucial coast, even when it passes through places, such as Bahraimi, which are not at present under their effective control, seeing that the whole of Arabia lying South and East of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen is a territory for which they are internationally responsible; and it would greatly strengthen the hands of His Majesty’s Government in any representations which it may hereafter be thought necessary or desirable to make to the Saudi Arabian Government if they could point to the fact that they were doing everything possible to suppress the traffic in areas in which they, for their part, were responsible. 5. I am therefore to express Lord Halifax’s earnest hope that consideration may be given to the question of takingtaking urgent steps to induce the Trucial Sheikhs to put a stop to this traffic upon the Trucial coast, and similarly to induce the Sultan of Muscat to put a stop to traffic through Muscat territory, should the approach suggested in the Political Residents letter to the Political Agent at Muscat of the 23rd March prove ineffective.

March 9th., 1939. /U4 My Lord, In my despatch of February 22nd, 1938, (374/535/6), I had the honour to furnish information tending to show that human beings were being imported into oaudi Arabia as slaves from the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, I have recently received reports from two British subjects, one of them very well informed and, I believe, thoroughly reliable, which confirm the information sent a year ago.. 2. Both my informants agree that a considerable number of slaves, particularly young girls, reach rasa from the eastern side of the Persian Gulf, and that zhe best are bought up for Riyadh, where there is a constant demand, especially for the amirs. i 1 hey agree too that some if not most of these slaves come from British Baluchistan, a fact particularly distasteful to the second of my informants, who is himself of Baluch origin. It is believed that the victims are stolen by raiders who make a profession of this practice. From a third source I heard some time ago of several children in the Hejaz, vaguely described as '''Persians' who had been kidnapped quite recently in this way. 3. The second informant states that the common route used is from Gwadur to Dibai. He says thatthe flow of slaves from Baluchistan began, or began to increase from insignificant proportions, about two and a half years ago, since when he reckons that nearly three hunared and fifty such slaves, most of them young girls, have been imported into/ The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, ¥,. ,into Riyadh. This information suggests that when the supply from Abyssinia was mainly or wholly cut oft by the Italian conquest, a source of supply was speedily found on ^he * uaj o f •• other side of the Persian G-ult. 4. It is evident that the Saudi authorities ignore the regulation of October 1936. 5.

L Could you please refer to my letter i*o«^/65 of the 17th February, on the subject of slave ixading on the Trucial Coast in which i said i would deal with Slave leading at Abu Dhabi separately. 2. Since writing my Express Letter no.C/336 of the 19th June 1938 the following slave case, which has occurred in Abu Dhabi, has come to light. In about April 1938 All bin Muhammad, a Somali was kidnapped near baraimi by bedouin, taken to Abu Dhabi and there sold to one Khalfan bin Muhammad. ihe latter, after ten days, re-sold him, again at Abu Dhabi, to one Ali bin Said, of Dalmah. In September All bin Muhammad escaped from Dalmah, sought refuge at the Residency Agency, at Sharjah, and was granted a certificate of manumission. 3. This case is in addition to the information previously given to the India Office and 1 am more than ever satisfied that there has been a sufficient breach of the Shaikh*s undertaking to justify the course of action I originally proposed (see my telegram Lo.T/l79 of 1st August). 4. If we went forward with action against the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi v;e would present him with an ultimatum on the general lines given in paragraph 2 of my Express Letter quoted above read with paragraph 8, with the alteration that / R.T. Peel, Esq., M.C The India Office, London. RECo. POL.DEPt. - 3APR1939 INDIA OFFICEp. 2114 that we would now demand the expu of..*l*alfcii4 hin kuhammad and all bln oald 1 see paragraph 2 above) or the payment of a fine, plus a security against future slave -f Y*Q r\ 4 niT. 5. borne time, however, has elapsed since i made my original proposals, and the local situation at s&amp;u ^Jhabi has altered considerably. in June last year the shaikh's attitude was distinctly contumacious. ne adopted a hostile attitude towards the proposals of Petroleum boncessions Limited for an oil concession and had openly expressed his opinion of nis Majesty*s government’s 'ultimatum*, to the effect that they could not permit any other bompany than Petroleum boncessions Limited to obtain a concession, as hQY/a • wind. he had further refused point blank quite a reasonable request from us that he should assist a party of Petroleum boncessions Limited to visit -oaraimi through his territory. His attitude was objectionable in itself, and a bad example to the other irucial boast bhaikhs. ^iite apart therefore from the merits of the slave trading case against him, which was very strong, there were no general political objections to the action proposed. 6. hecently, hov/ever, the bhaikh has given Petroleum boncessions Limited an oil concession on more or less reasonable terms and has assisted an exploration party of that Company to visit baraimi• it is true that the party were unable to make much use of this visit, but the fact remains that the Shaikh's attitude now is a considerably more friendly one, and there seems no doubt that he wishes once more to be on amicable terms with us. further Y/e shall /shall require his assistance next winter in the important matter of getting iretroleurn Concessions idmited's party once more into the hinterland* jurom the local point of view therefore there is much to be said for keeping him on good terms with us. if on the other hand we present him with the ultimatum mentioned in paragraph 4 above, even if he gives way and pays the fine he will be disgruntled and unlikely to help with i-etroleum concessions limited's exploration, still more so if he does not give way, when we shall have to bombard his fort. 7. ihere is a further consideration too, thou^a this is outside my scope,* that nis majesty 1 s covernment are at present engaged, and presumably will be for some time engaged, in important and delicate negotiations on the subject of halestine. i do not imagine therefore that His Majesty’s Covernment would contemplate at this juncture the possibility of having to bombard the fort of an Arab Shaikh unless this could be avoided. 8. Frankly therefore it is a question of expediency. In so far as striking a blow at the slave trade, considered by itself, is concerned, there is no doubt that the ultimatum I have suggested is the best course. 9. On the other hand the considerations which i have put forv/ard in paragraphs 6 and 7 above must be given considerable v/eight, and personally i am of the opinion that they outweigh the considerations connected with slave trade. In this connection it must be remembered that the slave trade is of small proportions. 10. In all the above circumstances therefore i suggest /suggest that the proposal for an ultimatum to the shaikh be dropped# our hands are quite free to adopt this line of action since j. have of course been careful not to convey any threats to the shaikh of any further action than my depriving him and his &gt;-&gt;tate of travel facilities “until further notice** - vide paragraph 2 of weightman's letter i*o#Vl 75 of 28th j^arch 1938 to uibson - from which he has suffered a good deal of inconvenience. on the v/hole x suggest therefore that x close the matter by writing the ohaikh a letter, a copy of vrhich ± enclose. ± would be grateful if x could be informed in due course iwhether nis majesty's Government approve of this course of action. * i am sending a.copy of this letter and of its enclosure to ^etcalfe and weightman. sent under Jr#L#J»o.211-S of 18/3/39♦«** To Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zayid, Ruler of Abu Dhabi. After Compliment8, You will remember that when I last saw you I mentioned to you that I had received reports of extensive slave trading in your State. You were unable at that time to satisfy me that these reports were incorrect and I found it necessary to withdraw from you the good offices of His Majesty^s Government. 2. I have recently made enquiries from the Political Agent, Bahrain, in regard to this question, and he has assured me that according to his informa- tion there has been an improvement in this respect in Abu Dhabi. It would not be correct to say that slave trading has finally ceased f for there axe cases such as that of the slave Ali bin Muhammad Somali about whom you had correspondence with the Political Agent. I understand, however f that in this case you went to considerable trouble, and I am informed by the Political Agent that he believes / you- 2 - you fully recogi isclQii^Qecefijsity of abiding by your Treaties with the British Government and of putting an end to the traffic in slaves. 3. In these circumstances I intend now to restore to you the good offices of His Majesty^ Government. I trust I can count on you to continue your efforts whole-heartedly to put a stop to slave traffic in your State. I need scarcely remind you, my friend, that the strict observance of your Treaties with the British Government is a matter of great importance.

CtcL Could you please refer to your demi-official letter No. P.Z.629/39 of the 3rd February 1939 with enclosure on the subject of slave trading on the Trucial Coast and the hinter land. With regard to slave trading at Abu Dhabi, I am replying to this separately. 2* With reference to paragraph 3 of my letter No.30-S of 9th January to you, the following is an extract from a recent letter from Weightman summarieing the report of a special agent who was sent to collect information on the subject of Slavery as well as other matt erai * He (the agent) stated that according to general information only about 50 slaves were sold into Nejd from the Baraimi area annually, but I cannot put much credit in this statement for the simple reason that he knew nothing about Hamas ah. However he did say that prices in Baraimi are about Rs.200/- for men and Rs.300/- for women and that they sell again in Hasa and Nejd for about 400/- and 500/- respectively. He gave the names of two Dubai slave brokers end these I confirmed from the Residency Agent when I went down to Sharjah two days ago. Shaikh Said is doing his best to catch them but they usually live in the desert and only sneak into Dubai at intervale. Other information which the agsnt gave me was that / some R.T.Peel Esquire, M.C., The India Office, London # / 2 4FEBI939 INDIA OFFICE lii- - 2 - ♦♦some of the people in the Trucial Coast towns are ♦•cashing in” on their slaves, partly because of their fear of manumission by us and partly because of the declining pearl industry# The Residency Agent tells me there is something in this, though he adds that slaves sold into Nejd really do very well, as they are well looked after and usually are emancipated after six or seven years and sent back. He also states that for every 5 slaves sent into Baraimi en route to Nejd from the Trucial Coast there are 95 coming up from the Batineh. since the Residency Agents sources of infor mation have been improving in the last year I am inclined to believe that he is probably right. The general impression which I get is that slave trading via the Trucial Coast is decreasing.•♦ 2oW»/ 'to 3# It will be seen therefore that slave trading on the Trucial Coast itself, where our responsibilities lie, is as I have always maintained exiguous. In the interior Baraimi is a centre for slave trading but we have no control there and cannot hold ourselves responsible for it, and such slaves as are sent to Baraimi come not from the Trucial Coast, but from the Batineh which is Muscat territory. Moreover there is little local demand for slaves in Baraimi itself or anywhere else in the hinterland, and the reason why slaves are taken to Baraimi is for export to Saudi Arabia# If the officials of the Saudi Arabian Government were to carry out their 'Instructions con cerning Traffic in Slaves', the slave trade in Baraimi and the hinteiland would, practically cease to exist# In this connection please see Bullard^ letter No#3 4 of the 22nd February 1938 to /thethe Foreign Office. Lastly the majority of the slaves coming from the Batineh are kidnapped from Persian Baluchistan, and if the Persian Oorernment exercised proper control over that part of their country this supply would cease to exist. Briefly therefore the responsibility for such slave trading as goes on in the hinterland rests with the Persian Government at one end, and with the Saudi Arabian Government at the other. 4 . with regard to the number of slaves sold annually at Baraimi, my opinion, and Weightman agrees with me, is that Howes* estimate of 1000 per annum is far too high. It is impossible of course to give anything like an accurate estimate but I am inclined to accept the agent’s figure quoted above J* * Jl ll'fk ^ , 't w of about 50. One consideration which must be borne in mind ru. &lt;*-[ ^ regard to slave trading generally is as follows. Slaves are used for three purposes (a) domestic work in the house* (b) pearling, (c) date gardens, (a). The demand is probably much the same as in the past. (b). The demand is undoubtedly on the decrease owing to the serious continued slump in the pearl market, (c). There has certainly been no increase in date cultivation either in the Trucial Coast area or in Saudi Arabia* The general demand therefore for ’•captured* 1 slaves has definitely decreased, and there is, of course, a constant supply of domestic slaves, i.e. those born in slavery. ♦ I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Weightman * sent under Printed letter No.C/66 of the 17th February , 19 39.P.Z.470/1939.

Sir The Emir Feieal called on me on the 31st January accompanied by the Emir Khalid, the Saudi Arabian Minister and Fuad Bey Hamza, who interpreted. 2. His Royal Highness said that he had been charged to deliver a message to His Majesty’s Government from King Abdul Aziz. His Majesty attached the greatest importance to his friendship with Great Britain and it was his desire that this friendship should be something more than that between two countries in normal treaty relations. It was distressing to him to see this traditional friendship clouded by the Palestine question. There were many outstanding questions which he hoped would be discussed during the visit of the delegation to London, but the Palestine question was the most important. He thought it essential that a solution which would satisfy the Arabs’ legitimate aspirations should be found. He believed in the justice of His Majesty’s Government and he hoped that now at last they would be able to devise such a solution. In view of this long-standing friendship, he hoped that if any difficulties occurred during the conferences with the Arab delegations, His Majesty’s Government would make use of the Saudi Delegation as mediators. 3. I thanked the Emir Feisal for this message and said that His Majesty’s Government greatly appreciated the friendship of King Abdul Aziz and that it had always been their policy to keep this friendship as close as possible. They/ der Bullard, K.C.M. G. , C.I.E. , etc., etc. , etc. , Jedda.2 They were most grateful to His Majesty for the steps he had taken to ensure the attendance of the Arab delegations at the Conferences and for sending his son as his delegate to London. His Majesty’s Government were fully alive to the importance of the Palestine question both in regard to the situation in that country and in regard to its effect on their relations with other Arab States. I hoped that His Royal Highness would realise the difficulties which confronted His Majesty’s Government not only on the Arab side but on the Jewish side as well. I added that it was the earnest desire of His Majesty’s Government to find now a final solution which would do full justice to both sides and they counted on the co-operation of the Saudi delegation to assist them in realising this aim. 4. Finally, the Emir Feisal said that it would be disastrous if the Arab delegations, who had come to London convinced of the justice of the Arab cause and of the fairness of His Majesty’s Government should have to return to their respective countries empty-handed. They believed that the Arab case was well-founded. Nevertheless, in order to reach a solution, it might be possible for them to abate some of their just claims, but they also looked to His Majesty’s Government to make their contribution to this solution. 5.

' I have the following information from various sources which I cannot disclose. (a) Extensive slave trading continues in and through Abu Dhabi. The Sheikh is supposed to receive Rs. 40 for each slave bought or sold in Abu Dhabi; while apart from such transactions in the Sheikhdom itself, one informant states that some 400 slaves passed through Abu Dhabi territory en route to Rasa or Nejd in a period of about five months recently. (Note. This figure, I think, is an exaggeration but the general story is probably true.)'Minute Paper. Lf Department Resort to force in dealings with Arab Sheikhs. * Woy 2 ,s) l. The Political Resident refers to two precedents for the use of a threat to size pearling dhows (Ahu DhaM, 1934, and Umm al Qawain&gt; 1937). In the former P.Z.4405/35 case he presumably has in mind an incident of 1935* in which a threat to seize the Abu Dhabi pearling fleet was contemplated (but apparently not delivered) in the event of the Sheikh refusing to apologise for a display of incivility to the Commander of His Majesty’s Ship M Fowey”. The use of the threat was approved by H.M.G. P.Z.3331/37 (Foreign Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry concurring) In the Umm al Qawain case in 1937 the threat to interfere v/ith the pearling fleet was approved by H.M.G. in connection with the Sheikh’s obduracy in refusing adequate facilities for the survey of his harbour. 2. In 1930 a threat was made, and executed, to P.3516/30 seize the pearling dhows of Ras al Khaimah, the Sheikh ♦ having refused to allow a petrol barge for the use of the R.A.F. to be moored off his territory. There was no question in this case of failure to carry out a previous undertaking. The possibility of resort to bombardment was discussed at the time. The Air Ministry (being very much concerned about the establishment of the air route) were in favour of this course, but there was reason to think that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Arthur Henderson) would have raised difficulties, since he felt doubtful of our legal right to insist on the Sheikh providing the desired facilities. In the event a settlement was reached/ 7173 Wt 8900/111 10.000 4.88s reached with the Sheikh without further consideration having to he given to the question of useing a threat of force. 3. In a despatch written in this connection the I Political Resident said - 'In former times, when greater latitude in respect of the destruction of tov/ers by H.M.Ships was accorded to local officers and the Government of India than is apparently the case to-day, it has seldom happened that it has actually been necessary to put the threat of bombardment into execution, and the mere threat has sufficed to bring about the submission of the Sheikh concerned. It proved sufficient at Dibai in 1910; at Ramz in 1910; at Ajman in 1911; at Umm-al-Qawain in 1914; at Sharjah in 1916; and finally at Ras-al-Khaimah in 1926. It did not prove sufficient at Khassab (1930) but this was I think due to the fact that an idea had got about among these Arabs that H.M.’s ships could no longer take action against them.' 4. The following paragraphs describe briefly the post-War cases of bombardment, or the threat of it, v/hich it has been possible conveniently to trace in our records. 5* Ajman , 1921. The Sheikh had been guilty of a number of offences (one of them the destruction of an agency manumission certificate) and v^as most truculent when interviewed by the Resident. The Resident ordered payment of a fine, with a threat if payment were not made to bombard his towers. (Note: this threat was made with the concurrence of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who was present; no higher , (n+J- nst authority ?/as consulted). Th-pi hnri t.o. &gt;&gt;0 fti* UcnJ Imam.

The Resident reported his proceedings to the Government of India* who approved them. 6. Fu.1airah» 1925. The Sheikh of Fujairah v/as a recalcitrant feudatory of Sharjah. He was known to have bought a Baluch girl who had been kidnapped from Sharjah. He refused to give satisfaction when visited by the Resident, and bombardment was resorted to. It is stated on this occasion that the S.N.O. sought and obtained permission from the Naval Commander in Chief to bombard the fort of Fujairah and seize and destroy the Sheikh’s property if necessary. The Sheikh’s fort, li miles inland, was bombarded for la bours and wrecked (221 rounds were fired) and a threat made to burn a large and valuable dhow which was found hauled up on the beach,^ The Government of India, IxrftU ilu /UAi+U’ iKaJr tiu, fkMijrcu* hur (&amp;* Ifioo) P.5982/28 p.5066/30 P.Z.998/32 again ex post facto, approved the proceedings. No fatal casualties were reported. 7* Sur , 1928. Action had to be taken to restore the authority of the Sultan of Muscat at Sur, v/here it v/as flouted by a local Sheikh. Under the orders of the Government of India a sloop was sent and bombarded the Sheikh’s fort. The action was of no permanent value, as no steps were taken to consolidate the Sultan’s authority. When the situation deteriorated in 1930 the possibility of having recourse to aerial bombardment was discussed. The A.O.C., ^raq, and the Air Ministry gave their support, but the suggestion was not followed up in view of the achievement of a settlement by more pacific means. . 8# Sur , 1932. On the occasion of further trouble at/ 717-1 Wt 8900/111 10.000 4.88;; H ' at Sur H.M.G. authorised proposals involving in certain contingencies the demolition of the recalcitrant Sheikh’s fort on the coast hy naval action and the destruction of his inland fort hy air action. The threat of force v/as made to the Sheikh and an aerial demonstration v/as carried out hut the Sheikh gave way before force was actually used. 9. Khasab 1930. The Sultan of Muscat’s authority was defied by the Sheikh of Khasab during a visit of the survey vessel H.M.3.’’Ormonde”. Proposals were made for the reassertion of the Sultan’s authority which extended, in the event of the Sheikh refusing compliance, to the destruction of his fort. The proposals were brought before the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India and approved. A more extensive bombardment was proposed subsequently and was approved by the Cabinet on the understanding that every precaution would be taken against loss of human life. The bombardment was carried out and a blockade instituted before the Sheikh gave v/ay. 10. Sharjah, 1931. An attempt had been made by Arabs at Sharjah to secure by force the surrender of three slaves v/ho had taken refuge seeking manumission, with the Residency Agent. Prompt action was proposed and authorised by H.M.G., viz. surrender of the ring leader; failing that, payment of a fine of Rs.2,000 and 100 rifles; failing that also, bombardment of the Sheikh’s fort outside the tov/n. (Approval on this occasion was given in consultation with the Admiralty only, not with the Foreign Office). In the event the threat was sufficient and the Sheikh paid up before force had to be used. 11.

With the exception of bombardments to cover the landing or evacuation of troops this duty in the Persian Gulf is a oolitical punitive measure and is subject to the following conditions:- (1) Proper v/arning must be given.

Sir, I am directed hy Viscount Halifax to request you to inform the Marquess of Zetland that he has given further consideration to the information disclosed in the correspondence ending with your letter P.Z. 2044/38 of the 16th April regarding the reported continuance of the traffic in slaves overland from certain of the Trucial Sheikhdoms into Saudi Arabia. 2. As Lord Zetland will recall. His Majesty f s Government recently renounced, at the instance of the Saudi Arabian Government, the right of manumission by His Majesty^ Legation in Jedda. They were influenced in this course by the expressed readiness of the Saudi Arabian Government to devise regulations designed, inter alia , to put an end to the importation of new slaves into Saudi Arabia. These regulations were duly promulgated, and under Article 1 (2) the importation of slaves into Saudi Arabia by land routes was forbidden except on production of a Government document from the slaved country of immediate origin attesting his slave status in that country. 3. Lord Halifax feels therefore that while it is desirable that His Majesty’s Government should avoid any action/ The Under-Secretary of State,action which implied that they had admitted a special responsibility for the conduct of the Saudi Arabian Government in this matter greater than the responsibility of other Powers it is nevertheless in some degree incumbent on His Majesty’s Government to ensure, insofar as it is reasonably within their power to do so, that proper effect is given by the Saudi Arabian Government to their undertakings in this respect* 4. The interim measures taken by the Political authorities in the Persian Gulf, as indicated in the enclosure in your letter under reference, may prove effective in checking what appears to be a recrudescence in the traffic in slaves to and from certain of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. Lord Halifax will however be glad if he may be furnished in due course with a further report on the subject and any such information which may become available as will furnish material for any representations which His Lordship may after further consideration deem it desirable to make to the Saudi Arabian Government. 5.

Mr. Lermitte, who recently stayed for some time in Abu Dhabi in connection with his negotiations with the Shaikh, informed me in the course of conversation that a certain amount of slave trading went on there. He quoted one case in which a slave, who was going /% to be sold took refuge in his house. As he, Mr.Lermitte, was in no position to protect him he advised him through his servants to return to his master. Mr^ermitte was unable to give the name of the slave. He also quoted a case he had heard oft a woman i... whose husband was being sold to an individual in $atar. 2. Mr.Lermitte knows Arabia well, and has had considerable experience of Arabs, and I am quite prepared to accept his state- -ments that slave trading to some extent goes on in Abu Dhabi - the more so as it is situated a considerable distance from other {Signature) Trucial/ [Designation)i\3&gt;; 2 . Trucial Coast Sliaikhdoma, and away from our observation. Please therefore instruct the Residency Agent to write 3 to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi as follows. That from reliable information received it has come to my knowledge that slave trading goes on in Abu Dhabi territory contrary to the Treaty which the Shaikh has with His Majesty^ Government. That therefore I see no reason why he - the Shaikh - should con- -tinue to receive the good offices of His Majesty’s Govern- -ment which will cease until further notice. 4 No mention of course should be made in your communi- -cation to the Residency Agent as to Mr. Lermitte being our source of information. Owing to his conmercial connections with the Shaikh ef Abu Dhabi Mr.Lermitte does not wish to be mixed up with slave cases. 5. The good offices mentioned above will include the stoppage of travel papers for the Shaikh and his subjects. This should be explained in your communications to the Residen cy Agent, but the latter should not refer to it in his letter to ohaikh* The Residency Agent can at seme convenient opportunity, there is no need for him to take a special j our- -ney to Abu Dhabi for the purpose, explain this t o t he Shaikh verbally. 6.

Possibly some of the slaves may be sent to Hasa from Debai through Abu Dhabi, and, personally, I believe that it is the latter place which is engaged in this trade. As a conseauence of the information I received I asked if he would be good enough to direct the sloops of the Persian Gulf division to pay special attention/2 . attention to searching dhows in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi. It is interesting to note in paragraph 2 Bullard's letter that his informant stated 'The dhows engaged in the traffic travelled at night in order to evade the British patrol.^ The traffic to Hasa by sea seemed to have^ fallen off considerably during the last few months, but according to his information slaves were still being imported by land from the Persian Gulf.' This means that that while slaves are brought across the Persian Gulf from Persian Baluchistan to Abu Dhabi, from the latter place they are conveyed by land to iiasa. This speaks well for the effectiveness of the sloop patrols along the Arabian coast, which is our more % immediate responsibility. The responsibility for not allowing the slaves to be exported from Persian Baluchistan lies of course v/ith the Persian Government, but so long as the latter fail to carry out this responsibility (see for instance the first sentence ol paragraph 4 of my express letter Ho.155 S of 9th March) and the Saudi Government are equally lax in allowing the import of slaves into their territory as appears evident from UuliLprft 1 s letter, our efforts in stopping this trade must naturally be much hampered.J On receiving the information referred to in my paragraph 2 above, in addition to making my request to Poland I informed the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi A that information had reached me as to the slave trade which was oeing carried on in his territory ana that until xurther notice he would be deprived oi tne good ofiices of His Majesty’s Government. This includes the stoppage of the issue of travel papers for himself and his subjects.

AS the period of one year mentioned in article 9 of the Saudi ‘ ‘ Instructions concerning Traffic in Slaves ' (sent to you in my despatch No. 278 of the 6th October, 1936) expired on the 2nd October last, this Legation has since that date been endeavouring, by discreet enquiries, to ascertain what the exact position is. I have the honour to report the following information, which is intended to complete that contained in my despatch No. 102 of the 24th May last. 1 must emphasise, however, that the indirect enquiries which I have caused to be made have been quite unofficial, so that the resulting information, though I believe it to be correct, must be regarded with reserve. 2. Nothing has been heard of any six-monthly report on the lines of article 14, nor of any supplementary observations of the Inspector of Slave Affairs (who, it will be remembered, is the Director-General of Police at Mecca). It is not laid down, however, that such reports should be published. 3. Certain licences have been issued to slave-brokers in accordance with article 12. Two brokers, named Hassan Amudi and Muhammad-bin-Seif, say that they obtained licences from the Jedda police authorities against the payment of £1 gold per licence. 4. One or two slaves only have been registered at Jedda. But the Jedda brokers say that a large number of slaves have been registered at Mecca. 5. Mr. Ousman, pro-consul at this Legation, who was employed at Riyadh during this summer, reports that there were a large number of slaves at the capital.

Bullard to Mr. KdeK^ t'oJA’r 26.) w (No. 278.) gi r Jedda, October 6, 1936. 1 HAVE the honour to report that your despatch No. 221, dated the 26th August, regarding the Treaty of Jedda, &amp;c., arrived only the day before I reached Jedda, and that consequently Mr. Calvert had no time to act on the instructions in paragraph 2 of your despatch before I took over from him. I informed the Amir Feisal, at the dinner which he gave the day after I presented my credentials, that we were ready to effect the proposed exchange of notes, but the Amir had no responsible official of the Ministry for foreign Affairs with him in Taif, and Sheikh Tusuf Yasin had to be fetched from Riyadh. He arrived at Jedda on the 30th September, very anxious that the formalities should be concluded at once, and in particular that the Slavery Regulation should appear in the Mecca newspaper, the Um.m-al-Qura, on the 2nd October, Friday, which is the only day in the week on which this paper is published. 2 With some difficulty Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who is, I gather, both suspicious and fussy, was persuaded to agree to the amendment suggested in para graphs 3 and 5 of your despatch, so that the object of the notes should read as the modification of the conditions under which the treaty might be terminated. He was, however, very anxious to insert a passage referring to the modification of certain provisions of the Treaty of Jedda and of the Clayton letters, and a harmless draft was made to which your approval was given in your telegram NollL dated the 2nd October. Meanwhile, I felt that the instructions in your despatcfT No. 221 referred to above justified the immediate exchange of the con fidential notes after amendment of the passage criticised by the Foreign Office to the unimpeachable phrase “ notes relative to the Treaty of Jedda, and the publication of the Slavery Regulation. The confidential notes were therefore exchanged on the 1st October, and the Slavery Regulation appeared on the 2nd October. For the third step, however, I awaited the receipt of your reply to my telegram No. Ill, dated the 30th September, in which, besides quoting the additional words proposed bv Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, I recommended that, to obviate the delay which would result if we waited for a reply from Ibn Saud as to slaves on hand at the moment of the exchange of the final notes, we should be content with a letter which I was sending with the confidential note, explaining that my signature would be affixed to the final note on the assumption that slaves on hand at that moment would be dealt with under the old arrangement, a point on which I anticipated no difficulty. On receipt of your telegraphic reply, No. Ill, dated the 2nd October, the exchange of the final notes was duly effected. I should explain that the Amir Feisal remained at Taif throughout, the two notes being sent up to him for signature and handed to me, signed, by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. 3. Enclosed herewith are the undermentioned documents :— (a) W W (d) (e) (/) Confidential note about slavery signed by the Amir Feisal on the 1st October, 1936, enclosing Slavery Regulation (in Arabic).

The amendment of the Slavery Regulation that was suggested in para graph 4 of your despatch under reference was found to be unnecessary, as the draft produced by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin for publication left articles 8 and 9 in the original order. The translation enclosed is the version as amended b\ the memorandum enclosed in Sir Andrew Ryan’s despatch No. 156, dated the :26th May, with a few changes which I have ventured to make, the only change of any importance is the replacement of “ law by “ Islamic law in several places. It occurred to me that unless this change were made the reader might think that the reference was to Saudi regulations and not to the Sharia. 5. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that they would like to publish the final notes on Friday, the 9th October, and to issue even before that date a notice announcing the exchange of the notes. I reminded him that in such cases simultaneous publication was often adopted, and he is awaiting your reply to a telegram which I have sent to you on the subject, No. 112, dated the 4th October. 6. It was clearly a great day for Saudi Arabia when the final notes were exchanged, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin did not fail to express the thanks of his Government to His Majesty’s Government and to Sir Andrew Ryan. He reminded me that this was the third treaty concluded by the Saudi Arab Government this year, the others being those with Iraq and Egypt. It seemed to me that there was some special reason why Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had wanted the exchange of notes to be effected so rapidly, and had then wanted to publish the notes at the earliest moment possible, and 1 concluded that Ibn Sand felt that he had been crowded out of the limelight by the Egyptian and Syrian treaties and by the leading part played by Nuri Pasha in the Palestine negotiations, and hoped to regain his position by producing an agreement so advantageous to his country as the one now concluded. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure 1. (b) Amir Feisal to Sir R. Bullard. Your Excellency, Mecca, Rajab 15, 1355 (After compliments.) {October 1, 1936). YOU will recollect the letters exchanged between His Majesty my Lord the King and Sir Gilbert Clayton at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda of the 18th Zul Qa’da, 1345, corresponding with the 20th May, 1927, and Sir Gilbert Clayton’s statement in his said letter that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to consider the abolition of the right of manumission, previously exercised by their consular officers in this country, as soon as it should become clear that the co-operation stipulated in article 7 of the said treaty should have resulted in the enforcement of such practical measures as to render the exercise of the right of manumission no longer necessary. Since the entry into force of the said treaty, the Government of His Majesty the King have exerted themselves to the utmost possible extent to bring the slave trade gradually to an end. With this object they have absolutely prohibited the importation of slaves by sea. They have also imposed stringent restrictions on slave traders. I hey think that it is now time to make new arrangements for dealing with the difficult question of slaves, better applicable to the present circum stances, and at the same time to secure the common humane object, and to put an end to an abnormal state of affairs relating to the purely internal administra tion of the Government of His Majesty. I hey have to this end drawn up a new r draft regulation concerning the manumission of slaves, making slavery subject to certain specified conditions and improving the status and life of existing slaves.3 I enclose a true copy of the proposed regulation which it is intended to promulgate and apply shortly. On perusing it you will no doubt see that the Government of His Majesty the King have done all that is in their power to improve the status of slaves and carefully to control the trade in them. The Government of His Majesty the King consider that when the regulation is promulgated the time will have come to abolish the system whereby the repre sentatives of His Majesty’s Government in the 1 nited Kingdom have continued to manumit slaves presenting themselves of their own free will to His Britannic Majesty’s consular officers at Jedda with a request for liberation and repatriation. ' I have pleasure in informing you that the Government of His Majesty will be ready to publish and put into force this regulation immediately after the receipt of the official communication from your Excellency giving the approval of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to the abolition of the aforesaid right of manumission of slaves. As it is agreed that this note and your Excellency s reply thereto will be (kept) in the confidential archives, the publication of the record of the abolition of the aforesaid right of manumission of slaves in an official manner by your Government will be contained in the two notes relative to the 11 eaty of Jedda which will be exchanged and published within a very short period. I shall be glad if your Excellency will be good enough to reply to this note of mine. With highest respects, FEISAL, Minister for Foreign A ffairs. Enclosure 2.
