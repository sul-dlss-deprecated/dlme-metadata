Sir, 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter Ho.420.S of J.928 dated 2xst .November, 1928, and to thank you for the information contained therein. 1* The Mr Oxficer Commanding considers that when the Plying boats arriva at Jbasrah, that as far as can be foreseen, three advanced bases will be required, namely rK 0WEIT, BAHREIN, and DABAl • he would have lilted HAS EL KHAIMAH, but realises there may be some difficulty before this can be started. He is not quite certain about DAJAI as to its suitability as a Flying Boat base, but has asicea the Senior Laval Officer, Persian Gulf to allow a Flying Boat Officer to proceed down there rid also to BAHREIN in one of H.M.Sloops when it is next going down to those places. 2* _ A point in connection with these advanced bases has arisen, and the Air Officer Commanding would be obliged for your advice on this, it is considered that an intelligent native should be employed at the auove three places so as to look after the temporary shelters and moorings of the Flying Boats. It is thought that if this man was chosen wisely, that h« would be invaluable to the Flying Boats when they arrive at the various places, as he would soon learn what was required in the wa^y oi helping these boats to their moorings etc., employing native labour if necessary and otner various jobs. It is also considered that by employing such a man it would have a good eilect on the local population. Again Am man might wear a visible badge of office such as the R.A.P.

SECRET. NOTES BY THE AIR STAFF ON THE REGULATION OF AIR CONTROL IN UNDEVELOPED COUNTRIES. THE use of Air Power as an instrument for the control of semi-civilized countries is still a recent development, and it is important that all who are in one way or another concerned with its regulation should fully understand the methods by which it operates. The following notes describe the cardinal points of the regulation of this form of control. 1. Moral effect of Air power. It is a generally accepted axiom that the air arm achieves its chief results through the moral effect it produces on the enemy, and when employed in backw ard countries there is the favourable factor that the enemy has little or no air resources with which to counter our action. This enhances the moral effect on the inhabitants, who are confronted with a weapon against which they cannot retaliate. 2. Necessity for co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local Political Authorities. The proper employment of air power is essentially dependent on the most intimate co-operation between the Air Force Commander and the local political authority. If air operations are to be successful, it is vital that all concerned with their conduct, whether civilian administrators or officers of the fighting services, should realise that success is dependent on the effect produced on the enemy mora e. To obtain this moral effect, air forces do not require to get to grips with the enemy, nor do they produce tangible and visible results, such as prisoners of war, casualties to our own personnel and definite advances into the enemy s country. During active air operations there are few of the recognised signs of warfare; there are no long columns, no marching and counter-marching, no Red Cross ambulances, and none ol the so-called panoply of war. Consequently, those who in the past h a ve only been accustomed to fighting on the ground, where nothing can be achieved without gaining actual physical contact with the enemy and defeating him in battle, are not always able to appreciate the effect that air action produces on the enemy s morale and mentality. In land warfare the progress of operations is slow, and it is possible to estimate the result of a particular operation and to foresee the approaching end when one combatant will surrender or ask for an armistice. The political authorities been able to follow the course of the operations and are well aware when the final scene is set and it is their turn to enter the arena and to conduct the peace negotia tions. In air warfare it is not possible to follow the operations stage by stage, and that is especially the case when the operations are carried out against a semi-ciyilised enemy, and when it is consequently difficult to judge the moral effect of air action on his mentality. In this tvne of warfare it is essential that the Air Officer Commanding and the local political authority should act together and maintain the closest touch so that the Commanding Officer, assisted by the advice of the political officer and by his intimate knowledge of the characteristics of the enemy, can keep his hnger on the pulse of the enemy morale and nerves and decide, subject to any overriding political consideration, on the most favourable objectives for attack and can sa^ whether air action should be continued or suspended against former objectives, or whether the bombing should be distributed over a wider area. Unless this close touch is maintained, the Air Officer Commanding cannot advise when the right moment has arrived for air operations to be temporarily suspended, and for the political authority to endeavour to initiate peace negotiations. The air arm is a delicate weapon which is easily blunted if misused, either by wielding it too early or too late, and especiallv too much. How, where, when and in what degree it is to be employed are questions upon which the Air Officer Commanding on the spot, and he alone, can give authoritative advice with the aid of the local political officer, and by using his experience in estimating the effect of the air operations on the morale and mentality of those against whom the operations are being conducted. [ 19366 ]2 Air operations, when carried out against an enemy whose existence is not dependent on a highly organised civilisation, are liable if unduly protracted to create aXttrtude of sulkn resignation. Consequently, as soon as there is reason to believe that the morale of the enemy is affected by the interference with his normal mode of life then offensive air action should be temporarily suspended^ An opp limit) is thus created for the enemy formally or informally to indicate whether the operations have effected a change in his attitude. If that is the case it should be our policy to take immediate advantages of this change of heart to avoid any unnecessary prolongation of air warfare. Otherwise the next stages m active operations are more difficult since the enemy will probably leave his towns and villages and live id the open or in caves. Air operations then become more difficult to undertake and require a longer time to achieve results. , i-,- It is not, perhaps, appreciated that the air arm under these conditi ns exerf® pressure on an enemy in very much the same way as diplomacy. The power of® diplomat and of the air arm alike rest on the fact that the enemy does not know how far we are prepared to go in order to attain our ends; nor does he know what steps we will take to attain them. This close connection between political torce and air power entails the necessity for the most intimate co-operation between the political authority and the Air Officer Commanding. 3. The Importance of Intelligence.” Just as early and accurate information based on a sound intelligence organisation is essential to political authorities to enable them to achieve results, so the Air Officer Commanding is dependent on his intelligence service if he is to obtain a quick, economical and humane success. When land forces are employed for punitive operations, their movements are probably limited to the speed of a camel, or of a horse or a man. If air forces are employed, moving 20 times faster than the older arms, then it is essential that thel speed with which they receive information should be similarly accelerated. To make the fullest use of air power, an enemy or a disturber of the peace living 200 or 300 miles away from an air force must be made to feel that any act of insurrection or violence will meet Avith retribution within 12 to 24 hours of its commission. The offender must not be allowed to feel, as he will if land forces are employed,-that punishment will tarry and that he may be able to use the interval to evade it. Even if the case is one in which the Political authority decides that bombing would not be justified, the air arm should still be made use of, to enable the Political authorities to reach the scene of the trouble and to deal with the matter on the spot within a few hours of it arising. If full use is made of air communications to speed up the diplomatic and administrative action, much can be done to obviate the trouble spreading, and a small misdemeanour can be prevented from developing into a rising on a large scale, and this speeding up is dependent upon a fully organized intelligence^ system. I 4. Necessity for swiftness of decision and action in times both of negotiations and active operations. The essential characteristic of the air arm is rapidity of action; this depends not only upon a quick and accurate Intelligence Service, but also on quick decision to initiate air action. It is of the highest importance once the necessary authority is obtained that the local political officer should come to a prompt decision, in conjunction with the Air Officer Commanding, both on the initiation of air action and on its extension when the situation demands it within the limit of his instructions. 5. Limitations of Air poiver. The air arm is essentially an offensive weapon and can do little towards defending a country if its actions are confined to the tactical defensive. For the success of air operations aircraft must have room for manoeuvre, and so be in a position to locate and attack an enemy some hours before he has reached a position where he can do harm. It is, therefore, important, once it has been decided to initiate air action, not to tie down the aircraft to narrow geographical limits. Air Staff, November 21, 1928.Confidential. JNo« of 19 29.

Squadron has been instructed to land at ! all the places manAioned in paragraphs 2 and 3, with the exception of the Hasa Coast, to make further inspections oi landing grounds, During his previous visits to these places he has been more concerned with their suitability as Flying Boat anchorages, 5, It would be greatly appreciated if you could inform your Agents in these areas that Officer Commanding No. 203 (F.B.) Squadfbn would be grateful for any assist ance that could be given him with regard to the tenancy of ground he proposes to use, rents of store houses for fuel, issuing warnings against encroachments, and the various queries that always arise. The probable dateof his return to Muscat should xim be about August 10th. 6, The importance of this air route in the near future needs no stressing and it is highly probable that in a few years, the internal situation in Persia will make the route by the No them Chores of the Persian Gulf too uncertain if not actually dangeruus* The adoption of these halting places will add materially to tlie trade and importance of the rulers in whose territory the landing grounds are situated. In this connection I may add that it would be a potent argument with the Shaikh of Bahrain if it was impressed upon him Hi at the establi aliment of the special air service for the pearling trade for which ia he has asked would undoubtedly befawilitated by the pro vis ion2 provision of a suitable aerodrome at Bahrain* 7* You will of course appreciate the great advantages of having landing groundsand seaplane/ anchorages adjacent, 8, A copy of a letter that is being sent to Officer Commanding Ho, 20 3 (ShB,) Squadron is forwarded for your information. It will show you the instructions that have been issued to him for his preliminary in vestigation on his return voyage from India. 9, Fina3iy I am to sfegc that you will be kept inform ed of the progress of the development of this land route to India, and that this Command greatly appreciates the help you have already given so freely during the search for seaplane anchorages, which has been so successful.CONFIDENTIAL. r i No. The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his com pliments to The - olitleal A^ent, Muscat The political Agent, Bahrain The * olitical /gent, /luvsrait and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned docu ment (s). /// for infonaati on - 1 A'•’ ,y. n ■ 4 se • ~n Zp \ V ft British Residency and Consulate-General, BUSHIRE.

Moreover I have just received a telegram from the Political Agent to the effect thnt your Company have now addressed him officially on the subject and that the latter would like your representative to visit Hu a cat to conclude a formal lease. 2 . On or about February 23rd, as I learnt on my last visit to the Trucial Coast, your representative Mr. Service called ?t Shargah and entered into negotiations with the Shaikh of th t place for the construction of a petrol store. Neither I, nor the nearest political Officer, Political Agent, Bahrain, had any communication from your Company as to the proposal, but 1 understand that the Residency Agent, who is under my orders, was asked by Mr* Her vice to help in conduct ing the negotiations. I believe that finally Mr. Service had/ The General,Manager, The Anglo-f ersian Oil Company Limited, Abadan.- 2 - bEd to leave Sbargab. without obtaining hia requirenients, ©s he considered the shaikh’s demands excessive. 3. I would be grateful if in future your Company would, in the event of your requiring facilities on the -.rab coast, or at Gwadur, address in the first instance trie xolitical Agent concerned, or in the case of the Trucial coast, lays elf. It is naturally unnecessary forjrae to say that I have no desire to interfere in the work of your Company, on the contrary, I am most anxious to facilitate it in any way I can, as are the officers under me, but in certain cases the facilities your Company require may raise local issues or complications which are likely to be dealt with more successfully through iolitical channels. It is possible, for instance, that if I had been approached in the first instance in the matter of your petrol store at Shargah, I might have been able to persuade the Shaikh to adopt a more reasonable attitude. Having now taken his stand, however, he will probably be difficult to move. On the other hand if, on receiving an official intimation from your Company of your requirements in any area, it is consider ed more suitable for your Company to enter into direct negotiations with the Shaikh concerned, you will of course be informed to that effect.

(a) nrea app^6mately one and half mile long and one wide situated on coast south west of town of Kuwait, three and a half miles from Ras al AbJUZA. This includes the old coaling depot, and (concrete jetty also near?) this^ wireless building now used as quarantine station. (b) Landing ground approximately 400 yards square half mile west JAHRA and close to fort. (c) Landing ground at least 1,000 yards square at AS SUBAIYIYA a quarter of a mile due south of wells. 11 * To enable desirability of actual purchase to be further considered could you let us know (a) whether the areas in question are Government or private, (b) Rough estimate of probable cost in either event. If areas are Government would Shaikh be likely to present them to us. It is of course important, both because financial decision has not been taken here and in the interest of keeping price down if we decide to buy, to keep our interest in areas in question secret. - RETAX ANDUM- jg . t.

Shaikh prepared to loan these indefinitely to Government without rent, provided water rights of Nomad population not interfered with. He will not sell. Secondly, urea 1(a) Shaikh reminded me that this included area leased in 1907 to Government, under name'SHUWAIKH Lease” for which rent Rs.60,000 paid per annum and which we subsequent ly cancelled 1923. Shaikh said he could neither sell nor present to Government, but would rent on easy terms, together with Quarantine Buildings, provided that road intersecting area not interfered with, that anchorage opposite not denied to local craft and that he not asked to repair Quarantine Buildings, Shaikh would not mention rent and did not press matter. Thirdly. From Shaikh’s remarks it is clear that he understands value of area to Oil Company, operating in Kuwait, as it is in close proximity to only completely sheltered deep water anchorage here. In my opinion it is desirable to get special clause inserted without delay in Political Agreement with Kuwait Oil Company whereby latter recognise His Majesty’s Government’s prior right to area. -POLITICAL-SEC RET No. C~85« POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the Iwt March 1934, From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A*, Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e . Royal Air Force Landing Grounds and possible base at KShuwaikh. In continuation of my telegram No.73,, dated the 24th February 1934 to H.M’s Secretary of State for India, copy of which was sent to you. I enclose some notes taken during my two inter views with the Shaikh, which you may find of interest. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait. cN 0 T S S Taken during my discussion with His Excellency the Shaikh (a) on the subject of/landing grounds at Subaihiyeh, Jahara; and (b) Air base at 'Shuwaikh' immediately west of Kuwait Town, First Interview (26,2,54) « !♦ I opened the 'ball' by telling His Excellency tha1 perhaps in the not very distant future the Royal Air Force would like mark out new 'Landing Grounds' at Subai- hiyeh and Jahara, and might even like to locate a squadron of land planes or flying boats at 'Shuwaikh' (I here gave the details of size and position required), I added that whatever these future intentions were, any such measures as contemplated were clearly to his advantage as they would render his State very much safer from an outside enemy, and were clearly of a defensive nature only. Here ^^Taughingly interrupted me and said 'Yes, and the will R.A.F./also be able to defend the Oil Company that gets the Kuwait Concession, so why not say that this is the sole purpose of the R,A,F, wanting landing and base facilities in my State* Why beat about the bush Colonel Dickson' • 2, The Shaikh having rather 'taken the wind out of my sails' and so to speak having 'broken the ice' by his quick perception of what I was driving at, at once assisted me in my object by discussing the whole business with great friendliness and frankness. 3* He said that (a) He had no objection to the R.A.F. marking out the landing grounds at Subaiyiyeh and Jahara as specified, any time they chose. (b) He could not however give such areas outright to His Majesty 1 s Government, nor was he prepared to sell. He would however loan them for as long as His Majesty’s Government desired (rent free) provided the water rights of * his Bedouin and the villages of Jahara were not interefered with. His Majesty’s Government could also, if they liked, erecerect buildings on the sites required, 4. As regards the 'Shuwaikh Area” (including Quarantine Buildings and Coal Depot, miles by 1 mile in size): The Shaikh said that he could neither sell nor present these to Government, but he would be willing to rent the area on terms which he would make as easy as he possibly could and for as long as was required provided (a) That the road to Basra passing through the area was not interfered with; (b) That^the deep-water anchorage lying close in shore immediately in front or tne area specified were not denied to local craft - it being necessary to them as a harbour of refuge during ”Shamals”, when they were unable to enter the various ’basins’ in front of the town on account of low tide (o) He was not asked to repair the Quarantine buildings which would cost at least Rs. 15,000/-, he opined. 5* Shell I asked what rent approximately he would require if His Majesty’s Government eventually decided on taking the ’’Shuwaikh” area, he replied that he would have to think about it, but in any case he would make it as reasonable and as low as he could for the sake of the Royal Air Force, who were King George’s troops and so entitled to every consideration. The Shaikh reminded me, however, that the area mentioned included the land leased by His Majesty’s Government in 1907 (during the Berlin - Baghdad Railway scare) under the name ”Shuwaikh Lease” and that His Majesty’s Government had then paid an annual rent of Rs.60,000/- until 1923 when it was cancelled, 6, The Shaikh then went on to say that the area in question would also obviously be required by any Oil Company, operating in Kuwait, but that he thought it possible (though he was not quite sure) that both the Royal Air Force and any Oil Company operating could find room for ther separate requirements side by side.7* Here I thought it wise not to press the point either in the matter of rent or whether the area beyond that required by the Royal Air Force, was suitable for Oil tanks, landing stages etc. etc. What stood out very plainly was the fact that the Shaikh entirely appreciated the advantages of Shuwaikh area both as an Air Base and to any Oil Company operating in Kuwait, whether it would A. be possible for both Air and Oil requirements to be met side by side only experts can decide. Second Interview (£8.2.54) . This was mainly devoted to discussing the latest offer of the Kuwait Oil Company, which he, the Shaikh, was entirely dissatisfied with. (See separate note). The Shaikh then told me that he had that morning passed a hint to Mohamed Yatim (Major Holmes’ Confidential Agent) to the effect that possibly His Majesty’s Government would ask for the Shuwaikh area as an R.A.F. land and Flying Boat base and that he wanted his principals, Messrs: Holmes and Chisholm to realize beforehand that if their Company (The Kuwait Oil Company) had an eye on the area also, he, the Shaikh, would always give the preference to the Royal Air Force, as obviously any Royal Air Force base contemplated would be for the protection of the Oil Company before anything else* I here pointed out that in the Political Agreement which had been come to between His Majesty’s Government and the Kuwait Oil Company in London, I believed that there was a clause (though I had not yet seen it, the Agreement) to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had the prior right (with the approval of the Shaikh, of course) to select any sites, landing grounds etc., which the Royal Air Force might require for defensive purposes. The Shaikh seemed rather pleased than otherwiseotherwise to hear this, but expressed the wish that he had been put in possession of a copy of this Political A&amp;reement ** at the time the n Draft Oil Agreement ” had been handed to him, as it would have saved him someCONFIDENTIAL.

It is very satisfactory that no difficulty should arise about landing grounds (b) and (c), and, subject to your views, we are of opinion that it would be desirable at once to take advantage of the Sheikh's offer to loan them indefinitely to Government without rent subject to the proviso mentioned. 3. It is, of course, for tne Air Ministry to say how much importance they attach to securing area (a), but prima l&amp;cie there would seem, if your financial authorities agree, to be much to be said for taking up at once with the the Sheikh the question of what rent he would demand in respect/ Commander W.A. kcClaughry, D.S.O., k.C♦, D«F.C., Air kinistry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2.2 respect of it.

As regards the last paragraph of Dickson's telegram, it is in our view unnecessary to insert any special reference to these landing grounds in the Political Agreement, the terms of Clause 8 of which in its present form will cover all the areas in question if we decide to come to an arrangement with the .Sheikh in respect of them. 5.

My dear Laithwaite 'A r ith reference to your letter 1400/34 of 1st March 1934 ? and in confirmation of our telephone conversation to-day, we are very ready to accept the Sheikh*s offer regarding Landing Grounds (b) and (cj out, as we agreed on the telephone, it is probably best that we should deal with all three sites simultaneously when we know the cost of leasing site (a). 2* We have now ascertained from A.0.0. Iraq, that site (a) is required not only dn conjunction with the flying boat anchorage but also as a site upon which to accommodate one or more landplane units should conditions in the future make it desirable to locate such units in Koweit. The existing landing ground just outside Koweit Town is not considered suitable as a base for aircraft both for health and defence reasons. We would therefor© b© grateful if you could let us have site (a). 3. As regards paragraph 4 of your above quoted letter and with reference to your subsequent letter P.2.1825/24, dated 19th March 1934, and to the agreement attached therewith we agree that clause 8 of the agreement will probably cover the point you mention sufficiently. 4. The final sentence of clause 8 of the agreement, however, might be very inconvenient if the Company decide that site (a) and the anchorage opposite it are the only ones suitable for their purpose.

Owing to Hie recent visits of Colonel Ward,and Mr.Edmonds of the f Iraq foreign Oflice followed by the visits of the Mutasarrif of Basra and the American Minister, Baghdad (the second and last of whom stayed in my house) I was obliged to postpone my discussions with the Shaikh in the matter of the rent he was prepared to charge for area (a) Shuwaikh , till the 30th of March and 1st April. 3. Matters were delayed still further by my having to make a rather important and extended gout ^scme ^bJ miles in all) on 25th March, when I visited the camps of the large number of Mutair, Awazim, Aab and Adwan tribes vfco recently were forced to alter Kuwait territory from Nejd owing, to couplete lack of grazing in their own country. 4. To revert to the question of renta].: Tt» Shaikfi at my two interviews with him received me with more than usual courtesy and consideration, hut shov/ed distinct reluotanc e2 reluctance fco quote me a figure for the rent he expected to get irom us in the event of the Koyal Air Force deciding to lease the Shuwaikh site. He pointed out that he looked upon himself and Kuwait as part of the British liimpire, and when it came to the demanding of rent frcm the Boyal Air Force for an area they mi^it require for the possible defence of Kuwait, and the Kuwait Oil Company (should the latter get their concession), he felt faced with a real difficulty. It was of course up to him to assist, he said, in reducing the rent he would charge to as moderate a figure as he possibly could, seeing that the Royal Air Force were part of the armed forces of His Majesty^ Government etc. etc., but he felt that if he mentioned any figure at all he might fix on some thing too high and so be accused of ingratitude, or of trying to squeeze money out of His Majesty’s Government. This was the last thing he wanted, and he would, he said, far prefer that His Majesty’s Government, advi sed by me . should make him an offer, which would be fair to himself and agreeable to them. Were he dealing with a commercial concern, he added, he would know how to get the best for himself, but the Royal Air Force was a different proposition. 5* On my pointing out the unfairness of placing the burden of a decision on His Majesty’s Government, the Shaikh turned to me and asked me to fix myself what I thought a suitable and fair rental, assuring me that he had such entire faith in my sense of what was fair, that anything decided on would be acceptable. I continued however to press him for some sort of gi- figure, and eventuelly the Shaikh reluctantly agreed to £.1200/- per annum. 6. The above figure as I said in my telegram, I do not consider at all excessive, in view of the large and valuable property involved and in view of the fact that the Quarantine buildings would be thrown in also. One must always/always remember that in 1907, though I admit circumstances were then scmewbat different, we leased the same area from Shaikh Mubarak for Rs.60,000 per annum. 7. i of course mentioned to the Shaikh that the Royal Air for ce if indeed they ever took over the site had already agreed to abide by his conditions viz (a) to allow native craft to use the Shuwaikh harbour: (b) not to interfere with persons using the Kuwait-Basra road which passes through the property: (c) not to expect him (the Shaikh) td ever undertake repairs to the Quarantine buildings. This pleased the Shaikh. 8. i/hat stood out during the whole of our talks, was the fact that the Shaikh appeared genuinely anxious to assist and make things as easy as possible for the Royal Air Force 'for the simple reason that they were part and parcel of King George's fighting forces and so protectors of Kuwait' (his words). It is therefore not improbable that in the event of the figure £1200/- being considered excessive by the Air Ministry, I might be able to get the Shaikh to agree to a sli^itly further reduction. I, naturally however, would not like to try and beat him down further as it would rather savour of my trying to take an unfair advantage of his expressed loyalty to His Majesty’s Government. I think also that the Shaikh’s feelings would be considerably hurt, were I to try and. beat him down further.

My dear McClaughry, L V Many thanks for your letter of the 9th April, S.31084 (Pa-rtf II), about the acquisition of certain additional facilities for aircraft in Koweit in connection with the grant of an oil concession there. 2. I am taking up the point raised in paragraph 7 of your letter with our Legal Adviser and will write to you again about it in a day or two. 3. In the meantime, I should be grateful if you would consider the following point in connection with your paragraph 2. If the Air Ministry now decide not to take up site (a) but to rest content with the acquisition of rights valid against the Koweit Oil Company (if these can be secured) in respect of moorings for a ilying boat anchorage opposite the quarantine site, the risk oughu not 1d be overlooked that if eventually they require a base in mmander W. A. McC laughry, .0., M.C., D.F.C., Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C.2. Koweit/2 , Koweit territory additional to sites (b) and (o) they would, of course, have no rights against the Company in respect of any area already being developed by the latter and that it is presumably conceivable that no suitable area in which the Company were not interested might then be available. You may possibly if you think these considerations material wish to consider further the line to be taken with the Sheikh of Koweit as regards site (a). It is, of course, a nuisance that he will not sell this site outright, but (though it may be difficult to look a gift horse in the mouth, and his present offer is certainly not ungenerous from his standpoint when compared with the rent which he drew from us for many years for the Bunder Shweikh area) it might be possible to go back to him, if on further examination you thought that desirable, with some compromise proposition. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Pe t roleurn D e partment &lt; Yours sincerely, GILBERT LAITHWAITE.P.Z. 2408/34 AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, 9th April 1934 4 (Part II) &lt;rt My dear Laithwaite Will you please refer to my letter of the 20th March 1934, on the subject of acquisition of certain adaitional facilities for aircraft in Koweit and to Political Agent Koweit’s telegram of the 3rd instant in which he states that the Sheikh proposes to charge an annual rent of £1,200 for the quarantine site, previously referred to as site (a)* 2. While we agree that the Sheikh’s terms are probably not unreasonable and appreciate the fact that he wishes to help as far as he reasonably can, we regret that we do not feel justified in paying an annual rent of £1,200 perhaps for the next 20 years or more when there is no certainty that the site will eventually be required as a base to accommodate R.A#F. units. Also if that site should eventually be acquired by the oil company and we then find that a base is required in Koweit territory, it is possible that an alternative site could be obtained elsewhere, not necessarily so close to Koweit town. 3. It is perhaps a little unfortunate that after a certain amount of pressure had been brought to bear on the Sheikh to fix a rent which he would be prepared to accept, we should now decline his offer, but I fear this cannot be helped. Will you, therefore, please ask the Political Agent to decline the Sheikh’s offer as far as the quarantine site is concerned and, if you think it desirable, explain the reasons for our decision. .Laithwaite Esq., Lndia Office, S. W. 1. 4./4. At the same time we shall he grateful if you will 1 1 accept the Sheikh’s offer to let us have the sites at Jahra and Suhaihiya free of charge. We leave it to you to decide what form of agreement or exchange of letters is V necessary to put the matter on a formal basis, but would, of course, like the concession to extend for the longest possible period of time. 5. The only outstanding matter then is the need for a flying boat anchorage opposite the quarantine site and we shall be obliged if you can arrange with the Sheikh for us to be allowed to put down and maintain moorings there. We must, of course, accept the Sheikh’s stipulation contained in Political Agent Koweit’s telegram of the 27th February 1934, that the anchorage shall not be denied to local craft. 6. It is possible, of course, as we are not now taking up the quarantine site, that the oil company may do so and that they may develop a harbour t ere. In that event we may come up against the difficulty mentioned in your letter P.Z.1825/34, of the 19th March 1934, that Clause 8 of the Government Agreement provides that ’’harbours developed by the company shall be under its complete and exclusive control”. 7. As we have been informed by the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, that there is no suitable alternative anchorage for flying boats, this is a serious difficulty. We would suggest, however, that if a claim is now staked which allows us to put down moorings opposite the quarantine site, we might be covered by the first part of Clause 8 of the Government Agreement. We would be glad to have your views on this point and would also welcome any other suggestions as to how our requirement for a flying boat anchorage can now be safeguarded, and in any case would like you to obtain the necessary authority to put down moorings near the quarantine site./3 site. Presumably the Sheikh would not make any charge for this concession. 8.

WHITEHALL, 3.W. 1 13th April 1934 I^y aear McClaughry, tony thanks for your letter of the 12th April, 3.31084, about air facilities in Koweit. I note your views. We are sending copies of your letter to the political Resident ana the Political Agent, Koweit by to-day's air mail, with the connected correspondence. I doubt very much, on the otaer nana, if there is any real prospect of advance on the lines suggested in paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter. An alternative site, as suggested in paragraph 6, would, of course, meet the case. But your previous correspondence with the A.O.C. suggests that it will not be very easy to find one, 5 . Would you like to consider the following suggestion? (I cannot of course say to what extent it would have any prospect of going down with trie Sheikh). Your position is that it is important (ana may oe very important) to secure site (a) or a corresponding site in Koweit in view of possible ultimate development jin connection with Iraq or trie like/ Commander W.A. McClaughry, D.3.O., M.C., D.F.C., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W * G ♦ 2 •2 % like, and it is of course generally accepted that the strategic- importance of Koweit is potentially very great. On the other hand, the possibility of development which would necessitate the use of such a site is remote: it may well be that we should never have to use it at all, and in any event it is unlikely that it will be necessary to use it for many years to come. In those circumstances you not unnaturally see objection to paying so sue stuntiel a sum as £1,200 a year (or even half that amount) for a site of which you would be making no use. It might conceivably be possible for Dickson, if Fowls agreed, to take the line with the Sheikh that, as he was aware, we were merely anxious to secure area (a) as an insurance area in view ox the terms of tne Koweit Oil Company’s concession and the possibility of difficulty later if we do not take the necessary precautions now, that, on the other hand, there would be no unestion of our using this area, so far as we could at tne moment judge, for many years to come; that in these circumstances, while much appreciating the generous offer which had been made by the sheikh, we were reluctant to incur expenditure on the scale suggested; but that His Excellency might be prepared to cOiisidjr recognising the site in question as one reserved oy us for air facilities within the terms of the Governmentagreement wit^li t/hs KowGilj Oil Conipany ; on ins und-srsidnciing -.hat we shoula in fact take no action for some time to come jO develop it, that if ana when we aid find it necessary ' a fter reference to him) actively to develop the site, we you la pay him £1,200 (or a smaller figure if you thought 'it), hut that in the meantime, inasmuch as we should he paying merely for something which was only a reservation ind aid not involve any interference with the ordinary use )f the site hy its present occupants, the Sheikh, etc., we thought a nominal rent of some sort, say £100 a year, would prohahly meet the case. What would you think of action on these lines? We cannot, of course, say whether, even if the Resident thinks it sound, there would he any dixficulty with the sheikh. But it seems at any rate an avenue worth exploring, and, as I have mentioned aoove, it does appear, though that is, of course, a matter entirely for you to judge, to he orlma facie of real importance to acquire rights over this site valid against trie Koweit Oil Company.

I am sending copies of this letter to henael, seal ,nd Starling. Yours sincerely, J. o. laithwaite,gote by Legal Adviser, India Office, dated 13th April t i9M. I^ie primary subject matter of Clause 8 is sites - meaning apparently land sites - which have been selected by His Majesty 1 s Government for defence purposes or under heads specified in Clause 8* A flying boat achorage with moorings in the sea off this quarantine site (which I take it is in a harbour) would presumably come under the tf development of harbours' just as much as e.g. building jetties or buoying a deep-water channel. The clause contemplates the development of harbours (a) by His Majesty's Government with a proviso in favour of the Company in certain events; (b) by the Company in which case their control is complete and exclusive. The Company could not therefore object to His Majesty’s Government under the Sheikh’s authority putting down moorings, either now or later (now for choice). This does not get rid of the proviso to (a) above but seems preferable to allowing the situation in (b) to arise. If the sites contemplated by Clause 8 are not necessarily land sites, but might also include sea sites, it does not seem to lead to any useful conclusion in the present case to suggest that a demarcated area in the sea selected for seaplane moorings may itself be a site, because so long as it is in a harbour the proviso under Clause 8 would attach. On the question of the land site, it may be worth consideration whether, although acquisition of the particular site has, as regards the Sheikh, been refused for the present, it may still be open to His Majesty’s Government, as between the Company and His Majesty’s Government/Government under the present agreement, to say to the Company that the site has been selected. The contention seems a fair one that selection doee not necessarily involve actual or immediate acquisition and tailing over possession. Of course the Sheikh might not like this, if it came to his ears, and the suggestion has its perils inasmuch as in Clause 8 the expression is used for both parties and if we used it now the Company could certainly claim the same construction if it suited tnem.1 By Air Mail bio* wr ftn ^ r Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political De par traen t, In di a Office c India Office, Whitehall, London, Copy sent to S.W.l.

From:- The Hon , ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.P., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; To :- His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, the India Office, London. , yj*V' ■ o Sir, I have the honour to enclose copy of letter No. s' C-199, dated the 29th May 1934, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, with enclosures, from which it will he seen that the Shaikh has signed the Civil Air Agreement. This reflects credit on Colonel Dickson’s persuasive powers as the Shaikh at first evinced a certain amount of suspicion towards the Agreement, chiefly I thinkon account of its unavoidably voluminous nature. With regard to paragraphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter. The reason why Bahrain in the first place (paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter) came to be given £.120/- per annum, and Kuwait nothing, is I imagine quite simple. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked for £.120 per annum and the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for nothing. The reason, too why the Shaikh of Kuwait gave the use of his landing ground rent- free, and the Shaikh of Bahrain asked for rent, is I think not far to seek. Kuwait being part of the mainland in case of emergency is largely dependent on the Royal Air Force for protection, and Bahrain being an island is not: as long as His Majesty’s Sloops are in the Persian Gulf no force can invade Bahrain from the mainland. In other words the coming of the Royal Air Force to Kuwait was more in the interests of the latter than of the former, while in Bahrain it was the Royal Air Force who chiefly benefited since Bahrain is an essential link in the strategical route to India, and no corresponding advantage of2 advantage of defence accrued to the State. 3. Moreover Bahrain and Kuwait in the matter of landing grounds are not on all fours. At the former there are two landing grounds; (a) On Manamah Island, for use of which the Royal Air Rorce pay the £.120/- rent referred to by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and which is now practically a military aerodrome. Rurther the £.120/- not only covers the use of the aerodrome but also the site for the Royal Air Rorce base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, etc. which is situated on Manamah. (b) On Muharraq Island which is the civil aerodrome the use of which by the Royal Air Rorce is given free under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement. At Kuwait there is only one aerodrome, corresponding to that on Muharraq, and no base. 4. I am not of opinion therefore that the Shaikh has any claim to the £.120/- in connection with the Civil Air Agreement, and I suggest that I be authorised to send him the attached letter. I have not mentioned in my draft the arguments contained in paragraph 2 above but the Political Agent, Kuwait, when presenting the letter might at his discretion elaborate these en titre persons1. The Shaikh is not backward in stressing His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to him and it does no harm, I think, from time to tire to point out to him the corresponding benefits which he receives. 5 # ^rom the last paragraph of the Shaikh’s letter it is quite possible that while relinquishing the request for the £.120/- rental he may state that he wishes to charge duty on Royal Air Rorce fuel as is done by the Bahrain otc^te. If he does so this point can be taken up on its merits. In connection, however, with a possible future Royal Air Rorce base at Kuwait,(vide correspondence ending with Secretary of State for India’s telegram No.1193, dated the 6th May 1934) for the option on the site of which £.100£.100 yearly rental to the Shaikh has been suggested, I think that this might be raised to £.120, which as far as bases are concerned would then place Kuwait on a level with Bahrain, and satisfy the Shaikh. I am sending a copy of this letter and of its enclosures (except sub-enclosure(a) of which only one spare copy is available) to the Government of India.

To His Excellency Shaikh/Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, C.S.I., Ruler of Kuwait. J, Vi v&gt;Si° I have the honoutr to refer to Your Excellency’s letter No.R4/15 18 of 12th Safar 1355 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Kuwait, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty’s C-overnment to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrain State are paid an annual rental of '120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3- His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: “^t is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference bet, ween conditions at Bahrain and Kuwait. At Bahrain there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which the Royal Air Force pay the £.120/- referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened and the other on Muharrac, which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the'same agreement has been signed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad as hasbeen signed by you. 4 # At Kuwait there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s Government regret there fore that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £.120- which is paid to Bahrain, and Your Excellency in the light ofthe above facts will doubtless see that conditions in the two states are materially different^CQNFID :NTIAL.

Dear Colonel Towle, Please refer to your D.O.Ho.514—S f dated the 2nd June 1934 to Dickson. y% 2. As the Shaikh had apparently dropped his 'face savingscheme - vide this Agency Express Letter , o.0-203 dated the 31st May 1934 - and you mentioned to me in Bushire that you agreed with Dickson’s view that the acceptance by the Shaikh of the Political Agreement ipso facto had settled the question of the Chief Local Representative, Dickson and I considered we would be justified in approach ing the Shaikh on the points raised in your D.O. quoted above. 3 . ♦ I was unable unfortunately to be present at the interview as an Arab dinner I had to attend the night before had completely bowled me over. Dickson therefore went alone and I enclose the notes he wrote of his discussion with the Shaikh. 4 . As regards point 'A': The conditions laid down by the Shaikh seem reasonable. If you approve and the *.A.F. agree I could get the Shaikh's formal sanction by an exchange of letters. On obtaining the Shaikh’s letter I could, if you see no objection, then reply to Cunningham's D.O. to Dickson No.S.108X5/4 of 22nd May, of which a copy was sent you, and ask him to send down an officer to select the sites. 5 . As regards point 'B': In 2 years the R.A.P. ought to be able to decide whether they will want site 'A' or not and I think therefore the Shaikh's condition might be accepted Yours sincerely, 1 lAA U) be Hon’ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRS.COHfflDMTIAL, Notes of an interview between Lt,-Colonel H.H.P.Dickson, » Politioal Agent, Kuwait, and His Excellency the Shaikh held at 9.30 A.M. on 16th June 1934 (Major Watts being unable to attend owing to indisposition)# POINTS DISCUSSED. L .^ ^ (a) Baghdad Air Headquarters D.0, letter (Secret) No.S# 10815/4, dated the 22nd May 1934, enquiring if the Shaikh could be approached with a view to formal permission being obtained for the R.a.F, to ley down mooring buoys in the vicinity of the old Naval pier, situate in the Shuwaikh Harbour anchorage* See para 4 of Notes forwarded to Bush ire under Kuwait Secret letter No*C-85, dated 1st March 1934 and Colonel Fowle’s r V Confidential D.0.No.514-3 of 2nd June 1934. P ' 1 O (b) Whether Shaikh would agree to accept £#100 per annum for the Shuwaikh area as a whole J/j 3 6 known as 1(a). (See India Office telegram fto.464 dated the 20th February 1934 and Kuwait telegram No.74 dated the 27th February to India Office and Bushire), pending development of site, and there- t after £#1200$- per annum. (See India Office T * ' f telegram No. 1194 of 6 th May and previous corres pondence). I commenced by telling His Excellency that I xiad come to bid him 'Good bye', as I was leaving for London in the morning at 4 A.M. on my four months leave, details of which he was aware of• His Bxoellency was gracious in the extreme and after expressing very great regret that I was going, said that he was in a sense glad because it would enable me to give a personal account of my stewardship to the authorities in London, and especially would assist me in explaining his, the Shaikh's, point of view in several matters now outstanding. 3./- 2 - 3. After these preliminaries I opened question (a) above, and while apologizing for discussing business when my visit was really a 'farewell' one, I asked if he would permit mooring buoys to be laid down by the R*A*F* in the near future, to enable them to get a sheltered anchorage for their flying boats when these visited Kuwait, as they often did* The Shaikh readily agreed, pointing out that Shusraikh was the obvious place for our Flying Boats, and emphasizing once again that he was always out to help the fighting services of His Majesty’s Government to the best of his power. He, however, felt bound to make the following conditions purely to safeguard the ri#ts of his own people and local shipowners:- (i) Kuwait Sailing Craft at all times to be allowed full use of the whole of Shuwaikh harbour, there being no question of the R.A.F, denying them access to the harbour, or any part of it. (ii) That if possible the mooring buoys should be placed at the westerly end of the harbour so as to be interfered with as little as possible by sailing craft entering or leav ing the harbour. (ill) That the B.a.F. Officer told off to lay tlie moorings should work in cooperation and in company with one of his (the Shaikh s officials when selecting the actual site for the mooring buoys in question, as the latter could point out dhow anchorages and assist generally, and misunderstandings would be avoided. N0T]j! . ?or the information of those rho do not know Kuwait, the Shuwa ikh anchorage is normeily empty. 14 ls however/It is howsrer used by every 'lost Indian xoan* arriving from Zanzibar or India, wlicse does not penalt of entry into the docking areas situate in front of the Town. These ships unload their cargo at dhiMaikh and later enter the recognized docking areas. It is imperative that these ships be not interfered with or denied entry into the Shuwaikh harbour, else they cannot discharge. The harbour is also used for laden sailing craft arriving in a stem or when the tide is at ebb, as a temporary 'refuge' where they can get shelter. The writer cannot visualize a situation arising where sailing craft would interfere with air moorings, if the latter were placed out of the immediate fair way and at the western end of the harbour as the available water expanse is very great. d. I next turned to the question of the land area 1(a) which the R.A.9. hope to acquire at a later date at an agreed rental of £.1200 per annum, but which they find it incoiivenisnt to take up at present. In very general terms I explained to His Excellency that what .the rUA.i 1 . proposed was to give him the Shaikh £«100/«* per annum for the time being, which payment to give than so to speak a lien on the area in question('Araboon' as the Arabs call it) , so that in the event of their deciding to take up the area permanently at a later date which they hoped would be the case, they would be able to do so without difficulty. Further that when that time arrived, they, the R.A.F., were quite prepared to pay his, the Shaikh's, figure of £.1200, as rental. 5. His Excellency who throughout our talk seemed interested, and listened with marked courtesy to all my points, pointed out that, although he would prefer an immediate settlement, he would agree to the arrangement proposed out of friendship for myself and for His Majesty's condition only, namely that the Government, but on one~ 4 - that tlie arrangeiHent should be considered a temporary one amt not extend beyond two years. In other words that the R.A.F* could leave the question of definitely taking up the area they had their eye on^open” for the next 2 years only, but that at the arid of that period they must decide either (a) to give up all idea of renting the area in question and cease paying him £.100 a year or (b) take up the land for good at a rental of f.lEOO per annum* He, the ohaiidti, could not allo^ the R.A.F* to go on for an unlimited period keeping their lien on such valuable land. This was only fair to himself. 6. At this stage, I thought it best to close the interview, and promised to convey the gist of our talk, which I emphasized was made without prejudice, to His Majesty’s Government through Major Watts and the Political Resident. 7. Before I left the Shaikh remarked that both / matters (a) and (b) above could be conveniently settled by an exchange of letters with my successor (Major Watts) to which I agreed. 8. I have no comments to make beyond saying that the Shaikh’s points seemed to me highly reasonable, and that in both cases I think the R.A.P. would do well to agree out of hand with the Shaikh’s conditions.

As the treasury authority allowing us to the offer enables the Air Ministry to pay a mm of about £100 a year for the reservation of the site we will certainly not allow the negotiations to fall through over a small addition of ££G per annum if the lie eluent and Political Agent consider it necessary to offer the higher figure* fh&amp;t being so, you can inform the Be si dent that we will be prepared to pay £120 per annum for reservation of the quarantine site on the terns previously agreed between us in correspondence ending with ^ letter S.31084^~^4eir April* k ^ as' far as paragraphs 4-*■6 of colonel Dickson* s letter arid per agrees 2-4 of colonel Powle’a letter are oonoerned, the latter explaina rery clearly the difference between the position at Bahrain and hoveit. ~&gt; 4 , Koweit is obTiouely moh saore lively t0 require B.A.l'. asoistance than Bahrain and has, in fact, been given such assistance on more than one occasion, and, therefore, it wars quite as much in the interest of the Sheikh of Koweit himself as of the B.A.F. that our lending ground was established in his territory. 5. Moreover, there is a further consideration which has not been mentioned by the Resident and that is, that the olvil base at Bahrain is much more important than the civil landing ground at Koweit. Koweit will provide less uaithw&amp;ito, Maq., ^ . traffic, la Office, ,diitraffic thaa Bahrain and owing to its ptmAmitp to Basrah will probably bo used xmoh less than the latter place# That being so a asaaUsr suia will bo collected at Kowelt in respect fees of landing /than at Bahrain* but nevertheless the Sheikh of the former place is being paid the same amount in respect of the civil air agreement as the Sheikha of Bahrain and Ow&amp;clur.

In the event of our eventually establishing &amp; ji.A. . base at KO«eit the sum involved in payaent of duty on fuel sight oe quite considerable and it is possible the ^eiich might also wish to charge duty on other classes of H.a.f. stores, the bill for which would, no doubt, be considerable. 1 'hat being so, it is obviously desirable to avoid establishing any precedent in the matter of payment of duty on B.iuF. fuel at this stage if at ©11 possible# 8 . i am sending copies of this letter to Bends! at the Foreign Office, seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department# yours sincerely, (Sgd) W,A. .©Olaughry#C+tfi* 'd-rt&gt; -, 6) / fU. o x j&gt; 4^^ OY-/- c!?. ^ V , C ^tJ r&lt; fi C A. ^iO&gt; ^ ^ ^ ^ L*^j * p--&gt;v\/~Cc ^ u f ■ Hot# or a coavornat ion botwacm coloaoi ^owXo anil HI® IxooXXoaoy 31 iaX^ch 31 r ^bimd 9 3aXor of Kinfalt f oa 18 uh July, 19S4 at whioh Major Watt®, ; olltloal Agent, ,.\nrait t was present, on th® subject of fitb regard to the halkb’a contention that while Bahrain wan getting a £*X20 ?®r amuua from the Royal Air TaFQB In addition to what they reoelvod un^er the -dvil Air Agre^ent, he - the haikh - was only receiving the rent provided for by the Civil Air Agreement, X took the following line:- 2* te* Major &gt;attB had already pointed out to the shaikh, there were 8'*concessions” in Bahrain: 1* The Civil aerodrome in uharraq covered by the Civil Air /agreement; 2 # the Royal Air bro© aerodwme and Royal Air Force base in ?'Bnmas.h for which the £.120 was paid, Likewise there were in Kuwait * -concessional t -rhe Civil Aerodrome covered by the civil Air Agreement; 2.

In these notes tne Sheikh of Kcweit is stated to have agreed to allow us to have a lien upon the quarantine site (area 1(a)) at an annual rent of £100 for two years only, afoer whicn time we are required to say definitely whether or not we -wish to take up the site for development as an air case at an annual rental of £1200. I fear that such an arrangement will he of very little use to us as it is highlyuuniikely that we snail he able to make our decision witnin so shoro a time. It is difficult to estimate what period is likely to elapse before we need made any decision on this point, out so far as if is possible to estimate now, five or six years would seem to be the minimium period whlmi &gt;aou 1 u oe any use to us* If we have to maKe an estimate I think t^n years would be a more suitable period, though, naturally it is very much preferable that we snouiu not have to specify any definite period. 1/ Laithwaite, nsq•, India Office, ' 3.W.

Amongst other matters which were then discussed was the question of Your Excellency giving permission for the R,A.F. to lay down mooring buoys in the vicinity of the old Naval Pier situated in the Shuwaikh Harbour anchorage for the use of their Flying Boats when these visited Kuwait, 3. I understand that Your Excellency was good enough to agree to the laying down of the buoys in that area subject to the followingoonditions; (i) Kuwait sailing craft at all times to be allowed full use of the whole of ohuwaikh Harbour, there being no question of the R.A.F. denying them access to the harbour, or any part of ii. (ii) That if possible the mooring buoys should be placed at the westerly and of the harbour so as to be interfered with as little as possible by sailing craft entering or leaving the harbour, (iii) That the R.A.F, Officer told off to lay the moorings should work in cooperation and in company with one of Your Excellency^ officials when selecting the actual site for the mooring buoys in question, as the latter could point out dhow anchorages and assist generally, and misunderstandings would be avoided, 4.

As far # as fuel required for aircraft passing through Kuwait on passage up and down the Gulf is concerned, this duty would probably be quite negligible, but it might be pointed out to the^ Shaikh that he would, in any case, hardly be justified in charging duty on fuel in respect of flights of an operational character which might be undertaken in his own interests. 7. There is another aspect, however, in connection ijlfl with this question of duty which I would like to bring to your notice. In the event of our eventually establishing a , I R.A.F.base at Kuwait the sum involved^in payment of duty on fuel might be quite considerable and it is possible the | Sheikh might also wish to ch rge duty on other classes of^ m' R,A.F.stores, the bill for which would, no doubt, be consider able. That being so, it is obviously desirable to avoid establishing any precedent in the matter of payment of duty fi il on R.A.F.fuel at this stage if at all possible. 8.

The Hesiaent thinks that we might try to get the Sheikh to agree to rent us tne Bunder shweikh site for, say, five years at £120 a year on the understanding that thereafter (or at an earlier stage if we started to make active use of and to exercise our option over it) we should pay him at the rate of £1200 a year.

My dear Dickson, v I was interested-- j to see in para. 119A of your Intelligence Summary No. 9 that there was a good prospect of something happening in the negotiations between the Kuwait Oil Company and the Shaikh before the start of Ramadhan. Although as you know the Air Ministry has decided not to lease any land from the Shaikh for the present, we shall be interested to follow the activities of the Oil Company and shall be very interested to know if they commence operations in the area which was under consideration as air base. I have no doubt that news on this subject will be included in your Intelligence Summary, but on the A.O.C’s behalf I am writing to ask you whether, should there be an item of information which you think might be of interest to us which you do not intend to include in your Intel 1 igence Summary, you would send it to us privately.

Yon will have seen from my last Intelligence Summary that the Kuwait Oil Company did, as I anticipated, get their Oil Concession out of the Ahaikh. The negotiators immediately afterwards went home, to arrange for geologists and engineers to come out and survey the country. These I expect will arrive about February* 3 # You may take it as pretty certain, I think, that should Oil eventually be discovered to the oouth of Kuwait Town, i.e. -^outh of Kuwait bay , the eventual Oil exporUng Port will be located at nhuwaikh seeing that no other sheltered harbour Is available on the main coast line racing (west end of Kuwait Bay) will be Hie site selected for the the sea. 4, Should, on the other hand, Oil be /^covered iWt.h nf the jav of Kuwait, it is probable, I think, that the deep water bay known as the Khor Kadhama opposite ^asr adhazaa future Oil Port of Kuwait. This is where the Germans Intended in the pre-war days, that the Ber Un-Baghdad railway should have its eventual debouch, and have its terminus on the Persian Gulf littoral 5./ ■air Commodore J.A.Vachell, M.C.,p.s.a.

She facilities required with which I am concerned cau be divided into two categories: A. Territories where we have obtained general facilities under respective Civil Air Agreements. This comprises Nos.l, 3, 8 and 12. B. This comprises two areas in Abu Dhabi territory (Nos .4 and 6) and Kalba (No .9). In the former territory we have merely obtained certain specific facilities limited to areas Nos.5 ana ? Kalba territory we have obtained no facilities at all. 5 # i agree, however, with the.-vir Ministry (paragrapn 3 of their letter of 18th January) that in the territories in A (Kos.l, 3, 8 and 12) the extra facilities now required can he installed as a matter of course and without raising the subject with the Shaikhs. Should the latter make objections we can quite fairly explain to them that the be a cons, wireless and meteorol ogica l stations are part of the normal organization connected with landing grouna-s • 6. Category 3 is however on a different footing'. 7, Before I give an opinion on the best way oi obtaining facilities in territories under category B I would be grateful if I could be assured that these represent the final -equi: ■ ~ ments of the Air Ministry, at all events for a period of say two years . a piecemeal method of obtaining air facilities from Shaikhs, as 1 pointed out before, renders a far roi- easy task still more difficult, and may also prove more expensive , t-p 1 'Vip information, x or 2.n3taiico, to His Majesty 1 s Government. - - he ±n • ^ at Halul and Das Islands had been as to the air Xacilj-t^es a^ ..an-~ received / im-3- received by me in time it would have been convenient to have tried to obtain them at the same time as the others dealt with by Colonel Loch inhis recent negotiations (vide my letter of 22nd February already quoted). 8. If therefore there is any doubt as to whether any further facilities should be added to the. Air Finis try List it would be much preferable that further consideration should be given to this matter. This further consideration may lead to a slight delay in dealing with the facilities un^er category B, but in the meantime the Royal Air Force can commence installing those under category A. sd.

It may prove desirable to lay down a hard runway, but a definite decision on this point cannot be made the at the present time. As described by Mr* Entwistle, it is desirable that a meteorological observation station should be established at Kuwait. Subject to the concurrence of the India Meteorological Department, Mr.Entwistie suggests that suitable men of local origin should be trained in^ ^ making observations, and paid for their services. It is i quite possible that the establishment of such a station V. will involve securing a small plot for the erection Ox a meteorological office and for the installation of the instruments used for observation* I understand that you consider the employment ox local talent would oe veiy 1 desirable* BAHRAir* is Drol3able that the facilities at Bahrain will need to be' extended- Additions may have to be ma e to the W/T Station, as it will be necessary to suhstitat Adcock direction-finding equipment for the existing Bellini-Tosi, The signal station will also hav to keep longer hours of watch. This haccomodl- in staff, and presumably an increase -n living tion. It may also be found necessar y to provide extended facilities for passengers . _ It ^ v ery h-. the moment to translate such expansion into te.ms of buildings, land, etc* HALUL ISLAND. infl ,- ca t e d in the schedules forwarded, + are confined to the location requirements at this island are --unattended' of an airway beacon, ais will De^o^^^ Ume type, but naturally will ■«-/« -• • c i ear that it is to time.

It will be necessary tc instal an airway beacon of the 'unattended' type on this island* Subject to final confirmation from the Air Ministry, a landing ground will not be needed* SHARJAH , The provision of additional accommodation for passengers is at present under consideration. Extension of the «f/T organisation will probably necessitate still further accommodation. At present I understand that in your judgment conditions do not permit of the construction of such accommoda tion outside the fort. KAL3A , An emergency landing ground with a petrol store, and possibly some sort of shelter for passengers is required. From information available, the provision of such a ground would appear tc be easier 4t Kalba than at Dibah, although should, for any reason, it prove impossible to proceed with Kalba, Dibah might be substituted. The ground at Kalba would be kh used only in case of an emergency, but would need to be of dimensions adequate for the requirements of civil aircraft, and would have to be maintained up to the proper ^standard, Maintenance, of course, would not be the responsibility or. the Shaikh. It is desirable that an airway^beacon ('un attended' type) should be erected at Kalba/Dibah. DSBaI - HAS AL KKAlHAH. Imperial Airways have actually asked fox’ Jeoai as their refuelling halt, but in view oz the experience^ o-l the Royal Air Force, it would appear that Has ai Khaiman is better suited for such purpose* The alighting area at ^ Debai is confined, and under certain conditions Ox tuae an^ wind, it would toe difficult to take off a heavily loaded flying boat. This v/ill be brought to the notice of Imperial Airways, and the Company will be advised to establish thei^ refuelling halt at Has al Khaimah in preference to debai. At whichever site is finally selected, it will oe necet.sarj to arrange for facilities for passengers, is nne commercial responsibility of the Company, ana will probably mean the provision of some form o. crait, sui-a-ly e , lying at anchor, or a building on shore. The petrol company catering for the aircraft will also need storage acil.ties. W/T facilities will also have to be arranged between the refuelling point and the main signal station at Q..ar^ .. This may involve the establishment of a small il/ l ^ f'f R +v a 0 . ishor^fr possibly it may be found convenient to locate this onboard a suitable vessel. koorings v.il ^ for the use seap^nes, and the Air Ministryjoula arran 0 vessels wilfperiodicall^have to be brought ashore for overhaul, etc. The above organisation will necessitate the employment of a conoiuera ovidedi&gt; individuals for wbom bousing will ba ^ 2. It is understood that arrangements have^already been-3- made for the following: ABU DHABI o YAS ISLAMD . Airway Deacon. Airway beacon and landing ground. 3&gt; GWADUR o As explained, it will be necessary to extend the W/T and meteor organisations at Gwadur* This will involve additional buildings and masts in the vicinity of the town and of the aerodromeo The precise scheme is in process of formulation o 4o 1 trust the above will give you a satisfactory outline of the programme which it is proposed to develop. As stated at the discussion, I will endeavour to get from Imperial Air ways as definite a statement as possible df the facilities for which their Company is responsible, but you will appreciate the difficulty of indicating in advance precise details. 5.

With regard to the observations in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the express letter dated 19th March last from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I am to say that, while the attached schedule sets out the complete require ments so far as they can at present be estimated, some minor modifications may be involved as a result of further consideration of the requirements of the air service. 4.

Yours sincerely, ted) 0.0* HlOT.3. (a) In view of our rights under the respect ire Agree ments, no question arises of seeking permission f r0 m the £ uler for the right to instal the facility. (b) thtre an additional facility is required to be installed within the limits of the aerodrome in use, again no question of permission arises, (c) She ct»se may arise where additional facilities involve the cor,.traction of builsUnge, &gt;//? B®«te etc., on jbnu outside the limits of the a.rodroae. In this case also there is no question of obtaining permission fa- the right to instal t,.e lacilitie.. The questien of the ownership of the l and , however, does arise, as the site required may be {%) w&amp;ste laud, or ( 2 ) cultivated or occupied land. In the cf ee of (1), in mp opinion, no payment need be rni'de. i he Euler would be informed that the site was required, and the burden of proving that its use would infringe a public ri^ht (such as right of way) or a private easement would lie on the Euler. In the case of (2) a similar procedure would be followed with the addition that compensation would have to be paid for the use of the site# 4 . The foregoing, relates to additional facilities to existing aerodromes. In the case of additional civil aero* dr ones being required a distinction exists between our rights under the Civil fir Agreements with the a tiler e of K.u*a it, Bahrain and Muscat on the one hand, and of Shsrj&amp;h on the other in the case of the former we have the right to establish more thT'D /3 more thrn one aerodroiae end the e one i derat ions in paragra h 3 above *?ouId appj^y in the ease of any fresh sites required. In the c&amp;ae of the la tier the Agreement relates onl^ to the site eel acted and now in uae, end any additional eerodromee sill require to be freshly negotiated for. 3. the opinion le expreaeed in the second paragraph of Air Ministry letter Bo*423224/3b/l&gt;.o.l, dated tne 22nd October 193b t that it should suffice for me to inform the Shaikh of : harjjali of the removal of the n/t Station to the ne^ sites proposed and to get his assurance that they #111 be adequately covered by the Defence Scheme now in force in Sharjah. The guarding of these buildings* however* constitutes a fresh cozaraitment* not covered by the terms of the Shaikh’s agreement tvith us* end 1 think it very likely that he will refuse to accept the additional responsibility unless he is compensated fey seme payment* say in the fora of wages for guards, it may* however* be peas Able to construct the build ngo in *s uch a m&amp;nner that no normal guarding will be required* or to detach for this duty a few guards from those stationed at the Best House.

I hi ve merely mentioned it here to illustrate the 1 imitations of our Agreement with the ahaikh of Sharjah. 6. finally* in all oaees* in order to prevent delay and obstruction* it is essential that adequate notice should be given to the Political Authorities of any work proposed to be carried out in order that the Her and other persons concerned /concern*** (l.e. poeaiDle prirate o n«rr» of lend which nmy be required) m.y be notified, fend feny arrange^ente made that way be called for.CONFIDENTIAL.

Should they strike oil they will develop it fully, as they c re entitled to do ; save for the following reservation which comes in Article 3 of the Agreement between the Kuwait Oil Company and His Britannic Majesty’s Government:- 'Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreement 'bet veen the Company and the Shaikh the Company shall not 'have the right to use or occupy, and shall not include 'in the areas selected for the purposes ot its operations, 'any sites which may have been selected by or on be halt of 'the Shaikh or His Majesty’s Government for defence purposes] 'for aerodromes, aeroplane or seaplane bases or for wire- 'less and telegraph installations or in connection with the 'development of harbours, provided that with the consent 'of His Majesty’s Government which shall not be unreasonably 'withheld the Company shall have the right to use for the 'purposes of its operations such harbours as may be develop©* 'by the Shaikh or His Majesty’s Government if there is not 'reasonable harbour accommodation available elsewhere. 'Harbours developed by the Company shall be under its 'complete and exclusive control •- 2 - Once however development has begun the Air Ministry will have no rights against the Company In respect of any area already developed (See India Office Letter P.Z.2408/34 of the 10th Apri: 1934,Mr .Gilbert Laithwaite to (iing Commander iueClaughry). It will be remembered that the Air Ministry dropped the idea of a two years option at £.120 a year as being too short an option but/is not too late to take up a rental at the figure already quoted (£*1200) should His Britannic Majesty’s Government wish to do so, 4, It seems conceivable that the Admiraltyas well as the Air Ministry, and even perhaps the Committee of Imperial Defence may be interested to know that this site which has three times figured in the history of Imperial Communications (1775,1907 and 1914) is at last to be developed and will in a few months cease to be available for the use of His Britannic Ma je sty * s Government • 5, As the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq has pointed out there is no suitable alternative sea plane mooring place on this coast. There is no other large landing ground with a town by it in this area except at Kuwait nor any other anchorage within a few yards of the shore and so good as in this area. 5 , I have the honour to suggest therefore and before it is too late that the value of this site in a territory under British protection should be once more considered, since it seems to form a potential base, aAternative to 3asra, which place in certain circumstances might not he available, and to be too valuable to abandon for the sake of the sum (£.1200 per annum) for which a lease can be obtained for the whole area; a portion if desired being sublet or re**leaseu i or use of the Kuwait Oil Company.

In reply 1 am to state, for the information of the Marquess of Zetland, that in view of a recent decision to replace the squauron of flying boats now stationed in the Persian culf by a land plane squadron in due course, it is no longer considered that the Bunder ahuvaikh site, which was intended to be used, as a seaplane anchorage, is of sufficient value to justify any attempt to prevent the Koweit Oil Company from developing the site for their own purpose. It is unuerstooa from the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Ira^., that no difficulty is anticipated in making suitable arrangements for the use of thissite with the Koweit Oil Company and the Sheikh of Xoweit subsequent to the development of the site,should at any time such use be desirei, for Air Force purposes* The Council would, however, be glad If an assurance can be given that nothing has transpired which will in any way interfere with existing rights to make use of the landing grounds at Jahran, dubaihiya and at oweit town* I am, &amp;c«, (Cgti.)
