For purposes of this kind the two sides of the Gulf are inextricably tied up together and I think we are justified in putting to the Treasury a proposal for the sanction of the whole sum of Rs. 32,300 and not merely Rs. 25,000 which is earmarked for the Arab side of the Gulf. ?

EXT. 4186/46 //W/' • Dear James, At the beginning of the war the Committee of Imperial Defence approved a recommendation that £^,000 should be placed at the disposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Culf for special Juitelligence matters including payments to the Sheikhs if necessary, the allocation of this expenditure as between the United H Kingdom and India to be determined in accordance with the A^-/4 A general principles which may govern the allocation of // war expenditure between the United Kingdom and India. 2. Some time ago we received a letter from the Government of India dated 4th December, a copy of which is enclosed, from which it appeared that the sum of Rs. 50,000 (£3&gt;750) ha^C been provided annually during the war by the Government of India in the Political Residency Budget for special // intelligence matters and booked as special wartime H expenditure. The Government of India asked for H.M.G*s sanction for the provision of the sun of Rs. 40,000 in the Budget for 1946-7•• 3« We accordingly approached the Foreign Office but they felt that further information was required about the expenditure in question before sanction could properly be considered here. We accordingly wrote back to the Government of India and have now received their letter of 30th April enclosing one froax the Political Resident ( '» •£*-*'/ dated 6th April /in- wnioh They now as^^far H.M.G’s A concurrence in the expenditure of up to Rs« 32,500 during 1946-7 &gt; of which Rs. 25 &gt;000 is earmarked for the Political Residenc^aia and Agencies of the Arab Coast and Rs.7&gt;500 for ^hd^^outh pf' Persia.4* The Foreign Office view on this is that since it has recently been de J * ■* ^ x ’ ■ * ' '' ’ “ ' ’ //V/* sistS? / Political Resident shall be confined to fehe Arab side Political Reside Arab side of the-^uPf—{t^-Rea44#acy- is new-beiTi^~transferred to ^ ndtu Bahrein) any expenditure which nay find necessary to incur in regard to South Persia will only be for the purpose of obtaining information to assist him in his duties On the Arab Sheikhdoms. 5. It should be explained that for such purposes as obtaining information regarding piracy, smuggling and slave traffic the two sides of the Persian Gulf are closely connected. The kind of case which might arise might be one of suspected slave traffic from Persian Baluchistan to one of the Trucial Sheikhdoms^' £n order to stop such a traffic it might well ^ \ . | necessary for the Political Resident to take steps to secure information in Persian Baluchistan as well as on the Trucial Coast. we therefore think that the authority to spend a certain proportion of the grant on the Persian Coast is essential for the Political Resident even when his main activities sire on the Arab side. 6. We should accordingly be glad to know whether the Treasury the provision of iriiii mi nf up to Rs.32,500 in the Residency Secret Service Grant for the year 1946-7, the expenditure to be classified as Especial consular and ackninistrative expenditure in the Persian Gulf#, the incidence of which between H.M.G. and the The general question of the division of expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf will i.

The Government of India propose that the expenditure should be classified at present as 'special consular and administrative expenditure in Persia”, the incidence of which is to be settled later, 3. This revised proposal seems to us very reasonable and I hope you will feel that there is now sufficient information to enable you to r '_ take the matter up with the Treasury.

Description of this grant by Baxter in the enclosure to India Office express letter quoted by you 'as payment of funds for the acquisition of secret information By the Political Resident Persian Gulf' is inadequate there- f ore incorrect • 3. The grant is spent as was intended, not only in obtaining infonnation regarding piracy, smu gg ling, dis affection etc but in presents to those who have helped us or who are likely to be of use to us. It is particularly neces sary in order to retain our hold (on which depends our ability to move about safely) on the Arab coast in areas of o*l and political development like Kuwait, Qatar, and the ifia .Crucial Coast and Oman, and this need is likely to increase rather than to decrease. To meet these requirements a sum of not less than Rs 25,000/- is required for the three Arab coast agencies, the Political Residency and the frucial Coast. 4. T have carefully considered Gralloway’s previous estimate and consider that it can now be reduced by Rs 7500/- only Rs 7500/- per annum being provided for the Consulates or Kerman Bandar Abbas, Busnire (including Lingeh) and Khorramshahr. This compares with approximately Rs/2,000/- spent in these areas before the war as money is now of course about one-quarter its pre-war value.

W. 1. ' '* 30th January, 1946, i ; . 953 I 946 V. J Please refer to your letter No. Ext, 6924A5 of the 15 th January regarding the continued payment of funds for the acquisition of secret information 'by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I fear it would be impossible for us to take up with the Treasury the question of the continued payment of these funds without first being supplied with much more information than we have at present. All we know up to date is that the Political Resident states he cannot do with less than i|.OjOOO Rupees and the Treasury are unlikely to consider such a statement as sufficient justification. We are, furthermore, doubtful whether the expenditure in question, although controlled from Bushire, comes within the scope of the arrangements for sharing diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, etc. (c. W. Baxter) ■ E. P. Donaldson, Esq., C.M.G. , India Office.Please see Express Letter from the Govern ment of India below. In 1938 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf said that in case of war it was essential that a sum be placed at his disposal for special intelligence and special payments to the Sheikhs etc. (PZ. 6693/38). He suggested subsequently that the sum of 50,000 rupees to begin with would be sufficient (PZ.7426/38.) The Government of India agreed to this and stated that in their opinion the expenditure should be excluded from the divisible expenditure of the Residency and its incidence regulated in the light of the purposes for which it was incurred and the general principles which might govern ... i the allocation of war expenditure between the 5 ' I United Kingdom and India. (PZ.7621/38). In 1939 the Middle East Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence agreed that p ^ the sum of £4,000 should be placed at the ! disposal of the Political Resident for special 1 kZk ! intelligence matters. (M.H. (0)294 and PZ. 1132/39) 1 | including payment to the Sheikhs if necessary. 1946 j The Government of India have now written to say that after consultation with the Political Resident they propose to provide Rs.40,000 in the Budget of 1946-7 for the purpose of maintain ing intelligence which was inadequately financed before /N before the war, and request H. M.G.'s agreeiaent. Presumably they mean by this that provision be made in the Residency Budget which is divisible in moieties between EM.G. and the Government of India, since it is clearly in- appropriate that this expenditure should continue on its present basis and be classed as wartime expenditure, its allocation being left for decision at some later date. „ if proposed therefore to write to the roreign Office on the lines of the draft below, asking for their concurrence ,n &lt;. M.O. 4/t , All the Middle East Sub-Committee did in 19o9 wasto agree that £4,000 should be daced at the disposal of the Political Resident for special intelligence and payments, if necessary, to the Sheikhs with a view to influencing them in our favour if war should break out. Since then, the Government of India have continued the payment of Rs.50,000 a year on their own responsibility and without obtaining H.M.G. 's sanction. The proposal to which they now seek h.d.G. s agreement is, as I see it, in effect to increase, the secret service allocation of the Bushire budget by Rs.40,000 a year (there is evidently already some allocation for secret service included, though how much I do not know). 40,000 wil1 shared between H.M.G. and the Government of India in accordance with the normal /N © § 3. normal arrangement for the financing of the Residency. We have only the Political Resident's word for it that this increase is essential, but I suppose we may support it. Do you agree to the draft? v ^truvt f voULt Or. (S r * j.

As you will see, the Political Resident has put forward this proposal on the grounds that pre-v/ar intelligence v/as in adequately financed, and the sum in question is in fact a reduction of Rs. 10,000 from the war-time level. We should accordingly be glad to know whether you agree to the proposal.
