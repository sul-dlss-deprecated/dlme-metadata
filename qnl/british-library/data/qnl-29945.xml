Assuming that consideration of the Sultan's proposals for revision of the 1891 treaty will have proceeded sufficiently far, his presence and entertainment in this country might give a good opportunity, if this is agreeable to the Sultan, for making further progress with the question by at any rate informal discussions with him. Atmosphere might be favourable for this and it might moreover save time in view of the delays inevitably involved in dealing by telegraph with aspects of the negotiations in which other Departments of His Majesty’s Government are concerned. For the purpose of such discussions or conversations, however, it would of course be desiiable that we should have available here a political o^iicer competent to conduct them, who might be either the oxi-icer attached to the Sultan for his visit or an oiiicer deputed for the purpose of such treaty discussions. issue of the above has been duly authorised.

On the other hand we note that Powle thinks the whole transaction has done good, and that having said his say on paper, the Sultan will behave discreetly in practice# ie hope this will prove to be the case, but we feel that we shall have to watch our step in future communications to the Sultan if we are to maintain without open wrangling the position of practical ascendancy in his affairs which we have managed to eat blish by custom. e agree, therefore, that it is advisable to proceed cautiously ead that it will be better for the time being not to pursue the question of our alleged right to consultatlon# 6# In this connexion I enclose a copy of a memorandum by i^eokett on the subject of our relations with Muscat, which I think you W-ll agree forma a very useful audition to haithwaite f s admirable mfcmornnuuja of the &lt;aid Kovember, 1934, (India Office Confidential rint B,438. P.2.6811/34 )# and which showe that our treaty rights in regard to Muscat are, in fact, extremely tenuous# Years etc# Ogd.Laoy iaggalifty.( . 65«;B/10^3/91 . ^! I Relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Sultan of Muscat* The declareti on of 1962 under which both we and the French engaged ourselves reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat applied also the Sultan of Zanzibar* By the . nglo-French Declarations of the 6th August, 1890, this declaration waa abrogated as regards Zanzibar, and the Sultan of Sanzibar now enjoys no independence whatever in the international sense of the word, but is the ruler of a British protected State. The abrogation of the declaration as regards Sanzibar leaves it still in force however as regards Muscat and it seems to have been relied upon by both the French and ourselves subsequently to 1890* 2, The essence of the declaration of 1862 is the Independence of the Sultan of Muscat. Now one of the rights of an independent State is the right of alienating a portion of its territories if it wishes, unless it has entered into an engagement to the contrary. Under the 1 xclusive agreement of 1891 the Sultan of Muscat bound himself towards the Vilted Kingdom not to cede, sell, etc. save to the Br iti sh Oovrrnment any portion of his dominions. I think it is perfectly consistent with the agreement of 1862 for us to obtain an undertakin from the wultan of muscat that he would never cede any part of his dominions to any other Power. The only questionable part of this Exclusive agreement lay in the words 'save to the British Gowrnraent**, words which it was very foolish to have inserted, since the effect of the agreement of 1891 was exactly the same without these words in (since the Buitan could not cede territory to the British Government without the British Government’s consent and if they consented there waa no breach of the agreement of 1891 ) and the existence of these words ——*gave the French the only handle they could have had for pretending that the agreement of 1891 conflicted with the declaration of 1862. When In 1899 the Sultan had leased a coaling station In his ter Itorles to the French we quite rightly objected to the Sultan that this was contrary to the agreement of 1891 and made him cancel It on this ground# In their objections to tne French His Majesty’s Government relied: (1) On the agreement of 1891 (2) On the declaration of 1862. In reply to this the French Government could quite rightly contend that the Kxclusive igreeaent of 1891 was res Int er alloi acta so far as they were concerned, but I am less certain that His Majesty’s Govert merit could say that the lease was contrary to the declaration of 1862. Indeed, t s a matter of legal construction, I doubt if His Majesty’s Government’s contention was right that the lease was a breach of the declaration of 1882. That does not matter now, however, because in the end His Mojeaty’s Government’s interpretation of the aeclaration of 1»62 that it precluded either the French or ourselves from acquiring any territory from the Sultan of Muscat was accepted by both aides and must I think govern the future interpretation of the declaration. I should hesitate to accept as legally correct the view the Law Officers in paragraph 2 of their opinion of 1899 that the British Government would be Justified in punishing and even deposin g a particular Multan who broke hie engagements to the British Government and that such action would be consistent with the declaration of 186a. I can conceive no greater interference with the independence of a State than the forcible deposition of its ruler and his replacement by another. Leasing a little bit of territory is a very small jitter compered with this. My only purpose in making this observation is to point out that the Law iff leers view oi 1899 is not one which we could probablyeetablieh In an international dispute conducted on letjal lines* we should never ourselves accept ouch an interpretation of the 1862 declaration if the French Government thought of deposing a sultan* 4. It would appear from the above that there is no treaty which His Majesty^ Goveriiment can appeal to as obliging the Sultan of Muscat to consult or e/an inform His Majesty’s Government as regards his dealings with foreign lowers unless he was contemplating alienating a bit of his territory in which case the declaration of 1891 could be appealed to* Further, as a matter of strict law, it is in fact contrary to the declaration of 1862 for His Mftjesty f s Government to insist that he should do* To com,el him to do so is exercising our influence in a manner which (I think) is Inconolatent with independence* I do not suggest, however, that it is necessary for us at the present time to construe and apply the declaration of 1862 very strictly* In fact the biggest lever we have over the Sultan would appear to be the Zanzibar subsidy which I believe he receives annually through the lolltical Agent and I suppose, if and when we wish to do so and if we think it effective, we can use the possibility of the termination of this subsidy as a lever for exercising our influence inter alia in connexion #ith insisting on being consulted on the Sultan’s relations with a foreign lower* I gather the French know of the subsidy &amp;Aid do not object to it; otherwise it would be maintainable that the subsidising of a ruler was at least as prejudicial to his independence as obtaining the lease of a little bit of his territory.

Oman in ite geographical sense represents the South eastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula from Aou Hhaoi in the ftorth to the borders of Hadhramaut. Politically speaking, the Sultanate consists of the littoral extending from naa ^usandam at the entrance of the Persian Oulf along the hast and South coasts to nas i* art ax in v/entrai South Arabia, a coast iine ol 1,100 miles, together with the overseas possession of uwadar, ar important kekran port which andles t e trade of ;nuch of Codtnern Hritish Baluchistan and Soutn Hastern Persia, and is situated on the Imperial Air noute to Inaiu. iSan^ibar, once attached to the Sultanate of Oman, but now a nritish Protectorate, still pays a nominal tribute to the Muscat Treasury, and the Zanzibar nuling Family is a collatei al branch of the Al Sa 1 ia dynastic family of Oman, whose head is the Sultan. ajLSTOyLwXB. This maritime Arab State is believed by some to have been the ori inal home of the Phoenicians: its sailors f carried the trade between Babylonia and India, and its seas wer« the cradle of navigation* Oman fi uree oefore the rioe of Islui aa an appanage of Persia, and in turn fell into the hands of the Abbaaide Caliphs of naghdad, but from the kiddle A ,es onwards secured inaependence unaer its own native rulers* ihe pi'esent dynasty rose in 1741. Napoleon, to further his Indian designs, re arced the Sultanate as of such importance ao to seek an alliance, cut the period of greatest prosperity came fift^ yean later under the Sultan Saiyid ba*id } the grenu c,raxi.dl at her of the present Sultan, who was perhaps one of the greatest Arab figures to appear since the Arab rophet. He extended his inf.i.uence northwards, absorbing Bahrain and nushirc and asserting/asserting his mastery of the entire Persian uulf, finally reachingl Basrah, where he conducted a naval expedition. Be invaded and colonised Zanzibar and the adjacent Bast African territory. He presented a frigate to our Boyai Navy and received another, the •Prince Regent* in return. The Sultanate has since then diiainishedjj gradually in importance. Internal disaffection and rebellion have restricted the authority of the Sultan to the coastal districts. British policy has throughout this later period been chiefly concerned with suppressing (a} the Slave i'rade and (b) the Arms Traffic. Both had their centre in muscat, which derived from them great wealth. Muscat was the slave market for i&gt;oath East Arabia and the Armoury for European arms destined to oe smuggled jj across the Persian Gulf for Afghanistan, Baluchistan and the North tfest Frontier. Both have disappeared largely through the activities of the Royal Navy and the collaboration oi the bultan under Treaty obligations. PHYSICAL F-AfJhES . The dominant physical features of Oman are (1; a lofty ran 0 e of mountains running almost parallel with the coast, the great backbone of the country risin 0 to a height of 10,000 feet in Jebel Akdhar, (II; a coastal plain distinguished for a date grove one hundred and fifty miles long and from three to seven miles in depth, (HI) beyond the mountains, the immense jj unpenetrated spaces of Kuba al Khali, which have hitherto baffled explorers. The deep waters off the Oman coasts render navigation simple, and muscat is a safe harbour as well as oeing a veo beautiful one. OnlMATE . Encircled by precipitous volcanic cliifs, Hs summer climate is intensely hot and there is scarcely any difference between day and night temperature. It was of Muscat that the Persian poet wrote ’And here, the panting sinner receives a foretaste of his future destiny’. Ihe average rainfall varies between three ana six inches. POPULATION/PQPPLAl'IOE . The total population of Oman has been estimated at 500,000, representing perhaps 15^ of the entire population 01 the Arabian peninsula: 80,- of these are tribal Arabs, there is a considerable pure negro element generally in domestic service, and a less numerous foreign trading element which consists of aritlsh Indians, Persians and Baluchis. There is, however, a large admixture of African blood in the population at large, as also in the lulling Family. PnOiiaCTS Aftli TnAflK . The overseas trade is largely with Bombay, Aden and Zanzibar, though America takes a considerable portion of Oman’s date crop for tter own black population, ihe ushenes, chiefly shark for export to the Far Bast, are of second importance to the date industry. The camels of Oman are famous throughout Araoia, but the country is too thirsty to allow the horse to flourish and very few are bred. Indigo dyeing, copper and brass work and cloth weaving are among other industries, ana there is a crude but characteristic variety of gold and silver work, especially used for sheaths and mountings of daggers ana sworas. itgmluIOK . The State religion is the Ibadhi sect of Islam, ..hich l3 elsewhere found in Morocco. Fiercely intolerant of other creeds, Oman has been traditionally hostile to foreign penetration, and the Sultan himself, disapproved of for his infidel associations, has himself never deemed it expedient to visit the interior mountains. The tenets of loadhiem, in their puritanical narrowness, resemble the Wahabism of Central Arabia. The Government of the Sultanate is patriarchal or feudal, and judged by western oureauoratic standards is without much system or efficiency, but it admirably suits the conditions and needs of the inhabitants. At one time a theocracy, the religious functions have been dropped by later Sultans m -avoui of an elected— 1 ( bj His Highness The Sultan Saiyid Tainiur bin Faisal bin 2urki, K.C.I.E., C.S,I. The Sultan succeeded his father in 1913 when he was 27 years old, so that his age is now 42 and he has oeen ruling for | 15 ^ ears. In appearance he is bulky, of middle hei ght axid distinguished looking. Slow of speech, he is re ,arded by fciuropaine as possessing krao charoi and dignity, ks a young man he passed through a phase of Religious bigotry 1 . *ut he has long since outgrown it. A sign of this is his fondness for smoking which practice is anathema to the strict Ibaahi. is, however, remained a good Muslim in that he is a teetotaler. He is popular with his subjects; is not politically minded outside the boundaries of his own State; is proud of and loyal to his nritish alliance and was awarded the K.C.I.E. in 1926. He has three sons, the eldest of whom Saiyid Sa’ia, is being educated at an Arab School in Baghdad. The Sultan has suffered in health for many years and will undergo an operation for appendicitis in England, mis long absences from Muscat on this account led him some years ago to wish to aodicate in favour of his eldest son - a course he was dissuaded from taking by our counsels. He has paid many visits to India where, at Hehra Hun, he possesses a bungalow, uub spends most of his time at Ihofar in South Arabia (whither he is given passage in one of H.M. ships) - to his Crown Estates. There he has a residence and some shootin,... His chie-u interest is ’shikar' of the kind that the desert provides, gazelle, anterope, and an occasionar panther, muii he a lover oi sport and open air life _,eneraliy and in spite of his health, rast year under ioik a 300 mile camel journey northwards from Muscat through his country. He has made a fine collection oi Arab cooks, out his scholarship is limited and he knows liitxe of any language but his own. As an Arab chief he is of necessity a poor man as compared with certain of the Indian Ruling irinoss, his annual State revenues scarcely amounting to M10Q,0Q0, but the his toxic importance/i Jo/Jiq importance attaching to his office is aujgeated by his salute 21 guns. The Sultanate is not a British Protectorate. In law it has sovereign status. Besides its Treaty relations with it has ireaty relations with Prance and America. -afore the dreat War these Powers had Consuls stationed at luscat, ana France stil- cominunicates airectiy with the Sultan, as does the League oi Nations. In practice, however, nritiah influence in the State is paramount.No. C/3.1 of 1938 The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to *NI&gt; POLITICAL — CONFIDE?*” 7 *-: - L RECORD Onre. ^ f^nr N’o. ^ 2- h, . 3 . •' yai „• a Ttie Political Agent, tfiscat. nd is direeteld ^iranfemit to him a copy of the undermentioned docnmentf.

GIBSOftV- f D«ar Bouald, Many thank® for your letter of the 3rd Beoetaber about the iaipen&lt;Un&amp; visit of the Sultan of Muscat to the United Statea* At first eight your sug{;eetione seem entirely suitable, but we feel we ought to consult the India Office before going any further, so this ie only a provisional reply. We hope to get their views very shortly, and I will write to you again as soon as possible. As regarde the question of the precise status of the Jultan of Muscat, you may perhaps liko to have the attached copies of two memoranda which have been written here, the first a memorandum of the 16th November by Beckett, and the other a paper written on the 24th JKovember by Bagt-allay of my department, raising a point which is still under disouesion. I realise that you are not likely to have much spare time for this kind of light literature, on so trivial a side issue, but, as it is possible that this question of the status of the Sultan may arise in some unexpected form during his visit to the United states, I think it may be useful for you to have these papers available, in case they should be required. I will let you hear again about the various practical points you raise as soon as possible. Aith all good wishes for the Bew Tear. Yours ever, (Sgd.) a.

Dear George, The tato Dep rtacmt tells me that the Sultan ojl M uooat arrivos at San Francisco on February 10th. They are sending iuosaerlin, the rather bibulous Head oX the rrotocoi, to iaeot him there, but Summerlin leavea him at Zan f raaciooo, and theiU)eXorward the sultan will be in charge of a State Department Agent, who can be trusted to act as a very competent courier and miser of orranpemonia. The State Departfiient oont him a hint that he chouldwear Arab costume, this in order to minlmiee the poesibilitiee of unpleasantneaa arieiiig out of the colour Question. The Sultan hae said that he will wear his robes on formal occasions, and plain clothes on others. He apparently mane to visit Hollywood and to travel by the Southern route, which is perhaps rather a pity for colour reasons, and he will arrive at ! ashington on the 10th of March where he will be the guest of the United Stet es Government for two or three days; and he apparently sails in the ' lueen iAory*' which I see leaves on the S3rd of March. X understand that the President will probably give him a luncheon, and the State Department rather wants me to throw a party for him. I should propose also to give him a luncheon, which ie pretty plain a ailing. The Department is much edited at having found a lady in f ashlngton who is the direct descendant of Edmund G. a.

P.Z.7b07/37 My dear Bag^allay, We sent to the Foreign Office on 24th November (India Office letter No.P.Z.7b07/37) a copy of a demi- official letter from Caroe, aated the 2bth October, in which, with reference to the mention of Muscat in Rendel f s report of nis conversation with Signor Crolla on the 12th July, he remarked that the Sultan now proposes to visit Rome and will no douut receive a certain amount of attention there* We cannot, I suppose, exclude the possibility that the attraction of a fresh venture in Arabia might indeed tempt the Italians to woo the Sultan T s lavour in the hope of getting some advantage. Our position with regard to the Sultan*s relations with foreign powers is at present more tnan usually delicate - see your letter of the 25th November (E.bo25/1023/91) - and we nave little hope of influencing them at any rate during his tour. But we suggest tnat it might be interesting and helpful if His Majesty*s Representatives in the countries visited by the Sultan, and particularly in Italy, could be asked to report any information reaching them of political interest legal ciing the Sultan*s contacts with foreign Governments, and especially any indications that advances were being made by them to him - or vice versa. If you agree, we suggest that in tne case of Tokyo it might be desirable to send the necessary instructions by telegraph, since the Sultan* s stay in Japan is likely to run from 21st December to the end of January.

Sir, v^ith reference to your despatch No«556 (E*6474/1023/91) of 15th November last I have the honour to report that His Highness, saiyid .said bin Taixaur, Sultan of }^iscat and Oman, left Yokohama on the 27th January for San Francisco by the steamship 'Tatsuta M&amp;ru”, thus concluding hia stay of five weeks in this country, 2, His iii{jhnees arrived at Kobe on December the 2;5rd by the stear^hip n Hakone Maru w from Hongkong and stayed at an hotel there. He was accompanied by his brother, Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur, by two secretaries, Helal bin Bader and saiyid Abdulounim Zawawi, by an official Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shnbaily, and by two negro servants. The cm in purpose of his visit was to •ae his father saiyid Taimur, who, having abdicated in 1932, has for the last two years been living in Kobe with a Japanese wife. The announcement of the Sultan v s arrival appeared in the « Japanese, although not in the foreign press, and throue^iout his stay in Kobe His Highness was constantly troubled by Japanese roportere although he refused to grant any interviews. The Right Honourable Anthony l*deR,&amp;e, ,M1,, ® i/C *, etc•, etc•,3. I instructed Hie Majesty 1 e Consul at Kobe to call on His Hi ;hness and to inform him that I desired to alee an early opportunity of welcoming him to Tokyo and that I hoped to arrange a dinner in his honour# I also asked Br#Ovena to make discreet enquiries as to whether Hie Highness would like to stay at the limbaasy when he came to Tokyo. 4. Can the 31st December Mr.Orene called by appointment on the Sultan who received him most courteously and appeared to be gratified by the solicitude shown on his behalf# He looked forward to visiting the iSmbassy but hoped that any entertainment which was arranged in his honour would be of a 'private” nature, since he was anxious to maintain the strictest incognito while in Japan. As regards staying at the Embassy, he had already decided to stay at an hotel in Tokyo in view of hie desire for as much freedom of movement and as much privacy as possible. Mr.Ovens reported that the Sultan bad been very harassed by newspapermen and that t.;e ira rossion which he and his suite had formed of this country up then had not been an entirely happy one. 5. After a short visit to Kyoto the Sultan and his party arrived in Tokyo on the 10th January where they wore met at the station by a member of my staff, who conveyed my greetings to His Highness. Fears for the preservation of the Sultan's incognito, however - to a very large extent these determined all the party's movements - led to a sudden change in tneir plans and after only one night in Tokyo they left hurriedly for an hotel in Yokohama where tney stayed until they loft Japan and where they successfully concealed their identity, at least from the press. 6. The Sultan eventually accepted my invitation and came to luncheon at the Embassy on the 16th January, t.;s guests consisting solely of members of my staff and their wives.7. am he had ox^reasad a dtalr* t© attend a aeeaioa et the Diet which me then a it tin., two *c©ab#ra of the ataff aooomianiad Eia ;iijhnaa« f together with . j*2awaai and !^r # fiaAar # ie a aesalon of the timer Hauae on the ‘.Ath January* ©• On tm tQllQiinG day, the 2fith Jaiiaary, 1UU hlghmee lunched at the American Embaaay, ray United States scileogue haring ’men ooncernad in sashing arranueiaente for hia journey aoroaa the United states to ifeaahington where ho will he the guest of the i reaidant* 9* On January £7th the Sultan and hia auita loft for San TTanniaeo by the ataa&amp;ship *$at«uta Maru 1 ** Hi® tnxher was in the ^arty hut it ia expected that he will at&gt;on ratarn to l^oha* 1C* fta* is^reasions which the Sultan and hia fonaad of Ja^an were far fro® favourable.

No effort has been spared to make every moment of my visit interesting and enjoyable, and I shall always preserve the happiest recollections of a country with which I and my people are linked in true friendship.' 1 6. Partly owing to the elaborate programme of entertainment which was arranged for the Sultan during his visit to America the official programme of entertainment in this country was somewhat more elaborate than is usual in the case of visits of this nature, and special efforts were made by Major Crankshaw to ensure the success of the arrangements made. There is not the slightest doubt that the Sultan enjoyed himself immensely and that the visit was an unqualified success. At all times the Sultan expressed himself as interested in what he was shown and appreciative of what was done for him. As in the case of similar items in the programme of his official visit to Delhi last November, the two events most appreciated by the Sultan were the trips by air over London and the visit to the Agricultural College at Cambridge. If anything the programme was too full and on any future similar occasion it might be a good thing to leave a little more time for leisure and private affairs. It ia true that on this occasion certain mornings and afternoons v/ere left free for the purpose of official discussions with the Sultan. His Highness, so far from resenting tiis encroachment on the short period of his visit which was not filled with official entertainments, welcomed the opportunity for talks on official matters and was most anxious to complete the Treaty discussions, so far as possible, during Sir T. Fowle T s presence in London. The Sultan did not seem particularly interested in things/things mechanical; hut he liked scenery, trees, flowers etc, and on the occasion of a^y future visit it might he a good thing to show him more of the country. During the period of official entertainment His Highness refused all ’’private' invitations except that of Lord Cadman. The proposed visits to Broadcasting House and to the de Havilland Aircraft Factory were cancelled at the Sultan’s request. His Highness declined the invitation to ma v e a short broadcast in Arabic hut did not give his reasons for doing so. The visits to the Tower of London and to Windsor Castle were arranged at the Sultan’s request. The informal dinner on the 7th April- at which Sir Lancelot Oliphant acted as host was arranged in order to give the Sultan an opportunity of meeting representatives of certain foreign missions i.e. Saudi- Arabian; Iraqi; Egyptian and French. ?. A copy of the speech delivered by the Sultan at the Government dinner on 2i th March is attached. 6. A list of guests who accepted invitations to attend the Reception held by the Sultan at Dorchester Hotel on 8th April is also attached. 9. The Sultan was greatly interested in the news films of himself taken during his visit. Copies of the films (specially reduced to fit his cine-camera) were purchased by the Government Hospitality Fund and presented to His Highnes 10. The Sultan was granted an interview by Lord Halifax, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on 11th April. 11. Rai Sahib Dulichand, the Sultan’s Accountant-General, arrived in England at the end of March and remained throughout/throughout the visit. He stayed at a different Hotel and at the Sultan's request he was not included in the official party. 12. The Sultan left England for France at the end of trie official visit on the evening of 12th April and at his request his departure was kept as quiet as possible. So anxious was His Highness to prevent his identity from being discovered in Prance that the whole party travelled under assumed names. He was seen off by oir Trenchard Fowle, Major Crankshaw and a representative of the India Office. 13. The Sultan returned to England by air, (in a purely private capacity) on 19th April and, usin e the name of Mr.Ozdi, occupied a suite of rooms at Queen Anne's Mansions. He was accompanied by Mr. Hullchand and one servant only, the remainder of his suite remaining in Paris. It is understood that His Highness preferred the privacy of Queen Anne’s Mansions; and on the occasion of any similar official visit in the future it might be better to engage accommodation at that place in preference to an flotel. His Highness ended his private visit on 1st May and was seen off at Croydon Air port by Major Crankshaw and a representative of the India Office. During this private visit most of the day-time was occupied in official talks connected with the revision of the Muscat Treaty etc., and with shopping excursions. His Highness accepted invitations to take tea with Lady Willingdon and Lady Linlithgow but otherwise refused to accept any 'private” invitations of importance. During this period the Sultan gave the impression that he was really enjoying the novelty of being separated from his suite - he stated that this was the first time he had been alone since he was 14 years old - and it is thought that he would have liked to remain for a longer period; but as he had made arrangements to return to Muscat in July this was not possible.UNOFFICIAL.

He has a pleasant personality, and though short in stature (about 5 ’ C”), bears himself* with considerable dignity end is endowed uitn a quiet sense of* humour.

GENERAL ^ The Sultanate is not a British Protectorate. In law it has independent sovereign status. Besides its Treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government it nas treaty relations with France and America, and before the Great War these Powers had Consuls stationed at Muscat. TERRITORY Oman in its geographical sense represents the South Eastern corner of the Arabian reninsula from Abu Dhabi in the North to the borders of the Aden Protectorate. Politically speaking, the Sultanate consists of the littoral extending ^ from Rac Musandam at the entrance of the Persian Gulf along the East and South coasts to Has Fartak in Central South Arabia, a coast line of 1,100 miles, together with the overseas possession of Gwadur, an important Mekran port which handles the trade of much of Southern British Baluchistan and South Eastern Persia, and is situated on the Imperial Air Route to India. HISTORICAL This maritime Arab State is believed oy some to have been the original home of the Phoenicians. Its sailors carried/carried the trade between Babylonia and India, and its seas were the cradle of navigation. Oman figures before the rise of Islam as an appanage of Persia, and in turn fell into the hands of the Abbasid Caliphs of Baghdad, but from the Middle Ages onwards secured independence under its own native rulers. The present dynasty rose in 1741. Napoleon, to further his Indian designs, regarded the Sultanate as of such importance as to seek an alliance, but the period of greatest prosperity came seventy years iater under the Sultan Saiyid Sa'id, the great great grandfather of the . present Sultan. He ruled from 1807 to 1856 and was perhaps one of the greatest Arab figures to appear since the Arab prophet. He extended his influence northwards and asserted his mastery over the entire Persian Gulf. He invaded and colonised Zanzibar and the adjacent East African territory. He presented a frigate to our Royal Navy and received a handsome yacht, the 'Prince Regent', in return. The Sultanate has since then diminished gradually in importance, largely as a result of the influence on Muscat trade of the development of steam navigation and the opening of the Suez Canal. PHYSICAL FEATURES The dominant physical features of Oman are (i) a range of mountains running almost parallel with the coast, the great backbone of the country rising to a height of 10,00e feet in Jebel Akdhar, (ii) a coastal plain distinguished for a date grove one hundred and fifty miles long and from three to seven miles in depth, (iii) beyond the mountains, the immense spaces of Ruba al Khali, the Great Desert. The deep waters off the Oman coasts render navigation simple, and Muscat is a safe as well as a very beautiful harbour. CLIMATE Encircled by precipitous volcanic cliffs, the oummex climate/climate of Muscat is intcnssly hot and there is scarcely difference between day and night temperature. It was of Muscat that the Persian poet wrote ’’And here the panting sinner receives a foretaste of his future destiny 1 ’. The average rainfall varies between three and six inches. POPULATION AND RE LX MI PIT The total population of Oman has been estimated at 500,000 representing perhaps 15 per cent, of the entire population of the Arabian peninsula. 80 per cent, of those are tribal Arabs, there is a considerable pure negro element generally in domestic service, and a less numerous foreign trading element which consists of British Indians, Persians and Baluchis. The majority of the inhabitants belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam, which is elsewhere found in Morocco. PRODUCTS AND TRALB The Overseas trade is largely with Bombay, Aden and Zanzibar, though America takes a considerable portion ox Oman s date crop. The fisheries, chiefly shark for export to the Par East, are of second importance to the date industry. The camejm of Oman are famous throughout Arabia, but the country is ooo parched to allow the horse to flourish and very few are bred. Indigo dyeing, copper and brass work and cloth weaving are among other industries, and there is a crude but characteristic variety of gold and silver work, especially used for sheaths and mountings of daggers and swords.Speech delivered by His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and 'Oman at the Government Dinner, on the 29th March, 1938. Lord Zetland, my Lords and Gentlemen’, I should like to thank Your Lordship for the kind words in v/hich you have proposed my health, and you, Gentlemen, for i honouring the Toast in this way. And I should like to say how much I appreciate the welcome that I have received. As you know, the Sultans of Muscat and ’Oman have been in treaty relations with the British Government for more than a century, and I welcome this opportunity of visiting Great Britain. I hope tomorrow to have the great pleasure of seeing His Majesty King George and to enter into a personal friendship which I trust will endure. As I said, the Governments of Great Britain and ’Oman have been long in treaty relations, but I would claim more than treaby relations, relations of true friendship and real understanding. Your Lordship has referred to certain help which I have been able to give and I should like to assure you that I am v.ery glad to have been of assistance to H.M’s Government. And I on my side am deeply appreciative of the help and assistance extended by His Majesty's Government from time to time to the Sultans of Muscat and ’Oman which the Saudi dynasty will not forget. I hope that these happy relations will be further strengthened by the personal friendship v/hich I now have the privilege of forming with you all. I have greatly enjoyed my journey and am sure that I shall enjoy my stay in this country. I do not think that you v/ill wish for a long speech and I will close with renewed thanks and wish you all good health and happiness./ v List of acceptances for Sultan’s Reception. 8 . 4 .38• Badr» Halal bin Baggallay, Mr. H.L.

T v?y Lord, With reference to Your Lordsalp’a despatch No. 900 (E 2867/193/91) of ’ay 5th, and previous correspondence regarding the visit to France of His Highness Satyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman, I have the nonour to report that the Sultan, who, as you are aware, left the » United Kingdom for France on May let, called upon the President ol the Republic on Me,/ 12th and is understood to have left this country shortly afterwards. 2. t regret that I am unable to furnish Your ordship with information (in accordance with the instructions contained in your despatch No. 736 (E 1932/196/91) of April 11th) regarding any political or commercial advances which ia nave been made to His Highness by the French Government durin his visit to France. 3. It is conceivable, however, that no such advances were in fact made, for during the whole of his visit, with tne e-Kception of his call on ;. Lebrun on the day before his departure, the .ultan preserved the strictest incognito; and he appeared to shun any official contact with the inistry of Foreign Affaire. Indeed, as late as May 5th, the Ministry were still without news of hie arrival in France, a fact which caused them some anxiety, as the visit had originally been announced by the French Ambassador in London as being due to begin as early as April 18th. 4. . Corbin had also reported that the Uultan’s representative/ .The Right Honourable The Visoount Halifax, K.G. , G.C.H. I. , G.C.I.E. , etc., etc., etc.&gt; v * *repreeentative had informed the French Embassy in London that His Highness was exhausted by the receptions and banquets offered in his honour in the United Kingdom and by the numerous visits which he had made to museums in that country } and that he therefore intended to devote his time in aria to pleasures of a ore private nature. In the event, the only activity of the ultan of which the I inistry of Foreign Affairs would appear to have any knowledge, apart from His Highness^ call at the Elysee, was a visit wnich he paid to Fontainebleau in a motor-car placed at his disposal by the Ministry. 6. The aria i ress of ay 13th chronicled the Sultan’s visit to M. Lebrun, and on the same day the 'Petit Parisien” contained a short paragraph recording the cordial relations obtaining between France and the Sultanate since the signature of the Convention of Co'trnerce and Friendship in 16^4, Apart from this, however no interest at all appears to have been taken by the Press in the Sultan’s visit to this country.

Regret p&gt;fis*ge not yet arranged will telegraph when booked.I - Gray Mackenzie offered the Sultan through their agent at Muscat six first class berths and two seconds which was the nearest they could provide to the actual accommodation required on the Barela. Your telegram C/27 of the 5th January was sent in a code which I do not hold. As it was marked important I telephoned to Daubeny at Khorramshahr and passed him the groups to decode which he very kindly did, telephoning back a paraphrase. He asked me to let you know that this completely ruined his Sunday tiffin.*: On receipt of your subsequent telegram No C/37 I requisitioned two first class berths and two seconds in the Bandra and telegraphed you accord ingly. I am of course always very ready to assist in booking passages for the Sultan and his family and fully realise that they are persons of importance and that their requirements as regards passages must be met as far as possible. Nevertheless it comes very hard on other passengers, who often have had to wait six weeks or two months to get a berth, to be turned off at the last moment in order that their berths should be made available for the short journey from Muscat to Karachi and should remain empty for the rest of the voyage. Many of these are people who have been compelled to leave the Balkans and have only been able to obtain just sufficient Foreign Exchange to cover their passages and subsistence on the journey. / If n T. Hickinbotham, Political Agency, MuscatIf therefore thay are delayed en route there is a grave risk of their running out of funds and having to he assisted financially by the Govern ment. I may not therefore always be able to arrange for you to have all the accommodation you may require. I would be grateful if, in any case, you would always II give me as much notice as possible and would endeavour ^ to indicate the urgency of the circumstances and the minimum number of berths which you consider it is * essential should be provided on each occasion supposing I cannot let you have the full number asked for. Would you also consider bringing such part of the foregoing to the attention of the Sultan as you may consider desirable.

Muscat, the 22nd January,1341, 5* Please refer to your demi-official letter No. 75, dated the 11th January, 1941. 2 . I am very grateful to you for the trouble that you have taken and the assistance that you have always rendered to us in cases of this sort. The Sultan applied to the local Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company on the 29th November, 1940, for one 1st class return passage and two 2 nd class return passages for himself in the first steamer leaving here after the 1st of January, 1941, and for two 1 st class passages and one 2 nd class passage for his mother to Karachi by the steamer leaving here after the 1 Id v/hich occurred in the second week of January. The Shipping Company were very dilatory and it was not until the 13th of December that they announced by telegram from Basra that there was no accommodation available. I endeavoured to obtain accommodation by telegraphing to the Agents in Karachi but after further delay on their part they merely referred me to Basra. Eventually for some unknown reason Bahrain offered six first class and two second class passages in the first ship arriving after the 1st of January. I think you will agree that one 1 st class berth and two 2 nd class berths are not excessive even in war time for sin independent Ruler nor are two 1st clas c ; and one 2nd class excessive for his mother and her attendants. As regards giving notice as early as possible you will see that the Sultan gave fivecweeks 1 ; notice for the passages asked for himself and a ratter of six to seven weeks for the passages asked forchis mother. 3 . I much regret that you were sent a message in a code which is not held by you and I am sorry the even tenor of Daubney’s existence was slightly disturbed. If we can ever do anything for British refugees passing through I shall be most grateful if you will send me a telegram and we will do what we can to entertain them. (Major T.Hickinbotham, O.B.E.).
