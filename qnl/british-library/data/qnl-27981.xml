REPORTS ON Serial rsio. 9 MINOR OPERATIONS IN SOUTH PERSIA UNDER Brigadier-General Sir P. M. SYKES, k.c,i.e., c.M.a„ From May to July 1918 GENERAL STAFF INDIACONFIDENTIAL. {Dy. No. 66188) Despatch No. IX. No. 64-3-4?-1-A., dated Shiraz, the 27th July 1918. From—Brigadier-General Sir P. M. Sykes, K.C.T.E., C.M.G., Inspector General, South Persia Rifles, To—The Chief of the General Staff, Army Headquarters, Simla. I have the honour to forward the attached reports of the officers who commanded various columns and forces which have been engaged in operations against Labu Muhammadis, Chehar Hadis and other robber tribes of Northern Ears, and against the Saulat-ud-Dauleh, II Khani of the Qashqais, and Nasr-i-Divan Kalantar of Kazarun, in the neighbourhood of Shiraz during May, June and July 1918. I also attach &lt;c Notes on Ears ”, which are intended to serve as an introduction to the subject. 2. The scene of several of the actions fought within 10 miles of Shiraz, was west of the city and in the upper part of the valley, which is there about eight miles wide, and lies roughly within the triangle Bulvardi, Ahmadabad, Chinar Rahdar. The mountains bordering this western end of the Shiraz valley are steep, rugged and barren. There are some vine-yards, in places, on the lower slopes, the vines being 3 to feet high. These mountains rise about 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the Shiraz plain. The Kuh-i-Barfi range separates the Masjid-i-Bardi branch of the valley from the Chinar Rahdar branch. There is a marked difference in the characteristics of these two branch valleys. The Masjid-i-Bardi valley, with a large village of the same name, is a mass of large walled gardens and orchards, with a few scattered hamlets and better class houses, such as the Bagh-i-Nawab. The Chinar Bahdar valley is comparatively open with small, fortified villages at intervals of half a mile to a mile apart. This valley was covered with crops, which were reaped in June (barley) and the beginning of July (wheat). Between Shiraz City and Ahmadabad there is a chain of fortified mud villages, about a mile apart. Between this chain ,and the southern edge of the Masjid-i-Bardi gardens there is a a important avenue of manoeuvre, about 2,000 yards wide. The block of walled gardens and dense vine-yards around Bagh-i-Janat and Kushan played an important part in many of these actions. The enemy usually put skirmishers into these enclosures, who had good lines of retreat towards the Kuh-i-Barfi. Between the Indian troops perimeter, cantonment and the Bagh-i-Janat, there are two projecting strips of gardens, which cross the main Shiraz-Chinar Rahdar road. (A) The Bagh-i-Muhammadiyeh.* (B) The Bagh-i-Gulshan and Afifabad. Both of these belong to our ally the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who maintained a small garrison of 20 Arab tufangchis in the Bagh-i-Muhammadiyeh, whicn is fortified. These two important tactical points had always to be secured, to cover advances and subsequent retirements. Afifabad is a walled and turreted Sarai, which was held from June 7th to 20th by a garrison of 50 Rajputs. 3. On March 11th, 1918, a British note was presented to the Persian Government, demanding the official recognition of the South Persia Rifles among other conditions. * Close to Afifabad.2 The reply of the Persian Government was distinctly hostile in tone. Recognition of the South Persia Rifles was refused, and the South Persia Rifles were referred to as a menace and danger to the independence of Persia. The agitation against us redoubled, and there is every reason to believe that instructions were issued from Tehran to various tribal chiefs to destroy the South Persia Rifles and to drive the British out of Persia. 4. The Persian plan appears to have been as follows :— (i) Intrigues and plots to undermine the loyalty of the South Persia Rifles, especially in Pars among the personnel of the old Swedish gendarmerie S. P. R. to desert. British ranks at outposts to be murdered. S P. R. at larger centres, such as Shiraz and Abadeh,* to join the enemy as soon as the tribes men attacked. (ii) Saulat-ud-Dauleh with his Qashqais, and Nasr-i-Divan of Kazarun with his men, to move via Khaneh Zinian and attack Shiraz. The Qashqais of the Sarhad villages, to attack Abadeh* and Dehbid.* The Lashanis, Kuhistanis. Chah Haqis and Labu Muhammadi Arabs to attack Niriz* and Saidabad.* The Baharlus to close the road inland from Bandar * Abbas.* 5. In April 1918 the Kazarunis moved up and occupied the Changt and Dasht Arjan, ostensibly to protect caravans. In April 1918 a letter was intercepted from the revenue official at Niriz,* a noted democrat, to Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh, which mentioned the projected attacks by Chah Haqis and Labu Muhammadis. These two communities had made many raids recently. It was decided to attack and punish them and thereby forestall their attacks. This was done by a column which started from Niriz* on 8th May 1918 under Lieut.-Colonel G. P. Grant, D.S.O., who conducted a series of operations which were brilliantly successful; the Chehar Radis and the Mullah Qurbun of Sarchahan* w r ere also dealt with on the return journey to Shiraz. In April 1918, desertions in parties of about 12 to 18 occurred in the Abadeh*—Dehbid* S. P. R. units. Some deserters were pursued and captured. Some ringleaders were shot at Isfahan. Letters left behind for others of the South Persia Rifles shewed the political anti-British nature of these desertions. It is noteworthy that in April 1918 several senior Persian officers of the S. P. R. at Shiraz resigned, giving no adequate reasons. One company 16th Rajputs was sent to Abadeh’' in April 1918, from which one platoon was detached at Dehbid ;* to protect the munitions, stores and treasure at these two places. 6. Early in 1918, the scheme of Saulat-ud-Dauleh appears to have been to threaten Shiraz, hoping the British would be alarmed, and would buy him off with a large subsidy. His idea was that he would be placed in charge of the Bushire-Shiraz road, and get a subsidy of 80,000 tumans a month for his services. There is little doubt that certain high placed Persian officials were concerned in this early scheme, and had arranged shares in the spoil. By the beginning of May, however, Saulat-ud-Dauleh and Nasr-i-Divan appear to have received their instructions frum Tehran* to destroy the South Persia Rifles, to turn the British out of Southern Persia and to murder and loot British and Indian ranks. The promises of an easy victory at Shiraz and the loot of rifles, ammuni tion, treasure, stores and personal effects attracted considerable numbers to the camps of the Saulat and Nasr-i-Divan. * On map. f Not shewn.3 On loth May 1918, the Darashuri tribe of Qashqais was in camp near Khaneh Zinian. Some hundreds of Eazarunis were collected in the Dasht Arjan plain. The Kazarunis had boasted as far back as the beginning of April that they would shortly attack and loot Khaneh Zinian. There had been some intrigues among the S. P. R. garrison of Khaneh Zinian in April, and another company was sent there, in relief, towards the end of April. On 10th May, Soulat had moved up from his winter quarters near Firu- zabad ; to a camp about two marches south of Shiraz. There w r as nothing unusual in this, as it was the ordinary period of migration. The investigation into the treacherous surrender of Khaneh Zinian on 25th May shews that intrigues and communications between the Kazarunis and the S. P. R. men at Khaneh Zinian and at the outpost of Timouri had been going on at least as early as the beginning of May. The arrest on 10th May of three Darashuri robbers who tried to carry off two S. P. R. donkeys grazing near the fort was made the excuse of an attack by the Darashuris the same day. On 11th May a column of S. P. R troops marched to Khaneh Zinian. On 12th May the Darashuris were attacked and lost about 15 pien killed and wmunded The S. P. R. had one man wounded. On 13th May some Indian troops went to the support of the S. P. R., but the Darashuris had disappeared. The troops returned to Shiraz on 15th May. 7- Within ten days, 2,010 Kazarunis and Qashqais were besieging Khaneh Zinian. They had an organized line of communications for supplies, based on Kazarun. * Saulat with between 4,000 and 5,000 men w'as near Khaneh Khabis, a flank menace to our road towards Khaneh Zinian, with an organized line of communications for supplies and munitions based on Firuzabad. Simultaneously agitation began in Shiraz city, and the mullahs and democrats became more actively anti-British. Desertions began in small numbers in the S. P. R. all over Pars. A Baharlu contingent of over 300 joined the Saulat. Small contingents came up from Borazjun and Dashtistan. Saulat was proclaiming jihad, and declared he w r as acting under the instructions of the Persian Government. 8. The Burma Mounted Rifles and the section of artillery of Lieut.- Colonel Grant’s column reached Shiraz on 21st Mav. The wdng 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry reached Shiraz on 23rd May. The Burma Mounted Rifles were immediately organized into three squadrons, utilizing the newly arrived draft. The 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry wmre organized into four companies, by some transfers between the original wing and the newly arrived wing of recruits. A column 1,600 strong was organized, and the remainder, with their stores, were concentrated from outlying gardens into the previously arranged defensive perimeter. The column left Shiraz in the afternoon of 24th May. The action of Deh Shaikh was fought on 25th May in which Saulat’s 4,500 men w ere severely defeated after an action lasting about 14 hours. On 26th May the mounted troops and one section artillery advanced as far as the Shaikh villages, and the column returned to Deh Shaikh to proceed with the relief of Khaneh Zinian. Straggling mutineers were captured at Deh Shaikh, and it w as only too clear that the South Persia Rifles garrison of Khaneh Zinian, on the afternoon of 25th May, had treacherously shot Captain Will and Sergeant Coomber, and opened the gate to the Kazarunis. The column returned to Shiraz on 27th May. 9. The defences of the perimeter were improved, extra wells were dug, and every effort made to get in more supplies. The harvest was not yet in, and supplies were scarce. In addition, the attitude of local Persians was obstructive. Our friends were b«ing threatened and maltreated. b 24 The Qavvam was frightened and undecided. Personally he is very well disposed towards us, but many of his robber Kalantars had been punished by our columns, and the Arabs have hated the South Persia Rifles ever since the Swedish gendarmerie attacked and looted the Arabs in 1916. On the other hand the Qavvam and his Arabs have suffered much at the hands of Saulat and his Qashqais and as the weaker of the two main factions in Pars would be pleased to see the stronger faction (Saulat’s) suffer. 10. The Indian troops w r ere given as much training as possible. Musketry for recruits, training of Lewis gun teams and regimental and brigade tactical exercises. On 3rd June a convoy of spare hired transport started from Shiraz for Saidabad, to help in the laying out of supplies there, and the passage of rein forcements from Bandar Abbas. On 3rd June the South Persia Rifles detachment at Chinar Rahdar was withdrawn, because Saulat’s forces around Khaneh Khabis and Deh Shaikh had increased again, gradually, to about 5,000 men, with others not far off at Khaneh Zinian and Dasht Arjan. One company 16th Rajputs was placed at the Bagh-i-Janat, chiefly as the Consul and Parman Parma considered this to be highly important from a political point of view. On 5th June Colonel Orton and Lieutenant-Colonel Grant inspected the defences of Bagh-i-Janat and reported unfavourably. The company of Rajputs was withdrawn the same evening, as the enemy were threatening to enter Shiraz valley. 11. On 5th and 6th June the Consul was pressed to expedite two political measures which military headquarters regarded as most impor tant :— (i) to open up relations with Muhammad Ali Khan Qashquli, the bitter enemy of Saulat. (ii) to give encouragement to the Sardar Ehtesham, who was living in Shiraz with a view to his becoming II Khani in place of Saulat. Parman Parma was afraid of these political steps, and wished to put off doing anything, and the Consul agreed with Parman %“ Parma. 12. On 7th June a post of one Indian officer and 50 men of 16th Rajputs were put into the mud fort of Afifabad, about 2| miles from the perimeter, on the Chinar-Rahdar road. This was partly to comfort Parman Parma, and partly to secure a point d'appui for future operations in that direction. On this date a reconnaissance of two squadrons, S. P. R., and one squadron B. M. Rifles proceeded about five miles south of Shiraz. They captured and brought in a flock of 1,500 sheep, one Qashqai prisoner and three rifles. The sheep were undoubtedly of Qashqai origin, which were being sent over the Siakh pass for sale in Shiraz. The Persian authorities declared the city butchers had bought 1 and already paid for the sheep, so they were handed over next morning to the Deputy Governor. 13. On 9th June a convoy of 350 hired donkeys, under an escort of the Qavvam’s tufangchis, started from Shiraz for Saidabad.* Kazarunis (120) occupied Chinar Rahdar and the hills near by and a few were reported in the Bagh-i-Janat. 14. On Tuesday 11th June a brigade tactical exercise for Indian troops had been arranged. It was reported that a few hundred of the enemy were on the line Bagh-i- Janat-Kushan, and others in Masjid-i-Bardi. The column shelled the enemy and there was a little skirmishing. • Enemy losses 6 killed 14 wounded, Indian troops one wounded. 15. On 12th June Major McMurray, S. P. R. (108th Infantry) died of cholera at Shiraz. *# On map. 5 16. On 13th June the evidence so far recorded on the Khaneh Zinian tragedy pointed to previous knowledge, on the part of Sarhang Fath-ul- Mulk. This man belongs to the influential JNuri family of Shiraz. He had taken- a large part in the gendarmerie revolt of 1915-16. He had, however, arrested most of the Germans and kept them in the Arq and sub sequently handed them over to the British in November 1916. The S. P. B,. pay of this man had been continued, but he had been utilized politically and not in a military capacity. Earman Earma made him Deputy Governor of Niriz at the request of the Inspector General. Eath-ul-Mulk was arrested. Nothing definite could be proved against him. He is an intriguer. He was released a few days later, when his family and Earman Earma arranged for him to leave Shiraz for India. The enemy cut off the main irrigation water supply, and stopped nearly all the mills. This caused much suffering in the city, but we had good wells in the perimeter. 17. During the night 14th-15th June the Rajput post at Afifabad was heavily attacked. The Kazarunis were repulsed with rifle fire and bombs, the enemy losing about 12 killed 6 wounded. The Rajputs lost one killed and had two slightly wounded. IS. On 15th June some enemy were seen in the gardens 1,500 yards to 1,800 yards west of the perimeter. They retired after a few shells, losing * four killed six wounded. At midday 20 additional Rajputs were put into Afifabad post. 19. The enemy were now working up an agitation in Shiraz and threaten ing a big attack on 17th or 18th June. On 16th June the Indian column went out and fought the action of Ahmadabad, near Chinar Rahdar. The enemy’s losses were estimated at 200 killed 300 wounded. Our casualties were 5 killed 24 wounded. Subsequently when some of the Qashqais came over to our side, they stated that the total enemy losses on this day were between 600 and 700. 20. On 17th June there were anti-British and anti-South Persia Rifles’ demonstrations and processions in the town. No supplies could be got. The mullahs were preaching jihad. Earman Earma advocated the seizure and occupation of two or three commanding points in the town. The South Persia Rifles Persian ranks w r ere being maltreated and looted and were infuriated against the agitators. During the night 17th-18th June the town was occupied. On 18tb June some of the prominent agitators were arrested. The South Persia Rifles looted the houses of the two principal men who had ordered the South Persia Rifles to be looted. 21. Morning 19th June Ali Khan with 500 Qashqais captured Bajgah post, the 34 South Persia Rifles surrendering without any show of resistance. The telegraph line was cut up for seven or eight miles, and the new motor road was damaged. Ali Khan Salar Hishmat is a half brother of Saulat and a full brother of Sardar Ehtesham, our candidate as the new II Khani. Ali Khan had already made advances to Ehtesham to desert Saulat’s side. He said he would join Ehtesham as soon as Ehtesham were made II Khani. In the afternoon a motor car arrived from Niriz* with Major Hunter, I.M.S., and Sultan Muntassar-ul-Mulk, South Persia Rifles, the Persian aide- de-camp, of the Inspector General, South Persia Rifles. They were fortunate in getting through, as the Qashqais blocking the Niriz* road had only retired three hours before, consequent on our occupation of Shiraz City. 22. By 20th June the general situation was improving. The enemy was discouraged by the heavy casualties suffered, and was afraid to attack our perimeter or Shiraz City. The anti-British agitation had suddenly died down and Saulat and the Qashqais and the Kazarunis were being reviled freely for the sufferings they were causing to the city by cutting off the water supply6 r and by stopping tbe mills, and the Shirazi landowners were all having their harvest stacks and outlying gardens looted. Saulat caused several murders in outlying villages, of headmen and cultivators. It was very important to give the enemy no chance of a small local success Afifabad post was therefore evacuated and the Rajput garrison brought in to the perimeter, on 20th‘June. 23. On 21st June the Kazarunis occupied Afifabad. On 22nd June a, small Indian column advanced to Muhammadiyeh* and shelled the Kazarunis out of Afifabad and returned without incident. One or two shells were fired against enemy picquets on the Kuh-i-Baba hill, and the enemy sanger near Bulvardi village, from the South Persia Rifles’ 75 m.m. Schneider field gun, for which horses and a team of British non commissioned officers had been organized. The enemy losses were three killed and three wmunded. Supplies were now coming in again, especially barley and bhusa. The South Persia Rifles’ post at Zarghun surrendered to the enemy. About eight men came in to Shiraz across ttte hills. 24-, On June 25th information was received that 33 of the Qavvamabad South Persia Rifles’ garrison deserted on 19th June, and the remaining 15 surrendered to the Shaibani Arabs on 24th June. 25, On June 27th a dawn attack was made by two companies 124th Baluchis against the Kazarunis on the Bulvardi spur (2J miles North West of perimeter). Other troops were put out to cover the subsequent retirement. Enemy lost 12 killed 20 wmunded. Our casualties tw r o slightly wounded. 26. On June 29th the Baharlu chiefs and 300 men left Saulat and joined Qavvam in Shiraz. The Kazarunis and Qashqais began quarrelling. Parties of Kazarunis began to leave for home. June 30th bulk of the Rarashuris left Saulat and joined Muhammad Ali Khan Qashquli. The Consul gave a definite written assurance to Ehtesham on 30th June. ALi Khan joined Ehtesham with 500 Qashqais on 1st July. Earman Parma appointed Ali Khan II Begi. The Qavvam, Ehtesham, Ali Khan and Muhammad Ali Khan, formed an anti-Saulat confederacy. On 3rd July after much pressure, Parman Parma agreed to appoint Sardar Ehtesham II Khani in place of Saulat. The Sanad w 7 as read out on 4th July and officially issued on 5th July. 27- Saulat now’ had only about 1,000 men with him, and the Kazarunis had all gone back to their homes. The-new II Khani agreed to pursue Saulat if the Indian troops would drive him from his position betw r een Chinar Rahdar and Ak Cheshmeh. On the evening of 7th July the Indian column started. Some skirmish ing occurred in the dark near Chinar Rahdar. During the night the enemy attacked tbe perimeter camp. Early 8th July the enemy was attacked, defeated, and driven beyond Ak Chasmeh. Our new Persian allies arrived rather too late and only tackled stragglers. Saulat fled to Piruzabad. Ehtesham with new allies camped at Siakhf with 2,500 men, preparing to go on to Piruzabad. The Indian column returned to Shiraz evening 8th July. 28. During the night 8th-9th July new r s dated 2nd July was received by qctsid from AbadehJ that all South Persia Rifles there had joined Qashqai enemy on 28th-29th June; except 25 South Persia Rifles in the British perimeter. Captain Gywnne Griffith, R.E., died of wounds. Captain Winter wounded. Three Rajputs killed, three wounded. Twm cases of cholera in ^Closed to Afifabad. fPlace not shewn on any map, Range of Hills south and west of Shiraz. tOn map./ #On map. garrison. Muhammad Ali Khan Qashqai reported to ha^e died of cholera at Abadeh* about 1st July. South Persia Hides’ mutineers said to be disheartened and mostly going to their homes. 29. The situation at Shiraz having improved the following relief column left Shiraz for Abadeh* on 10th July :— Officer Commanding Column Staff Officer . Lieutenant-Colonel V. P. B. Williams. Major xA. X. I. Lilly* 2 squadrons B. M. Rifles. 1 section Mountain xArtillery. 300 3-124th Baluchistan In fantry. 80 S. P. R. Cavalry. 80 S. P R. Infantry. S P. R. Mule Corps and 7 carts. A trustworthy representative each of the Qavvam and of the new II Khani accompanied Lieutenant-Colonel Williams. 30. The telegraph to Dehbid re-opened on 11th July. The garrison there reported all well. Arab camps all round but Qavvam’s orders had stopped any attack. Dehbid’s* latest information was to the effect that fighting was still going on at Abadeh. 31. Lieutenant-Colonel V. P. B. Williams’ column had a few shots fired at it near Bajgah and again near Persepolis. 300 additional mules were hired at Sivand.* One sepoy 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry died of heat stroke near Saadatabad.* The column reached Dehbid* on 14th July, and Sarmaq* on 16th July. Surmaq* is 18 miles from Abadeh.* The besiegers were still attacking the garrison. William’s column did a night march, and reached positions around Abadeh* by 6 a.m , 17th July, but the besiegers had nearly all fled during the night. A few of the mutineer South Persia Rifles were captured The losses of the garrison had been 2nd-Lieutenant (Local Captain) G. D. M. Gywnne Griffith, R.E., died of wounds. Sergeant E. Battle, 1st South Lancashire Regiment, died of cholera. Lieutenant (Local Captain) J. W. Wdnter, South Persia Rifles, wounded. 16th 'Rajputs .—Two sepoys killed and eight wounded. The besiegers’ losses were reported to have been 50 of the mutineers killed and 100 Qashqais killed. The march of the Abadeh* relief column from Shiraz to Abadeh,* in the hottest month of the year, w 7 as a remarkably good performance, 180 miles being covered in 169 hours. 32. The relief column, together with the evacuated garrison of Abadeh,* started on its return journey on 24th July, and reached Surmaq* unopposed. The column with the evacuated garrisons of Abadeh* and Dehbid,* is due back at Shiraz about the 4th August. 33. The reinforcements which arrived in May 1918 of Burma Mounted Rifles, Mountain Artillery, and Infantry (wing 124th Baluchistan Infantry) were very young soldiers, and some of them only partially trained recruits. These reinforcements were amalgamated with the seasoned troops of their respective units, and field training and musketry were carried on in the intervals of active operations. I have much pleasure in reporting that the Indian troops of all units have throughout displayed a high standard of courage and endurance, and have been uniformly successful in every engagement. Their moral is very good. The prestige of Indian troops in Southern Persia is now undoubtedly high.8 34. I have the honour to attach herewith a list of those whose services have been brought specially to notice, in connection with these operations. Distribution. Copy No. 1.

Williams on operations against the Darashuri tribe of Qashqais in the neighbourhood of Khaneh Zinian from 10th to 23rd May 1918. On the morning of the 10th May 1918 two donkeys, belonging to the South Persia Rifles detachment at Khaneh Zinian, while out grazing, were seized and carried off by three sowers of the Darashuri tribe of Qashqais, whose migration camp was close by. Captain A. W. Will, Officer Commanding Khaneh Zinian, on hearing of this, immediately set off with 20 rank and file, 5th Infantry, South Persia Rifles, in pursuit of the robbers These he shortly overtook, re-captured the donkeys and seized the three robbers. The robbers were placed under close arrest in Khaneh Zinian fort. At 5-30 p.m , the same evening, a messenger from the Darashuri tribe came to Khaneh Zinian fort and demanded the release of the prisoners. He told Captain Will that, if he did not comply within 10 minutes, the Darashuris would open fire on the fort Captain Will refused to set the prisoners fiee. At 5 45 p.m., fire was opened on the fort. The Darashuris, about 200 in number, were in position on the three small hills to the N. and N. W 7 . of Khaneh Zinian fort. Captain Will with 50 ranks of his detachment attacked and drove the enemy off these hills which he piquetted for the night lOth-llth May 1918. The enemy lost two killed or wounded. S. P. R. detachment suffered no casualties. Captain Will reported that his detachment advanced to the attack in perfect order and shewed no hesitation. At 12-15 p.m., 11th May 1918, the following force under my command left Shiraz for Khaneh Zinian, a distance of 30 miles :— 1 squadron 2nd Cavalry, S. P. R. 1 Company, 5th Infantry, S. P. R. 1 section, 1st Battery Artillery, S. P. R. 1 section 1st Machine Gun squadron, S. P. R. 1 section Pars Field Ambulance, S. P. R. 1 troop Burma Mounted Rifles.* The intention was to drive the Darashuris from the neighbourhood of Khaneh Zinian and punish them for having wilfully attacked the fort on 10th May. At and near Deh Shaikh, on the afternoon 11th May, two small parties of Darashuris were met with and rounded up. Certain prisoners and booty captured w r ere placed in charge of the S. P. R. post at Deh Shaikh. The column arrived at Khaneh Zinian at 9 p.m., without further incident. Large encampments of Darashuris extended immediately north of Khaneh Zinian, covering approximately 8 to 10 square miles of hilly country. The w'hole tribe had not yet arrived, but its kalantar, Aiyaz KikaKhan, was reported to have arrived on the morning 11th May. At 1-45 a.m., on the 12th May, the column, reinforced by a platoon from the Khaneh Zinian garrison, leit the fort in a northerly direction. * This troop B. M. R. was made up from details left at Shiraz, of Niriz with Lieutenant-C« lonel Graut’s coin am. , (1 The B. M. JR. unit was operating north CN / k 10 Since the country was unknown and the column under my command consisted of S P. R., quite untried and far from reliable, I decided to make a direct attack, keeping my force well together. At 5-45 a.m., the column arrived in the midst of the enemy encampments and came into action. The Darashuris held the ridges to the N. W., immediately commanding the approach of the column. They were driven off three successive ridges by the infantry supported, occasionally, by the artillery, hut the guns were so old and unserviceable that they gave little material help except that the noise produced a little moral effect. One gun became unserviceable after very few rounds.* The attack culminated in the capture of the two highest peaks, that to the N. W. by the 5th infantry, i$. P. R., and that to the North by the squadron 2nd Cavalry, S. P. R. The front then occupied by the column extended from the Pul Qara Aghach hills to 3| miles to the North-East. It was then 9 a.m., and the country appeared clear of the enemy. A retirement was therefore ordered to commence from the right flank. This was the signal for the enemy, who were hidden in the hills further to the North, to make a very speedy counter offensive. Their attack was carried out by some 100 to 150 norsemen. They were surprised by all approaches being blocked and their attack was soon broken up. At 11-15 a.m., a general retirement was ordered and Khaneh Zinian fort was reached at 1-30 p.m. To begin with the Darashuris numbered approximately 1,000 men, but very shortly after the commencement of operations, some 500 to 600 went off in an Easterly direction to clear their camps and property. Enemy casualties . . .15 killed or wounded. Our casualties ... 1 man severely wounded. 1 horse killed. 2 horses wounded. The following booty was captured from the Darashuris;— 87 donkeys. 54 cows and bullocks. 30 camels. 39 mares and foals. 750 sheep and goats. Men prisoners captured totalled 36, which included two nephews of Aiyas Kika Khan, kalantar of the Darashuris, and four katkhudas. The attack w as carried out solely by S. P. R., who behaved w r ell throughout. The infantry did not meet with severe opposition but the cavalry came under heavy fire during its last attack. The enemy’s fire was erratic. At 6 p.m., 12th May 1918, a letter w r as received from Aiyaz Kika K1 an, kalantar of the Darashuris, demanding the return of all prisoners and captures and threatening that, if I did not comply, he would attack in force and take his revenge. The letter was most insolent. In my reply to Aiyaz Kika Khan, I pointed out in detail why his tribe had been punished and refused to return the prisoners and captures. The hills from which the enemy had been driven in the morning were, by this time again occupied by them. The wdiole of the Darashuri tribe. * These are two old Austrian guns. The one which became unserviceable has since been repaired*r 11 'which numbers nearly 10,000 tents, was fast arriving from Dasht-i-Arjan and could shortly muster a force at least five times my own. Letters from Aiyaz Kika Khan 'were written in terms of democratic propaganda and were so unusual in their insolent phraseology that it really appeared as if we were confronted with a stiffen proposition than we expected. Considering everything, it seemed certain that the column would meet with strong opposition on its return to Shiraz. It would be very greatly hampered by so many prisoners and captured animals. The South Persia Rifles were not sufficiently trained or reliable to undertake a dilficult march, of 30 miles encumbered arid also harassed by a mobile and determined enemy. One gun was completely out of action and the other gun could only stand a few more rounds Under these circumstances I wrote to Headquarters Shiraz putting the position before them and requesting that an Indian column be sent to Khaneh Zinian to bring my South Persia Rifles’ column to Shiraz. At mid-day, 13th May 1918, I again received a most insolent letter from Aiyaz Kika Khan. At 4-30 p.m., an Indian column under Lieutenant-Colonel B. F. R. Holbrooke, 3-124ih Baluchistan Infantry, arrived from Shiraz. Operations on 14th May 1918, near Khaneh Zinian, met with no opposi tion. The Darashuris had all retired. At 4-30 p.m., 15th May 1918, the two columns arrived in Shiraz without further incident. At 3-30 p.m.. 16th May 1918, I received a report by telephone from Captain Will, Officer Commanding Khaueh Zinian, that a Persian Officer in charge of Timouri post had sent in an urgent message to say that he had run out of w ater and that none could be obtained since his post was surrounded by robbers and the water supply was two miles distant from Timouri post. There was no report of any indications even of a general rising. I there fore ordered Captain Will with as many men as could be spared from the Khaneh Zinian garrison to proceed to Timouri immediately, taking as many w ater skins as could be procured. Captain Will met with no opposition till within one mile of Timouri post, when a sudden burst of fire was opened on him. His men took cover and returned the fire. A sangar on Captain Will’s right flank, which overlooked the road, was occupied by some 14 of the enemy. Captain Will called for volunteers to take this sangar. Aspirant II, Agha Buzurg, and six rank and file volunteered. Captain Will reported that:— “ This movement was carried out in a brave and fearless manner as the attacking party had to advance across a piece of open ground about 200 yards in length without any cover.” The sangar was captured and one of the enemy (a Kazaruni) killed. The enemy then dispersed and allowed Captain Will and his party to get through to the Timouri garrison which was thus supplied with reserve ammuni tion and three days’ water supply in skins. On 18th May 1918 Captain Will reported to me on the telephone that the Persian officer in charge Timouri post had sent word to him that be had sufficient water only for that day, that he was surrounded by the enemy and could not get to the water supply. It was then evident that the Qashqais really meant trouble. The isolated post of Timouri was obviously a danger. I therefore obtained permission from Headquarters to withdraw the garrison. I issued orders accordingly to Captain Will by telephone. The telephone wire to Khaneh Zinian was cut that night, 18th-19tli May 1918. From information obtained afterwards it transpired that the Persian officer and 11 rank and file got through to Khaneh Zinian from Timouri with their arms and accoutrements. The remaining eight rank and file with two boxes ammunition fell into the hands of the enemy. c 2t 12 Khaneh Zinian was then invested. Very few messages could get through. Two messengers were captured and killed by the enemy, others were held up at Deh Shaikh. The only two messages which got through from Captain Will were encouraging. His last was dated 23rd May 1918 in answer to one of mine. It was to the effect that he could hold out as long as was necessary and had stored ample water in the fort. This was the last heard from Captain Will. The subsequent fate of the Khaneh Zinian garrison forms the subject of a separate report and enquiry. V. P. B. WILLIAMS, Lieutenant-Colonel, Shiraz ; The 5th July 1918. } Commanding Fat's Brigade, South Persia Rifles.13 Report ot Colonel E. F. Orton on the operations against Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s forces, near Shiraz, May 24ih—27th, 1918, including the action of Deh-Shaikh, May 25th, 1918. The wing 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry, mostly trained men, and one section Indian Mountain Artillery, which had formed part of Lieutenant- Colonel Grant’s column, reached Shiraz on 23rd May 1918. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke was directed to form four companies, each 200 strong, out of the best trained men of his battalion. Fifty recruits, in addition, were detailed as assistants with the Persian mule transport, the personnel of which could not be relied on in action. The remaining 200 recruits, and all regimental baggage, were moved into a walled garden in the Shiraz perimeter. 2. Orders were issued on 23rd May 1918 for the organization of the following column, under my command Total fighting strength 1,600. Headquarters — 1 squadron, 15th Lancers. 3 squadrons, Burma Mounted Bifles. 2 sections, 36th Indian Mountain Battery. 3-12lth Baluchistan Infantry (800). 1 company, 16th Rajputs (200) and machine gun section. Indian Field Ambulance (2 dressing stations). Supply column, (men’s rations for 3 days 1 day’s barley). 3. The South Persia Rifles post at Khaneh Zinian, 28 miles west of Shiraz had been besieged since 15th May and was invested by about 1,500 to 2,000 Qashqais and Kazarunis. The post is a strong stone three-storied caravanserai and had a garrison of 110 ranks South Persia Rifles under Captain Will and Sergeant Coomber. This caravanserai contained considerable supplies of atta, barley and bhusa, and a reserve stock of 60 boxes ’SOS ammunition was stored there, to make this point an advanced base of operations in that vicinity. Saulet-ud-Dauleh, the 11 Khani of the Qashqais was known to be in camp in the neighbourhood of Khaneh Khabis, with a following of 4,000 to 4,500 tribesmen. It was known that Saulet had issued orders to his men to fire on any British column proceeding from Shiraz towards Khaneh Zinian. 4. The object in view was to defeat the besiegers, and relieve Khaneh Zinian. 5. The morning of 24th May 1918 was spent in completing arrangements, and in evacuating from the Bagh-i-Nawab and Bagh-i-Janat,* outlying gardens, into gardens within the perimeter limits, the heavy baggage and surplus stores of the Burma Mounted Rifles and the 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. The various units concentrated forward at the Bagh-i-Janat at 3 p.m., and the column marched to Chinar Rahdar and went into bivouac at 5 p.m. 6. On 25th May 1918, the column started at 4-15 a.m., and entered the hills west of Chinar Rahdar. The advanced guard under Major Bruce, 15th Lancers, consisted of one squadron, 15th Lancers, one squadron Burma Mounted Rifles (less one troop) and one platoon 16th Rajputs. The left flank guard, under Major Dyer, consisted of two squadrons Burma Mounted Rifles. When the main body had got into column of route, there was a halt of 40 minutes owing to trouble in loading the Persian mules of the supply column. At b-40 a m., the head of the main body reached the eastern edge of the Deh Shaikh valley and orders were issued for the infantry to form up in mass. *Not on Map.•Sketch No'. I. At 0-45 a.m., the enemy was seen to be in occupation of San^ar Hill* and Kutal Hiil,* and considerable numbers of mounted and dismounted men were seen moving about on Kuh-i-Phan.* At 6-45 a.m., the enemy on Sangar Hill* opened fire on the advanced guard. The platoon 16th Rajputs, from the advanced guard had been doing hill picquetting and had fallen behind, so was kept back to rejoin its company. 7. The plan of Saulat-ud-Dauleh was a very obvious one. He caused men to shew themselves and open fire, on the road westwards towards Khaneh Zinian, hoping that the hulk of the British column would he committed to an action westwards. He would then attack from the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal,* with a view to cutting off the column from Chinar Rahdar, and to surround ing the British column eventually. After studying the ground I resvolved— (i) to capture Sangar Hill* and Kutal Hill,* and thence work up the N. W. spur of the Kuh-i-Phan,* (ii) after achieving (?) to attacK with the bulk of my force southwards, across the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal,* towards Saulat’s camp near Khaneh Khabis. 8. The Officer Commanding 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry was directed to detail one company to go forward to assist Major Bruce. This company (Baluch company, under Captain Gardner) was given Sangar Hill* as its objec tive. The Officer Commanding Mountain buttery was directed to detail one secticn mountain artillery (.Lieut. Pender Smith), (escort one troop Burma Mounted Rifles which had been detached from the advanced guard squadron, to the head of the main body) to go forward to Deh Shaikh post to support the attack on Sangar Hill.* As the attack on Sangar Hill* developed, considerable mounted reinforce ments of the enemy appeared on the N. W. end of Kuh-i-Phan.* These were shelled by the rear section of guns (Captain Willis) and Officer Commanding 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry w T as directed to detail one company (Punjabis under Major Stewart) to attack the N. W. end of Kuh-i-Phan.* At 9 a.m., Sangar Hill* was captured, and Stew T art’s company was pro gressing up the N. W. end of Kuh-i-Phan.* Major Dyer, with two squadrons Burma Mounted Rifles, had occupied the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal* by 7 am, driving off the enemy picquets found there. Dyer’s horse was shot under him. Dyer then occupied the B. M. R. ridge, the highest of the low hills between the Kuh-i-Phan* and the Shiraz barrier range. At 8-30 a.m., Dyer reported enemy opposite him increasing rapidly in numbers. ; Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, with the remaining half battalion Baluchis, to which was attached Willis’s section of artillery, w T as ordered to advance and reinforce Dyer. To make good Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal,* to engage the enemy, but not to advance more than half a mile south of Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal* lor the present. I wished to accept a fire-fight on the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal* hills, and not to press the attack there until the w estern flank had been visited by ine, and the forces there re-organized and given fresh orders. Having done this, I intended to return to Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal* to resume control there. Having started off Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke’s force about 9-45 a.m., I left the supply column under the company 16th Rajputs, and galloped to Sangar Hill,* accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Grant and small escort. At 10 a.m., I met Major Bruce, on Sangar Hill.* Gardner’s company w r as just taking Kutal Hill.* Stewurt’s company was getting a footing on the N. W. end of Kuh-i-Phan.* Bruce’s mounted troops were reforming from among the low hills on the N. side of Sangar Hill.*15 ♦Sketch. I informed Bruce that Stewart’s company would make good Kuh-i-Phan.* and that he should derail one troop B. M. it to hold Sangar Hill * I gave orders myself to ihis troop commander (DafadarHalia Singn) to hold Sangar Hill* until nightfall ; to fire at all parties of enemy c ming from the direction of Khan eh Zinian ; at nightfall, failing other orders, to fall back on Deh Shaikh* S. P R. post I explained my general plan to Bruce, told him to collect his squadron and remaining troops of B. M. R. (3 cavalry+ 3 B. M. R =6 troops), and proceeded to Kutal Hill * There he would give the following directions to Captain Gardner, together with any further details necessary to co-operate in his (Bruce’s) mounted advance. “ Captain Gardner's company will occupy a position on Kutal Hill,* where he will be joined bv Lieutenant Pender Smith's section mountain artillery, and these two units must act together. Captain Gardner will work his way up Kuh-i-Phan,* as Bruce's force advances S. E. down the valley towards Khaneh Khahis, and Pender Smith's guns will afford Bruce any long r toge artillery support that he can manage. When Pender Smith's section joins Gardner, his escort troop B. M. R. will rejoin its squadron, now with Bruce.' Pleadquarters galloped back to the reserve, which was reached at 10-30 a.m. On the way Pender Smith’s section artillery, and its escorting troop B M.R., ■were sent to join Gardner’s company on Kutal Hill.* Some rations and one box *303 ammunition were put into Deh Shaikh S. P. R. post, into which the dressing station evacuated two or three wounded men. At 10-45 a m., orders were issued by helio to Stewart to hold the summit ©f Kuh-i-Phan.* 9. At 11 a m., T moved the baggage, supply column, dressing station and escorting company 16th Rajputs southwards to near Ak Chashmeh,* where the mules were collected under cover of a low ridge (Transport Hill) and picqueta were posted. The situation as I found it at Ak Chasmeh* and Garden-i-Sagavi* about 11-45 a M., was as follows :— Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke with one company (Captain Dobbs) was on the Kutal. Captain Wetherall’s company was at Transport Hill. Willis s •ection artillery was a mile further North, not in action. Dyer with two squadrons B. M.R. was on B. M. R. ridge, where there had been some close fighting and the enemy from tbe main mountain ridge was threatening Dyer’s left flank. On one occasion four B. M. R. scouts fell hack. The enemy galloped up the hill and dismounted on the crest, where they were charged by two dis mounted troops B. M. R, with the bayonet, 36 enemy being killed. This gallant charge was led by Major Dyer. I ordered Willis’s section of artillery forward to Transport Hill, and sent Wetherall’s company forward up the Gardau-i-Sagavi Kutal.* I sent Lieute nant-Colonel Grant forward to get into touch with Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke. When Willis’s section arrived at Transport Hill I allotted one platoon 16th Rajputs under Lieutenant Crocker as escort and took it to the Kutal, and sent it thence to reinforce Dyer on B. M. R.* ridge. I then saw Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, directed him to hold the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal* with one company already there (Dobbs) while I took Wetherall’s company higher up on to B. M. R.* ridge. When Lieutenant-Colonel Grant and I arrived on B. M. R.* ridge 12-25 P.M., we found Dyer somewhat hard pressed. At 12-30 P.M , Willis’s two guns came into action in the centre of B. M. R.* ridge and WetheraU’s company prolonged the line on the left, and beat back the outflanking attempt of the enemy with heavy Lewis gun and rifle fire. From 12-30 f.m. to 1-30 r M. a heavy fire fight occurred at ranges from 400 yards to 1,100 yards, and the enemy gradually fell back to the longer ranges. The enemy’s rifle fire was heavy and continuous.16 •Sketch. The enemy’s rifle fire at short ranges was accurate, but at ranges over 500 yards was inaccurate, and w r e had a great advantage in being able to keep the fire fight at ranges of 700 to 1,200 yards where our Lewis guns and artillery were most effective. At 1 p.m. Dyer’s two squadrons B. M. B.. were sent down to the Gardan-i- Sagavi Kutal,* under cover, to reform and refill ammunition. Parties of the enemy 15 to 20 strong were seen on the crests of the main Shiraz range and were kept off with an occasional shell at a range of about 4,000 yards. At 1-35 p.m. Stewart, on the summit of Kuh-i-Phan,* was directed by me by helio to send half his force S. E. down the hill to help Holbrooke to advance. Stewart sent forward Gardner’s company with Pender Smith’s section of guns. It w'as a stiff climb down broken rocky ground, and enemy snipers had to be cleared out. 10 The tents of Saulat’s camp could be seen in the valley about five or six miles to the south. I consulted with Lieutenant-Colonel Grant and w r e both agreed that a decisive attack must be made to beat the enemy decisively and drive him back and it was best to attack straight for Saulat’s camp. Any sign of retreat or withdrawal would be fatal and could not be contem plated. The animals had been several hours without water, and we must fight our way forward to the water at the site of Saulat’s camp. All available troops to be collected in the cover of the low hills south of the Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal,* and thence to attack due south, supported by heavy covering tire from B. M. It.* ridge directed against the hills due south of B. M. R.* ridge, whence the enemy’s tire could enfilade the main attack. I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Grant to organize the main attack, while I re mained on B. M. R.* ridge to direct the supporting fire and w T ateh the situa tion At 2-15 p.m. Captain Wetherall’s company (less one platoon with a Lewis gun under Lieutenant Golden) was sent by me to join the main attack as there were indications that the enemy’s fire against B. M. R,.* ridge w r aa slackening. There were now left on B. M. R.* ridge Willis’s section of guns with escort one platoon J6th Rajputs, and one platoon 3-124th Baluchistan Infan try. For the main attack the following troops were assembled on and near Gardan-i Sagavi* Kutal :— 2 squadrons Burma Mounted Infantry. 3 companies (less one platoon) 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. Lieutenant Pender Smith’s section artillery. About 1-45 P.m. I had despatched Jemadar Sher Muhamad (Guides Cavalry) to Sangar* hill, to ascertain the situation there and return and report to me. He got back to B. M. R.* ridge about 2-45 p.m. He told me the troop B. M. R. there had twice been approached by 200 to 300 mounted enemy who retreated west when heavily fired on. He reported large clouds of dust four to five miles west of Sangar* Hill. I was continually apprehensive of enemy reinforcements arriving from Khaneh Zinian, but I knew that a decisive defeat of Saulat’s force was the best protection against this eventuality. About 2-15 p.m. I received a helio message from Stewart from the summit of Kuh-i-Phan* that our cavalry w T as in the valley due south of Kuh-i-Phan* and another ire r sage about 3-45 p.m. that Major Bruce had been killed. A few of the enemy, at 3-30 p m. attempted to comedown from the main moun tains round our left flank on B. M. R * ridge. The fire of Lieutenant Golden’s Lewis gun kept them off. I ordered the transport and escort to advance up to Gardan-i-Sagavi* Kutal, where they would be more concealed, and less exposed to long range fire I considered also that the advance of the transport at this juncture, would exercise a moral effect on the enemy flankers high up on the main mountain ridge to the East, as shewing them we were winning and advancing.17 % About 3 p.m. the main attack was launched, and a heavy covering fire was opened from B. M. R. ridge, Willis’ guns doing excellent practice. The main attack occupied the first ridge of the low hills beyond the tufangchi* tower about 4 p.m. and the enemy was already in full retreat, towards the south-east. The tufangchi tower was captured by the Burma Mounted Rifles its garrison of 12 men being killed, nearly all by Lewis gun fire. ° About 4 p.m I had sent a helio message to Stewart to work his way south east half way down the Kuh-i-Phan.* I had then lost communication with him, and had to trust him to conform to the general advance. Major Stewart informed me later that after leaving the summit he was unable to get into helio communication with me. He saw the progress of the decisive attack but did not know whether the column would camp for the night on the Qara A°*ach* river, or fall back. He therefore did not evacuate Kuh-i-Phan* until 7 &amp; p.m when he saw the transport nearing the site of. Saulat’s camp. 11. The main advance at 4 p m. was making good progress and I deter mined to follow it up quickly with the remainder of the troops and th transport. . It to °k s?me time to communicate w ith the various picquets. Willis* section of artillery was moved down from B. M. R * ridge to Gardan-i-Sagavi Kutal,* and the transport and protective troops were got under way by 5 p.m. Passing through the low hills, the open valley was reached just after sunset, 6-40 p.m., and a bright full moon was rising. Dyer’s B. M. R. squadrons w ere halted here. The firing of the main infantry attack under Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke was heard in the neighbourhood of the site of Saulat’s camp. A few enemy were reported to be on the line of low hills across the valley 3,000 yards to the south, Willis’ guns shelled these hills (6-50 p.m. to 7-5 pm) and^ also shelled the fires of a small camp of the enemy due east at a range of 2,500 yards (7*5 p.m. to 7-20 p.m.). The enemy fled and by 8 p.m. there w r as no sound or sign of them. The impetus of retreat had thus been continued into the night hours, and there was not any reasonable likelihood that the enemy would rally and trouble us during the night. 12. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke had selected a good defensive site for a perimeter camp, on the Qara Agach* river bank. The rear guard reached camp at 8-15 p m. Stewart’s company reached the camp at 9-50 p.m. The squadron, 15th Lancers, and squadron, Burma Mounted Rifles, under Captain DeBrath, w'ere missing. The two squadrons had joined Stewart on the top ot K.uh- 1 -Pkan* about 3 p.m. and Stewart had directed DeBrath to follow his company down off the hill. They had evidently lost their w T ay after sunset. At 10 ‘ 30 P - M - a report was sent, in duplicate, by two Persian agents bv different routes, to Shiraz. ^ i u! 13 V The ^ P assed quietly in camp. The troops stood to arms at 4 a.m. hair an hour before dawn. Until 7 a.m. troops were given a rest and cooked rood. Prom 7 a.m.^ until 10-30 a.m. the Burma Mounted Rifles under Major Dyer, with one section, mountain artillery, advanced three miles south-east to a group of nine Surkhi villages. This group of villages is called Siakh. The in habitants are attached to the Qashqais and are noted robbers and raiders. Small groups of Qashqai mounted men emerged from the various villages and fled to- wards the south-east and south. A few shots were fired at the Burma Mounted Rifles from the villages, especially from Darjngun, Karabas and Aiur. The villages and the fleeing Qashqais were shelled. Some debris on the site of Saulat’s camp, tent poles, hay, two horse jhools etc., was collected and burnt. J At 1 i 2' 30 A ^yer was half way back towards camp, and the column was started off towards Deh Shaikh.* * Sketch. £&gt;18 * Sketch. My intention was to proceed to the relief of Khaneh Zinian ; either on the afternoon of 26th May, if the troops were not too tired, or on 27th May. The advance guard reached Deh Shaikh at 1-16 p.m on 26th May. I found Captain DeBrath there, with the missing mounted troops. I also found a group of refugee S. P. R. men from Khaneh Zinian at Deh Shaikh,* and I soon gathered from their confused accounts, that CaptainWill and Sergeant Coomber had been treacherously murdered by the South Persia Rifles garrison the previous afternoon, and the post given up to the Qasbqais and Kazarunis. 16. A perimeter camp was formed at Deh Shaikh. Reinforcements from Shiraz reached Deh Shaikh* at 2 p m. consisting of one section artillery, with refill gun ammunition for the other two sections, one troop South Persia Rifles’ cavalry, two platoons, 16th Rajputs. Also two carts loaded with forage The wounded still remaining with the column were evacuated in these two carts, and the troop, South Persia Rifles’ cavalry and two platoons 16th Rajputs, were sent back to Shiraz. Lieutenant-Colonel Grant proceeded to Shiraz and returned in the evening by motor with explosives which might be required to blow in the gate of Khaneh Zinian fort. I issued orders during the afternoon 26th May for the march on 27th May of the column to Khaneh Zinian. Lieutenant-Colonel Grant from Shiraz, got back to Deh Shaikh about 7 p.m. on 26th May. He informed me that the situation at Shiraz was bad, and might be described as critical. The Shiraz democrats were making the most of the Khaneh Zinian affair, which was being described as a Qashqai victory. The defeat of Saulat’s force was not believed by the Persians in Shiraz, and the anti-British party were giving out that the column had been surrounded by Saulat and could not return to Shiraz. The South Persia Rifles in Shiraz were in a nervous state. It was known to me that the existing state of affairs was the culmination of a wide-spread anti-British plot, engineered from Tehran, to turn the British out of Southern Persia, and to break up the S. P. R. I realized that the continual absence from Shiraz of the column of Indian troops was a danger. On the other hand, it was desirable to strike a blow against the enemy at and around Khaneh Zinian. My latest information was to the effect that the enemy had put about 150 men into Khaneh Zinian fort, and that about one thousand Kazarunis and Qashqais were camped about four miles west of Khaneh Zinian, where the country is broken, difficult, and covered with scrub jungle. The infantry of the column half of whom are partially trained recruits were much exhausted. Supplies with the column were almost finished, and only about half a day’s rations for the men remained in hand. The supplies and reserve ammunition stored in Khaneh Zinian, to make it an advanced base for a column, had been removed by the enemy. finally, the retaking of Khaneh Zinian might prove a difficult task. It is a strong, stone-built, three-storied caravanserai, and an unsuccessful attempt to take it would be worse than to leave it alone for the present. In the circumstances, I decided to return with the column to Shiraz on 27lh May. 16. The column left Deh Shaikh* at 5-30 a.m., 27th May, and reached Shiraz 10-30 a.m. I withdrew the S P. R garrison of 12 men from the Deh Shaikh* post. This post had been merely a link towards Khaneh Zinian, and was no longer required among the hills. On 26th May a small supply column of carts had been asked for, from Shiraz to Deh Shaikh,* to form a supply depdt at Deh Shaikh* for the column to fall back on after dealing with Khaneh Zinian, on 27th May. These supplies were no longer necessary. The carts were met at Chinar Rahdar, and returned to Shiraz on 27th May with the column.19 At Shiraz the stories told by the returned Persian muleteers convinced its inhabitants to some extent that Saulat’s force had suffered a severe defeat. 17- dt is estimated that about 4,500 of Saulat’s men took part in the actual fighting on 25th May. Of these about 2,000 were mounted men, -very mobile* whose tactics may shortly be described as “Boer tactics,” and their ponies are extremely nimble in getting about even on the highest hills and mountains. The enemy’s armament consisted of Mauser rifles (60 per cent.) with pointed bullets, Lee Metfords and Lee Enfields (30 per cent). No smoke powder, such as from Martinis, was used by the enemy. Saulat had two maxims, in the low hills facing B.M.R.* ridge. The enemy had plenty of ammunition, and maintained a heavy fire all day- The enerny did no entrenching, but constructed many stone sangars. These stone sangars afforded good targets for artillery and Lewis gun lire and the blood stains showed that many casualties, occurred in these sangars. The sangars w r ere generally small ones, for one or tw r o men, and sited usually along the crest of a spur rather than on the main sky line of a hill. The squadron, 15th Lancers, had two Hotchkiss guns. Each squadron of Burma Mounted Rifles and company of infantry had two Lends guns (total 16). We also had the maxim section of the 3-j 24th Baluchistan Infantry and of the 16th Rajputs. The shooting of the enemy was very accurate at shoot ranges. At ranges over 500 yards it was not accurate, as they can neither observe long range fire, nor adjust their sights. In spite of this, probably half our casualties were caused by the heavy long range fire maintained by the enemy. The enemy fought bravely and pressed in quickly to attack whenever there appeared to be a sign of hesitation or retirement, or whenever there appeared to be an opportunity of turning a flank. Two or three attempts were made to retake .Kuh-i-Phan* from the north-west and the south-west ends. On one occasion Lieutenant Pender Smith’s two guns going up Kuh-i- Phan* were charged by about 200 mounted enemy. The attack' w 7 as beaten off by gun fire (fuze zero) and the rifle fire of part of the escorting infantry. 18. The squadron 15th Lancers (Captain De Brath) and Squadron Burma Mounted Rifles (Risaldar Gulzar Singh) under Major Bruce, in the valley south of Kuh-i-Phan,* advanced towards the ruined viHage of Khaneh Khahis.* About 12 noon, Major Bruce advanced the squadron 15th Lancers to seize a position on an outlying spur on the south side cf Kuh-i-Phan, and himself advanced with Risaldar Gulzar Singh’s squadron of Burma Mounted Rifles to a line in the open valley about 800 yards north of Khaneh Khabis* sending forward a dismounted troop into the ruined houses. Constant skir mishing occurred against parties of mounted Qashqais, and this fighting pro bably exercised considerable moral effect on the enemy. The squadron 15th Lancers was brought up about 12-30 p.m. into line with the B. M. R„ in the plain. At 1-30 p.m. two or three hundred mounted Qashqais opposed the dismounted men of the B. M. R. in Khaneh Khabis*. Major Bruce withdrew his advanced dismounted men and about 1-45 p.m sent back the squadron 15th Lancers to reoccupy the spur of Kuh-i-Phan*. The enemy at once pressed in to attack and to surround the B. M. R. squadron and Major Bruce and five men were shot within a few seconds. This w^as about 2-30 p.m Risaldar Gulzar Singh beat off the enemy’s attack by fire, inflicting about 40 casualties. Captain DeBrath, from the supporting position, arranged a covering fire with his two Ho toll kiss guns, and galloped forward himself with six men, to bring in the killed and wounded. The enemy fell back, and the three dead and twm wounded were brought back, together with Gulzar Singh’s squadron, to the covering position. It was now about 3 p.m. Owing to the conformation of the ground, Major Bruce and Captain DeBrath had lost touch with the rest of the force, and Major Bruce had decided to retire to the top of the Kuh-i-Phan,* w r hich he knew to be held by our troops. There are only twm partially trained signallers wdth the squadron 15th Lancers. It would have been more useful to my plan if Captain DeBrath had kept in position on the low T er spur, and had sent up a patrol to * Sk tch.20 \ 1 % the summit to ascertain the situation. The decisive attack was just bein&lt;* launched, and the co-operation of DeBrath’s two squadrons on our right flank' at this juncture would have had great effect. The subsequent wanderings of these two squadrons, by night, would also probably have been avoided. Incidents of this nature, however, are apt to occur when units become detached in hilly country, and in case of doubt it is more sound to concentrate towards the centre than to remain isolated. 19. Our casualties on 25th May were 18 killed and 33 wounded. The casualties of the enemy are estimated at 250 killed, 450 wounded. 20. Throughout these operations I received invaluable aid in every way from Lieutenant-Colonel G. P. Grant, P.S.O. Major (acting Lieutenant- Colonel) E. H. Dyer, proved himself a gallant and able leader. E. P. ORTON, Colonel, Shiraz ; The 30th May 1918. 1 Deputy Inspector General, South Fersia Bifles. *21 * Sketch. Report by Lieutenant-Colonel G. P. Grant, D.S.O., on the decisive attack and advance to Saulafs camp. Action of Deli Shaikh. 1. About 1-1 5 p.m., Colonel Orton discussed the tactical situation with me. We agreed that there was only one course to pursue a resolute offensive towards Saulat’s camp and water. A retrograde movement towards Deh Shaikh,* or even to water half way at Ak Chasmeh,* would most certainly be followed up by the Qashqai, and would have given colour to Qashqai claims to a success. On the other hand, the capture of Saulat-ed-Douleh’s camp, apart from its moral effect on the tribes, was calculated to create a favourable impression at Shiraz, where the attitude of the populace and of the South Persia Rifles gave us cause for anxiety. 2. Colonel Orton instructed me to collect and organize a force for this advance to the Qara Agach* valley, and to direct the movements of this force, while he. directed the covering fi#e from B. M. R ridge for the main attack and while he protected the left flank and rear of the main attack. 3. The plan was briefly, to attack the right of “ Red ”* hill and “ White ’* tower, the right flank being protected by Gardner’s Baluchis, supported by Pender Smith’s section of guns on the southern slopes of Kuh-i-Phan.* The capture of tf Red hill would outflank the enemy’s strong position about “Rouble Head* Hill”, and would offer a good position for covering fire for the next “ bound ” towards Saulat’s camp. 4. I explained to Major Dyer, Commanding Burma Mounted Rifles, the tactical situation, and directed him to form up in readiness to co-operate with the 124th Baluchis in their attack on “ Red ” hill, and in their subsequent advance towards Saulat’s camp, where it was proposed to bivouac for the night. Major Dyer was directed to move on the right, or western flank of Holbrooke’s Baluchis, straight for the “ White” tower. His advance would be covered by a section mountain guns (Captain Willis) in action on B. M. R.* ridge, and also by a section of guns (Lieutenant Pender Smith) on the southern slope of Kuh-i-Phan.* 5. I then rode forward to the Kutal* to give instructions to Lieutenant- Colonel Holbrooke. He informed me that his unit was much scattered, and that he only had three platoons available for the advance to the Qara Agach* valley. I explained-that Wetherall’s company, less one platoon, was already on its way to support him, and I was able to point out that Gardner’s company to his right front, making their way down the rocky southern spurs of Kuh-i-Phan. Behind Gardner’s Baluchis could be seen Pender Smith’s guns limbering up in xeadiness to move forward in support. I explained to . Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke the arrangements for the artillery support from B. M. R.* ridge and from Pender Smith’s section on Kuh-i-Phan. 6. I gave Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke as his first objective the right portion of “Red”* hill, a frontage of some 250 yards. I directed him to get in touch with Gardner on his right front. “Red”* hill was already being swept by Willis’ section from B. M. R.* ridge, but did not appear to be so strongly held as the group of hills further east, noticeably “ Double* headed” hill and hill to the south-west of it; here, from my position to a flank, I could see many riflemen. I warned Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke’s adjutant to be prepared for a heavy flanking fire from these positions, when crossing the open stretch separating their position on the Kutal from “ Red ”* hill. The force organized for this decisive attack consisted of :— 2 squadrons Burma Mounted Rifles. 3 companies 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. 1 section mountain artillery (Lieutenant Pender Smith). 7. The advance commenced at 2-45 p.m , and was carried out with great dash by the infantry, supported by Willis’ and Pender Smith’s guns.22 * Sketch, The enemy opened machine gun and magazine rifle fire at a range of about 1,200 yards from their flank position about “ Double* Headed ” hill causing a few casualties. The low tumulus was utilized by us as a covering fire position. 8. I sent back Subadar Major Ali Dost to report the situation to Colonel Orton, and to ask him to move up the baggage close behind the infantry advance, for, were this not done, a dangerous gap would widen between me and the baggage, compelling me to arrest the main attack before water could be reached. Colonel Orton had, however, already taken action, and I could see the baggage under escort moving forward. 9. Our infantry were soon seen clambering up the north-west slope of “ Bed ”* hill, from which the enemy were driven. On the right of the infantry Dyer’s B. M. B. moved rapidly across the open to the “ White ” tower, on which a heavy Lewis gun fire was opened. None of the defenders escaped, most of them being shot through the loop holes. On the right of the B. M. B., Gardner’s company of Baluchis was co-operating, clearing the spurs of Kuh-i-Phani as it advanced, and beating off attempts of the enemy to outflank our advance. 10. Pender Smith’s guns had left Kuh-i-Phan* and were now entering the plateau near “ White '’ tower. I directed that officer to come into action in support of the next “ bound ” of the mounted troops, which were reforming about “ White ” tower. 11. “Bed”* hill, an important “ point d’appui ”, was now in our hands. The Q.ashqai main position about “ Double* Headed ” hill had thus been turned, and their communications were threatened. The enemy now seemed to lose heart, and parties of them could be seen retiring south-east. The B. M. B. pushed forward from “White” tower towards Saulat’s camp, which could be distinctly seen about 7,000 yards away on the bank of the Qara Agach. In rounding the south-west base of “ Bed ”* hill, the B. M. B. came under machine gun fire, and were forced to swung south-east along a nala, covered to some extent by fire from “ Bed ”* hill, until they reached the eastern end of a spur running into the open Siakh valley. Here I found Dyer’s B. M B. in action on the left of the Baluchis but unable to advance. Dyer explained the situation, and asked for artillery support to enable him to cross an open stretch of valley between his position and Saulat’s camp. His line of advance was flanked from two low% isolated hills to the south-east, at a range of 1,200 to 1,500 yards. Dyer reported that some 300 Qashqai mounted men were in position behind these tumuli. Pender Smith’s guns had meanwhile unlimbered about 800 yards west of the B. M. B. and w r ere in action ready to support Holbrooke’s advance I ascertained that the impetus of the infantry advance was being maintained, thanks to the Lewis gun covering fire. I accordingly brousht Pender Smith’s guns up on Southern* ridge in support of the B. M. B advance. The tw T o hillocks referred to above were shelled at a range of about 2,700 yards. Searching fire behind the crests forced the enemy to leave this cover, and the plain w r as soon covered with galloping horsemen moving in too open a formation to offer good targets to our guns. The enemy fled in the direction of Dar Bah and Kading, shelled by Pender Smith’s guns up to 4,500 yards. 12. These guns next opened fire at 5,000 yards on Saulat’s camp in the Qara Agach* valley. Several effective shrapnel were observed over the camp and valley beyond, w-hich could be seen crowded with baggage animals and escort. 13. It w r as now T 6 p.m., and we were still 2^ miles from water, I directed Dyer to push on wuth his B. M. B. to “ Bed ” bluff, a prominent hill on the east bank of the Qara Agach, and overlooking our probable bivouac site. The enemy had been observed collecting on this hill for some lime. Pender Smith’s guns w ere moving forward to shell this bluff wLen an urgent request for artillery support was received from Gardner on the right His company—all young soldiers—were exhausted, and were subjected to a heavy flanking fire23 from the spurs to the west. The sectio-n mountain artillery was accordingly directed further west to support Gardner, but Holbrooke’s rapid advance eased the tactical situation to such an extent that the guns were able to return to their original task—that of supporting Dyer’s advance on the left. f Hsd bluff was shelled, and the B. M. It. moved forward and occupied this position and the river bank with little opposition. 14. The action closed about 7-30 p.M. by which time Holbrooke’s infantry had driven the enemy across the Qara Agach* river, though a desultory fire from the hills beyond was kept up by the enemy’s riflemen for some minutes. Holbrooke’s infantry in this last advance had succeeded in driving the enemy from a series of parallel spurs, seven in all, thanks to a judicious use of their Lewis guns. They had been on the move for 16 hours, and had been fighting incessantly for nearly 14i hours. 15. I laid out a perimeter camp* on the north bank of the Qara Agach* Animals were placed in a hollow offering good protection from snipers, especially from across the river. By 8 P.M. the enemy had disappeared, his retreat being marked by clouds of dust down the Siakh valley and westwards towards j£uh Marreh. G. P. GBANT, Lieutenant-Colonel, General Staff, South Persia Bifles. Shiraz ; The 12th June 1918 .} * Sketch.25 reported Burma Mounted Rifles still hung up; and Officer Commanding column arriving about same time, the two guns and D company were moved to their help. D company soon drove off the enemy and moving forward two platoons prevented the enemy from getting round the left of Burma Mounted Rifles. Enemy retired and D company was sent back to rejoin me for an advance on a long hill (one tree* hill, not on sketch) distant about a mile. C company was also now coming off the southern slopes of Kuh**i-f Phan ; as soon as C company was nearing, I moved off with A company. We came under some long range fairly accurate flank fire from a high hill on out left, but “ one tree* hill ” was occupied without opposition. f ihe Burma Mounted Rifles now swept ronnd the right of the hill and turning to the left came up on to a ridge 600 yards in front of me. I went forward and spoke to Major Dyer, and he agreed to take his Burma Mounted Rifles off to the open country to the left of ridges, while I advanced straight forward ; at the same time I sent orders to C company to come on in Echelon behind my right flank to protect it. The advance was distressing work ; as each ridge was topped we found a dip down and another in front 600 to 1,000 yards off. Each ridge was held by the enemy who fired fairly heavily on us. But Lewis and machine guns drove them off and the advance continued. The opposition got less, and eventually some two or three hundred mounted men rode off in the direction of Khan eh Khabis.* A strong party of them later, suddenly appeared on C company’s right flank as if to about to attack, but this company beat them off and Captain Gardner is of opinion that he inflicted a good few casualties. It was now late and camping ground and water-supply was required. I, therefore, not being in communication with officer commanding column, directed the advance on a highish hill, which it could be seen overlooked the river. We were still fired on, hut not heavily; this last hill however was occupied by the enemy and lor a moment it seemed as if they meant to try to prevent us getting the water by daylight. However D company fixed bayonets, hut when within 400 yards, the enemy retired, the hill was occupied, and a few fleeting enemy were speeded up on the way by Lewis guns. Time was about 6-50 p.m. Nothing more was seen of the enemy and the camp was not molested. A and D company suffered following casualties during the day :— A company— Killed ...... Captain Dobbs. Wounded ...... 4 men. D company— Killed Wounded . 1 man. 1 man. Total casualties in battalion—killed 8, wounded 10. This new 7 battalion of mine worked exceedingly well all day and I am very pleased with it. There was plenty of go and dash even late in the even ing after 14 hours w r ork, C company was rather exhausted, but had more marching than the other companies and fewer halts. The ccmpanies were very well commanded, and the company commanders all speak w 7 ell of their subordinate leaders. It w as a good stiff trial for a young battalion, and it stood the test well and I am more than pleased with it. Shiraz ; The 1st June 1918. B. E. R. HOLBROOKE, Lieutenant-Colonel, 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. * Sketch, t „26 Re{ ori on operations of “ C ” Squadron, 15th Lancers, on 25th»26th May 1918, and Gulzar Singh’s squadron, B. M. R. (Captain N. S. DeBrath). Marching from Chinar llakdar post at 4-15 a m. on 25th May, the squad ron formed part of the advance guard, under Major Bruce, consisting of the squadion, 15th Lancers, one squadron B.M R., less one troop and a platoon of 16th Rapjuts. Advance patrols came under fire at Burj-i-Beh Shaikh* from Sangared* hill west of the Burj The squadron was then advanced, dismounted through low hills to a position, held tightly by enemy mounted troops, North of the Sangar ^ hills. From that posilion the squadron reached the Sangar* hills in conjunction ^ with the three troops B. M. B. and one company (Gardner) d-124th Baluchistan Infantry who were advancing from the East. Leaving one troop B. M R. as a picquet holding Sangar hill with orders to tall back on Burj-i-Deh Shaikh* at sunset, the squadron with remaining two troops were ordered to shoulder round and, co-operating with Gardner’s com- pany, 124th Baluchistan Infantry and Pender Smith’s section of guns 36th Mountain Battery), attack on the right flank in a south-easterly direction towards ipaneh Khabis* The main attack by the column being made from the north in a south-westerly direction on the enemy’s camp which could be seen on the river bank seven or eight miles away. -n About 10-75 am. the troops B.M. R. which had been doing escort to 1 ender Smith s section of artillery rejoined Gulzar Singh’s squadron. At about 10-30 a m. the squadron with the three troops B. M. R. crossed the range of hills and descended into the plain about four miles north-west aneh Jlhabis. I he plain was scattered with small bodies of enemy mount ed troops who retired as we advanced. When within li miles of a small village in ruins, Khaneh Khabis,* heavy fire was opened from the range of hills on the lert and from the open plain on the right. Major Bruce ordered forward the squadron at a gallop to take a small spur on the left front and covered his advance with the three troops B. M. R. The enemy about 150 strong left ihe hills on the left and retired into the low hills south-east of the ruins. Major ^ r j lC ?- a&lt; ^ Vance ! a P os ^ on i n the open about 800 yards away from the ruins and dismounted. The squadron was then brought forward to prolong the line of the B. M R. to the right. At about 12-30 p.m., one troop B. M, R. Mere sent tornard and took possession of the ruins under a heavy fire. ® n tering the valley nothing had been seen or heard of our own troops /On the Jelt nank and all attempts to establish communication by helio to the top of the hills had failed. • t.-i 1 P r0 P cs . ed t0 M ajor Bruce that a patrol should be sent to the top of Kuh- i-l ban to gain touch nith the rest of the force as we had lost touch for some time. Major Bruce however considered it advisable to keep the two squadrons together ana nearer to our troops on the hill. • u At about 1-30 p.m. enemy mounted troops were seen working round our right flank in the plain. Also a heavy columry of dust in the low hills to our right rear was observed. There was also no sound of fighting in the low hills to our front where it was thought the main attack was to be delivered. It was therefore decided to retire on to the bills to our left rear. The troop of B M R were therefore ordered lo retire from the ruins which they.did under heavy fire.’ Ihe enemy at once leaving the low hills and advancing into the plain. Major Bruce then ordered the three troops and Hotchkiss gun section, 15th Lancers to retire quickly on to the spur to the left rear originally held. This was clone only one man being hit. The enemy then advanced and closed in on our ngbt flank still further. A heavy fire was being maintained on the led horses which were ordered back by Major Bruce. The tvo troops B. M. R. then started to retire dismounted at about 2 p.m. Heavy covering fire was given from the spur and fire was kept up by the dismounted men as they retired. When the latter were within 500 yards of the spur, two troops 15th Lancers were ordered to take up a position half way up the hill to the north-east to cover the further retirement. The led horses were also sent out tp meet the B. M. R. On their reaching the spur it was reported that Major Bruce had been killed in the position from wdiich. the retirement had begun. Two other men of the * Sketch.27 B. M. R. were reported Ijing witli him, badly wounded. Volunteers were called for to assist bringing them in and Risaldar Gulzar Sing was ordered to keep up a heavy covering fire to the front and right flank. Two men of the B. M. R. and four men 15th Lancers were taken out at a gallop. An Indian officer with three more men B. M. R. followed at a little distance to give further help. At sight of the party, the enemy to the front retired further back. They were apparently looking after their own casualties which, judging from the number of riderless horses in the plain, seemed to be considerably heavier than our own. Major Bruce’s body was recovered and the two men B M.R. with him were also brought back to the spur also two other men B.M.R. slightly wounded. All the casualties were inflicted by enemy on the flank. Between 3-15 and 3-30 p.m., the 2 squadrons, and the casualties reached the top of the hill which w r as found to be held by a company 124th Baluchis tan Infantry under Major Stewart, M.C. From there it was observed, about 3-30 p m , that two squadrons B. M. R. were in the low hills east of Khaneh Khabis.* Information on the situation was asked for from Major Stewart who ordered the squadron and two troops B. M. R. to follow his retirement half way down the hill towards the south-east at 4-30 p.m. This was done, three troops 15th Lancers being left in possession of the highest points on the hill. At 7 p m., Major Stewart started to descend the hill and half an hour later the squadron with the B. M R. followed, to join the column in camp. Being uninformed as to the position of the bivouac of the column, search was made towards a low mound to the south-east on which fires had been ob served from the hill at about 7 pm On nearing the ground, it was thought to be in possession of enemy so at about 10-30 p.m., it was decided to return to Burj- i-Deh Shaikh* as neither men nor horses had watered since 8 a.m., that day and ammunition was very scarce. At mid-night it was found we were on the road about two miles from Chinar Rahdar, so it was decided td'proceed to that post for the night. At 4-45 a m. on 26th we returned to the low hills east of Khaneh Khabis* but were able to find no trace of the column. At 9 a.m. we proceeded to Burj-i-Deh Shaikh* and were found there by the troop B. M, R. who had been left on picquet on Sangar* hill the day before. Twm troops were then sent up to picquet Sangar hill and to watch for movement of the column which, it was thought probable, had proceeded towards Khaneh Zinian. Information had been received at 4 a.m. from two Persian officers and some 30 men S. P. R. who arrived at Chinar Rahdar that the post at Khaneh Zinian was in the hands of the enemy. They them selves having escaped without rifles at 5 p.m. on 25th instant. At about 1-30 p.m. the column arrived at Deh Shaikh* and the squadron and three troops B. M. R. rejoined.

Orton on the action against Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s forces, Bagh-i-Janat-Kushan, Near Shiraz, June 11th, 1918. A. column of Indian troops assembled at Shiraz at 9 a.m. on 11th June 1918, for a tactical exercise under my command. 1 Squadron, 15th Lancers. 3 Squadrons, Burma Mounted Bifles. 36th Indian Mounted Battery. 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. 2 Company?, 16th Rajputs, and M. G. section. Indian Field Ambulance (2 dressing stations). 2. Reliable information was received at 8-45 a.m. that parties of Kazarunis had advanced from Chinar Rahdar* into the Bagh-i-Janat* and Kushan* village, and that 200 or 300 Kazarunis had moved forward to Masjid-i-Bardi village. e e I resolved to give some reality to the tactical exercise, by shelling the enemy out of Bagh-i-Janat* and Kushan*, and see whether such action would make the enemy vacate Masjid-i-Bardi.* One squadron, 2nd Cavalry, South Persia Rifles, under Captain Chapman, was sent 3 miles south-west of Shiraz, in observation, to guard our left flank, and worked well. 3. One section mountain artillery was left in occupation of an entrenched position near the cantonment perimeter, wheie there is an excellent field of five to cover an advance or a retirement. Certain strong points along the line of march, on both flanks, were occu- | pied by small units, to make good each “ bound ” of advance and of the subsequent return march. A line 2.U00 yards from the Bagh-i-Janat* was occupied by 10-10 a.m. just west of the Afifabad* outpost, and called the “ Abambar * position. ” From 10-20 a.m. to 10-50 a.m. the Bagh-i-Janat* and Kushan* village were cleared of the enemy with a few shells and some long-range machine gun fire. About 300 Kazarunis retreated, some mounted and some on foot. 4. The Burma Mounted Rifles then advanced past the south side of the Bagh-i-Janat* to beyond its western border. Two companies, 3-124th Balu chistan Infantry, made good the gardens of the Bagh-i-Janat* and the vineyards on the Kushan* side, after a little skirmishing, in which one sepoy of the Baluchis was wounded. One section mountain artillery was then pushed forward to the west side of the Bagh-i-Janat,* and fired a few shells into Chinar Rahdar* fort at long range, 1L30 a m.— 12 noon. Lieutenant-Colonel G. P. Grant had been sent forward by me, to co ordi nate the movements of the advanced units and I had ordered the retirement to commence at 12 noon at latest. I remained at the “ Abambar position, * to observe the right flank, and to cover the retirement. 5. At 11-45 a.m. about 200 men from Masjid-i-Bardi* retired out of the gardens on my right flank, and retreated to the lower spurs of the Kuh-i-Barfi . A few shells were fired at these men at rangos of 3,000 to 4,500 yards, and some casualties were observed. 6 The rear guard of the advanced troops were clear cf the Bagh-i-Janat* by 12-25 p.m. and the enemy was kept back by 2 or 3 shells, and did not press the retiring troops. A steady retirement was practised back to Shiraz, where the cantonments were reached at 2 p.m. without molestation by the enemy. 7. The main object of this day’s operations was to give practice to the young troops and young officers, in advance, in retirement, and in the co-opera tion of all arms Also to b arn the value of various tactical features of that locality. (* Are shown in Sketch ill.)K FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.33 One point I realized was the danger of committing young and inex perienced Indian troops into large gardens and plantations sucli as those along the line Bagh i-Janat* and Kushan* village. 8. On our return to Shiraz* it was found that a Punjabi Nark of the 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry, (a Saiyad), was missing. It was stated by men in his company that he was last seen in the vineyards close to the Bagh-i- Janat,* and that he was apparently unwell. He fell into the hands of the enemy, was taken to Saulat’s camp, was well treated, and dressed in Qashqai clothes. There is a reasonable suspicion that he deserted. 9. The enemy’s casualties were ascertained by subsequent reliable reports to have been 6 killed and 14 wounded. Our casualties w'ere 1 wounded and 1 missins:, E. F. OBTON, Colonel, . Deputy Inspector General, South Persia Rifles. Shikaz ; The 11th June 1918.34 Report on attack on the post at Afifabad on the night 13th-14th June 1918. {Fide Sketch No. IV.) The Adjutant, 16th Eajputs. Shit'az, 3rd July 1918. In accordance with instructions received from the Officer Commanding^ I submit herewith Subadar Hari Singh’s report on the attack on the Afifabad post. “On the night of the 13-14th June 1918 at 9-30 P.M., a dog in the post beo-an to bark loudly. I got up and visited the sentries. At 10 15 p.m. the dog ao-ain excitedly barked at all four corners of the post. I again ^ot up and told the sentries to wake all men on guard duty. I returned to niy room and at that moment the enemy opened heavy fire from all directions. The reserve fell in and 1 reinforced the guard at the main gate. I then went with a bomber to the north-east tower, there appeared to be many enemy in the Bagh- i-Gulshan, and some of the enemy were firing from the vineyard at a range of a few yards only. I ordered one bomb to be thrown into the vines and two bombs at the buildings in the Bagh-i-Gulshan ; this caused the enemy to retire at these points. My men had commenced opening fire about five minutes after the enemy had commenced their attack. The enemy then began a very heavy fire against the north-west corner, at the same time coming through a door from the Bagh-i-Gulshan, I opened fire on the door and had a bomb dropped in that direction. At 10-45 p.m , the firing ceased, and loudly shouting the enemy charged, in some places they appeared to be in three lines. “ I proceeded to the south-east corner, there were several enemy at the base of the wall and one man in a tree within a. few feet of the top of the wall. I drove these men off with rifle fire and rifle grenades. At about 11 p.m. fire ceased on both sides. Shortly afterwards a man, apparently a Mullah, climbed a tree in the Bagh-i-Gulshan and for about ten minutes harangued the enemy in a loud voice. The enemy again opened fire and advanced shouting. I bombed whenever the enemy appeared to be massing, the whole of my reserve was now in action and a follower helped to distribute ammunition, At about 11-45 p.m the enemy withdrew and the same Mullah harangued them for about 15 minutes, the enemy again opened fire. A few enemy again advanced towards the south-east corner, we drove them off with rifle fire. “ An attack now developed in the north-east corner urged on by the above mentioned Mullah, fire volleys from the four men in the tower prevented the attack developing and the Mullah seemed to be effectively silenced. “ I then took up a position over the gateway; the enemy in front used much abusive language and a man shouted in good Hindustani “ Subadar Sahib phatak kolo .” The action continued on all sides ; at 2-30 a m. there was a general shout of what seemed like “Ham inja” and the enemy retired ; firing continued from the direction of Bagh-i-Gulshan till dawn. “ At about 7 am. next morning the villagers reported that some men had come into the Bagh-i-Gulshan to remove four dead bodies that had been left behind. My casualties were one sepoy died of wounds, two sepoys slightly wounded, four of my rifles were damaged by the enemy fire I estimate the enemy as not less than 500, they left no bodies behind but much blood was seen at various points. My men expended 2,109 rounds, nine bombs and seven rifle grenades.” B. F. GARBAT, Major, Officer Commanding, “ A ” Company, 16th Uajputs.^9 35 Report of Colonel E. F. Orton on the action of Ahmadabad, near Shiraz, against Saulat“Ud=Dauleh’s forces, 16th June 1918. [Fide Sketch No. Ill) On the evening of 15th June, it was known from reliable agents that the enemy had about 800 men along the line Ahmadabad-Khusan ; about 200 in the lower slopes of the Kuh-i-Barfi ; about 300 men in Masjid«i-Bardi ; about 300 or 400 men under Nasr Diwan at Chinar itahdar. Saulat-ud- Dauleh with 2,000 to 3,000 men was near Deh Shaikh. Disturbances were being got up among the fanatical population of Shiraz City, and Saulat had issued a written notice that he intended shortly to attack the British and occupy Shiraz City. 2. It was resolved to attack Saulat’s forces, inflict considerable casualties and upset his plans. 3. After allotting the minimum garrison necessary to hold the perimeter of the cantonment (i) of the Indian troops {ii) of the South Persia Bides, the following troops were available for offensive operations under my com mand :— (i) Left flank guard, to observe the chain of low hills three miles south west of Shiraz, against any attempt of Saulat to send a force across the Siakh pass.

Mountain Artillery , . . j (200) 2 dressing stations from Indian Field Ambulance. 4. My plan was to hold the enemy’s frqnt along the line Bagh-i-Janat* Kushan-Khu-i-Barfi with Lieutenant-Colonel Yanrenen’s force, which had a F 2 r36 strong tactical pivot in the Afifabad mud fort. The threat of Vanrenen's force v ould keep many of the enemy out of the main fight. To march with mv mam column direct on Ahmadahad and seize a position on the chain of low hills south of Ahmadabad. After securing Ahmadabad to fight as far for ward to warns Chmar Rahdar as suited my purpose of inflicting casualties and then to return to Shiraz. 5. The various columns assembled at 5 a.m. near the Indian troops canton ments. Commanding Officers and Adjutants came to Headquarters at 1-45 A.M,, and were given various instructions verbally. I gave special instructions, with a sketch map, to Lieutenant-Colonel V anrenen as 1 had had previous experience of the ground around Afifabad, and I gave special warning of the danger of an attack to turn his position from Ins right rear through the J3agh-i-Gulshan and other gardens there. 6. Shortly after 5 a.m., four rounds were fired from the Schneider field gun at ranges of 6,&lt; 00 7,000 yards, into the mass of gardens where Masi’id-i- Hardi lies Ibis was to draw the enemy’s attention to the flank away from Ahmadabad. By 5-30 a.m , the troops were in motion along their appointed • i 6-50 a.m , the Burma Mounted Bifles had pushed on quicklv into Ahmadahad village, from which the enemy’s picquets retired on to the low hills about 1,500 yards south of Ahmadabad. At the same time the guns with the main column fired on a few of the enemy on the plain midwav between Ahmadabad and the Bagh-i-Janat. ^ * „. lieutenant-Colonel Dyer sent two squadrons at a gallop on to the chain or low hills south-east of Ahmadabad and so secured a footirg on the hills. _ My main column readied Ahmadabad village about 7-15 a.m. and Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer’s three squadrons were in action on the top 5 of the chain of low hills one mile to the south-east. r About 7-30 a.m , I directed Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke to detail one company (Captain Gregory) to capture “ Mottled Hill,” supported bv 'mns and by the enfilade fire of the 8. M. Bifles. The Sikh platoon of the Khattak company attacked with fine dash and captured thesangars at the summit the Kazarunis retreating in such haste that they left four dead behind, a most unusuai thing lor these tribes. The Sikh platoon had one man killed and four wounded. About 8*30 a.m , I directed Officer Commanding, 3-124th enemy m a nullah about 1,&lt; 00 yards off in the direction of Chinar Bahdar By 9-30 a.m., considerable mourned reinforcements from the direction of Chinar Bahdar had galloped behind End Hill ” and heavy Lewis o-un fire was employed 'rom “ Mottled Hill ” and Brown Hill, ” together with indirect gun fire from Ahmadabad on the reverse slopes of “ End Hill.” The bulk of the enemy fled westwards up the steep main range about 10 a.m., and suffered many casualties. 7. Meanv bile, Lieutenant-Colonel \aiirenen had fired occasional shells into Kushan and the lower slopes of Kuh-i-Barfi, and employed some long rano-e maxim and Lewis gun fire. About 9-30 a.m., there was hea^y firino 1 from his force, and I could see he was hotly in action against the enemy attacking his right rear through the line of gardens. After about 15 minutes the firino’ slackened, and 1 received a helio message to say the enemy’s attack had been beaten back. The troop 15th Lancers, on that flank, had failed to detect the enemy s approach, and fell back. The section of artillery under Lieutenant Backett swung round the two guns, and fired 17 rounds with fuze at zero Aided by a heavy fire from Lewis guns and rifles this attack was soon beaten oil. One gunner was wounded, and it was ascertained subsequently that the enemy lost 10 killed and 8 wounded After this experience the enemy made no further attack against Lieutenant-Colonel Vanrenen’s flank force. 8. About 10 a.m, I withdrew the Burma Mounted Bifles from the hills and directed Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer to move up the middle of the valleyabout half way towards Chinar Rahdar. As soon as .the B. M. Rifles were under way, I directed Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke to detail half of Captain Wether all’s company with Lewis guns to hold Ahmadabad fort, and I moved about 800 yards up the valley with four guns, half a company, and the Head quarter troop. Stewart’s company advanced from “ Brown Hill ” to &lt;c End Hill, ” which was easily captured by 11 a.m., and the enemy was retreating in all directions. 9. About 10-20 a.m., Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer had been attracted across the valley by the groups of enemy retiring along the foot of the Kuh-i-Barfi towards Chinar Rahdar, and he became engaged with these, and asked for artillery to shell good targets. I sent across one section of artillery escorted by my Headquarters troop of cavalry, which then rejoined me. Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer inflicted considerable casualties on the retreating enemy. Chinar Rahdar fort was shelled, and the 2,000 or so of the enemy who had been in the valley all retreated beaten and discouraged. I noticed considerable numbers of mounted enemy in the hills west of Chinar Rnhciar, whose numbers were increasing, and I surmised these were * Vide Sketch No. i. reinforcements of Saulat’s Qashqais from Heh Shaikh and Ak Chasmeh.* The troops had had seven hours’ marching and fighting. I estimated that about 250 casualties had been inflicted on the enemy mostly against the Kazarunis. Our casualties so far had been only 1 killed* and 8 or 9° wounded. The Kazarunis were defeated and practically out of the fight, but I realized there were fresh Qashqais to deal with, and that they would attack as soon as we began to fall back. There was not much gun ammunition left. I ascertained that the section in front with me had 40 rounds per gun. By 11-30 a.m., I had issued my orders for the withdrawal. It was essential as a first step to get back the section of artillery from the Burma Mounted Rifles to Ahmadabad. I sent across Lieutenant-Colonel Hamilton to arrange this together with an escort of one troop Burma Mounted Rifles ; as I did not anticpate the enemy would counter-attack until the Burma Mounted Rifles mov^ed, which they could do fairly rapidly. The Burma Mounted Rifles were to trot back, as soon as Stewart’s Company was off “End Hill.” 10. The section of guns with me near “ End Hill” kept back the Qashqai horsemen by an occasional shell beyond Chinar Rahdar, while the other section marched to Ahmadabad, which it reached about 12-5 p.m. The bulk of Stewart’s Company was now off “ End Hill,” but the move ment was slow, and the last platoon stayed up too long. The Qashqai horse men were showing signs of advancing. At this moment a man on the top of £{ End Hill ” was severely wounded and the blanket stretchers of the company had all been used for previous casualties ^ It took 15 minutes to get this wounded man to the foot of “ End Hill,” and the Qashqais were getting thick round Chinar Rahdar. I sent two sowars of my Headquarters troop with a led horse, to the foot of “ End Hill,” who carried off the wmunded man to Ahmadabad. The advancing Qashqais were kept off with rapid gun fire, while the Burma Mounted Rifles, w T ho had been delayed dangerously, mounted and trotted back. The guns limbered up and it was a race for Ahmadabad. Meanwhile, the Khattak Company came nimbly and quickly off “ Mottled Hill,” and reached Ahmadabad village. The guns at Ahmadabad checked the direct rush of Qashqai horsemen, and many of the Qashqais swerved towards Kushan, with the obvious inten tion of getting into the plantations around Bagh-i-Janat. At 12-15 p.m., the advanced section of guns have fallen back to a line of karezes 1,000 yards east of Ahmadabad and were in action, and the troops&amp; 38 and dressing station at Ahmadabad were all clear except Wetbeiall’s half company with Lewis guns. The Burma Mounted Rifles were about 700 yards from the west Janat gardens, when three or four hundred Qashqai horsemen charged down straight from the direction of Chinar Rahdar, and at the same time fire broke out from west Janat, severely wounding Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer and Captain Murray. The unit had taken a line rather too close to the Bagh-i-Janat. Hampered by wounded men and horses, the Burma Mounted Rifles stood and faced the Qashqais for half an hour. Fortunately the enemy’s fire was wild. Two or three groups of Qashqais galloped down the nullah towards Ahmadabad. These were driven back by the Lewis guns of WetheralPs half company. One of these groups had eight men and horses killed out of ten, at a range of 400 yards. Ahmadabad was evacuated shortly afterwards, and the enemy kept away from this village for some time. The four guns fired rapidly over the heads of the Burma Mounted Rifles and into west Janat and inflicted many casualties. The Burma Mounted Rifles used Lewis guns and rifles with great effect, against Qashqais who occasionally got within 200 yards in the first rushes of the attack. I sent Subadar-Major Ali Dost at a gallop to Lieutenant-Colonel Vanrenen, with directior.s to open rapid gun fire against the southern edges of Bagh-i- Janat, and this had great effect. The Headquarters troop of cavalry was sent forward at once, to reinforce the Burma Mounted Rifles. While I was making these arrangements, I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Grant and Jemadar Sher Muhammad to Officer Command ing, Burma Mounted Rifles ^Captain Thacker) ordering the Burma Mounted Rifles not to remain halted, but to fall back slowly and continually through the infantry line which was moving up to help them. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, in charge of the infantry rear guard, moved up Wetherall’s company towards the Burma Mounted Rifles and 1 sent forward, at the same time, the platoon of Stewart’s company which was doing escort to the rear section of guns, into line with Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke then ordered up the remainder of Stewart’s company in support, and made a further advance up to the Burma Mounted Rifles, now slowly retiring. The increased volume of fire caused the enemy to fail back, and at about 1-15 p.m., the main fire fight was over. The Burma Mounted Rifles with their 4 killed 15 wounded and 29 wounded ponies fall back slowly through Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke’s line of infantry which had been moved up. The rear section of guns had 2 rounds left when the fire fight slackened off. It limbered up and fell back with the Burma Mounted Rifles. Infantry with Lewis guns were easily able to keep off the enemy, whose heavy losses caused complete discouragement. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke handled this infantry rearguard with skill and coolness. The troops waited for half an hour on a line in continuation with Afifabad fort, firing an occasional round of shrapnel, but the enemy did not come on. The troops returned to Shiraz in good order, and the rear guard was in at 3-30 p m. 11. The losses of the Qashqais in this rear guard fighting are estimated at over 200. Saulat’s bodyguard troops alone are reported to have lost 42 killed and 85 wounded severely. The Qashqais showed great dash and mobi lity, and stood heavy losses in the open without giving up the fire fight. 12. There are four main factors which brought about the situation in which the Burma Mounted Rifles were caught:— (i) The fact that Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer went across the valley, about 2 miles away, and got engaged with parties of the enemy on the Kuh-i-Barfi. (ii) The fact that I yielded to his demand for a section of guns, to inflict losses on the bodies of enemy retreating on that side of the valley. The threat of the Qashqais had not materialized when I sent the section across, but I knew I must withdraw this section before beginning a general retirement, thus showing a39 i sisjn of retirement half an hour before the methodical retire- ment could begin, {iii) The slowness in coming off “ End Hill ” by Stewart’s last platoon ; and the unfortunate casualty to a sepoy just as it was about to move off the hill. {iv) The fact that the Burma Mounted Bdfles took a line of retirement too close to Bagh-i-Janat. ° • 13. The Burma Mounted Bifles were retiring in line of squadron columns, and this formation has been criticized, as being too close, when under fire at ranges of about 7C0 yards from West Janat. The unit was forced into a close formation by the oncoming charge of mounted men straight from Chinar Rahdar. When the fire broke out from West Janat, the direct charge had to be repelled at the same moment. The Officer Commanding and one squadron Commander were severely wounded, and there was some unavoidable confusion when change of com mand occurred, and the unit only had two other British officers. The Indian ranks rose gallantly to the occasion, and beat off the attacks, with help from the guns and infantry, and got away finally with all their killed and wounded. The unfortunate situation produced a good result in reality, because as against 4 killed and 15 wounded on our side, an opportunity arose to inflict about 200 casualties on the Qashqais in a short and severe fight. The Burma Mounted Rifles casualties included one South Persia Pvifles muleteer killed and one wounded. The Persian muleteers have an intense admiration for the Indian troops in general, and the Burma Mounted Rifles in particular, and are attached permanently to units and fraternize with them. 14. The Kazarunis and Qashqais who were driven out of the valley during the advance probably numbered 2,000. The Qashqai reinforcements which attacked us during retirement probably numbered 1,200, and were aided by parties of the Kazarunis. The losses of the enemy are estimated at 200 killed and 300 wounded. Our casualties were 5 killed and 24 wounded. E. E.

My column proceeded to take up a position west of the Bagh-i-Gulshan in accordance with instructions. On arrival, Bagh-i-Janat, the village of Kushan and the adjoining vineyards were shelled and later on a certain amount of Lewis and machine gun fire were directed on them, but no reply was received and apparently there was no enemy in there. As the other column appicached the other side of the valley, X was able to bring a good deal of artillery fire on bodies of the enemy advancing along the low range of hills near Ahmadabad ; and on one or two sangars held by the enemy on the slopes of the Kuh-i-Barfi, 1 ^ At about 9-30 a.m. some of the enemy had worked into the Baghs on my right flank and my right rear. For 10 minutes my position was enfiladed and X had hurriedly to re-adjust my force. The section of guns under 2nd- Lieutenant Backett did very good work. They were quite in the open without any cover and were under very heavy rifle fire, both he and the Indian officer are deserving of great praise for their great coolness. Major B. F. Garratt, 16th Bajputs, too, acted with commendable promptness in bringing his reserves almost at once into action and in the general handling of his° men. The enemy retired after about 20 minutes. I took great precautions to protect my right flank with one troop cavalry and one platoon infantry, but in spite of this the enemy managed to come up unseen through the Baghs which run for a long way, and it was impossible to thoroughly search them without weakening my somewhat small force. Later on in the day when the retirement of the other column commenced I direcltm a good deal of artillery fire west of the Bagh B i-Janat and also in the Bagn itself which was reported to be held by the enemy on the south side. I did not commence my retirement till the rear guard of the other column had got well behind my position. During my retirement to Shiraz there was no opposition. G. B.

It was intended to shell the enemy Afil'abad fort, and to give some practice in advancing and retmng. It was not certain whether the Qavvam’s tufangchis tad^ withdrawn during the morning of 22nd June from the Bagh-i-Muhammadiyeh, halt way to Afifabad. . 2. The following Indian troops assembled near the perimeter, at 10-A.M. . 1 squadron, 15th Lancers. 2 dismounted squadrons, Burma Mounted Bides. 2 sections, 36th Indian Mountain Battery. 3 coys. 3-124th Baluchistan Icfantry (each 150 strong). 2 coys. 16th Bajputs (each 150 strong). Also one Schneider field gun, South Persia Bifles, manned by British N.C.Os under Captain McIntyre, B A. One section, 36th Indian Mountain Battery, occupied the prepared gun position under the defences of the Bagh-i-Nasiriyeh, to deal with any opposi tion on retirement. . 3 Three companies, 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry, took up a flank posi tion at the Bagh-i-Muhammadiyeh. One squadron, 15th Lancers, and two dismounted squadrons,' Burma Mounted Bifles, took up a position covering the left flank. Two sections, 36th Indian Mountain Battery, and the Schneider field gun, S.p.B escorted by two companies, 16th Bajputs, took up a position sout i of the Bagh-i-Muhammadiyeh by 10-45-A M., about 2,000 yards from Afifa a . 4 Afifabad fort was shelled and the garrison bolted About a dozen shells were fired into the Bagh-i-Gulshan, on the north side of Afifabad. 5 At 11-15 -a m., the force began to fall back, unopposed, and got back to the perimeter at 12 noon. One shell from the Schneider field g lin ™ fired at an enemy picquet on Kuh-i-Baba (north side of Shiraz, range 4,800 yards) and two shells towards a low hill overlooking Bulvardi village (nort west of Shiraz, range 3,200 yards.) 6 . It was afterwards ascertained that the enemy casualties were 3 killed and 3 wounded. We had no casualty. ^ ^ Deputy Inspector Generali South Persia Bifles* Shikaz ; \ 27th June 1918.)42 0* P m Report of Colonel E. F.

T he enciny h a d hpit a sangar oa a low hill, about 3,200 yards north west of the perimeter. There were known to he about 70 of the enemy in 400 m the gardens around Masjid-i-Bardi and Bulvardi village, and about Bagh-i-Nawab. Between Masjid-i-Bardi and Chinar Rahdar there were several hundred more of the enemy, but it was not anticipated these would come into action on Te ToTths^of St Balm Kuh - i - Baba aild about 500 in support (a) (J) i -n 2 ' i 11 wa , s . mtended t0 mak e a short night march, seize the spur and low lulls where the sangar was built, fire into the Masjid-i-Bardi 1 village and gardens, and then withdraw, after inflicting some casualties. 3 The first light of dawn was at 4 a.m. By 4-30 a.m. it was sufficientlv light to employ aimed rifle fire. By 4-45 A.M. it was light enough for artillery observation. It was arranged that Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke with two companies (Khattak Company under Captain Gregory and Baluch Company under Captain Gardner) should start at 2-30 a.m., seize the Kutal and Lht knoll about 3-30 a.m. and rush Sangar hill with the bayonet at 4 a.m. . Tlle arrangements were kept secret and orders to the supporting units were at 3 Ta M^al the perimeter JUUe ' ^ tr0 ° PS Were t0 a '“ Semble («) Two companies J 6 th Rajputs, with machine gun section, under Bieuten ant- Colon el G.

This point is about 700 yards from the nearest houses of Bulvardi village ; the corner tower and walls of the Bagh-i-Kapshgar about 600 yards south-west of the Ah A mbar.

The 36th Indian Mountain Battery to come into action at the perimeter, close to the Bagh-i-Nasiriyeh, whence the range to Sangar hill is 3,200 yards, and whence there is a good view to the north, west, and south. 4. The orders were carried out without a hitch. The Baluch Company occupied the Kutal and right knoll about 3-45 a.m. Only one man was found in a small sangar. He fired two shots and was then bayonetted by a Baluchi. Sangar hill was rushed at 4 a.m., but was found unoccupiedr Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke waited until 4-40 a.m., and then fired a few shots at small parties of the enemy seen moving about. At 4-50 a.m,, Lewis from Sangar hill against parties of the enemy who occupied a hill l, 0 b 0 yards further west, and also into Masjid-i-Bardi village and Bulvardi village. &amp; The guns fired a few rounds into Bulvardi village, and some indirect fire over ban gar hill under observation signal arrangements previously made with Colonel Holbrooke. , The retirement began at 5-40 a.m. and small parties of the enemv tried to advance, but were easily kept back by Lewis Gun fire and a few rounds from the guns. (it?) / OH'-’*0 48 The supporting troops fell back in their turn, under mutual support, and were treated to a good deal of long range rifle fire, which was not effective. The last party was back at the perimeter by 6-45 a.m. 5. The enemy’s losses, from information subsequently obtained, are esti mated at 12 killed and 20 wounded. Our casualties were two slightly wounded, who remained on duty, including Lieutenant F. B. Honeyball, 3-124tk Baluchistan Infantry. 6 . The moral of the enemy was already somewhat low. They had been discouraged by the disproportionate losses they invariably suffered. This small action was fought in full view of the inhabitants of Shiraz City, who were much impressed by the way the Indian troops worked. Our agents brought information that the talk in the enemy’s camps was about the impossibility of success against guns and Lewis Guns. Shiraz: The 30th June 1918. i E. F. OBTON, Colonel, Deputy Inspector General, South Dersia Rifles. g %44 Report of Colonel E. F. Orton on the operations against Saulat=ud=Dauleh’s forces, near Shiraz, July 7th«8th, 1918, including the action of Chinar Rahdar. (Sketches T and V.) On June 29th ) the Baharlu Kalantar with about 300 men, left Saulat’s Camp, and rejoined his Khamseh Chief, the Qavvam-ul-Mulk at Shiraz. On 29th and 30th June, the bulk of the Darashuri Qashqais left the Saulat and joined Muhamed Ali Khan Qashquli, a long standing enemy of the Saulat, who had come near Shiraz from the north when hostilities began. The Qavvam-ul-Mulk became the recognized leader of the anti-Saulat party, and there were frequent conferences with the Sardar Ektesham, the elder half-brother of the Sauiat and ex-11 Khani, and Muhammad Ali Khan Qashquli who came into Shiraz on 1st July. Ali Khan, Salar Hishmat, the younger full brother of Ekteshsam, was „„ .. commanding the 500 Qashqais who had * On m»p i -4 miles. cap t ur ed Bajgah,* and broken up the tele- graph line and road leading towards the north, Ali Khan came into Shiraz on 1 st July and joined the anti-Saulat confederacy, being made II Begi (2nd- in-command) of the Qashqais by Earman Farma. The Qashqais and Kazarunis had been promised an easy victory over the Indian troops, the division of large spoils in the shape of rifles, ammunition, treasure, stores, and the personal effects of British officers. Also the sacking of Shiraz City. The heavy casualties suffered by the Saulat’s forces, in the various engage ments; the summer heat to which the Qashqais are not accustomed in these lower altitudes ; the losses among their flocks owiog to grazing becoming scarce in the hills near Shiraz ; and lastly the siroag perimeter of the British lines which the enemy dared not attack, caused great' discontent among the tribesmen, who were willing to leave the Saulat for a new II Khani, and so attain their object of proceeding with their flocks and families to their summer haunts. After the losses inflicted on the Kazarunis on 27th June, when the Qashqai did not come to their aid, the Nasr-i-Diwan quarrelled with the Saulat. On 2nd July there was another quarrel over looted crops and two Qashqais were killed. The Kazarunis then began to leave the Shiraz Valley for home, simultaneously with the Qashqai defections from the Saulat’s Camp. Nasr-i-Diwan and the last 300 Kazarunis left Deh Shaikh for Kazarun about 5th July. On 6 th July the Saulat wrote an urgent appeal to Nasr-i-Diwan to return, but Nasr-i-Diwan replied from the neighbourhood of Dasht Arjan that what was proclaimed at the beginning as a jehad , or Holy War, had degenerated into an inter-tribal Qashqai affair, and he Nasr-i-Uiwan preferred to have no more to do with it. Besides which he had not so far seen much of the promised loot. Saulat’s force was dwindling, but he remained near Shiraz, began to spend money freely, to redouble his intrigues, murdered several villagers and headmen by the way of intimidation, and sent in threats of murder and violence to various Persian nobilities in Shiraz, some of whom began to get frightened. There is little doubt that the delay and hesitation by Earman Earma in issuing a sanad to appoint the Sardar Ehtesham as II Khani of the Qashqais in place of the Saulat, was having a bad effect on the anti-Saulat Confederacy. In fact the Qavvam stated clearly that he would retire from all the negotiations unless the sanad be issued. Earman Earma, naturally, was afraid to assume such responsibility, fearing his own Government at Tehran. He wished to wait until the telegraph line was repaired and then refer the matter to the Persian Government. The Consul at Shiraz supported Earman Earma in this view. Erom a military point of view, however, the matter was too serious to brook any delay whatever, and a coup d’etat against Saulat was an urgent military necessity. The Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, and his staff insisted and pointed out that the Saulat had destroyed the telegraph and therefore EarmanParma must take the responsibility, to save Shiraz City. At midday on 3rd July Farman Farma gave his reluctant consent. He signed the sanad on 4th July, and issued it publicly on 5th July. From a military point of view, it was now necessary to strike a blow against the Saulat’s remaining forces, and to arrange a plan with the newly appointed II Khani and II Begi, the brothers Sardar Ektesham and Ali Khan Salar Hish- mat, to pursue the Siulat and finish him off, or at least to drive him away from the neighbourhood of Shiraz. It is the custom in Persia, in such a case for the following of the deposed man to desert him, and for the following of the new man to loot the belongings of the outgoing incumbent The train having been laid, it remained to fire the mine. 2. At a Conference held at Force headquarters on the morning of 7 th July, between the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, and his staff, and Sardar Ektesham and the Qavvam, it was arranged that a column of Indian troops would undertake the main fighting, at dawn on 8 th July, in the neighbourhood of Chinar Rahdar. Saulat’s Camp was at Ak Chasmeh, about 7 miles south- nest of Chinar Rahdar. Saulat had about 1,100 men with him, of whom about 300 were not fighting men, but only armed followers. Saulat’s advanced guard of about 200 men was iu and around Chinar Rahdar The Qavvam would send some Arab tufangchis, to move at dawn on 8 th July over the high mountain iange south of Chinar Rahdar, to come down on Ak Chasmeh Camp when the Indian troops had had a good fight with Saulat’s men. The Sardar Ektesham and Muhammad Ali Khan Qrshquli to seize the tufangchi tower on the top of the Siakh pass by dawn on 8 th July, and to be prepared to descend into the Siakh Valley and take up the pursuit of the Saulat as soon as the Indian column defeated and put him to flight. In dealing with our allies it was necessary :—- (i) To leave a good garrison in the Shiraz perimeter, with a small move- able column for any emergency. This consisted of—• One Squadron, 15th Lancers, One section, Indian Mountain Battery, 200 Indian Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Dyer, who was on light duty, on recovery from his recent wound. (ii) To watch the movements of our Persian Allies, and to see that they were duly playing the part allotted to them in the fight and in the subsequent pursuit. (in) To fake precrutuns not to fire on our Persian Allies, or to have any unfortunate encounter. 3. The following troops were detailed to form a column under my com- l and:— Officer Commanding Column Staff .... 3 Squadrons, Burma Mounted Rifles . 1 Squadron, South Persia Rifles Cavalry . 2 Sections, 36th Indian Mountain Battery 3-121th Baluchistan Infantry . . Wing, 16th Rajputs . . . . . Colonel E. F. Orton. . Lieutenant-Colonel G P. Grant, D.S.O., General Staff. Major J. W. S. Hobson, D A. A. and Q M. G. Subadar-Major Ali Dost, Intelli gence. . . . 270b Under Major &gt; Chapman, South . 80 J Persia Rifles. . 200 . 520 . 320 Total . 1,390 2 Dressing stations, Indian Field Ambulance. South Persia Rifles mule corps, for units and supply column.4. By 2 pm. special light scales of kit and transport had been drawn up and issued to all concerned. Additional water pakhal mules were allotted, owing to the heat in day-time, especially for hill fighting. Three South Persia Bifles fourgons were taken filled with bhoosa^ to form a depot of forage at Chinar Bahdar. 5. The column left Shiraz at 6 p.m. The mounted advanced guard entered the gardens and walls of the line Bagh-i-Janat-Kushan at 7-15 p.m. and skirmishing began The two squadrons, B. M. Bifles, in the advanced guard were reinforced by the third squadron. At 7-30 p m. the main column was among the walled enclosures of West Janat, and the volume of the enemy’s fire increased. The wing, 16th Bajputs, was sent forward under Lieutenant-Colonel ( 1 . B. Vanrenen, who extended his two companies., one on each side of the road, and took over the advanced guard from the mounted troops, and pushed steadily ahead towards Chinar Bahdar. - At 7-45 p.m. it w r as getting dark and it was desirable there should be no check while the rear of the column w 7 as still among the vineyard enclosures of West Janat. A wing of the 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry, therefore, was sent forward under Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, to support the Bajputs, if necessary. The enemy indulged in a good deal of firing both from our front and our right flank, but the number of the enemy opposing was probably not more than 150. A steady advance was continued, and all firing ceased at 8-15, when the advance guard was close to Chinar Bahdar fort. One man of the Burma Mounted Bifles was slightly wounded, and there was no other casualty during this night skirmishing of the 16th Bajputs. One sepoy had the butt of his rifle damaged by a bullet, an Indian officer had a bullet though his pagri, and two sepoys had bullets through their clothing or equipment. This advance was skilfully carried out by the 16th Bajputs under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel G. B. Vanrenen. * 6 . There is a water channel and a mill with a tower, in the open plain near Chinar Bahdar, and it was intended to form a perimeter camp at this point, so as to avoid any necessity for hill picquets. It had been estimated tnat this mill and water channel were not less than 1,500 yards from the fort and from the nearest hills. The perimeter camp was paced out, markers were placed, and units and transport guided from the road to their places. The rear guard was in by 9-15 p.m. The perimeter was entrenched, and Lewis Guns were allotted to corners. Orders were issued for picquetting pegs to be firmly driven in. The South Persia Bifles Cavalry and South Persia Bifles Transport were placed well inside' the perimeter, which w as 100 yards by 100 yards. The troops had been so used to perimeter camps, that there was no con fusion in taking up their places, even in the dark. The enemy cut-off the stream of water as soon as they discovered we were camping, but there were sufficient pools at the mill for our requirements. 7. At 2-30 a.m, a party of mounted Qashqais, estimated at forty, opened a heavy fire from horseback into the camp, from a distance of 200 or 300 yards on the north-w T est side. The enemy raised loud shouts, hoping to cause confusion and to stampede our animals. Simultaneous ly a lieavy fire started from the river bed, 400 or 500 yards away on the south side. The barking of dogs had put our sentries on the alert, and a Lewis Gun of the Baluchis, at the north-west corner, opened fire about five seconds after the enemy’s first shot. For about one minute there was heavy firing from both sides, and the enemy then retired altogether. There was no alarm among the Indian troops There was considerable alarm among the South Persia Bifles Cavalry and the South Persia Bifle muleteers. One or two South Persia Bifle sow r ars in the middle of the camp, began firing up into the air in their excitement, until stopped by some Indian ranks of the Burma Mounted Bifles. Several South Persia Bifle horses47 broke loose. Several South Persia Rifle mules and South Persia Rifle muleteers fled across the camp from north to south, mainly in alarm at the noise of the Lewis Gun. All were stopped at various points of the perimeter, and the camp was soon perfectly quiet again Our casualties in this night attack were one Indian officer, Burma Mounted Rifles, killed (shot through the head), one sowar, South Persia Rifle Cavalry, mortally wounded. One pony, Burma Mounted Rifles, and one horse, South Persia Rifle Cavalry were severely wounded and both had to be destroyed at dawn. 8 . Troops stood to am s at 4 a.m. just before dawn. At 4-20 a.m. it was sufficiently light to see that Chinar Rahdar fort was about S00 yards off but unoccupied. The spur of hills north of the fort w r as about 800 or 900 yards off. The nearest low hills south of the fort were about 1.000 yards off, and the main crest of the “ Baluchi ” ridge was 3,400 yards off. The enemy were seen in the hills both north and south of the fort. The eamo offered a good target to enemy snipers. The four gurs v ere allotted a position on the south side of the camp outside the perimeter, and the Battery mules w T ere moved back about 400 yards east of the camp. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke was allotted the ridge called “ Baluchi Bidge,” as the objective of attack for his battalion. 9. At dawn, it was possible to read tw'o letters, written at Shiraz at 9-15 p.m. and 11-30 p.m., respectively, by Captain A. J. Christian, General Staff, and w T hich reached me in the peiimeter camp about 1 a.m When these were received in camp in the dark I understood they were letters in Persian intercepted from a qasid of the enemy. These letters when read at dawn shewed that our Persian allies had been delayed in starting from Shiraz, and that some of our allies intended to climb on to the main mountain ran^e not far from our left flank. It was all-important that our Persian allies should get a good start towards Siakh, so I resolved to delay a decisive attack for an hour or twn if possible. 10. At 4-40 am. the enemy began to snipe the camp and within a few minutes the enemy’s fire became hot, and casualties began to occur. There wnre some signs of panic among,the Persian muleteers and followers, but nothing serious. The cart drivers shewed signs of going off towards Shiraz, but Captain Gray, South Persia Rifles, wath his revolver persuaded them to remain w here they were. The 16th Rajputs had one man kiffed and one severely wounded, both by the same bullet, and one syce was wmunded. I ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Grant to start-off the attack of the 3*124th Baluchistan Infantry under Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, supported by the guns, while I detailed some Burma Mounted Rifles to attack the low hills north of Chinar Rahdar fort. Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke’s attack started at 5 a.m. The Baluch Company (Captain Gardner) and a Punjabi Company (Captain Wetherall) were in fiont, and the other two companies in support. I ordered Major Chapman to send one squadron, Burma Mounted Rifles, at once to capture Kuh-i-Barfi spur, with another squadron and a troop of South Persia Rifles Cavalry in support. The attack started at 5-5 a.m. and Captain Thacker’s squadron had seized the spur at 5-15 a.m. driving off about 40 or 50 enemy who retired westwards to the next ridge. The Burma Mounted Rifles had one pony wounded. The South Persia Rifles dashed out at full gallop, and prolonged the firing line on the right on the spur. The enemy wns quickly driven-off the next successive ridge by rifle fire, and retired towards the south-west out of range. Meanwhile Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke’s infantry attack made rapid progress. The enemy originally numbered about 150 men on c&lt; Baluchi Ridge and was reinforced, as was subsequently ascertained, by 450 mounted men from Ak Chasmeh, with orders to check the Indian Column while Saulat packed and bolted. The fire of the enemy w r as heavy, and every ridge and sangar w r as littered with Mauser cases and clips.48 In previous flrAts the Qashqais have exposed themselves fearlessly, both mouuted^and on foot, and hence suffered heavy casualties. In this fight they were careful to take co\er. # Snrmorted by the fire of four guns, and with occasional bursts from their own Lewis Guns Jnd Maxims, the b-124th Baluchistan Infantry earned the river bed the White Knoll and the successive and rising spurs without a halt or check and reached the summit of “ Baluchi Kidge ” at 5-2o a m s distance of 3 400 yards, in 25 minutes. A dashing and well carried out attack Our losses in this attack were one killed and 12 wounded, mostly among the Baluc 11 Company, which is composed mostly of young soldiers. 11 The bulk of Saulat’s fighting men had thus been drawn into a fight near Chinnr Rahdar They were already defeated, and had expended much ammunition against us. Some hundreds of our Arab and Qashqai allies were Mw gcttru? on to the main mountain ridn-e on our left flank, and 1 wished to let them join in the Sand pursuit and so be committed to a blood feud agains the Saulat and on our si P de Our allies indulged iu some long range firing, and it was obvious that Saulat’s men would soon flee. There was, therefore, no good obiect in pressing on our attack too rapidly. ^ Af6-25 am. I sent forward one section of guns with an escort of one platoon Rajputs to reinforce Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke. I directed Major Chapman to take forward his 3rd B g u ™^ *th ,?*r on Kuh-i-Barfi spur. 12 4.s soon as Maior Chapman had moved up, T sent forward a garnson earmarked to occupy Chinar Eahdar fort, consisting oi one Indian officer “5 men 3 124t P h Baluchistan Infantry, and one troop South Persia Rifles Cavalry. This was quickly effected. The wounded were then evacuated into the fort and placed in c arge of certain medical personnel detailed by the S. M. 0., Captain Porter The three fourgom of bhoosa were left on the road at the gate of the fort, and the horses were unharnessed and put inside the toit. ^ 13 After settliug these details, I ordered the remaining section of guns The S^Iw U 6 t^ e L;e“-« Holbrooke fired one or two rounds with his guns against the rapidly retreating enemy, and occupied th6 “AtVit 6 ’ ' Cuchitilge ” 'i sTnt a message to Major Chapman directing him to call up Ms squadron left ^ob-vatmn on Koh^pja BaluohisMrinfantr'y! with the three squadrons, Burmah Mounted Rifles, and 8 outh Persia Rifles Cavalry. The Baluchis and Burma Mounted Rifles advanced without meeting any rto tinn The only incident was the capture and disarming of t re , being made happy with plenty of food and water. At 9-30 A M. the Baluchis went into bivouac at Ak Chasmeh. I sent forward the wing, 16th Rajputs, and the two Mofnte&amp;s^had had^a gallant fight on 25th May. * I detailed Lieutenant-Colonel Grant to accompany this force.I myself with Major Hobson rode down into the valley, picked up the Burmah Mounted Bides near Ak Chasmeh, and advanced southwards about two miles to the Gardan-i-Sagavi, whence there is a good view as far as the Siakh group of villages. There was neither sound nor sign of the enemy. A friendly tufanghchi reported that some of Sardar Ektesham’s men had fired on the escort of the Saulat during their flight and caused one or two casualties and expedited their movements. At Ak Chasmeh, Saulat had abandoned considerable supplies of barley and bhoosa, from which the Burma Mounted Bifles had filled up their nosebags. The remainder was utilized by Qavvam’s mounted men. It w r as ascertained subsequently that the Sardar Ektesham’s men, near Dorinjun, had intercepted some fleeing Qashqais, killing tw r o and wounding three, but Sardar Ektesham’s main force was undoubtedly too late in reach ing its appointed place at Siakh. The Sardar Ektesham is organizing his tribal force at Siakh, and has two old South Persia Bifles Austrian guns and tw r o South Persia Bifles Maxims, under Yavar Muhammad Taghi Arab, South Persia Bifles to pursue the Saulat towards Eiruzabad. 14. It was now very hot and the troops were getting tired. At 10-45 a.m. I issued orders for the column to go into bivouac at the upper spring of Ak Chasmeh. The Bajputs and the Mountain Battery were the last to reach Ak Chasmeh, at 12-30-p.m., having marched and worked well in the hills on a praticularly hot day. After a good rest, the column started from Ak Chasmeh at 4-15-p.m. and the rear guard arrived at Shiraz at 8-30-p.m. (15 miles). 15. The casualties inflicted on the enemy by the column are estimated at 8 killed and 20 wounded. Our casualties were Indian ranks, three killed and fifteen wounded, and South Persia Bifles Cavalry one killed. E. F. OBTON, Colonel, Deputy Inspector- General t South Persia Rifles. Shiraz :i L 50 Report of Officer Commanding, 3=124th Baluchistan Infantry on operations on 7th=8th July 1918. (Sketches I and V). The force left Shiraz about 6 p.m., on 7th July 1918, the battalion being with the main body. Just as it was getting dark and when near the Bagh-f- Janat I received orders to reinforce the advance guard -with two companies, as they were being opposed. A few bullets passed over us as we marched along, but no one was hit. On joining Colonel Vanrenen some two miles beyond Bagh-i-Janat, he told me the enemy had all gone and that -we were near the camping ground. Shortly afterwards Colonel Orton came up and the camp was laid out. The battalion occupied the west side and half of the north and south sides of the perimeter. About 2-30 a.m., the north side of the camp was fired into by some 20 or 30 of the enemy, the range being some 300 yards. Bogs had been barking a lot, which evidently had made some of the men suspicious, and the ground being very hard it prevented many from sleeping, There was therefore no surprise at ail, and almost simultaneous with the first shot fired by the enemy a Lewis gun of B Company started firing. After a minute or two’s firing the enemy fled. There were no casualties in the battalion, but I believe there were a few in the camp. At 4-40 a.m., 8 th July 1918, I received orders to attack a ridge of hills some two milts distant. The battalion as described above was facing three different directions. A company was facing north. B and C Companies -west and B Company south, and the men were still lying down lining the perimeter. I had just explained my plan to the Company Commanders when a fairly heavy and accurate rifle fire was opened on the camp. Company Commanders bad some difficulty under the circumstances in explaining the idea to the men, and still more in getting the men away from these positions into the attack formation. I consider the way Company Commanders disentangled their men from the camp and dashed off to the attack without even “forming up” and with out any delay at all was a good piece of w T ork. C Company (Captain Gardner) and B Company (Captain Wetherall) w r ere in the front line. A Company (Captain Gregory) and B. Company (Major Stewart, M.C). in reserve. C on the the right, B. on the left. The objective I gave was a sugar loaf hill, on the southern corner of which the left of C Company was directed. The men moved with fine elan and dash, and in 25 minutes from the start they had gained all objectives. The enemy’s loss is unknown, mine was one killed and 12 wounded ; three of the latter very seriously. Several rifles w r ere hit in the men’s hands, and other men w r ere hit by stones or had bullets through their clothing, etc. The enemy’s fire was quite heavy and I attribute our small losses to the rapid advance of C and B Companies. The former is quite a new company of Baluchis from the Bera Ghazi Bistrict, the oldest soldiers having only 8 months’ service. Its conduct was quite admirable. Having taken the ridge and the enemy having been driven aw T ay, they occupied another series of hills 1,1)00 yards off. A frontal attack on these would have meant more losses. I sent a message to Officer Command ing Column suggesting a turning movement via high hill on our left. Shortly afterwards our allies appeared in that part of the field and at 7 a.m., the enemy retired everywhere. About 7-30 I received orders to advance again. No enemy w r ere seen anywhere, and after some 3 or 4 miles the battalion halted at a spring of water, the wffiole force retiring to Shiraz in the evening. 175 c G ' B. F. B.

S,/ 55 Operations of the Niriz Column (Lieutenant-Colonel G. P. Grant, D.S.O.) against Chah Haqis, Labu Muhammadi Arabs and Charrahis. The concentration of troops to form the column under my command at Niriz commenced with the despatch of :— 2 Squadrons, Burma Mounted Bifles (Major H. It Dyer). Bombing and Demolition Sections with all mule transport, from Shiraz on 3rd May 1918. Colonel E. F. Orton, Deputy Inspector General, South Persia Bifles, reached Niriz the same day (3rd May) and began organizing the column from units which had recently arrived at Niriz from Saidabad and Bandar Abbas. These were:— 1 Section, 33rd (Beserve) Battery, Indian Mountain Artillery. (Cap tain C. B. Willis). 2 Companies, 3-121th Baluchistan Infantry. A Supply Section was also organized. I arrived at Niriz on 6 th May, and the following day Major H. B Dyer arrived with the troops from Shiraz, by this time Colonel E. E. Orton had completed all arrangements, and orders were issued for the march of the column, then concentrated at Niriz, at 1-30 a.m. on the morning of the 8 th May for Hassanabad. Leaving Niriz, at 1-30 a.m , the column, consisting of :— 2 Squadrons, Burma Mounted Bifles (Major H. B. Dyer). 1 Section, 33rd (Beserve) Battery, Indian Mountain Artillery (Captain C. B Willis). 2 Companies, 3-121th Baluchistan Infantry (Major A. S. Stewart, M. C.). Bombing and Demolition Sections (Major J. Masters, 16th Bajputs.) Supply Column. Crossed the Niriz Kutal, a rise of 1,500 feet, and reached Hassanabad, 13 miles, at 9-30 a.m. This point had been selected as a final concentration centre for my column. Here were already camped :— 1 Squadron, 15th Lancers (Major S. M Bruce). 1 Section, Indian Eield Ambulance (Captain B. B. Porter ). Supply Detail (Captain W. P. Hales.) Persian (Civilian) Demolition Section (from Niriz) (Subadar-Major Ali Dost). Orders were issued confidentially for the march of the combined column to Chah Haq at 1-30 p m. The morning was spent in redistributing transport, and organizing the supply columns. After a rest of three hours, the column marched for Chah Haq, 38J miles, at 1-30 p.m. Colonel Orton had previously arranged with me that the departure of the column from Hassanabad should be timed to take place simultaneously with the arrest by him of certain bad characters at Niriz These included Hashim Khan, Kalantar of Chah Haq, and Haji Baba of Herat-(Kharah)-i-Khurreh. The hour fixed was 2-30 p.m. Unfortunately news reached me that Haji Baba had fled from Niriz the night before at 7 p m, and was well on his way to Chah Haq, where he would assuredly raise the alarm. I accordingly marched from Hassanabad earlier than I had intended, determined, if possible, to reach Chah Haq before Haji Baba. The mounted troops received orders to push through without halting for the night, while the infantry and guns, under Major Stewart, M.C. were to rest for a few hours during the night at Duvun, and were to reach Chah Haq the following morn ing, 9th May. The mounted troops, consisting of 1 Squadron, 15th Lancers, and 2 Squad rons, Burma Mounted Bifles, pushed right through from Hassanabad to Chah56 Haq, halting only for j hour at Duvun to water arid feed. The track was an easy one, and only one low watershed had to he crossed. At Duvun it was discovered that Haji Baba had already passed on his way to Chah Haq. He had used the Niriz-Mashgun route, which joins our track at Duvun. Action to Chah Haq. The mounted troops reached Chah Haq a group of three forts at 9-30 p.m. and at once surrounded the forts with a cordon of picquets. The night was bitterly cold, and the men had only jerseys in place of greatcoats. The same night some shots were fired on our picquets, a few prisoners were taken, and some riflemen, attempting to break through the cordon were bayonetted by our mounted troops. 9th May 1918 .—At 4-30 a.m. the mounted troops stood to arms. The eastern forts, the residence of Hashin Khan and Haji Mullah Baba Beg, both noted brigands, were occupied, without resistance. Haji Baba had arrived a few hours before the mounted troops and had spread the alarm. These two forts were then evacuated by their normal garrison, who were alarmed at the approach of our guns. The western fort was still occupied by 30 riflemen. As these refused to surrender, orders were given to open fire on the fort. At 6-30 a.m. two Lewis guns were brought up by th£ Burma Mounted Eifles under Major Dyer, to within 150 yards of the western gate, and fire was concentrated on the loopholes in the towers flanking the gateway. At 7 a.m. the enemy opened the gate and attempted to escape, but were driven back by Lewis gun and rifle fire, one of the enemy being killed outside the gate. A section of the Burma Mounted Bifles then reached the gate and occupied the gateway, the enemy taking refuge in the lower tower and inner rooms of the fort. The Lewis guns were now placed in the central tower over the gateway, from which the interior of the fort could be commanded. A summons to surrender, con veyed by Subadar-Major Ali Dost to the garrison, was followed by the garrison issuing from tow r ers and inner rooms and giving themselves up. A house to house search produced a few hidden rifles (5) and certain Government property, including greatcoats, 303 service pattern puilthroughs, putties, and comforts for troops. It appears that some of the garrison with the bulk of the arms and ammunition had escaped by a secret passage connecting the interior of the fort with a covered “ qanat ” or water channel. The enemy lost Skilled and 1 wounded and 27 prisoners. We had no casualties. Meanwhile the remainder of the column, consisting of the infantry, guns, and transport, after resting a few hours at Duvun. had continued its march, reaching Chah Haq about midday. They had covered 51£ miles in 31 hours, A few of the young reinforcements from India with the 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry were the only men to fall out on this trying march. The three forts wmre completely demolished the following day by the Persian demolition section under Lance-Naik Kalbi Reza, 106th Hazara Pioneers. Unfortunately both this man and a Persian labourer were buried by the collapse of a brick wall, the Persian being killed and Lance-Naik Kalbi Reza receiving serious, and probably permanent, injuries to his spine. Intelligence agents came in this evening from Herat-i-Khurreh with information that Haji Baba and the Labu Muhammadi had already commenced evacuating their forts at Herat-i-Kurreh in anticipation of a visit from the column and had moved much of their property into the difficult, mountainous country bordering the Herat-i-Khurreh plain, to the west. A large camp of Labu Muhammadi Arabs was reported at Buru-Herat. It was evident that the news had reached the Labu Muhammadi of the column's approach, and that this Arab tribe was now thoroughly alarmed, expecting the column to march direct on Herat-i-Khurreh, their headquarters. 1 decided (a) to move myself, with the Burma Mounted Rifles on Bum, and {b) to send the remainder of the column, under Major S. M. Bruce to Herat-i-Khurreh direct. That officer had paid this place, Herat-i-Khurreh* 57 a previous visit last October, during Lieutenant-Colonel Orton’s operations, and was well acquainted with the situation of the forts to be attacked and destroyed and with local politics. Major Bruce’s instructions (appended) were (a) to march from Chah Haq on the night of IGth-llth May so as to reach Herat by 4 a.m. on the 11th. (b) to surround the two forts of Amir Quli Khan, Labu Muhammadi, lying to the north of the town, to attack, and destroy them, (c) to remain on friendly terms with Amir Quli Khan’s rival, Najaf Quli Khan, Tajik, and his represen tative, Muhammadi Hadi Khan, Kais-i-Herat. The latter had written to me at Chah Haq, promising assistance, and I had replied directing him to have supplies ready for the column, (b) to arrange lielio communication with the Burma Mounted Rifles on the 10 th and 11 th Mav. / BSC. 0, S.4» i 58 Operations against Labu Muhammadi Arabs and Charrahis. Actions of Chinar-i-Naz. (See Sketch A.) The Burma Mounted Rifles left Chah Haq soon after midnisrht 9th-l0th May. There was some little delay at the start owing to the mules for 2 Lewis guns, 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry, temporarily attached to Burma Mounted Rifles, not arriving at the rendezvous. Captain Murray, Burma Mounted Rifles, was sent back to bring these mules on with the transport column, escorted by 1 Troop, Burma Mounted Rifles. These 2 Lewis guns shortly afterwards joined Major Dyer, but the baggage and its escort of 1 troop under Captain Murray, missed the track to Burn in the dark, and eventually made their way to Herat-i- Khurreh. The track to Buru lay over low, undulating hills as far as the Khunsar river—a strong flowing stream, 40' wide and 1 J' deep on this date. It was noticed that the Degree Sheet 17-K gives quite a false impression of the topo graphy. The pronounced ridge shown on I he map bet ween Chah Haq and the Khunsar river does not exist. The watershed is composed of a low, undulating range, which could be traversed without difficulty by a motor car. After crossing the Khunsar river the Burma Mounted Rifles headed north east, straight for the Buru-i-Herat gap. The going was good, up a broad and gently sloping valley covered with low scrub, and bounded by high, precipitous hills. Our guide, who had himself seen the Labu Muhammadi encampment at Buru-i-Herat only two days before, described Buru as consisring of a small mud fort and some cultivation, immediately we4 of a deep gorge in the hills. It was certain that all approaches from the direction of Chah Haq and Herat-i- Khurreh would be watched by outposts of the tribesmen. The Burma Mounted Rifles were therefore directed to make a detour to the west, so as to enter the Buru Valley from the north-west several intervening spurs had to be crossed in this manoeuvre. The Labu Muhammadi Camp was sighted about 890 yards off, at the point described by our guide, but it was evident from the small number of tents and animals that the bulk of the tribe had already moved off. As women could be seen in camp, orders were given merely to surround the camp and disarm the men, but not to open fire. The Burma Mounted Rifles rounded up and disarmed a few Arabs fleeing to the hills, and then watered and fed their ponies, while I made enquiries as to the whereabouts of the main Labu Muhammadi Camp. Strictest discipline was maintained by the Burma Mounted Rifles and although valuable property was lying about the camp, it is greatly to the credit of this unit that nothing was touched. Among the women was the sister of Amir Quli Khan, Saham Ashair, Chief of the Labu Mnhammadi. She claimed to be the wife of Mirza Ali, who had rendered some assistance to the column under Lieutenant-Colonel Orton, last October. This statement was corroborated by Subadar-Major Ali Dost, my Intelligence Officer. At her request, I gave this lady a written guarantee that her camp at Buru would not be attacked or looted by any troops belonging to my column. Meanwhile valuable information had been put together. Erom this it appeared that (a) these Labu Muhammadi were only awaiting the return of camels from their main camps at Chinar-i-Naz and Kur Kbungan to remove the rest of their property from Buru-i-Herat, (b) a large band of Charrahis, returning from the Yazd Road, was near Chinar-i-Naz. The information appeared to be reliable, and I accordingly determined to follow up the Labu Muhammadi and Charrahi bands towards Chinari-i-Naz.59 A guide was obtained from tbe Labu Muhammadi Camp at Bum to lead tbe Burma Mounted Bdfles to Chinar-i-Naz. He was warned that in tbe event of treachery he would be instantly shot. At 10-45 a.m., the Burma Mounted Bifles scouts reported an Arab en campment in the low hills 2 miles south-west of Chinar-i-Tsaz. Clouds of dust, denoting flocks and herds in rapid movement, were aiso seen 2 miles further along the road leading to Kur Khungan (Kar Khangu on degree sheet), a Labu Muhammadi settlement belonging to Mir Mehdi Quli Khan, a cousin and rival, of Amir Quli Khan, “ Saham Ashair.” Major Dyer, with 5 troops and 4 Lewis guns, immediately turned off south west, in the direction of the Arab encampment, leaving 2 troops with Captain Thacker at (1). Here I received a deputation of villagers from Chinar-i-Naz. They came out with a vhite flag and Korans and were evidently afraid that I intended to punish Chinar-i-Naz. Great was their relief w'ben I explained that ~ w'e were in pursuit of robbers, and did not punish Tajik villagers. They eagerly pointed out the direction of Cbarrahis Camp—about 3 miles beyond the village of Chinar-i-Naz—and estimated their numbers at 300 rifleman, of whom some 30 were mounted. Captain Thacker was directed to push on and engage these Charrahis, wLo shortly afterwards opened fire on our scouts at a range of about 1,200 yards. The Burma Mounted Bifles were now separated in 2 distinct groups, some 3 miles apart, with a mass of difficult, mountainous country interven ing. Meanwdiile Major Dyer had been fired on by the Labu Muhammadi near their camp, marked (2). The Burma Mounted Bifles scouts, mounted, and with bayonets fixed, charged the enemy with effect, bayonetting half a dozen of them. The enemy was driven from his camp up the slopes of the high hills to the w r est of their camp by 2 troops. One troop collected camels, loot, etc., wdiile 2 troops were held in reserve. By 2 p.m., the enemy had retired westward in the direction of the Charrahi valley, pursued for some distance by the Burma Mounted Bifles. To return to Captain Thacker’s action on the right, 1 troop had occupied a covering fire position along spur (3), and was engaged in a long range fire fight with the enemy, who w r ere gradually driving their animals and property over the ridge towards Murosku. Half a troop sent to turn the enemy’s right was held up at (4), and at this time it looked as if the enemy would succeed in removing his animals and pro perty before reinforcements could arrive from Major Dyer’s troops. I therefore ordered Captain Thacker to send a troop round the enemy’s right flank to seize the top of the ridge south of his position, to menace his rear, and to force the enemy to abandon his animals in order to secure his retreat. Bisaldar Barman Ali, though heavily fired on wdien crossing the valley (5), led his troop at a gallop to spur ( 6 ) up which he rapidly worked his way, drawing upon his troop much of the enemy’s fire. At the same time I sent gallopers to inform Major Dyer of the situation, and to obtain reinforcements from him. Owing to the mountainous character of the intervening country, touch had been lost with headquarters Burma Mounted Bifles. Had a signalling post been established at (7), communication might possibly have been maintained. Meanwhile Captain Thacker had pushed J a troop to ( 8 ) to prevent the enemy driving off his animals in the direction of Murusko. The Charrahis had apparently succeeded in loading up and removing a small portion of their animals when they first saw the dust of the Burma Mounted Bifles column approaching about 10 a.m. that morning. At 2-15 p.m , Major Dyer arrived with 2 troops and 2 Lewis guns, and moved rapidly up the long spur. The Charrahis had by this time been forced to abandon the bulk of their animals and loot, and were retiring in small groups on a front of 2 miles in a general north-westerly direction, towards am 60 pass (9; leading to the Charrah plain. At this pass a final stand was made by the enemy, who also held the precipitous hills flanking the “ nek.” I ordered Major Dyer to take this “ nek” and to complete our success. He personally led the attack on this position with 2 troops, supported by 2 Lewis guns. The Burma Mounted Bifleshad now been marching and fighting for 16 hours, and this gallant attack, carried out by tired men and horses, is deserving of highest praise. To release rifles and thus obtain sufficient fire power in the final attack, ponies were left in a “ mob ” under cover, in charge of three non- combatants. The two troops attacked across a series of thickly wooded ridges, where the enemy had the advantage of good cover. The Burma Mountain Bifles now w ithdrew and reached Chinar-i-Naz, with the animals and booty captured from the Charrahis, about 7 P.M. They had been 19 hours on the move. The total distance covered by the column this day was 50 miles. We bivouacked for the night | mile above the village, among fine walnut trees. Enemy's strength in the two separate engagements this day was esti mated to be :— South of Chinar-i-Naz —150 rifles Labu Muhammadi Arabs and a few Charrahis, many mounted, under Abdul Hussain Khan, son of the Chief, Saham Ashair Labu Muhammadi. TFest of Chinar-i-Naz —200 rifles (Charrahis) including 50 mounted men. These Charrahis belonged to the Hashimi section and were led by Mulla Faraj. They were returning with loot taken from caravans on the Yezd road, where they had been operating in partnership with Saham Ashair’s Labu Muhammadi Arabs. The local villagers complained to me bitterly of the depredations of these gangs which w r ere now too strong for the “ Tajik ” peasant proprietor.', to oppose Saham Ashair had forcibly seized one- half of the property at Chinar-i-Naz, formerly a prosperous village of 60 houses. Enemy casualties —30 killed, 36 wounded. Our casualties —Wounded :— No. 201 Signaller Boda Singh. ' No. 98 Acting Lance-Daffadar Kirpal Singh. Booty captured —143 camels, many loaded with stolen property. 370 sheep, 4 cows. 8 donkevs. * 3 horses and 2 foals. 10 rifles, including 2 Lee Metford, British pattern, long rifles. Two cases of correspondence belonging to Saham Ashair were also captured. From this, ample documentary proof exists of this famous brigand’s partici pation in organized brigandage. His wife sent in the same evening to say she was quite destitute, and with out food and bedding, I sent her, as a present, 3 tumans, some quilts, cooking pots, and food. Action at Gudar-i-Eir Zad pass, north-west of Berat-i-Khurreh. (Sketch B.) 11th May 1918. —It was probable that the enemy, smarting from his losses, and taunted by his women, would endeavour to recapture his property on the march of the column to Herat-i-Khurreh. To baffle the enemy and upset his plans, I selected the little known Gudar-i-'Pir Zad pass in preference to the better known, and more direct, route via Buru-i-Herat, which the enemy would probably expect the column to follow. The track crossing the Gudar-i-Pir Zad branches off eastward across the range, some 4 miles short of Buru-i-Herat.Major Dyer disposed his 7 troops as follows Hear guard and baggage guard —2 troops and 2 Lewis guns. Advanced guard and main body —5 troops and 2 Lewis guns. The advanced guard and main body had successfully passed through the Pir Zad pass when a report came in from the right flank patrol at i p.m. that it had been fired on from the hills between Herat-i-Khurreh and Buru-i-Herat. This point was about 7 miles north-west of Herat-i-Khurreh. Major Dyer at once wheeled his 5 troops to the right, and galloped to the foot of the high hills. Here the Burma Mounted Rifles came under heavy fire. Major Dyer covered the advance of 4 troops with the fire of one troop, dismounted at (2). One troop protected the left flank about (3) ; the remain ing 3 troops pushed up the rocky Tangi (4), under covering fire of 2 Lewis guns, which kept down the enemy’s fire. The summit of the rocky ridge w r aa reached about 5-15 p.m. One troop was sent south to drive the enemy from (5), the remaining 2 troops worked north along the parallel lidges, (G) and ( 7 )^ driving the enemy before them. Meanw r hile a heavy cross fire was maintained by the troop dismounted at ( 2 ). The enemy fought obstinately, and disputed every yard of the main ridge. He was assisted by several of his women, who brought up ammunition, and were clearly seen loading rifles and encouraging the riflemen. Among these women were recognized Saham Ashair’s sister and others whose camp and pro perty I had spared at Buru-i-Herat the day before. The enemy w 7 as thus being gradually pressed back along the top of the parallel ridges ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) to ( 8 ), where many were shot and bayonetted about 6-30 p.m. The dismounted troop at (2) co-operated by moving north-west along the foot of the steep crags, in this way pinning the enemy to the top of the ridge. Meanwhile the rear guard, encumbered by baggage animals and livestock, had reached the Pir Zad pass. At 4-15 p.m., realizing the danger to the rear guard, I had sent Subadar-Major Ali Dost, my Intelligence Officer, back from ( 2 ) with all speed to warn the rear guard, under Jemadar Harnam Singh. Subadar-Major Ali Dost placed 2 strong picquets at (9) and ( 10 ) with 2 Lewis guns, and supervised the passage of the rear guard through the pass. An attempt was made by the enemy to cut off the rear guard animals at this pass, but fire from the picquets, judiciously placed, combined with bursts of fire from the 2 Lewis guns, kept the enemy off, and enabled the baggage and live stock to get through without loss. I consider that Subadar-Major Ali Dost’s action extricated the rear guard from what might have been a dangerous position. 'fr The action ended at 7 p,m. The rear guard was reinforced by a third troop, the Burma Mounted Rifles reaching the perimeter camp of the main column at Herat-i-Khurreh at 9 p.m. Enemy's strength —150 to 200. Enemy's casualties —67 killed and 40 wounded. Booty —5 camels and 800 sheep. 5 modern rifles (Mausers) were also taken. Our casualties —No. 244 Signaller Gurbachan Singh. Killed. No. 163 Lance-Daffadar Gandha Singh. Wounded. The Burma Mounted Rifles had this day covered 33 miles. At Herat-i-Khurreh a messenger arrived from Mulla Abdulla Lashani, with letters expressing his friendship and offers of assistance. Subadar-Major Ali Dost received a letter from Sheikh Abdul Hassan of Kohistan, expressing friendly^ sentiments and anxiety lest the column should pay Kohistan a visit. 12th May 1918. Jlerat-i-Khurreh. —The column was again concentrated at Herat-i-Khurreh on the evening 11 th May. Major Bruce with the squadron Lancers, infantry, and the section artillery, had left Chah Haq at 1 a.m. on the 11th May, and had encountered no oppo sition either on the march or on reaching Herat-i-Khurreh, The large fort belonging to Haji Baba, situated on the northern outskirts of the town, was 175 C. G. S.62 found deserted. The fort was an exceptionally strong one, and took two days' continuous work to destroy. Haji Baba had given refuge in this fort to our enemy Obeidulla, Turkish Envoy, in the summer of 1917. Practically no supplies were^procurable locally at Herat-i-Khurreh. The inhabitants of this and the surrounding districts appeared to he half famished, and to be subsisting chiefly on roots and herbs. Last year’s harvest had failed. Fortunately the standing crops of barley and wheat were in the ear and were used as folder for animals. Operations in the Sarchahan valley, 13th May and 16th May 1918. (Sketch C and D.) Intelligence agents confirmed other information that Mulla Qurban, a notorious brigand, with a strong following, was near Ziarat, in the Sarchahan valley (Khunsar on degree sheet 17 -K). He had managed to evade Colonel Orton’s column last October, and would be certain to slip aw r ay into the mountains as soon as new's reached him that the column had left Herat-i-Khurreh. It was known that our movements were being watched by Tribal agents from Sarchahan. I decided to endeavour to surprise Mulla Qurban on the 13th May. Bogus orders were accordingly issued at 3 p.m. on the 12th May for the columns march northwards towards Marvas. Messengers had been sent ahead to inform Kalantars at Ariviian and Marvas of the approach of the column, and instructing these persons to lay out supplies for our troops. To conceal our rea 1 objective, guides were obtained from Hadi Khan, Kalantar of Herat-i-Khurreh, for the road to Marvas. 12th and 13th May .—The troops marched in the opposite direction under cover of night in 2 columns, the first consisting of infantry, guns, and baggage, under Major Stewart at 9 P M., and the second, consisting of the mounted troops, whom I accompanied, at 1-30 a.m., on 13th May. Intelligence agents sent ahead 24 hours before, met me on the road near Khunsar with the news that Khunsar w^as entirely deserted; that the Sarcha- hanis had driven their flocks into the mountains from fear of the possible approach of the column ; and that Mulla Qurban was still at Ziarat on the 11 tb May. The column concentrated at Khunsar at 7-3) a.m., 13th May. The mounted troops rested until 11-15 a.m., when they again pushed forward in the hope of surprising Mulla Qurbafi. at Ziarat. I accompanied the mounted troops, leaving Major Stewart M 0., in command of the remainder of the column resting in primeter camp at Kunsar. Helio communication w T as established with Major Stewart, who was warned to be ready to move m support to Ziarat at short notice. The Sarchahan villages were noticed to be all deserted until wdthin 4 miles of Ziarat, Between Babilun and Aliabad scouts reported armed men making off in the direction of Ziarat and the neighbouring hills. Villagers reported Mulla Qurban had not yet leit Ziaiat. p.p 5 p,M., keeping Major Bruce with me to act as Staff Officer, I sent Captain deBrath forward with 2 troops, 15th Lancers, to surround Ziarat village and forts, and to prevent the inmates escaping to the hills. Armed men could be seen running out of the village towards “ Gibraltar Hill ” and “ Ziarat Tangi ” and shots were fired on the Lancers. It became evident that Mulla Qurban intended to hold “ Gibraltar Hill ” and the pre cipitous ridge further west (“ West ridge ”), in order to cover the removal of his property and animals over the high hills into the Lashan valley. At 1-35 P M the remainder of the 15th Lancers, with 2 Hotchkiss guns, were sent to reinforce Captain deBrath, and Major Dyer with “ B ” squadron Burma Mounted Bifles, was directed to move round the eastern and northern end of “ Gibraltar Hill” and to cut off the enemy’s retreat. Major Dyer came under heavy fire from “ Gibraltar Hill ” and spurs further east at 2 p.m. ; at the63 same time a helio message was received from Captain de Brath that his advance through the “ deep gorge ” (Ziarat Tangi) was held up be some 50 of the enemy. I now realized that tbe enemy was in some force, and at 2 p.m signalled to Major Stewart, at Khunsar, to bring on the infantry and guns in support as early as possible. A reply was received from Major Stewart that a company 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry and the section Mountain Artillery would march for Ziarat at 3-30 p.m ; this was confirmed by a iater message to the effect that the remainder, with baggage, would follow at 4 p.m. It was now evident that no support, in the shape of guns and infantry would reach the mounted troops before nightfall. I decided, therefore, merely to clear the enemy from the hills overlooking the camping ground at Ziarat village, and to hold commanding points until permanent infantry picquets could be placed for the night. At 4-30 p.m wounded began to arrive at the dressing station. At the same time Captain de Brath reported the situation as it presented itself to him on the right, opposite Ziarat Tangi. Captain de Brath, realizing the danger of committing his 2 troops at Ziarat Tangi, where they had dismounted to cover the advance of his “point,*’ withdrew about 2-30 p'm., and occupied the high ground on both sides of the Tangi, led horses also being ■withdrawn to (X). On the arrival of the remainder of the squadron and the 2 Hotchkiss guns, about 3-15 p.m., 13 men with the Hotchkiss gurs were sent to reinforce the troop holding the crags overlooking, and to the north of. the Tangi. The remaining troop was directed up “ Gibraltar Hill ” to co-operate with 1 squadron, Burma Mounted Biffts, attacking the saddle from the opposite side (he., south) of “ Gibraltar Hill.” The enemy turned their fire on to the led horses at (X) but this was silenced by Hotchkiss guns from (Y). A further reinforcement of 1 troop, Burma Mounted Bifles (Bessaidar Naudha Singh), reached Captain de Brath -who, about this time, reported the enemy were attempting to break west. The troop worked its way f mile beyond the squadron, 15th Lancers, and seized, and continued to hold West Bidge till nightfall. Meanwhile “ B ” squadron, Burma Mounted Bifles, under Major Dyer, were heavily engaged on the far side (south) of “ Gibraltar Hill.” About 1-45 p.m. Major Dyer had sent two Indian officer’s patrols up the valley, 1 mile east of Ziarat; one worked across the slopes to the south and east of the deep, narrow 7 valley ; the other, on the opposite side of the valley, to the north and w 7 est. “ B ” squadron and 2 Lewis guns followed at a distance of 500 yards. The enemy held his fire, letting these officer’s patrols pass, but directly the squadron entered the gorge, a heavy fire was opened on it from the heights on both flanks. One troop, supported by a Lewis gun, was ordered to drive the enemy from the eastern heights while the other three troops of the squadron, supported by a Lewis gun, advanced up the western slopes oi “ Gibraltar Hill.” Major Dyer, realizing the importance of seizing the high col which con nected “ Gibraltar Hill ” with the snow clad Boshan Kuh, signalled for reinforcements. Two troops “ A ” squadron, Burma Mounted Bifles, under Captain Murray, were sent, and these advanced towards the col in extended order up the southern slopes beyond “ Gibraltar Hill,” supported by Lewis guns on his left flank. The attack w as pressed home, and the col successfully taken. Meanw r hile Captain Thacker, with three troops “B” squadron, Burma Mounted Bifles, had captured “ Gibraltar Hill,” and touch was now obtained with the left of Captain de Brath’s squadron. Major Dyer now advanced five troops, Burma Mounted Bifles, along the col connecting “ Gibraltar Hill ” with Boshan Kuh. They gradually worked south, driving the enemy, in a most gallant manner, up the rocky slopes as far as the snow-line. The enemy fought hard to save his animals and property, taking advantage of numerous caves from which, he fired on the Burma Moun ted Bifles.64 At 5-20 p.m. a message was sent to Major Dyer that the column would bivouac at Ziarat, and directing him to hold “ Signal Hill” (west end of Gibraltar Hill) with a Burma Mounted Rifle picquet until relieved by a permanent infantry picquet for the night. At 6-15 p.m a retirement was commenced from the snow-line to camp at Ziarat, and was followed up by the enemy. All wounded and killed were first evacuated by the Burma Mounted Rifles to Ziarat. Major Dyer was joined on Signal Hill by one troop, 15th Lancers, under an Indian officer; these he left as a picquet to be subsequently relieved by infantry. Camp was reached by the Burma Mounted Rifles at 8 p.m. At 8-30 p.m. Major Stewart with the infantry, guns and baggage, reached Ziarat. The night was dark, and the Khunsar river, which had to be forded, 1 mile from Ziarat, was in flood. The captured animals from Herat-i-Khurrch had, therefore, to be left on the far bank for the night, under protection of the rear guard. A strong defensive perimeter, consisting of stone walls, was occupied for the night. Permanent infantry picquets were placed on Signal Hill at the mouth of Ziarat Tangi, and in the towers of Ziarat village. The night passed quietly and there was no attempt on the pan of the enemy to attack. Enemy's strenyth .—Estimated 400 rifles. Enemy were armed with modem magazine rifles, chiefly Mausers. Enemy's /osm. —Estimated at 65 killed and 120 wounded. Our casalties .—Three killed and eight wounded, as follows:— Burma Mounted Rifles . One Indian Officer killed, eight men wounded (of whom two died next day). Two horses wounded. 15th Lancers . . . Two men wounded. One horse wounded. Two horses lost. Captures. Twelve rifles. Ziarat, the 14th May —Orders had been issued over night for parties to search the slopes of Roshan Kuh for abandoned aninals, rifles, etc. Two platoons of the Khattak’s (“A” company, 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry Captain Dobbs) were directed to move up the most eastern of the two tracks leading from Ziarat to K.h'W 3 ]a Jamali as it was considered probable that the enemy had driven off his animals by this, the easier of the two tracks leading over the snow-line, into the Lashani country, lying further south. A central signalling station was established on Signal Hill by 6 a.m. Erom here the guns opened fire at 7'30 a.m. on small groups of the enemy near the snow-line to the south-west at ranges between 1,500 yards and 3,700 yards. Search parties, covered by guns sweeping the crest, worked their way up to the extreme summit, and drove in many animals. A bombing party, under Major Masters, was directed to clear the caves, from which heavy fire had been opened by the enemy the previous afternoon, should these still be held by the enemy. Thanks to the effective artillery support by Captain Willis, the operation of searching the ground and bringing in the animals was carried out without loss. Enemy's strength.—On the distant crest were observed from 100 to 200 men. Enemy's casualties.—VrohMy 20 killed and wounded. Difficult to esti mate, as our fire was chiefly confined to shrapnel at long, or medium, range. Our casualties. —Nil.65 ♦ Captures. One horse, 15th Lancers re-captured. (Lost in action of previous day.) Six horses. One mule. Sixty-four donkeys. Eight cattle. Eive rifles. A second letter arrived from Mulla Abdulla of Lashan declaring his friend- sbip and expressing alarm at the presence of the column in the Sarchahan valley. I receive a deputation of local Saiyids and villagers, who came out under a flag of truce and bearing Korans. I assured them that their property and persons would be spared ; that the column was engaged in punishing the notorious robbers who infested this neighbourhood, I accordingly invited their cordial co-operation. They informed me that in the fight on 13th May, above Ziarat, Mulla Qurban was present with 100 picked men of his owm following, and with him were also 300 Gharra- his. Mulla Qurban himself w-as wmunded in the shoulder. I was further told that the main stronghold of the Charrahis was on the Kuh-i-Khan, about 12 miles to the west of Ziarat. _ This stronghold, they said, was considered by the Charrahis to bo impregnable. These had voluntarily left their forts with their animals and loot, and were prepared, if necessary, to fight my column on the Kuh-i-Khan. The same night I sent out spies to report whether there w r as any truth in the report, and decided to make a personal reconnaissance of the position in the morning. This night some firing took place on the picquets about Ziarat Tangi, which w as returned. Sketch E. Ziarat, loth The reconnaissance party consisted of Lieutenant- Colonel Grant, Major Bruce, Major Dyer, Subadar-Major Ali Dost, an Indian officer, Burma Mounted Itifles, and 6 sowars, and included signallers. The plan w r as to work unobserved, among the low hills to a point irom which it would be possible to look dowm on the position, said to be held by the Gharrahis. I con sidered that any larger escort w^ould have led to our detection by the enemy, whereas a party of a dozen mounted men w^ould be no unusual sight in this country, provided alw 7 ays they moved in irregular formation. About 11-30 a.m. a point was reached from which an excellent view w 7 as obtained of Tangi Zard and the enemy’s position at the foot of the Kuh-i-Khan. We remained in observation for an hour, and noted sangars and strong points which could be seen to be occupied by the enemy’s outposts. Blocks were visible on Green Spur ” and “ Green Plateau, ” and it appeared probable that the bulk of the Charrahis were hidden among the trees and dense undergrowth and rocks of the Tangi Zard. A sketch w T as made of the enemy’s position. This reconnaissance enabled the column commander to lay his plans for the next day. The reconnoitring patrol returned to Ziarat without incident about 4-30 p.m. By this evening the demolition of Ziarat Port and towers had been com pleted by the Persian demolition party under Sepoy Muhammad Hussain, 106th Hazara Pioneers. When the column arrived at Ziarat, fine barley crops, belonging to Mulla Qurban, were standing near the village. These crops were cut and used as forage for the animals. The column had had no issue of barley since the 11 th May at Herat-i-Khurreh. No barley w T as found locally. At 9 p.m. the spy returned with the information that Kuh-i-Kban was deserted by the Charrahis, and that he had seen no one at Tangi-Zard all day. Fortunately the personal reconnaissance on this day proved that the spy was iving. 175 C. G. S.66 Preliminary orders were issued at 5-30 p.m. for the column to march half a-n hour after midnight to Kuh-i-Khan. These orders were followed by Opera tion Order No. 6. I explained my plan of attack to unit commanders at 7-30 p.m. supplementing operation orders by an outline panorama of the Kuh-i- Khan position on this sketch the objectives of each unit were defined. My plan was, briefly, to move the mounted troops, unobserved, to positions from which they could pi event the enemy breaking away from the frontal infantry attack on Green spur. The Burma Mounted Bifles, working well from the east, were directed with their right on Green plateau; their Feft to extend to near Snowy peak. The Squadron 15th Lancers were to form the western “ stop,” in order to prevent the enemy from breaking out to the west and south-west. . * The troops were to be in position by 4-45 a.m,, the hour fixed for- launch ing the infantry attack against Green spur. Arrangements had been made to keep the plan to attack the Charrahis at Kuh-i-Khan a secret. Agents had given out in the villages near Ziarat that the column w T as marching back via Khunsar and Chah Haq ; arrangements were made for guides to accompany the column to Chah Haq by a short cut over the low hills bordering the Khunsar valley to the south-east. . 12-30 a.m. the column slipped quietly aw^ay in the opposite direction, on its way to Kuh-i-Khan, At 7 miles a halt was made at a spring of good water close to the track, and here all baggage and captured animals w T ere°left under the rear guard, consisting of unfit men of the Burma Mounted Bifles, Lancers and Baluchis, under Lieutenant Tearoe attached 3-124th Baluchis! The rear guard commander’s instructions were to park his convoy, and to remain at this spring until the course of the action at Kuh-i-Khan admitted of an advance of the baggage and rear guard. He would then join the column at the foot of the Kuh-i-Khan. It was 3-30 a.m. when the Burma Mounted Bifles left the column of route, branching off southwards across a well wooded valley at the foot of the high range, which culminates in the snowy peak of the Kuh-i-Khan fi0,700 feet). The Burma Mounted Bifles had thus hours to make their w r ay to the position indicated the day previous, to Major Dyer. At 4 A m. the Squadron 15th Lancers, under Major Bruce, trotted on to get into position, passing the mouth of the Tangi Zard while it was still dark. Their movement was apparently quite unobserved by the enemy. At 4-30 a.m. the head of the column was opposite the mouth of the Tangi Zard. The Wing, 3-124th Baluchis, w r ere formed up in open mass facing south, 1,600 yards from the mouth of the Tangi Zard, with the guns in action further back on the gently rising foot hills north of, and opposite to, the Kuh- i-Khan position. The Baluchis were ordered to take “ Green spur ” covered by fire of the 2 mountain guns. The Green spur ends abruptly in a 700 feet cliff, rising from the valley at an angle of 60°. This cliff, cleft in the centre by a nullah, ran along the entire base of Green spur, a distance of some 600 yards. To the west of Green spur w’as a minor spur, terminating in even steeper cliffs, and separa ted from Green spur by a deep chasm. To the east again of Green spur, slightly projecting beyond it, was “ Bastion Hill ”, a precipitous cliff, separated from Green spur by the Tangi Zard. The slopes of the hills were strewn with great boulders, partly covered by bushes. The Tangi Zard itself is walled in by precipitous cliffs, and is thickly wooded with a species of dwarf oak and wild olive. The position appeared a formidable one to take. Major Stewart, M.G, deployed his w T ing of the Baluchis for attack as follows : — Firing line and support-- 11 A ” company (Khattaks) in lines of sections, under Captain Dobbs. Reserve —“ B ” company (Punjabis) less 2 platoons, in line of platoons, under Major Stewart. (2 platoons remained as escort with the guns, and as a general reserve under the column commander.) *67 The 2 left platoons of “ A ” company were given as their objective, the left of the ridge, points (D) to (E). The 2 right platoons “ A ” company were given the right of the ridge points (E) to (F). The 2 maxim guns, under Eieufcenant Avent, were ordered to move on the right, and to assist the advance with covering fire. At 5 a.m. the wing moved forward in the above formation. Enemy riflemen were observed on the heights on both sides of the Tangi Zard and these opened fire on the advancing infantry. The 2 mountain guns now commenced shelling the ridge held by the enemy immediately above our infantry. The infantry, led by Captain Dobbs, pushed on rapidly through the densely wooded foot hills and were soon scrambling up the steep slopes leading to the ridge held by the enemy. The cliff, once reached, our infantry were defiladed from view of the enemy immediately above them, but a fairly heavy flanking fire was opened on them from “ Bastion Hill.” Major Stewart directed the fire of his Lewis guns and machine guns on to this hill, and soon silenced the enemy s fire foi the time being. Meanwhile the 2 mountain guns had been sweeping the crest above the infantrv at ranges of about 3,000 yards, and bad dropped several shells into Tangi Zard. They next turned their attention to “ Bastion Hill ” where enemy’s riflemen could be observed In 35 minutes the firing line hid captured the crest of the ridge at the north end of “ Green spur,” and any enemy remaining here were shot down. Some enemy had held on in a sangar (D), and had checked the advance of the left section for a short time, but the adjoining section, under Jemadar Amir Ali, worked round behind the sangar and got in with the bayonet, killing the occupants. The crest having been lost, the enemy made a rapid retreat up c£ Green Spur,” hotly pursued by Captain Dobb’s company 0 £ A”) with “B” company in echelon, to the rear, protecting the right flank. The guns increased their range and swept “ Green spur ” ahead of our infantry. It was now 6 a.m. The Burma Mounted Bifles’ Lewis guns could be heard at work on “ Green Plateau” and about “ Black Hill.” I decided to move the guns forward to a second position from which they could play a part in the final stages of the action, and in the pursuit. On reaching the foot of the cliffs, the officer commanding the section Mountain Artillery (Captain Willis) first reported that the cliff was every where too steep for his battery mules to negotiate. I entrusted the clearing of a rough path to Subadar Major Ali Dost, 106th Hazara Pioneers, who, with the aid of a platoon of “ B ” company, 3-124th Baluchis, made a rough track up the face of this cliff. With difficulty the mules scrambled to the top with their loads, and several fell in the effort. It was a fine performance, and one of which the section has reason to be proud. Accompanied by Captain Hales, Orderly Officer, I went forward to obtain touch with the infantry advance, and ascertained how matiers were progressing. Guns were now brought into action at (2). The squadron, 16th Lancers, on the right, and the Burma Mounted Bifles on the left, could be seen closing on Snowy 5 Peak, thus completing the cordon which was being steadily drawn round the Charrahis. By 8 a.m.j “ A ” company had reached the head of the deep nullah, or Tangi, known as Tangi Zard, 10,200 feet above sea level, and 2,900 feet above the point of deployment. One platoon of &lt;c B ” company pushed further to the west and reached the top of Kuh-i-Khan, 10,700 feet. “ A ” company worked its way eastward past “Snowy Peak” and joined hands with the Burma Mounted Bifles who were skillfully hidden from view just beyond the crest line. Parties of the enemy could be seen scrambling up the slopes from Tangi Zard in the hope of breaking through between Snowy Peak ” and “ Black Hill,” only to run into he arms of the Burma Mounted Bifles. Ihese parties would thenbreak back westward towards Kuh-i-Khan, where they would be blocked m turn by the 124th Baluchis. Thus, by 8 a.m., the converging movements of the 3 units, Squadron 15th Lancers on the right, Baluchis in the centre, and Burma Mounted Bifles on the left, had been completed, these 3 units reaching the snow-line almost at the same moment. The timing had worked out correctly. The cordon was now complete. Very few of the enemy escaped, and those still resisting were shot down or taken pnsoneis. Both the Burma Mounted Kifles and Baluchis used the bayonet freely. i -a i were issued to search the Zard Tangi and subsidiary nullas for ut den rifles and animals, and to withdraw to a rendezvous at the mouth of the Zard langi near which the dressing station had been formed. This withdrawal was skilfully carried out by unit commanders. This baggage and rear guard were ordered to close up to Zard Tangi from the spring near which they had remained since 2-30 a.m. ^ From enquiries and personal observation, I satisfied myself that there was insufficient water for my column to bivouac at, or near, Zard Tano-i The only water found was in a small well, about 1 mile east of Zard Tangi. • 1 4 0 rc i er ® 1 we 1 re accordingly given for the mounted troops to bivouac for the night at Chan Daraz, about 12 miles to the west of Tangi Zard, and for the remainder of the column to move on to 3 wells, reported about 4 miles further The mounted troops ^ reached Chah Daraz about 6 p m., only to find the Qanat was dry. Reconnaissances in every direction failed to find water. It was decided to push on the same night to Arzinjan, which was reported to be considerably nearer than would appear from the degree sheet. Horses and men had been 17 hours on the move, were exhausted, and were badly in need of water. Fortunately horses had been watered at the small 'well near Tan°d Zard at 2 p m. &amp; Ai zinjan uas not reached till 12-30 a.m., early on the morning of 17th May. The mounted troops had been on the move 24 hours, and had° covered a distance of some 52 miles. . T .h e mounted troops bivouacked on the western outskirts of the village of Aizinjan, near a Qauat ’ of good water. Here they were joined by the remainder of the column at 5 p m., on the 17th May. The Charrahi tribe is divided into 4 “ Taifas ” or sections ; of these, one, the Hashimi, Kalantar Agha Rahim, had been defeated at the action of Ohinar-i-Naz on 10th May 1918. The remaining sections were present at the action of Kuh-i-Khan, namely : — Section. 1. Mohd. Jani. 2 . Mir Shikari 3. Murtazai At the action of Kuh-i-Khan, about 400 rifles. Kalantars. Mohd. Kasim and Mohd. Karim. Mustafa Kuli. Abdul Karim. the enemy’s strength was estimated at Enemy s losses in this action are believed to have been very heavy. Reports subsequently received from villagers place them at over 250 killed and wounded. The Burma Mounted Rifles counted 36 dead bodies near “ Black Hill ” alone. Thirty prisoners were taken, including Abdul Karim of the Murtazai section, wounded in the face, and the brother of Mustafa Quli of the Mir Shikari section. Our casualties. 3-124th Baluchis, 3 wounded. The small casualty list I consider is due to the following factors :— ( 1 ) Completeness of surprise ; hence wild shooting by the enemy. ( 2 ) Rapidity of Khattack’s advance over what was considered to be impossible ground. (3) Close and effective artillery support.69 The heavy enemy casualty list was in a great measure due to Lewis and Hotchkiss gun fire, ’Enemy’s armament. —No black powder was used by the enemy in this action. He appeared to be armed wholly with modern small bore rifles, principally Mauser. Captures. —See appendix 4. 17th May 1918. —Meshedi Jani Khan, Chief of the Arab tribe of that name, which had been heavily punished by the Burma Mounted Bifles under. Major Dyer in January 1918, came in to see me. He was obviously perturbed at the presence of the column, but was soon reassured by me as to our intentions towards his tribe. He confessed that during his own absence last winter at Darab, his Arabs had been influenced and led astray by agitators. The ringleaders in the plot, according to him, were Mukhbir-es-Sultaneh and Baqr-es-Sultaneh in Tehran. The latter worked through his agent in Lashan, Bais Ahmad Khan, and through Bahim Agha, Kalantar of Abadeh Tasht in Lashan. According to Meshedi Jani Khan, this Bahim Agha has taken a very prominent part in this trouble. The Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs had been promised the loot of caravans passing along the Shiraz-Isfahan road. It was arranged that the Lashanis should help them, and they were told that a Bakhtiari Army was marching against the British who would shortly be driven out of Bars. 18th May 1918. —Accompanied by Major Bruce and a troop of cavalry, I rode to Saadatabad, where cars were in readiness to take us into Shiraz. 19th May 1918 to 23rd May 1918. —Shiraz was reached without incident about 1 p.m. The remainder of the column marched in two portions, (a) consisting of mounted troops under Major Dyer, and (b) infantry and guns, with all prisoners and captured animals, under Major A. E. Stewart, M.C. The first of these columns reached Shiraz on 21st May ; the second on 23rd May, without incident. Motor cars and carts were used to bring the wounded and sick in from Saadatabad. Summary of results attained by Expedition. 1. Three of the leading robber tribes had been severely punished, i.e, Chah Haqis, Labu Muhammadi Arabs, and Chehar Bahis. 2 . Friendly assurances had been received from the heads of the Kohistani, Lashani, and Meshedi Jani Khan Arabs; also from Najaf Quli Khan of Shahr-i-Babak and Herat-i-Khurreh. 3. Heavy losses had been inflicted (a total of some 272 killed and 362 wounded) with slight loss to ourselves (4 killed, 14 wounded, (2 died) and 2 injured). 4. A total of :— 61 rifles, 9 horses, 3 mules, 153 camels, 68 donkeys, 3,000 sheep and goats, had been taken from the enemy. 5. Six forts had been destroyed. 6 . A total distance of 421 miles was covered in 19 days, (Burma Mounted Bifles). I ascribe the results obtained chiefly to the following factors : — 1 . Bapidity of the column’s movements and long marches by night enabling the column to surprise the enemy. The column repeatedly outstripped news of its approach. 175 C. S. s.70 2 . Pitness and marching powers of all units forming the column. 3. Brilliant tactics of Burma Mounted Rifles in every action. 4. Accuracy of Intelligence. 5. Lewis guns. G. P.

Early history of the Sanlat-ud-Dauleh .—^Ismail Khan, Saulat-ud- Lauleh, is used about forty. As a younger brother of the Ilkhani he was very poor, but he soon shewed a distinct aptitude for tribal intrigue. His rise will be given in detail in a report on the Qashqais under preparation. Here it suffices to state that he was supported by the British, who once allowed him to tale hast at the Consulate. He was also on friendly social terms with the British at Shiraz, who visited him and went out shooting with him. He has shewn more than the average treachery in his career, and is avaricious, mean, and cruel; but, as a nomad chief, his energy and capacity are indisputable. In course of time he established a complete ascendency over the people of Ears who regarded him as invincible and dared not oppose him. 2. Visit of the Saulat-ud-Eauleh to the Ear man Farma at Kumishah .—• His Highness the Earman Earma, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Gough left Isfahan at the beginning of September 1916 for Shiraz. At Kumishah (he Saulat- ud-Hauleh visited the Earman Earma and demanded his investiture as Ilkhani. The Earman Earma expected to be given 50,000 tumans as the customary fee and. as this w r as not forthcoming, he agreed with the views telegraphed by the Sirdar Mutazid his acting Governor, from Shiraz, and decided to defer the grant of the document until his arrival there, hoping by this means to ‘'squeeze” the desired amount. The Saulat, who had reasons, dating from the previous tenure of the post by His Highness, to fear the Earman Earma, and who alleged that he was slighted, by His Highness giving a seat on a chair to the consulate Munshihashi while he (Saulat) was sitting on the ground, suddenly left the camp and rode off to Shiraz. 3. Opposition of Saulat-ud-Dauleh and Qavam-ul-Mulk to the Farman Farma .—The Saulat, upon reaching Shiraz, joined the Qavam-ul-Mulk and others to form an opposition to the appointment of the Earman Earma, on the grounds of his alleged excessive avarice. It is probable that at the back of this alliance w r as the knowledge that the Earman Earma’s governorship would mean the arrival of the British Column then at Isfahan, and the taking over by the British of the Gendarmerie. The Earman Earma and the Consul, who were at Lehbid when the opposition to His Highness’s advance broke out, retired to Abadeh. There they remained for some time, until matters were arranged by orders from Tehran and by diplomacy. The Earman Earma reached Shiraz in the middle of October, accompanied by the Consul. He was welcomed by the Qavam but not by the'Saulat, who had left Shiraz a few days previously. The attitude of the Qashqai Chief w-as that of a semi-rebel. He paid no revenue , but professed to be an obedient servant of the Persian Government. 4. Appointment of Salar^i-Hishmat to ifemw.--Shortly after the arrival of the Earman Earma at Shiraz he appointed the Salar-i-Hishmat, a member of the Nuri family, to Kazerun, with instructions to trouble the Saulat, more especially in the Mamaseni country, where the Qashqai Chief had leased large estates from the Muin-u-Tujjar. The Salar-i-Hishmat has explained to the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, the unwisdom of this provocative action unless there was strong force behind it. 5. Stirring up of the Nasir Diwan by the Saulat and capture of the South Fersian Fifes garrison at Kazerun .—The Earman Earma, unknown to the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, who had not reached Shiraz until a month after His Highness, was playing with fire. The leading Kalantar of Kazerun, the Nasir Diwan, a noted disturber of the peace who had fought the Swedish Gendarmerie, was incited by Saulat to upset the Earman Earma’s intrigues. This he effectually accomplished by treacherously seizing the South Persia Rifles garrison, which had only just been taken over by the British, and by imprisoning the Governor. About two-thirds of the tiny Indian column was sent out to attempt to restore the situation, but the forces holding the very difficult Pir-i-Zan Tass w 7 ere too strong, and Kazerun w r as abandoned for the time being. M6. Consulate mission to Saulat-ud-Dauleh, May 1917. —During the winter affairs remained staiionary, the Nasir Diwan governing Kazerun and the Saulat sending insolent messages to the Damian Parma, who swore he would attack him in the spring migration 1917 a very wild threat. The Consul opened up relations with the Saulat, who stated that he desired to meet the Consul and the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, in the spring, to talk over matters and come to a friendly agreement. As a preliminary step, Mr. Bristow the Vice- Consul was sent to the camp of the Saulat. A telegram from His Majesty’s Minister and a letter from the Consul to the Qashqai Chief were to be deliver ed by Mr. Bristow, but he complains in one of his letters that he knew the contents of neither. In accordance with the system prevailing and believed to be approved by the Minister, by jvhich the Inspector-General kept the Consul in touch wdth everything he did, but was kept almost entirely in the dark by the latter until political arrangements w ere made, Mr. Bristow was, not given an opportunity of being posted up in the military position by the Inspector-General or his Staff. As was only to be expected, the result of the Mission w r as wholly unsatisfactory. Mr. Bristow on the 6th May concluded an agreement with the Saulat-ud-Dauleh which ran as follows:— ‘ Camp at Jireh 6th May 1917, 14 Bn jab 1335. ’ ‘I, Ernest Bristow, on behalf of Lieutenant-Colonel Gough, His Majesty’s Consul at Shiraz, have come to the following agreement with His Excellency Sardar Ashayar Saulat-ud-Dauleh, Ilkhani of the Qashqais. His Excellency shall take all the necessary steps for the pacification of Kazerun and restoring order on the roads from Kazerun to Shiraz. Those responsible for the troubling shall be granted an amnesty so that in future they may be en gaged in their own business, and prevented from creating further trouble. Kazerun and the road from there to Shiraz shall be entrusted to His Excellency Saulat-ud-Dauleh for a period of three months and it is left to His Excellency to take what steps he deems expe dient in the interests of order. On the condition that Nasir-ud-Diwan shall be absent from Kazerun for a period of six months but his life and property shall be safe and not interfered with. The payment of the road-guards shall be given to Saulat-ud-Dauleh in accordence with an arrangement hereafter to be come to between His Excellency and His Majes ty’s Consul, so that the former himself may make the necessary payments to the afore-mentioned road-guards. The responsibility for order at Kazerun and on the road between that town anti Shiraz shall be on Saulat-ud-Dauleh for the period of three months. Neither party shall change these conditions. ERNEST BRISTOW, His Majesty's Vice-Consul. It is to be noted (A) that for half the distance to Kazerun the road was at the time in possession of the South Persia Rifles w r hich occupied strong posts, and (B) that Nasir Diwan was our enemy and still hostile towards us. Yet, under the preposterous arrangement outlined above, the Consulate was at liberty to give up posts held by us, and to make terms with the enemy without previous consultation wdth the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, who was also commanding a force of Indian troops. The position created by this agreement wan very serious. Had we repudi ated it we should rightly have incurred the charge of bad faith. It was accordingly arranged that the agreement should be accepted provisionally, but that the obnoxious clauses should be discussed at a meeting between the Saulat, the Inspector General, and the Consul. The Saulat was given 30,000 tumans by Mr. Bristow during his visit, for services which it was hoped that he would render. 7. Muhammad AH Khan, Eashkuli —Early in April 1917, just before Mr. Bristow started on his mission to the Saulat, Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli,8a who had broken away from the Saulat and was his bitter enemy, wrote to the Consul and offered to take a hill which dominates the Pir-i-zan pass. His offer was accepted, as it meant a blow to the Nasir JDiwan, and the “ Chang , as it was termed, was taken and held. At first it was proposed that the South Persia Bifles should take over the post, but in view of the very difficult and dangerous line of communications, this proposal was abandoned. It appears that the scheme was not sound, as this encouragement of Muhammad Ali Khan irritated the Saulat, who regarded him as a rebellious Kalantar. It also led to nothing. 8. Mesting of the Inspector General, South jPersia Rifles, and Consul with Saulat, 22nd-2oth May The meeting with the Saulat took place near Khan eh Zinian. At first he was intensely suspicious, but gradually he became almost friendly. He however naturally clung to the Bristow agreement; and it was with the utmost difficulty that he was induced to allow the South Persia Bifles to retain their posts on the Kazerun road, with half the garrisons consisting of Qashqais, This arrangement worked pretty badly throughout the three months of its existence. An agreement was signed embodying the above, and also assur ances from the Parman Parma and ourselves that Saulat w'ould be recognised as llkhani, so long as he maintained order in the tribes and paid revenue. Among the stipulations were the exile of the Nasir Hi wan from Kazerun for six months, and the arrest of a notorious intriguer. It is needless to say that the Saulat neither expelled Nasir Hi wan, nor did he seize the intriguer. On the other hand, throughout the summer of 19 L7 when we were Very weak, he restrained his tribes from attacking us or raiding on the high road. He therefore may be considered to have come into our orbit to some extent, and it was hoped that he would gradually realise that it was to his interest to be friendly, rather than hostile, to the British. 9. Hostility of Farman Farma to the agreement with the Saulat .—The Parman Parma, as a Persian Prince, considered that it was his right to crush the Saulat whom he disliked ; and, although he had agreed to the assurances and other terms in the agreement, at a conference held shortly before the meeting, he now complained loudly and bitterly to us, saying that the Saulat was “ King of Pars.” At that time His Highness was encouraging the democrats, and went so far as to denounce the Saulat to the mullahs for having become a British subject! He also protested vehemently to Tehran. His lengthy telegram, instead of being dealt with by the friendly Cabinet of the^ Vusugh-ud Hauleh, was decyphered by the new Cabinet, which made some capital out of it 10. Visit of Farman Farma to the Saulat-ud-Douleh .—The Consul in July pointed out to the Parman Parma that his refusal to accept the agreement with the Saulat was creating an impossible situation, as the Qashqai Chief complained that his Kalantars were giving trouble on that account, and the road would be upset. The Farman Parma meditated on the matter, and wrote his adherence to the agreement. He furthermore decided to tour, on the pretence of inspect ing a post in the vicinity of the Saulat’s camp, with the result that he was the guest of the Qashqai Chief for a couple of days. Buring that period there was a great display of Persian diplomacy, Hi® Highness and the Saulat becoming friends over the brilliant idea of the forme** arranging for the Saulat to take over charge of the road and Kazerun, in return for a huge subsidy from the British, to be paid through the Parman Parma! This arrangement was not sanctioned and excited some caustic comments from the Beputy Besldent, Bushire, which were fully justified. 11. Fotitical situation during the winter of 1917-1918 .—The visit of the Parman Parma to the Saulat closed Avhat may be described as the first act of the drama. Buring the summer and autumn of 1917, columns of Indian troops and South Persia Bifles operating from Behbid in the first instance and later from Behbid, Shiraz, and Kirman, inflicted punishment on the Kurshulis, Lashanis, Chahar Bahis, and Tutakis. The effect, so^ far as these tribes were concerned, was good, and our lines of communication became safer. British prestige was also enhanced by columns overrunning mountainous districts in the province, and defeating robber tribes without difficulty. The hostility of the Persian Government, of the democrats, and of the uncurbed press, had first been noticeable in June 1917, after the fall of the m 284 Vusugh-ud-Dauleh cabinet. During the autumn, its rancour and influence increased to a marked extent, and before the end of 1917 the Persian officers and men of the South Persia Iiifles began to be affected by it. A series of attacks against the British and the South Persia Bifl.es was engineered from Tehran under the auspices of Mukbir-us-Saltaneh, Minister of the Interior, whose main instrument was the Paqr-us-Saltaneh, a red-hot democrat, once in the pay of the Germans, who owned land in the Lashani country, and near Khaneh Zinian and Kazerun. To give an example of this hostility, the Meshedi Jan Khani Arabs on the 1st January 1918 attacked a South Persia Bifles patrol, and looted several caravans neax the Tang-i-Kamin. The Burma Mounted Bifles made a forced march from Shiraz and punished the tribe severely, recovering several of the looted camels It is noteworthy that the robbers had released all camels except those carrying Soudi Persia Bifles supplies, alleging that they had orders from Tehran to this effect. In May 1918, Meshedi Jan Khan met Lieutenant-Colonel Grant and said that he was absent at Darab wdien his tribe attacked the road, and acknowledged that the tribe had been led astray by the Paqr-us-Saltaneh, who gave them or ders on behalf of the Persian Government that the British were to be attacked and harrassed in every }X)ssible way, pending the arrival of a Bakhtiari force which wmuld drive them out of the country. In view of the fact that robberies had almost ceased on the Pars section of the Isfahan road, this robbery ana another at Khani-LKhurreh were significant. Again, near Bundar-Abbas on the 28th December 1917 a strong body of Mazidi tribesmen attacked and captured a caravan consisting mainly of saddlery for the South Persia Bifles, at Kirman. It was subsequently proved that this robbery was instigated by the Saulat, who also apparently mooted the idea of seizing the Inspector-General, and holding him as a handle,” as he put it. Another form of hostility was the issue of orders to stop all forward purchas ing of supplies under severe penalties Finally, the Karguzar was instructed to draw up claims for compensation in all cases whe;e the British had destroyed property, although it w r as notorious that only robber tribes and villages had been attacked. Other instances proving hostility were reported and could be cited. v 11. British Rote to the Version Government. —On the 11th March 1918 His Majesty ’s Minister delivered a note to the Persian Government, which after referring to recent public utterances of His Majesty’s Govern ment, in which entire adhesion to the policy of the independence of Persia was laid down, v r ent on to demand friendliness, guarding of frontiers against the return of enemy agents, and the formal recognition of the South Persia Bifles until the end of the w'ar, wdien the two Governments would discuss the formation of a uniform force for the whole of Persia. In return, liberal finan cial assistance and the suspension of the 190/ agreement were promised. Finally it was laid down that British troops would occupy part of Azerbaijan to protect the frontiers of Persia, but that they would in any case be with drawn at the end of the war. There were other clauses of less importance. 13. Reply of the Version Government. —The reply of the Persian Govern ment was to the effect that the despatch of British troops to Persia had rendered futile the Persian attempt to preserve neutrality; and that the Persian Govern ment could not recognize the South Persia Bifles, which were a foreign force, and a menace to Persian independence and integrity. Other clauses followed. The reply ended by stating that the Persian Government were desirous of preserving complete neutrality, and hoped that His Majesty’s Government would leave them alone to begin reforms in the country. 14. Results of the Version reply. —It is not intended to criticise the British note, but to narrate the results. Intelligent Persians however expressed the view that such a note, unless backed up by force sufficient to assure its acceptance, was, under present conditions, bound to receive an unfavourable reply. The open refusal to recognise the South Persia Bifles was undoubtedly the main cause of the present serious state of affairs, although the retreat of the Allies in Prance influenced the policy of the Persian Government. Evenat the No Buz celebrations the astute Earman Earma wished to avoid the presence of the South Persia Befles at the ceremony, but the Inspector-General insisted on His Highness yielding on this question. His Highness however tried hard to avoid 'holding written intercourse with the South Persia Rifles, and again there was much difficulty in persuading His Highness to modify this attitude even to a small extent. The position of the Earman Earma was one of extreme difficulty, but, as he was being paid by us, it was considered that he should have helped more than he did. At this time his idea appa rently was to be rewarded by the British Government, and to resign immediately. Tc give an instance of His* Highness’s impracticable attitude, he was asked to help to supply transport to meet the reinforcements then on their way up from Bunder-Abbas. This he failed to do so perforce five hundred animals were requisitioned. His Highness, after the urgency of the matter was explained at a personal interview, demanded the release of the animals. In other words he preferred that the troops should be stranded at a village half way up from the coast rather than that merchants should he temporarily inconvenienced. At this period the Saulat wrote to his friends in Shiraz to the effect that, he did not wish to tight the British, but that he was being pressed to do so from Tehran. Generally speaking our friends were discouraged, our enemies, and especially the democrats were encouraged, and the disaffection in the South Persia Rifles became a cause of serious anxiety 15 Desertions from Abadeh and Dehbid .—The Government of India had been warned ear y in April that desertions from the South Persia Rifles on a large scale might occur. Unfortunately this forecast proved correct. On the 18th April an aspirant and ten men with sixteen rifles deserted from Abadeh, while almost simultaneously a Vakil with twelve men deserted with their arms and some mules while returning from Dehbid to Abadeh. The majority of the latter par y rejoined. The Abadeh deserters left a docu ment behind which indicated that the desertion was political. They were pursued by Captain Winter with a troop whose loyalty was not assured, and two of whose number deserted on the road. Six of the deserters were captured near Isfahan, and were executed by the escort of His Majesty’s Consul-General. Colonel Haig, to whom we are deeply indebted for strong support, subsequently reported chat the effect of the execution in Isfahan was good. The Minister found fault with the execution as being excessive in severity and considered that it was injudicious to have executed the men in the Isfahan province. In reply it was pointed out that the punishment was not excessive in view of the critical position, and that it would have been inexcusable to have risked Captain M'inter’s life any further by sending the prisoners back under escort of their comrades for execution at Abadeh. Subsequent events ha^e fully justified this view. On the 15th May eighteen sowars deserted from Qadrabad with horses, arms, and mules. They have not been arrested hitherto. Although it is objectionable from the military pcint of view to make detachments of Indian troops, a double company of Indian Infantry was despatched to Abadeh, at this period, to give some support to the British Officers of the South Persia Rifles. A. platoon of this detachment was left at Dehbid where the caravanserai is very strong. 16. Arrest of Mirza Abdul Bahim.~On the 26th April a letter from the Eaqr-us-Saltaneh addressed to the Baha-us-Sultan, the leading Shiraz Democrat, was intercepted. In it it was stated that letters to Zair. Khidr, Nasir Diwan, and others had also been sent. The letter contained instructions to the party to shew hostility to the British in every possible way. Perhaps the most important statement was that Mirza Abdur Rahim, the newly appointed officer of justice and a notorious Democrat, was bringing down written and verbal instructions from the Mukbir-us-Sultaneh. It is to be noted that the Mudabbar-us-Sultaneh, Nuri, the dismissed officer of justice, was among our few genuine friends, and had been dismissed on that account. Upon the request of the Earman Earma and the Consul, Mirza Abdul Rahim was arrested by the Officer Commanding, South Persia Rifles, at Abadeh. He was subsequeutly sent hack to Isfahan.86 A second Democrat, Mirza Humayun Khan, who had been appointed to the post of Chief of the Revenue, held by a servant of the Farman Farma, stopped at Isfahan upon hearing the news, and has not resumed his journey. 17. Flat against the Niriz Garrison. —On the 1st May a letter written by Shaykh Hasan, Revenue Officer at Nariz, to the Mukbir-us-Sultaneh was intercepted. In it the receipt of instructions was acknowledged, and it was stated that a plot to capture Niriz was being arranged, and that the Labu Muhammadi Arabs and the ChahHaqis were ready. It w r as asked that instruc tions should be given to the Lashanis to unite forces with the above. The genuineness of the letter was not indisputable, but the facts were pretty accurate, and it was decided to take prompt military action. The reinforcements then moving to Shiraz were met at Niriz and a strong column under Lieut.-Colonel Grant in a series of forced marches inflicted severe punishment on the Chah Haqis, Labu Muhammadis, and Chahar Rahis. There is little doubt that this expedition has helped to keep the Arabs quiet and Niriz safe, at a time when strong inducements were held out to them to attack our lines of communication. But for this expedition the number of our enemies would have been much greater. 18. Military position at the outbreak of hostilities icith the Saulat-ud- Fauleh. —The conflict with the Qashqai tribe, to avoid which every endeavour had been made during the past eighteen months, found us stronger than at any previous period. Reinforcements in the shape of an infantry regiment, two sections of mountain artillery, and a squadron of mounted infantry, to gether with the issue of Lewis guns, had doubled the strength of the fighting force. Officers and men had also learned a good deal about the country, Staff organisation, Intelligence, Supply and Transport, Medical Services, etc , etc., had all gained valuable experience. 19. Relations between the Military and the Folitical. —Unfortunately a question of extreme importance had not been settled, namely, the rela tions between the Military and Political. Reference has already been made to the dangerous position created by the political authori ties handifig over charge of the South Persia Rifles’ posts to the Saulat in the spring of 1917. The Inspector-General visited Tehran shortly after wards. He explained the military point of view to the Minister, but Sir Charles Marling refused to discuss any military questions on the ground that they did not interest him. The day the Inspector-General left Tehran, the Minister handed him a letter (No. 11, dated the 20th June) in which the relations between the Military and Political w r ere laid down. It was pointed out that the instructions would create an impossible military situation. It was within the competency of the Minister to give such instructions to Sir Percy Sykes in his capacity as Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, but not in his capacity as General Officer Commanding the Indian escort troops, for whose operations and safety he w T as responsible. The instructions were in direct oj^position to what is laid down for a General Officer in command of a lorce in the field in time of war, and in the opinion of Sir Percy Sykes were calculated to risk the failure of military operations. When at Delhi during the winter of 1917-1918, Sir Percy Sykes raised the wdiole question and found the military authorities most sympathetic on the subject. Some relief from an intolerable position w r as afforded by a telegram dated the 4th June forwarding instructions of His Majesty’s Government, whereby the force under Sir Percy Sykes was placed under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief in India. The instructions, however, upset the relations between the Military and Political. On the side of the Military all information was given and the Consul was consulted in all matters touching the political side. The Consul on the other hand rarely consulted the Military beforehand, but merely informed them of various arrangements made by him. The position was aggravated by a series of personal telegrams exchanged between the Consul and the Minister, dealing apparently with current affairs in Pars, but of which the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, had no knowledge whatever. It is hoped that all these telegrams may be shewn to the Government of India, as by this means the situation will be elucidated materially.87 This matter was reported to the Government of India, and their instruc tions were given to the Consul to co-operate frankly and genuinely. Even so, the situation w r as not satisfactory, with military operations ^ on a considerable scale in progress in Ears. During a period of active military operations, the General Officer Commanding a force in the field, and his head quarters staff, must obviously he in a position to control all the factors which affect those operations, and which influence the safety of the troops under the command of the General Officer Commanding. In such a case it is not possible to divorce military and political factors, nor military and political control, without running risks of military plans being upset, and the safety of the troops being jeopardized. The Consul at Shiraz has claimed and exer cised an independent control of political affairs. He has claimed the right to be kept fully informed of events to enable him to make and carry out political plans. He has arranged his own independent conferences with the Governor-General and the Qavam-ul-Mulk. As a result of these conferences messages have been sent and negotiations have been arranged with our enemies, with friendly chiefs and with neutral chiefs whom it was desired to influence and bring on to our side. It frequently happened that the messages and the course of negotiations were communicated to military headquarters oniy^ after decisions and actions had been taken. Various political measures considered essential by the military headquarters, such as the case of the appointment of the Sardar Ehtesham as llkhani of the Qashqais in place of the Saulat, were allowed by the Consul to hang fire for several days, in spite of repeated representations. During actual military operations, there is only one place for a political officer, especially a political officer junior in rank to the General Officer Commanding namely the confidential political adviser to the General Officer Commanding, under whose orders and in co-operation with whose staff, he shall exercise his political activities. To take any other course is to court military disaster. 20. Operations against the Darrashuris .—On the 10th May a party of Darrashuris stole two donkeys belonging to the South Persia Rifles post at Khaneh Zinian. When the matter was reported to. the Officer Commanding a party of South Persia Rifles was sent out, which recovered the animals and captured the three robbers. The Kalantar, the notorious Ayaz Kikha, promptly sent a message to say that unless the three Darrashuris were released immediately, the fort would be attacked. Railing compliance by Captain Will, the Qashqais surrounded the fort on three sides, and opened fire on it. Captain Will gallantly sallied out, and drove off the enemy, inflicting two casualties. Upon the matter being reported to Shiraz, the Officer Commanding Pars Brigade was despatched with four hundred men of the South Persia Rifles. He cleared the vicinity of the fort in the face of some opposition, inflicting fifteen casualties, as against one suffered by the South Persia Rifles. After ids return to the shelter of the fort, the enemy were reinforced to the number of 2,500. A column of Indian troops was accordingly despatched under Lieutenant-Colonel Holbrooke, which found the country clear of the enemy, the united forces subsequently returning to Shiraz with some prisoners and captured sheep. 21. Declaration of hostilities by the Sanlat-ud-Dauleh .—During the middle of May the Saulat engaged in a heated correspondence with the Rarman Rarma, under cover of which he collected a large force of tribesmen at Siakh, some twenty-five miles to the south of Shiraz. He also tried to win over the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, the malcontents among the Arab tribes, the mullas of Shiraz and outlying districts, and every section of the community with which he had connexion or which was hostile to the British. He pointed out that the South Persia Rifles were a foreign force repudiated by the Persian Government, and that he was determined to fight to the death to drive the British ont of Persia. Attempts to preach a holy war were only partially successful. The Rarman Rarma, whose behaviour at this crisis is worthy of the highest praise, wrote a series of masterly letters to the Saulat, and drafted equally clever telegrams to the Persian Government, who to some/ 88 extent accepted his views. On the other hand, the pri/t,te telegrams of the iSamsam-ns-Sultaneh, the Bakhtiari Premier, to the feaulat, one of which was read by the Barman Parma, vrere couched in friendly ar d sympathetic terms. The Parman Parma took various precautions for the maintenance of order in the city, as it was evident that our enemies would try to create disturban ces. 22. First action at Deh Shaikh .—The column which had been operating against robber tribes fortunately reached Shiraz on the 23rd May, the very day on which the Saulat’s declaration of open hostility Tvas received. On the 24th May a column 1,500 strong marched out to Ghinar llahdar, six miles to the wesl of Shiraz. In the morning it entered the hills and at Deh Shaikh encountered very heavy opposition. The Sauiat had expected the force to relieve Khaneh Zinian, and intended to cut it off on its return. Colonel Orton had realized this, and, after gaining Deh Shaikh pressed southwards across the hills towards the Qara Agich valley, instead of continuing westwards towards Khaneh Zinian. This well-armed enemy, some five thousand strong, shewed extreme bravery and equal mobility. It was reported later that they had hoped to capture the rifles and mules of the “ Hindi ”, whom they regarded as an easy prey, but they were bitterly disillusioned, In spite of the very difficult ground and the absence of water, the column pressed ahead, repelling dangerous rushes and attempts to work round the flanks, and inflicting heavy losses with guns, Lewis guns, rifle fire and bayonets. The enemy stubbornly held every lidge until sunset, when the site of the camp of the Sauiat at Khan-i-Khabis w as occupied, the enemy then disappearing in headlong flight. Heavy losses, 250 killed and 450 wmunded, w 7 ere inflicted, on the enemy, whereas British losses w 7 ere numerically light, only amountingto 18 killed and 33 wounded. They however included tw r o valuable British officers wdio w ere killed. The colummreturned to Deh Shaikh, and Colonel Orton there learned for the first time of the surrender of Kbaneh Zinian. He accordingly returned to Shiraz where the situation was most unsatisfactory. This action at Deh Shaikh was not decisive, as the Sauiat returned to his camp a few days later, wdiile the garden quarter to the north-w r est of Shiraz was filled with Kazeruni riflemen wdto robbed the harvest and the orchards At the same time it gave the Qashqais a very severe lesson and made them realize that they v 7 ere up against a very powerful enemy. 23. Tragedy at Khaneh Tinian.- The South Persia Rifles post at Khaneh Zinian was very strong wdtli plenty of supplies. It was garrisoned by Captain Will, Sergeant Coomber, and 160 Persian officers and men. Captain Will had on the 23rd May reported that he could hold out as long as was necessary. The Sauiat had, however, sent a letter to the garrison to the effect that the South Persia Rifles, were not recognised by the Persian Government, and that an order had been received fromTebran to expel the British. It ended with an appeal to join him. This document probably brought to a head a pre-arranged plot, and on the 25th May the garrison mutinied. The unfortunate British officer was treacherously shot, but, Sergeant Coomber was able to defend himself for some hours, and killed and w ounded some of bis assailants before he w r as wounded and captured. The door of the fort was subsequently opened to Meshedi Muhammad Ibrahim farrashhashi of the Nasir Diwan, the ammunition, rifles, and stores were taken and the treacherous South Persia Rifles stripped and released. Captain Will and Sergeant Coomber w ere still alive, and w r ere finished off by the Kazeruni lofangchis 24. Qavvam-ul-JMulk. —After the Chief of the Qashqais, the most influential local magnate in Pars is the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, who is hereditary Mayor of Shiraz, and Chief of the Khamseh or “ Pfive ” Arab tribes. The guilds of traders in Shiraz are organised by him and are generally devoted to his family, so that peace or disturbance in Shiraz mainly depend on the Qavvam. The present holder of the post is about thirty, knows English, and is distinctly friendly to the British, who saved his father in the spring of 1916 His character is however very w 7 eak, and but for the Parman Pharma he would never have joined cur side. His Highness hardly ever let him out of his sight, and even induced him to sleep frequently at the Ark. While under this influence the Qavvam was alion, but if he slept at home adverse influences nearly won him over, and he was a mouse when he returned to the Ark. However the extraordinary personality of the Harman Farm a, after many fluctuations, finally won the day. His Highness furthermore conceived the brilliant idea of the Qavvam conducting the negotiations with Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, and thereby made him openly declare himself on our side. A recent message received by the Qavvam from the Saulat was to the effect that the assassin of his uncle the late Nasr-ud-Dauleh was protected and lived among the Qashqais, but that the destined assassin of himself was a member of his own household. This message should help to keep him on our side. 25. Sirdar Ehtesham, the new Ilkhani —Ahmad Khan, the Sirdar Ehtesham, aged about forty-two, is the half-brother of the Saulat, and the eldest surviving brother of the family. Ali Khan, Salar-i-Hishmat, is his full brother. He was Ilkhani in 1906, and again five years later. In neither case, for various reasons, was he able to maintain himself. He is not believed to have a strong character, but is popular, less unreliable than the Saulat, and much more civilized and reasonable. At the beginning of the trouble it was evident to the Inspector-General and his staff that the Sirdar should be used as an important card in the game, and the Consul was informed accordingly. Unfortunately the Sirdar Ehtesham had a grievance against the Consul and his Munshibashi for insisting on him (the Sirdar), visiting the Saulat in 1917, and making peace with him. This action the Sardar, as elder brother and late Ilkhani, considered to be derogatory to himself and a blow to his honour and he had not visited the Consul since that date. He visited the Inspector-General, with whom he has always had cordial relations, on the 5th June, and stated most emphatically that he was on our side, and prepared to work for us. He however feared that we might make peace with the Saulat,wind demanded a written guarantee, to be signed by the Consul and the Inspector-General, that if he aided us, his honour and interests would be safeguarded. He declared that if supported by us, he was confident that he could break the Saulat. He stated that after the action of Deh Shaikh, Ali Khan had offered to join him with 500 sowars if the Sirdar were made Ilkhani. The Farman Farma, however, from fear of Tehran, refused to consider the matter. This fact leaked out a month later. It was explained to the Sirdar that the case would be referred to the Consul, but that Inspector-General was in sympathy with his request. The matter was not considered favourably by the Consulate, the point of view being held that the Sirdar had no influence. On the 22nd June, or nearly a month after the action at Deh Shaik, a second communication was made to the Consul, stating that the Inspector-General and staff attached great impor tance to a written assurance being given to the Sirdar Ehtesham that we should not make terms with the Saulat, and that other assurances demanded should be given. The same day the Consul replied that he had given these assurances. It appears however that the Sirdar was only shewn, (and not given), this letter by the Farman Farma, who kept it himself, and that the letter as shewn him contained no assurances. A request w r as made to the Consulate for a copy of this important document, but the reply was received that the record in the Consulate had been destroyed, and so the matter must remain obscure. According to the Sirdar Ehtesham, he was merely asked to persuade his brother Ali Khan to desert Saulat and join him, in return for an allowance of 250 tumans per month. Ali Khan declined to join his brother unless the latter were appointed Ilkhani. The Munshibasi told the Consul, who informed us, that Ali Khan had sent back insulting references to the Sirdar having joined the infidels. It is doubtful whether the Munshibasi iQyoTtQd. the facts. The Sirdar absolutely denies the above. On the 29th June the Consul was again informed that Sirdar Ehiesham stated that he had received no written assurance. The Consul had not apparently seen the Sirdar personally all this time, and he was begged by the Inspector- General to carry on the delicate negotiations with him in person, and not through the Munshibasi who was gravely mistrusted. The Consul stated that the Sirdar had received his letter of assurance, and wished some change made in it with a view to his brother’s name being omitted, and that this was being done. It is believed that the Munshibashi did not translate the whole of the Consul’s90 first letter, if indeed it contained the assurances, but in any case omitted the part containing the assurances. On the Sirdar complaining, the Consul was told as above. A second letter containing assurances was written, and on the 30th June, late at night, the Consul’s letter was shewn, not given, to the Sirdar hy the harm an Parma. His Highness excused himself for the delay on the grounds of his recent indisposition. There is no doubt that both the Harman Farma and the Munshibashi were hostile to the appointment of the Sirdar Ehtesham as Ilkhani In any case the facts gave us serious cause for anxiety. About this time Ali Khan agreed to join the Sirdar, and Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli. On the 2nd July the Inspector-General was shewn two agreements made (a) between the Qavvam and Sirdar Ehtesham, and (b) between Sirdar Ehtesham and Ali Khan, from which it appeared that the keystone of the agreements was the appointment of the Sirdar Ehtesham to be likhani. That night, at 9 p.m. the Consul,* Inspector-General, and staff called to congratulate Farman Farma and the Qavvam on the great succe&gt;s of their efforts The Inspector-General insisted on the supreme importance of the immediate official appointment of the Sirdar Ehtesham to be Ilkhani, without which the negotiations could not be considered to be completed. The Consul did not support the Inspector-General while the Farman Farma talked about awaiting orders from Tehran, and in any case of delaying matters. On the 3rd July the Inspector-General received secret information that the Munshibashi was hostile to the appointment of the Sirdar, and also that the Qavvam would withdraw unless the appointment were made before the 4th July. At a conference which was held, the Consul laid down that the question must be “ left to the wonderful political acumen of His Highness”. The Ins pector-General pointed out that it was essential to our interests that the appointment should be made immediately, but that the Farman Farma feared to make it without permission from Tehran, and that his fears, and not his wonderful political acumen, were at work. Finally the Consul agreed to urge the appointment, which united pressore secured. On the following day the sons of the Farman Farma informed the Ins pector-General that His Highness realized the necessity for the appointment, but that it took their united efforts to induce their father to take the final step, and to trust to the British for protection and compensation in case the Persian Government condemned his action. It is the belief cf the Inspector-General and his staff that the Earman Farma Munshibashi determined to delay this compromising act until the telegraph line was opened. The Farman Farma tried threats and bribery in the case of the Inspector-General’s Persian Aides-dc-Camp, who reported the Ins pect or-General’s insistence on the appointment. His Highness w r as also surprised and angry when informed that the Consul had finally joined the Inspector-General in insisting upon the appointment. It is no exaggeration to state that any delay in making this appointment might have broken up tluTanti-Saulat confederacy. 26. Situation after the action at Deh Shaikh. —The position at Shiraz was one of conside able difficulty. Relief operations at that time appeared necessary, but owing to the intense heat troops cannot fight near the coast during the summer, so that operations from Bushire could not commence until early October, except in case of extreme necessity. It was considered by the Inspector-General and staff that six aeroplanes might prove a valuable rein forcement, and they were consequently asked for. It was however pointed out from Simla that owing to the multiplicity of spare parts, etc., the scheme was not practicable. A minimum force of one battalion, one battery mountain artillery, and two squadroi s was asked for, to march up country from Bandar- Abbas;' but it was finally decided to send a smaller column, consisting of a section mountain artillery, two squadrons cavalry, and one double company plus 200 rifles, which force left Bandar-Abbas on the 30th June and early in July At Shiraz the troops were concentrated inside a perimeter of walled gardens Avhich was strengthened by towers and in other ways. The supply91 question gave much anxiety, but by one means or another supplies came in. Money too was terribly scarce owing to the dislocation of trade. The enemy cut off most of the irrigation channels, but wells had been dug, and their number was now increased. The chief danger was a rising in the city, many buildimrs of which commanded the cantonments, although at long range. A rising would however have stopped the How of supplies. There were several cases of cholera, many being fatal. The enemy was holding the low hills at the western end of the Shiraz valley, from which the villages lay at their mere} 7 They also held the garden quarter up to about 1,200 yards from the fortified perimeter, on the range to the north they had Sangars. The untrustwortbiness of the South Persia Rifles was a cause of deep anxiety, and arrangements were made for placing Indian troons among them. A large number of Persian officers and men were gradually dismissed, and a careful watch was maintained. The strain on the British officers of the South Persia Rifles was intense. 27. Action of Ahmadabad, 16th June .—As the enemy had come within easy striking distance, it was decided to send out the column to inflict heavy punishment, and then to retire. This was effected with complete success, the Kazerunis being driven out of the valley, and the (^ashqais, who came to the rescue, suffering very heavily. Our casualties were relatively light. As however the column returned to the perimeter after the action, it was considered to be a defeat by the gullible Shirazis. The Saulat wrote in to his partisans that only one groom had been killed by the British, whose losses had been very heavy. In reality our losses w r ere 5 killed and 21 wounded. The enemy losses w r ere estimated at 200 killed and 300 wmunded. 28. Garrisoning of the city —On the 17th June the position in the city was very bad. Hostile demonstrations against the South Persia R fl.es and Indians culminated in attacks Tne Mullas issued written orders that it waslaw 7 - ful to attack anyone wffio had dealings with the British Bands of men and boys paraded the streets shouting “ Said nr' &gt; and everything pointed to a serious rising. At night, by agreement w T ith His Highness, the Madrassah Khan, Shsh Chiragh, and other key positions were seized by South Persia Rifles’ detach ments without fighting. A strong Caraoamerai near the Kazerun Gate was also occupied by Indian troops, who subsequently took over the chief key position. The South Persia Rifles in Shiraz, at this time, were incensed against the populace, who had begun to loot their houses and property. The results of this action were extraordinary, the being reopened, and the hostile element disappearing. A few arrests were also made. It nas evident that by Hie action of Ahmadabad and the seizing of the key positions in Shiraz, the enemy had definitely failed to effect their purpose. We w r ere warned of desperate attacks to be made by night, but they never materialized. 29. Break-up of the enemy .—On the 19th June the telegraph line was finally cut. On the 21st June the Consul issued a proclamation to the Qashqais that the British had no quarrel with the Qashqais, but only with Saulat. The Earman Earma also wrote letters to the various kalantars. Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, a brave fighting chief w ith 60 ) followers, and the bitter enemy of Saulat, had also come in, and had agreed to join the Earman Earma. Einally, after many intrigues, Ali Khan, wffio w r as holding the road to the north with 500 sowars, made terms, and joined the Sirdar Ehtesham, Muhammad Ali Khan, and the Qavvam, the latter taking the leading part in the negotiations. On the 2nd July the negotiations were concluded and embodied in two agreements: (A) Between the Qavvam and Sirdar Ehtesham and his brother to the effect that the Qavvam would help the tw r o brothers in every way and obtain assurances from the British not to molest them but to deal through the llkhani’, (B) between Sirdar Ehtesham and Ali Khan who swore to work together and to carry out their duties as llkhani and Ilbegi, respectively, with the Q.avvam as arbitrator and helper. As already mentioned, the Earman Earma was afraid to commit himself to the appointment of the Sirdar Ehtesham as Ilihani, butHis Highness finally yielded to strong pressure, and thereby ensured the success of the negotiations. The appointment of the new Ilkhani brought in the Farrashbashi (or Chief Staff Officer) of the Sa.ulat, whose following dwindled away. The Kazerunis also returned home, bitterly disappointed at gettin* no loot, and on very bad terms with the Saulat. 30. Execution of the Khaneh Zinian murderers on the 6th July. —The inquiry into the Khaneh Zinian tragedy had occupied more than a month. Pinally three officers and eleven men were sentenced to be shot to death. Others were sentenced to two floggings and dismissal, and the rest of the prisoners to dismissal. The Farman Farma and the Qavvam tried to induce the Inspector- General to postpone the executions, and the Nuri family petitioned that the life of the half-brother of the Karguzar, and Fath-ul-Mulk might he spared. It was not however a time for leniency, and the fourteen men were duly shot by their comrades of the 5th Infantry, South Persia Eifles, in the presence of the Indian troops and South Persia Rifles. After the execution, the senior Persian officer read a document signed by all the officers, in which hope was expressed that in the future the South Persia Eifles would be loyal, faithful, and brave. A brief speech m Persian was made by the Inspector-General. The effect on the South Persia Eifles, and also on Shiraz w r as excellent. 31. Action of Chincir Fcihdar, 7th-8th July. —As soon as the alliance was concluded, it was essential to drive Saulat away from Shiraz. This was not difficult, as the force left wuth him was less than one thousand. It w r as arranged that the Indian troops should attack him at Chinar Eahdar while the allies were to cross the Siakh range and cut him off. The Indian troops did their part, capturing the ridges above Chinar Eahdar, and driving about 600 Qashqais back to the Saulat’s camp at Ak Chashmeh The Persian allies were not very successful in cutting off the Saulat, but blood was spilt between two factions. It is hoped that Saulat will be deserted by his followers, and that Firuzabad and Kala Parghun will both be captured by the allies, who are being lent 2 mountain guns, and 2 maxim guns from the South Persia Eifles, in addition to rifles and ammunition, and are also being financed bv the British. ° J 32. Belief column for Abadeh.—During the night 8th-9th July, a mess enger brought in the news that the South Persia Eifles at Abadeh had joined Muhammau Ali Khan, Qashqai, and that the Indian troops who had fortunately been sent to Abadeh when the desertions took place, were besieged. It was stated that Muhammad Ali Khan had died of cholera, and that after tw r o or three attacks which were repulsed, the enemy was discouraged. Early on the 10th July, or less than 36 hours after the troops had returned from the action of Chinar Eahdar, a relief column left Shiraz under Lieutenant-Colonel Williams Officer Commanding Pars Brigade. It consisted mainly of Indian troops, with some South Persia Eifles, and was instructed to relieve Abadeh, and brin°* back its garrison. P. M. SYKES, Brigadier-General. A report w^as received on the 20th July that Lieutenant-Colonel Williams* column, marching 180 miles in 169 hours, had entered Abadeh without encoun tering any opposition, and had relieved the garrison, which had inflicted losses exceeding its own total strength, on the besiegers. P. M. SYKES./ A*- • h. 94 1 Company 16th Rajputs, with machine gun section (200 strong). 1 Section Indian Field Artillery under Major Illins (modified strength as laid down by Assistant Director, Medical Services^ memorandum). 3.

In continuation of my No,, 613-4-1-A. “dated: 27th July 1918, I have the honour to forward the following reports :— (i) Deport of Major W. A. K. Eraser, M.C., 0. C., Abadeh. {ii) Report of Lieutenant-Colonel V. P. B, Williams, O. -C., Relief ' Column. {Hi) Report of Subadar-Major Ali Dost, 106th Hazara Pioneers, who accompanied the Qavvam-ul-Mulk to Eiruzabad in pursuit of the Saulat-ud-Dauleh. 2. The Abadeh reports bear out the contention that the recent outbreak in Ears was the result of a carefully prepared plot, which shewed signs during April and early in May. The incidents at Khaneh Zinian (May 10th-14th) were clearly effects of the general plot, and not the cause of it. The movement throughout has been anti-British and anti-South Persia Rifle, and was engineered at Tehran. It has been a so-called Nationalist movement against the British, on the part of the Democratic party. It was encouraged by the pro-German elements and I am convinced that it was actively supported by the late Persian Cabinet by means of secret instructions to tribal chiefs and to Persian officials. The attempt to make the movement a religious one, i e., a Holy War or Jihad against the British, failed, but there was considerable fanaticism in the anti-British propaganda. 3. I have the honour to attach herewith a list of those whose services have been brought to notice, in connection with the operations now reported, for addition to the list already submitted with my No. 643-4-1-A., dated 27th July 1918 {By.

I have the honour to forward herewith a report on events at Abadeh during May, June, and July 1918, culminating in the attack by Mohamed Ali Khan, Qashqai, on the night of 28th-29th June, the mutiny of the South Persia Rifles and the subsequent investment of British ranks, Indian Troops, and loyal South Persia Rifles from that date until the arrival of the relief column on the morning of 17th July. The report is divided into two parts:—Part I dealing with the events previous to Mohamed Ali Khan’s attack, and Part II dealing with military dispositions and the incidents of the siege. I append, also, short notes on those persons mentioned in the report, and a list of those most prominent in intrigue and propaganda before and during the siege. I have the honour to bring to your notice the excellent work done through out the siege by the three platoons of the 16th Rajputs under Captain E. A. J,103 -Ljaville and Lieutenant F. C. Baker, particularly under very trying circum stances on the morning of the 29th June when they were subjected to a heavy friend 0 fromfoe eXPeCteC direction and wilen ifc was not P oss ible to distinguish ^ cheerfulness throughout the siege were deserving of me Jughest praise. ° I further wish to place on record my appreciation of the loyal services rendeied by all British ranks under my command. PABT I. Events peevious to June 28th. ^ ie en( ^ the condition of the South Persia Bifles in Abadeh was on t he whole satisfactory, although anti-South Persia Rifles’ propaganda had been continuous and Peisian^ officers and rank and file were disturbed by the consis tent refusal of the Persian Government to recognize the South Persia Rifles and also by the lack of any assurance from us that under all circumstances the future of those who had thrown in their lot with the South Persia Rifles and thus made enemies with a large section of their own people, would be guaianteed. dhis was particularly the case with those few Persian officers whose pro-British proclivities were so well known as to make them a special niaiov for threats and terrorisation. They and others would have served us better had they felt more certain of our power to protect them. This was pointed out in my Intelligence report for the period ending 15th April. ° ^ A considerable amount of harm was done by the assistant Karguzar of oinraz, who passed through Abadeh on his way to Teheran in April, and said many things detrimental to the South Persia Rifles. He made it widely known that a telegram had been received in Shiraz from the Cabinet to the effect that the Government would under no circumstances recognize the South Persia Rmes and that all who joined or helped it -were acting against the interests of their country. He said that the instructions of the Cabinet were that this telegram was to be published in Shiraz, but that the British had succeeded in suppressing its publication. Up to this time it was generally understood that although the South Persia Rifles had not been officially recognized yet the Persian Government were not actively against it. During April and May it was noticeable that many people were consider ably less inclined than formerly to advertise their connection with the South lersia Rifles, or to help us openly. This, I believe, was due to threats from Teheran, and to doubts as to the permanency of the British regime It mav also possibly have been due to the knowledge of impending troubles, as it was about this time (the end of April) that Mohammed All Khan Qashqai wrote to is supporters telling them that he had very good news from Saulat-ud-Dauleh which would be communicated to them in due course, and that he himself would be back before long as Deputy Governor of Abadeh. A few civilians who, up to this time, had been assiduously working for our \ favours and friendship, shewed a very distinct cooling off, in spite of profits made m the past and the possibility of profits in the future. The report of the Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s declaration of war had, at first no very marked effect on the rank and file. It was realized that Mohammad Ali Ahan Qashqai, being a close adherent of Saulat-ud-Dauleh, would probablv cause trouble around Abadeh, but it was the general opinion he would do nothing until something decisive had happened in Shiraz. The South Persia no^au^for 0 anxiht^ 016 dlsturbod b y the P ro spe«t&gt; and I had at that time However owing to information received from you as to the state of the South Persia Rifles m Shiraz, and realizing that the same state would possible spread to Abadeh, I removed the bulk of the ammunition and spare arms fromSouth Persia Rifles’ charge, and handed them over to the 16th Rajputs, and I watched most carefully for any change of attitude in officers and men, but I could find no signs of any widespread intrigue, and subsequent events Lave confirmed me in the belief that at that stage only a few officers and some of the vakils and men of the old gendarmerie had been initiated into the plot. The chief anxiety on all sides was tae attitude of His Excellency the Qavvam-ul-Mulk, and at no time was anyone convinced that he was really with us. Many reports were subsequently published as to secret instructions issued by him to the Arabs, and later on, when communication with Shiraz was broken off, it was said and believed that he had joined Saulat-ud-Dauleh. My opinion then was as long as the South Persia Rifles could be persuaded that we were on top, and meant to remain so, they would not turn actively against us. I had, however, very little hope of their being reliable in offensive fighting against Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai, if opportunity for such should present itself. A large number of the men belonged to the Abadeh and Qumisbeh districts, and had been brought up in fear of the Qashqais and Sarhaddis. Those whose homes were in the Abadeh district had previously seen Mohammed Ali Khan dismissed from the Deputy Governorship of Abadeh only to return, and they firmly believed that he would return again sooner or later. Mohammed Ali Khan’s agents were very explicit as to what would happen after the British had gone to anyone who had ventured to oppose him. On 27th May I received information that Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai was collecting the Sarhaddis, and intended to send some of his own men to Abadeh on the pretext of taking away his family who w ere living in his house in Abadeh, but really to occupy the towers of that house. These towers commanded a large part of the area occupied by the South Persia Rifles, and it was essential that they should be in our possession. Consequently I informed Mohammed Ali Khan’s wife that I regretted that I should be obliged to occupy the towers on the following day, and that if she wished to leave she was at liberty to do so without interference. She left the house on the following morning, and a South Persia Rifles’ post was established there without incident. The Sarhaddi tufangchis who had reached a village about 6 miles from Abadeh returned to their owm country. Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai, who up to this time had shewn no open hostility to us, now wnote me a letter expressing his regret that all his well-known services to the English had brought him so little reward and trust, to which I sent a suitable reply. A few days later he explained to the Deputy Governor that his collection of tufangchis was to avenge the insult to his wife, although it was well known that he had called up the Sarhaddis before any move was made against his house. He soon gave up this pose for that of “ Protector of Islam ”. In the beginning of June the rank and file of the South Persia Rifles began to get considerably more anxious as to the situation in Shiraz, as reports reached Abadeh that the Qashqais and Kazarunis were drawing closer to the town. It was widely circulated that the Saulat-ud- Dauleh was acting under the orders of the Persian Government, and that the Qavvam w ould shortly join him. Some colour was lent to this rumour by the fact that there was no evidence that either the Persian Government or His Highness Barman Parma were taking any decided action. It was also published that the English were too hard pressed in other theatres of war to spare any more troops for Persia. The effect of the report of the landing of troops in Bushire wore off when no information w as received as to any action by these troops. I anticipated that the attitude of the S. P. R. as it then was would lead to desertions, but I could see no reason to suspect they w r ould turn actively against us on any large scale. Frequent reports reached me that Muhammad Ali Khan Qashqai w T as in communication with some Persian officers, but though a very careful w atch was made, and every means at my disposal used to find out who these officers were, I did not succeed in doing so*before the mutiny took place.I considered and watched each Persian officer separately, five only I consi dered above suspicion and these all justified my belief in them, three being murdered by the rebels, and two remaining faithful throughout. All the other officers were, in my opinion, to be mistrusted, and the only way I could make sure of getting those implicated would have been to have arrested them all, and also a large number of vakils who had been associated with them in the old gendarmerie. As these included all the most capable officers' and N. C. O.’s the fighting value of the garrison would have been reduced to a dangerously low point. I considered that Sultan Kazim Khan and his relations Sultan Latif Khan and Naib Haidar Khan had too big an interest in the S. P. K. and, through a misappreciation of the general political situation, I believed that a man of Sultan Kazim Khan’s ability and intelligence, belonging to a family so well known and with so large a stake in the country, although he might intrigue would never dare to go the length of being openly hostile to the British. On June the 6th all Persian officers in Abadeh took an oath of loyalty to British officers, as had been done in Shiraz. This for the time considerably restored their confidence in each other. On the following day all Persian ranks w T ere offered their discharge. About 20 accepted. The remainder enthusiastically expressed their willingness to serve. In the beginning of June Muhammad Ali Khan Qashqai issued a procla mation to the people of Abadeh and district to the effect that he had been appointed by the “ Magam Aali” as the Protector of Islam, to drive the infi dels and foreigners out of Persia. He proclaimed that it was the duty of ail good Mussalmans to help him, and, that, if they failed to do so, any evil that might befall them through the actions of his large array of Sarhaddis, Qashqais, Boerahmadis and Bakhtiaris, would be on their own heads. He further pro claimed that no attention should be paid to any telegram published as coming from the Persian Government, as it would not represent their real views. He added “ I have true information that the object of the Government and the wishes of the nation are the protection of the brightness of Islam, and the defeat and destruction of our undesirable enemies.” After this proclamation strenuous attempts were made to rouse religious feeling. Harrowing tales were told of dead bodies of women and children murdered by the Indian garrison at Shiraz, and accusations of interference with women were made against the Indians sta tioned in Abadeh. These I investigated publicly, and they wx»re found to be quite without foundation. Agitation on these lines had practically no effect, as the previous good behaviour of the Indian troops in Abadeh was well known to the town and S. P. B. The Jehad had no more success, and even the. Mullahs intriguing against us largely abandoned religious for political arguments. Meanwhile the Saulat-es-Sultaneh, who had been in Abadeh since the beginning of May, was maintaining the most friendly relations with us, and had given me a great deal of information which turned out to be true. I am convinced that at this time his expressions of friendship were genuine, and that if he was inclined to take action at all it was on our side against his brother Saulat-ud-Dauleh, with whom he had been on bad terms for some time. Reports from the Sarhadd indicated that Muhammad Ali Khan Qashqai, who was being pressed continually by the Saulat-ud-Dauleh to take action, and who had up to this pleaded lack of men as an excuse for his inaction, intended to attempt an attack on Abadeh. It was reported that he expected that some at least of the S. P. R. post would not put up any defence. He had collected about 500 to 600 men, and both he and the Saulat-ud-Dauleh were making big efforts to get assistance from Mullah Gobad, Boerahmadi of Sisakhtjbut up to this without success. He and Saulat-ud-Dauleh -were also making efforts to get assistance from the Bakhtiaris, and several reports were received that some of them were preparing to come down. Muhammad Ali Khan’s force at this time consisted of Sarhaddis, [qlidis Kurshulis, and a few tufangchis from villages in the outlying districts of Abadeh. Saulat-es-Sultaneh assured me that, until he gave permission, the Kurshulis and such of the Sarhadd villagers as acknowledge him would not march on Abadeh. On the 8th June Muhammad Ali Khan Qashqai moved his force to a camp in the hills about 12 miles from Abadeh, and on the evening of the 9th106 I I lie apparently intended to attack. His force left its camp and his sowars arrived vs itlnn a mile or two of Abadeh, but no attack materialized. It was renorted rom many sources that the Kurshulis and many others refused to go wiihout orders from Saulat-es-Sultaneh. The attack was abandoned and the force retired to the vicinity of Iqlid, 21 miles S. W. of Abadeh. Saulat-es^Sultaneh informed me that, as a consequence of the action of his ^ han ’i qai ha 1 d written bitter complaints about tl - e i h ’, ; in ' lllat ’ as a11 ,lls family ami property were with the tribes m Sau^t-ud-Dauieb s pow-er, he could not afford to be at open enmity with the latter, unless he was strong enough to be able to defy him This I t0 6 ^ l,int ,, tha * aaleS9 118 ' 0t SOme defi '» e assurance'of support fio.u us, he rjould make terms with his brother. This was reported “ “ y c ! |) . 1 ' 8 ^ telegram No. 172 of li.th June, and subsequent telegrams on the same siiDiect. After Mohammed Ali Khan’s retirement to Iqlid, he and the democratic a = 8 “ , s 0 g ened 'P a , ■Vf y /'Serous campaign of intrigue and propaganda. This ran chiefly on the following lines :—• 1 „ ,“ That aS ! h , e S -, p ; . R - ! lad engased to fight the enemies of Persia, and as SauIat-ud-Dauleh and his allies were not enemies of Persia, but of the English there was no obligation to fight against them. ’ That Mussalman should not fight against Mussalman under the direction of an infidel power. “ That the S P. R. was being maintained against the wishes of the Persian (jovernment, and that it was the Shah’s wish that the force should be done away with. r\ whole of Pars was united in anti-British patriotism, and that the (^avTam would soon declare himself. “ That the English were too much embarrassed in Shiraz to help Abadeh and too much embarrassed elsewhere to help Shiraz.” There was also a certain amount of pro German propaganda, but this was not very prominent. The town was almost to a man helping Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai though some of them, being fearful of the effects of fighting locally would have welcomed peace. J Of the outlying villages the majority were actively and voluntarily help ing him. Practically nobody except the Bahader-ed-Divan of Surmaq dared to show us open friendship. Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai now claimed to have orders from the Government to drive out the Indian troops and the British officers of the S. P. R. He was particular to state that he had no quarrel with the Persian ranks of the S P. R. He also claimed to have authority to com mandeer grain, the amount so commandeered to be deducted from the owners’ malieh. He appointed himself Governor of Iqlid and he himself collected the revenues of this place. Prom this time until the attack on Abadeh, he pillaged the country around, giving, in some cases, receipts for what he had-taken. He was throughout in constant communication with many people in Abadeh. On June 15th an escort of 25 men, 3rd Infantry, S. P. R., proceeding to Khaneh Khurreh to meet a convoy from Dehbid, found the road blocked° by the enemy about 9 miles from Abadeh. The escort retired to a small fort near the road, where ^ they were not attacked by the enemy who, however, sent messages to induce the escort tJ desert, saying that any man who joined Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai would draw one tuman a day, but would not be forced to fight against the British if he did not wish to do so. A squadron was sent out to the relief of this party, which returned to Abadeh without further incident. Prom this time onwards both officers and men, particularly those officers whom I knew to be loyal, showed a strong disinclination to face the open The argument of officers of whose loyalty I had no doubt was that most of * the men had enlisted for the sake of food and clothing, and, although quite willing to go on serving as long as service meant training in barracks, or a very obvious and simple duty such as chasing robbers, they could not be altogether relied upon in difficult circumstances such as the present, when the great majority of r107 their countrymen were telling them that it was not their duty to fight against Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai, and that the problematical prospect of continu ing to draw krans 35 a month was not sufficient inducement to overcome the natural reluctance of the Persian villager (which is what the majority of them were) to face danger. The only men who had any fighting instincts were the men of the old gendarmerie from North Persia, who were at the same time those most likely to be mixed up in any intrigue. Patrols which w r ere sent out daily allowed parties of Mohammed Ali Khan’s sowars of inferior strength to ride about without interference, but in any case where a reconnais sance in force w^as made the enemy cleared off. An attack on Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai at Iqlid, though desirable from every military point of view, w r as, in the unsatisfactory condition of the S. P. It., and without guns, unlikely to meet with success. Meanwhile Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai was being urged on by the 13aulat-ud-Dauleh to attack Abadeh. He w T as at the same time disuaded from doing so by the Saulat-es-Sultaneh. Mohammed Ali Khan’s own inclination was to wait and see what w r as going to happen at Shiraz, and he was particu larly anxious to find out whether any change w r as going to be made in the Ilkhani-ship. Saulat-es-Sultaneh pointed out to me that the time had now arrived when Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai must decide definitely what he was going to do. Mohammed Ali Khan Qashquli was at that time in the Qashqai Sarhadd, apparently awaiting to be approached by either side. It was known that ,Saulat-ud-Dauleh had sent several messages to him. Saulat-es-Sultaneh suggest ed that I should make efforts to get Mohammed Ali Khan Qashquli on our side, but I knew too little of the political situation, and had no authority to make any offers. Saulat-es-Sultaneh has frequently made veiled enquiries as to the extent to wffiich we were prepared to support him, to which I was not authorized to give any definite or satisfactory reply. He now made a definite proposal which I telegraphed to you in my No 182-K., dated 17th June, to the -effect that if we could get Mohammed Aii Khan Qashquli on our side, and if we could help him with necessaries, he w ould join us and begin operations by taking over the Sarhadd. N’o reply was received to this telegram, as on June the 18th communication with Shiraz was interrupted. Saulat-es-Sultaneh had, I think, hoped that we would appoint him Ilkhani or II Begi in partnership with Sardar Ehtisham, an arrangement w T hick had existed on a previous occasion when Saulat-ud-Hauleh w r as dismissed. On June the 18th I had a meeting wdth the Goverorand Saulat-es-Sultaneh at the latter s request, at which the baulat expressed his willingness to assist in every way possible, but ne said that he had done all that could be done by his own arguments. He wished to be able to give Mohammed Adi Khan Qashqai a definite pledge from me that if he left Saulat-ud-Dauleh and helped us he would get some definite reward. He suggested that I should promise to get him reinstated as Deputy Governor of Abadeh. He had previously made some such similar suggestion, which I had referred to you by telegram on June 12th, and in accordance with your reply I now answered that the only assurance I could give was that w r e w T ould forget neither our friends nor our enemies The Saulat-es-Sultaneh pressed very hard for some more definite assurance, and asked what action we should afterwards take if Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai continued to postpone his attack until something definite had happened in Shiraz. I replied that Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai had already been guilty of hostile acts, but that it' he could finally show that he had taken no further action against us this would count in his favour. The foilawing day the Saulat- es-Sultaneh sent up to ask permission to go to a village about six miles from Abadeh, and there to discuss things with Mohammed Ali Khau Qashqai. As I w T as of the opinion that Saulat-es-Sultaneh would not join his brother Saulat-r ud-Dauleh against us, I consented. He never returned from this interview until he accompanied Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai to Abadeh. I am con vinced he went out with the genuine intention of working against his brother and for us, but that after his meeting with Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai he found reason to change his opinions. It was frequently reported on good evidence that at no time was he on good terms or in complete accord with the latter. I do not think that at any time he was inspired by a desire at to help on his brother’s plans, but apparently he saw in the situation prospects of bettering himself. °108 After communication with Shiraz was broken off on June 18th, the situa tion rapidly became worse. Rumours were rife every day as to Saulat-ud- Dauleh’s great successes and from no quarter was there any sign that the Government of Ears or the British were doing anything, or capable of doing anything, and no convincing contradiction of these rumours could be given. The notoriously pro-British Persian officers became seriously perturbed, though they still expressed the opinion that there was no fear of a rising of the S. P. It. I impressed on them the absolute necessity of discovering which, if any, Persian office!s were in communication with the Qashqais, and they assured me that they were not likely to spare any pains in that respect, as it was a matter of at least as much interest to them as to me. It was plainly to be seen that the long campaign of intrigue and propa ganda was having a most unsettling effect on the rank and file of the S. P. R., resulting in several desertions, including one cavalry patrol of ten men of which one man only returned. He reported that the N. C. O. in charge of the patrol (an old gendarme) had informed the men that it was now fcaulat-ud- Dauleh s day, the English were done for, and that anyone who stayed with them was a tool On June 19th Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai occupied the village of Amirabad, 10 m ilGs from Abadeh on the Abadeh-Surmaq road, with 60 to 80 men. The possibility of driving them cut was considered, but the village is a compact walled fort, and the results to be achieved did not justify askin 0 ' so difficult a task from the small mobile column at my disposal. The Deputy Governor, Atta-ud-Dauleh, up to this had shown his desire to help, but bad constantly complained that he could get no definite instructions from H. H. Earman Earma. He contented himself with publishing the messages received from the Governor General of Ears and the Cabinet, but as he said himself these messages were having very little effect as nothing was said m them about the dismissal or punishment of either Saulat-ud-Dauleh or Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai He continually suggested that I should publish a proclamation to the effect that as Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai wa» acting against the orders of the Persian Government, all his lands and proper ties were forfeited to the State. I replied that this was a matter for the Civil Government, and that he should put the suggestion up to the Governor-General. He was at first disposed to believe that the whole matter would be settled before it became really serious, but he became really anxious when he heard that tlie Qashqais were in Bagh-i-Janat, and after the interruption of commu nication with Shiraz he did nothing further to assist us or to maintain order or to re assure the people, his excuse being that he had no instructions. He would not even assist me in procuring supplies of w hich I w^as badly in need, although he made some pretence of doing so The Deputy Governor was in constant communication with Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai and up to the time when the wires to Shiraz w r ere cut, the tone of this correspondence w r as on the whole acrimonious, as Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai had been guilty of several acts of personal enmity against Atta-ud-Dauleh ; but after this several communica tions passed, the subject of which I was not made aware of. The Governor asked me to get, through the Minister at Tehran, an assur ance fiom the Cabinet that Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai w r as actin 0, against their orders, and that he was to be considered an outlaw. I replied that this was a matter for the Deputy Governor of Abadeh to represent direct to his own Government, but I sent a telegram to the Consul General at Ispahan pointin 0 * out to him the necessity of getting a re-assuring message from the Persian Government to the people of Abadeh. Probably as a result of this a wire was received by the Deputy Governor from the Minister of the Interior asking what was the cause of the disturbance at Abadeh, and telling him to take such steps as were necessary. This merely unsettled the Deputy Governor more. . He forwarded a copy of this telegram to Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai asking him what answer should be sent. Mohammed Ali Khan Qasbqai replied that he had his own instructions from the Persian Government, and forwarded a letter signed by seven or eight of the leading Mullahs of Shiraz, encouraging him m his patriotic work of destroying the S. P. R., which was an illegal force (Qusboon Ghair Rasmi). I immediately wired to the Consul eneral at Ispahan asking him to get, if possible, an assurance from the109 7CJ Persian Government that Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai was acting against their orders. An explanation is required from Atta-ud-Dauleh as to the part played by him and his tufangchis during the attack made by Mohammed All Khan Qashqai, which is dealt with more fully m part two of this report. The bad effect on the S. P. K, of the persistent campaign of intrigue, and t ne multitude of rumours as to the seriousness of the situation in Shiraz was daily becoming more obvious. An infantry outpost deserted complete witn arms and ammunition, and another attempted to desert. A second cavalry patrol deserted complete, and altogether there were 26 desertions m one week. All these went over to the enemy, where they were warmly receded as true patriots, and each received a tuman a day. It was realized how little hold we really had over the men and how little there was to which one could appeal. The majority of the men were Hyots from agricultural villages with no pride and no natural fighting instincts ; men who would always find it easy to reconcile their consciences to the less dan- gerous way As there were only four British officers to look after the tw regiments of S. P. B. and do all supply arrangements for the garrison, the men were inevitably left more in the hands of the Persian officers than was desirable. It was a handicap at this period that there was only one other British officer, Captain Williams, whose knowledge of Persian was sufficient to gain any direct information as to the feelings of the rank and file. The strain on all British officers throughout was considerable. Up to the date of Mohammed Ali Khan’s final attack on Abadeh we had not been able to discover that the rank and file had any hostile agams British officers, but it was far from evident that many of them could be relied on to serve us to the point of death. I did hope that they would have sufficient sense of duty and pride to defend their own barracks and lines. I therefore decided to let Mohammed Ah Khan Qashqai make the first attack, feeling sure that the force at his disposal would not seriously tax the defences. It is my opinion that at the time when Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai made his attack onlj a small proportion in each unit were aware of the intend ed treachery. The remainder had been thoroughly unsettled, and were in no frame of mind to put up much resistance. I think, however, that the plot had been prepared some time beforehand. The following instances are evidence of this :— A vakil bashi of the 3rd Cavalry, discharged by me early in May as an undesirable character and sent under escort out of Pars, joined^ up with Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai, and was one of the most active against us m the siege A man of the 3rd Cavalry (an old gendarme) granted two months leave to go to his home in Hamadan in April Mohammed Ah Khan £ sowars in the attack, and was connected with the murder of the loyal Persian officers A man called Akbar Kurchnli, a sowar of the 3rd cavalry who had been a vakil in the old gendarmerie, accompanied Sultan Seyed Jawad Khan as his servant to Tehran on leave in January, Sultan Seyed Jawad Khan was due back in April, but did not return. This man returned late in May with various excuses for the delay. He actually murdered Naib Abdullah Khan of the 3rd cavalry, a very pro-British officer, and there seems little doubt that he returned from Tehran with this mission. Appendix I.

Duggan, 3rd Infantry, S. P. R., consisted of one platoon, 16th Rajputs and 36 S. P? R*. Infantry together with Captain Townley, S. and T. Corps and one British N.-C. O., S. and T. Corps. Early in June, under instruction from Shiraz the S. P. R. at Dehbid was reduced from 80 to 36, so that the platoon 16th Rajputs might not be out numbered, in case of a mutiny at Dehbid. At the end of May one platoon 3rd Infantry, S. P. R., was distributed along the north road at the posts of Shuigistan, Yezdikhast and Aminabad but these posts were withdrawn being too weak to be any use in the circumstances. The buildings occupied by the S. P. R. all lay to the west of the town- They were considerably scattered and covered an area 900 yards by 500 yards. I had not sufficient strength to include the town in my defensive area, so decided to limit the perimeter to the defence of the S. P. R. buildings. The defensive perimeter was held by posts located as follows :— No. 1 sector :—16th Rajputs. O. C. Sector, Captain Laville Post : Ronaghleh {^Officer's mess and Sergeant's mess.) One Indian officer, 30 men and Lewis gun. S. F. R. hospital post. X Indian officer, 25 men. Remainder of Rajputs in Rajput Caravanserai. Detached Post :— Qaleh Nasrullah. —1 Persian officer, 25 men. r No. 2 Sector :—B. squadron 3rd Cavalry and 55 men 3rd Infantry. O. C. Sector Captain Winter. Post:— S. fy T. Ambar Fost. • Old C. squadron caravanserai post. D. squadron caravanserai. Mr hommed Ali Khan's garden. Salar Nizam's garden. No. 3 Sector :—A Squadron, 3rd Cavalry. O. C. Sector Captain Pettigrew. A squadron caravanserai. Telegraph office and cavalry Ambars. No. 4 Sector3rd Infantry O. C. Sector Captain N. M. Williams. Post:— Deputy Governor's tower. Qaleh Narangi. Infantry barracks.112 After finding garrisons for the posts 1 had a mobile column of 3 platoons infantry and 4. troops cavalry. I would have preferred not to use any of the Rajputs on the defensive perimeter, but the two posts occupied by them could not be entrusted to any one else, as they both commanded the Rajput caravanserai. The post in Salar Nizam’s garden was an undesirable extension of the perimeter, but the towers in this garden had to be kept out of the enemy’s hands. It was my intention to destroy them as soon as possible after hostilities began. In addition there were six outposts each consisting of one N.-C. 0. and 9 men of the 3rd Infantry commanding all roads through the gardens on the west, and the roads leading into the town on the east and south-east. On the north-east and north-west the ground is very open. North-west and west of the perimeter from the hospital to the S. &amp; T. Ambars there are walled vineyards with many trees. To the west and south of JMoliam.Qed AJi Riian s garden very open ground for four or five miles. To the south-east in the fore ground walled gardens and low buildings, but beyond 800 yards very open ground. The east face of the perimeter overlooked the town, the Qaleh Narangi and the Deputy Governor’s tower being commanding positions dominating everything within 300 yards to the east of them. The perimeter, though quite defensible by good troops against any attack likely to be made against it, had many undesirable features, having regard to the fighting qualities of the S. P. R. It was too extended and necessitated so many posts that at any one time only a small proportion of it could be made under the direct control of British officers. The S. t\ R. barracks at Abadeh were mostly isolated enclosures, which had been hired. There were too many covered approaches, and the field of fire, except to the north, south and south-east was bad. The Telegraph office w r as a weak spot, being commanded at short range by the roofs of some buildings in the bazar but these buildings were in their turn commanded completely by the Deputy Governor’s tower. The Rajputs caravanserai was an unsatisfactory position in the event of the S. P. R. turning against it, the south-western wall being under tire from the Qaleh Narangi; but any other position presented greater objections. Each post was prepared for all round ofifince, and this work ^was most efficiently carried out under the supervision of Captain Gwynne Griffith, R.E. attached S. P. R. Existing towers were repaired, loopholes improved and strong points built. All outposts were strong positions, defensible all round, and capable of putting up strong opposition to any hostile advance. Each post was stocked with flour and water for three days, and 150 rounds of ammunition per man, and it was a reasonable assumption that given a moderately determined resistance, no post would have had any difficulty in holding out for 24 hours, even if completely surrounded. I had first established four posts of Surmaqi tufangchis in villages watching the principal passes from the Sarhadd country, but when it became apparent that the inhabitants of those villages were hostile to us I withdrew the posts. The question of supplies was a matter of grave anxiety. I had on the 30th May flour for 40 days for the whole garrison, and only 10 days’ reserve of barley. The new barley crop was just being cut, and I was able to procure sufficient for daily needs. I hoped that I should be able to carry on until the new barley harvest was so far advanced as to allow me to commandeer sufficient for my requirements. There was no prospect of wheat being obtainable in Abadeh district until the beginning of July, but I had arranged for the im portation of 100 khavars from Jarguish. The first delivery of 20 khavars to be made on July 1st. I had, in addition, a reserve of one month’s supplies for British ranks and Indian troops.Assuming that the S. P. R, would be loyal I did not think that the force that Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai was likely to bring would be capable of closely investing Abadeh for any length of time. _ On or about May 27th, Muhammed Ali Khan Qashqai commenced col lecting the Sarhaddis at Khuskhizard, hut in spite of Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s urgent representations, made no move against Abadeh for some time. At length on June 7th he informed Saulat-es-Sultaneh that he could no longer disobey Saulat-ud-Dauleh’s instructions, and that, whether he was defeated or not, he must attempt an attack on Ahadeh. On the 8th he moved his force, which was then 500 to 600 strong to Mehradbegi, about 9 miles west by south of Abadeh. On the 9th his force started for Abadeh, but it is reported that about 200 refused to go, and the attack was given up, the force retiring on the follow ing day to Iqlid, 21 miles south-w r est of Abadeh. This he made his headquar ters till the 28th June, and from here his sowars raided the road and outlying villages, hut not until the 27th June did any of his armed men approach within five miles of Abadeh. S. P. R. patrols went out daily both mounted and dismounted, but except when led by British ranks could not be relied upon to act against small parties of hostile sowars. Large bodies led by British officers never succeeded in closing with the enemy. On Juno 27th the enemy occupied some of the villages close to Abadeh. I had foreseen that he Tvould do this preliminary to any attack, but owing to the thoroughly unreliable state of the S. P. R. at this time, and their obvious unwillingness to risk the open, I most unwillingly bad to abandon all thought of offensive operations, and had decided to allow’ Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai to make the first attack, hoping the S. P. R. would gain sufficient confidence from being behind walls, and wuth the very obvious duty before them of defending their ow r n barracks and quarters. Railing treachery I confidently expected Mohammed Ali Khan’s attack to fail. I anticipated he would attack by night, and would get into the towm, but as this was com manded to a large extent by posts on the eastern face, and having the movable column available for counter-attack, I did not think he would be able to establish himself there, Mohammed Ali Khan’s forces at this time consisted of about 800 men made up as follows :— Sarhaddis. 800 350 chiefly from the villages of Shahimian, Baghbacheh Dozehkhurd, Khuskhizard, Abbarik and possibly Assupas, under Mohammed Reza Khan, brother-in-law of Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai. 150—200 Kurshulis. 100—150 Iqlid’s and other villagers of Abadeh district. 150—200 Boerahmadis, said to be led by Mullah Gobad’s son. Also apparently a few Qashqai sowars sent by Saulat-ud-Dauleh. There were also many reports that a force of 300 to 500 Bakhtiaris were on their way down to help Mohammad Ali Khan Qashqai. The force was indifferently armed and short of ammunition. I anticipa ted that if Mohammad Ali Khan’s attack failed he would retire to Iqlid a*ain and there await reinforcements from the Saulat-ud-Dauleh and the Boerahmadis and Bakhtiaris. O n the 23th June some at least of Mohammed Ali Khan’s men moved from Iqlid to Chinar, and there seemed every probability that he would attack that nl ^tj? ? a , s ex P ec t e d that he w r ould use the village of Idrisabad, one mile west of Abadeh, as a “ jumping off ” ground for part of his attack, and an ambush of 25 S. P. R. under a Persian officer was laid after dark in the gardens south of that village. These, how ever, shortly returned after an imagi nary fight. b British officers slept at their posts, Captain Pettigrew and one British -Non-Commissioned Officer being in the telegraph oflace, and Captain Winter114, and one British Non-Commissioned Officer being in Mohammed Ali Khan’s garden I myself was in the Ronaghien (officers’ mess). About mid-night the enemy demonstrated against the south-west of the perimeter, i.e., Salar Nizam’s garden, and giving the password Raschid called on the garrison to let them in. Several deserters were recognized by their voices among the enemy at this point. This post was commanded by a loyal Persian officer, afterwards imprisoned by the rebels, and from his report it appears that the majority of his men were quite willing to fight on. Prom here the attack spread round to the east of the town. It was noticed that no tiring came from the outpos s on the east of the town, and at 2 a.m., a message was received from Captain Pettigrew that the enemy were on the roof of the bazaar above the telegraph office. This led me at once to suspect that there was something wrong with the post in the Deputy Governor’s tower. There were in the Deputy Governor’s house, in addition to the S. P. R. post, about 30 of the Deputy Governor’s men, whom the Deputy Governor had pledged his word, would assist in the defence. A Persian officer was sent down to investigate, and he returned with the report that he had been refused admittance, and that no firing was going on from the tower. I, therefore, sent Captain Williams with a party of 25 S. P. R. to endeavour to get possession of the tower. This party was fired at from the tower itself, but Captain Williams managed to reach the door of the Deputy Governor’s house, which he found barred. A voice inside told him to go away, as no one would be admitted. As this door could only be broken down with explosives or a very heavy battering ram, and as there was no doubt that whoever were in occupation of the tower, which is a particularly strong and well built one, were hostile, Captain Williams was forced to return. An explanation has not yet been received from the Deputy Governor. It is certain that his tufangchis did nothing to help us, and it is pVobable that they were actively against us. f ihe Persian officer in charge of this post was Sultan Latif Khan, brother of Sultan Kazim Khan, and one of the leaders of the rebels, but nothing definite is known as to his movements and actions that morning. A patrol was sent out wdiich reported the Sarhaddis in occupation of the town. Meanwhile the enemy were working round towards the Qaleh Narangi, and as no sounds of firing were heard from this place I became suspicious, and as a precaution moved the Lew is gun in the officers’ mess to a point where it commanded the Infantry barracks. One tower of these barracks, of which the door had been blocked up, commanded the Ronaghieh (officers’ mess), and although it was still dark some men could be plainly seen crawling towards that tow r e];* Almost immediately voices could be heard from the Qaleh Narangi calling to the S. P. R, in the Infantry barracks to help them, and to kill certain Persian officers. The presence of the Lewis gun checked any desire on the part of the garrison of the Infantry barracks to accede to this request. Heavy fire was opened from the Qaleh Narangi on the Ronaghieh and the Rajputs caravanserai, and the garrison in the caravanserai, under the command of Captain P. A. Laville, deserve great credit for their coolness when swept by heavy fire suddenly and at short range from an unexpected direction. There is also reason to believe that some of the S. P. R in the infantry barracks were firiug in the dark at the Indian garrison of the Rajputs caravanserai and the Sergeants’ mess. I had previously instructed Captain Laville to keep down the fire of the enemy in the vicinity of the Deputy Governor’s tower and on the roof of the bazar above the telegraph office with his Lewds gun. To do this the gun had to he placed in a position where it was exposed to enfilade fire from the Qaleh Narangi. The gun w r as maintained in this position for some time, sufficiently long to check any further advance of the enemy from the direction of the bazar. The enemy now closed in through the buildings east and south-east of the Rajput caravanserai, and a hot fight ensued at close quarters. About 5 a,m I received messages from Captains Winter and Pettigrew that all their posts were standing firm.115 Captain Pettigrew reported that his post in the telegraph office was . dominated by the enemy on the roof of the bazar, but that otherwise he was all I right. I sent for him to come up to the Ronaghieh as I wished to discuss with him the possibility of driving off the enemy from the roofs, using the local ^ reserves of “ A ” squadron for this purpose. About 6 a.m. 1 had suspicions that the infantry post in the S. and T- ambar was firing at the Rajputs. Captain Pettigrew and the British K. C. O- with him arrived about 7 a m. and Captain Winter arrived soon after, wounded } in the shoulder while going round his posts. He had tried to come back to the Ronaghieh through the S. P. R. post in Qaleh Nasrullah, but had been refused admittance. This led me to suspect that the majority of the 3rd In- fantry at least were against us. A squadron, 3rd Cavalry, were holding out at' 8 9 a.m., but a messenger sent down shortly after the squadron commander, $ Naib Abdullah Khan, was not allowed to approach, and was told that Naib M Abdullah Khan was not there. Other messengers failed to return, and I had ill little hope that squadron, 3rd Cavalry, w r ould remain loyal, as the Squadron ' Commander, Naib Haider Khan, was a relation of Sultan Kazim Khan. ^ A scout sent out reported about 11 a.m., that Mohammed Ali Khan’s t towers were in the hands of the enemy. This meant that the squadron had e gone over to the enemy. II About 11-30 am. some men of “ A’' squadron were seen leaving the cara vanserai, and there remained no further doubt that all the S. P. It. except those in the infantry barracks had deserted their posts and w r ere against us. Suffi cient information had not yet been obtained to give an accurate account of . what happened on that morning. It appears that for sometime after the enemy had established himself from the Qaleh Narangi to the bazar above the telegraph office, the outpost in Kal Parviz tow r er and the post in the telegraph office, stood firm. The O. C. the pest in Kal Parviz tow r er, Vakil Bashi Ibrahim * Mirza, 3rd Infantry, put up a most gallant fight for some time, but was appa rently inveigled out of his tower by some subterfuge, and foully murdered. It is not cl°ar what happened in the telegraph office, but the N. C. O. in charge of that post appears to have been in the plot, in spite of the fact that the bulk of the post fought loyally up to Captain Pettigrew r ’s departure. Shortly after Captain Pettigrew left the Sarhaddis appear to have entered the post. In “ A” squadron a small body of men, headed by Aspirant Abbas Khan, and some vakils of the old gendarmerie all of “ A ” squadron, together with Naib Mahsood Khan, S. and T. Corps, surrounded the loyal officers in the i squadron, Naib Abdullah Khan, Naib Hossan Aqa, and Aspirant Sufollah i Khan and murdered them. The \akil Bashi, also loyal who had gone to com- | municate with “ B” squadron, was murdered in the street. Their bodies were e most vindictively treated and badly mutilated, and were on view in the streets as a warning to all friends of the British. I believe that a considerable number of men in this squadron would have gladly remained loyal, but wffien their officers were killed they appear to have agreed temporarily to follow the others, and to have run aw r ay on the first opportunity. Shortly after the murder of the loyal officers the enemy entered the caravanserai without opposition. ' e In Mohammad Ali Khan’s garden, after Captain Winter’s departure, e tiie l )ost Commander, Regimental Vakil Bashi, Abbas Khan, 3rd Infantry, was* threatened by some of his owm men, who opened the doors as soon as the enemy appeared. There is little doubt that these men knew all about the plot beforehand. The Commander of the post in Salar Nizam’s garden, Aspirant Haider Khan, 3rd Cavalry, w r as arrested by his Squadron Commander, Naib Haider Khan, and the post appears to have put up no further resistance. The Qaleh Nasrullah w r as, I think, against us from the start, as were also the outposts east of the town, which allowed the enemy in without firing a shot, the only S. P. R. post w’hich the enemy really attacked were the outposts of Kal Parviz and the telegraph office. The other posts, though doino* much firing were not called on to do much fighting. I do not think that wdth the exception of the murdered officers and men, there were more than 5 casualties amongst the S. P. R. caused by the enemy.118 The enemy suffered some casualties from Kal Parviz tower and on the roof of the bazaar, and the Itajputs must have accounted for a fair number of both Sarhaddis and rebel S. V. E. during the day. Owing to the suspicious behaviour and unreliability of the S. P. E. in the infantry barracks, of whom there were nearly 200, it was decided to disarm the majority of those., and immediately to take over the barracks with a Eajput post, and also as I had previously decided to do in this eventuality, to vacate the hospital and Eajput caravanserai, and to transfer the garrison of those places to the Eonaghieh and the infantry barracks. This had many advantages and the disadvantage that the Eajput caravanserai allowed a covered way to withjfi 20 ft. of the Eonaghieh wall, and that an enterprising enemy might, from the high porch above the gate of the caravanserai, make things unpleasant for the posts on the wall of the Eonaghieh. All the S. P. E. except 15 who were considered to be above suspicion (but who had been disarmed a day or two later as they were a cause of constant anxiety to the Ptajputs) were disarmed by Captain Williams. A Eajput garri son of 20 immediately took over the infantry barracks, and the work 'of trans ferring the large quantity of stores from the Eajput caravanserai and Eonaghieh was begun at 2-30 p.m. This entailed very heavy work on all ranks, as there were to be carried over 230 boxes S. A. A. and 100 boxes specie, 50 boxes gun ammunition, besides a large quantity of wood, flour, etc. The enemy, whose activity had to a certain extent died down, but who continued sniping heavily, was apparently unaware of the work going on. By dusk everything of value had been carried over from the caravanserai and the hospital, with the exception of some rifles, which had to be abandoned as troops were too exhausted and had to be allowed some rest, in view of the probability of night attacks by the enemy. These rifles were burnt. The Persian sick, none of whom were serious, were left in the hospital. Shortly after dusk the bulk of the garrison of the caravanserai was transferred to the • infantry barracks, leaving only a post of 20 men, and the hospital post was withdrawn, after first destroying such wnrks as might be used by the enemy against us. xTlthough this post was only 300 yards from an enemv post the evacuation was not noticed. Such supplies as bhoosa, wood, etc , in the Eajput caravanserai as had not been got away were set fire to, and the post evacuated. The area held by us was now limited to that bounded by the three posts Eonaghieh, S.P.E. infantry barracks, and Sergeants’ mess. The weakest points in the perimeter were the south-west and south-east faces of the Eonaghieh, where an enemy could at any time mass within 50 yards, and the north-west face of the Sergeants’ mess, which was defended by frontal fire only, and 100 yards from which an enemy could mass unseen. The open space between the N. C, O. mess and Eonaghieh was at all times safe, and the field south-west and south of the N. C. O mess, tnough partly under sniping fire, was freely used by us. These two fields were invaluable for sanitary purposes. The water-supply inside the perimeter consisted of two small w r ells, and an under ground jube. The Eajput garrison in the Eonaghieh was now increased to 45 and one Lewis gun, and that in the Sergeants’ mess to 25. The remainder of the Eaj- puts were in the Infantry barracks under Captain Laville, the S.P.E. in the Infantry barracks being under the command of Captain Williams. At about mid-night on the 29th-30th, the enemy made an elaborate and cautious attack on the hosirital, shouting abuse freely to the Indian troops, who, they thought, were holding it. They occupied the building about 2 a.m! They made no further attack that night, but sniped heavily. On the following morning, the 30th, about 9 am. the enemy apparently discovered the Eajputs’ caravanserai had been evacuated, and a very bold attempt to attack through it was made by the Sarhaddis. This was so effectually checked and so heavily punished that the caravanserai w r as avoided by the enemy for the rest of the siege, except for a few abortive attempts to make sniping posts over the gate. Heavy snipin* continued throughout the day at from 50 to 200 yards range.117 About 3 p.m. a polite summons to surrender, promising us all good treatment, was brought in signed by Saulat-es-Sultaneh and Mohammed Ali Khan Qasliqai. A suitable reply was sent. During the night 30th June-lvst July the enemy collected in some num bers on the south-west of the Ronaghieh, from the hospital to the Rajput caravan serai. Several attempts were made to advance through the vineyards on the sou h-west. face of the Ronaghieh and a few men actually did reach the wall of the vineyard, ten feet from the Ronaghieh Flares were thrown by the garrison, but owing to the many trees and the dense undergrowth of the vines, did not help visibility much bat, as afterwards ascertained, caused considerable con sternation among the enemy. Bombs were also used, which had been made uo from jam tins. The enemy apparently suffered more than he liked in this attack, and after he had given up rhe attempt several wounded men were heard groaning in the vineyards. The enemy, with some gallantry, succeeded in getting these away. During daylight on the 1st July his activity was confined to sniping, and on the night lst-2nd July he again attempted an attack through the vine yard, but did not show the boldness of the previous night. The strain on the officers and men during these first four days had been continuous and severe, particularly on those holding the Ronaghieh. # The enemy were quiet during the day of the 2nd, hut about 4 p.m. it was noticed that the ground to the north-west of the infantry barracks was rapidly becoming flooded. The enemy nad appa ently turned all the jubes coming down to Abadeh from the north-west into one channel, as a very heavy head of water was coming down. A reconnaissance showed that the moat round the infantry barracks was nearly full. As the walls of the infantry barracks are mud the action of this heavy stream of water would soon have worn the foundations away. An attempt was first made to cut a channel to lead the water away from the infantry barracks, but tnis was prevented by heavy fire from the Qaleh Narangi 200 yards away. Captain GWynne Griffith, R.E., followed by Sergeant Barnes, made a reconnaissance under fire up the Isfahan road to discover where the banks of the jube had been cut. This was located at the elbow in the road 3 70 yards nortn-west of the Infantry barracks, and Captain GWynne Griffith, still under fire, gallantly attempted to mend the break. He was mortally wounded while attempting to do this, and died the * iYW.—This assistance was most gallantly same night. Assistance * having reached afforded bj Major Fraser hmiseif. p M g Sergeant Barnes the break was mended. During the night of the 2nd-3rd a bank was built and channels dm- across the north-west face of the Infantry barracks to prevent a repetition of the flooding. The enemy were extremely noisy all night, but attempted no action. 1 From information subsequently received it appears that about this date Mohammed Ah Khan Qashqai and some of the Sarhaddis died of cholera. The Saulat-es-Sultaneh removed from Abadeh to Jennatabad, 3 miles N. W. of Ronaghieh, and the Sarhaddis dispersed among the neighbouring villages some of them going off to their homes with what loot they had, and ^the remainder being with difficulty collected for any attack. From this date onwards the actions of the enemy lacked boldness and the strain on the garrison was reduced. On the 3rd-4th the majority of the S, P. R. in the infantry barracks beino* useless mouths to feed, weje paid off and sent out during the night leavin? only 7^ S. P. R. with us, including officers. These were retained for fatigues 0 sanitation, cookin g, etc., and of these 20 had deserted before the end of the smge. Of those discharged some went over to Sultan Kazim Khan, some were captured by him, and some went off to their homes. On the 2nd July three cases of cholera had appeared amongst the Rajputs and this was now a cause of very considerable anxiety, but thanks to* the strenuous efforts of the medical authorities, and the loyal way the officers and men earned out instructions, the outbreak was kept within most unexpectedly/ 118 small limits, the total number of cases up to the end of the siege being 8, of whom three died, including Sergt. E. EL. Battle, South Lancashire Regt. On July 3rd the enemy turned off the water-supply in the jube running through the Ronaghieh, and from this date the garrison was on strict water ration. On the night of the 5th inst the enemy produced a gun firing cylindrical leaden projectiles about S' 7 X 1$'. The range of the gun was about 600 yards. The shooting was inaccurate, and even when they hit the walls no damage was done, except when they struck a foot or two from the top. Until the 6th July the enemy contented himself with sniping and building new sangars and loopholes. On July the 7th the enemy again attempted an attack, on this occasion on a somewhat grander scale. About 10 p. m. a party of them collected in some buildings 100 yards N. W. of the Sergeants’ mess. Shortly after this it was discovered that they were again attempting to flood the neighbourhood of the Infantry barracks. Captain Williams who went out to make a reconnaissance reported that he considered the bunds required improving, and a working party of S. V. R., with 2 British N. C. Os covered by a small party of Rajputs, was sent to do this work. • This working party and covering party remained out for 2^ hours during the enemy’s attack, which was, however, not directed against that quarter. About mid-night the enemy became extremely active on the south-east and south-w est faces of the Ronaghieh. He dug his way through the wall 50 yards away from the south-east w all of the Ronaghieh. He began a bombardment from this wall of the south-east wall of the Ronaghieh, which w 7 as quite ineffectual, most of the shots going over Any intention he may have had of advancing through the w T all was stopped by xhe fire of the posts defending it. About 2-30. a. m. there was a considerable increase in activity to the north-west of the Sergeants’ mess, but here also he showed no liking for leaving the shelter of the walls and buildings, and by 3-30. a. m. the attack had completely died away. This w 7 as his last real attack, and from subsequent information it appears that after its failure Sultan Kazim Khan applied to the Saulat-es-Sultaneh requesting that the Sarhaddis be recalled, and it is known that about the 12th or 13th a message w 7 as sent by Saulat-es-Sultaneh to the Bakhtiaris for assist ance. On the night of 7th-8th the enemy w 7 ere heard digging in the houses 100 yards .north-west of the Sergeants’ mess. Scouts were sent out the following day and reported that the buildings had been loopholed. It was hoped that the enemy would return next night, and an ambush of six Rajputs w r as posted in the buildings but no enemy approached, and the ambush was replaced by a mine connected by a w ire with the Sergeants’ mess. On the 8th-9th continuous digging w r as heard from the direction of the out buildings west of the north-west corner of the Qaleh Narangi. It was suspected that the enemy w T as digging a mine shaft, using for this purpose Moghannis (Karez diggers), who are extremely efficient and rapid tunnellers. On 10th July counter sapping operations were commenced from the Ronaghieh and the infantry barracks and though the direction of the sap in Ronaghieh had twice to be changed it w as found Hrat after the relief of the garrison that the two saps which the enemy had made, one tow ards the Ronaghieh and one towards the Infantry barracks were in both cases within one yard of our counter-saps, and wmuld have inevitably have run into them if proceeded with. Erom this time onwards the enemy, though extremely noisy and abusive, took no offensive action, and appeared to be waiting for the completion of his mining operations. Several attempts w’ere made to locate his sap by scouts sent out at nieht with the idea of blowing it in, but the work was invariably stopped as soon as it grew dark. The house from which it w 7 as believed that these saps started had been loopholed and appeared to be held at night. On the night of the 14th-15th a successful raid was carried out against this house by six Rajputs, using 10 lbs. shells as bombs. One shell unfortunately exploded in a sepoy’s hand, wounding him in the face and hand. The remain ing shells exploded in the j ard of the house, and the party returned wuth onlyV 119 the above casualty. This raid caused marked alarm among the enemy, who fired wildly in all directions for some minutes. During the next two days the enemy was apparently making preparations for his next attack. All the gardens north-west and north-east were loopholed, and a report was received from an old woman that Qashqai sowars had entered the town. Various ruses were employed at night to ke^p the enemy’s nerves on the strain, and signs of his increasing demoralisation were so evident that it had been decided to attempt a raid on the Qaleh Narangi. On the night of the 16th-17th the enemy began with his usual noise about 9 p.m. Horses ■were heard trotting out of Abadeh to the north-west) and shortly after this all signs of activity on the part of the enemy died away. About mid-night a man approached the Sergeants’ mess post, calling out that he had a message from Bahadur-ed-Divan, Surmaqi. He was admitted and gave a verbal report that a column of 100 Indians with 8 guns had arrived at Surmaqi that evening, also that all gendarmes and Sarhaddis had left the town shortly after dark, saying that they were going to oppose the Belief Column. As this mail had nothing in writing I was not disposed to credit the story. But the arrival shortly afterwards of une of the loyal Persian officers who had been kept in prison by the rebels confirmed the report that the enemy had left the town. I immedi ately sent out a patrol to the Qaleh Narangi, and on receiving their report that this Avas empty, sent Lieutenant Baker and a post of Rajputs to take over the Deputy Governor’s tower. Shortly after dawn a force of cavalry, obviously not tribal horsemen, were seen moving along the hills to the west, and at approximately the same time the dust of a column was seen close to the hills on the east. About 6 a.m. heliographic communication was established with the Officer Commanding the Belief Column. The following information, in addition to that already mentioned, was obtained after the siege :— Ite control of the operations w 7 as in the hand of Sau 1 at-es-Sultaneh and Mohammed Ali Khan Qasnqai up to the time of the latter’s death, when for a few days Saulat es-Sultaneh controlled things himself, then handing over the direction of the military operations to Sultan Kazim Khan. These three, together with Sultan Latif Khan and Dabir-ud-Divan, father of Kazim Khan, called themselves the committee Nadiri, and this committee took over the Governorship of Abadeh, issuing orders and proclamations, levying fines on all those suspected of having made profit out of the S.P.B., collecting the malieh, and commandeering supplies. The Deputy Governor, Atta-ud-Dauleh, appears to have left Abadeh on the 4th or 5th day of the siege. Sultan Kazim Khan called his force of rebel gendarmes the 3rd regiment of the gendarmerie Gouvernmentale, and claimed that he had been promoted Yavar in that gendarmerie. He reverted to the Swedish procedure and organization, using the Swedish trumpet calls. The ringleaders of the rebellion were :— Sultan Kazim Khan, Sultan Latif Khan, Naib Haider Khan, Aspirant Abbas Khan, Aspirant Mahsud Khan, together with many of the vakils taken over from the Swedish gendarmerie. The officers loyal to us were :— Naib Abdullah Khan, Naib Hassan Aqa, Aspirant Saifullah Khan, all of 3rd Cavalry wffio were murdered by the rebels. Aspirant Haider Khan, 3rd Cavalry, imprisoned by the rebels. Sultan Ibraham Khan, 3rd Infantry. Naib Beza Khan, 3rd Infantry.120 1 j Naib Abdullah Khan, 3rd Infantry. Aspirant Seyed Agha } 3rd Infantry, clerical establishment. Aspirant Saifullah, 3rd Infantry, schoolmaster. Aspirant Hedayatullah Khan, 3rd cavalry, clerical establishment. Sultan Yusuf Khan, Fars Field Ambulance, all of whom were with us through the siege. And also possibly: — Aspirant Karim Khan, who died or w-as poisoned on the 3rd or 4th day of the siege, whilst in the hands of the rebels. The following casualties occurred during the siege British ranks. Captain G. D. M. Gwynne Griffith, RE., died of wounds. Sergeant E. II Battle. Died of cholera. Captain J- W. Winter wounded. Indian ranks .—Killed 2. Died of wounds 1. Wounded 7. (Sd.) W. A. K. FRASER, Bt. Major, Officer Commanding, Abadeh. Report on operations of the Abadeh Relief Column under Lieutenant=ColoneI V. P. B. Williams, O.C, Pars Brigade, S. P. R. . A , fc . 9 July 8th, 1918, a private of the 3rd Infantry, S. P. R., Abadeh, arnved m Slmaz bringing a message from Major W. A. K. Fraser, O. C. Abadeh. He had been detained several days near Abadeh as a prisoner, but md escaped and completed the journey from Abadeh to Shiraz in the extraordinary time of 4 days. The message was to the effect that Mohamed Ali Khan Qashqai had attacked Abadeh on the evening of the 28th June 1918, and that the majority ^ S amsou unf ^ e ^ the two ringleaders, Sultfans Kazim Khan and Datit Khan, had gone over to the enemy. That all pro-British S. P. R. officers and men had been murdered by the rebel S. P. R. Major Fraser, in putting forward the weakness of his position and the shortage of supplies, asked for immediate help to be sent. a • P?' jpk Juty 8aulat-ud-Dauleh had been defeated decisively. It was decided, therefore, to send a column in relief and to withdraw the isolated garrisons of both Abadeh and Dehbid to Shiraz. At 5-30 a.m. on the loth July 1918, the following force under mv command left Shiraz for Abadeh :— =&gt;7 2 Squadrons, Burma Mounted Rifles. 1 Section, Indian Mountain Artillery. 2 Companies, 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry. 1 Squadron, 2nd Cavalry, S. P. R. (90 strong). 2 Platoons, 4th Infantry, S. P. R. (80 strong). 1 Dressing station, Indian Field Ambulance. 1st Mule Corps, S. P. R. 10 Carts, Mule Cart Corps, S. P. R. As the news from Abadeh appeared to be alarming Abadeh by forced marches. The itinerary taken is shown in diary form: 1.^/^.. Shiraz to Whun. 22 miles. Heat intense. The road from Shiraz to Eaj i-Gab was blocked m 8 or 10 places. These places were mended, but caused considerable delay to the column. Bai-i-Gah caravanserai has been completely wrecked by Ali IChan’s men. I decided to reach121 A few shots were fired by some tufangchis in Baj-i-Gah at our scouts as they topped the pass, but it is not known who these tufangchis were as they quickly made off. There were three cases of heat-stroke, all of which recovered. Two ponies and three mules also died of locust poisoning. 2. July 11th. Sarghun to Saidun. —28 miles. I was met at Pul-i Khan bv Bahman Khan Piruzi, Naib of Tufangchis. I induced him to tell me where the balance of the supplies looted from Qavamubad, had been stored These are now r at Daulatabad, situated about 3 miles to the S E. of Pul-i-Khan. Several telegraph poles had been rooted up bodily and destroyed near Pul-i-Khan and the line generally w recked. TThen passing Puzeti-i-Takht-i-Jamshid, some 50 tufangchis belong ing to Nasrullah Khan Marjjidashti w r ere seen on the hills above the Nakzh-i-Bustam. They gave no trouble. The heat was again intense. From Saidun I wnote a letter to Atta-ud-Dauleh to say that I was proceeding to Abadeh with a strong column, and asked him to meet me at Surmak. I assured him that I would reinstate him as Deputy Governor, Abadeh, with all due respect and honour. 3. Jtdy 12th. Saidun to Saadatabad, —24 miles. At Sivand I got into telephonic communication with Debbid. News from Abadeh was disturbing and I was asked to hurry on as fast as possible. Eehbid reported all quiet. I engaged 278 hired mules at Sivand and w^as most fortunate in acquiring these animals. Transport for the removal of specie, ammunition, stores, etci^ from xlbadeh and Dehbid was constant cause of anxiety. I utilized these mules from Sivand onw r ards to mount the infantry. The heat was again very severe. ^ Several cases of heat-stroke occurred and one sepoy of the 3-124th Baluchistan Infantry died on the road. 4. July 13th, —'Saadatabad to Qadrabad, 19 miles. A report was received at Qadrabad that the enemy investing Abadeh numbered some €00 fighting men, who had been further reinforced by 120 Kuhgelus It appeared, therefore, imperative to hasten even more, in spite of the increasing number of sick. 5. July 14th, —Qadrabad to Dehbid, 29 miles. I found the Dehbid garrison perfectly secure. During the previous fort night the Arabs, headed by Meshedi Jani Khan, had openly threatened to attack this post.^ They had finally been kept from any hostile action by instructions received from Shiraz, presumably from His Excellence the Qavvam-ul-Mulk. Practically nothing was known at Dehbid about the state of Ahadeh. Several letters, written by Sultan Kazim Khan, to the loyal Persian officer in charge of the S. P. R. detachment at Dehbid, had been handed in voluntarily, but little information was obtained from these, as accounts of the successes of the rebel S P. B. at Abadeh were obviously exaggerated. I obtained 40 hired camels and a few r donkeys in Dehbid. 43 sick of all ranks had to be left at Dehbid and, in their place, I took 1 Indian Officer and 35 rank and file from the Dehbid detachment of the 16th Rajputs. 6. July loth, —Dehbid to Khan-i-Khurreh, 18 miles. Water at Khan-i-Khurreh had practically run dry and many animals had to go without. All ranks were put on fixed water ration. Bahadur-ud-Divan, brother of Hussain Khan, Deputy Governor of Surmaq, rode in that evening from Bidabida. He assured me that, thou° , h only 12 miles from Khan-i-Khurreh, no new 7 s had been heard of the arrival 'of my column. He also slated that the rebel S. P. R. and the Sarhaddis w 7 ere still in Abadeh investing the garrison in the officers’ mess building. A report was also received that seme 300 Bakhtiaris were actually on their way to Abadeh to assist Saulat-es-Sultaneh. J 7. July 16th, —Khan-i-Khurreh to Surmaq, 24 miles.122 ( 1 ) Hussein Khan, the Deputy Governor of Surmaq, was at Bidabida, hut fought shy of coming in to meet us. I was assured by everyone that our arrival was not expected, that Abadeh was still invested and that the enemy were still in the town. It seemed, therefore, justifiable to call on the troops to make one final effort in order to reach Abadeh by dawn on the 17th July. 8. Midnight July 16th-17th, —Surmaq to Abadeh—16 miles. On arrival at Ya’qubabad, 2-30 A m., I divided my force as follows :— (a) Two squadrons made up of 6 troops of Burma Mounted Bifles and 2 troops 2nd Cavalry S. P. B., the whole under the command of Major E H. S. Chapman. These went in a N. of W. direction, their objective being a point halfway between Bahman and Abadeh. Their orders were to close the country to fugitives to the west of Abadeh ; also to seize Soulat-es-Sultaneh who was reported to be in Jennatabad (1| miles N. W. of Abadeh). (b) Sixty of Bakadur-ud-Divan’s tufangchis, whom I had collected at Surmaq, were divided up equally on the Chinar-Abadeh road and the Surmaq-Abadeh main road, thus closing the southern exits from Abadeh. All cart transport was left in charge of Bahadur-ud-Divan at Ya’qu- babad. (c) The remainder of the column branched off from the main road in a northerly direction across country, hugging the hills on the east and thus avoiding the many villages to the east of the main road. My objective was to reach the small hills about 1^ miles to the east of Abadeh, known as the Imamzadeh Hills. The main column arrived in position at the appointed time (6 a.m., 17th July) without incident and the guns w r ere trained on the Kaleh Narangi, which was reported, to be Sultan Kazim Khan’s Headquarters. Almost simulta neously helio communication was established with Major Chapman on the west, who was in the exact position allotted to him. Just as the guns were about to open fire, helio flashes appeared from the Abadeh garrison in the jRonagkieh (officer’s mess). They reported that the enemy had fled during the night and that all was clear. It afterwards transpired that until quite late in the evening of the 16th Jthe arrival of the column at Surmaq had not been known by anyone. By the merest chance Sultan Kazim Khan, who had taken the revenue of Abadeh into his own hands, had sent three sowars to Surmaq on the evening of the J6th July to collect revenue from that place. Thus it w r as that he obtained new r s of our arrival and got six to eight hours’ start of the column. The troops under my command were absolutely exhausted and could not be called upon to follow him up. Furthermore nobody could tell me in which direction he had gone, Major Chapman reported all clear of the enemy on the west and at Jennatabad. The wffiole column then closed on Abadeh and encamped about miles to the north of the tow r n itself, since cholera was still raging in Abadeh. AH details and dispositions have been embodied in Major Fraser’s report. I will, therefore, not touch on this subject. A halt of six days was made at Abadeh to settle matters and re-establish some Kind of order. Steps were immediately taken to arrest those individuals who had been instrumental or implicated in the rising. The following arrests of importance were made :— azi—President of an Anti-British Committee in Abadeh. A virulent and consistent worker against the British. tnid-ul-Islam.—Brother of Qazi. Same remarks apply as in (1). ?rsian Telegraph Clerk—Constant intriguer against the Britisn and continually publishing false anti-British and pro-German iv incurs.123 (4) Agha Yasuf.—A member of Qazi’s Committee. Very anti-English and gave great assistance to Mohammed Ali Khan Qashqai, both in supplies and in helping him to spread, his propaganda. (5) Aga Hassan Khaleh—The most prominent supporter of Mohd. Ali Khan Qashqai in Abadeh. He made all the supply arrangements in Abadeh and surrounding villages for Mohd. Ali Khan Qashqai. He also assisted him in spreading his propaganda, particularly amongst the S. P It. (6) Naib Saifullah—Ambaidar (Quartermaster) to Mohd. Ali Khan Qashqai. Assisted him greatly in the traffic of arms. After wards “ officially ” appointed Quartermaster to Sultan Kazim Khan. (7) Dabir-ud-Diwan—Eather of Sultan Kazim Khan. During the siege attended all the meetings between Soulat-es-Sultaneh, Mohd. Ali Khan Qashqni and Sultan Kazim Khan. Several other minor arrests were made which were disposed of and are not worthy of note. The followdnsr ringleaders had fled and, unfortunately, escaped arrest. • (1) Saulat-es-Saltaneb. (2) Mohamed Eeza-- Brether-in-law' of Mohamed Ali Khan Qashqai. (3) Mirza Abdul Karim Khan Mu’avin-i-Maiieh.—This man is well known in the Gulf for his anti-British proclivities. He was turned out of all Gulf Ports by Sir Percy Cox. (4) Ali Asghar.—Virulently anti-British. During the siege all pro clamations by Saulat-es-Saltaneh and Sultan Kazim Khan were wnitten in this man’s handwriting (5) Mirza Mullah Jan Chinari.—One of the first to send tufangchis and supplies to Mohamed Ali Khan Qashqai. (6) Abdullah Idrisabadi.—Same remarks as in (5). (7) Ali Mohamed ) All of Iqlid. Helped Mohamed Ali Khan Qashqai (8) Agha Jan [ in every way and supplied him with all the (9) Beza Ghuli ) tufangchis they could raise. On Agha Yusuf 'and Agha Hassan Khaleh I imposed fines of tumans 2,000 and tumans 3,000, respectively, which amounts wpre speedily produced and they w 7 ere released. I devoted this money to paying compensation to individuals who had honestly suffered by remaining loyal to the S. P. B. and also for certain rewards. Naib Saifullah produced several Government rifles. At the request of Bahadur-ud-Diwan, he was released. Since he is a man who traffics in such disturbances, merely for the purpose of making money and not for political motives, he is always most useful to those who have the upper hand. Constant search parties were sent out, both in Abadeh and the surrounding villages, to recover Government property. These met with success, Over 50 S. P B. rifles and a quantity of equipment, saddlery and clothing were recovered. In addition, several horses were also recovered. The telegraph line had been badly cut and damaged between Surmaq and Abadeh and Abadeh and Shulgistan. It was repaired and communication with both Shiraz and Isfahan was established on July IBtli. It was, however, exceedingly difficult to get telegrams through to Shiraz. Very important communications were greatly delayed. The telegraph office at Abadeh had been completely wrecked and stripped of all instruments. There was absolutely nothing left. Lieutenant-Colonel Haig, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Isfahan, telephoned from Isfahan that the fact of the coming of the column to Abadeh had saved the situation at Isfahan which was most serious. Isfahan had been in danger from the Bakhtiaris, but, Murteza Ghuli Khan Bakhtiari, on hear ing of the arrival of the Abadeh column, bad fled from Isfahan. The whole situation had immediately changed for the better. 175 C. G. S.124 The situation in Abadeh and district was a difficult one. The Deputy Grovernor of Abadeh, Atta-ud-Dauleh, and his assistant Sam sun Nizam, did not comply with my request and return to meet me. Atta-ud-Dauleh had given no help to the garrison of Abadeh, when such help would have been invaluable Dis tuiangchis had even joined the enemy in one or two attacks against the officers mess. No man of any real importance lived anywhere near Abadeh. The Salar Nizam was at Abr Quh and did not venture near Abadeh. There was absolutely no doubt whatever that the whole district, with the one exception of Bahadur-ud-Diwan, had been actively hostile against us. Ba en the action of Hussein Khan, Deputy Governor of Surmaq, has been sus picious, or, at the best, non-committal. The entire district was in a chaotic state, and the difficulty remained of appointing someone to act as temporary Deputy Governor until the arrival of a permanent one. The necessity for this was clear as the Sarhaddis, who had retreated to Iqhd and their own villages, gave out that they were coming dowm on Abadeh again directly the column had leit. Saulat-es-oultanen had fled to Simarun and had joined the Darashuris who were looting and creating havoc generally. It now transpired that Aiyaz Kffika Khan and Ali Panah Kihka had come up with the Darashuris to the oarhadd about 10 days previously with instructions from the Saulat-ud-Dauleh to help in the destruction of the British at Abadeh. I anticipate trouble Irom the Darashuris as mentioned in my telegram R. C.-3, dated 21st Julv. Hussein Khan, son of Aiyaz Kihka Khan, is, 1 think, ut the bottom of most ol the trouble. Bepoits weie constantly coming in that Saulat-es-Saltaneh was trying to get hold of the Darashuris and Sarhaddis and. with the rebel S. P. B,., set himself up at Abadeh, separate from both the Saulat-ud-Dauleh and Sardar Bhtesham. Furthermore, 4 days before the arrival of the column, a man of the name of Seyed Khuda Karam Dozehkurdi had left Abadeh in' haste on a mission to the Bakhtiaris to enlist their help. The wffiole of Iqlid had k 6 *; 11 °P ei ^y hostile and appeared to be a serious menace both to Abadeh and Dehbid after the departure of the column. It w^as for this reason that I icquested permission to punish the Sarhaddis and Iqlid. Since this did not meet with approval, the necessity for appointing an acting Deputy Governor for Abadeh became all the more urgent. The only possible man who could in any way be trusted was Bahadur-ud- Diwan and, the fact that he had been literally the only man to declare openly lor us, was greatly in his lavour I therefore strongly recommended his appointment and sanction to this appointment was received on July 22nd. I did everything possible to strengthen him, I gave him 100 tufan°-ehis for Abadeh, 40 for Surmaq and 10 for Khan-i-Khurreh. For these he°was supplied with 105 Martini Bee Enfield rifles and 100 rounds of ammunition per rifle. In view of the fact that his tufangchis were engaged for probably dan gerous work and away from their villages, I was compelled to give them a higher rate of pay, i.e., Krans 95 per mensem, as for a Tabin in the S. P, IE It was only on this section of the road that I had to increase the tufangchis pay. Seyed Yadullah, Naib of Tufangchis Yezd-i-Khast Section, who had apparently remained neutral in the recent hostilities, was summoned to Abadeh. I left the road from Aminabad to Burj-i-Allah-ud-Douleh in his charge and paid his tufangchis up to date at the old rate. Abbas Khan of Dirghuk was allowed to retain charge of the road from Burj-i-Tarsah to Abadeh and his tufangchis were paid up to date at the old rate. The attitude of Abbas Khan throughout had been doubtful but there had qeen nothing really definite against him. His jealousy of Bahadur-ud-Diwan and a few doubtful acts on his part during the time I was in Abadeh made me decidedly uneasy about this man. I therefore brought his son to Shiraz with me as a guarantee for his good behaviour.] 25 All business in Abadeh was naturally at a standstill, but, after tbe first two days, the inhabitants were persuaded to return to, or come out from, their houses and carry on their ordinary work. I issued a proclamatipn that business could be carried on as usual and men go about their work without fear. A piquet was placed in the town to prevent disturbances. As it was ascertained that every single village in the vicinity of Abadeh had actively helped against us, I made .Abadeh and^ the surrounding districts support the whole column and the Abadeh garrison in supplies, free of charge, during my stay there. The greater quantity of supplies was demanded from those villages which hid been the worst offenders. The probability of the Darashuris, Sarhaddis and the rebel S. P. R. coming down on Abadeh after the departure of the column, demanded some action. Bahadur-ud-Diwan, as my departure drew near w r as getting nervous and looked as if he would throw up the sponge. I, therefore, wrote letters to Aiyaz Kihka Khan and Ali Panah Kihka, Darashuris, and to aU the Sarhaddis, giving them a very strong warning, I also posted up proclamations in the town and surrounding villages. These letters, together with a useful sum of money for “ expenses ” finally lulled Bahadur-ud-Diwan s fears. Fur thermore a reward of 500 tumans for Sultan Kazem Khan and 400 tumans for Sultan Latif Khan, dead or alive, was posted up everywhere. That the above had the desired effect is, to a great extent, proved by the fact that, up-to-date, telegraphic communication is still open with the north. Mirza Jafar Khan, Rais-i-Malieh at Abadeh, had been drawn into the general stream against us, a weak and insignificant man, who might well be changed. His main object seemed to be to get out of Abadeh as soon as pos sible. This I w r ould not allow 7 since he was the only Government official left. He now awaits further orders His presence in Abadeh was necessary, as Sultan Kazem Khan had taken all the revenue into his own hands during the siege. All documents for the Malieh had been signed by Sultan Kazem Khan with designation “ Committee of Nadir.’' I have not yet been able to discover the exact aims and intentions of this “ Nadiri ” Committee. The Sheikh-ul-Islam, son of Imam Jum’eh, came into Abadeh the day before I left. There was no convincing proof forthcoming to show exactly w hat part he had taken in tbe disturbances, but he had certainly no intention, at any time, of helping us Dealings with him in the past had shown him to be somewhat anti-British and an obstructionist generally. A dangerous and avaricious man whose disappointment at never having received money from us was apparent. Being a son of Imam Jum’eh, a mullah of the highest and most respected reputation, it was a problem to know how 7 to deal with bim. Time was short as the column w 7 as leaving Abadeh the following morning. It was a case of either arresting and deporting him or trying to win him over to help Bahadur-ud-Diw an. I chose tbe latter course and backed it up by a present of money, the only inducement which would appeal to him. Bahadur-ud-Diwan appeared much satisfied with this arrangement. The appointment of Bahadur-ud-Diwan is only a stop-gap and may not answer for long. Throughout my dealings in clearing up the situation at Abadeh, I took particular pains to w ork in such a way that our evacuation did not appear in the nature of a retreat. On July 23rd, Captain Bulatzel with 100 Persian Cossacks, one Mountain Gun and two Machine Guns, arrived from Isfahan. This Russian officer informed me that tbe situation in Isfahan a few days before he left (* e., prior to the receipt in Isfahan of the news of tbe approach of the Abadeh Relief Column) had been most serious and that the Consul and British Colony were preparing to evacuate Isfahan. He further stated that they had been daily expecting the same trouble to happen in the Persian Cossack Brigade as had happened in the S. P. R.126 a T3 °o ? U ’^, 2 ^ th ^ ?? lu , m , n ’ augmented by 3 platoons, 16 th Eajpatsand S. J . lv. details from tlie Abadeh garrison, left Abadeh for Dehbid. -, K a n0t b t ei1 ab ! e to Collect much trans P 01 ’t in Abadeh beyond about 150 donkey?. Nevertheless I was able to remove all bank and other specie (over 100 boxes), about 220 boxes '303 ammunition, 385 rounds 10-pr. cun ammunition and ; 41 rifles and carbines, 108 bolts M. L. E. and 128 bolts Mauser carbine. The only stores of any importance left were some 130 saddles which are not urgently required, and a few unimportant Government stores and supplies. Ihese I left m charge of Bahadur-ud-Diwan with complete lists He will remove these stores to Surmaq as opportunity offers and from thence to Dehbid. Brom Dehbid Aman-ullah Khan has orders to forward them to fetnraz. Some 200 bags of atta had been emptied for defence purposes. This atta 1 handed over to Bahadur-ud-Diwan to do with as he liked, as it was of no use to us. c^ 011 ! th &gt; e 26tb July tbe colu . m ? arrived at Dehbid without incident. On July 27tn a halt was made at Dehbid in order to make arrangements for the evacua tion of that place.- Again a few donkeys only were forthcominc in the wav of transport. J The Arabs, in spite of the letter which the Qavam had sent up by hand of his Mamoor ordering his tribes and raiyat to help us, gave us no assistance whatever. 1, thereiore, summoned into Dehbid the three leading Kalantars namely :— ° * Yadullah (Farsi). Sayad Khan (Shiri). Agha Nur-ullah (Tribe same name). As a result of this interview, I certainly think that, had I been able to stay a little longer at Dehbid, 1 would have been helped more in the matter of transport. I warned them very strongly about robbing, as their action lately had caused a very adverse impression and warned them for the future of the inadvisability of incurring the anger and displeasure of those in authority Their coming in to see me had, I think, a good effect since I hear that their tribes are now behaving decidedly better. IMeshedi Jani Khan could not come and see me as he was at Arsinjan. His nephew, Sad-ullah, wrote me a very friendly letter saying he was busy with tribal affairs and could meet me at a certain time which, however, did not fit in with my movements. It is an item of some interest that a section of the Farsi tribe are thinking of re-building the village of Banak and settling down there as raiyats. 6 The S. P. R. detachment at Dehbid had remained loyal throughout and had given no trouble whatsoever. Aman-ullah Khan, Deputy Governor of Dehbid, during the recent troubles, had been guilty of no act which could prove his attitude as anything approach ing hostile to us. Although in my opinion he was hedging the wFole time, yet the fact that tne stretch of road had been kept in good order during the whole period, is to his credit, the most noticeable point being that the telegraph line through his territory had not been tampered with. ° I, therefore, paid all his tufangchis up-to-date and allowed him 132 tufangchis for the future for guarding the road from Quli Kush to Dida»un. These tufangchis are divided up as follows :— Quli Kush 19, Dehbid 48. Kaleh Murcheh 20. Khan-i-Khengan 20. Didagun 25. All the supplies in the caravanserai at Dehbid were handed over to the charge of Aman-ullah Khan. Both Bahdaur-ud-Diwan and Amanullah Khan have been instructed by me to send in weekly reports of all happenincr S i n their districts.19.7 On July 28th the column, increased by the Indian and S. P. R. detach ments of the Dehbid garrison, left Dehbid for Shiraz. On arrival at Qactrabaa on the morning of the 29th July, I sent on a troop of 2nd Cavalry, k- P* •» to arrest Meshedi Hussein Ali, Naib of tufangchis at Qadrabad, but unfortu nately he had fled away the day previously with all his belongings. This man is the father-in-law of Aspirant Mahsud Khan, one of the ringleaders ot the rebel Abadeh, S. P. R. Both Meshedi Hussein Ali and his son-in-law had joined Atta Khan Kalantar of the Kurshulis. I may add that this tribe seem to have gone completely “ yaghi ” and appeals to be a haven for many of the rebel S. r. K. The floors of the house of Meshedi Hussein Ali were dug up and one box of bank specie was discovered. This I_ am handing over together with the balance of the fines already mentioned in this report. On July 31st the column arrived safely at Sivand. The Naib of tafangchis, Mohamed Hussein, was arrested by me and has been brought into Shiraz. He assisted in the capture of Qavamabad post and received a good share of the loot. The tufangchis, therefore, at both Qadrabad and Sivand have to he discharged. It w T as my intention to give the charge of the road from Qadrabad to Sivand inclusive to Be-Izzad Khan of Saadatabad. I have taken great pains to ascertain the attitude of this particular man during the recent ^ disturbances, and I find that he gave no trouble and showed no signs of hostility against us. It was greatly to his credit that he did not join Khambaz Khan and Nasr-ullah Khan in the capture and looting of Qavamabad. I have brought Be-Izzad Khan with me into Shiraz with the object of settling up the back pay of his tufangchis and also arranging the disposition for the new tufangchis. On leaving Sivand on the 1st August, I sent hack a troop of S. P. R. Cavalry to arrest Hassan Khan, the Naib of Qavamabad, who had taken part in the capture and looting of Qavamabad. He himself had fled, but much Government clothing was found in his house, I have reported fully the charges against Nas-rullah Khan Marvdashti, Khambaz Khan (Beni Abdul Lohi) and Mehkaram (Labu Haji) in the Marvdasht plain. According to instructions received at Sivand, I left them alone. Bahman Khan Piruzi met me at Sivand. Since he appears to have done as much as circumstances would allow him during the recent troubles, I decided to retain his services as Naib of tufangchis and to allow him to maintain the same number of tufangchis to guard the road from the Takht-i-Taus to Pul-i-Khan. Bahman Khan was also brought into Shiraz to settle up his accounts and make new arrangements. On August 2nd the column arrived at Zarghun. Since my departure from Zarghun to Abadeh on July 11th, the quarters of the British ranks in the S. P. R. caravanserai had been much damaged and the walls completely spoiled with charcoal drawings and disparaging writings about the English. I arrested Lutfullah Khan, Kalantar of Zarghun, firstly because he had been instrumental in betraying the S. P. R. post at Zarghun to Ali Khan when the latter was at Baj-i-Gah, and, secondly, for allowing the caravanserai to be damaged to the extent it was. I recommend that he should be severely dealt with and a new Kalantar appointed. I think he is a servant of Mahmood Khan, son of Sahib Diwan, and, ipso factOy an enemy to British interests. On August 3rd the column left Zarghun and arrived safely in Shiraz the same morning. In my new dispositions of tufangchis, it was my intention to ask that H. H. Barman Parma should take charge of Zarghun. Since my arrival in Shiraz, however, it bas been decided that he should take charge of the north 175 C G. S.road and I have, therefore, informed H. B. M.’s Consul, Shiraz, of all arrange ments I have made. ° Everybody knows and let it be known that our sole and only purpose of giving om Irves is to make our brethren alive and release them from the chains of captivity. As our enemy’s purpose is to take over our country and do awav with our religion. The above has been proved by their actions to you all. On their first step they changed our language, and instead of saying the drills in .Persian they taught us all in English which is against our holy religion. They began to buy supplies with the dearest price and so causing the rest ot tne people to starve, and for the cost of the supplies they gave us paper and nothing else, i.e., notes. The last thing which proved that they do not desire our progress was the looting of the bazaars after which they vacated and escaped for Shiraz because they were afraid of our column. O my brethren; O Persian nation, your prophet said “ Patriotism rises from your icligion, WEat has become of you and what has happened that for a few shais you have sold your country, your religion and your nationality. Awake; awake from this long sleep and see yourselves with the chains you are bound with, because in a short time you will go to nothing. To assure you I write to you that we simply want to go for our country and we do not want to loot our own brethren. We want to go after the column of the enemy and clear them out of Persia. I assure you everyone of you to attend your work as nobody will do anything to you.

Inspector General, South Persia Rifles. Sir, I have the pleasure to recommend Subadar Major Ali Dost Khan (who was my companion on this journey) as a man of excellent character and bravery. His wisdom in fighting matters and his good behaviour made me obliged to write you this letter of recommendation for him. Besides his excellent conduct, I found him very intelligent, and a man of experience and bravery. He was with me during the fighting and proved to be far more able than had been expected. He is a remarkable officer and a man of great ability, the quality of which is undoubtedly known to you. (Sd.) IBBAHIM, QAVYAM-UL-MTfLK. Note by General State. From various independent sources it is evident that the success of these operations in pursuit of Soulat-ed-Douleh were chiefly due to the Qavvam-ul- Mulk and to Subadar Major Ali Dost, who, in close co-operation, insisted on a vigorous pursuit being maintained by the Qashqais under Sardar Ehtesham and by the Arabs under Qavvam-ul-Mulk. G. P. GRANT, Lieut.-Col., General Staff. THE PURSUIT OF SAULAT-UD-DAULEH. 15th July 1918 — Leaving Shiraz on the afternoon of the 15th July 1918, we marched five miles and arrived safely at Kushan that night. Having slept there at night we left Kushan for Ab Band-i-Siakh (or Sangar-i-Ali Khan) which was our second stage. 16th July 1918 — After marching 16 miles we arrived at Ab Band-i-Siakh. During the march nothing occurred. Some Kashguli tribes were seen at Ak Chasmeh, who were going up to their Sarhadd. There were numerous tents of the Kashguli tribes and they had more than 15,000 sheep and goats. We passed our time comfortably this night and on the following day, after a march of 8 miles, arrived at Badinjun. 17th July 1918 — Before we reached Badinjun, Sardar Ehtesham and Salar Heshmat received us at a distance of 3 miles outside the village. During the evening we were engaged in machine gun and artillery practice, the results of which were good. 18th July 1918-~ Badinjun —We halted here one day and made all necessary arrangements and inspected the men, animals and baggage. We left at this place all the unnecessary and heavy baggage and had a long conference on fighting matters and made a number of plans for our fight against the enemy. ^ H. E. the Qavvam, after an inspection, ordered the Chiefs to commence their roll-call and to count the fighting men. The summary was :— H. E. Qavvam’s men...1,000 of whom 800 were armed. 1 gun, Sardar Ehtesham’s men...700 of whom 650 w T ere armed.130 Yavar Mokd. Taghi Khan...2 guns and 2 machine guns S. P. R. Mokd. Ali Khan, men...700 of whom 450 were armed. Taking special precaution we ordered our men to carry 5 days’ rations, and, as there was no good “ barbardari ” arrangements in the jungle, we were in need of help ; Hadi Khan Kashguli helped us much in this matter. mh July 1918— Haying made our plans we settled that the Ilkhani and Mohd. Ali Khan Kashguli, with all their Qashqais, should push forward to attack the Soulat. In the morning His Excellency the Qavvam ordered the Ilkhani and Mohammad Ali Khan to go as far as Chinar-i-Mishan and then to attack the enemy at Shurab pass and capture it. His Excellency himself also left Badinjun at 3 p.m., on the same day and arrived at Chinar-i-Mishaun after sunset. The distance between these two places was 6 miles. It was reported that the enemy’s patrols were coming to Shurab to take up a position on the Shurab pass. 20th July 1918— In the morning all the Qashqai fighting men were sent to Shurab as an advanced guard under the command of Ali Khan and the remaining men advanced under the command of His Excellency as the main body. On arrival at Shurab it was reported that an enemy patrol, numbering 40 sowars, was there, and when they saw us descending the pass they retreated to Kara Dashi j)ass and Gusaleh Kandi (or Darinjan Ear). It was also reported that the enemy had occupied Kara Dashi pass —Gusaleh Kandi—Darinjan Ear, and Soulat with his 700 men w'as in Gulsaleh Kandi. There were also 200 men of the enemy at Kara Dashi and 500 at Gudari Mukh (Tang-i*Muk). At this time His Excellency the Qavvam called Mohammad Ali Khan and myself to make a plan to attack the enemy. It was decided that Mohammad Ali Khan with his men should make a surprise attack and capture Kara Dashi. To follow this plan, His Excellency and I had determined not to give the enemy any chance to collect many men at Kara Dashi, and also to mislead the the enemy so that he might think we w r ere going to Khajai in order to surround him from three directions. The result of this plan was that after a fight of 20 minutes the enemy were defeated and the positions were captured at G-30 p.m. We saw 10 dead left on the field ; w e captured 7 prisoners, 17 rifles and many cartridges. During this action 5 or 6 of the enemy fell down the hill and perished, it being so dark that they could not find their path in the mountains. Saulat’s men had kindled a fire on the top of the mountain of Tang-i- Gusaleh Kandi. 21st July 1918 — On the following morning the Qashqais and the two South Persia Rifles* machine guns, pushed forwurd in rear of the advanced guard, and went as far as Gusaleh Kandi and Khajai. There was no enemy in the valley. Mohammad Ali Khan pursued the enemy from Khajai to Tang-i-Halalu ^and captured 13 rifles w hich the enemy had stolen and carried to their camp. Being defeated the enemy left his last position and fled away, and thus we returned to Khajai. The distance between Halalu and Khajai was nearly 20 miles. In order to blind the Saulat in both eyes, we arranged that Salar Heshmat (Ali Khan, brother of Sardar Ehtesham Ilkhani of the Qashqai) should start for Eiruzabad by the Maimand road to the east, and also he should be enabled to make the tribes go back to the Sarhadd, i.e., tow ards Ardakan and Abadeh. The result of this plan was also satisfactory.FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.131 22nd July 1918 — We left this stage for Javakan which we reached after a march of 2 miles. Here we saw the Saulat’s men bad kindled fires on the tops of the mountains round the Halalu pass. 23rd July 1918— Early in the morning we left this stage for Halalu pass (or Tang-i-Tangab). On this day Sardar Ehtesham, in command of the Arabs with 2 guns and 1 South Persia Rifles machine gun, pushed forward as advanced guard, and the Arabs under the command of His Excellency the Qavvam followed in rear . It was 8 a.m., when our advanced guard arrHed near Gelak and when v e reached them they were engaged in fighting, and Gelak fort and our No. 1 trench were occupied by the Kashkuiis ' The enemy seemed to be very strong at that time; he had 1,400 men and the advanced guard did not attack him until the main body with His Excellency the Qavvam came up. We advanced towards Gelak fort as previously arranged and at this stage His Excellency opened fire with his gun, the result of which was excellent. Gelak is marked on the map. Casualties. Enemy’s casualties were :— Dead found on the field .... Total killed ..... Wounded Our casualties were Killed— Men ...... Horses • . . . • » • Wounded— Men ....... Missing— Men ...... SUMMARY OE ATTACK ON 23rd J JLY 1918 AND CAPTURE OE EIRUZABAD. 23rd July 1918 — On the 23rd we commenced attacking the enemy as follows :—First we captured No. 1 position which was situated between Gelak fort and Tang-i- Tangab. This trench was captured by the Kashkuiis. The second trench was then occupied by the enemy, and we captured that also. It extended from Tang-i-Tangab to Khavid fort, a distance of 2 miles. There -was a river which ran across a field and the enemy’s position was on the southern side of this river. After we had captured the first position we stationed our troops on the northern side of the river. Now the distance between our line and the following places, which are marked on the map, was 700—900 yards. We had to capture the extreme point of the enemy’s line named Khavid, and then we had to attack the enemy’s last positions, viz., Bagh-i-Shah, Qdleh Sari Maidan, Dehi Tuli Haji, Qaleh Tuli Haji Gukun and finally Eiruzabad. The enemy’s last positions were very strong ; thus we had to attack some of the above places by means of artillery fire, and our men had to push forward under cover of this artillery fire. 11 40 7 3 12 19 5132 The Qavvam and I went to the guns and began firing and our men mean while advanced. Having captured Khavid, they advanced as far as Bagh- Sbah. The result of this action was satisfactory; our men defeated the enemy, the left wing of which was broken. In this action one of the South Persia Bifles’ yakils was slightly wounded, but we captured all the enemy’s positions in the evening. The enemy also had one gun which he was firing, but on the same night the enemy ran away. 24th July 1918 — We entered Piruzabad on the 24th and occupied it without firing a shot. Putting outposts in the captured positions we fixed our Headquarters in Saulat’s garden. Saulat had left behind the following :— Tents. . . . . .70 Ammunition boxes (gun) . . 4 „ (rifle) . . 12 Large quantity of wheat and barley. Had we not attacked and captured these enemy positions on the 23rd we should have been obliged to prolong our fighting; for on the same day 100 Hashtistanis had come to help Saulat and another 200 men were expected to reach him on the 24th. We were also short of rations.%/ &amp; INDIA OFFICE LIBRARY and RECORDS Photocopying record Ref.
