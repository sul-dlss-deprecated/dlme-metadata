Walton, Esq. , C.B. , M.C., India Office, S.W.l. t: */&gt;/* My dear Walton, In confirmation of ray telephone conversation with you this afternoon. / We have had a letter from our management in Abadan raising the question as to whether avoidable suspicion may not be aroused with the Trucial Coast Shaikhs if we delay any notification to them ox the change in the situation pending the delivery to them of a letter of introduction from us by Holmes. Having regard to the delay which from our discussions yesterday is likely, beyond that previously anticipated by Skliros, to take place in a direct contact between Holmes and these Shaikhs, I think it is on the whole v r • better that Abadan should at an early date write to each of the Shaikhs concerned. individual Shaikhs of the contemplated negotiations by P.C.L. we think that in the altered circumstances of the anticipated delay in the inauguration of negotiations between Major Holmes and the Shaikhs it would on the whole oe better for you to notify them in the near future oi tne livelihood of these discussions. It seems in a high degree improbable that even if negotiations between P.C.L. and the ,a .:vhs have to be delayed for a time owing to discussions at this end as to procedure. Major Holmes will abstain from communication with the Shaikhs, and in such circumstances it may lead to less suspicion if we also notify them. The intructions we have given them read as follov/s: “As regards a coraraunication from us to theWe suggest that the notification should include a statement that the approval by His Majesty’s Government of the agreement into which we have entered is under consideration in London, and that meanwhile discussions have taken place between London Principabs and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a British company of standing and repute in which we are partners, regarding the exploration and contingent exploitation of the Shaikh’s territories. These discussions have been carried on with the knowledge of H.M.G., and we are awaiting the approval of H.M.G. to direct discussions between Petroleum Concessions Ltd., who have nominated as their representative Major Holmes, whom they understand to be well known throughout the Persian ’5 Gulf, and the particular Excellency to whom the letter is being addressed. We trust that when these discussions take place they may eventuate in mutually satisfactory results, and in the meantime we shall continue to have the pleasure of paying the monthly sums agreed. We anticipate that in due course the Excellency will receive confirmation of the position from the Political Resident. The procedure we have indicated above has the approval of the India Office, subject to your prior consultation with the Political Resident.*' Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) L.Lefroy.u Al.l.

(2) That in view of the recent developments and the need for discussions between the various Government Departments concerned before authority is given to P.C.L. to go ahead with negotiations, there is likely to be some delay. (3) That in the altered circumstances and because of the anticipated delay, it would be advisable for us to address a letter to the Shaikhs notifying them of these new circumstances. (4) That we should leave It to you to decide whether . the present options should be approved by H.M.G. now or« at a later date and at the same time as you notify the Shaikhs of H.M.G 1 s approval of negotiations by P.C.L. (5) That the above procedure has the approval of the India Office. ' Since the receipt of the above instructions, Arnold, my assistant in these matters, has met Holmes in Basrah and between them they have drawn up the enclosed draft of a setter which, if you approve, we now propose to address to each oi the Shaikhs. 3 With regard to point (4) above, my own opinion is that the ShaikSs^sHould be notified as soon as possible of H.M.G s approval of our present options and before, we advise tnem oi the existence of P.C.L.( S ) Jkgr ^ ' However I believe there is a possibility of your visiting Kuwait in the near future and I know that Holmes is particularly anxious to see you, so perhaps, if you are going, yon would kindly advise me so that I may send Arnold down to discuss these matters with you.

Shaikh should be informed that Petroleum Concessions Limited having asked His Majesty's Government for permission to approach Kis Excellency with a view to negotia ting for unallotted area on basis of draft concession submitted have been informed that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to their doing so. Presumably Holmes will require to approach Shaikh through Political Agent in the first instance but having done so might conduct detailed negotiations direct while keeping Political Agent informed of their progress. 4. MUSCAT* There is no objection to Company approaching Sultan. 5. TRUCIAL SHAIKHDOMS . When question of option has been disposed of (see my telegram No.832 dated 7th March) there is /is no objection to Holmes opening negotiations with Shaikhs whom he would invite to Bahrain for the purpose• He should make his first approach to them through Political Agent, who should be kept in close touch with progress of negotiations. The preliminary conclusions have been reached at this stage on questions of (1) boundaries (2) protection. As regards (l) it will be sufficient at this stage to define areas of concession as those of respective Shaikhdoms without annexed maps but eventually it will be desirable to define boundary so far as possible and His Majesty’s Government accordingly suggest that Resident should take steps as soon as possible to enquire into boundaries of various Shaikhdoms inter se and vis a vis Muscat. question of boundary between Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia would depend on course of negotiations with Ibn Saud. As regards (2) His Majesty’s Government are inclined to view that so far as possible all responsibility for protection should be placed by concession agreement on Shaikhs themselves (compare Article 15 of draft concessions and condition (c) attached to approval of option) but provision could also be made in political agreements and in accompanying exchange of letters between Government and Shaikhs concerned that any movement of Company’s employeed, entailing special risks (e.g. penetration xxt for more than a certain distance into the hinterland) should be subject to prior written permission of Shaikh, who would thus be responsible for saying where Company could operate and consequently (in the event of any incident occurring) for taking all possible action against the culprits and paying any compensation which His Majesty’s Government might consider necessary. • As regards Bahrain, Trucial Shaikhdoms and Muscat 1 we / 6we should emphasize both to Holmes and Rulers concerned in informing them of permission to start negotiations that no concession can be finally concluded without specific further approval of His Majesty^ Government who would require Company to enter into separate political agreements with them* 7 # Please see separate telegram regarding Kuwait Neutral Zone* l should be glad of your and Resident’s concurrence or observations on the above proposals.

Mr. Arnold said that it had been sent to their agent in Sharjah for distribution by the air mail after it was written. I said that I knew that the Residents idea had been first to communicate to the Shaikhs the approval of His Majesty’s Government to the options and to get their guarantee for the protection of working parties and for the payment of compensation in the event of trouble, and that I knew that the Resident had approached them on^iis recent tour. Mr.Arnold reverted to this later, and asked whether any harm had been done by sending the letter (which had been done on the orders of their Company at Home). I said that it was possible that hs.rm might not ensue but that with people like the Trucial Shaikhs it was necessary to present one idea at a time to them and that if they received the Company’s letter before they had made up their minds abouat giving the undertaking regarding protec tion they might well start making difficulties. I said in the course of the conversation that I was anxious that they should discuss the matter of the Trucial Coast with the Resident.AM.

Holmes, who was mainly responsible for the wording of the draft of a letter to be addressed to the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, a copy of which I sent to you for approval, was definitely of the opinion that the present options were to be transferred. It seemed also from your letter,in which you w^rite on page 2 tT I note that it is not apparently proposed to make any formal transfer of the existing options to P.C.L His Majesty’s Government have, however, approved of the transfer of the options, subject to P.C.L. accepting the conditions attached to them, wnich the P.C.L. have done” - that you were also under the im pression that the options w r ere to be transferred. /fvn 2.44-S earlier as I London have now advised me, however, that this is not the case and that the present options are not to be transferred to the P.C.L. I am sorry that I have added to the confusion, but I hope that when Holmes and Arnold have seen you in Bahrein on or about the 24th all doubtful points will have been cleared up. Arnold is going down to Bahrein by air on the 22nd and he is taking this letter with him. I was pleased to note from yourletter No.149-S that you consider Tunb Island to be covered by the option which2 we have obtained from the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, and I agree that the matter might be left for Holmes to discuss with the Shaikh when he goes down.

Holmes and Arnold arrived at Bushire late on the evening of the btn April and Holmes left at 10.30 on the morning of the 6th, so there was not much time for discussion as far as Holmes was concerned. However, we covered the ground fairly thoroughly. I am sending copies of this letter together with all the enclosures to Metcalfe and with the relevant enclosures to de Gaury, Loch and Watts.TRUCIAL COAST. 1 1 # I explained to Ma^or Holmes and Mr. Arnold that one of the important points with regard to P.C.L. operations in this area was that the Shaikhs should agree to Condition (c) - protection of Company's employees and surveying parties (vide Government of India telegram No.766 of 24th March 3936 to the India Office). While the concession areas at Kuwait and Bahrain were safe, the same was not the case along the Trucial Coast where the various Shaikhs exercise practically no control over the Beduoin in the interior, and that therefore some such clause was necessary. On my recent tour along the Coast, I^had given letters to the Shaikhs concerned, asking them to agree to this clause. Should any Shaikh refuse to agree then obviously he did not feal himself able to afford proper protection to the employees of the Company and the Company therefore would not operate in his area. I thought,however, that the Shaikhs would agree to the clause sooner or later, and in the meantime I did not think it necessary to hold up Major H.'s negotiations with these Shaikhs pending their reply. I woulcimerely write to the Shaikhs pointing out to them that r unless they did agree to Condition (c) His Majesty's Govern- \ ment wouldnot sanction the grant of any option or concession.

Muscat agreement would no doubt follow similar lines, though question of having separate Ohiei Local Representative for Muscat may arise. It will no doubt be simplest to conclude in respect of each Sheikhdom a separate agreement of a common form, similar to the Qatar Agreement, in which the following alterations appear to be necessary. ( a ) Paragraph 1. Substitute for opening words '’The Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh shall not be transferred (b) Paragraph 2, Omit up to first comma. ( c ) Paragraph 4. Substitute 'The Company shall deal with the authorities through a chief local representative in the Persian Gulf who shall be a British subject.

( d ) Paragraph 5. Substitute 'subject to the terms of the Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh, the Company undertakes at all times to pay due deference to the wishes of the Sheikh and to the advice of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and of the Political Officers subordinate to him', (e) Paragraph 6. (i) In the Trucial draft add at the end 'and to any instructions which may be issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf', (ii) in the Bahrein draft substitute new article 'Any right given to the Company under its Agreement with the Sheikh to utilise means of transport by air shall be subject to the provisions of the Air Navigation Regulations in force in Bahrein'. (**) Paragraph 8, Add at the end 'or their Agent'. (g) Paragraph 9. It will be necessary to insert a refinery paragraph in each Agreement which will cover the whole area. This will need careful wording; the following is suggested as first draft, but will in any case be subject to observations by Admiralty and negotiation with Company. 'The Company declare that it*(Continuation Sheet.)

If and when this total production is achieved, the Company agrees to consult with His Majesty’s Government as to the 'best location for a refinery. (h) A clause to the effect that any movements of the Company’s employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetration for more than a certain distance away from the coast) should he subject to the prior written permission of the Sheikh. (in connexion with this, provision should be made for placing, so far as possible, on the Sheikh’s responsibility for protection of the employees and property of the Company; such provision could be included in the letters to be exchanged with the Sheikhs at the time of the conclusion of the ’’political” {agreements with the Company, and might be to the effect that in the event of any incident occurring, the Sheikh would take all possible action against the culprits and pay any compensation which His Majesty's Government might consider necessary). 4.

The way will then be open to Major Holmes* (2) Major Holmes will be required to keep in close touch with the Political Agent, Bahrain, and keep him informed of the progress ofthe negotiations* (3) Ho concession can, of course, be finally con- -cluded wi thout the specific further approval of His Majesty’s Government, who will require the Company to enter into a separate H Political M agreement with them. (4) It will be sufficient at this s tage to define the boundaries of the concessions as those of the res- -pective ohaikhdoms without attempting to prepare maps. 15) As regards the protection of the Company’s employees, in the event of a concession being obtained and operated, responsibility will fall on the Shaikh concerned. as a corollary of this, it is proposed to include in the '•Political , ‘ agreement a clause to the effect that any movements of employees entailing special risks (e.g. penetrations for more than a certain distance from the coast) should be subject to the prior written permission of the Shaikh* 4* I shall be sending you a separate letter on the question of the “Refinery clause 5 Y/e shall now be taking in hand the drafts of t he rt political a greements' 1 andwillsend you these in due course.

It Is nov; nearly fiye months since I first addressed the India Office on the subject of the v?ish of Petroleum Concessions Limited to apuly for concessions in the Persian Oul 4 *. I realise that the Persian Gulf is a region ^hi ch pre sents problems requiring special consideration from a number of different departments. On the other hand, it is also a region ^he re the uorkin^ year has to be compressed into the eifcht months October to May, a nri there is some danger that if a decision is too Ions delayed, it rcill be impossible to start negotiations with anv of ty,e Pulers in that pert of thp world until next October, and so a whole season will be lost. % f On looking? through tHe correspondence attain I see that in your omcial letter P.Z.8Pfj6/36 of the IPth December Inst you stated there there would be no objection to our applying for concessions t 0 tiie Shaikh of Bahrain and to the Sultan of Muscat on the understanding that any concessions granted would be subject to the conditions which would be embodied in separate agreements between P.C.L. and H.M's Government. And in your d.o. P*Z-9314/35 dated 14th *Ianuarv to Lefrov you referred to the anxiety of the Sultan of Muscat to have a thorough oil survey carried out in his State and enquired if the A.I.O.C. or P.C.L. were intending to open negotiations with the Sultan in the near future of the 3(?th In my letter ot the 30th «Tanuary I have given an undertaking on behalf of P.C.L. to accept in respect of all the proposed concessions conditions similar to those accepted '^ton RBq.

In the circumstances if I could have an earlv decision not-only in respect of Bahrain (as promised in your letter of the 5th March) but also in respect o^ Muscat, I could telegraph to Major Holmes and tell him to negotiate a concession with the Shaikh of Bahrain, and thereafter proceed to Muscat to fix up the Mus cat concession and then proceed to Aden to consult Colonel Lake with a view to nef?otiatinp a concession with the Imam of Yemen. that *he present season would not have been altogether wasted. I should add that the option obtained bv the A.I.O.C. over Has al Khaimah expires on the 31 st July 1937 , © nd that over Bubai on the 18 th October 1937, so we shall find ourselves with onlv one working season in ’tfiich to send peolofrical survey parties to these areas and to negotiate lon^r-term concessions finery in each of the areas over which it may obtain a concession. ?he points raised in your letter ^. 2 -^ 59/36 dated '’hat would leave Kuwait and the Crucial Coast areas to be dealt with next season, but would at least ensure but I suppose that that cannot be helped.

Dear Mr.Walton, I gather that the translation of the various option r* l '“' ' obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. into long term iHrWHlHAWWWHrAMI* « concessions v^ill not be plain sailing. The A.I.O.C. report • r ■ _ ^^... •vj, t*t+yj;nrA *% a certain restlessness on the part of the Shaikhs concerned ■ niummunrn iirmriT' i ■■ i■ ** w f w»*w ■ v ■+ •*/'- 0 Au:/*tvnn^gi^rir r• ' tj • ia 1 ' -. ipt at our inaction in respect of geological surveys, etc., since the options were obtained, and, in consequence, a distrust of fresh negotiations for an extension ox such options lest these should lead to a further period of inactivity. Moreover, the Shaikhs would like to be given some idea of the oil value of their territories before embarking upon fresh negotiations relative thereto. In these circumstances I am proposing to send out two British Geologists to do some reconnaissance work towards the end of the year, and to open at Bahrein in September, or October, a central office for all the Trucial Coast work. The most likely man I have on the staff for appointment as Manager of this central office is Mr.E.Y. Packer, M.B.E., who has served the Iraq Petroleum Co* as representative at Amman (Transjordan) during the past four years. I enclose copy of the particulars of himself which he submitted when he applied for employment; I took up references and found them very good; I can confirm that his service v/ith the I.P.C. has been entirely satisfactory; my first choice has fallen on him because of the smooth relations which he has established with the Arabs ofTransjordan with whom he is in favour. In compliance with n\y promise to obtain your prior approval to the nomination of the Local Manager, would you kindly cause enquiries to be made in regard to the suitability of Mr.Packer as a tactful liaison man, and let me know if I may confirm the appointment. I feel sure that the British Resident at Amman, Colonel Cox, will give him a good chit. In regard to the reconnaissance work to be undertaken by the Geologists, they will be instructed to observe such restriction of movement as will be laid down by the Political Resident.

'f With reference to India Office express letter No* P.Z*B078/36/^ated the 3rd April 1936 and your tele- gram No. 37(yaated the 12th May 1936 I have the honour to state that paragraph 2 of the India Office express letter under reference raises the question of a separate Chief liocal Representative for Muscat. Geographical considerations coupled with the volume of w r ork which will have to be dealt with on the Trucial Coast make the appointment of a separate Chief Local Representative for Muscat essential. If a separate Chief Local Representative is appointed it will be necessary to alter the wording of paragraph 4 of the proposed agree ment - suggested in paragraph 3(c) of the India Office express letter referred to above. 2. In paragraph 3(g) of the India Office express letter under reference the tern ’'area* is used (page 3 line 3). The term refers to the whole of the Trucial Coast and Bahrain except of course that part of Bahrain The natural conclusion from the -wording of this paragraph already leased to the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited is/I *sO is that only one Company will operate in the area and that Con^any will be Petroleum Concessions Limited. From Major Holmes f letter dated the 7th / 1936 addressed to the Ruler of Bahrain, which form ed an enclosure to iqy letter No. C/224-10/12 dated the 9th May 1936, (paragraph!. Article 23, sixth line) it seems that Petroleum Concessions Limited will transfer the rights in the concessions to subsidiary companies which will be called Petroleum Concession (Dubai) Limited, etcetera. If subsidiary conpanies are formed there may possibly be confusion between the *area fl worked by the —■ .. ..-''Petroleum ■ . Subsidiary, say fedrasi Concession (Dubai) Limited, and the total •area* for which Petroleum Concessions Limited obtained concessions. In view of the fact that the building of a refinery will probably depend on the output of the 'area* I suggest that this point be considered before the form of this paragraph is finally decided upon. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. Officiating Political Agent, Bahrain.itflll-.o. Article 23* There is no question of transferring the Agreement to a third party. Petroleum Concessions Limited intend to form a Company to take care of each Concession obtained, the Company so formed would be financed from within Petroleum Concessions Limited. The Company in this instance would be called Petroleum Concession ^Bahrain) Limited, controlled and operated by Petroleum Concessions limited. However I will bring the question before the London Office of Petroleum Concessions Limited, and if I received from the Bahrain Government Offices the exact wording and form that Your Excellency desires this Article to have, I will forward that also to the London Office.

PETROLEUM C0NCESSI0R3 LIMITED CITY-GATE HOUSE FINSBURY SQUARE LONDON E.C.2. Dear ICr. ralton, 5th May, 1936. I should hare acknowledged before the receipt of your letter P.2.20/8/36 dated the 2nd A.pril f in which you stated that there would be no objection to negotiations being started with the Trucial Coast Chiefs, subject to certain conditions. Uj Board has recently appointed Mr.S.H.Longrigg to be General Manager of the Company, and Mr.Longrigg left here on Friday last for Cairo, to meet Major Holmes and to discuss the situation generally with him. I have now received from Kr.Longrigg the following telegram:- 'WILL INDIA OFFICE NOW INSTRUCT BUSHXUE THAT HOLMES MAY OPEN CONCESSION NEGOTIATIONS WITH PIRATE COAST AREA ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT RESPONSIBLE PARTY HAS SIGNED OR UNDOUBTEDLY WILL SIGN PROTECTION CLAUSE”. I gather from this telegram that the steps indicated in Clause (l) of paragraph 3 of your letter have been duly taken, but that there is some doubt whether Major Holmes may proceed to open negotiations with the Chiefs until the 'Political' Agreement referred to in Clauses (3) and (5) of that paragraph has been signed. if a telegram could Major Holmes may be anticipation of the referred to.

CITY-GATE HOUSE, FINSBURY SQUARE, LONDON, E.C. 2. 14th May 1936. Dear Mr.Y/alton, In confirmation of our conversation this morning, I am suggesting to Major Holmes the insertion in each of the Trucial Coast Draft Concessions of an Article designed to cover the position which would arise in the case of an inter se dispute 'between two of the Shaikhs (or possibly between one of the Shaikhs and a semi-independent inlying tribe). There is no doubt that in such an event we might find ourselves quite unable to proceed, and although the suggested solution involves invoking the good offices of the Political Resident over what might be far from an easy matter, I cannot think of any other way, and you yourself this morning seemed sympathetic to this suggestion. Would some such formula as the following meet the case? ’’The Shaikh agrees that, in the event of a difference of opinion between him and any other ruler or authority as to whether a given place or district is properly to be considered as within his territory or in that of the other ruler or authority, he will accept without reservation the decision of the Political Resident on this matter, and will, in so far as lies in his power, prevemt the existence of the &amp;lton Esq., C.B., M.C. , dispute/ H.a Office, Whitehall. 3.W.1#© 14 ' 2 . dispute from affecting adversely the operations of the Company in any manner. The Company similarly agrees without reservation to accept such decision”. If, as you suggested, the Political Resident is able to progress towards an official definition of the respective areas, this would, of course, make it much less likely that we should have to have recourse to the suggested Article.

Also enclosed are copies of the proposed draft concessions for Abu Dhabi (ff 6-22), Dibai (ff 22-37), Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah.Further correspondence regarding the question of negotiations and concessions is included between Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai and the Political Agent at Bahrain (Percy Gordon Loch) regarding the Shaikh’s request that Hajji ‘Abdullah Williamson accompany any surveying parties visit his territory; and his concern over the inactivity of the D’Arcy Exploration Company with regards to their two year option and subsequent reluctance to discuss any extension to the option until surveying had commenced.The volume also contains correspondence between representatives of the India Office (John Walton, Maurice Clauson), the Director of Petroleum Concessions Limited (John Skliros) and representatives of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (Langlois Massy Lefroy, Edward Henry Ommaney Elkington) discussing potential boundary issues with regard to the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s territories; the need for a special risks clause should any Company employees wish to visit or survey the interior of some of the Trucial Shaikhdoms; the procedure to be followed for Major Holmes to be permitted to commence his negotiations; and discussions around the draft concession agreements presented to the India Office and possible requirements to be included in a political agreement between the British Government and PCL.Also included in the volume are:correspondence between Sir Andrew Ryan, HM Minister at Jedda, and George Rendel of the Foreign Office explaining the Red Line Agreement, which was concluded in 1928, including the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Iraq Petroleum Company’s expectations under it and that the Kuwait Neutral Zone was not considered to be part of Kuwait proper and was therefore included within the agreement; reports submitted by the Residency Agent at Sharjah (Abdur Razzaq) to the Political Agent at Bahrain on the movements of Frank Holmes and his agents (Muhammad Yateem, Ashrif Halim) on the Trucial Coast including details of their visits to the various Shaikhs, and the topics discussed with them where known; the agreement that Petroleum Concessions Limited could open negotiations with the Shaikh of Bahrain (Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah) for a concession in the unalloted portion of Bahrain, and guarantees made by Major Frank Holmes to the Shaikh of Bahrain that PCL had no intention of transferring any potential concession to a third party but would exploit it through a subsidiary company which would most likely be named Petroleum Concessions (Bahrain) Limited; the proposal by Petroleum Concessions Limited to appoint Ernest Vincent Packer as Local Manager for PCL at Bahrain, and follow up of Packer’s references by the India Office; correspondence around the potential need for a separate Local representative to be appointed for Muscat should any concession be granted there, as the geographic area and expected workload would be too much if the local representative at Bahrain was expected to be responsible for both the Trucial Coast and Muscat.The draft concession agreements and correspondence to and from the Trucial Coast Shaikhs is in Arabic and English; the letter-head for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company is in Persian and English.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 237-243.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>D'Arcy Exploration Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ra's al-Khaymah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ajman, Āl Nu'aymī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Dibai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Geographical exploration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000287#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
