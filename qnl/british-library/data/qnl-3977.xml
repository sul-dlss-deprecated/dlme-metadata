Location of small garrison would entail locking up of troops for no adequate reason. We therefore suggest that the question of occupation be deferred.Copy Oct 29th 1916 Confidential &amp; Inunedia te My daer Plade t Mr Chamberlain desires m to enquire whether, in the probable event of war with Persia, there would be any immediate advantage in seizing the Persian Gulf Islands, and hoisting the flag having in view the fhet that we cannot supnly garrisons.
