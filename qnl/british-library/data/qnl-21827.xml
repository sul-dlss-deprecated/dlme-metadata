I have consulted the Bahrain Government on this matter and their view is that this is a matter extraneous to the protection of Production and Refinery installations in Bahrain. They hold, and I am inclined to agree, that if the Company feel that night watchmen are required for the jetty and fore shore the Company might themselves provide them.

The Company were rather too ready at first to describe almost any employee as indispensable but one cannot really blame them as the prospects of getting men back from leave, or new men as replacements then seemed doubtful. 3* Other protective points in Manama are being reasonably well cared for, and it will need quite considerable ingenuity and determination for a saboteur to wreck the power plant or Cable and Wireless for instance. 4. Letters went off on the 3rd September to the Shaikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast demanding their co-operation in war in terms previously approved, and they have all acknow ledged these letters suitably. The Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah following the Bahrain example have offered their •’resources 11 against the common foe ’. Howes has arrived, as you know, and went down by the slow mail to Sharjah on the 10th October with instructions to visit all the Shaikhs and establish friendly contacts with them and other important people. I have told him to leave the ordinary routine work to the Hesidency Agent, through whom I will deal with any un pleasantnesses there may be, and to regard himself solely as a messenger of goodwill for the time being. He may even be able to visit places like Baraimi and the Abu Dhabi Liwa, but I have instructed him not to press the idea if there is the slightest sign of disinclination on the part of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. I hope too that he may be able to establish contact with Shaikh Mohammad bin Ali al Huwaidin of the Beni Kitab /4- Kitab, but he has been told to go very slowly and carefully about this. 5. To return to Bahrain. I advised the Bahrain Government to impose price control on essential foodstuffs before the war broke out and this was a very popular move# The Bahrain Govern ment* s order of course did not strictly apply to foreign mer chants f but the latter were not sure of this and in point of fact there have only bt*en two prosecutions so far against foreign dealers in foodstuffs. I need not tell you exactly what section of law I found to apply to these people before our own food control regulation was issued t The Bahrain Government have ordered seme 30,000 bags of rice which are now on their way and will be kept as a reserve in case of need# The order actually went off before war broke out when we were not quite sure whether the B.I.S#N. ships would continue to function regularly# The export of 'meat on the hoof' from Arabia having been stopped, arrangements have been made to ensure the continuance of an adequate supply from another country whose Customs offidials are susceptible to inducement to keep their eyes shut. So far there has been no rise in the price of meat except the normal rise which comes with the approach of Ramadhan. As for other articles of household use we have been working out rather carefully means to stop the profiteering which has occurred already and I hope to put these plans into operation in a few days' time# One advantage of war is that one certainly learns a great deal about the bazaar which one never knew before. We ftave had to go slowly over this business of controlling prices of articles other than foodstuffs since it is clearly essential not to antagonise the merchants overmuch, if only because they know a good deal more about their business than I do and would unquestionably evade any rules which cut their profits too severely. Byard has been putting in a great deal of work on this problem and has been most useful-5- 6* We had of course an unofficial censorship working before war broke out though I am bound to admit that we found nothing very interesting. Most of the 'interesting* letters did not go by post at all in the past but were carried by hand. Now that we have a regulation enabling us to stop this we are discovering what an enormous quantity of mail was carried by passengers on ships, by nakhudas, dhow hands and so on. Meanwhile we have opened a c ensorship office and are censoring correspondence on lines which you approved before you left here. The main conclusion I have reached so far is that the Bahrain Post Office must be exceedingly profitable, judging by the enormous volume of correspondence passing through it. 7. Apart from other activities in regard to publicity and sc on which need not be detailed here, we are trying to make preparations for the day when the Bahrain Volunteer Defence Force is inaugurated. Classes of instruction in the use of the service rifle have been opened in the Oil Camp and Coates is doing good work instructing about 60 Europeans. I am at present awaiting the arrival of Training Manuals for the Vickers Berthier gun and when they come we will have V.B. classes for European personnel at Awali also. For the i Bahrain Police, an Indian N.C.O. machine gun instructor has arrived and is getting on very well with the help of Ranee. The old police rifle range is unsafe for machine guns and a new one is now being prepared. 8. Meanwhile more predictive activities have not been neglected. The Oil Company ©re already doing geophysical work in the shoal areas around the Fasht al Jarim north of Manama; and investigation of the possibility of a cement industry in — Bahrain continues.

I was stopped by one who pointed his rifle directly at me. I mildly reprimanded him and told him it was not the correct way to hault a person. He appeared to see the point. However, on my return some minutes later, I was again stopped by the second of the two, and the rifle was again aimed directly at my person.

( HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S POLITICAL BAHREIN. 4 * Dear Sir, As foreshadowed in various conversations, we now find ourselves in the position of being shorthanded in all departments. At the same time the internal defence at the Refinery has been tightened up and on all shifts there is a second Shift Foreman who spends part time on the internal patrol of this area. An examination of the defense problem there has been made and we can, by reducing the number of staff men on the Cate to one per shift, maintain the same degree of moderate security against sabotage at the Refinery as under the present system by having him released by the second Shift Foreman while he goes his rounds in the Patrol car. As we find it impossible to maintain the Refinery/p—^ in full operation and, at the same time, keep two men at the Refinery Cate, this procedure is being adopted at once*L—- In the field area, Mr. Belgrave has found it necessary to reduce the number in each camel patrol section to four and has eliminated the daylight camel patrol. It is presumed that he has already communicated this decision to you. Yours very truly, J..

I gather that he fears in particular the possibility that Iran may attempt to seize Bahrain and that he suggests the construction of forts with guns to cover the approaches to the harbour. Certain utterances in the Iranian Press not long ago may well have increased his natural suspicion of Iran. 5. If the matter is broached by Shaikh •Abdullah before I receive a reply to this letter, I wiU listen to all that he has to say and answer that I will report it to you. It would, however, be convenient if I could be given an indication of whether or not I shoul: encourage Shaikh * Abdullah in his attitude with the idea of getting the Bahrain Government to co-operste in any measures that may be deemed necessary. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Bahrain.4 - 2 - (2) # The Naval Base for the Peraian tfulf Division, which formerly used to be at Henjam, is no# at Bahrain. (3) .(a). At Bahrain there is no# a large Oilfield employing some 300 Europeans, and turning out some 100,000 tons of crude oil a month. A refinery will shortly be working there, after which - if the quality of the oil comes up to standard - the Sloops of the Persian Gulf Division would be able, if necessary, to procure their fuel from Bahrain instead of having to depend on Abadan. The advantage of having an oil supply, whether for the immediate needs of the Sloops or for further afield, in a British protected State like Bahrain as well as one in a foreign country, i.e. Iran, is obvious. In case of war, with Iran neutral our oil supplies from Abadan might be difficult, and with Iran as an enemy might conceivably cease altogether, at any rate for a time. (b) # In Kuwait and 'iatar there are potential Oilfields, the possibilities of which are being explored, and perhaps others on the Trucial Coast, and in Muscat terriiToty. (4) .(a). Cables run as follows: Fao to Bushire - two lines. Bus hire to Bahrain. Bahrain to Jask. Jask to Muscat-Karachi. (b). At Bahrain there is a public wireless station, and at Sharjah an Imperial Airways wireless station whichalso does commercial traf f ic /traffic connecting with ''Vahrain. (51 • r n past years there was no Naval or Military Power in the Peraiam &lt;!ulf area except that of Sreat Britain. There is now an Iranian Army, Navy and Air Force, an Iraqi Arruy and Air Force, and a more or leas consolidated 'Jaudi Arabia. /e are of courae on friendly terms with Iran and P&gt;audi Arabia, and have a Treaty of Alliance with Iraq, but in apite of this I do not suppose that the grovth of military power by States surround ing the uulf area can be entirely disregarded. Incidentally Iran lays claim to Bahrain, though of late she has let this claim lie dormant. (6). There are no defences in any of the Arab Shaixndoms. If we were at war the Bnaikhdoms wo :ld algo be in a similar position on our side, and the lulers would certainly co-operate with us to the best of their power, but have no military forces at their disposal, except some 1£&gt;0 armed police in Bahrain and a similar number of Levies in Muscat. ^• All the above points are of course obvious enough, and doubtless the Naval, Military and Air Force Authorities concerned have given due consideration to the defence of the f aulf in case of war, but perhaps you might think it worth while to pass on a copy of this letter to Arrqy Headquarters, and Dalton might like to do the same to the Cornuittee of Imperial Defence. * I am sending copies of this letcer to V/alton, Butler/ 3Butler (Senior Naval Officer), Mitchell, Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq, de Gaury, Loch and ^ a 11 s • Yours sincerely, sd.

On two or three occasions recently when I have had conversations with His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa, or with Shaikh Abdullah bin v Isa and Shaikh Salman bln Hamad 9 the question of Improving the Bahrain 'armaments w has been brought up. At one time we even had some discussion about the possibility of Installing an anti-aircraft gun or two y but in view of the difficulties of obtaining such weapons and of training crews to use thea 9 and in the light of an unofficial intimation that they are really not necessary here 9 this idea has f for the time being at any rate 9 been dropped. 3. Nevertheless the Shaikhs are very anxious to get modem machine guns. After all we cannot entirely exclude the possi bility that there might be internal trouble here (there is an immense foreign population - Saudi, Persian, Iraqi and so on) 9 and I feel it would be very wrong indeed for us to discourage the Shaikhs. Half a dozen machine guns might make all the difference to our internal defence plans some day. 4.

R. rtic.-* flTHE IMPORTANCE OF OIL SUPPLIES FROM BAHREIN . Menorandura by the Pet role ;n Department* In ina ing the allocations from sources of supply for a European war, the Reserves Sub-Coranittee disregarded Bahrein as its production at that time, although increasing, was small. In 1936 the output was about 700,000 tons. This increased to 1,100,000 tons in 1937- The potential output is probably considerably in excess of this figure. A refinery has recently been erected for the treatment of crude oil and it appears likely that the crude output will be restricted to the level required to meet the needs of the refinery and any special demand for crude oil. When consideration was given to the requirements for a Par Eastern war it appeared that there was likely to be difficulty in securing sufficient fuel oil supplies for consumption East of Suez, and 500,000 tons of fuel oil have been allocated from Bahrein, mainly for India. When requirements for the dual contingency of a Par Easternvsnr and the Mediterranean closed are worked out in accordance with the recent direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence (see ^O.B. (P#R.)118), it is probable that Bahrein will be looked to to furnish larger quantities of products to meet the requirements East of Suez in order to avoid long hauls from the Western Oilfields. It was reported by the Political Agent in Bahrein in the early part of this year that the Japanese transport and supply ship 'Sata” which is manned entirely by officers and men of the Japanese Imperial Navy proposed to visit the Island of Bahrein in February, ostensibly to collect part of a consignment of fuel oil which had been sold to the Japanese Government some months earlier/2. The Japanese requested facilities to inspect the Bahrein Oil Company’s operations, etc., both at Bahrein and on the mainland of SaudiArabia, but after consultation vrith the India Office the Company refused to give facilities. Subsequently the London representative of the Company persuaded the American Company to arrange for the celivery of the oil at Singapore, thus making it unnecessary for the 'Sata' to go to Bahrein at all. This proposal was apparently not acceptable to the Japanese for the ”Sata” arrived at Bahrein on the ?th February. An extract from the report by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the visit of the 'Sata” which has been received from the India Office is attached. In view of this report it is difficult not to reach the conclusion that the main purpose of the Japanese visit v/as to obtain exact local knowledge of the oil field and refinery and to size up the possibilities of attack by sea and air. The Bahrein Islands form an independent Shei -hdom. There are, however, special treaty arrangements with the Sheikh of Bahrein and certain other Gheikhs in the Persian Gulf as a result of which they are regarded as ”territories under His Majesty’s protection' . In the event of an emergency, the Sheikh would be raoved to take control of the oil industry. Xn view 01 the importance of Bahrein as a source of supply in an emergency, and bearing in mind also the possibility of interference with supplies from Iran and Iraq, it is suggested tiiat the question of affording the oil field some defence against enemy attack by sea or air should be considered. Petroleum Department, London, S.W.1. March, 1938Extract from an Express Letter from Political Residenty Bushire* on H.M.S. Bideford, to Secretary of St ate for India* London f dated 18th FeBruaryt 1958 * 'A / Uur 1. Previous to SATA’s arrival various arrangements were made By the Political Agent, in conjunction with the Bahrein Government and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, to keep her under observation and to shepherd any authorised parties that might land, and prevent any unauthorised activities* 2. SATA arrived at Bahrein at 8 a.ra. on the 7th February, and anchored off Sitrah about 3 hours later when she was visited by an Officer of H.M.S. DEPTFORD. She carried no aeroplanes. Oil loading proceeded at once and was finished by the follo./in^ morning. SATA then proceeded to the anchorage indicated by the Bahrein Government i. e., off Manamah, but as she c rew about 30 feet this proved to be some 18 miles off land. The Political Agent visited SATA at this anchorage the same day. 3. On the 9th February SATA’s Captain with 8 of his officers returned the Political Agent’s call, and then by invitation with some of his officers called at the Naval Base where they were entertained by DEPTFORD’a officers. The rest of the Japanese officers were taken round the town, and out to the Portuguese Fort. 4. on the 10th February a party of ten Japanese officers cane on shore. They split into two parties, one ’doing’ the town and the Portuguese Fort, and the other Muharraq Island. 5. On the 11th and 12th February owing to a strong shamal (North Wind) there was no question of any party from SATA coming on shore. 6. SATA was due to sail on the 13th February, and in the evening of that day carried out some rather queer manoeuvres, coming quite close into Galali on the north-east comer of iuharraq. During this time she was under observation from three police posts on Muharraq Island. She lowered no launches, what the object of these/&lt;£&gt; these manoeuvres was# not heing a Naval expert# I caniot say. 7* Towards the end of his report Mr. Weightman says: 'On the following two days (i. e. 11th and 12th February) a tremendous shamal blew and there was no possibility whatsoever of their coming ashore. If therefore they came to Bahrein with any ideas about spying they must have been dismally disappointed# though I dare say they took some photographs with telephoto lenses from the Sitrah anchorage. However# as any one can do that and as one can buy photographs for a few annas# I do not think that is much to worry about 8. Personally I do not altogether agree with Mr. Weightman’s views. hat the precise value to the Japanese Admiralty of SATA’s visit may be I must leave to Naval opinion# but the following connents occur to me. Bahrein having no defences# the Naval Base for instance consists merely of an Officers’ club# a canteen# and various other recreational facilities# no question of actual M spying” arises. There are, however# various objectives which a hostile Japanese cruiser in war would like to have marked as accurately as possible for purposes of bombardment. These would be the Refinery# the Oil Field# the W/T installation# the aerodrome# Mr. Weightman’s own residence (.’) and so forth. The two first objectives the Japanese officers were not# of course# allowed to visit# but during their twenty-four hours’ stay off Sitrah they could# I imagine# with the aid of good glasses# place some of their main features on their maps. The other objectives the/ could 'place” as the result of their visits on shore: no doubt some members of their shore party were trained in that sort of work. There are also questions of navigation and channels# not too easy in the vicinity of Bahrein which SATA doubtless cleared up. 9* There is no doubt that the Japanese Admiralty attached importance to SATA’s visit. As you are aware the ostensible reason given for the visit was to collect part of a consignment of fuel oil which was sold some months ago by the Californian Standard/Standard Oil Company to the Japanese Navy* Corribined with this was a request - a somewhat curious one - that facilities should he given to the officers to inspect the Company’s operation in Bahrein and Saudi Arabia, The Company replied that they would arrange for oil to be delivered at Singapore&gt; thus making it unnecessary for SATA to go to Bahrein, and further that they were unable to grant the request for inspection of their operations* 10. In spite of this the Japanese Admiralty, at a juncture when in view of their war with China one would imagine they would try and curtail unnecessary movements of their ships, insisted on sending the SATA on a voyage of some thousands ofOffice of tile Political Resident in tke Persian uulf, JriOp Kj»t »oni* ■ 1st July 193d, ^.Q.^O.a/508 My dear Peel / pleas&lt; Could you ase refer to your deuii-efiici&amp;l letter lio.P # £.3297/3b of tne 2dtii Jiay 19 jo # enclesix)^ a copy of a Mote by tiie Petroleui«i OeprrWent empnasiciut &amp;ne importance of Baxxrairi as a s iurce of oil supply* 2* I read toe Mo , ouch interest.

Also I understand that the Commander in Chief will be arriving in the Gulf at the end of Ramadhan - and pro bably arriving in Bahrain during the 'Id - and that will not our recent practice, and it nay be some considerable time befc we can arrange another practice which could, of course, include a 'black-out” there, plus the extinguishing of their flares* and I do not think we shall be ready by the time the Commander in Chief arrives* (c) There seem also to be the following considerations. Our Bahrain internal security scheme cannot of course c ope with enemy raider* coming either by sea or by air. We have no anti-aircraft defence and consequently I should personally assume that any hostile aircraft intending to bomb Bahrain and the Refinery would time its departure from its base to arrive here in day-light. As for enemy warships or raiders, what we should want in particular would be the extinguishing of all be a particularly good time for us to stage a 'black-out' in the towns. (b) So far as the Bahrain Petroleum Company is concerned, we now have to examine very carefully the lessons learnt in Captain Allan Poland, D.S*C*, R.N*, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, H. M. S. Shoreham* navigation/navigation lights and of the Refinery and Oil Field flares. i.t might well he useful to ’’black-out' the whole Refinery, but I am not so sure that lights in Manamah and Muharraq would, in view of the situation of these towns, be of the least use to enemy ships for navigational purposes. And xinally unless all British Naval forces were eliminated Ce.g, the sloops by sinking and units of the East Indies Squadron by distance, in which case the raiders would be in no hurry and could wait till day-light) would they be likely to waste valuable ammunition on the towns? The Re* finery must necessarily be the first objective, and valuable as it might be to destroy our wireless, power house, etcetera, it ould, I imagine, be foolishly expensive to try to hit these at night, whether or not there were any lights showing in the town, I admit this is all amateur stuff, but at any rate there is no harm in putting forward an opinion even if it is only to be demolished latert 3. I am going into the question of the Bahrain Radio hours of v/atch, and will let you know the result in due course, Penfold thinks he could manage a 24 hours watch on his existing staff for a short time but obviously reliefs would be required pretty soon.

In the first place the new plant will not be ready oelore August as the material due from Germany is being delayed for lack of raw materials; also some of the stuff from America seems to have been in a ship which went aground somewhere in the Pacific. The spirit which will be produced from the new polymerization plant is a motor spirit and will not qualify exactly as an aviation spirit. The motor spirit will have an octane of 80 to 85 and after being blended with reformed spirit will have a vapour pressure of about 9 lbs. Although it is not a pure aviation spirit it can probably be leaded up to an octane of about 90 but will still have rather a high vapour pressure (I think about 7 lbs) and higher fractional points than normal aviation spirit. TfeverthelesS although such a spirit does not give 100 per cent efficiency in an aeroplane engine using say a 87 octane aviation spirit, it will certainly be adeouate for normal functioning. There will be some loss of acceleration and I gather that spirit with a high vapour pressure ought not to be used at greft heights; but probably neither of these deficiencies would be very serious for Royal Air Force work up and down the Gulf. 3. Once the plant is completed I am told that the Company will want five days’ notice in order to produce a spirit usable in aircraft.

Apparently there are variations one way or another between types of equipments used in the different oil fields and refineries and they both think that the different companies will prefer to maintain their own stocks of spares. For instance the ahrain Petroleum Company have spares to the value of roughly a million and a quarter dollars here in Bahrain. As for things like sheet steel, pipes and so on they are already examining the possi ility of improving and accelerating supplies from India in case of need. 3. If you would like it I could take up the matter again when Thornburg comes back here but I feel very doubtful after yesterday* s conversation whether this particular ball can be set rolling by any one of the oil companies and I am sure we should have to take the initiative ourselves.

There is one point on which I would ask for a little more information. In the statement of particulars about Havildar Ali Bahadur it is noted that he has 'no fingliah qualification’*. I am not sure if this merely means that he has not oassed an examination in -English or whether he knows no English at all. It is essential, for purposes of 'cover’*, that he should be able to receive orders and make reoorts to European and American per sonnel who look after the electrical installation in the Oil ,o;K,any 3 Camp, and as none of them know Trdu or Gujarati, I am afraid that Ali Bahadur would be of no use unless he had some knowledge of English, it need not be e very extensive knowledge, so long as he is just able to understand and make himself under stood — even in the most battered form of the English language. 3. Could you let me know if he is capable of this ? If so perhaps he could be informed at once that he will be receiving an offer of employment direct from the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s recruiting agent in India. I shall then arrange to get in touch with him myself when he arrives here. * 4. I an. a ending a copy of this letter to Sir frenohard Kowle. Iv'ajor W. H.

The gate sentries will be assisted by one Company natur (gateman) who will open the gate and will assist in searching vehicles and persons as necessary. 4. All motor vehicles driven by European and American employees of the Company must be stopped on entry into the Refinery and the sentry must look in the back of pick-ups etc., for any packages. If such packages are seen they should be shown to the European official in charge of the gate. Euro pean and American employees need not be stopped on exit from the Refinery* 5* All motor vehicles driven by local drivers must be otopped and searched and the driver and local passengers must also be searched. Any packages found in the vehicles or carried on the persons of passengers must be handed over to the official in charge of the gate. If the vehicle has a red mask (cover) over one headlight and is carrying an European or American or a policeman in uniform it need not be searched* Searching of local employees (G* S* and U.) This will be done at shift change times by a separate party of one N.C.O* and 4 policemen who remain in reserve at the gate at all times and may be called on for duty at a moment’s notice. The A- 2 - 4 1 # The search will be done under the supervision of the European official in charge of the gate* Particular attention should be paid to (a) Searching of clothing and head-gear; (b) Searching of tiffin-carriers; (c) the necessity for taking any package found to the official in charge of the gate; (d) Ensuring that no local employee enters the Refinery unless he can show his number disc. Searching of Indian employees (C and T) 7* This will be done by Khan Sahib Ismail Khan and Karamdad who will carry out the searches in accordance with instructions as above, under the supervision of the European official in charge of the gate.

Note A cartridge must not be loaded into the chamber of the rifle. If the officer in charge of the Refinery Defence is present he will take the party of police in a pick-up to the point at which the Verey light was seen. If the officer is not present, the 12 policemen will proceed by the first motor vehicle they can obtain, accompanied by the senior N.C.O., to jthe alarm point. The remainder of the police off duty will turn out and stand by fully equipped. No sentry on duty must leave his post if a Verey light is seen in another locality.Naturs on duty with search-lights 1* Three naturs will man each search-light from dusk to dawn. There must be one natur operating the light at all times, one on guard at the foot of the light pole and the third man resting. The three men can change round their duties hourly in order to give each man an equal amount of rest during the night. 2. The object of the search-lights is to detect unautho rised persons approaching the Refinery fence, whether inside or outside, and naturs must stop any unauthorised persons or vehicles and do their best to apprehend them. They need not stop vehicles which have red masks over one headlight but they should stop all other vehicles within one hundred yards of the Refinery fence and hold them until the mobile car patrol arrives and then hand over the persons to the policeman in charge of the mobile patrol car. Naturs will be given Verey pistols which must only be fired if they need help in carrying out their duties or if they are instructed to do so by a policeman who needs help. The. Verey pistol must be pointed high into the air and fired outwards from the Refinery-4- O 6 Mobile Patrols The patrol will consist of one policeman armed with a rifle and ten rounds S.A.A., one driver who speaks both English and Arabic, and a motor fitted with a spot light. At night the policeman will carry also one Verey light and three red cartridges. 2. By day the patrol car will cover all roads round the Refinery boundary and also the road down the pipeline between the Refinery and the Sitra Terminal. The patrol will visit all sentries and the police post at the Sitra Terminal and will ensure that they are alert. 3. Any motors on the roads round the Refinery and along the pipeline not carrying a red mask over one headlight will be stopped by the patrol car drawing to the middle of the road and the policeman dismounting and standing at the 'ready 11 . vEf after having searched the motor and questioned its occupants the policeman is still not satisfied he must escort them to the main gate and turn them over to the officer in charge. 4. In the same way all persons on foot within 100 yards of the Refinery fence must be challenged and if they do not prove to the satisfaction of the policeman that they are engaged on Company^ duty they must be taken to the main gate. 5. The mobile patrol should not make a regular circuit but can take any route at the discretion of the policeman in charge provided he visits all sentries at least once an hour. 6. At night there will be two patrols and their duties will be the same as during the day. The policeman in charge of each patrol must in addition ensure that the naturs on duty at the search-lights are alert. One car will patrol the roads round the Refinery the whole time while the second car will make alternate circuits of the Refinery and journeys along the pipeline between the Refinery and Sitra Terminal* A/--5- A Verey pistol and 3 cartridges will be issued to each patrol for use in emergency only during the night. Uhe policeman in charge must understand that the Verey pistol is only to be fired in an emergency, i.e. when the patrol needs help in making a capture or in preventing sabotage or unauthorised entry into the Refinery. Verey pistols must be aimed high into the air. 7. The method of stopping cars by night will be by drawing into the middle of theioad and turning on the patrol car*s spot-light. 8. No cars need be stopped on the main Awali-Sitra roadr - 6 - Perimeter Posts Two sentries are stationed at each of the following locations 24 hours a day, doing 2 hours duty on and 4 hours off* (a) Powder Magazine (b) On the outside of the boundary fence between the old Powder Magazine and the v/est side of the Acid Manufacturing Plant* (c) Between the north east corner of the Refinery and the Coking Gate on the east side* 2. Sentries at the Powder Magazine will prevent any person or vehicle entering the Magazine enclosure except an European or American official of the Company arriving in a motor vehicle with a red mask over one headlight, - and local personnel accompanying and vouched for by that European or Americal official* 3. Sentries on beats (b) and (c) will challenge all persons and vehicles which approach within 100 yards of the Refinery fence at their respective beats, and if not satisfied will hold them until the patrol car makes its round. The policeman in charge of the patrol car will then take charge* 4 # These sentries should remember that it is just as imp- ortant to prevent people on the inside of the fence as well as on the outside loitering near the fence. Note Sentries are informed that Company naturs are posted on the inside of the fence at the Coking Gate, South Gate and the West Gate throughout the day and night as an additional precaution and that these gates normally remain closed. 5. Should any of the sentries need assistance in dealing with suspicious persons during the night they must shout to the nearest searhh-light post and the natur on duty will fire a Verey light* 6. No sentry on duty must leave his post on seeing or hearing an alarm in another locality.Sitra Terminal and Tanks The police guard consists of one N.C»C* and 3 policemen, this force providing one sentry at all times at the gate for the aid and protection of the Company gate-man* Sentries will bd on duty for 2 hours and have 4 hours off* 2. The sentry on duty will allow any European or American employee of the Company on duty to enter the Terminal, but no other person may be allowed to enter unless the Company gate-man is satisfied that that person is entering on duty. Should the sentry have any doubt whatsoever about any person he should con sult any European or American official who may be on duty at the Terminal in order to identify the person under suspicion; and if there is no European or American there he should hold the person under suspicion v/hile the N.C.O* in charge telephones to the officer in charge at the Refinery for instructions. 3. Any unauthorised person attempting to enter the Terminal should be arrested and a report telephoned to the officer in charge at the Refinery. 4. The N.C.O. in charge will be responsible for ensuring that reports are telephoned every hour to the officer in charge at the Refinery throughout the day and night. 5. The search-lights will be manned by three naturs each from dusk to dawn. There must be one natur operating the light at all times, one on guard at the foot of the light pole and the third man resting. The three naturs will change round their duties hourly in order to give each man the needful amount of rest during the night. 6. The object of the search-lights is to detect unauthorised persons approaching the Terminal and if a natur working a light sees any suspicious person the two men at the bottom of the pole must shout to the police, and attempt to apprehend the suspicious person. 7. If the sentry observes a Verey light fired at the Loading Wharf he must at once inform the officer in charge at the Refinery by telephone.Sitra Pier One Company natur is on duty at all times on the Pier and has instructions to carry out his regular duties, such as seeing that the smoking restriction is observed and that the register is signed by persons travelling on out-going and incoming launches and boats. The guard of one N.C.O. and 3 policemen will protect the natur, one sentry being on duty at the Pier Gate at all times. Each sentry will be on duty for 2 hours and have 4 hours off. 2. The N.C.O. in charge will communicate with the officer in charge at the Refinery by telephone in case of emergency and he will also be responsible for telephoning a report every hour throughout the day and night. 3. If any suspicious person is observed loitering in the vicinity of the Pier and attempting to damage the property the guard will at once apprehend him and report by telephone to the officer in charge at the Refinery. 4. Should the sentry be doubtful whether any person is authorised to enter the Pier he should communicate by telephone to the officer in charge at the Refinery and meanwhile hold the person under suspicion. 5. If the sentry observes a Verey light fired at the Loading Y/harf he must at once inform the officer in charge at the Refinery by telephone.Sitra Wharf -9- An European official of the Company will be in direct charge of the Wharf Guard and will sleep at the Wharf on all nights when there is no tanker being loaded or unloaded. He will also visit the Wharf during daylight hours. 2. When a tanker is being loaded at the Wharf there will be an European official in charge who will be solely responsible for giving orders for any action that may be necessary in an emergency. 3. The police guard will live aboard a barge allotted to them and will use a small motor boat which is provided between the Wharf and the barge. Two sentries will be on duty at all times on the Wharf itself, doing 2 hours duty and having 4 hours off. 4. The guard will apprehend any strange persons endeavouring to land at the Wharf• 5. A Company watchman will be on duty at the Wharf at all times and will inform sentries if he suspects that any boat approaching the Wharf is brining persons other than the Com pany^ authorised personnel. 6. A Verey pistol and three red cartridges will be kept by the guard at the Wharf in case of emergency only. Verey pistols must be aimed high into the air. reporting by telephone every hour throughout the day and night to No. 188. The guard on duty will also instruct the watchman to report by telephone the presence of any boats of which they are suspicious. 8. The guard at the Wharf will be changed weekly. 7. The Company watchman on duty will be responsible foriTf FISLD, CAMP AND REFINBHY DEFENCE General Considerations 1. The object is to provide maximum protection with minimum interference with normal operations 5 against sabotage by hostile agents who: (a) might have been planted in the Company^ employment, and might either act alone or in concert with Asiatic assistants from the population of Bahrain, or (b) might be disguised as normal members of the Manama or Muharraq population and yet possess a standard of technical knowledge or have received sufficiently specific instructions to enable them to concentrate destructive effort on vital points. 2. If such agents are in Bahrain they will of course be provided with the necessary explosives, abrasives or combustibles. 3. At the present stage armed raids from the mainland or armed risings in Bahrain are not anticipated; though the possibility of enemy agents organising the former at least, as time goes on, must be borne in mind; and plans will be drawn up in detail in due course to meet such an emergency. Principles 4. The basic principles on which the defence plans are framed are as follows (a) Field Declared a prohibited area. The more vulnerable wells, damage to which would cause maximum interference with production and maximum harm to the field in general, are being sandbagged and will, it is expected, be further protected with concrete platforms and concrete walls to close the cellars. This does not provide total protection but should delay efforts at sabotage long enough to ensure that mobile patrols can intervene before extensive damage is done. Tank /-Tank batteries and the Zellaq Pumping Station are fenced and are under constant guard by natur sentries, who have detailed alarm instructions. (b) Awali Camp Generally speaking is not a protective area since raids and risings are not anticipated. Certain important points — the shops, stores and water tanks — are patrolled. In general the camp area is not a good 'prospect' for saboteurs in view of (a) the lack of vital objectives and (b) the fact that there are at all times large numbers of Staff employees present in the Camp. Cc) Refiner y Prohibited area. N.B . The prohibited area is extended to a periphery of 100 yards from the Refinery Fence. Defence in the Refinery is based on two complementary but operationally quite separate systems. Police protection is confined to the perimeter, and is designed to prevent the i ingress of unauthorised persons or articles. Inside the perimeter, protection has been afforded : (i) by segregating certain operating units by means of wire enclosures, protective screens, etc; (ii) by intensifying supervision and control in each individual unit; and (iii) by more frequent 'rounds' by operators. Special emergency practices and standards are enjoined on all operating staff. Perimeter protection cannot be made 100 % safe but — particularly when more adequate lighting apparatus is received — it should have a high deterrent value and should serve to deprive would-be saboteurs of simple ways of access for themselves and/or for possible assistants and destructive materials. The maintenance of efficiency in the gate-search is therefore of vital importance; and equally important are constant rounds by patrol cars to ensure that police sentries- /'a -3- (and naturs on the lights at night) are alert* This applies equally to subsidiary posts at Sitra Terminal and Pier.REFIN3RY DSF^NCB (3 Detailed Orders for the Officer in Charge The officer in charge will be responsible for all defence measures bn the Refinery Perimeter and in the 3itra Area during the period of his duty* 2. The object of the measures in force is to prevent un authorised persons entering the Reiinery or other defensive points and to prevent explosives, abrasives, etc., from being passed in through the gate or through the fence. For these reasons the search of personnel and packages at the Refinery Main Gate, and the constant supervision of defence personnel on the Perimeter is of vital importance. 3. Detailed orders have been worked out for all police and naturs, and these orders have been translated into Arabic and are learnt by heart by the men. The officer in charge should acquaint himself fully with these orders and ensure that any instructions that he himself may have to give to the police and naturs are fully in consonance with them. 4. Apart from frequent visits of inspection of all sentries (and of naturs on duty at night), the officer in charge must ensure that mobile patrols in charge of policemen perform their w d ensure that the search at the gate is carried out carefully, and if the European official in charge of the gate is in any difficulty he should lend his aid and support. 6. In the event of an alarm from any of the sentry or natur posts the officer in charge should as quickly as possible pick up the party of 12 police (who are ordered to turn out at the Refinery Main Gate immediately on an alarm being observed), and take them to the point of alarm where he should deal with the situation as circumstances may require. 7. Should any policeman or natur be found failing in his duty the officer in charge must place him under suspension and inform /-- 2 - inform Captain Byard, Assistant to the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, of the fact by telephone with the least possible delay. Minor delinquencies can be reported to Captain Byard on his visits to the police headquarters at the Hefinery, and the latter will then take such disciplinary action as may be required. 8. Should the officer in charge find any deficiencies in the detailed orders now given to the police and naturs he should make a record thereof and forward it to the General Manager, Bahrain Petroleum Company. No alterations are to be made in the instructions given to the police and naturs without prior approval in writing having been obtained through the General Manager. 9. The officer in charge will receive or arrange for the reception of hourly telephone reports from Sitra Terminal, Pier and Wharf (vide the instructions to these points). These and other reports should be logged. • • • •Detailed Orders for the European Official in charge of the Refinery Gate Guard The Staff employee on this post is in charge of the Gate Guard and is responsible that the detailed orders in respect of searching of persons and vehicles are diligently and carefully carried out. To ensure this, constant and close supervision is essential and in particular the search of packages crates, food-carriers, etc., requires careful v/atch. Perfunctory searches should not be allowed. 2. If an alarm is observed from any of the police or natur posts and the officer in charge of Refinery Defence is away on patrol then the officer in charge at the gate should aid the senior police N.C.O. in charge of the 'alarm parti^' of police to obtain transport and to proceed at once to the point of alarm. The officer in charge at the gate will remain at his own post during such alarms and will ensure that gate protection remains unimpaired. 3. Any delinquencies, insubordination or inefficiency on the part of the police party at the gate should be reported in detail to the officer in charge of Refinery Defence. 4. The following points are noted for the information of the officer in charge of the Gate Guard (A) No taxis are in any circumstances to be allowed to pass through the Refinery Gate. (B) Whenever freight is being sent from Sitra into the Refinery, the Stores Department will inform the officer in charge at the Refinery Gate by telephone that a truck containing so many closed packages is being despatched. A brief description of the packages will be given. On arrival at the Refinery Gate the truck can be passed in provided the packages are properly marked and show no signs of tampering. All issues from the Awali Storehouse will also be reported in advance by telephone in the same way and boxes containing such /-bo - 2 - s ucb issues from Awali will be sent opened so that they may be inspected at the Gate. No parcels or packages addressed to individuals by name should be allowed to enter the Refinery. (C) Drivers of pick-ups sent by Transportation in response to telephone requisitions from units in the Refinery will carry slips issued by Transportation showing the designation of the requisitioning unit. v'—\' • u r^\ r*\ M M K D I A T E Confidential D.C.

Staff men have been appointed to represent the Superintendent in matters of internal Refinery defence, including internal patrol of Refinery and Tank Field, and will function 24 hours per day. These men may be summoned at any time on the regular Refinery call whistle (the Telephone operator should, be instructed to blow Mr. W.E. Sim*s call)• These men will be referred to as the Representatives throughout these instructions. The Superintendent's Representatives in this groub/W. Sims, N. Janke, J. Creecy and W. Linaenblatt, and they are especially assigned to full time on internal defence They are all trained operators and, in this particular case, Americans. Standard Operating Instructions are issued covering the sale practice to be followed, and the proper action to be taken in case of emergency on each Refinery operating unit. These standard operating instructions must be followed m detail except as modified in writing by the Refinery Superintendent or the Assistant Superintendent. These standards are avail able in book form at each operating unit. Each Staff man in charge of the shift at each operating unit has been instructed to check the A, S &amp; U (artizan, skilled and unskilled) employees to see that * k* n n (a) Only those men known to him are allowed to oe on the unit, and (b) That they are not allowed to carry any suspicious bundles or other equipment within the confines of the respective plant. Throughout the working day, the Staff man in charge of A, S an( i u employees is responsible for them and should see thafthey do not leave their posts without his Vision and that they have good reasons for leaving. If P ‘ J to leave their posts is granted the Stafl man should see that the A 3 or U employees return within a reasonable time This ruling is intended to keep employees from wandering into other°departments where they have no authority to go. If A S or U employees leave their posts without proper authority the Representative shall be called on the whistle immediately, the man located and appropriateaction taken to keep him disciplined or remove him from the job. A, s or 5 employees who habitually offend in this manner will be dealt with by dismissal.^ i * 6. Certain Operating units have been fenced around, the purpose being to prevent the entrance of unauthorised persons into the areas that are enclosed. The Staff man on duty at each unit will take the necessary pre cautions to prevent this purpose being violated. 7. Staff men in charge of maintenance gangs will, on start ing work within a unit area, present a Work Permit for signature by the Staff Operator in charge at that time outlining the nature of the work and the number of A, S and U employees detailed for work in the plant area. If the work does not necessitate the constant presence of the Staff Maintenance man he will hand over his gang to the Staff Operator who will assume the responsibility for the native maintenance employees who will follow these rules. 8. All Staff men v/ithin the Refinery shall be on the alert for all suspicious movements of men within the Refinery, reporting questionable conditions to the Representative for careful check up. 9. Staff men will inform A, S and U employees under their jurisdiction whom they feel they can trust without doubt of the above rules, demanding their co-operation to see that there is no divergence of these rules and to report any suspicious conditions. 10. A committee has been appointed to assist the Superintendent in matters of internal Refinery defence. Any suggestions that Staff men may consider appropriate may be put forward to W. R. Walker for consideration by this Committee. The Committee, as follows, are to meet in the Superintendents office on Tuesday, September 12th, at 10 a.m. for a dis cussion : - WALKER, L.H.T. DUKE, H.R. REID CANE, J.J. SMITH, C.H.P. ROSE, D.H. 0 , R0RKE, T.T. ATKINSON, R.A. JACKSON, A. WARDROP, C . R. 0 . WALKER, W.R. 11. The above rules may be altered from time to time at the recommendation of the Committee.PRECAUTIONS TAKEN TO ENSURE THE SAFE OPERATION OF THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY REFINERY. To protect against internal sabotage or wilfful maliciousness within the Bahrein Refinery certain additional precautions have been taken. In the operation of an oil refinery safe operating practices and standards are at all times available to the Staff operators. If these standards are followed carefully by all Staff men as well as A, S &amp; U employees there should be no difficulties. However, consid- ^ ering the large number of A, S and U employees that are used in operation, and considering also that it is most difficult for them to know all the hazards that exist, it is felt that the best protection that can be afforded is to increase the n’amber of Staff employees, thereby giving more detailed super vision to A, S and U employees. Therefore, the best men that we have available were put on this type of work. The men detailed to this work are Staff employees, capable of running any of our Operating units. v normal in an oil refinery are as follows 1) Fences have been placed round all major operating units. The principal purpose of these is to keep A, S and U men from wandering within these units when they have no businessi-to 2) Windows in the Power Plant district facing on Switch Boards have been protected. 3) Transformer banks have been protected. 4) Lubricating Oil stocks have been put in locked storage, only accessible to Staff Employees. 5) Roads have been made accessible to all parts of the Refinery and Tank Field so that men can easily get from one part to another. 6) Water Wells have been protect by fences. 7) Additional lighting is being planned for the darker parts of the Refinery and Tank Fields. 8) Gaugers and Pumpers in the Tank Field area are making this area. 9 ) Operators within the units are doubling their rounds, watching closely all operating equipment./; 11) Construction work is being rushed to completion to have as few men on this type of work as possible. At the present time of writing construction work will go on until early December, but we hope that when this is finished no more major construction work will be necessary 12) Nat(f&gt;urs have been placed inside the Refinery at all gates. Th^e men are old time employees a*® are familiar with the internal workings of the plant. 13) The Fire Marshall has been placed on duty 24 hours, to ensure the protection of the Refinery from fire. Safety measures taken that are not considered as more frequent rounds to ensure that no one has entered2 m 14) The Fire House is kept open with a man in charge 24 hours a day. 15) Fire Drills and practices are being increased so that a greater number of men will be thoroughly trained in fire fighting practices. 16) Our regular fire organisation that is now in force as a normal protection will also be used in the case of any abnormal emergency. There are 4 syrens placed in Awali that can be sounded at any time, and at this sound men will proceed to their posts ready for duty. 17) Blackout practices are now being studied, making it possible to turn out numerous lights and flares at very short notice. All of the internal safety measures are directly ^ under the control of the Refinery Superintendent and he is working with his staff on all precautionary measures. From time to time there will be additions and changes, and if they are of any major importance they will be added to this list* Awali, Bahrein, September 11, 1939, MHL:B.x^ c THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Awali ) Bahrein Island.

Weightman, Esq., Manama, Bahrein.7 / 8/- ORDERS FOR THE OFFICER IN CHAHGS OF THE FIELD The officer in charge of the Field will be responsible for all defence measures in the Field during his period of duty (8 hours). During this time his headquarters will be at the old Jebel Camp. 2. He will be responsible for exercising general control and supervision over the police and naturs employed on Field Defence and for issuing instructions as circumstances may demand, which instructions must be in consonance with the written orders prepared for police and naturs. No alteration in these orders may be made without prior approval in writing having been obtained through the Chief Local Representative, to whom suggestions in writing can be made. 3. He will keep a log of all events connected with defence measures with times of their occurrence. 4. For the purpose of receiving telephone reports and for any interpreter* s work required he will be assisted by a junior clerk provided by the Company who knov/s both English and Arabic. t 5. He is responsible for ensuring that any attempts to tamper with wells, pipe lines and tank batteries are reported by telephone to Mr. Bush - No. 16 during the day and No. 46 at night. He will call these numbers if any assistance is required. 6 . He will carry out periodic inspection of tank battery guards and the more important wells in the Field during the period of his duty. When going out on rounds of inspection he should leave word with his clerk indicating which area he is visiting and when he expects to return to headquarters. 7. The officer in charge will also keep a check on the movements of camel patrols in each area and see that they are carrying out their duties according to their instructions.@ IV / 8 . toy policeman or natur failing in his duty should be placed under suspension by the officer in charge who should arrange through the Chief Local Representative’s office to inform Captain Byard, Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, of the fact by telephone v/ith the least possible delay. Minor delinquencies can be reported to Captain Byard on his visits to the units in the Field and the latter will take such disciplinary action as may be required* 9. In the case of an alarm (by Verey light) the officer in charge should, if he is on inspection patrol, return at once to Jebel Headquarters and there pick up the police and naturs off duty, instruct his clerk to telephone a report at once to Awali and proceed with the police and naturs to the place of alarm, where he will deal with the situation as cir cumstances may require* 10. Should the officer in charge of the Field himself detect an attempt at sabotage he should only attempt to deal with it by himself if he is completely satisfied that there is no danger of his being overpowered. Otherwise he should return at once to headquarters to pick up the police and naturs and give the alarm. 11. The system of reporting by patrol cars in charge of police and by camel sections has been detailed in their orders. Should any patrol car fail to telephone a report within la bours of its previous report the officer in charge should take out in his pick-up the police and naturs off duty and proceed to investigate. a camel patrol has failed to report within a period of la bours investigation should at once be made. When proceeding on such investigations the officer in charge should instruct the clerk to report the fact to Mr. Similarly if a mobile patrol reports by telephone that Bu sh./--4- if ORDERS FOR THE MOBILE PATROLS IN TH5 FI3LD 1. There will he three pick-ups running 24 hours a day for the patrol of the Field and the inspection of wells and tank batteries* Each car will be manned by one policeman, one natur and a driver, who will be on duty for 8 hours at a time* The policeman is in charge of the patrol car and while patrolling the natur and driver will act on his orders* 2. One patrol car will operate in each of the three areas marked on the map and the drivers and policemen in the cars will be informed by the officer in charge of the Field in which area they are to patrol. Patrol cars must in no circumstances go outside their own areas except to report personally to Jebel Headquarters when unable to report by telephone (see paragraph 6 below)• 3. The policeman and natur in each car will be armed with a rifle and ten rounds of ammunition each. The policeman will load the ammunition only into the magazine and the natur* s rifle will not be loaded. Each car will also be provided with one electric torchlight and one Verey light pistol with 4 cartridges. 4. The headquarters for the mobile patrols are at the Jebel Camp, where the policemen and naturs off duty will remain. 5. Each patrol car is able to complete a full round of its own area inside Ig- hours: and this period must not be exceeded except in case of mechanical breakdown or when the patrol is investigating suspicious circumstances or is dealing with an attempt at sabotage. 6. The policemen in charge of the thred patrol cars are res ponsible for making reports by telephone to Jebel Headquarters after every complete round of their areas as follows In area (1), the telephone report shopld be made from tank battery No. 1. In area (2) the telephone report should be made from tank battery No. 3. In area (3) the telephone report should be made from tank battery No. 2. A/--5- A clerk of the Company is on duty at Jebel Headquarters to receive these reports. If there is no reply to a telephone call the patrol car should go immediately to the Jebel Head quarters to report and then return to its own area* 7. By day and by night each patrol aar will cover all ** roads and inspect all designated wells and tank batteries in its area. At eafh well the policeman and natur should get ** T out of the car, and 5 Area (1) Wells Nos. 2, 8, 9, 36 and 53 Area ( 2 ) //ells Jos. 11, 39 , 40 , 51 and 68 } the driver must Area (3) Wells Nos. 13, 23, 27, 31, 32 and 55 5 - . . I remain seated in the car• The natur must inspect the well carefully to make sure that the sand-bag and concrete protection has not been tampered with and that there are no signs of oil leaks. The policeman should stand by v/ith his rifle ready during the natur* s ins pection and at night he should be careful to stand behind the lights of the patrol car. At night the driver must draw up the car with the lights shining on the well. At the tank batteries the mobile patrol will see that the naturs on duty are alert and are carrying out their duties properly. 8 . Should a patrol find anything during its round which £^17 attempt at sabotage at a well or tank batterv or should it encounter any unauthorised persons with whom the patrol is unable to deal by itself the alarm should be immediately raised by firing his red Verey lights at intervals of 2 minutes. Small leaks observed can be mentioned in the periodic telephone reports. 9. Only .cars having green masks over the right headlights are authorised In the Field. These and all other cars must be stopped to prove the identity of the persons in them and a careful look-out must be kept for unauthorised persons wandering in the Field Area. Cars /-- 6 - Gars v/ill be stopped by the patrol car drawing to the middle of the road and the policeman dismounting and standing at the ready* By night the patrol car* s spot light will be flashed on the car in addition. If a can has been stopped and the policeman is satisfied that the occupants are authorised to be in the Field he should wave on the car. If the policeman is not satisfied by the explanation of any person in a car or on foot he shopld take him in his own pick-up to the tank battery from which he telephones his reports to Jebel Headquarters and make an immediate report, holding the person concerned until the officer in charge arrives. 10. The patrol car in each area will visit the headquarters of the camel section in its area on every round. The policeman in charge of the patrol should pick up the camel section* s report and include it in his periodic telephone reports to Jebel Headquarters. 11. If a patrol car observes an alarm in another area it i should not go to the point of alarm but. continue on its own patrol * 12 . The mobile patrols will stop when requested by the camel patrols to take charge of any person held by the latter and will deal with such persons as in paragraph 9 above.-7- 77 0RD1SRS FOR TUB CAMEL CQF^S The strength of the camel corps is one N.C.O. and 18 men with camels* Of these six policemen and camels will be allotted for duty in each of the three areas shov/n on the map. 2. The section of six camel policemen allotted to each area will provide patrols of three camel policemen at night only each patrol being on duty half the night. Patrol parties will load ammunition only into the magazines of rifles. Patrols will be provided with electric torchlights, a Verey pistol and 4 red cartridges. During the day the men will be off duty and will graze and care for their camels. 3. The camel sections will visit the 'wells as follows (a) In area No. 1: wells Nos. 2, 8, 9, 36 and 53 (b) In area No. 2: wells Nos. 11, 39, 40, 51 and 68 (c) In area No. 3: wells Nos. 13, 23, 27, 31, 32 and 55 4. They will approach the wells silently with the object of surprising any unauthorised person tampering with the well pro tection. One camel policeman will dismount and with the aid of his torchlight will examine the sand-bag and concrete protection to make sure that they have not been tampered with and will also look for any leaks. 5. Should a patrol find anything during its round which indi cates any attempt at sabotage at a well or should it encounter any unauthorised persons with whom the patrol is unable to deal by itself the alarm should be immediately raised by firing red Verey lights at two minute intervals. Small leaks observed can be mentioned in the periodic reports on return to the patrols headquarters. 6 . Any unauthorised person found by a camel patrol will be held until the arrival of the patrol car and the person will then be handed over to the policeman in charge of the patrol car for removal.7 * Each camel patrol is able to visit the prescribed wells in its area within l4- hours and this period must not be exceeded except when the patrol is investigating suspicious circumstances or dealing with an attempt at sabotage. On completing a round the section on duty will leave a verbal report with the men off duty at its own headquarters and the latter will be responsible for passing on that report to the patrol car on its next visit* 8 . If an alarm is observed in any part of the Field all camel policemen^whether on duty or off, from all the three areas will at once proceed on their camels to the point of alarm. On arrival at the point of alarm they will carry out the orders given to* them by the officer in charge of the Field or, if he has not arrived, by the senior Police N.C.O. present. 9. The N.C.O. in charge of the Camel Corps should visit all camel posts at frequent intervals and ensure that the patrols are ready to go on duty at the proper time, that discipline is maintained and that the camels are properly cared for.-9- GRDSR3 FOR NATUR GUARDS AT TANK BATTZRI5S The guard at each tejik battery will consist of three naturs and each natur will be on duty for 8 hours every day. 2. The naturs will be armed with a rifle and ten rounds of ammunition. They will not load their rifles except in an emergency. 3. The duties of the natur guard are to protect the tank batteries : (a) by patrolling the tank battery inside the fence (b) by challenging all persons approaching and attempting to enter the tank battery fenced area and by questioning and searching all persons other than Europeans identi fied by the gauger. 4. Europeans will be admitted to the tank batteries and also any local employee of the Company accompanying them pro vided he shows his identification disc. In addition Indian and local gaugers visiting the tank batteries on duty may be allowed to enter after showing their identification cards to which their photographs are attached. 5. If after questioning any person approaching the tank battery the natur is not satisfied that he is authorised to be within the Field area he should call out the remainder of the guard and take the person into custody. Any person so arrested will be handed over by the natur guard to the patrol car when it next visits the tank battery. 6 . Should the guard require immediate assistance the alarm must be raised by firing at two minute intervals red Verey lights. The Verey light must be fired upwards and outwards away from the tank battery. The guard will then take all mea sures they can to protect the tank battery and prevent damage being done to it until assistance arrives. 7. If the guard on any tank battery observes an alarm from any part of the Field a telephone report should at once be made to Jebel Headquarters. Natur guards must in no circumstances leave their own tank batteries on seeing such an alarm.ORDERS FOR THE POLICB AND NATURE ATc.JEBBL H£:\DQXJAHTSRS The policemen and nature for duty with patrol cars will remain at Jebel Headquarters while off duty. 2. In the event of an alarm they will at once turn out and proceed under the orders of the officer in charge of the Field to the point of alarm. If the officer in charge is himself on patrol they must await his return. 3. In addition to the above, there will be one head natur and three naturs in the Jebel Keadquartars plus one spare natur. Their duty is to provide a sentry at all hours of the day and night at Jebel Headquarters and will see that no person enters the Jebel Headquarters except the officer in charge and recog nisable inspecting officers, the Company clerk on duty there and the police and naturs provided for the Field Defence. 4.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 14th October 1939. i:y dear Prior, It may be useful if I send you a brief account of what we have been doing in Bahrain since the war started. 2. Our first object was to ensure that a defence plan against sabotage was put into effect. Working on the lines of the Air Officer Commanding’s Appreciation regarding the Defence of Bahrain” we made various preparations before war began and the plan went into operation about two hours after we had heard of the declaration of war. We found that the recommended plan would, not quite work so far as the Oil Com pany’s premises were concerned, and though the Company put a great many men on the task to begin with, inevitably they soon began to want them back. Also after the first flush of enthu siasm had faded, many of the Europeans and Americans engaged on Refinery and Field protection began to get bored, to argue about the effectiveness of our plans*, and in the absence of ^ Black, the Chief Local Representative (who had been called up for Naval Control Service work in Basra), the American heads of the Company here found themselves up against a great many personnel difficulties. There were a certain number of English men who were convinced that they alone knew how to win the war and were determined to show them at home exactly how to do it; there were others whose main object in life was to make use of this opportunity to cut short their contracts and get back to England /- The Honourable Major C.G. Prior, C.I.E., . . % ' 9 Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Kuwait.i - 2 - England; and there were some Americans who made themselves rather tiresome. The latter were disposed of f and with the arrival of the declaration of the wishes of His Majesty’s Government in regard to oil employees remaining at their posts a better spirit prevailed. Even so there was still quite a lot of bad feeling in the Oil Camp, fostered by some of the more undesirable employees. At the same time the Bahrain Police and Naturs proved to be rather poor material when removed from the loving care and constant attention of Belgrave. After a great deal of discussion# and experiment however we have now got a workable defence plan in operation, which should provide a good standard of protection against sabotage and is not unduly expensive in personnel. Internal operational protection in the Pwefinery has been very greatly improved; and I forward with this letter, in case you like to see them, copies of the detailed orders for police protection both at the Refinery and in the Field, and of the additional precautions enjoined upon operators carrying out their daily task. We still hope for further improvements as our material flood-lights on the Refinery fence by powerful search-lights and then to re-locate the flood-lights in the darker parts inside the Refinery. The Company are going ahead with concrete protective works round their main wells, and will, we hope, shortly receive some patent valves which automatically shut off flow in case of damage to the top of the well; and we are getting in motor bicycles from India for the Police to speed up the patrol work at present done by the Camel Corps. All these improvements will serve to reduce the number of European per sonnel; police and naturs engaged, and to conserve the Company's transport w£lch, I am afraid, is not really up to 24-hour-a-day resources increase, e«g. we shall soon be able to replace the patrol /-</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000060_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/703</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000060</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/703</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 28/16 I Defence measures in the Gulf – Bahrain’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-26T21:06:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (154 folios)</extent><extent>The file’s contents are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest item at the front to the latest at the end.
