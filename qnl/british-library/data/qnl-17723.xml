He had then returned to Daman where he had managed to manouevre past the Blockade by the Bahrein fleet and visit his garrison, but that on departure he came under attack from one of the boats commanded by Shaikh Ahmed ben Suleman [Aḥmad bin Suleman] (nephew of Shaikh Abdoola [ʻAbd Allāh ibn Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah]) and that a desperate struggle ensued before Rahma ben Jabir set light to the magazines on board his vessel and destroyed both boats, leaving only Shaikh Ahmed and a few followers as survivors of the incident., which it was estimated took 300 lives.The letter concludes by observing that Rahma ben Jabir's brother Bashire was still in control of the fort at Deman, but that it was unlikely he would be able to hold out there for long following his brother's death.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024197023.0x00008c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
