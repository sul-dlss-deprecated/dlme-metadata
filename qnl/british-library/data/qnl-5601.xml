On the question of agencies, the problem is of course an old one, in that many of the smaller British exporters can hardly afford to pay for a separate agent in each small country. Nevertheless there is no doubt that the system of appointing a Regional Agent to cover a number of countries has been rather overdone in the laddie East, and the recent Goodwill Trade Mission to Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Cyprus, have strongly recommended British exporters to appoint a separate agent for each country. After all, it is only common sense tnat an agent in Kuwait must know more about the local market than any agent in Baghdad or Cairo, There may, however, be some cases where other arrangements are justified owing to the small volume of trade, or for other reasons. 3* We shall certainly take steps to inform the British exporters mentioned in paragraph 3 of the despatch, that their Agency policy for Kuwait is provoking adverse reactions. We should also like to give the subject rather wider ventilation and at the same time to try and improve the knowledge of British Exporters generally on commercial conditions and possibilities in the Protectorate. Colonel Hay is probably right when he says in paragraph 6 that British exporters are ill-informed on this subject, 4* One of the best ways of doing this would be to publish a short article in the Board of Trade Journal, and it so happens that for some months past we have been issuing in that paper one such article every v/eek on commercial possibilities in a given country. I think therefore it would be a great help if Colonel Hay could draft an article on Kuwait, and in order to show him the type of article which is required, I enclose a first draft which has been prepared by our Commercial Secretary at Jedda, on Saudi Arabia which is now being vetted for publication. It would of course be very easy, in the case of Kuwait, to include a strong recommendation that separate agents be appointed for that territory. 5. As regards the question of future correspondence on commercial matters between the Protectorate and London, we would welcome the suggestion that Colonel Hay should write to us direct and suggest that he should send a copy of each despatch to the India Office and also one to the Commercial Relations and Treaties Department of the Bear'd of Trade. It would of course be convenient to conduct this correspondence under a special series of reference numbers. 6. We will certainly arrange to send our memoranda in future direct to the Residency at Bahrain with copies sent direct to the Political Agencies at Kuwait and Bahrain. E.A.K.

The same merchant when he made enquiries about Bedford Trucks was told to apply to Alexandria. Messrs. B.q. •Cycles jjimit^d Birmingham told him to apply to Baghdad for their products. The U.K« Tobacco Company merely informed him that they had allotted an agency for Kuwait elsewhere than in Kuwait. (ii) Another merchant who applied to Austin Motors Company Limited, Birmingham* was advised to contact the Company* s distributor in Jeuda. (iii) Another merchant applied to Messrs. Rootes Limited asking for an kgmej for Huaber cars. Ho spent ov.r £50 in telegrams without receiving aty acknowled^nent. He was finally told he had boon appointed as Bub-dealt-r to a dealer in Palestine. The Political \gent, Kuw.iit, himself, when he applied to Messrs.

The merchant subsequently heard frem the Union Trading Company that they were represented in Kuwait by their a^ent Mr. Jarneel Salman at Baghdad. 2. hile L was in Kuwait, lusuf al Ghanim, one of the most important and richest merchants in the- town came to see we and said he was interested in importing engines for dhows, electrical machinery and flour mills for Saudi Arabia but was quite unable to obtain any direct contact with British firms. * * 3. he following is a list of British firms not previously mentioned in this letter who are reported by the Political Agent to have given agencies outside Kuwait to cover the Bhaikhdcms * Chomia products Ltd., London.

Dear Glutton, As T think you know, the exports of manufactured tooacco from this country have fallen heavily, partly because Falaya end other important markets have disappeared, and partly because we have got the trade to cease exporting to India, South Africa and various other countries that can’ supply themselves. One of the principal remaining destinations of our exports, is Arabia and the quantity going either through Aden or into the ersian Gulf is greater than before the war. 1 The maintenance of commercial exports of manufactured tobacco costs ua&gt;dollars and shipping to bring the leaf here, and we are anxious that no unnecessary export shall go on. I have heard from the trade that wartime' conditions bring increased prosperity to many of the i 2 h fu i 4 &amp;nt ' S ° r Arabia &gt; who thereupon seek to spend some of their new purchasing power on British cigaret es. This may be a sufficient explanation of the increased demand, but I am doubtful whether there is any need for us to continue to export these large quantities, and I snail be glad to know whether, in your view, there will be any objection to our telling manufacturers that they must stop exporting to Arabia, except cigarettes- and tobacco for the troops, and possibly, normal quantities to Aden.

Uy dear Hay, 56’i8 6 th April 1938. 1938 J To I was interested to see the other day that the Croveniment of India have stated that Indian interests in the Persian G-ulf had declined and were still declining. Ihough this is no doubt true on the Persian side, I think it will be worth while to consider wheter it is strictly correct on the Arabian side of the Gulf. Quite apar. from the importance to India of the air route and oil, I should like to direct attention to an increasing market for Indian products and a small but potentially increasing field of eoiployment for Indians. 2. it is interesting to observe that the Mother lands found Bahrain alone of sufficient interest commer cially to send a Trade Commessioner he~e on his way to Java. His visit happened a few days after a very live director of the Hansa Line had spent a week in Bahrain, ihese visits show how other countries regard the pros pects in these parts. 3. At the present moment Bahrain is the only lace where there is an oil field and a refinery in full unning order but the Americans have struck oil in Hasa, ust across the water from Bahrain, and they are going head hard there. There are preliminary reports that il nas been found in Kuwait and the geologists at any rate are extremely hopeful about ^atar. oil brings trade and even i at the present moment Bahrain alone is good for imports to the value of from one and a half to two crores ..... Major W.R. Hay, G.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi. £crores of rupees foor annum; while if these new oil fit. come to anything, as we expect they will do, there will be important ne- markets coming into existence in the next two or three years, possibly supplemented later by other 'oil-begotten* markets on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat. 4* At the present moment the Japanese hold a predominant share of the Bahrain market, but anti-Japanese feeling here is pretty strong; and it would be reasonably enough to use this feeling to help in diverting a propor tion of the Japanese business here, provided India can of India have for developing overseas trade, as I do not possess departmental lists here apart from our own. But I imagine there is some organisation of the sort, and I definitely think it would be worth while for an expert to be sent here to see wha- can be done about improving Indian trade. It is, of course, no use leaving things like this to xaia amateurs of the Political service who have neither the time, the knowledge nor the experience to do anything much for the promotion of trade. 6 . There is also a fair amount of scope in the oil fields for Indians with some mechanical training. We do not want the adventurirg ty e coming up the Julf to look for work - they do definite harm to Indian interests - and it is true that at present the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California txxtixxx Arabian Standard Oil Company seem to be unable to get hold of the right type. But I believe that Mr. Thornberg, ho is a vice-president of the Oil Company, will be visiting India shortly and will be wanting to get into touch with people who c.^n help him to find Indians of a better type for employment both in Bahrain and Hasa on skilled work which so far is beyond offer similar goods at reasonable prices. 5. I am not sure what organisation the Grovernmtnt the ca acitythe capacity of the local Arab, it is not a big field of employment, but it is useful enough in ttijs way, and 1 hope you may be able to tell me where he should go for x helpful advice in India. * I am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Agent, hahram. fours sincerely, Sd.

In the meantime I am to request you to be good enough to convey to Mr. Pyman an expression of appreciation of his work manlike and comprehensive survey of the various aspects of the market in Bahrain.

To The Comptroller-General, Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, London, S.W.l* Sir, I have the honour to enclose an interesting and useful report by Mr. Acting Vice-Consul Pyman on his recent commercial visit to Bahrain. 2. There is no doubt that prosperity is gradually returning to Bahrain, for I am told that the Ladies of the ancient profession are buying silk to a considerable extent. This is the best local touchstone of good or evil times J 3. I would emphasise that the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf, of wnich Bahrain is the chief commercial centre, offers a market which is likely to expand rapidly in the next few years. The oil field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company is being exploited with energy and the Company’s Refinery is already being increased in size. Oil has been found in Hasa, though to what extent is not yet certain. Petroleum Concessions Limited has obtained a concession in Qatar and concessions are being soughtwmmmmmm 2 by the same Company all along the Trucial Coast, This market is one in wnich, especially if further oil develop ment take place, there will be a source of considerable buying power from the wages paid by the oil companies and the gradual filtering of the royalty money into the local bazaars. It seems worth the attention of British manufac turers to establish themselves while the market is still cars and accessories, wireless sets, and sugar, and I would recommend that the attention of manufacturers of these goods snould be drawn to the future prospects of the market.

From ^ Acting British Vice-Consul, To: The iion'ble Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ana Acting British Consul-General, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to report that, in accordance with pur instructions, I have recently visited Bahrain as part of my commercial tour of the Gulf, leaving Bushire on August 26th ana returning on September 9th. 2. .curing my stay in Bahrain I was the guest of the assistant Political Agent, who was at great pains to show me every side of the economic life of Bahrain and to introduce me to every one who could be of assistance in my enquiries. 3. I received the impression that the effects of the depression in the pearl industry are now being substantially offset by the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company, which, as well as paying large sums in wages, makes considerable purchases locally, hioreover, considerable sums are now being received by the shaikh of Bahrain in royalties, much of which is spent locally; this source of purchasing power is likely to increase. This situation is reflected in the figures for imports which were 24.71 greater in 1935-6 than in the preceding year; these figures do not include the Company's imports of technical equipment. Luring the period which elapsed between the beginning of the decline in the pearl industry and the development of the Gil Company's activities to their present extent the^ulk of the population had no alternative but tQbuy the very cheapest goods, regardless of quality, and this opportunity the Japanese /were! ^ -2- © (g) were quick to take, now some measure of prosperity is returning to Bahrain and. there is money available for the purchase of better quality goods, ana this increasea capacity to puj coincides with a growing dissatisfaction with Japanese goods among both merchants, who find that there is little profit in them, and. the public, who find that they oo not on the whole give good service. 5. The moment seems opportune, therefore, for United kingdom manufacturers to increase considerably their share of the market. Unitea kingdom goods have a high reputation for quality and United kingdom manufacturers are respected for their straightforwardness. It is essential, however, for British goons to be pushed by energetic local agents; the public are apt to regard the words 'English^ and ’’expensive 1 * as synonomous, and 'expensive” is apt to carry the meaning of 'too expensive to be worth buying'; nevertheless, an appreciation of the value of quality does exist and could be turned to account by United kingdom exporters if the quality of the attention of the public. 6 . 1 have the honour to enclose thirty reports on various goods coula be forced on ( 6-eu &lt;\ff cUc'a~f GLux) OjuS. /OO /tJM £ 1 aspects of the market.

COPY 26291/1936 British Consulate G-eneral B w ,, &gt;f the Persian Gulf I spent a few days at Muscat. I did not come across any specific cases effecting British trade and trading methods, but business was extremely dull and this state of affairs will doubtless be reflected in the next trade returns. 2. As elsewhere in the Persian Gulf Japanese goods pre dominate owing to price. The piece goods trade is in the hands of the Japanese and is likely to remain so. There is practically no demand for high class goods but only essentials and these must be cheap owing to the poverty of the population whose wants are few. At present there are no openings for new lines of British goods. 3. I also visited Matrah - a small village on the coast about three miles from Muscat. This is considered to be the trade centre rather than Muscat. The British India steamers do not discharge cargo there but German ships do. Matrah is a larger place than Muscat. Here again Japanese goods - especially piece goods - predominate on account of their cheap ness. The whole place looks most unattractive and poverty stricken. 4 . In Muscat H.M.V. Gramophones are on sale. This year about 30 have been sold. They play records of oriental music made in India. The Gramophones themselves come from the United Kingdom. 3. There is at present no opening for wireless receiving sets. They would probably find a ready sale if electricity were available or if batteries could be recharged on the spot. 6. Import duties into Muscat were increased about 18 months ago. They now range from 10^ on foodstuffs to 20^ on imported alcoholic drinks. This has not brought about an increase in the retail price of Japanese goods as the higher duties have been counteracted by a reduction in export prices from Japan. 7. In general it may be said that trade with Muscat is not likely to increase to any appreciable extent until the earning power of the inhabitants is raised as a result of higher prices for exports.

I left Bushire on the 18th November and arrived back on the 16th December, my tour having lasted exactly four weeks. At each of the above mentioned places I enjoyed the hospitality of the Political Agents who did everything possible for my com fort and spared no pains to help me in my investigations. I interviewed various merchants and at Bahrain the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the Customs and Port Officer and the Manager of the Eastern Bank were good enough to give me information on different aspects of trade in the Island. In fact everybody concerned was only too ready to discuss matters with me. Besides the three questions reported upon separately the facts which I have obtained and the impressions gained will form the nucleus of the next economic report on conditions in the Persian Gulf. During my tour 1 maae personal contact with many officials and merchants which will prove most useful in the future. It is by the aid of such contacts together with the impressions gained on an actual tour that trade tendencies can best be guaged and fresh trade openings brought to the notice of British exporters without any unnecessary delay. I feel that my tour just concluded has been of great value to me; it has enabled me to see things for myseli, to obtain first-hand information about actual trade matters, and to judge of future possibilities of trade expansion. Indeed in my opinion such a tour is an indispensable preliminary to the presentation of an accurate picture of trade conditions in the Gulf area as a whole.

To foster British overseas trade, the Department controls the following Services of Commercial Intelligence Officers: — The Trade Commissioner and Imperial Trade Correspondent Services. At the present time there are 16 Trade Commissioners’ offices. T are situated, four in Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnip two each in South Africa (Capetown, Johannesburg), Australia (Sydney, Melbourne), India (Calcutta and Bombay—to cover also Ceylon), and British West Indies (Trinidad, Jamaica) ; and one each in New Zealand (Wellington), Irish Free State (Dublin), Malaya (Singapore) and British East Africa (Nairobi). The Trade Commissioners have the assistance of Imperial Trade Corre spondents at a number of important centres. There are also Imperial Trade Correspondents in those parts of the Empire to which Trade Commissioners have not been appointed. (a) The Commercial Diplomatic Service attached to the British Diplomatic Missions. There are 38 Commercial Diplomatic posts situated in all the more im portant foreign markets of the world. The members of the Commercial Diplomatic Service are styled “ Commercial Counsellors ” in the highest grade, and “ Commercial Secretaries ” in the three lower grades. They are members of the staff of the British Embassy or Legation in which they serve. The Commercial Diplomatic Officer has general supervision over the commercial work of the consular officers in his area and, with the co-operation of these two services, a complete network of Government commercial representatives is thrown over foreign countries. Particular attention has been given to the commercial side of consular work since the re-organisation of the service. In certain countries where no Commercial Diplomatic Officer is stationed the senior Consular Officer undertakes duties of a similar character. The British Consular Service in the Persian Gulf is represented by Lieut.- Colonel T. C. W. Fowle, C.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. Further information regarding the above services can be obtained on application to the Department of Overseas Trade 35, Old Queen Street, London, S.W.l. Members of United Kingdom firms are urged to call upon the Department’s representative abroad when they visit an overseas country. It is also important that they should make a point of their representatives abroad keeping in close touch with the Department’s officers. It should be understood that the views expressed in annual reports are the views of the officers themselves, and are not necessarily in all respects those of the Department. 1. In the Empire. 2.

Currency. —In Bahrain, Muscat and Kuwait the Indian rupee is most commonly used for transactions with foreign countries. The monetary unit in Persia is the rial which in 1933-34 (21st March to 20th March) had an average value of 82 to the pound sterling. Banks. —There are branches of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Bushire, Mohammerah, Abadan, Ahwaz and Basra; of the National Bank of Pei^^ in Bushire, Bandar Abbas, Mohammerah and Ahwaz; of the Eastern Bflp in Basra and Bahrain; and of the Ottoman Bank in Basra. Weights and Measures. —On the Arab side of the Gulf English weights and measures are generally used for trade with foreign countries. In Persia the unit of weight is the man which varies from place to place, but what is known as the Tabriz man is the most generally used. One Tabriz man is equal to 6 , 5456 lbs., and one kharvar (100 Tabriz man) is equal to approximately six hundredweight. Merchants who have dealings with foreign countries are usually familiar also with English weights and measures. Steamship Services. —The British India Steam Navigation Company runs a weekly fast mail service between Bombay and Basra, leaving Bombay on Thursdays, Karachi on Sundays, Bushire on Wednesdays, and Mohammerah on Thursdays. Ships arrive at Basra on Thursdays and leave on Saturdays for the return voyage. The weekly slow mail service is scheduled to leave Bombay on Wednesdays for Karachi, Muscat, Bandar Abbas, Henjam, Bahrain, Bushire, Kuwait, Mohammerah and Basra, and calls on alternate weeks either at Gwadur, Jask, Sharjah and Dibai, or at Pasni, Charbar and Lingah. The time taken from Bombay to Basra is approximately 14 days. Rates of freight can be obtained on application to Messrs. Mackinnon Mackenzie &lt;fc Co., Bombay, or from the Company’s office in London. The Strick line runs a monthly service of cargo steamers between the United Kingdom and the Gulf Ports. The German Hansa line also maintains a monthly service from Hamburg and the Italian Lloyd Triestino Company has recently started a two monthly service from Trieste. Air Services. —The weekly service of Imperial Airways flying between London and Singapore calls at Basra, Kuwait, Bahrain, Sharjah and Gwadur. The aeroplanes of the K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Air Lines) and the Air France flying weekly between London and the Far East' call at Bushire and Jask. Climatic conditions. —The climate of the Gulf is on the whole fairly uniform. The hot weather lasts from May to October and these months are unpleasant chiefly on account of the relatively high humidity which is general throughout the Gulf and which attains its maximum at Bahrain. The winter months are cold and dry. English residents normally wear ordinary English clothing from early November to mid-April and light cotton clothing during the rest of the year, when sun helmets are also worn. Visitors who arrive between seasons must be prepared for sudden changes of temperature.5 REPORT ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE PERSIAN GULF October, 1934 I.—GENERAL REVIEW OF TRADE, 1933-34. This report is intended to give a general view of trade conditions- in the Persian Gulf. The principal ports are dealt with in separate sections, but Basra is only included in as far as it affects the trade of the Gulf as a whole. Very different trade conditions prevailed on the Arab and Persian sides of the Gulf. On the Arab side, customs duties ranged from 4 per cent, to 15 per cent, but there were no restrictions on the quantities of merchandise imported and exported and the statis tics for the year (1st April, 1933 to 31st March, 1934) show that the total volume of trade, though still far below the level of five or six years ago, increased slightly in comparison with that of the previous year. On the Persian side, though no statistics have yet been published,} it is doubtful if there will be an increase owing to the numerous regulations which remained in force during the year. In addition to the difficulties of a quota system and the payment of customs duties and road tax, merchants importing into Persia w T ere faced with the necessity of procuring certificates of export before they could obtain certificates of import and when importing certain classes of goods, including motor cars and accessories, woollens and leather, of first purchasing foreign exchange from the Govern ment at unfavourable rates. The monopolies of opium, sugar and matches contributed still further to their difficulties and made it impossible for them to carry on normal business, with the result that money became generally scarce and only goods of the cheapest quality found a market. On the Arab side money was also scarce, but for different reasons, of which the most impor tant was the continued depression in the pearl trade. This shortage of money and consequent demand for cheapness with little regard to quality, whilst detrimental to British interests, [ was a tremendous help to Japan in her efforts to establish a strong ^ commercial position in the Gulf. Her goods were almost invariably 1 cheaper than those of her rivals and in addition were brought to the notice of merchants by Japanese agents who were extremely active in visiting and carrying on trade propaganda in the various towns in the Gulf. Furthermore, Japanese traders were willing to import goods on their own account and dispose of them afterwards 27442 A 4/ /- 6 to merchants as and when opportunity offered. The progress in the sale of Japanese goods will be examined in more detail in the sections dealing with the various markets, but, in general, it may be said that her piece goods, chinaware, glassware and haberdashery predominated throughout the Gulf ; that her cement competed with cements from the United Kingdom, Italy, Yugoslavia and the Baltic States, but was not always successful on account of its inferior quality ; that her matches shared the market on the Arab side with those of Sweden and the U.S.S^b^ and were cheaper than either ; that considerable quantities of r^i brought by Japanese steamers from (Jjapan, were sold at low prices in Bahrain and Kuwait and adversely affected the sales of Indian rice in these markets. No less remarkable than the advance of Japanese trade was the decline of Soviet Union trade due, in part, to the fact that Soviet Union goods, like those of other nations, were to a large extent submerged by the deluge of Japanese goods which descended upon the markets on both sides of the Gulf from 193*2 onwards, and, in part, to the economic disputes which took place between the U.S.S.R. and Persia during the last two years. Following the ratification of a commercial treaty between the two countries in October, 1931, Soviet Union trading concerns w r ere re-organized and centralized, banks were established at Mohammerah and Bushire and, for a time, Soviet Union goods, aided by the mono polies which had been granted to them for the import of sugar and matches, continued to pour into the Persian ports. Towards the end of 1932, complaints were made against Soviet I nion trading methods and the alleged excess of Soviet Union imports over exports, which culminated in the spring of 1933 in an almost complete cessation of trade between the two countries. Although some measures of agreement have since been arrived at, up to the time of writing no real resumption of trade in the Gulf was apparent. ( The United Kingdom and India both lost ground heavily in the piece goods market, but the former was able to hold its own in the sale of machinery, where some appreciation of quality as opposed to considerations merely of original cost was still in evi dence. The high quality of British cement was also appreciated, but competition in this market was extremely keen and orders were well divided amongst a number of nations. British motor cars have not so far been able to compete success fully with the well established American makes. This is to be regretted in view of the large number of cars which are imported annually through Basra and the Persian ports. If however, Fmted Kingdom manufacturers wish to obtain a share of this market, they must introduce cars wdiich will compare favour ably in pi ice with American cars of the same horse poweri 7 and at the same time be able to withstand the rough handling and rough roads to which they are normally subjected. It would therefore be essential before attempting anything in this direction to carry out a careful study of local conditions and to pay attention to the questions of accessories and credit. The fact that spare parts for the better known American cars in this area are readily available and that some manufacturers oblige ^heir agents to carry certain minimum stocks is a great point in idieir favour with the local purchaser. United States manufacturers, are often prepared to give their agents long terms of credit which are passed on to the customer and this is a further cause of popularity. Imports of British sugar, which appeared to be making consider able progress two years ago both through Basra into ‘Iraq as well as through the ports on the Arab side of the Gulf, showed a disappointing decline. In ‘Iraq, the amount fell from 9,157 tons or ‘24-2 per cent, of the total in 1932-33 to 6,404 tons or 15-3 per cent, of the total in 1933-34. Meanwhile the imports of Belgian and Butch sugar increased and Egyptian sugar also became popular. The reasons for the set back to British sugar in Bahrain and Kuwait will be examined in the sections dealing with these Sheikhdoms. In Persia, the decision to allow the U.S.S.K. only a portion of the sugar quota instead of the whole, as previously, resulted in large quantities being imported from Belgium, Holland and Java, but the varying restrictions greatly handicapped merchants in order ing from abroad. Up to the present no British sugar has appeared in the South of Persia, but it is possible that there would be an opening in this market in the event of further relaxation of the existing regulations. India retained an almost complete monopoly of the import of i tea on the Arab side, though some Java tea appeared in Bahrain/ and was imported in large quantities through Basra into ‘Iraq. I In Persia supplies came mostly from Calcutta, Colombo and; Batavia. Shipping.—The chief features of shipping in the Gulf during the » last two years have been the withdrawal of Soviet Union steamers / and the steady progress made by the German Hansa line. The cessation of Soviet Union shipping since the summer of 1933 was due, in part, to the fact that the U.S.S.R. took little in the way of exports from either ‘Iraq or Persia and consequently her ships were without cargo on the homeward journey. The withdrawal of Soviet Union steamers did not, however, prevent U.S.S.R. goods, consisting mostly of matches, glass and porcelain ware, from arriving either in chartered Greek steamers running between the Black Sea and Basra or in Strick boats after transhipment at Fort Said. ■8 Hansa steamers obtained good cargoes both on the inward and out ward voyages. They brought principally loaf sugar, glassware, steel sheets and iron bars from Antwerp and general merchandise from Hamburg and took away grain and dates from Basra and dates, dried fruits, cotton and gum from the Persian ports. Formerly machinery and material from the United States of America for the Bahrain Petroleum Co. Ltd., were transhipped at Hamburg and brought to Bahrain by Hansa steamers but latterly such signments have been transhipped at a United Kingdom port ani^^ brought by Strick steamers. | Towards the end of 1933 Japanese steamers made their first appearance and since then some six or seven steamers have made trips to the Gulf. Their principal cargoes were cement for Basra and Mohammerah, cement and rice for Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, and piece goods, cement and glassware for Mohammerah. Complaints have been made against Japanese traders both in Persia and ‘Iraq that they import without exporting and the absence of cargo for the return journey may cause their shipping to fail, as Soviet Union shipping has failed. Latterly, however, Japanese steamers have been taking large quantities of raw cotton from Mohammerah and, if this continues, it is possible that the difficulty will be overcome. Swedish steamers brought cement and railway material to Bandar Shahpur and cement to Basra, where it was reported that it was proposed to send out a steamer to the Gulf once every month. An Italian shipping company started a two monthly service to the Gulf ports early in 1934 to be carried out by the motor vessel “ Assiria ”. Cargoes consisted mostly of Yugo-Slav cement and Austrian sugar. In spite of foreign competition, British shipping appeared to be holding its own and it will be noticed from the table of shipping for Bushire which is annexed that British ships carried over 50 per cent, of the total number of packages imported into and approxi mately 85 per cent, of the total number of packages exported from that port in the year 1933-34. An important part of the trade of the Gulf is carried on by native sailing vessels.Table III. Exports. Steamship lines. No. of Packages. Percentage of total. No. of Packages.

The vast majority of the inhabitants of the Gulf live a hand to mouth existence and generally prefer the cheap article to one which is more expensive, even though the service given by the latter may be proportionately greater. The necessity of studying conditions on the spot cannot be too heavily emphasised, in particular with regard to the Arab side of the Gulf, where the needs of the inhabitants differ considerably from those of Persia and ‘Iraq. Now that Imperial Airways run a service which calls regularly at Bahrain, and at Gwadur in the Sultanate of Muscat, and which makes frequent calls at Kuwait, it should be possible for British manufacturers to send representatives to visit these places and get in touch with reliable and energetic agents who would be willing to undertake the marketing and sale of their goods. The need for advertisement and propaganda is as essential in the Gulf as elsewhere. Many merchants are badly informed about goods of foreign manufacture and if well supplied with illustrated pamphlets will frequently be induced to place an order. Wrappers and packing should be attractive and even dazzling and, where the goods are intended for sale on the Arab side of the Gulf, the inscrip tions should as far as possible be in Arabic. Goods manufactured in the United Kingdom should be clearly marked as such. There have been instances of foreign goods being made to resemble so nearly British goods that it has been difficult to distinguish between them and as the latter are generally respected for their quality, it is important that there should be no room for confusion.12 In the absence of customs statistics it is not possible to give an accurate analysis of the trade of Busbire, but details from the shipping lists, without specifying weights and values, give some idea of the general trend of imports and exports. Imports. —The number of packages of sugar (crystal and loaf) shown as having been landed at Bushire increased from 91,719 in the Persian Year 1311 (21st March, 1932—20th March, 1933) to 129,595 in the year 1312 (21st March, 1933—20th March, 1934) of cotton piece-goods from 23,039 to 26,708; of matches from 2,58^^^ to 5,923; of cement from 2,334 to 3,417. Imports of tea, which came mostly from India, declined from 9,689 packages in 1932-33 to 8,663 packages in 1933-34. Piece-goods were imported chiefly from Japan and only in small quantities from India and the United Kingdom. Crystal sugar came in recent months almost entirely from Java and loaf sugar from Antwerp and Marseilles. The amount of cement imported through Bushire was small compared with the amount imported through Mohammerah, but recently 1,000 tons were landed by an Italian steamer for the construction of a new sugar factory near Shiraz. Approximately forty motor cars, mostly of American manufac ture, were imported during each of the years 1932-33 and 1933-34 but the number of lorries and trucks increased from 15 in the former year to 77 in the latter, and this increase may be expected to continue in view of the Government’s decision last January to make importers purchase dollars at the official rate (rials 28.28 to the dollar) for only 20 per cent, of the value of motor cars and lorries instead or for the whole value as previously. Exports. —The amount of tobacco exported fell from 28,472 bales in 1932-33 to 600 bales in 1933-34. In October, 1934, however, a shipment of 18,000 bales was made by Italian steamer to Beirut. Reckoning in packages, exports of gum tragacanth increased from 11,703 in 1932-33 to 20,550 in 1933-34, whilst those of skins, dried fruits and almonds also showed an increase. The principal countries to which gum was exported were the United Kingdom, India, Germany and the United States of America. Owing to the lack of demand from the European and American markets there was a big falling off in the export of carpets— 1,808 bundles in 1933-34 as compared with 2,700 in the previous year. III.—MOHAMMERAH. General. —Mohammerah, situated at the confluence of the Karun River and the Shatt-al-Arab, has in recent years become the fore most Persian port in the Gulf. In 1932-33 the value of merchandise imported amounted to over 112 million Rials and it is expected that the 1933-34 figures, when published, will exceed that amount. Exports are also expected to show an increase over the 1932-33 figure of 17 million Rials.Ten miles to the south-east of Mohammerah on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab is Abadan, where the refinery and offices of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are situated, whilst some 40 miles to the east on the Khor Musa is the new port of Bandar Shahpur. A few years ago it was thought that the development of Bandar Shahpur might deprive Mohammerah of its importance, but such a contingency is now considered unlikely, at any rate for some years to come, in view of the still inadequate arrangements for landing and transporting cargo at the former port. At present Bandar Shahpur is used almost exclusively for importing Government material and stores, whilst almost all general cargo passes through Mohammerah. Landing facilities. —Steamers with cargo for Mohammerah and Ahwaz anchor in the Shatt-al-Arab and discharge into barges and dhows which convey their loads, if they are for Mohammerah, to the Customs’ jetty for examination and subsequent forwarding up country by rail or river, if they are for Ahwaz, by river direct to the Customs house in Ahwaz. Transport.— Rates of transport vary according to the season and are considerably higher in winter than in summer. The normal rate between Mohammerah and Tehran by lorry lies between 180 Rials and 200 Rials per kharvar, whilst goods forwarded by river to Ahwaz, by rail from Alrwaz to Salehabad, the present rail head, and by road from there to Tehran cost approximately 20 Rials less per kharvar but take from 13 to 15 days to reach their destination as compared with 5 days by lorry all the way. Trade. —Although general trade conditions in Mohammerah are probably better than in other Persian ports in the Gulf, merchants here, as elsewhere, found themselves severely restricted by the Government regulations. Apart from the activities of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., which lie outside the scope of this report, there are no important industries in the district. There is an occasional demand for machinery such as electric generating plant, motor boat engines*, cranes, water pumps, etc., and in this line British goods are generally preferred on account of their superior quality, but it must be remembered that foreign machinery is also available and that price is as often as not the factor which determines the placing of an order. In Mohammerah itself there has been talk of establishing flour mills, also of importing machinery for soap making and the weaving of woollen goods. Imports. —Piecegoods are imported in large quantities from Japan, sometimes in exchange for raw cotton, and in lesser quanti ties from India and the Lnited Kingdom. lea comes fromColombo, Calcutta and iJatavia ; motor cars, trucks and accessories almost exclusively from the United States. Sugar is imported from Antwerp, Marseilles, Fort Said and Hamburg. Belgian K.T. loaf- sugar is the most popular, on account of its hardness, which appeals to the Persians who are accustomed to suck sugar with their tea. Considerable quantities of building material including cement, roofing, irons joists, paint, etc., are imported in reply to a steady demand from up country. The Uni ted* Kingdom continues to export such material but there is keen competition from Japan and Italy in the cement market and from Belgium for the supply of iron and steelwork. Exports. —Bates grow abundantly in the region round Moham- merah and are exported on a big scale to Europe, the United States, South Africa and India during the season, which extends from the middle of August to the middle of November. In 1933 the total amount exported was estimated at 15,000 tons. Wheat and barley are also grown in the district but not in sufficient quantity for export. Raw cotton is exported to Antwerp and Hamburg and latterly in large consignments—over 10,000 bales since November, 1933— by Japanese steamers to Japan. Carpets, skins and gum are exported in small quantities to the United Kingdom, the United States, India and Germany and nuts and dried fruits to Germanv and Belgium IV.—BANDAR ABBAS. General. —Six or seven years ago Bandar Abbas was a busy dis tributing centre for Kerman, Yezd, Lar and other towns in the interior and the total volume of its trade amounted to over a million pounds per annum. This has gradually dwindled until in recent years it amounts to less than half that total. The latest figures show that the decline is continuing and this must be attributed to the difficult economic conditions prevailing in the country and also to the tendency, which has been mentioned elsewhere, for trade to move towards Mohammerah, Bandar Shahpur and Ahwaz. Landing facilities, etc. —The landing arrangements at Bandar Abbas remain primitive and inadequate. Steamers anchor some 2 miles out and goods are unloaded into dhows which convey them to the customs' pier. Some improvement has recently been effected in the accommodation at the customs by the building of additional warehouses. Transport. —A motor road now connects Bandar Abbas with Kerman and the bulk of the goods is transported up country by lorry, though in some cases, where time is not a factor, animal transport15 is preferred on account of its cheapness. The average rates during the year 1933-34 by the two means of transport were Rials 150 and Rials 95 respectively per kharvar to Kerman. Trade. Ihe total trade of the district, which includes, for customs purposes, Bandar Abbas, Charbar, Jask, Khamir, Kishm and Tiab, aggregated Rials 37,364,626 (Imports, Rials 29,942,118; Exports, Rials 7,422,808), as compared with Rials 46,467,700 (Imports, Rials 37,521,200. Exports, Rials 8,946,500), in the “previous year, showing a decrease of Rials 7,579,082 in imports of Rials 1,523,992, in exports and of Rials 9,103,074, in the total trade. Comparative tables showing the values of exports and imports to and from the various countries in 1932-33 and ]933-34 are annexed. Imports.— It will be noticed that imports of Soviet Union piece- goods decreased in value by almost 70 per cent., those from Japan remained steady, whilst those from India increased by approxi mately 50 per cent. The value of United Kingdom piece-goods, now amounting to a very small percentage of the total, diminished by nearly 45 per cent. Imports of twists and yarns from India increased from approxi mately 8£ million Rials in 1932-33 to 11^- million Rials in 1933-34, whilst imports from Japan decreased from 12 million Rials to 3f million Rials. The effects of the withdrawal of the monopoly on sugar, which had previously been held by the U.S.S.R., are seen in the big decline of imports from that country and in the large supplies of sugar which entered from Belgium, Java and Holland. Considerable quantities of silver bullion arrived at Bandar Abbas from the United Kingdom in transit for India via Zahidan during the year 1933-34 and high profits were made on account of no duty being levied on goods imported into India by this route. In May, 1934, however, a total embargo was placed on such importations. Small quantities of British machinery still found their way into Bandar Abbas. Machinery said to be of English origin has been imported from Bombay for a new carding and spinning mill which is being erected in the town. Exports. —Exports of carpets declined from over 2£ million Rials in 1932-33 to under £ million Rials in 1933-34 the decline being due to lack of demand in the United Kingdom, India and the United States of America. Exports of raw cotton diminished from Rials 1,679,570 to Rials 1,369,299. The total output of the red oxide of iron mines in the Island of Hormuz was 3,575 tons and was shipped to the following places:—Philadelphia, 1,800 tons; Avonmouth, 1,075 tons; Bombay, 600 tons; Calcutta, 400 tons./' / ' 18 V.—BAHRAIN. G-eneral. —The Bahrain group consists of one main island and a number of smaller islands off the north-east coast of Arabia. The main island, generally known as Manama after the principal town of the state, has an area of 208 square miles and is 30 miles in length and 10 miles in width. Of the smaller islands, Muhurraq, situated at a short distance from the north-east corner of the main island, is the most important and has an area of square miles. The state is ruled by an Arab Sheikh in special treaty relations' with His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are represented by a Political Agent. The total population of the islands is estimated at 120,000. Cultivation. —Owing to lack of water and the rocky nature of the soil, only a small proportion of the islands, approximately one twentieth of the total area, is under cultivation and this is confined for the most part to the northern end of the main island, where in recent years numerous artesian wells have been introduced. Transport. —Roads capable of taking motor traffic exist over the Northern part of the island ; the only one which may be termed first class connects Manama with the oil-field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, situated at a distance of some 15 miles from the town. Recent figures show that there were 102 cars and 27 lorries on the island. Taxis can be hired by visitors. Motor dhows and launches as well as sailing dhows connect the islands with each other and also with the mainland ports of Qatif and Ojair. Lauding facilities, etc. —Owing to shallow anchorage, steamers arriving at Bahrain are Obliged to lie some three or four miles from the shore and discharge their cargo into dhows. A very considerable proportion of this cargo is subsequently transhipped to the mainland. Customs. —Customs duties on imports, from which the revenue of the state is mainly derived, are levied at the rate of 5 per cent. ad valorem on general merchandise, 10 per cent, on certain “ luxury ” articles such as carpets, cycles, clocks and watches, electrical goods, furniture, gramophones, gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor cars, perfumery, toilet soap, silk goods, sewing machines, tyres and tubes, type-writers, boots and shoes, playing cards, and 15 per cent, on alcohol, tobacco and cigarettes. Transit dues at the rate of 2 per cent, are charged on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland. An export duty of 10 Rupees per bundle of hides and 2 Rupees per basket of dates is charged. The customs office is controlled by a European Director of Customs.} v 19 Currency, Banking, etc. —The Indian rupee forms the basis of all commercial transactions. The average rate of exchange during 1933-34 was Rupees 1,340 per one hundred pounds sterling. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank Limited in Manama, which transacts all classes of business, a branch office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, who also act as agents for Imperial Airways, a post office and a wireless station. Trade. —The total value of trade during the year ended the plst March, 1934, amounted to Rupees 16,029,840 and showed a slight increase over the figure for the previous year. Imports actually decreased from Rupees 9,772,360 to Rupees 9,275,040 but exports increased from Rupees 6,094,210 to Rupees 6,754,800 making a total increase of Rupees 163,270. The following table shows the value in rupees of imports from the principal countries during the last three years :— 1931-32. 1932-33. 1933-34. India ... 5,741,970 4,849,460 4,244,390 Arabia 811,190 955,400 923,240 ‘Iraq ... 847,290 667,020 854,920 Japan 500,870 777,520 831,540 Persia 720,040 460.200 600,140 Great Britain 490,820 673,980 401,700 It will be noticed that although Indian imports still predominate, they show a big decline as compared with previous years ; Japanese imports show a steady increase, whilst United Kingdom imports have decreased by over a third in the past year. Imports.— Rice, cotton goods and specie in the order mentioned are the chief items of import. India continues to be the almost sole importers of rice, though recently some 35,000 bags have been brought to Bahrain by Japanese steamers and sell in the bazaar as Japanese rice. This rice, however, is reported to have originally been bought from India by Japan in view of a threatened famine and subsequently re-exported when there was found to be an un expected surplus. In September, 1934, it was selling at 9 Rupees 4 annas for a bag of 218 lbs. and was cheaper than Calcutta rice which cost the same amount for a bag of 162 lbs. India, Japan and the United Kingdom shared the import of cotton goods, but the value of United Kingdom imports fell from Rupees 442,500 in 1932-33 to Rupees 208,460 in 1933-34. The corresponding figures for Japanese imports were Rupees 558,410 and Rupees 486,340 and for Indian imports Rupees 694,000 and Rupees 640,590. Specie was mostly imported from India and ‘Iraq. Exports. —The principal exports in order of importance in 1933-34 were gold, rice, cotton goods, pearls and specie and the principal countries to which exported, Arabia and India.20 The large amount of gold exported to India and the United King dom—Rupees 889,920 and Rupees 475,360 respectively—consisted mostly of bars obtained from melting down ornaments. A con siderable quantity of this gold is believed to have come from Persia. In recent months the flow of gold has greatly diminished. Exports of rice and cotton goods consisted mainly of transhipments to Arabia, whilst pearls and specie were exported almost exclusively to During the last few years small quantities of shells have bee exported to Germany and the United Kingdom. Dates are grown on the island and on the mainland, but the supply is not large enough or regular enough to make export on a large scale possible. dependent for a livelihood is pearl fishing. For a number of reasons this industry has fallen into a state of extreme depression during recent years and no signs of improvement are as yet visible. In the first place, economic conditions in Europe and America have led to a decrease in the demand for pearls with the result that continental buyers no longer find it worth their while to visit Bahrain every season as they did in former years. Secondly, the introduction of Japanese cultured pearls has had an adverse effect on the market for natural pearls, and, thirdly, the quality of the local catch has deteriorated, due perhaps to the fact that the pearling beds have been overworked. The depression in this main industry is reflected in the general trade of the island and more particularly in the ancillary trades, such as ship building and sail making. The former demand for engines for installation in launches and dhows has practically ceased. The Bahrain Petroleum Company, Limited. —The loss of pros- gu perity occasioned by the decline in the pearl industry has to some extent been alleviated by the employment which has been given cr&lt; at high wages to a large number of the inhabitants by the Bahrain ar) Petroleum Company, Limited. This Company, which is a sub- c p sidiary company of the Standard Oil Company, Limited, of Cali- m fornia, made its first shipment consisting of some 25,000 barrels gu of crude oil in June, 1934. ov Japanese competition in Bahrain. —Since January, 1934, four ^ Japanese steamers have arrived in Bahrain and landed cargoes of ) &lt; rice and cement. The latter is cheaper than British cement but 18 inferior in quality. A cheap brand of Italian cement has Tl also been recently introduced. Provided the cost of British cement M is not too far in excess of that of its rivals, it should be able to retain its hold on this market. P c Japanese piece goods, mostly brought from Bombay and Karachi ca by British steamers, have almost completely ousted piecegoods from a India. as Pearl Industry. —The main industry in Bahrain and the one upon which the majority of the inhabitants are directly or indirectly ch; BrGreat Britain and India. The superior quality of British goods is generally recognised but the Japanese article commands a more ready sale on account of its lower price. There is still a certain sale for British Shirtings and Mulls but they are losing ground owing to the cheaper prices of the Japanese equivalents. Silk goods are almost exclusively Japanese and are remarkable as much for their attractive and varied patterns as for their astonish ing cheapness. Other lines in which Japanese goods predominate on account of their cheapness are chinaware, glassware, hosiery, haberdashery, toys and rubber shoes. Japanese bicycles have been placed on the market, but pur chasers seem to have realised that they quickly wear out and British cycles are preferred on account of their durability. Japan and Sweden at present share the market for matches. Trade prospects. —In considering trade prospects it must be re membered that Bahrain itself is a limited market and derives much of its importance from its entrepot trade with the mainland. In addition to the rice and cotton goods already mentioned, large quantities of tea, sugar and coffee are annually transhipped and any cessation of this traffic would mean a serious loss to the trade of the island. Tea .—India enjoys an almost complete monopoly of the tea market though a small quantity of Java tea has recently made its appearance. Sugar .—Considerable quantities of English beet sugar have been imported into Bahrain in recent years and have competed in price and popularity with Java cane sugar and Soviet Union beet sugar. The latter has now disappeared from the market but two new com petitors, namely a crystal sugar from Holland and Austrian beet sugar said to be made in Hungary, have appeared in its stead. Latterly the supply of English sugar has dwindled and the de crease in demand has been attributed to (a) unsatisfactory bagging and (b) deterioration of the sugar owing to the dampness of the climate. If British exporters wish to compete in this promising market they must study these two points and also press their sugar on local merchants who are ready to recognise its superiority over other sugars in the matter of cleanliness. Coffee .—'The most popular coffee on this market is known as Yemani coffee and is brought from Aden by Strick steamers. It is reported that this coffee is actually grown in British Somaliland. The wholesale price of a bag of 168 lbs. is from 42 to 48 rupees. Malabar coffee is dearer and less popular on that account. Motors .—The market for motors appears to have reached a tem porary point of saturation owing to the large number of American cars which have recently been imported. There might, however, be a limited sale in the future for a British car provided it were suitable for the country and would compete with other cars in price.22 VI.—KUWAIT. General. —The State of Kuwait is ruled by an Arab Sheikh in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, who are represented by a Political Agent. The State is bounded to the north and north-west by ‘Iraq, to the south and south-west by Saudi Arabia and to the east by the head waters of the Persian Gulf. It has a population of approximately 70,000, about 60,000 of which live in the town of Kuwait itselfi whilst the remainder are Arab nomads. ' The state produces little to meet its own needs and relies for most of its requirements on foreign countries. What little agriculture there is, is centred at Jehrah (some 25 miles to the south-west of Kuwait town) where dates, melons, barley, wheat, beans and some other vegetables are grown in increasing quantities and transported to the capital by motor. Communications, Transport, etc. —In addition to sea and air communications, Kuwait is linked to Basra by road, and motors perform the journey in from 3 to 4 hours. Owing to the desert-like nature of the hinterland with its almost complete lack of supplies, no regular roads connect Kuwait with the interior and with Saudi © Arabia, and such merchandise as passes between the two states is transported by camel. Kuwait possess one of the best harbours in the Gulf and steamers can lie at a distance of a little over a mile from the shore. An important part of the trade between Kuwait and the other ports in the Persian Gulf is carried on by dhows. Customs. —The administration of the Kuwait customs is in the hands of a local Arab. An import duty of per cent, is levied on all goods arriving by sea and a land export duty of 2 per cent, is charged on goods taken out by Beduin. There is no sea export duty except on goods brought in from the interior such as clarified butter, hides, wool, etc., on which 4 per cent, is charged if exported. Currency. —The Indian rupee is the standard currency, but Maria Theresa dollars are used for dealings with the desert . The average value of 100 Maria Theresa dollars for the year ending 31st March, 1934, was 88 rupees. There are no banks in Kuwait and transfers of money to foreign countries are made either by means of international money order through the Post Office or through Banks in Basra. Trade. —The total volume of trade for the year ending 31st March, 1934, amounted to Rupees 5,300,611 (imports Rupees 3,882,866, exports Rupees 1,417,745), as compared with Rupees 4,226,570 (imports Rupees 3,114,689, exports Rupees 1,111,881) in the previous year.24 Singapore coffee and Mombasa coffee shared the market. Malabar coffee, which was formerly in great demand, is no longer so on account of its higher price. The cheapest brands of granulated sugar were from Egypt and Java. English crystal sugar and Dutch crystal sugar sold at higher prices. Japanese cement appeared to be making progress against Indian (Kathiawar) cement. Japanese piece goods filled the bazaar to the almost entire exclu sion of all others. Some all wool cloths made in England were on sale but they had to compete with Japanese woollen-cloths. Japanese silks and artificial silks of all descriptions were extremely popular on account of their cheapness. As in Bahrain, Japanese bicycles by reason of their poor quality have not been a success and British machines were generally pre ferred. Japanese matches also, in spite of their lower price, have not been as popular as Swedish matches. These two instances are perhaps an indication of some appreciation of the real worth of an article and suggest that, given increased purchasing power, there would be a demand for better class articles. Exports. —Exports consisted for the most part of pearls to India and specie, hides and skins to ‘Iraq. The value of the pearls ex ported in 1933-34 was estimated at 515,500 rupees as compared with 450,000 rupees in the previous year. VII.—MUSCAT. General. —The Sultan of Muscat and Oman is in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. The seaboard of his Sultanate extends, with the exception of a small strip on the east side of the promontory separating the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, from Tibat on the west side of this promontory to Ras Dharbat Ali, a point on the southern coast of Arabia some 290 miles north of the island of Socotra. Apart from two fertile stretches, the first comprising some 190 miles to the north-west of the town of Muscat and known as the Batinah, and the second the province of Dhofar in the extreme south, the coastal region is rocky and barren. In the interior the country is for the most part mountainous and uncultivated. The higher inland ranges are wooded in places and generally fertile. Dates are grown extensively in the Batinah, and limes, mangos and pomegranates flourish there as well as in the Oman hinterland. The port of Gwadur on the Makran coast with a portion of the surrounding territory also belongs to the Sultan of Muscat and has become important in recent years as a stopping place for Imperial Airways.25 The capital of the Sultanate is Muscat but the adjoining town of Matrah is the chief trading centre and the starting point of the caravan routes into the interior. The populations of the two towns are estimated at 4,500 and 8,500 respectively. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented by a Political Agent who i&amp; also His Majesty’s Consul. ^ Customs. —Customs dues are at present levied on imports at the ad ^ valorem rate of 5 per cent., save in the case of liquors, cigarettes and manufactured tobacco, carpets, silks and artificial silks, musical in struments and accessories, perfumery, toys, vegetable ghee, opium and drugs, on which the rate is 10 per cent. They provide the main source of revenue. No export duty is levied but a charge of 5 per cent, is imposed in Muscat and at all coastal town on dates and other commodities from the interior. Currency. —The Maria Theresa silver dollar is the standard currency and is the only one used for dealings with the interior. British sovereigns and Indian rupees and rupee notes are accepted in the towns. There are no banks and business is carried on amongst the native merchants by issuing drafts on India. During 1933-34, the value of 100 Maria Theresa dollars fluctuated from 85 llupees to 96 Rupees, the average bazaar rate being 90 Rupees 8 annas. Transport. —Sailing vessel is the chief means of transport along the coast and in 1933-34 out of a total value of imports amounting to Rupees 3,008,222, goods to the value of Rupees 1,098,300 were * imported in sailing craft and to the value of Rupees 1,909,922 in steamers. The value of goods exported by these two forms of trans port amounted to Rupees 387,420 and Rupees 1,493,890 respectively. Imports and Exports. —The following table shows the value in Rupees of imports and exports for the last three years :— The decline in the value of imports is largely due to the quan tities of cheap Japanese goods which have been unloaded on the market. The progress made by Japanese cotton piece-goods is shown by a comparison of the import figures for 1932-1933 with those for 1933-1934. In the former year the value of cotton goods im ported from India amounted to Rupees 172,966, from the United Kingdom to Rupees 43,765, from Persia to Rupees 7,706 and from Imports Exports 1931-32. 3,737,118 1,707,327 1932-33. 3,471,618 2,027,334 1933-34. 3,008,222 1,881,310 Total ... 5,444,445 5,498,952 4,889,53226 (27442 - 52) Wt 2781—737 1500 3/35 P. St. G.379/6 other countries (including Japan) to Kupees 359,049. In 1933-34 imports from Japan amounted to Rupees 362,579, from India to Rupees 117,674, from the United Kingdom to Rupees 28,190 and from other countries to Rupees 21,260. Ihe chief imports in addition to cotton goods are rice, which is impoited in large quantities both by steamer and sailing vessel from India, coffee and sugar. The most important exports are dried fish and dates. The figuies for 1932-1933, which are the latest detailed figures avail able, show that the total value of dried sardines exported in that year by steamer amounted to Rupees 316,875 of which 227,050 Rupees’ worth went to Germany and of dried fish other than sardine to Rupees 216,360, of which 206,485 Rupees’ worth went to Ceylon. The value of date exports, which were almost exclusivelv to India, amounted to Rupees 761,300.ADVERTISEMENT THE BOARD OF TRADE JOURNAL &lt;J To minimise economic friction by making readily available to all the latest trade news collected from every corner of the earth is the principal object of the Board of Trade in publishing an official Journal. A liberal interpretation of what constitutes “ trade news ” makes the articles contained in the Journal as varied and informative as they are up-to-date and accurate. SHIPPING TRANSPORT TEXTILES RAILWAYS ENGINEERING MINING are some of the many subjects on which articles regularly appear. (| The Board ok Trade Journal is unique in the field of periodical trade literature. It is edited from a Department of State and the whole resources of that Department are drawn upon in its production. From Overseas, the world-wide organisation of the British Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Service regularly supplies these two Departments with full particulars of all the events having a bearing on commercial opportunities and on the trend of trade. (J The Board of Trade Journal is therefore able to print early news of OPENINGS FOR TRADE FAIRS TRADE EXHIBITIONS COMMERCIAL TREATIES TARIFFS CUSTOMS REGULATIONS and on these subjects it is usually the first source, certainly the most authoritative source and frequently the only source of information. The constantly changing tariff and trade regulations in all parts of the world are immediately reported in the Journal and this service very greatly increases the value of the Journal to all engaged in trade to-day. cj Because it provides these exclusive services the Journal is read and filed for reference by all the leading import and export houses, banks, insurance offices, shipping offices, manufacturing firms and commercial offices throughout the world.

BRITISH CONSULATE-GENERAL, BUSHIRE. November 12th, 1934. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a Report on Economic and Trade Conditions in the Persian Gulf compiled by Mr. Vice-Consul Gamble on the conclusion of a tour carried out in accordance with the arrangements arrived in correspondence ending with D.O.T. 25575/1934 O.T.No.12 of 7th July, 1934. Mr. Gamble f s tour was preceded by one made by Mr. Baillie, whose interim report, preparatory to Mr. Gamble's, was forwarded to you under my despatch No.C/149 of 30th March, 1934. 2. Mr. Gamble's report, the first to give a connected commercial and economical picture of the whole of the Persian Gulf, contains much useful information and reflects credit on that officer. I suggest that it should be printed for publication with the possible omission of the reference in Section Jl (Shipping) to the consignment of Arms and ammunition for the Persian Government, and omission of the whole note on Smuggling in the same Section. 3. As the Vice-Consul's tours will be undertaken every year and Reports prepared every other year, I venture to suggest that in the interests of economy, the annual Commercial Reports prepared by the Political Agents, Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, which are incorporated in the Economic and Trade Reports, need no longer be printed. In those years when the Economic and Trade Report is not produced, the Political Agents will prepare their Reports for submission to me, and it is by the aid of these Reports, together with his annual tours that the Vice-Consul will continue to keep in touch with commer cial developments in the Gulf. 4./4. I am sending a copy of this letter together with a copy of the Report to His Majesty ! s Minister at Tehran and to the Government of India.

RZ_ I o ■ 3 2 POLITICAL Department. DrfAFI LCTTj^H 18 FEb 1955 My dear Baggallay, Ivany UianiCo for your letter of H.L. Baggallay, Bsq., Foreign Oflice. 2. the 12th February, S 40/40/65. 2. I do not know that we feel very strongly on the question of dividing the proposed Report on Economic and Trade Conditions in the Persian Gulf into two separate sections, one to deal with Persia and one to deal with the Arab States. From the commercial, as from other points of view, the Gulf _ A D.O.T. Report on Economic and Trade Conditions in the Persian Gulf will shortly be published, with various amendments suggested by the interested depts. Mr* Baggallay has raised the question whether it would not be better to split it into two portions - one dealing solely with the Persian and the other solely with the Arab side of the Gulf, so as to avoid emphasising the fact that the Residency remains at Bushire and that the Arab side is administered, so far as we are concerned, from Persian soil. is really to be looked at as a whole and our general disposition, unless you think that there is any risk of reviving the Persian interest in the removal of the Bushire Residency, would on the whole be to leave matters as they are, more particularly as the Persian section if printed separately will probably be very small. But I uo not think we feel very strongly and if you would prefer to split the Report on the lines suggested in your draft we should have no I rather doubt whether there is a very conclusive case for action on these lines, but suggest that I might reply to tne F.O. as in tne draft. objection here. J. G. LMTHWAlTE.INDEXED ,FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 12th February, 1935 (E 40/40/65) IMMEDIATE. My dear Laitnwaite, The Department of Overseas Trade are very anxious to proceed as soon as possible with the publication, in some form or another, of the 'Report on Economic and Trade Conditions in the Persian Gulf', which formed the subject of your letter P.Z. 7879/34 of the 1st January. 2. You may remember that I asked you a little while back whether you thought it would be preferable to avoid the publication in a single report of matters affecting both Persia and the Arab States. I now enclose a draft reply to the Department of Overseas Trade putting this idea into concrete form. 3. I have not so far discussed this idea with any higher authority here, as I do not want to give the Department/ J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.EDepartment of Overseas Trade all the trouble that it will involve unless you agree that the matter is one tnat is really worth raising.E 4G/40/65. 7 r 1 1038 Q 3 O (T^j Draft. The Foreign Office have considered Department of the Department of Overseas Trade's memorandum Overseas Trade, No. m 25575/1934 of the 24th December, 1934, regarding the publication of iir, Vice-Consul Qanble's report of the 12th November, 1934, on Economic and Trade Conditions in the ,ersian Gulf, 2, Subject to the omissions which the Department of Overseas 'Trade themselves jropose and to the amendments suggested by the India 'h/7 Office in their letter jof 1,2,7879/34 of the 1st January, 1934, of which a copy has been sent to the Department, the Foreign Office see no objection to the publication of the material contained in this report, £ith regard to tno amendment suggested by the India office in line 22 of page 32, the Foreign Office see no strong objection to a reference to the stoppage of trade/trade with Jaudi Arabia owing to the 3audi blockade* Aa the paragraph in qa eat ion is at present worded, however, they would prefer to omit the last sentence, substituting for it the sentence proposed by the India Office, and to leave intact the sentence beginning 'The 'depression has been due *••••••' 3* The Foreign Office would prefer, however, that this material should not all appear in a single publication* Some of it relates to certain arab States in which His Majesty's Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; some of it to that part of the Persian Axaplre included in the district of His Majesty's Consul-General at ^ushire and adjoining consular districts* The fact that the appointments of Political Resident and Consul-General are oombined in a single officer, and that the Political Resident resides on Persian territory, is a source of recurrent/recurrent dissatisfaction to tho Persian Government. For this reason and for other reasons connected with the refusal of the Persian Government to recognise the Arab states t or their special relations with His Majesty^ Government, the Foreign Office consider that notwithstanding the precedent afforded by the publication of Lieutenant Commander Forester’s report of April, 1929, it will be undesirable to include in a commercial report upon the Arab States of the Persian Gulf commercial information regarding any part of the Persian Empire, more especially if these reports are clearly shown to have be.'S written by a single official. 4, The Foreign Office therefore suggest that in the 'Report on Lioonomic and ‘Trade 'Conditions in the Persian Gulf': (a) the report should be stated to be by 'Mr. F.H. Gamble, in charge of commercial 'affairs/’affairs at the Political Residency for 'the Persian Gulf w t without Bushire being mentioned* (b) the first paragraph of the 'General 'ReYiew of Trade' in Part II, should have an extra sentence, reading: 'In addition 'money was scarce for various reasons, of 'which the most Important was the continued 'depression in the pearl trade' and the second paragraph be omitted altogether* (a) the whole of the third paragraph of the 'General Review' with the exception of the opening sentence, should be omitted* (d) the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the 'General Review' beginning 'The United 'Kingdom and India' and 'British motor- 'cars' which apparently ap*ly to Persia, should be omitted* (e) the final paragraph of the section on shipping in 3 art II beginning 'In spite'of foreign competition', should he omitted, together with the statistics of shipping at Bushlre. Cf) Sections III, IV and V should he omitted altogether* The remaining references to Persia in Parts I and II are relatively unimportant* 5* It would he possible to issue arts III, IV and V separately as a 'Report on 'Koonomio and trade conditions in certain parts 'of South Persia, by Ur* P*H. Gamble, His 'Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Buahire*' Part I, the parts of the 'General Review of Trade' which were omitted from the report on the 'Persian Gulf' and the section on shipping could appear in this report also* The section on 'Suggestions for the improvement of British 'trade' appears to apply mainly to the Arab side, but could perhaps be included with the omission of the specific references to the Arab aide*6. If it will be ineonYenient at this stage to make the extensive alterations suggested in the 'General Review' in Tart II t the Foreign Office do not wish to press for these alterations to be made* They think, however, that the final paragraph of the section on shipping, with its appendix, and Sections III, IV and V should in any case be omitted*/ Mr. Laithofait e / n^ait @) (tej) 'M»' Attached is a draft letter to the Foreign Office regarding the report of trade conditions in the Persian Gulf. I have endeavoured to incorporate in the draft the maximum number of amendments which we wish to maxe* There are some of them which you may not think it worth while to ask the Foreign Office to adopt. The report as a whole forms an indictment of Persian restrictions on trade. Specific references to this subject are, however, quite mildly worded, and it is doubtful whether the Persian Government could substantiate any objection to their inclusion in a document published officially by H.M.G. It might indeed be a good thing for them to see this indictment ol their policy and in any case we might leave the Foreigi Office themselves to take this objection to publication.

This amendment is consequential on the/the one suggested on page 14. Pages 20-23 . It will be observed that in paragraph 3 of his letter of 29th October Mr. Gamble states that the statistics for 1933-34 for the port of Bunder Abbas were obtained confidentially.

E« Subject to certain omissions indicated in pencil in the enclosed copy of the report, the department of j^nolo sores UTerseas Trade propose to print this report and issue it in the ordinary published series of economic reports. before doin 0 so, they ’.ould appreciate the cQuuaenta ol the iorei&lt;^i Office upon the following points. 3. on pages £4,31 and 35 there are references to the political status of Bahrain, Kuwait and muscat. It will be observed that in tne case of Bahrain it is stated that, ,? the state is ruled by an ;jrab Cheij^h. his majesty 1 $ Government ana the Government of India are represented by a ioiitical Agent”. 4.

It is thought desirable to ensure complete accuracy in the descriptions of the representation of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in these territories and the Department of Overseas Trade would therefore welcome such comments or modifications as the foreign Office consider necessary. \ 7 # on page 32 of the report, the phrase »’pre-blockade days” occurs in the penultimate line of the fourth paragraph.

Weights and Measures.- On the Arab aide of the Gulf English weights and. measures are generally used for trade with foreign countries. In Persia the unit of weight is the man which varies from place to place but What is known as the Tabrls man in the meet generally used. One Tabrls man is equal to 6.5466 lbe. 9 and one kharvsr ( 100 Tabrls man ) le equal to approximately six hundred weight.

In Kuwait # tha Captain of &amp; Japanese steamer created a very good impression hy his pleasant manner and by landing the merohants a large tarpaulin to cover up their goods which were in danger of being damaged by bad weather* furthermore, Japanese traders were willing to import goods on their own account and dispose of them afterwards to merohants as and when opportunity offered. The progress In ths sale of Japanese goods will be examined in more detail in the sections dealing with the various marksts, but, in general, it may be said that her pleee goods, ohinaware, glassware and haberflashsry predominated throughout the Gulf; that her cement competed with cements from the United Kingdom, Italy, Yugoslavia and the Baltic States, but was not always successful on account of its inferior qualityj that her matohea •hared the mar^st on the Arab aide with those of Sweden and ftussla and were cheaper than either; that considerable luantities of rloe brought by Japanese steamers from Japan, wore dumped In Bahrain and Kuwait and adversely effected the sales of Indian rloe in these markets. Ho less remarkable than the advance of Japanese trade was the decline of Russian trade due, In part, to the fact that Russian goods, like those of other nations, were to a large extent submerged by the deluge of Japanese goods which descended upon the markets on both sides of the Gulf from 193£ onwards, j and, in part, to the economic disputes which took place between Russia and Persia during the last two years. Following ths ratification of a oonwierolal treaty between the two countries in October 1931, Russian trading concerns were re-organixed and centralized, banks were established at Mohammerah and Bushire and, for a time, Russian goods, aided by the monopolies which had been granted to them for the import of sugar and matohss, continued to pour into the Persian ports.5 !) ' (3) S#o. II.oontd. t: •-&gt; ■ Towards the and of 1982, complaints wore made against Russian trading methods and the alleged excess of Russian imports orer exports, which calainated in the spring of 1982 in an almost complete cessation of trade between the two oo&gt;nntriss\nnd the boycott of Soviet institutions in fersiaTj Although some measures of agreement has slnoe been arrived at, up to the time of writing (October 1984) no real reeumptlon of trade in the Sulf was apparent* The United 'ingdo® and India both loet ground heavily in the pleee goods market, but the former was able to hold its own in the sale of maohlnery, where some appreciation of quality as opposed to considerations merely of original cost was still in evidence* The high quality of British oement was also apprecia ted, but competition in this market was extremely keen and orders were well divided amongst a number of nations* British motor ears have not so far been able to oompete successfully with the well established American makes such as Chsvrolet, Ford, Dedgt and Buick. This is to be regretted in view of the large number of ears which are Imported annually through Pasrs and the Persian ports. If however, Britishb manufacturers wish to dbtain a share of this market,they must introduce oars which will compare favourably in price with Amerdbaa oars of the same hoarse power and at th^ same time be able to withstand the rough handling and rough roads to which they are normally subjected* It would therefore be essential before attempting anything in this direction to oarry out a careful study of local conditions and to pay attention to the questions of (a) accessories and (b) credit. The faot that spare parte for the better known American oars in this area are readily available and that some manufacturrers oblige their agents to carry certain minimum stooks is a great point in their favour with the local purchaser* American oanufacturars are often prepared to give their agents long terms of credit which are passed on to the customer and this is further / cause(4) Sec. II. oontd cause of popularity. Imports of British sugar, which appeared to be making considerable progress two years ago both through Basra into ’Irag as well as through the ports on the Arab side of the Oulf, showed a disappointing decline. In 'Ira^, the amount fell from 9,167 tone or 24.2$ of the total in 1932-36 to 6,404 tons or 16.3$ of the total in 1933-34. Meanwhile the Imports of Belgian and T ^utch sugar increased and Egyptian sugar also became popular. The reasons for the set back to British sugar In Bahrain and Kuwait will be examined In the eectione dealing with these Sheikhdoms. In Persia, the decision to allow Russia only a portion of the sugar quota Instead of the whole, as previously, resulted in large quantities being imported from Belgium, Holland and Java, but the varying restriotions greatly handicapped merchants in ordering from abroad.Up to the present no Brititfi sugar has appeared in the South of Persia, but It is possible that there would be an opening in this market in the event of further relaxation of the existing regulations• India retained an almost complete monopoly of the Import of tea on the Arab side, though some Java tea appeared in Bahrain and was Imported in large quantities through Basra into ’Iraq. In Persia supplies came mostly from Calcutta, Colombo and Batavia.1 f f u {«) S«C. II. oontd. . .. /r*' ic/ r f SHimBO .-*''''^ 1 *— 11 —w—&gt; The Chief features of shipping in the Suif during the last two years have been the withdrawal of Russian steamers and the steady progress made by the German Kansa line. The cessation of Russian shipping since the summer of 1933 was due, in part, to the embargo which was placed for some time on Russian goods entering JPersia and, jin part, to the fact that Russia took little in the wsy of exports from either ’Iraq or Persia and consequently her ships were without cargo on the homeward journey. The withdrawal of Russian steamers did not, however, prevent Russian goods consisting mostly of matches, glass and porcelain ware from arriving either in chartered Greek steamers running between the Black 3ea and Basra or in Strlek boats afte; transhipment at Port Said, Hansa stea era obtained good cargos both on the Inward and outward voyage*. They brought principally leaf sugar,glassware, steel sheets and iron bars from Antwerp and general merchandise from Hamburg and took away grain and dates from Basra and dates, dried fruits, ootton and fum from the Persian ports. pPhey also brought consignments of ammunition and military material for the Persian Government to Bandar Shahpur and Mohaaner ah Formerly machinery and material from the United States of America for the Bahrain Petroleum Go.,Ltd., were transhipped at Hamburg and brought to Bahrain by Hansa steamers but latterly such consignments have been transhipped at a United Kingdom port and brought by St rick steamers, [jn Basra it was reported that the Hansa steamers had received some set back owing to Jewish merchants in Baghdad stipulating that the** goods were not to be shipped in German steams re. ^ Towards the end of 1933 Japanese steamers made their first appearance and elnoe then some six or seven steamers have made tripe to the Gulf. Their principal cargos were cement for Basra and Mohammer&amp;h, cement and rice for Kuwait, Bahrain and( 6 ) _ Sec. II. oontd. Mu teat, end piece goods, cement and glassware for Mobaanerah. Complaints hare been made against Japanese traders both in Persia and 'Iraq that they import without exporting and the absence of cargo for the return journey may cause their shipping to fail as Russian shipping has failed. Latterly, however, Japanese steamers have been talcing large quantities of raw ootton from Mohammerah and, if this continues, it is possible that the difficulty will be overcome. Swedish steamers brought cement and railway material to Bandar Shahpur and cement to Basra, where it was reported that the Swedish Last Asiatic Co.,Ltd., of Gothenburg proposed to send out a steamer to the Gulf onoe every month. The Italian Lloyd frleetlno Company started a two monthly service to the Calf ports early in 1934 to be carried out by the motor vessel 'Xsirla”. Cargos consisted mostly of Yugo slav cement and Austrian sugar. In spite of foreign competition* British shipping appeared to be holding its own and it will be noticed from the table of shipping for Bushlre whioh is annexed that British ships carried over 50&amp; of the total number of packages Imported into and approximately 85$ of the total number of paekagee exported from that port in the year 1933-54. * r , / * Hot euitablo for pat 11 oat Ion without modification.( 8 ) Il.oontd. iaportant parlr. cn toy native saillug vesaelfiM 8atl»»Ja large number of wkioii are in eag&amp;gad In sraussling *cod» from ttw -arato OoaatZ to ^• r,la * It l® tai&gt;&gt;oijOtuip to esttiBBte tap quantLtiaa uf tuue SMUtiiled, it is reasonably certain to 3 up»&gt; 06 &gt;e, ±or axaavie, that a oit prcyortloa ol tfta ouiarwiaa unuocount- aoiy larB® auvvlies of JUtjar aaioa ar® iandad by aoraan steaaers at Dibai and anarjah found their »ay aorosa the Oulf into the a^.il porta along th« ooaat of '«reia. The lar«;o quantitiea of gold orn&amp;aenta, ehioh eere reported to have entered Bahrain la payment for smuggled gooda, is another indication of tne extent of tnl* traffic. Latterly the Persian authorities have been making strenuous efforts to suppress smuggling activities, fhler gunboats have been patrolling tho ooast and seising suspect dhows; inspectors huve been cent from Tehran to search houses and confiscate contraband goods; a system of banda- rcling tea and sugar has been adopted as a means of oheok- ing the sal* of Illicit supplies.

Considerable quantities of smuggled goods also pass from 'Iraq into Persia either by small boats along t i cc t or across the shatt-ai-Arab or further northwards aeresa the land border between the two countries. * nctsultaole for publication without modlfioatlon.mm IHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHI (9) Seo.

How that Imperial Airways run a regular service calling at Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat, it should be possible for British manufaoturwrs to send representatives to visit these places and get in touch with reliable and energetic agents who would be willing to undertake the marketing and sale of their goods. (3) The need for advertisement and propaganda is as essential in the Gulf as elsewhere. Many merchants are badly informed about goods of foreign manufacture and if well supplied with illustrated pamphlets will frequently be induced to place an order. trappers and packing should be attractive and even das sling and, where the goods are intended for sale on the Arab side of the Gulf, the inscriptions should as far as possible be in Arable. (4) Goods manufactured in the United Kingdom should be olearly , marked as such. There have been instances of foreign goods being made to resemble so nearly British goods that it has been difficult to distinguish between them and ae the latter are generally respected for their quality, it is important that there should be no room for confusion.uener*!.- au#hir«, wnioa •atirely on U» entroyot trad., ft** ^ t*i«rtanoQ tn roonnl y«ax» owing to tlxo Inoreaslng tendenoy for trade to mcve towards goUammeraU, Bandar .&gt;UatU)ur and Oiwaa In reasons* to the greater faotlltles offered *y these ports for landing and transporting oargo to Vie Interior.

Apart from the activities of the Anglo version Oil ?o»t which lit outside the scope of this report, there are no important industries in the district. Thors is sn occasional demand for machinery suoh as slsotrio light engines, motor feoat engines, oranes, water pumps, etc., and in this line British goods are generally preferred on account of their superior quality, hut it must he remembered that foreign machinery is also available and that prioe is as often as not the factor ahioh determines the placing of an order. In Mohammerah itself there has been talk of establishing flour mills, also of importing machinezy for soap making and the weaving of woillon goods. Imports.- Plsos goods are imported in large quantities from Japan, sometimes in exohangs for raw ootton, and in lesser quantities from India and the United irirdom. Tea, comes from dolombo, Calcutta and Batavia; motor oars, trucks and accessories almost sxolusivsly from the united States* vugar is imported from Antwerp, Marseilles, Port-Maid and Hamburg.

The latest figures show that the deollne is continuing and this must be attributed to the difficult economic conditions prevailing in the country and also to the tendency, which has been mentioned elsewhere, for tr&amp;de to move towards hohaamerah.

Of the smaller islands, MUharraq, situated at a short distance from the north east comer of the main Island, Is the most important and has an arsa of square miles. Cultivation.- Owing to lack of water and the rooky nature of the eoll, only a small proportion of the islands, approxl- i -mately one twentieth of the total area, is under cultivation and this Is confined for the most part to th* northern end of the main island, where in resent years numerous artesian wells have been introduced. The stats is ruled by sa Arab Sheikh. His Majesty's The total population of the islands is estimated at 120,000. Transport.- Roads capable of taking motor traffic exist over the northern part of the Island; the only on# which may be termed first olass connsots Manama with the oil-field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, situated at a distance of some 16 miles from the town. Recent figures show that there were 102 oars and 27 lorries on the island. Taxis can be hired by visitors. Motor dhows and launches as well as sailing dhows oonneet the Islands with each other and also with the mainland ports of Qntlf and Ojair. Landing facilities, etc.,- Owing to shallow anchorage, steamers arriving at Bahrain are obliged to lie some three or four miles from the shore an^ discharge their cargo Into dhows. A very oonelderable proportion of this cargo is subsequently transhipped to principal town of the state, has an arsa of 203 square miles Government and Government of India are represented by a Political Agent.revenue of the state is saalaly derived, are levied at the rate of 5# ad valorem on ifneral merchandise, 10^ on certain 'luzuxy f articles such as carpets, cycles, olocJcs and watches, electrical ^oods, furniture, gramophones, gold thread, hosiery, henna, motor oars, perfumery, toilet soap, silk goods, sewing machines, tyres and tubes, type-writers, boots and shoes, playing cards, and 16$ on alcohol,tobacco and cigarettes. Transit dues at the rate of are charged on goods landed at Bahrain for the mainland. An export duty of 10 Rupees per bundle of hides and 2 Rupees per basket of dates is charged. The customs office is controlled by a European Director of Customs. Currency, Banking, ete.The Indian rupee forms the basis of all eommereial transactions. The average rate of exchange during 1922-34 was Rupees 1340 per one hundred pounds sterling. There is a branch of the ^astern Bank Limited in Manama, which transacts all classes of business, a branch office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited, who also aot^ as agents for Imperial Airways, a Post Office and a Wireless station. Trade.- The total value of trade during the year ended the 31st.March 1934 amounted to Rupees 16,029,840 and showed a slight increase over the figure for the previous year. Imports aotually decreased from RuDees 9,772,360 to Rupees 9,276,040 but exports increased from Rupee* 6,094,210 to Rupees 6,764,800 making a total increase of Rupees 163,270. The following table shows the value in rupees of imports from the principal countries during the last three years(3) See.

It will b« notloed that although Indian imports vtlll predominate they show a big decline as compared with previous years; Japanese imports show a steady increase, whilst United Kingdom imports have decreased by over a third in the past year. Imports.- Rice, cotton goods and specie in the order mentioned are the chief items of import. India continues to be the almost sole importers of rice, thwugh recently some 35,000 bags have been brought to Bahrain by Japanese steamers and sell in the bas&amp;ar as Japanese rice. This rice, However, is reported to have originally been bought from India by Japan in view of a threatened famine and subsequently re-exported when there was found to be an unexpected surplus. In September 1934, it was selling at 9 Rupees 4 annas for a bag of £18 lbs. and was cheaper than Calcutta rice which cost the same amount for a bag of 162 lbs. India, Japan and the United Kingdom ^ shared the import of cotton goods, but the value of United Kingdom Imports fell from Rupees 442,500 in 193£-3£ to Icupees 208,460 in 1933-34. The corresponding figures for Japanese imports were Rupees 558,410 and Rupees 436,340 and for Japanese Indian importe Rupees 694,070 and Rupees 640,590. Sp.ol. mg mostly Imported from India and ’Iraq.&lt;4) Sea. VI. aontd. Exports*- ?ha principal axporta in order of importance in 19&amp;2-44 were gol&amp; t rice, cotton goode # pearls and specie and the principal countries to which exported, Arabia and India* The large amount of gold exported to India and England - Rupees 839,920 and Rupees 476,360 respeotlrely - consisted mostly of bars obtained from melting down ornaments* A consi derable quantity of this gold is believed to have oome from Persia j^Ln payment for smuggled goodsj In recent months the flow of gold has greatly diminished* exports of rioe and ootton goods oonslsted mainly of transhipments to Arabia, whilst pearls and specie were exported almost exclusively to India* During the laet few years small quantities of shells have been exported to Germany and England* Sates are grown on the island and on the mainland, but the mxpply is not large enough or regular enough to make export on a large scale possible. The Pearl Xndnstzy.- The main industry in Bahrain and the one upon which the majority of the inhabitants are directly or indirectly dependent for a livelihood is pearl fishing* For a number of reasons this industry has fallen into a state of extreme depression toxring recent years and no signs of improve ment are as yet visible* In the first place, economic conditions in Europe and America have led to a decrease^ in the demand for pearls with the result that continental buyers no longer find it worth their while to visit Bahrain every season as they did in former years. Secondly, the introduotion of Japanese cultured pearls has had an adverse effect on the market for natural pearls, and, thirdly, the quality of the local oatoh has deteriorated, due perhaps to the fact that the pearling beds have been overworked. The depression in this main industry is reflected in the general trade of the island and more particularity In the anoillary trades, such as ship building and sail Miking* The former demand for |^ lYllQ dad Thorny-ermf£Jengines for Installation in launches and dhows has practically ceased. d 3■ j ■* i - . ( 6 ) 3*0• 71* contd. In th# past year the Kilvin agent sold only two engines as compared with ten or twelve In previous years. The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited.- The loss of prosperity ocoaslon^hy the decline in the pearl industry has to sorae extent been alleviated by the employment which has fceen given t&amp; high wages to a large number of the inhabitants Uu&gt; by,,Bahrain Petroleum Company limited. This Company, which is a subsidiary company of the standard Oil Company Limited of California, made its first shipment consisting of some 2b,000 barrels of crude oil e£i in June 1934. Japanese competition in Bahrain.- Sinoe January 1934 four Japanese steamers have arrived in Bahrain and landed cargoes of rice and cement. The latter is cheaper than British cement but inferior in quality. British Hand Brand Portland cement sells at 2 Rupees 2 annas per cwt., as against one Rupee 6 annas for Japanese cement. A cheap brand of artificial Italian cement has also been recently introduced. Provided the cost of British oement is not too far in excess of that of Its rivals, it should be able to retain its hold on this market. Japanese piece goods, mostly brought from Bombay and Karachi by British Steam navigation loapany fat earners, have almost completely ousted piece goods from Great Britain and India. The superior quality of British goods is generally recognised but the Japanese article ooamands a more ready sale on account of Its lower price. A roll of Manchaater cotton, tor example, 60 yards long and 21 inches wide, sells at 6 rupees whereas a roll of Jeienese cotton 40 yards long by 26 inohes wide costs 4 rupees 4 annas. There is still a certain sale for British. Shirtings and Stalls but they are losing ground owing to tha cheaper prices of the Japanese equivalents. Silk goods are almost exclusively Japanese and are remark able as much for their attractive and varied patterns as for their astonishing cheapness. A piece of brocaded voile eosts only 6 rupees 4 annas for a roll 20 yards long and 26 Inohes*7 . t ( 6 ) S«o. TX.oontd. 1 vldl«. Other lines In which Japanese goods predominate on aocount of their oheapness are ehlnaware, glassware, hosiery, haber dashery, toys and rubber shoes. As a further example of the dlfferenoe In pride of Japanese and British articles It may be ■entloned that Japanese gramophones were selling at 80 Hupees each, whereas a British gramophone cost fro* 80 to 85 ftapees* Japanese bicycles hare been plaoed on the market at 80 Rupees each but purchasers see* to hare realised that they gulokly wear out and British oyeles, though owor double the price, are preferred on aooount of their durability, Japan and Sweden at present share the market for matches, A full case of Japanese matches (100 gross) costs 55 ftupess ex customs, Swedish matches, whloh are superior In , are Imported In three quarter eases (75 gross) and cost 75 ftupees per case. Trade prospects.- In considering trade prospects It must / be reneabered that Bahrain Itself la a Halted market and derives much of Its Importance from Its entrepot trade with the mainland. In addition to the Hoe and ootton goods already mentioned, large quantities of tea, sugar and oof fas are annually transhipped and any cessation of this traffic would mean a serious loss to the trade of the Island, Tsa,- India enjoys an almost oomplets monopoly of ths tea market though a small quantity of Java tea has recently made Its sppearanos, Sugar,- Considerable quantities of English beet sugar ha vs been Imported Into Bahrain In reoent years and have competed In price and popularity with Java oane sugar and Russian beet sugar. The latter has now disappeared from the market but two new competitors, nsmsly a crystal sugar from Holland and Austrian best sugar said to be made In Hungary, have appeared la Its stead. The following table shows ths prloes of th# various brands(T) S«c . Vl.oontd, In 3«pt«ab«r 1934. Average weight of bag. wholesale price per bag. Retail pries per lb* Java Cane sugar* 2£8.I.b..

Si 10.6.0. 1b 0.0.10. latterly the supply of in^lleh s^ar has dwindled and the decrease in demand has Veen attributed to (a) unsatisfactory bagging and (b) deterioration of the sugar owing to the dampness of the climate* If British exporters wish to compete in this promision market they suet study these tv*&gt; points and also press their sugar on looal merchants who are ready to recognise its superiority over other sugars in the matter of cleanliness* Coffee.- The most popular coffee on this market is known i\ZuX as Yemeni coffee and is brough from Aden by ^dmiek steamers* It is reported that this coffee is actually grown in British Somaliland. The wholesale prioe of a bag of 168 lba* t is from 42 to 48 Rupees. Malabar tfoffee is dearer and less popular on that account * Motors.- The market for motors appears to have reached a temporary point of absorption owing to the large number of Ameroian ears, chiefly Chevrolet* and Fords, which have recently been imported. There might however be a limited sale in the future for a British oar provided it were suitable for the country and would compete with other oars kft prioe*TIJ. XVWA.XT th* Independent iOreb state of Kuwait Is bounded to the north and north west by 'Ira^, to the south and south w*st fcy ^andi Arabia and to th® ®a®t by th® h®ad«at®r8 of th® i®rslan Onlf • It ha® a population of approximately 70,000, about 60,000 of whioh lira in the town of Kuwait it®®lf, whilst th® remainder are Arab nomadse The stat® produces little to moot it® own no®d® and relio® for most of it® requirements on foreign countries, what little agriculture there i®, is eentred at Jahrah (some £5 mile® to the south west of Kuwait town) where dates, melon®, barley, wheat, beans and some other vegetable® are grown in increasing quantities and transported to the capital by motor. Communications, transport, etc.,- In addition to sea and air communications, Kuwait is linked to Basra by road and motors perform the Journey in from £ to 4 hours. Owing to the deserts like nature of the hinterland with it® almost complete lack of supplies no regular roads connect Kuwait with the Interior and with Saudd Arabia and such merchandise as passes between the two states is transported by camel. Kuwait possesses one of the best harbour® in the Oulf and steamers can lie at a distance of a little over a mile from the shore. An important part of the trade between Kuwait and the other port® in the Persian Culf is oarrled on by dhows. Customs.- The administration of the Kuwait customs is in the hands of a local Arab. An import duty of 4$$l is levied on all goods arriving by sea and a land export duty of is charged on goods taken out by BCduln, There is no sea export duty except on goods brought in from the interior such as clarified butter, hides, wool, etc., on which 4 per oent ie charged if exported. Currency.- The Indian rupee is the standard currency, but Marla fhswesa dollars are used for dealings with the desert.(» 9«ot. fll.eontd. *' V, th€ mr*r*g* v^lue of 100 &amp;arl* JJHorooa dollars for tho year ending 31st• a*rafc 1934 was 88 raposs. fhors are no banks in Kuwait and transfers of isoney to foreign countries are a&amp;de either by means of International ^oney Order through the Post Office or through Banks in Basra, Trade*- The total volume of trade for the year ending It** 31st*March 1934 amounted to Rupees 5,300,611 (imports Rupees 3,882,866, exports Rupees 1,417,745) as compared with Rupees 4,826,670 ( Imports Hupeet 3,114,689, exports Rupees 1,111,861 ) In the preflvus year. In spite of this Inoresse, trade showed little elgas of emerging from the depressed state Into whlsh It hue fallen during the last few years. The depression has keen duo tm partially to feme world oondltlons, partially to tha continued, stoppage of trade with audl Arabia and partially to the decline in the pearl Industry. Tormarly a flourishing trade existed with the north east of *r*bl* and Kuwait •erred *s an entrepot pert for fiorthem Hass in the same way as Bahrain now serves as an entrepot port for Southern Has a* Rice, sugar, coffee and piece goods were sent out from Kuwait and, in return, wool, hides and clarified butter were brought in by the tribesmen* As a result, however, ef the blockade maintained by the King of Saudi Urabia, the value of this trade which has been estimated at Rupees 15,000,000 per annua in pre-blockade days, has now shrunk little more than a tenth of that figure. The serious effects in Bahrain of the decline In the pearl industry have already been mentioned* They have been even more severely felt in Kuwait on account of the greater proportion of the inhabitants who do end on this industry for a livelihood* In former years, the Kuwait pearling fleet consisted of some seven hundred ships, but only three or four hundred have put to sea in recent years and the oonseifuent loss of employment greatly reduced the purchasing power of the inhabitants and compelledth%m to )mjr tho cheapest goods avallmtls* Hatsian goods, although not alwajs appreciably dsarsr than their Japanese equivalents, have been almost oompletely driven off the oarfcet by the latter and this faot nay be regarded as a tribute to the energy and aaleyaanahip of the Japanese goods agents. Apart fro® pearly fishing, the only noteworthy Industry in Tuwalt is boat building and sotae SO boats of an aggregate value of approximately 100,000 Rupees have been built during the last three years. An electric plant has rsoently been Installed in the town and should provide a good demand for eleotrie apparatus and accessories. The current supplied ia D.C. and the voltage ZZO. Imports.** The customs' statistics for 1932-24 shew that India, as in previous years, was the prlnoipal importing country with 29.3;* of the total import trade. This figure,however, is apt to be misleading as Japanese goods are mostly imported through agents in Bombay or Karachi and only a small amount of trade U done direct with Japan. Similarly, the share of ’Iraq - 18,4,f - does not give an accurate idea of the proportion of goods actually produced in that country, aa United Kingdom manufacturers generally appoint agents in Basra through whom the Kuwait merchants are obliged to order - a faot which has ear no little grievance amongst the latter owing to the loaves of commission whioh they thereby euffer and to the increased cost of their goods on account of 'Iraq customs' dues. Indian tea and rioe war# imported in large quantities, but the latter was challenged in price by the so-called Japanese rloe mentioned In the section on fghrain. Singapore coffee and Mombmesa coffee at 36 Rupees and 41 Rupees respectively per b&amp;g of 166 lbs shared the market. Malabar coffee, which was formerly in great demand, is no longer so on aeoount of its higher price - 56 Rupees per bag.&lt;4&gt; Soot.m. oontd the cheapest brand* of granulated augar were froa Sgjrpt a-*d Java, that of the former eountxy selling: at 10 Rupee* per ba* ot 2 owt» 9 and that of the latter at 9 itupeee 8 annas. ngllsh crystal sugar and rmteh crystal sugar sold at 9 Rupees 2 annas and 9 Rupees per bag of 168 lbs respeotlrely• v Japanese cement at one Rupee d annas appeared to be **** i*tG progress against Indian (Kathiawar) eeaent at 1 Rupee 8 annas. The wholesale prioe of the former, whleh has recently been imported on a large scale by Japanese steamers was 18 Rupees per ton C.I.F. Kuwait. Japanese piece goods filled the basaar to the almost entire exclusion of all others, ^ome all wool cloths (52 inohes width) made in England were on sale at 4 Rupees per yard but they had to compete with Japanese wooll-en cloths at one Rupee less per yard of the seme width. Japanese silks and artificial silks of all disoriptions were extremely popular on account of their cheapness, as an example of which, silk relTeteen at 8 annas per yard of 22 inohes width m^jr be quoted. As in Bahrain, Japanese bicycles by reason of their poor quality have not been a success and British machines were generally preferred. Japanese matches also, in spite of their lower prioe, have not been as popular as Swedish matches. These two instances are perhaps an indication of some appreela* tion of the real worth of an article and suggest that, given increased puroh&amp;sing power, there would be a demand for better olass articles. Exports.- exports consisted for ths most part of pearls to India and specie, hides and skins to f Iraq. Tht value of the pearls exported in 1932-84 was estimated at 515,800 Rupees as compared with 450,000 Rupees in the previous ysar. The prices quoted in this section were those ruling in September 1934.V X Till. MUSCAT. rrcneral.- The seaboard of the independent Sultanate of Muscat and Oman extends, with the exception of a small strip on the east side of the promontory separating the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of haan, from Tibat on the west side of this promontory to Has Dharbat All, a point on the southern coast of Arabia some 290 miles north of the Island of Socotra. Apart from two fertile stretches, the first comprising some 190 miles to the north west of the town of Muscat and fcnown as the Batinah, and the second the province of ^hofar in the extreme south, the coastal region is rocky and barren. In the interior, where the rule of the Sultan is little more than nominal, the country is for the most part mountainous and uncultivated. The higher inland ranges are wooded In places and generally fertile. Pates are grown extensively in the Batinah and limes, mangos and pomegranates flourish there as well as in the Oman hinterland. The port of Gwadur on the Male ran ooast with a portion of the surrounding territory also belongs to the Bultan of Muscat and has become important in recent years as a stopping place for Imperial Airways. The capital of the Sultanate is Muscat but the adjoining town of ICatrah is the ohief trading centre and the starting point of the caravan routes into the interior. The popula tions of the two towns are estimated at 4,500 and 8,500 respectively• The Government of India is represented by a Political Agent who is also E.M.6 b Jonsul. Customs*- Customs dues, which are levied on imports at the ad valorem rate of 5%, provide the main source of revenue, z* No export duty is levied but a charge of 5$ is imposed in JSuscat and at all ooastal towns on dates and other oommoditiee from the interlr Sec. tlll.oontd.

Transport*- Sailing vassal is the chief means of transport along the ooaet and in 1933-34 out of a total value of imports amounting to Rupsss 3,008,223. goods to the value of Rupees 1,098,300 were imported in sailing oraft and to the valus of Rupess 1,909,922 in steamers. The value of goods exported by these two fonts of transport amountsd to Rupess 387,420 and Rupess 1,493,890 respectively.

In accordance with jour InstmotIons I have the honour to report that I left Bushlre on tour on January 3rd, for Basra en route for 'await where I stayed from January 5th to 9th, From Kuwait to Bahrain I was very kindly given a passage toy Captain Creagh, Senior Ifaval Orfioer, Persian Gulf, in *Shorehaa' and his kindness and that of his officers did much to mitigate the effects of the weather we encountered, £. Ffce length of my visit to Bahrain from January 10th to January 16th and of my stay at Muscat from January 21st, to January 28th, was determined by the eailinga of the slow mail steamers which connect these ports, apart from enabling me to catch the fast mall stsamer from iCaraohi to dushlr# the utility of my call at Karachi was considerably restricted owing to the lateness of my arrival there and to the absence of several people to whom you so kindly gave me introductions, I arrived in Karachi on the evening of February 1st, and left on the morning of February 4th, 5. Itine rary, In brief, my itinerary was as follows s- Left Bushire January 3rd, arrived Basra January 4th, Left Basra * 5th, arrived Kuwait * 5th, Left Kuwait * 9th. arrived 3ahraln * 10th, left Bahrain * 16th. arrived Muscat * 21st, heft .usoat * 28th, arrived iarachi February 1st.

Probably the most simple expedient which the Shaikhs could sdopt would be to fix the value of each commodity, irres pective of quality, on the highest priced goods of each category entering the market. For example, supposing the market value of a piece of 40 yards of Kanohester cotton goods is say five ^er sent duty would amount to whereas the selling prloe of the same quality of Japanese goods Is say Instead of collecting duty at hi on these goods the duty would do fixed at 8 /- which in the case of the cheap goods would amount to 80&gt;* fhle would not of course increase the sale of Brit tab goods, tbs prices of which would still remain far above those M Japanese products, Out it would materially assist the revenue of the Arab Governments concerned. 18. Another possible method, and one whioh might prove more practicable, would be to determine the volume of the average annual consumption over a period of years and fix the duty oer unit on each commodity at a rate which, given normal consumption, 10 /-~ 4 - would yield the revenue required. 1 6 • iSLL* r*y of t he Hatl yea ._ Unfortunately tne result of the acute and prolonged depression in the pearl trade ie the inevitable ispoverlshiaent of the large number of aerchante, divers and all others engaged in the fisheries, so that the purohaee of a alnUnai quantity of roods and only of the cheapest qualities is bsoonlnr less a natter of choice than necessity, fhe dawn of prosperity abroad will doubtless eventually lead to the revival of the demand for pearls and the discovery and development of oil in the Arab states will hasten their eoonomio recovery. 14• British OomiKerolal Interests, In ths circumstances however, there is llttls to be done in face of the present Jupaneee invasion beyond the prepay ration of the markets in anticipation of bettor tlmea* how that the Arab States are being served by Imperial Airways in addition to ths weekly service of British hail Steamers, prinoipals of United ingdoa and Indian businesses should, I think, be encoura ged to study local requirements and possibilities on the spot, I do, of course, quite realiee the difficulty of securing suitable accomodation at places on ths Arab Coast but that, I think, la not insuperable. The oo-operation of imperial Airways by making their rest houtss available would probably be of asslatanoe In this connection. 15, Motor fr^ e. The development of motor transport is having an adverse effect on the Arab Btates which previously bred and exported large number# of camels and horses to the neighbouring countries which are now attracted by the advantages which mechanical transport affords.- 6 • 16* ?h« Atatna for aotor oar« In tiio various Ststss is still s»all and is oonfinsd to ths towns, fns wsalthilr aorohants who ssplrs to oars art inollnod to favour saloon aodols hut ths slroulatlon of air in Urn toursr typos is undouhtsdly hotter and oonssqusntly they are sore popular. I understand that Aasrl- oan manufacturers nave declined to adopt the suggestion that ths Osok window of saloon oars should be asds to open so as to create a thorough draught, which in tropical countries would doubtless be an advantage. I do not know if ooastruotional difficulties would interfere with ths introduotlon of this idea but it appears to b# worthy of oonsidoration. 1 *• ippolntmo at of ^ants* It is to bo hoped that ths present striot blockade of Kuwait by Ibn Saud will tomlnata and that a rasuaptlon of the trade with northern irabla will re-establish the importance of the pert of &lt;Uwait. In anticipation of this development aowevar, one point which United iiagdon manufacturers should consider is the appointment of suitable agents, it present the Inclusion of Kuwait in the territory of agents in Irak is the cause cf dis satisfaction to Kuwait merchants who assert that tha agents in Irak are more concerned with the protection of their markets in Irak than w th tha development of trade la Kuwait. They do not sea whl|y oommissiona and proflta of Kuwait trade should go to outside agents who seldom if ever visit ths place and are not in touoh with local conditions. Ac a result ef protests certain sub-agencies have been offered but terms arc usually so unfa vourable as to ensure rejection. It msy be considered thet the market le too insignificant to warrant the appointment of separate agents but, where the mcrohants consider that they have a grievance, persistence in the present peliey will only drive them to ether sources of supply.is. ike ooet of lux-soap was quoted to as as a typioal example, this soap is sold la Basra, where the duty Is £h , at three and a half annas per oaks. In India, where the duty Is 20 or wore, and at Singapore, it is said that the price Is three annas, hut the agent in Basra insists on a prloo of four annas in Kuwait where the duty is only 4^. the apparent reason for this being to prerent the oommodlty entering Irak through Kuwait and being sold at prloss below those demanded of Iraki merchants. Other markets a :eoted on account of similar grlsranots are those for Morris and othsr oars, tyres, cigarettes, aarlns engines and oil engines. 19 • ^alus of attraotlre paokl a£. In Bahrain, as in all the other States in the 3ulf, the import&amp;nee of bright colours and attraetirs packing should not be overlooked. Packet inscriptions and descriptive litera ture should where possible be in ^rabio, at least on one side of the packet. 20. Several incidents In connection with the methods of certain British suppliers, which have created an impression unfavourable to British intsrssts were brought to my notice in Bahrain. Details of the trouble which the rolltieal Agent encountered when, for patriotic reasons he ordered a British Motor Car, are already known to the Department of Overseas Trade and also, unfortunately, in Bahrain. 21. Messrs. Khunji's dlflloultles with J.if* Vnasha of Manchester over a consignment of ootton goods, about which there has been considerable official correspondence, have not Inspired eonfidsnos. SB. In another case, a man impressed by the advertisement in a British magazine of a well known London silversmith,plaoed order for two watohes. The firm in London wrote observing that as tbs climate of Bahrain was not suitable for the watohes ordered they had taken the liberty of sending two others which theyoonsldtrtd would t* aioro wuitwblo. fht watohes, whloh oo»t Ofr tt each, ware quite satisfactory out, an agent in the baaaar noticed then and, after close Inspection, said he could supply the same type of watch, which was not of British raanufaoture , at t a. 10 . 0 . The difference in price being obviously due to the duty payable in the United Kingdom on foreign watches. £3. An order for a rifle was sent to a firm of armourers in London who, in spite of their advertisement, regretted tnat they oould not supply so they passed the order to an agent in the United States of Atoerloa who sent an amerioan rifle and ammunition on which the freight and insurance amounted to more than the cost of the goods. £4. It Is quite realised that these may be Isolated oaeee but they do incalculable damage to British commercial prestige, and emphasise the necessity of a nationality marking on adver tising matter as well as on the actual goods themselves. 25. Currency . Although Indian Rupees are In circulation in the towns whloh l visited, and most of ths foreign trade Is conducted in that medium, the Maria Theresa Dollar is preferred in trade with the interior. £d. The Maria Theresa Dollar, current la Arabia and *orth kast Africa, is a silver currency with no Sovernment backing which is minted privately in Trieste and the value of which varies with the price of silver. It is a large eoin, probably larger than the five shilling pises previously minted in the United Kingdom, and is used almost exclusively by ths Bedoui^ especially those in ths interior. £?• 'f'hlle I was in *usoat two Indian merchants advanced an interesting suggestion for ths introduction of a msoatl currencyroplase tne existing Slarle Tbereee Dollar. the prioe of 100 M&amp;rla thereaa Dollar ie now fa 86 . the price of 100 tolas of silver Is fc 54. (Indian duty paid) which Rupees 18.18 Is said to ho Indian duty. fhe actual prloe of 100 tolas of silver is therefore I* 56.4 Rupees VO .8 for 200 Tolas. the amount of fine silver in 100 Maria fhereaa Dollar is 200 Tolas. fhe profit to the fira in Trieste Is aooordingly apparently t foipees 16.8, less oh&amp;rgee, per 100 Dollars. 28. It was suggested that a coin of tha same weight, appearance and size and containing the same amount of fine silver eight he elated In India whioh would he lees expensive. After allowing for a profit for India and possibly e Royalty for the Sultan it was claimed that the coin would he cheaper than the Maria Theresa Dollar and its introduction would benefit the export trade of the Stats. As most of the Unseat merchants are both exporters and importers and have their capital in rupees It was argusd that ths proposal would not affsct them adversely. They were also confi dant that / as the new coin would he in all respects similar to the ftaria Theresa dollar it would be acceptable to the drabs. 29. Aether this proposal is worthy of the lultan f s considera tion, whether it would be acceptable to India or indeed whether it Is at all practicable I should prefer to leave to other judgement.

In the light of such figures as are available the total Arab Coast imports of cotton piece goods would appear to amount in a good year to sone D400,000 of which b;y far the largest propoition is aosoibed by Bahrein; the principal entrepot for the marKets in the interior of North Eastern Arabia. Recent years have seen the rise of Bebai in Trucial Oman as a distributing centre of increasing importance. The ''''“v general trade potentialities of the area depend almost exclusively upon the pearl trade of the upper C-ulf and a very marked fading oif in the inport figures for 1950-1931 may be anticipated owing to the exception ally depressed condition of this industry at the present time. Statistics of imports covering the period 1st April 1927 to 31st i..arch 1930 are given in the second appendix to this report. British Imports . It is not possible to give any accurate idea of the extent of British inports and the percentage figures given in tne appendix are rough estimates only. They would suggest that British piece goods are imported to the value of some £50,0)0 only at the present time and there has undoubtedly been a considerable falling off in the last few years. Foreign imports have increased very appreciably of late. Japanese, Italian, Butch, Central European and more recently Russian goods have entered the marxet, which was formerly supplied almost ex clusively by Indian and British products. If the Japanese maintain their present rate of expansion they will soon be challenging the Indian position as the principal suppliers of the marxet, v/hile Russian goods, which are Just beginning to find tneir way into Kuwait, may be relied on to afford competition wnich to all intents and purposes ignores economic factors. It will not unlikely that with the restrictions now imposed by Persia on all imports the Russians may well seek an outlet for their Persian Gulf shipments on the Ajreb Coast. Possibil it ies of an inoreased British Trade . There seems no likelihood of a general growth in demand in the near future. The movement at present is all the oth3r way and ary revival would benefit lo\7 quality cheap priced goods, such as Japan supplies at present.3. 77ithout considerable reduction in price and quality it v.dll b difficult for Britisn products to recapture lost ground. J.'irect irportation from manufacturers is rarely resorted to. Small bazaar e stall keepers are frequently content to stocic themselves from larger local merchants who buy their cloth from importers in India and ’Iraq and not infrequently ma^e personal visits two or more times a year to either country in order to effect purchases. The market is very largely supplied tnrough agents in India - more particularly Bombay and Karachi - and local merchants frequently retail their goods on a commission basis of from l^r to 2^- per cent. The long-continued existence in Bahrain of a Hindu commercial community, mostly drawn from Tatta is Sind, has res’ulted in the iirports of cotton piece goods being mainly of the character most suited to the Indian marKets, for the local, rabs purchase such as are available in the bazaar. Thus the majority of English cotton piece goods imported in Bahrain come through the various Hindu fir •'•s, all of whom are branches of other firms in India. Payment is arranged through Banks in India or in the case of Bahrein the shipping documents may be sent to the local branch of the Eastern Bank for surrender against cash. C.I.E. destination is un doubtedly the best method of quoting as it enables the local Trader, working to very narrow margins of profit, to Know exactly where he stands when ordering. Foreign competitors, especially the Japanese seem very ready to go after the market and find out what the local trader wants. Also once having established connection they frequently ofi’cr new patterns aid give close attention xo their clients suggestions and requirements. In this connection it should be borne in mind tnat local tastes and fashions frequently change - a particular print that happens to catch on when introduced cannot be expected to maintain its popularity indefinitely. The Japanese hav? realised tnis, and when local traders go down to Karachi and Bombay 1 to obtain new ideas and stoexs against the return of the pearling fleets in October, they are ready for them with new designs. If British manufacturers are prepared to go to the trouble of corresponding with merchants, sending samples aid giving attention to suggestions received, they could maintain much closer touch with the market. It is doubtful if the expense of senaing representatives to make personal investigation of local conditions would be warranted. The reason, above all others, for the popularity of co^etitive goods is their cheapness, also to a lesser extent the fact that definite efforts are made to most local tastes. It is very doubtfulif British manufacturers will be abls to compete unless they are willing to produce the inferior grades of cloth that the Japanese are offering and at similar prices. Sugg estions fo r Popularis ing British goods. The main causes for the falling off of the demand for British goods are ;- 1. British manufacturers often leave it to the local merchants to approach them instead of soliciting orders. 2. British goods are too expensive. 3. They are too good and their quality is not appreciated 'by the average purchaser. The first step to be taicen to popularise British goods therefore is for United Kingdom Exporters to communicate with local dealers send ing samples giving rupee prices C.i.P. destination and inviting comments. Thereafter it is largely a question of reducing prices and special attention to designs which should be varied as frequently as possible. Once the interest of local dealers has been aroused there is little scope for further advertisement of products - the general public is illiterate. While the market of Bahrain is not a very large one, yet it seems desirable to encourage merchants having business connections with the mainland of Arabia to extend their trading and there appears to be a definite opening in this direction through tne local Hassawi mer- cnants, provided that tne British manufacturers are prepared to enter into active competition witn tne steady inflow of Indian manufactured piece goods. This can be effected by offering piece goods that are cheap, lasting, and of bright designs. The running of the Bahrain market could be done by correspondenc with the local traders, submitting a wide range of samples, and quoting c.i.f. Bahrain (in sterling, or preferably in Indian currency), with terms of cash against documents at the local branch of the Eastern Banic Ltd. , and supported oy an attractive discount. From this method a steadily improving trade might be looked for.Trc.de Clarks etc. , should, whenever desired, be sliovm in Arabic, at the iriport er* s option; and it is particularly import ant that the actual shrunk length of the pieces should be exactly as printed on the pieces, certainly not less. Under no circumstances should a quotation be f.c.b., port of supplying country, because the local trader is always anxious to ascertain closely what his import will cost him before receipt, as he works to a margin of profit of a few annas. Po ssibility of Increased O oejpet it ion. Cheap shoddy goods are unfortunately admirably suited to the market and it seems probable that imports of Japanese goods will in crease owing to their cheapness and there is a likelihood tnat Italian goods will come forward in small but increasing quantities as their designs are very pleasing. Opening up T ra de Relations . A circular letter accompanied if possible by samples, to suit able merchants would appear the best method - preferably in Arabic, since few, other than among the Hindu Community, understand or write English. As a general rule business on a commission basis would seem most suited to local requirements and most favoured by dealers. Customs etc. The cost of importing goods into Bahrain is reasonable, being: (l) Landing Charges, payable to the Steamers’ Agent, (2) Import Yard charges (i.e. ViTarehouse Rent, porterage, pier fees and municipal tax), and (5) Import Duty at 5 per cent ad valorem. The whole of these expenses would aggregate a little less than 7 per cent ad valorem, but where cargo is re-shipped direct to the mainland of Arabia, a re fund is granted of three per cent ad valorem. Customs storage is safe, and clearances are very prompt.PACT II. (Deeding more particularly v/ith the mar ice t in the Principality of Kuwait). Loc al Production . No cotton piece goods of any Kind are manufactured in Kuwait, The chief cloth manufactured and then in primitive style, is called 'Barry Bisht”, and is exclusively used for majking 'Bishts' or Arab cloaks (mown elsewhere as 'Abbahs'). This cloth is woven from sheeps f wool and the thread is spun locally by poorer class of Arabs as a sort of spare-time hobby. “Barry Bisht“ cloth is available in two quantities: the first of a coarse and thick texture, which is used by men and women alike for their winter cloaks, and the second, of a finartexture, which is mainly used by men only for their summer cloaks. This “Barry Bisht' is usually available in lengths of 6 to yards and costs on an average from £0.10-8 to £0.13.4 a piece. A roll or piece, sufficient for one cloaK, takes from 4 to 6 days to weave. A similar cloth woven from camel-wool is also available at a iiigher cost and is known as “V/ubbar'. This is for the most part manufactured at the Persian Seaboard and in the district of DASHTI. There is a third kind of very coarse cloth which is universally used among the Nomad Bedouin of the interior for making their tents. It is woven by tribal women from goats and sheep hair into long strips ij- feet wide, and in lengths as desired. A length 25 feet long costs £0.8.0 approximately. Five strips go to make the roof of each tent, while other strips are used for the sides,usually another five. Imports of British Goods . It is most difficult to give exact figures of the proportion of piece goods inported into Kuwait from Great Britain, as a considerable amount of this commodity is imported via India and Ircaq, and is given out by local shopkeeper to be of Snglish origin. There can however be little doubt that whereas they are marketed as British goods, they are mostly of foreign manufacture. On the other hand nearly all prints are imported from lianchester, and are available in many textures and shades. I^mport of Foreign Goods . Apart from the difficulty of obtaining detailed information 6.pertaining to piece goods, loed merchants are al /'ays ext re eiy shy of disclosing correct wholesale prices and figures given in the appendix of this report have only been obtained with grea.t difficulty. The term 'piece goods' of course embraces many kinds, qualities and grades of cloth, but the main lines of foreign piece goods obtainable in the Kuwait bazaar are:- (1) Long cloth or sheeting. (2) Artificial silks. (5) Muslinette and Voile. (4) Imitation woollen material or flannelette. (5) Head-cloths or Khaffiyas. (6) Coarse silk faoric known as ' JfiZZ 'o (1) Long clo th sheeting is avilable in different grades and textures and is principally inported from Russia, Japan, America and China while a good deal comes from Manchester. Russian sheeting which is not as yet i^orted in large quantities, but which shows a distinct signs of increasing, finds its way in Kuwait by dhow and mostly from lio hammer ah, where from all accounts it continues to arrive in enor-TOus quantities with other Russian cotton goods. Japanese, American, Snglish end Chinese sheeting is either imported via J 'Irac and India or direct. It is obtainable in crea' 1 '. and white and the prices vary according to the quality, width and texture as will be seen from the different accompany ing samples. American, Japanese end Cninese sheeting is the most popular in Kuwait, as the first is claimed to be very durable, and the latter cheaper and therefore in great demand among the poorer class of Arabs for making their long shirts (Disdashas). (2) Artificial Silk is steadily gaining popularity in Kuwait. It is now greatly in demand by Arab ladies of the middle and well-to-do classes for purposes of dresses. Japan and in particular Italy are the main sources from thich the supply is inported, though Austria is now coming into the market. The artificial silk goods are of good quality and of great variety and colour, types D, S and V mentioned in the appendix being especially papular.inferior silK frovn China is siso procurable in smaller quantities, hut silks imported from Italy preponderate, (3) iviusline tte and Voile are also imported from India and Italy respectively. The former is available in different shades especially blacrv, and is almost universally used by Arab ladies of all classes for their long trailing overall garment called 'Thob”. Voile is used for tt Thob H also, as well as for dresses, particularly that bear ing the embroidered floral design, shown in the appendix under Type A. ( 4 ) Imitation w ool l e_n material or f lannelette is imported from Japan. It is worn by every Arab woman of Kuwait (lower and middle classes) during the winter months, and takes the places of what the West knows as woollen undergarments. (5) He ad-clot hs of ’’IJi affiyas' . Those of woollen manufacture for the cold Arabian winter are imported from India primarily and are sold at a price ranging from £0.6.8 to £0.9,4 each. A few come from Germany and are slightly cheaper. Cotton 'Khaffiyas' rea dand blue are principally drawn from Manchester, and the popular kind can be purchased for £0.14. These are of course of different sizes and those commonly available ere from 14 to 48 inches square. The plain white cotton Khaffiya with fringed edge is however rapidly gaining in popularity especially in the desert, and is a line British manu facturers could well take up. (6) T he s ilk f abric kn o wn as Jezz (made of silk westings) has an enormous popularity and in winter is used by almost everyone in Kuwait and among the tribes, as a warm overgarment to the flannelette under garment mentioned in 4, above. It is imported in rolls of 16 yards long at £0.10.0 for the best quality. It is in natural colour and purchasers dye it locally a grass green, black, brown and maroon colours according to taste. British manufacturers would do well to try and capture this marieet. Pos s ibilities of increased British trade . Cotton goods and artificial silks constitute by fax the most iriportant import of manufactured goods and is one in which the British position is being fiercely attacked by strong Italian and Japanese conpetitioru The total value of the imports of piece goods daring the last year viz. from 1st April 1929 to 31st March 1930 amounted to £39,023 which was accounted for as underi-(1) India (including re dxports) £32,069 (2) Iraq do. do. 4,280 O) Persian Coast. 2,085 (4) Arab Coast 402 (5) Countries not specified. 186 Total £ 39,023 As already mentioned it is very difficult to find out exactly vviiat proportion of a- ount 3 (ij and (2) is shared among the principal competing countries since a great part of the piece goods trade comes tlirough India or Iraq, and is shown as ’’of Indi an origin ” in the local Customs figmres. But generally speaking British piece goods come via Iraq, and Japanese, Italian etc. via India. Considering the ^hole aspect of the trade and the low nominal 4&gt;o ad valorem Custom duty charged on goods landing at Kuwait, there would appear to be a f&lt;' r more promising field for an increased Biitish trace in Kuwait then at presort is the case but British firms will have to come down in their prices so as to compete ”dth the artificial silks, slieetiiigs and other cotton fabrics imported from Italy, America, China, Russia and Japan. It should be realized that most of the people of Kuwait exo not fax removed from the Bedouin nomad, ans as such are not educated enough yet to r ealize the value of, and tne saving on a good article. This is on? of the chief and foremost reasons why foreign piece goods find a better market and are more appreciated than British goods. Foreign manufacturers appear also to study' local requirements more than British firms do, for instance Japan has realized that the white cotton ■'Test or singlet with circular collar is the garment wanted by divers and sailors of the Gulf in summer. She has accordingly gone for their market and captured it. Similarly Italy is trying to capture the local 'quilt' trade b, flood ing the market with cheap but veiy good tartan rugs which are sold at £0.12.0 and £0.14.8 and which she hopes will oust the quilt. She probably mill succeed, for the article is very popular. British firms might with a a vantage try pushing their trade by means of Arabic and Persian speaking travelling agents, whom one very' rarely sees in tnis part of tne world. Is regards trading methods common to the market, direct importation from tne manufacturers in foreign countries is not oftendon3 as most of tho local mar chants have thsar agents in India end in Iraq through v.hoin they transact business, bo';h on cojrmssion and purchasing basis, the method of quoting being almost invariably c.i.f. destination, and f.o.b. port of supplying countxy. Suggostions for popularising__Sritish gpcds. The best procedure for firms desiring to open up trade relat ions for the first time with local merdhants, is for them to send several copies of catalogues, and scoplo books of goods which have to offer, to the Political Agent at Kuwait. It is most important that these should quote prices in rupees as well es sterling. The Political ' gent '.Till be glad to circulate literature etc. amongst merchants as weir as forward addresses should any Lritish fl.ru 'wish to comouricate with local merchants. a.s stated elsewhere in this report, there are very fe\i mercumts who import goods direct, but the f ew that do, and whose financial standing is said to be sound, are obtainable from the Department of Overseas Trade. P ossioilitp of increased co nT peti.tion . Jap ones As mentioned aoove fierce competition exists already from and Italian manufacturers. America, Austria and India are increasing their business, whilst the competitor most to be feared is Russia v/hich is just starting to gef her piece goods into Kuwait at cut-throat prices. Once she gets nold she will be hard to 'Knock out M , for the Arab is poor and. will bpy the cheapest article he can especially in the present extremely serious economic situation in which he finds himself owing to the failure of the pearl trade of the last two years. Give him more money and he will Uy better goods but as long as he is poor he will go for the cheapest article always. The names and addresses of the principal importers of -piece goods in the Arabian const districts of the Persian Gulf can be ob tained on application to the Department of Overseas Trade.

Extent of the market and its sources of Supply. SECTION I. Ceneral. 1. The area erntTaced by this report comprises the Principalities of Kuwait and Bahrein, the Shaikh- doms of Tiucial Oman and the Sultanate of IZuscat. Bashire, Bandar Abbas, Eohammerah and other places in Persian Territory fall within the Province of His Britannic Majesty’s Commercial Secretary at Tehran and are not included. 2. In the light of such figures as are available the total Arab Coast imports of cotton piece goods would appear to amount in a good year to some £ 400,000 of which by far the largest proportion is absorbed by Bahrein; the principal entrepot for the markets in the interior of North Eastern Arabia. Recent years have seen the rise of Debai in Trucial Oman as a distributing centre of increasing impor tance. The general trade potentialities of the area depend almost exclusively upon the pearl trade of the upper Culf and a very marked falling off in the import figures for 1930-1931 may be anticipated owing to the exceptionally depressed condition of this industry at the present time. Statistics of imports covering the period 1 st. April 1927 to 31st March 1930 are given in the third appendix to this report. A. Local Production. There is none. B. British Imports. It is not possible to give any accurate idea of the extent of these and the percentage figures given in the above table are rough estimates only. They would suggest that British piece goods are imported to the value of some £ 50,000 only at th9 pra3ent time an&lt;i Has undoubtedly been»* • * r■■■■I a oonsidera'ble falling off in the last few years. C. FOHEiail niPQRTS. fhese have increased very appreciably of late. Japanese, Italian, mitch, Central European and more recently Russian goods have entered the market which was formerly supplied almost exclusively hy Indian and British products. If the Japanese maintain their present rate of expansion they will soon be challengirrigthe Indian position as the principal suppliers of the market, while Russian goods, which are just beginning to find their way into Kuwait may be relied on to afford competition which to all intends and purposes ignores economic/ factors at will. It seems not unlikely' that with the restrictions now imposed by Persia on all imports the Russians may well seek an outlet for their Persian Gulf shipments on the Arab Coast. SECTIOIT II. Possibilities of an increased British Trade. A. There seems no likelihood of a general growth in demand in the near fdture. The movement at present is all the other way. In any case the British market is a shrinking one and as matters stand any revival would benefit low quality cheap priCe^p^- goods, such as are being supplied by Japan, almost exclusively. B. (1) Without considerable reduction in price and quality British products cannot hope to recapture lost ground. Direct importation from manufacturers is rarely resorted to. Small bazaar stall keepers are frequently content to wHo stock themselves from larger local merchants Jxiy their cloth from importers in India and T Iraq. and not infre quently make personal visits two or more times a year to either country in order to effect purchases. The market is very largely supplied through agents in India - more particularly Bombay and Kar achi - and local merchants frequently retail their goods on a commission basis of from l-£ to per cent. Payment is arranged throughIII. BarOca in India or in the case of Bahrein the shipping documents may be sent to the local brannk of the Eastern Bank for surrender a ainst cash. C.I.F. destination is undoubtedly the best method of quoting as it enables the local Trader, working to very narrow margins of profit, to know exactly where he stands when ordering. (2) Foreign competitors, especially the Japanese seem far more ready to go after the market and find out what the local trader wants, .also once having established connection they frequently offer new patterns and give close attention to their clients suggestions and require ments. In this connection it should be borne in mind that local tastes and fashions frequently change - a particular print that happens to catch on when introduced cannot be expected to maintain its popularity indefinitely. The Japanese have realised this, and when local traders go down to Karachi and Bombay to obtain new ideas and stocks against the return of the pearling fleets in October, they are ready for them with new designs. If British manufacturers are prepared to go to the trouble of corresponding with merchants, sending samples^ giving attention to suggestions received, they could maintain much closer touch with the market. It is doubt ful if the expense of sending representatives to make personal investigation of local conditions would be warranted. (3) The reason, above all others, for the popularity of competitive goods is their cheapness, also to a lesser extent the fact that definite efforts are made to meet local tastes (see (2) above). It is very doubtful if British manufacturers will be able to complete unless they are willing to produce the Inferior grades of cloth tnat the Japanese are offering and at similar prices. SECTION III. Suggestions for Popularising British goods&gt;■■■Ml for British goods are 1. British manufacturers leave it to the local The main causes for the falling off of the demand merchants to approach them instead of soliciting orders. 2. British goods are too expensive. 3. They are too good and their quality is not appre ciated by the average purchaser. The first step to be tahen to popularise British goods therefore is for United Kingdom Exporters to communicate with local dealers sending samples giving rupee prices C.I.F. destination and inviting comments. Thereafter it is largely a question of reducing prices and special attention to designs which should be varied as frequently as possible. Once the interest of local dealers has been aroused there g, is little scope for further advertisaent of products - A the general public is illiterate. Attention is invited to LIr de Grenier T s remarks under this heading in his report on the Bahrein market. This point has already been mentioned. See section I C and II A above. Cheap shoddy Japanese goods are unfor tunately admirably suited to the market. The Residency Agent 3hargah T s remark (See section 2 under the second Heading of his report) to the effect that Japanese goods have a ready sale as the quality if good and the price cheap, though doubtless surprising to a cloth expert, is never the less indicative of general opinion. This is dealt with under Section III. A circular letter accompanied if possible by samples, to merchants named in the attached list would appear the best method - preferably in Arabic, since few, other than among the Hindu Community, understand or v/rite English.

The total value of the imports oi piece goods during the laet year viz from 1st April 1989 ^ 3l8t Qroh 1S30 amounted to £ 39,083 which was account- e&amp; for as under:* {!} India (including re -.Reports) &amp; 3g,069 (2) Iraq -do- -do- (3) Persian Coast (4) Arab Coast (3) Countries not specified* Total?.39,023 ~s already mentioned it is very difficult to find out exactly what proportion of amounts (1} and (8) is shared among to the principal competing eountries since a great pert of the piece goods trade comes through Indin 4,880 8,086 408 186. ®r Iraq, end is shown as-0- ■ 1 as 'rtf InH n origin” in the local Custone figures. ut generally speaking British piooo goods oom© via Ira.: # and Japanese, etc via India* (b) Considering the whole aspect of the trade and the low nominal 4, ad valorem Custom duty charged on goods lan&amp;in * an increased British trade in Kuwait than at present is the ease but British firms will have to come down in their prices so as to compete with the imitation silks, sheetings and other cotton fabrics imported from Italy, =merioa, China, Russia and Japan* It should be realised that most of the people of uwait are not far removed from the Bedouin nomad, artf as such are not educated enough yet to realize the value of, and the saving on a good article, fhis is one of the chief and foremost reasons why forein^ piece odds find a better market and are more appreciated than British goods. Foreign manufacturers appear also to study local renuirements more than British firms do, for instance Japan has realized that the white cotton weal vest or singlet with circular collar is the garment wanted by Divers and sailors of the Gulf in summer, ^he has accordingly gone for their market and captured it. Similarly Italy is trying to capture the local '^uilt* trade by flooding the market with cheap but very good tartan rugs which are sold at £ 0 - 12-0 and £0-14-8 and which sho hopes will oust the jmilt. Bhe probably will succeed, tar the article is very popular. British firms rai^it with advantage try pushing their trade by means of Arabic and Terel an speaking Travelling agents, whom one very rarely sees in this part of the world. (oO As regards trading methods common to the market, direct importation from the manufacturore in lorign countries is not often done as most of the local merchants ami have their Agents in India and in Ira through whom they transact business, both on ooimission and purchasing basis, the method of ruoting being almost invariably c.i.f. destination, and f.o.b.

Dated the 28th March, 1931. From To The Director of Oustoms and Port Officer, Bahrain. H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. In further reference to your Demi-official letter No. 112 of the 28th January, 1931, and to the desire of the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for a report upon the position of the local market for Cotton Piece Goods, I have the honour to state The commercial prosperity of Bahrain and the Arab side of the Persian Gulf almost entirely depends upon the pros perity of the pearling market; and consequently a prosperous season would be followed by a noticeable increase in imports of piece-goods, both in quality and in quantity. The last pearling season having been exceptionally bad, imports have also decreased. Consequently a statistical report for the past year (1930) would not, I think, be a fair indication of the volume of trade normally passing through Bahrain. If you pre fer it, I will prepare statistics for the three years, 1927, 1928 and 1929, all reasonable prosperous years. The long-continued existence in Bahrain of a Hindu commercial community, mostly drawn from Tatta in Sind, has re sulted in the imports of cotton piece-goods being mainly of the character most suited to the Indian markets, for the local Arabe purchase such as are available in the bazar. Thus the majority\ Page -: 2 :- of English cotton piece goods imported here come through the various Hindu firms, all of whom are branches of other firms in India# MARKET &amp; SPURGE OF SUPPLY. (a) Local production is Nil* Imports of British goods can be reasonably estimated at about ten per cent of the total quantity imported* (b) (c) During the past few years there has been a notice able intrusion into the local market of Japanese goods, and to a much less extent of Italian and Austrian* The Japanese goods are very poor in quality, but the Italian and Austrian are mixtures of better quality; and I have included samples to show as fully as possible the nature of the trade done here* The marked local preference for Indian cotton piece goods is because they are (1) available, (2) cheap, and (3) are what the Arabs are most accustomed to use* The first two reasons are the most cogent. POSSIBILITIES OF INCREASED BRITISH TRADE* The possibility of an increase of British Imports is not very great, and its extension would, in my opinion, mainly depend upon the development by the local traders of their connections with the mainland of Arabia. (It will be recalled that a poetical name for Bahrain is !, The Front Door of Arabia’ 1 )* The possibility of United Kingdom traders securing, at the expense of their competitors, a larger share in the existing trade undoubtedly depends upon the enterprise shown by United Kingdom traders* (1) The trading methods general to the market are that the majority of the local piece goods merchants buy their goods on a commission basis of 1£ per cent to 2 per cent through their Indian associates in Bombay. But there are two1 Page 3 local Jewish firms who huy their goods direct from England. The method is that shipping documents are paid for at the local branch of the Eastern Bank Ltd., a method which I have consistently recommended. Bahrain is not a very large one, yet it has been my policy whenever possible to encourage merchants having business connections with the mainland of Arabia to extend their trad ing; and I am convinced that there is a definite opening in this direction through the local Hassawi merchants, provided that the British manufacturers are prepared to enter into active competition with the steady inflow of Indian manufac tured piece goods. (2) and (3) This can be effected by offering piece goods that are (1) cheap, (2) lasting, and (3) of bright designs pretty similar to the enclosed samples. There is no need for any special effort in the way of representation service or adver tising, other than mentioned below, if British merchants are prepared to nurse a small market in the hope of future in creases. the local traders, a list of whom I enclose, submitting a wide range of samples, and quoting c.i.f. Bahrain (in sterling, or preferably in Indian currency), with terms of cash against documents at the local branch of the Eastern Bank Ltd., and supported by an attractive discount. From this method I think a steadily improving trade might be looked for; but I have noted with a little regret that Continental traders seem to be more accommodating in this respect than the British merchants. in Arabic, at the importer 1 s option; and it is particularly important that the actual shrunk length of the pieces should be exactly as printed on the pieces, certainly not less, as has sometimes been found to be the case with some Indian While it must be remembered that the market of I think this could be done by correspondence with Trade Marks etc., should, whenever desired, be shownmanufactured pieces. Under no circumstances should a quotation be i.o.b., port of supplying country, because the local trader is always anxious to ascertain closely what his import will cost him before receipt, as he works to a margin of profit of a few aonas. In regard to shipping British goods, I have ooserved that the most satisfactory method is by the Strick Lines Ltd, whose steamers sail regularly from the United Kingdom direct to Bahrain, and consequently the risk of loss by pilferage in transit is eliminated. It is to be remembered that in the year 1928, a partner in the great firm of Hajy Aly Akbar Ltd of Manchester visited Bahrain, and studied the market with me, and he con cluded that there was no necessity for a special visit by a British representative to encourage the local trade. POPULARISING BRITISH GOODS, This could be done by the regular despatch of a good range of samples, and of calendars printed in English and Arabic (if possible with the Arabic calendar in addition to the English) in a bold pictorial type showing views of English scenery or famous public buildings, out not pictures of females. The most popular colours for such calendars are red, white, and green; and I have noticed that the Singer Sewing Machine Coy’s calendars are of this type, and are to be found everywhere in Arabia. Other advertising media such as pencils pocket-knives, pocket-books, are unnecessary, as they are not applied to advertising purposes, but are sold in the oazar by petty traders. A calendar bearing s simple map of Arabia, with the wording and the t! sales-talk” printed in Arabic would be very popular, but would naturally be sent to regular cus tomers. The packing of British piece-goods can hardly be improved upon, and is, in fact, most suitable to the local conditions of transport.Page 5 POSSIBILITIES OF INQRBASEI) GQLiPETITIQN. I am certainly of opinion that there will in future be an increase in the imports of Japanese piece-goods (Soohali) due to their cheapness, and there is a likelihood that Italian goods will come forward in small but steadily increasing quan tities, as their desigis are very pleasing. OPENING- UP TRADE RELATIONS. c.i.f. quotations. CUSTOMS ETC. The cost of importing goods into Bahrain is reason able, being: (1) Landing Charges, payable to the Steamers’ Agent, (2) Import Yard charges (i.e. Warehouse rent, porterage, cent ad valorem. The whole of these expenses would aggregate a little less than 7 per cent ad valorem, but where cargo is re-shipped direct to the mainland of Arabia, a refund is grant^ showing (a) the local name, (b) Country of origin, (c) Width, (d) Invoice value, (e) landed value, (f) wholesale price, and (g) retail price. and suggest that reference as to financial standing etc., might be taken up from the local branch of the Eastern Bank Ltd., possible to be obtained locally, and would ask, please, for the payment to me of the sum of fifteen rupees, being the cost I suggest an ordinary trade letter to the firms mentioned below, supported by a good range of samples with pier fees and municipal tax), and (3) Import Duty at 5 per -ed of 3 ^ ad valorem.

The Under Secretary cf State for India, India Office, LONDON. 5 JANJWJ Y2 - (v*? M} 1* Of the trades chosen, Nc.l would seem to offer the most promising field for investigation. Cotton goods constitute by far the most important import of manufactured goods, and is one in which the British position is being seriously attacked by strong tL Japanese ocmpeticn. The total annual value of this trade in Kuwait, Banrein, Dibai and Muscat normally ammunts to seme £.400,000. Hew this is snared among the principal ccmpetiters is hard to say, since almost the whole (in Kuwait a considerable proportion is imported from *Iraqj is imported through India and is shown as of Indian origin in Customs figures, but there is little doubt that, whereas formerly a large pro portion of the imports Here of British origin, they are now most definitely Japanese, which country's entry into the market, at any rate as regards Cotton prints, appears to be of very recent date. As regards No.2,the market affords little scope. Head cloths of cotton or wool (imported through, or more often manufactured in, India) and to a lesser extent pieces of striped silk of suitable size for similar use, are displayed in the bazaars. Handker chiefs as such are scarcely, if indeed ever, used-, certainly only by a very restricted section of the community. Artificial silks, in the piece seems to be gaining popularity and are used for dress by women of the more well to do classes. Japan and Italy appear^ to be the principal sources of supply, the former very definitely preponderating; no Italian silk or artificial silk being seen in bazaars south of Bahrein. On the whole inferior silks from China and Japan seem more favoured, since they compete with the former in price. The total value of the silks and artificial silks imported in the whole area concerned probablyprobably dees net exceed £,50,000 annually. With regard te the aheve observations the attached memorandum and samples may prove of in terest. As regards Nc.3 openings are practically non existent and the very limited demand is met by cars of the Ford and Chevrolet type only cars of this price and power could be expected to find a market # Roads, however, are being opened up in Muscat and this is leading to a small demand for cars there though the unprecedented depression in the pearl market is of course retarding development. What would appear to offer a far more premising field is the marine engine market, in which Kelvin and Thcrnycrcft at present hold a virtual monopoly. The demand is for engines of 50 to 100 h.p. for use in the dhows of Pearl dealers who go cut to the diving iaxks banks to effect their purchases, &amp;nd in launches oelonging to merchants. The demand is growing steadily: the simple, reliable engines manufactured by the above makers are exactly what are required and i trust that they will spare no effort to maintain their position, to popularise fe the use of auxiliary motors in dhows and extend their trade. As regards the question of obtaining trade information regularly from the Arab Coast, I shall be glad to transmit any questionnaires that m I may receive from the Department of Overseas Trade to the Political Agents and to collate their replies* It is doubtful whether the Political Agent, Bahrein, who is nowadays very hard worked will be a ole to devote much time personally to such enquiries, but the Director of Customs is an Englishman and, of course, in close touch with the mercantile community,and he has undertaken to place statistics at the disposal of the Political Agent and to give him any information that he may require* On my recent tour I was further enabled through the courtesy of His Majesty*s Minister to take with me Mr* Vice-Gcnsul Blanch, to whom I am greatly in** dehted for the compilation of the attached femcrandum , collection of samples etc* He deals with all commercial matters in my office, and 1 am confident that if His Majesty # s Vice-Consul at Bushire is enabled to visit the Arab Coast in my company once or twice a year, it will be of great assistance to myself and the local Officers and ultimately I hope to benefit to British trade* The market may not at present be large, but the standard of li/ing io rising, and with it will come an increased ^enand goods of a better quality* At any rate the Japanese seem to think it worth cultivating, and I wcuxd invite your attention to the remarks contained in Mr* Blanch's Memorandum regarding their methods* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*HK!0HAIT3&gt;UII. A1U3 COAST MARKETS. The following are the principal conclusions regarding the main factors governing the Arab Coast market drawn from a rapid survey of the bazaars and from statements made by merchants at Kuwait, Bahrein, Debai and Muscat of money, due to an almost unprecedented depre ssion in the pearl trade upon which the purchasing power of the Arab Coast almost exclusively depends* The bulk of the population are extremely poor - lead a veiy primitive life - have very simple wants - almost totally ignore quality, and are influenced in their purchases entirely by cheapness• Cotton cloth forms the basis of most of the clothing worn by all sections of the comunity except the ruling and big merchant classes who constitute a small fraction of the whole. There is eveiy where very definite evidence of a great rise in popularity of Japanese goods. Cloth merchants almost invariably produce those of Japanese origin first when asked to display and provides a means of access to a far larger market than is possibly realised, while the virtual 1: There is at present time a universal tightness their stocks, and this predominance also extends to such articles as Enamel-ware, Crockery, Haberdashery ana the like. Debai occupies an important position as a distributing centre for the whole Trucial Coast absence&gt; 2 . absence of inrport duties enables it to under dut Bahrein as the entrepot for this area. It follows from 2 and 3 above that the major portion of the total textile imports are cotton and that only the more inferior grades are likely to suit the requirements of the market - a tendency which seems likely to become accentuated as a result of the prevai ling slump. The attached samples were collected with * a view to illustrating, veiy roughly, what would appear to meet the principal demand^, in shirting, prints, mulls and artificial silks, while at the same time being fairly representative of the class of goods wfa± with which Japanese manufacturners are meeting it.LIST OF CLOTH S^I^LES. Siil.TLES HQS 1, 2 t and 5. (Bleached Shirtings) ITinnher 1 is a Manchester cloth which formerly enjoyed a big sale before the advent of Japanese compe tition with inferior grades, and is now of rather better quality than the market demands. Ho great quantities are stated to be sold. Price 1 x 40 yards Es 7/3 to 7/l2 C.I.F. (Bahrein, Debai, Muscat). Sample Ho 2 (Messrs McUulty Podard Co, 'Mettle Brand Ho: 1300') and Ho: 3 (Japanese) supply a big demand. The C.I.F. price was stated at Debai to be Rs 5/8 for the Japanese and Rs 6 /- for the Manaliester product. These two samples were put forward by a Hindu merchant as an example of the way Japanese goods are ousting British. The Japanese cloth is cheaper, also inferior. Owing however to coarser twist it gives the impression of greater thickness ana strength and is consequently preferred by the local inhabitants, to whom it appears not only cheaper but better - the factor of durability not being taken into account by them. LOS 4 ADD 5. (Unbleached Shirtings &amp; Sheeting) Sample Ho 4 (Toyoda Mills,Japan) is illustrative of a type of cloth used largely by the poorer people in winter. It is stated that this used to be offered wholesale for about Es 9 the price of 38” x 40 yards,but the price has now come down 25Jb since last year, ana the supply is almost exclusively Japanese. It is frequently dyed in Bombay with fast colour, which adds 8 to 12 annas to the cost of the piece. Sample Ho: 5 (Tubshan &amp; Co Japan) is similarly used for winter clothing. Piece 36' x 30 yards wholesale price about Es 4/-. Sample.SAl-PLE NO: 6 . fiJalls) irulls appear to be the one line in which the British position is not challenged. The attached sample is submitted as being of interest. Hanchester ^Trey Hulls dyed in this manner in Bombay are extensively used by women for wear in public all along the Trucial Coast, dyed with indigo in Bombay the price C.I.F. Debai is Rs 5/- for the piece of 48 n x 20 yards. SAIIPLES NOS: 7, 8 , 9. (Cott on Prints) These are fairly representative of the general run of prints seen in the bazaars in most places and are in each case Japanese, the piece being made up in length of 36” x 41 yards; ITo 7. Huscat price Rs 8/8 C.I.F. No 8 . Bahrein ” Rs 7/8 approximately (offered at 4 to 5 annas the yard) No 9. Debai ” Rs 6/8 C.I.F. Merchants state that the Japanese cotton manufacturers are making big efforts to popularise their prints. Once a trader has placed an order they continue to keep him posted with new patterns and qualities at intervals, through their agents in Bombay and pay great attention to their clients suggestions and requirements. Orders are said to be executed very much more promptly than is the case with Manchester firms. In Nuwait Italian prints of similar price and quality to the Japanese were being retailed at about 5 annas the yard and stated to be selling in good quantities. Merchants keep in touch with the piece goods market mainly through Baghdad, and Japanese predominance is not so marked as further South. SAMPLES NOS: 10,11,12,13,14. (Artificial Silks) These are fairly representative of the generality(gh^ of artificial silks seen on the bazaar stalls in lahrein and ITuscat. The first three are from lahrein where offered retail at 6, 8, and 12 annas respectively the yard of 26' width, and are Japanese.

V/ith reference to their memorandum 33599/21/1930 of October the 24th regarding the compiling of market reports in the Persian Gulf, the Department of Overseas Trade now desire to receive from His Majesty^ Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, as part of the 1931 programme of market investigations, information on the market for cotton dress materials (piece goods) on the Arab side of the Gulf. 2. Should Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe find it necessary to request other officers to furnish him with information for their districts, it is desired that he collate their reports, together with the information obtained by himself, into one single memorandum, for issuing to United Kingdom firms. The form hitherto largely used, of question and answer, should be avoided. A list of standard headings is enclosed and it may be varied when applicable and convenient. It is desired that copies of any reports from other officers should be attached to Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe f s memorandum so that the Department may have at their disposal detailed information on the various districts. 3. At the same time, it has been decided to purchase, for the information of British manufacturers, samples of cotton dress goods illustrating the most effective competition that United Kingdom manufacturers are likely to experience in the markets on the Arab side of the Gulf. Samples are desired of those goods (of other than British manufacture) which command a ready sale, and Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe is authorised to incur an expenditure for their purchase up to a maximum of £3, to include cost of transmission and incidental expenses. It is of course important that the samples obtained should be from new stock.r 4. Great importance is attached by British Manufacturers ^ to receiving information regarding such samples which will enable them to compete with foreign manufacturers. To enable steps to be taken by British manufacturers for the purpose of analysing the cloth and forming comparative estimates of costing, samples should be fairly large, i.e. from -J- yard to 1 yard in length, and of full width wherever possible, particularly in the case of prints. Samples should be accompanied by full information regarding the weights, widths, styles, colours and designs in demand locally. 5. Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe is probably aware of the great importance attached by United Kingdom manufacturers to such samples being accompanied by information of the type required to enable them to submit competitive goods. Details such as manufacturers’ prices, should if possible, be given, or at least wholesale price, f.o.b., c.i.f., or delivered and duty paid, and in the latter case the amount of duty levied on each article, should be stated. Attention should also be paid to any of the points under 2 (b) (2) and 2 (b) (3) of the accompanying memorandum which may have special application to the samples.

Under this heading the report should deal with the ^ present scope and importance of the trade, and the extent to which it is supplied by:~ (a) Local production. (b) Imports of British goods. (c) Imports of other foreign goods. (Statistics of imports need not be given where these are known to be available at the Department.) 2. Possibilities ,of an increased British trade . The tv/o main subdivisions under this heading should be:- (a) The possibility of an increase in British imports owing to a general growth in the demand - a factor offering opportunity to all the supplying countries. (b) The possibility of United Kingdom traders securing, at the expense of competitors, a larger share in the existing trade. The points to be covered under (b) may vary with circumstances, but should generally include:- (1) A survey of the trading methods general to the market, e.g. Direct importation f^om manu facturers or indirect importation through merchant firms or other intermediaries; repre sentation by local agents and the basis on which tfre latter work, e.g., on commission or pur chasing; the usual rate of commsssion payable to commission agents should be stated; usual terms of payment; most favoured method of quoting, i.e., c.i.f. destination or f.o.b. port of supplying country, etc. (2) Any special features of the sales methods adopted by the most successful competitors, e.g. representation, service, advertising, etc. (3) Reasons, other than salesmanship, for the popularity of their goods, e.g. quality, price, appeal to local tastes, distinctive packing, etc. 3. Suggestions for popularising British goods. Under this heading should first be stated the degree of willingness shown by United Kingdom exporters to fall in with 2. (b) (1); following which should be given a comparison between British methods and goods and those dealt with under 2. (b) (2) and (3). Finally should be made any suggestions, not already made or implied, as to measures which are deemed likely to make greater appeal to (a) the trader and (b) the buying public. 1.

The report should not, however, conclude without giving some indication of the best methods to be adopted by firms desiring to open up trade relations for the first time. It should be indicated what advantages, if any, are to be secured by individual visit and study of the market; the methods subsequently employed, e.g. direct representation, commission agent, etc. Hints might also be given where customs and tariff regulations are likely to prove troublesome. 6.

Should Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe find it necessary to request other officers to furnish him with information for their districts, it is desired that he collate their reports, together with the information obtained by himself, into one single memorandum. As regards the reports from other officers, in order that the Department may have at their disposal detailed information on the various districts, it is desired that copies should be attached to Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe f s memorandum. 3. The report should deal with the market for motor cars such as are used both privately and for hire purposes, including taxicabs, and for commercial vehicles, such as motor lorries, municipal scavenging vehicles, omnibuses and coaches, and for chassis, parts and accessories. Manufacturers of motor cars and manufacturers of commercial vehicles, however, in the United Kingdom are usually distinct and separate. Moreover, the problems arising with regard to the export of these two classes of vehicles from Great Britain are different in many r espects and consequently it should be borne in mind that statements which apply to one class do not always apply 1 d the other. In the course of the report it may be necessary to bring out these distinctions very definitely and in such a manner as to enable two separate reports to be issued to the two classes of manufacturers wherever this course is advisable.wm r 4. It would be a convenience if the report could be compiled in three sections (l) general matters applicable to both types of vehicles (2) particularly affecting motor cars, and (3) particularly affecting commercial vehicles. Part 1 should be suitable for incorporation in either the report on (2) motor cars, or in the report on (3) commercial vehicles. 5. Reports should be submitted in narrative form suitable for issue to United Kingdom firms, and the form hither to largely used, of question and answer, should be avoided. A list of standard headings is enclosed. It may be followed when applicable and convenient. Statistics, lists of importers and similar information can conveniently be added in the form of appendices. 6. A memorandum is also enclosed on the preparation of such a report, but these notes are not necessarily intended to be exhaustive. Any additional features specially characteristic of the market should be dealt with fully. 7. Catalogues of the motor vehicles selling freely in the market are of interest to United Kingdom firms and should where possible be furnished with the report. 8. In order to minimize any risk of charges of commer cial espionage it has been decided that the fullest discretion should be allowed Lieutenant Colonel Biscoe in regard to the conduct of this enquiry and also with regard to the collection of catalogues.

X Notes on Preparation of Reports on the Market for Motor Cars and Commercial Vehicles. Ire numbers of motor cars and commercial vehicles in use on 31st December last year will indicate the size and comparative importance of the market, while the numbers for previous years will show at what rate the market is expanding. Registrations, by makes, if available, will afford most valuable information regarding the type, price, class and nationality of the vehicles most in use. The ratio of motor cars to population will show to what extent the use of the motor car has developed in the market. Import statistics over a period of years will give a further idea of the value of the market, and if by countries of origin, what percentage is in the hands of British interests. Country of origin is not, of course, always identical with country of manufacture. Import of parts may reveal a trade distinct from that of complete machines or chassis. Export and re-export statistics, if any, will also afford information of value in estimating the possibilities of a particular marke t. An outline of the tariff duties, etc. will enable selling prices to be calculated. Particular note should be made of any preferential rates, or any recent or proposed alterations. Retail prices of locally or foreign made vehicles will be the best indication of the competition to be met. A statement, showing if possible how retail selling prices are made^up^from the ex-factory prices, will not only be interesting but will show through what channels trade is conducted. Note should be made of factory cost,^freight, tariff and landing charges, importers’ and agents’ commission, and. profits to dealers and retailers, etc. ' Questions of credit, instalment selling, supply of stocks, and spares are also of special interest. Distribution geographically may also present its own problems. Any advantage or disadvantage resulting from rates of exchange is of importance in estimating whether competition can be met. Particulars of any local manufacturing or assembling plants should also be noted in this connection. A local industry, while offering competition to the import of complete vehicles, may provide an opening for parts and accessories. If growing and likely to supply local requirements^it may also have an important bearing on the future possibilities of the market. The road policy of any country has also a bearing on the future conditions likely to prevail in any market. The mileage of the roads, by classes if possible, should be given. The/~ 2 ~ The British motor industry is now approaching competition in the Yfcrld’s markets on a price basis, and if any section of the industry such as the manufacture of ,r Baby If cars holding a fair percentage of any market, it will be to have recommendations as to how this share can be increased* On the other hand, if any section has is already interesting materially not yet gained a footing in any market it is of the first importance that ways and means of forcing an entry should oe indicated* An up-to-date list of importers, main distributors, dealers and/or agents whom British firms can approach should be furnished. The commencement and duration of the buying^ season and the best time to send new models to the market should be noted. It will be of interest to know what type or types of vehicles are most in demand, and by whom, and for what purposes they are mostly used, A list of the principal users to whom British manufacturers might send catalogues, etc,, with a view to creating a demand for their goods might be furnished* The names of local British firms suggests itself. The question of advertising in the daily and/or technical press, and the opportunities of exhibiting at local shows might be considered, Karnes of interested Socie'cies and Associations might also be furnished. Features of design considered essential in any market may be of interest, but it should be remembered that it is primarily desired to gauge the market for British, vehicles as manufactured and not for vehicles as they might be made* Modifications within limits are of course possible to suit special market conditions* It should be fully realised at the same time that the range of British motor vehicles is very wide, and that it may be necessary to consider the market for particular classes. ^ In most cases the range is sufficiently extensive to meet all requirements. The system of taxation in the market should be considered' from the point of view of favouring the use of some types of cars more than others. These notes are not by any means exhaustive, and are prepared only as a general guide* Other features, especially those relating to particular markets, will no doubt suggest themselves.COPY (ft 5734/5734/91) Ho,50 0, British Legation Tehran, October 11th, 1930 Sir I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a report from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire deling with the question of smuggling in the Persian Gulf, together with a copy of the letter from the Commercial Secretary referred to therein. 2. Customs statistics are notably unreliable but it is interesting to note that Colonel Biscoe’s information oolnts to an appreciable decrease in the smuggling from the Arab to the Persian side of the Gulf, a traffic which has undoubtedly contributed very largely to the prosperity of the Arab coast in the past. 3. I agree with Colonel Biscoe that it would be advantageous for him to be accompanied by Mr.Probationer Vice Consul Blanch on his forthcoming tour of the Arab ports, and I should be grateful if I might be informed as soon as possible by telegraph whether the suggestion meets with your approval. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade and to the Foreign Seeretaiy to the Government of India. I have, etc., ( 8 d.J R.H.OLIVE The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P. , The Foreign OfficeHMMSNi copy Ho.C.A. 6/IA. Sir, British Legation, Tehran. May 2nd, 1930. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Printed Letter Ho.64/946 enclosing a copy of your despatch Ho. Overseas Trade (b) 4 to the Department of Oversea* Trade, dated 2 nd April last, on the subject of the possible market for British goods on the Arab side of the Gulf. I suggest that it would be useful to know what pro no rtion of the goods shipped to the Arab ports of the Gulf are smuggled into iersia, it being common knowledge that this contraband trade has assumed formidable propor tions in recent years. A study of the imports of these Arab ports during the last six or seven years, so as to include the two years prior to the introduction of the Persian Sugar and Tea Monopoly in May 1926, should give a valuable indication of the rapid increase in smuggling from the Arab to the Persian side of the Gulf. I am unaware, however, whether goods intended for Persian consumption are invariably declared on entry into the Arab ports prior to transhipment. 3. I should also be glad to learn whether in your opinion the prosperity of the Arab side of the Gulf, and therefore its power to purchase British goods, does not very much deoend on the continuance of causes which now make smuggling into Persia so extremely profitable. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, etc., (Sd.) E.R.LINOEMAN. Officer i/c of Commercial Affairs.

Hardly a Tital factor of prosperity, even if it were all smuggled into Persia, which of course it is not. 4. ^K’e nvoy ’itraordlnary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, contraband trade across the Gulf to Persia of recent yoare hut T HRAH.4 4. It must be realised that Bahrein is becoming to an increasing extent the entrepot for He 3d r:nd the greater part of Horth Eastern Arabia, and that this port has lately, for reasons ufoich it is not necessary to enter into here, to a very considerable degree usurped the position formerly held by Kuwait, and a large part of her tea and sugar imports go to supply the needs of the interior of Arabia. This accounts for the increase in sugar and tea imports of recent years, probably more than smuggling. 5 . I n any review of the economic condition of the Arab Coast, the only factor which really need be considered is the Pearl industry, Bahrein alone exports annually some 1-g to 2 million pounds worth of pearls, probably more, since pearls are always undervalued, and in good years the export may actually amount to as much as £ 5 , 000 , 000 . In my opinion smuggling from Bahrein - carried on in the main by Persian merchants - cannot in the light of the facts be considered to constitute more than an unimportant and spasmodic trade, of which the extent is apt to be considerably exaggerated on account of its notorious character and imaginative appeal. 6. While the present moment, owing to the slump in the pearl market, is not particularly opportune for the development of British Trade on the Arab Coast, it is to be hoped that in the ordinary course, conditions will shortly improve and it would seem desirable to carry out a general preliminary survey of the market, so that when the purchasing power of the Arab principalities is regained, British and Indian merchants may be ready to profit by it.7. I would therefore suggest if you see no objection, that Mr.Blanch should accompany me on a tour of the Arab ports which I propose to undertake in the 'Patrick Stewart' about the end of October, lasting approximately 3 weeks or a month. He could collect information from the Political Agents, make personal enquiries from local Indian and British firms and would be more ualified at the end of the tour to reply to trade enquiries from the Department of Overseas Trade etc., and would obtain a wider outlook of trade possi bilities in the Persian Gulf. 8 . As Mr.Blanch will be transported free of charge no additional cost will be involved. 9. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, etc., (Sd.)

Overseas Trade Circular, 34 '7 V A Department of Overseas Trade } 35, Old Queen Street, London, S.WA. 30^ May, 1929. ! 9 I have had under consideration the question of improving the present system oi collecting from abroad and utilizing in the United Kingdom informa tion regarding the activities of foreign competitors, and in particular the com pilation of general market reports and the collection of foreign samples and catalogues, enquiries of this nature having in the past given rise to certain special difficulties. 2 . The whole subject has been carefully reviewed by a Departmental Committee appointed to examine and report upon the work of the Foreign Samples Section of this Department, and to make recommendations concerning the organisation of the collection of foreign samples. As the result of the recommendations of this Committee a new standing Committee, to be known as the Market Investigations Committee, has been set up to supervise and co ordinate the work involved in market investigations abroad, other than those of a strictly limited scope. 3. Certain matters to which the first named Committee have drawn atten tion in their report or about which they have made specific recommendations are of special interest to the Department’s representatives abroad. These are indicated in the paragraphs which follow. 4. Experience has shown that the difficulty of obtaining samples, catalogues, and especially wholesale prices, varies considerably in different countries, and is particularly great when enquiries of this nature are made in the country of manufacture. It has also been found that in some countries there is danger of prejudicing the position of the enquiring officer among the commercial community and consequently his usefulness to the Department. 5. It is thought that the best method of obviating dangers of this character is to leave a large measure of discretion to the officer on the spot to decide whether the enquiries for samples, catalogues and relevant information shall be prose cuted in a particular market, and if so, how. The possibility of procuring information varies very greatly from post to post and while it is not desired to discourage the collection and supply of confidential particulars when these are obtainable without special difficulty, the officer abroad will in future be definitely instructed to limit his enquiries whenever he considers that their prosecution would be likely to provoke objections either from the Government or from the commercial community. 6 . It is appreciated that requests for wholesale prices are particularly liable to give rise to the difficulties named. Nevertheless, it has been decided that in view of the great value to British manufacturers of such information, overseas officers shall still be asked to give an indication of the wholesale price if this can be secured without embarrassment on the score of commercial espionage. 7. The system of market investigations now proposed is based upon the principle that no single section of the Department is in a position to decide upon the best allocation of effort and expenditure, and that this can be effectively achieved only by co-operation between the various sections of the Department which are able to bring special knowledge to bear upon the problem. It is pro posed, further, to extend this principle to its logical conclusion and to enlist also the interest and local knowledge of the overseas officer where possible before an actual plan of campaign is finally adopted. The result of this plan should be the creation of an annual schedule which can be operated in sections so that the work will be suitably spread throughout the year.(4681-9) Wt. 4028—50 1000 5/29 P.St. G.3 8 . A somewhat different procedure will be required to meet the case of specilic applications from individual firms involving enquiries of restricted scope for the purchase of samples, but where no elaborate investigation is needed These applications may be of two kinds :— (a) requests for samples for a special purpose or for the sole i _ the firm; J, (b) requests for market information which in the opinion oi ^ Trade and Geographical Sections concerned can most usefully be with by procuring samples. The latter mode of treatment has not hit! been developed. It has been decided that applications of either the (. (b) type should, in future, receive every encouragement at the hands of the Department, since to deal adequately with requests of this character will be the best method of establishing an effective samples service. 9. You will have observed from this despatch that the basis of the new scheme is co-operation both at home and abroad. The result, it is hoped, will be that requests for reports on these subjects reaching you in future will bear evidence of forethought, and so render easier the task of providing a reply. 10. It is clear that the full procedure outlined above will involve a period of preparation, and it has therefore been decided to bring the new system fully into force in the financial year 1930-31. In the meantime certain requests for samples, catalogues or market investigations are bound to arise, but steps are being taken to ensure that close scrutiny shall be given to the enquiries in the Department itself before issue, and overseas officers may be assured that full consideration will be given to their position in each instance. 11 . I request that you will bring this circular to the attention of Commercial Diplomatic Officers and salaried Consular Officers likely to be entrusted with the collection of foreign samples, foreign catalogues, and ancillary trade information. Copies are enclosed for this purpose. The co-operation of those officers is regarded as essential to the smooth working of the Scheme, and any suggestions which may be received will be carefully considered. I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)— E. F. CROWE.

J p 5^ ^0 Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the possible market for British goods on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf and in particular in Bahrein. In this connection I venture to express the opinion that, although the attention of the Department of Overseas Trade has during 1929 been drawn to this subject, it is perhaps not yet fully appreciated that the Bahrein Islands are becoming in some degree the Emporium of the Persian Gulf. vfnile the trade of Bushire in the year 1927-28 was valued at 23,451,517 that of Bahrein was in 1928-29 in the neighbourhood of 25,000,000. (The actual Customs figures of 23,043,222 contained a declared export of only 2134,392 worth of pearls, whereas it is known that the real value of these exports was in the neighbourhood of 21,500,000 - 22,000,000. 2hit&gt; discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that but few pearls are declared at the customs and these not at their true value)• 2 % in addition the ports of Muscat and Kuwait have a total trade of approximately 21,000,000 per annum. i n ^11 these three areas the sentiments of the population are favourable to British Trade, and the merchants maintain close commercial relations with India, while no exorbitant Customs tariff such as that of Persia exists. It is, in addition, worthy of note that the hhei.dis o^ Bahrein and Kuwait have prohibited the entry of Russian steamers into their ports. rfhe prospects of increasing British trade are The Secretary of btate for Foreign ° in the Department of Overseas irade, 35, Old *ueen Street, therefore/ T.»v'W'l nvytherefore, I think, greater oh the iirah than on the Persian side of the Persian Gulf, where legislative restrictions, a depreciated currency, Hussian competition and vexatious taxes of various kinds hamper the importer. 5 . i should,theref ore, be glad if I might in luture be supplied with 3 copies of such Department of Overseas Trade General Questionnaires as to markets, as you may ■think applicable to these areas in order thd.t I may regularly co-ordinate commercial information from the above- mentioned three offices and in so far as possible carry the Department of Overseas Trade's Export campaign into these subsidiary but growing markets.

Dated the k&amp;th March 1948 * 5&lt;&gt; ' ^ i », QO V\y&gt; ^r\ General Money of the Ministry of Transport has asked nfe^ to V ^supply him with information through the Commonwealth Relations . Office on the following points: C^G (a) the present state of trade in^^e. t (^ujlf, H(M( (b) how much is catered for by British services, (c) whether local British services^nd their agents need to show more energy, /3. (d) what long-term developments seem likely, and (e) whether any Scindia vessels are coming up the Gulf. 2. With regard to (a): Practically speaking, the only exports are (i) oil (ii) pearls (iii) dates and (iv) dried fish. Details of oil shipments are given in reports received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Kuwait Oil Company. Pearls do not call for anything in the way of shipping and in any case their import to India at present is mere or less prohibited. Restrictions imposed by the Government of India on the import of dates from the Batinah by steamer, which may be aimed at the B.I.S.N. Company, have result ed in their being exported almost exclusively by country craft. I am not well acquainted with the details of the dried fish trade but I think certain quantities are exported by steamer from Muscat and Gwadur and that apart from this a good deal is carried in country craft. On the import side it has to be remembered that the population of the Gulf States is very small and that the most important ports i.e. Bahrain, Kuwait and Dubai depend to a great extent on their transit trade. G'oods are re-exported from Banrain to Saudi Arabia (licit), and Persia (partly illicit)from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia (licit) Iraq (illicit) and Persia (illicit) and from Dubai to Persia (mostly illicit) and the interior (licit). At present trade with Bahrain and Kuwait is brisk in imported goods of all descriptions and owing to the ready availability of black market dollars in both these places goods from America and other hard currency countries are being imported in substantial quantities Dubai is suffering from a depression owing to lack of employment locally and the more effective steps that the Persians are at present taking to prevent smuggling. At Muscat all the trade is ir. the haiids of Indians and is at present more or less at a stand-still as there is no local bank and the merchants can only operate on their accounts in India with the express permission of the Reserve Bank of India in each case. 3. The answer to (b) is that excluding oil shipments the bulk of the trade which is not carried by country craft is catered for by British services. 4. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. have greatly increased their staff at Bahrain and the complaints which were rife against them a year or two ago have subsided. They are proposing to locate European staff at Kuwait at an early date. At Muscat their local manager is an Indian and the Political Agent reports that he feels that lack of competition has resulted in a certain lack of energy. The B.I.S.N. Company have now started regular fortnightly calls in each direction by their slow malls to India and these combined with their excellent fast mail service to other ports is I think suffic ient for present needs. Strick Scott boats visit the Gulf ports direct from the U.K. fairly frequently but irregularly. A regular passenger and mail service by Strick Scott boats to and from the U.K. would be a great boon. 5. With regard to (d): Very rapid expansion is taking place at Kuwait owing to the Oil Company's activities and population and /trsdf » • •wmm _ _ 'mm \) 6o i® ^rade are likely to increase. Landing facilities are at present hopelessly inadequate and it is to be hoped that the Shaikh will use a portion of his royalties in improving them. &gt;*ith developments on the aaudi Arabian mainlan&lt;&amp;nd in Qatar, Bahrain is likely to aecline unless steps are taken to provide greatly imporved harbout laCiiities, a hotel etc. A causeway is under construction at Liammam in Saudi Arabia with a railway connecting it with Dhahran P° ss3 ; b ^ Riyadh and when this is completed Bahrain may lose some -oa n 1 ^ ,S trans i t trade with Saudi Arabia. Similarly when ^srOJroleum Development (Qatar) Limited have completed their proposed port on the east coast of the Qatar peninsula imports both for tne oil Company and the local population will ease to come via Bahrain. Developments on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat depend upon the finding of oil in those parts. ra gard to (e): No Scindia vessels are at present comine up the Gull. 1' ^ * am sendin g a copy of this letter to the British Middle East Office.

We are particularly interested in the reference to Cigarette Papers for we handle the Export Sales of the quite well known RJZLA Cigarette Papers. We are wondering if you cam obtain further information on the present position in Kuwait of this business, the article mentions that a demand exists and is likely to continue, whereas our own experience is that we have not shipped ao much as a packet to Kuwait for over twelve months where, we are infomed by our buyers, the market is so heavily overstocked that we have tried to make arrangements to bring back to this country our shipments of early 1947.

PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN --- r^\^/ ^ W r I 3rd May 1947. i From The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. The Secretary of State, Board of Trade, Export Promotion Department, 36, Old Queen Street, London, S.W.l. I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report received from the Political Agent, Muscat, regarding British trade in the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman together with a brief article on the market for British goods in Muscat* 2. Where British firms already have agencies in Bahrain I agree with the Political Agents proposal that Muscat trade should be dealt with through such agencies. Otherwise firms who are interested in obtaining a footing in Muscat might be advised to correspond direct with some of the firms mentioned in the article. 3. With reference to the penultimate paragraph of the Political Agent's letter, commercial directories and books of reference are not only required by the Political Agent, Muscat, but in this office and those of the political Agents, Bahrain and Kuwait, and I should be grateful if I could be supplied accordingly with four copies of any such compila tions as are considered likely to serve the purpose in view. It is believed that SELLS Directory of Exporters would be particularly useful. 4. With regard to the commercial literature supplied by Temple press Limited, it Is understood that this firm is in a position to supply a greater variety of periodicals than are listed in para 3 of the Political Agent's letter and it is suggested that the firm should be asked to forward to this Residency and to the Political Agent*, Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat, a complete list of periodicals available to enable us to indicate which of them we would like to receive. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to the India Office, and enclose a copy mfor the Commercial Relations and Treaties Department of the Board of Trade. Sir, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Resident in the Persian GulfCopy of Express Letter No.C.180-17/11 dated the 5th March 1947 from the Political Agent, Muscat, to the Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain? . Reference your Express Letter No.166-10/20 dated the 24th January, 1947. 2. The United Kingdom^ share in Muscat's imports during the last twelve years has averaged approximately of the whole. Roughly speaking these imports may be classified as spirits and wines, woolen goods, cigarettes and tobacco, soap, perfumes and scent, and cotton plecegoods. In short, with the exception of cotton piecegoods, all are luxury goods. Most of the essentials such as cereals, coffee, spices, sugar, tea, and cotton piecegoods, come from Inaia. Muscat is not a wealthy State and there is little surplus moneyto spend on luxury goods. I am doubtful, therefore, whether the appointment of local agencies for this class of British goods could result in any very considerable Increase in the imports from the United Kingdom. It is to be considered, however, that most of the present agencies for British goods are held either by firms in India or Aden, and in both cases, presumably, supplies to Muscat will be counted against the allotted quotas for these countries. In the former case, the British goods have also to compete with Indian goods for which export licences are more readily available. While in the latter case, communications except by dhow are virtually non-existent. It is clear, therefore, that efforts to increase the united Kingdom's share in Muscat's total imports will not be successful until they are made more readily accessible. While I feel that the value of Muscat trade will not justify the appointment of direct agencies in Muscat, it may well be to the benefit of the British firms to consider re-adjustment of their agencies so as to appoint a central agent for the whole of the Gulf — say at Bahrain — with dealers in less valuable markets such as Muscat. 3. The following commercial literature is received at this Agency. Board of Trade Journal The Motor The Light Car The Commercial Motor Motor Cycling Cycling The Motor Boat The Aeroplane The Motor Ship The oil Engine Light Metals Plastics I l l l l l I I I Supplied by the Temple press Limited, London, by arrange ment with the Board of Trade Export Promotion Department. There is no association or other similar body of merchants at Muscat, and commercial literature received is circulated among them individually. 4. Possible lines of development for British trade are in cotton piecegoods, crockery and cutlery, perfumery, hardware, enamelware, refrigerators, typewriters, sewing machines, paints and varnishes, etc. Literature giving names and addresses of exporters in the United Kingdom, who can supply these articles of import would be useful and could be passed on to the merchants. 5 5.

I now enclose an article on ’’Exports to Kuwait' and hope it will meet the requirements of the Board of Trade. F.a.K. Harrison, Esq., India Office, London./ T A ’ P* THE MARKET FOR BRITISH GuODS IN KUV All 1. Background l ■. Kuwait is an iirab seaport lying betweAi and Iraq at the head of the Persian Gull• It is the natural port for the northern part of Nejd in Central Arabia and is within 80 miles by sea of the Persian Coast. As well as being a seaport Kuwait is the capital and only town of the ^rab Shaikhdom of the same name. The Sheikhdom has a population of between 80 and 120 thousand and an area (mostly desert) of 6,000 square miles. Kuwait grows nothing and manufactures very little. A few score boats visit the pearl-banks between Kuwait and Bahrain in the summer and the pearls they find are the principal export of Kuv/ait other than oil. Small quanti- ♦ ties of •'Persian' 1 lamb skins from Arabia are also exported. With timber imported from South India, sailing ships oi up to 300 tons burden are built and their building and repair constitutes the town's sole industry. The boat- builders are renowned for their skill; and their ships sail as far as Tanganyika and South India, providing Kuwait's next most important occupation — the carrying trade. 'On the outward voyage dates are carried from Basrah and on the return mangrove poles from Africa and from India timber, foodstuffs, tea, sugar and manufactured goods. 2. Political Status Kuwait is an independent Arab Shaikhdom in special treaty relations with Great Britain. These ensure that this small State's external Affairs are conducted exclusively by His Majesty's Government on its behalf and that His Majesty's representative (the political Agent) resides permanently in the State. The rights of British subjects and non-Moslem foreigners are insured by the provision thatcases and suits in which the^ 4 re defendants are heard in the Political Agent*s courtT' Hersiso performs certain consular functions. The present Shaikh of Kuwait is His Highness Sir Ahmed al Jabir as-Subah, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E. Law and order are well maintained under his rule and the figures for crime are remarkably low. Local Demand The local population though small contains a number of wealthy Arab merchants who made enormous profits during the War. In addition the Kuwait Oil Company which has recently gone into production is expanding rapidly and the supply of local labour both skilled and unskilled is not equal to the demand. As a result wages are very high and an ordinary labourer can earn as much as ten shillings a day. All classes therefore have money to spend and there is a great demand for consumer goous. The foreign population is also rising rapidly and there are now about 100 Europeans and Americans and 300 Indians resident in Kuwait. The State is also receiving large sums by way of royalty and beginning to build schools and hospitals. Rapid develop ment on modern lines is to be expected. Both the State and the mercantile community are, anxious to buy British but the latter have been discouraged by the refusal of a number of British firms to deal v/ith them direct instead of through agents located elsewhere in the Middle East. 4. Transit Trade Kuwait is the entreport for the north-eastern part of Saudi ^rabia and the value of exports to that country in 1946 was approximately Es.4,25,000. In addition large numbers of tribesmen from Sauui Arabia and Iraq and mariners from both shores of the Persian Gulf visit Kuwait and purchase their requirements in its bazaar. Owin^ to the /lightlight customs duties in Kuwaijt^ goods are imported for subse lquent export! jtf^arge quaptities of constomer as occasion arises to Iraq and Iran where the t/ariffs are very high. 5. Nature of Demand The following are some of the goods, a demand for which exists and is likely to continue Bicycles Building materials including cement carpets Cigarettes Cigarette paper Cooknng stoves Footwear Lamps Marine engines Matches Motor vehicles and accessories piecegoods- Playing cards Pumps for lifting water Second-hand clothing Toilet preparations Wireless sets The above list is by no means exhaustive. The demand for marine engines is particularly keen in order to '•motorise' the large number of country craft based on Kuwait. 6 . Extent of Demand The total value of imports to Kuwait during 1946 is estimated at over £ 2,500,000 and this figure is likely to rise rapidly with the increasing activities of the oil Company. 7. Inquiries, Banking and Shipping Facilities British exporters wishing to establish trade connections with Kuwait may address enquiries to the Political .agent, or to any of the following leading merchants who ueal with all kinds of imports and exports. 1.

The main correspondents are the Department of Overseas Trade, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The file also contains a number of detailed reports from British officials, which were submitted to the Department of Overseas Trade.The first of these reports, dated 1931, relates specifically to cotton piece-goods, and consists of a general report by the British Vice-Consul at Bushire on the Arab coast market, and reports on local conditions from the Political Agents at Kuwait and Muscat, the Residency Agent, Shargah [Sharjah] (relating to Debai [Dubai] and the Trucial Coast), and the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain. Further general reports on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf by various British Vice-Consuls at Bushire, are dated 1934-37 (including a Department of Overseas Trade published version, for October 1934, folios 126-144). There are also other reports on local conditions, and general correspondence concerning economic conditions and the market for British goods. Papers from 1936 onwards show increasing awareness of the importance of oil in enhancing the potential economic significance of the Gulf states.The following correspondence is also of note:Folios 73-75, dated 1938, draw attention to the increasing market for Indian products and the potentially increasing field of employment for Indians in the Persian Gulf, particularly at Bahrain.Folios 66-69, dated 1942, concern the export of tobacco to the Persian Gulf.Folios 57-64, dated 1946, concern difficulties experienced by merchants in Kuwait in obtaining British goods.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Department of Overseas Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic conditions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
