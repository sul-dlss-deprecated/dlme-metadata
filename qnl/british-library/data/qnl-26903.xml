The Sultan of Lius cat's position as an independent ruler is well described in the Foreign Office letter of the 25 th November 1937 at FZ. 7769/57 , flagged in the collection attached. We have not, of course, any justification Aft, attempting to insist on K.Li.G. acting as an intermediary in the Sultan's foreign relations, and must in general be content to rely on the position which has been built up, whereby the sultan naturally consults us on such important questions as arise. The promise that he gave on his accession that he would be guided by the views of h .h.G. in all important matters, is the only text on which we can base ourselves so long as the Sultan does not pin:sue an actively unfriendly policy. The Political Resident has evidently taken the line that it will be unwise to insist on acting as the channel of communication between the sultan and the Saudi Government in such matters as the present, and fart* may agree with this line. The Foreign Office draft reply to Jedda goes perhaps rather far when it speaks of 'safeguarding the principle (of acting as an intermediary) to which we attach importance' and in the attached draft I have suggested some modification of this.DIu-^T LfcTTLH C .A.F .Duiidas ,Esq •» Foreign Office, S.W.l. 1 0 OCT 1944 Dear Dundas, Itiank you for your letter lie .£ .5554/5534/91 of the 25 th septecaber Muscat of a comnunication from the Sharia Gcurt at Mecca. H.e position of the Sultan of Muscat in regard to his relations with Baggallay’s letter, No.£• 6525 /1C23/91 of 25 th November 1937, Our justification 'for a say in the conduct of LMscat's foreign relations rests perhaps mainly on the premise that the present sultan gave on his accession in 1932, that he would be guided by the views of E.l .G. in all important matters and we agree that transmission to the Sultan of foreign powers was well described in■n it would certainly be a-mistake to raise the issue of our representation of foreign govern ments in ICuscat in connection with this particular incident. As regards the general question of our relations with the Sultan, there would seem no reason to suppose that he is at present likely to deviate far from the policy of relying on our friendly advice and help in important matters affecting his state. With regard to the terms of your proposed j' UrfUd juM. [a (h/foi reply to Jedda, we should prefer to see the principle of our acting as an intermediary with the Sultan in his foreign relations ^stated in l^&gt; —*i..,uii less categorical terms, and/would suggest the following redraft of the last two sentences “The note could then be forwarded, with the Court document as enclosure, to the * lluscat Government through the Political Resident in the Ifersian Gulf as a V /comnun ica t ionconjiiunication. .Tg- s'f^.ula t}'prph 3 r rtiintft4^i the established custom of acting so far as possible as an intermediary with the sultan of Muscat in his conmunications with foreign governments .while the Sultan etc.' F.

On the whole we would prefer to avoid raising the direct issue of British representation of Foreign Q-overnments in Muscat and feel that the procedure suggested in our draft to Jedda would adequately meet this particular incident. We could then save our ammunition for a case where the subject matter is of real importance. Incidentally it seems to us that in view of the independence acquired by other Arab rulers it is getting increasingly difficult to insist on our exercising any real control of the Sultan of Muscat^ foreign policy. Probably a direct attempt to establish this would defeat its own ends and we shall probably have to fall back here, as we have done successfully September,1944. rs (E 5534/5534/91) I enclose copies of Jedda despatch No.84 30tii_JLugu&amp;£ and a draft of our proposed 2 The Sultan of Muscat 1 ^ .present action in in/ F.AJC.

I have the honour to report that in January last I was asked by the Saudi Arabian Government to forward to a Court in Muscat a communication from the Sharia Court at Mecca. I transmitted it to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who has now replied that the Sultan of Muscat lias asked that the case may be referred direct to the Muscat Government by the Saudi Government• 2. I had always been under the impression that under our agreement with the Sultan of Muscat we were responsible for handling his foreign policy; but I have not been able to find any actual instructions on the subject. Moreover I believe that the Muscat and Saudi Governments have never exchanged representatives. I should therefore be grateful for your guidance to the correct method of dealing with such matters.

In principle the Sultan of Muscat is an independent sovereign and Hie Majesty’s Government are not responsible for the conduct of his foreign relations. In practice we have assisted him on many occasions in his relations with various Powers. I am anxious not to raise any question of principle on the present occasion. 3.

Yy'ould you please refer to my confidential demi-official letter No.E.549-N/37, dated the 8th February regarding certain ^ problems pending with the Sultan of Muscat. You will have ik**' received a copy of Eowle T s demi-official letter No.(j/136 of the 3rd March, which, read with my letter of the 8th February, to which it is a reply, gives you some idea of our views on the questiors raised in your demi-official letter No.P.Z.8203/37 of the Ibth January. as however I have not yet sent a formal reply to that letter, I will attempt do so now dealing with it paragraph by paragraph. 2. With the views which you expressed in paragraph 2, the G-overnment of India are in complete agreement and as I have indi cated before, his Excellency takes a considerable personal interest in the development and maintenance of close relations with muscat. 3. as regards the projected visit of his Highness to Italy, we think in agreement with Eowle that it would neither be desira ble nor practicable to attempt to dissuade the Sultan from carrying out this visit, if he wishes to do so. Prom what I saw of him in India, I should think that he has a great deal of determination and that opposition on a point of this kind might only harden his resolve as well as arousing his suspicions. 4. In paragraph 4 you mentioned two matters: (a) the provision of the services of a British Officer as Political Adviser. Some copies of correspondence with Eowle V 1 00 ~ OJ q li on the subject were sent to you under cover of my weekly letter 11^0 No. 26(A)M., dated the 5th March and you will have since received a copy of Powle ! s demi-official letter No.l67-S. of the 10th march in which he has suggested the possibility of , £ u- ** £ &lt; o ° J: i y utilizing G-alloway for this appointment. I enclose herewith a copy of the reply wnich I am sending to Powle and should be grateful if you will let him have a copy on arrival in London, m- 2 - © m case it misses him at Bahrain, as you will see there is no possibility of providing the Sultan with an officer immediately, since we have no one to spare. We are all (with the exception of the Sultan) agreed that Bremner would not he . a suitable selection, but there may of course be difficulty in persuading His Highness to accept any other officer. In the last resort his objections might perhaps be overcome, if we or His Majesty’s G-ovt. are prepared to offer Galloway or some other suitable officer on terms which are financially favourable to the Sultan. This latter idea has not however yet been considered and I nope that it may not arise. (b) The question of the Arms Traffic Subsidy. You suggest that the Sultan should be intormed during his visit to London, if he raises the question, that the matter is al ready under the consideration of the Government of India, ns you will remember the present position is that the Sultan was , told by me in Delhi that if he made an application for restora tion of the subsidy through the Political Resident it would be considered. I have just received Powle’s demi-official to?), letter H o.204-S . of 17th March of which a copy has gone to you. In this is enclosed a copy of a letter from His Highness to Watts hated the 20th Novr. 1937 asking for restoration mainly on the ground of the financial necessities of the State, kowle does not regard finance as a valid argument for restoration and thinks that it could only be justified if the Sultan agrees to give us considerably more control over him and. his State, than we at present exercise, as kowle says this will be a difficult matter and the whole question will of course require careful consideration and consultation bet ween His Majesty’s Govt, and the Government of India. One issue will certainly be raised, viz., by whom the subsidy is to be paid, if it is eventually decided to restore it. I have not yet had time to take the Viceroy’s instructions or to consult other Departments but I feel quite sure that the Government of India will take the strongest objection to accepting „ Jaccepting responsibility for any part of the payment even though they may agree that restoration is desirable. Unless therefore his Majesty T s Govt, are prepared to accept full responsibility for this annual lakh of rupees, in case it is decided to restore the suosidy, it is obviously necessary to avoid at present giving his highness any reason to believe that the subsidy will be restored or cause to reproach us with breach of faith, if the decision is ultimately unfavourable. On the other hand it would be correct now to say that the matter is under consideration and we should have no objection to the Sultan being so informed, if he raises the matter, pro vided you make it clear (a) that the matter is one which concerns not only the Government of India but also his Majesty’s Govt, (b) that no decision has yet been taken. 5. Paragraph 5 of your letter was concerned with arrange ments for jj‘owle and Matts to go to London for the Sultan’s visit. This has nov/ been settled after some rather con fusing telegraphic correspondence. I am sorry about the muddle over Watts. We had heard nothing here of the expedi tion to hhofar, for which Watts was required, and lowie never mentioned it until a stage was reached when we thought that Y«atts had been definitely selected to go home and look after the Sultan. This development therefore came as a shock to us as well as to you. however I have no doubt that Loch will do the job quite adequately and Powie should be able to deal single-handed with any technical discussions that may take place. lours sincerely.

You will reneifber the previous correspondence on the subject which I have again examined. It was agreed between us in 1935 # when we were both at home, that there was no justification for making any further recommenda tion for the continuance of the subsidy. In this connection please see your demi-official letter No.348-S., dated the 7th Hove ber 1935. There was some subsequent correspondence in 1936(vide your demi-official letter Ko*526-S. of 1936, dated the 1st July 1936 to Caroe) in which reference w*s made to the Sultan’s liberation fro., his previous agreement with regard to the arms traffic by reason of the withdrawal of the subsidy. The recent interest shown by both the Japanese and Italians in the ’ersian Gulf might possibly provide a reason for revising the attitude towards this question which you took up in 1935 and 1936. If therefore you like to raise the question of the subsidy without waiting for a direct application from the Sultan, I would certainly have it considered here and it would then be possible to agree with the suggestions made by V.alton in paragraph 4 of his letter. 4.-3- 4.

Should it therefore be decided to accord direct relations with the Foreign Office in name (a course from which the Viceroy would be strongly averse) we should insist on similar procedure being adopted as is now in force for conduct of relations with Afghanistan and Nepal. We trust, however, that it will not be necessary to go so far and that existing arrangements will continue. 4. Above comments are subject to Fowle's views which we have not yet receivedu administrative convenience which in no way affects his international visit to England is concerned. Viceroy attaches, however, great by the Cabinet under which India Office is 'senior partner' on •service, and that initiative in all matters of policy should rest.^r (1) The nev/ Treaty . The Sultan’s proposals, together with the views of the Political Resident, have been received and have been subjected to preliminary examination. But we have not yet had the views of the Government of India and there is not much that we can do until these have been received. ( 2 ) Prolongation o f the 1891 Treaty . All we know is that the Sultan has MMriMHtatap promised to renew the Treaty for another year or until such time as the nev/ Treaty is concluded and ratified, v/hichever is earlier . We need not worry about 'fomal' renewal since it is not unusual for this act to be delayed. *&lt;xU ^ &lt;e&lt;ft TLi* cLU u*t U ru* ** ftwA U\ ^vcvw luxJ tu&gt; Cffa H' ) (3) Services of Colonel Bremner . This is an entirely new suggestion and we cannot do anything until we receive the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident. (4) Services of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Yemenmardi . We do not appear to have any previous information in regard to this matter; in any case the secondment of a subordinate medical officer for service as the Sultan’s private and personal medical attendant is not a question in which this Office is particularly interested. (5)/( 2 ) (5) Sultan^ demand for payment of rent “by Cable &amp; Wireless. Ltd . We have recently consulted the Company in regard to the Sultan’s request. For the right to land cables at a nominal consideration, e.g. for those stations which fall within the control of the Colonial Office an annual fee of £1 per cable is charged, whilst in the case of Aden, Bombay, Karachi and Madras, a licence fee of Rs.10 per annum is payable, irrespective of the number of cables. The Company do not dispute the Sultan’s right to collect fees in respect of the cables landed in his territory and if His Highness would be satisfied with a nominal fee, in the same way as is paid for similar rights in the Dominions, Colonies, etc., they would not object to such payment, but, in return, they would expect His Highness to grant a formal licence covering a period of 25 years. We wrote to the Government of India, by air mail, on the 5th January, suggesting that, if they saw no objection, the Political Resident should be instructed to discuss the matter with the Sultanate Authorities in the light of the viev/s expressed by Cable &amp; Wireless, Ltd. It seems unlikely, however, that anything can be done until the Sultan returns from his world tour, though perhaps the question might with advantage be discussed with him when he comes to England. ruxS&lt;K,:te r ( 6 ) Arrears of rent rrom Gwadur Aerodrome . Arrangements were made for the arrears and rental due up to the end of the existing agreement, i.e. October 1938 to be paid to the Sultan before he left India. other places throughout its system, the Company pays only(8)/ sT~ (7) Exemption from duty of Air Ministry apparatus at Gwadur . We are at present considering this question in consultation with the Air Ministry who wish to secure exemption from customs duty for marine equipment (i.e. launches, buoys, moorings, etc,) imported into Gwadur for use in connection with the Empire Air Mail service. When the question of negotiating a Civil Air Agreement with the Sultan was first broached His Highness offered, of his ov/n accord, to continue to exempt from payment of customs duty, petrol, oil and stores imported for the use of the Royal Air Force and this offer was subsequently embodied in an Exchange of Notes. At the same time he indicated his desire to impose duty on petrol, oil and stores imported for the use of Imperial Airways . He was, however, persuaded to exempt oil and petrol from duty (by the drawback system) and he also agreed that ’’Aircraft and spare parts therefor, aero engines, and spare parts therefor which are required for emergency repairs f should not be liable to duty. These concessions are embodied in Article 15 of the Civil Air Agreement. But it is quite clear that His Highness reserved the right to claim duty on u general stores” imported by ^ Imperial Airways, Ltd., and the Company have just confirmed that generally they pay duty on such items as furniture, refrigerators, paint, etc. In such circumstances it seems obvious that in the absence of any arrangement to the contrary the Sultan can legitimately claim duty on the marine equipment which Imperial Airways wish to import for use in connection with the Air Mail Service and it is for consideration whether we can reasonably expect him to grant exemption on such stores.Air facilities for Gwadur . We are not concerned v/ith this point. Arms Traffic Subsidy . The subsidy of Rs. 1,00,000 per annum was discontinued from 1st January, 1936, 'subject to general examination of the Muscat financial situation in about two years’ time'. (See P.Z.38/36). We must await the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident in regard to this matter. ( 8 ) (9) (10) Purchase of Arms and Ammunition . All we know about this is that last September the Sultan informed the Political Agent that he wished to purchase some 3-Pdr. Naval Hotchkiss guns with ammunition similar to those used by the sloops in the Persian Gulf. It would appear that the Royal Indian Navy might be able to sell some part worn guns and as far as we are av/are enquiries are being made as to supply and cost. Ammunition is not available from R.I.N. stocks. About the same time Vickers-Armstrongs received an enquiry from the Sultan concerning the supply of a Naval 3-pdr. Hotchkiss gun and mounting with 50 rounds of live and 50 rounds of blank ammunition. Vickers asked the Admiralty to supply the outfit from stock for sale to Muscat but we do not know v/hat actually happened. ^ cdnn^L- 0^0 If*. flu Cu+iJ U- soflfaj 7^ &lt; b-clctAS (= *f&gt;Ldr A: OJ-CUIU^. C,c^ tiJl- 1*+^ — 2 ^ U)/(® (11) Reduction of customs duty on frfuscat dates . As a result of representations made by the local political authorities tov/ards the end of 1932, some concession was made in the Tariff value for dates imported from Muscat. (see P.Z.1610/33). But the actual rate of duty was governed by the Ottav/a Agreement and could not apparently be altered, in favour of Muscat. Although the Ottav/a Agreements are still in force negotiations for a new Agreement are now taking place and it is possible that in the new Agreement something might be done to help Muscat. But this is mainly a matter for the Government of India to decide. V/e have some papers (Coll. 30/27) giving the Kalat version of the story in which they complain that goods entering Kalat through Gwadur, though only in transit, have to pay a double duty, first to the Muscat State and then to Kalat. The solution proposed by the Kalat State was to open a port of their own at Jiuni but this had to be dropped ov/ing to the refusal of the B. I. Steam Navigation Company to arrange for their steamers to call at that place. In order to ease the situation f the Political Resident suggested, and the Government of India agreed, that the Sultan should be asked to reduce the duties on Gv/adur transit trade; but when the suggestion v/as put to him (about last May) he stated that he was unwilling to make any reduction in the Gwadur customs dues. In such circumstances the Kalat Authorities can hardly be blamed for their blockade tactics and it looks as though the Sultan must give way in some measure before any compromise can be reached. Here again nothing can be done until v/e receive the views of the Government of India and the local Political Authorities (12) Attitude of Kalat State towards Gwadur. concerneds Sir F. Stewart, I would propose to deal with these matters as in the drafts below.

Fowle home during the Sultan’s stay in England, with a view to taking the opportunity of advancing discussions of the revision of the 1891 Treaty and any other matters which will or may have to be discussed. Sir T. Fowle suggested orally to us the possibility of his deputation for treaty discussions. The draft flagged B deals merely with a question raised by the F.O. as to putting the Sultan in direct relations with the F.O., if he should express The draft flagged A refers to the question of a/a desire for it. It is sincerely to be hoped, for various reasons, that he will not express any such desire, and he has hitherto shown no tendency to do so.

Two at least i of the questions discussed, however, appear to he of considerable importance, viz. the provision of the services of • 99 a British officer as Wazir, and the question of the Arms Traffic subsidy. As regards the first question it seems that it would be desirable^not only as a means of gratifying the Sultan, but also from the point of view of our own interests, to provide him with the services of a British officer to give him 'expert advice in the management of his foreign relations', since this is just the point cUf which it is so important to Qbocrre our influence, Q». andi^ 9 »] which there may be some risk of his breaking away. We therefore greatly hope that it will be possible to lend l • the services of a suitable officer (if not Colonel Bremner then at any rate some other officer) for this purpose. As regards the Arms subsidy we must of course await the examination of the question by the G.of I. If, however, the Sultan should return to this question during his visit to London ^ it v/ould be of advantage if v/e could tell him that the G. of I. already % have it under consideration.

The F.O. letter deals with a s contingency which, it is to be hoped, may not arise. There appears to be nothing in the correspondence which has come to our notice to suggest that the Sultan has so far any thought of requesting to be brought into direct relations with the F.O. 3. There would appear to be several objections to such a development, and | perhaps the strongest is that which is recognised in para. 8 of the F.O. letter, 1 viz .. that it would make it more difficult to maintain our exclusive influence over the Sultan. There is also the possibility that the Sultan, once in direct relations with the F.O., might be the more likely to desire to institute direct diplomatic relations with foreign Powers, which might not necessarily be confined to those with whomhe is already in treaty relationship 6474a Wt 22530/P 144 10,000 9.37 IOP and/* V-.* and which mi ght entail obviously ^ r* undesirable consequences. 4. Though there is at present no indication that the Sultan is likely to raise the question of direct contact with the F.O., it is of course possible that he may do so as a result perhaps of getting new ideas into his head during his tour. In that event it would be a point .for consideration whether he should be put in direct touch with the F.O. for the purposes i only of his visit to England and hi.s entertainment as the guest of H.M.G. Even if this were done, however, it would doubtless be desirable that the 1.0. should be responsible for making the necessary arrangements (with the assistance, it is hoped, of a Political officer from the Persi Gulf) for any business discussions with the Sultan, and that it should be understood that the innovation did not imply any change in the general procedure for conducting relations with Muscat. . 5. Te should be grateful if you, could let us have your views by telegraph. 6.

J. f. WAT,TOT?FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 21st December, 1937 &amp;u\y . _ @ (E 6946/1023/91). ■; PRIVATE AMD CONFID-ITTIAL yt My dear Gibson, I have been asked to discuss with the India Office a question which we think it would be well to consider in good time - what answer should be given to the Sultan of Muscat if he were to indicate before or during his visit to this country in the Soring of 1938 that in his opinion the arrangements for this visit should be made by the Foreign Office instead of by the India Office and generally that his relations with His Majesty f s Government ought to be conducted through the Foreign Office in future? 2. The appalling trouble which we had with the Yemeni delegate to the coronation because he suspected that he was not being treated as the representative of an independent State ought to be treated has perhaps made/ J.P. Gibson, Esq REfllk JK)L 23DE£l837i INDIA OFFICEmade us unduly apprehensive of a repetition of trouble ^ of this kind, even though the trouble would fall in the main upon a department other than ourselves. But the Sultan has been showing a desire to take his own line in so many ways lately that it seems permissible to feel some anxiety lest sooner or later, and possibly on the occasion of his visit, he may seek to establish direct contact with the Foreign Office. 3. You will remember that the legal position of the Sultan of Muscat in regard to His Majesty’s Government has recently been examined in a memorandum PZ. 77 ^ 37 (of the 16th November) by Beckett. This memorandum ) shows that so far as treaty engagements and similar undertakings are concerned His Majesty’s Government have practically no ground, other than a promise given by the Sultan on his accession to be guided by their advice in ’’important affairs”, for maintaining the practical control over the internal and external policy of the State of Muscat which they have exercised by custom during the reigns of the more recent of the Sultan’s predecessors.4. This being so, the practical position is certainly unusual. For instance, His Majesty’s G-overnment would almost certainly he hound in their own interests to defend the Sultan against external aggression, and to some extent against internal disorder. Yet the State of Muscat is not in any technical sense a 'Protected State', much less a 'Protectorate'. Similarly a Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Foreign and Political Department and responsible through the Political Resident to the G-overnment of India and through them (in spite of a certain amount of direct communication) to the Secretary of State for India, resides in Muscat, pays the Sultan an annual subsidy (which might however be regarded as a solatium for the loss of Zanzibar and morally if not legally contractual) and acts generally in a manner scarcely distinguishable from that of the Political Agents in Bahrein and the other Protected States of the Persian G-ulf. Yet the Sultan is in theory an independent Sovereign in treaty relations with other countries besides Great Britain. The/The only concession to the theoretical position is that the Political Agent is also called M His Majesty’s Consur', although the emphasis on his consular status is scarcely perceptible. 5. This arrangement has worked well enough hitherto, and in the Foreign Office we sincerely hope it will go on working. We most emphatically do not want to take over all Muscat affairs just for the fun of the thing and we are opposed to taking any initiative in making a change. But we do feel that it is important that we should make up our minds how to act if the Sultan raises the question himself, possibly at short notice just before or during his official visit. If he does so raise it, we ought to be ready either to yield gracefully or to take a strong line. 6 . As to which course is best, we presumably want the substance and not the shadow. Even as things are we have not got the shadow - i.e. a formal right of control; in fact we have it much less than in the case of Afghanistan before 1919. I mentioned earlier on the Yemeni/Yemeni Prince, whose vagaries certainly afford an awful warning. But strictly speaking a comparison with the Yemen is not a very true one. We do not, even hy custom, control the affairs of the Yemen in any way, and the fact that the Governor of Aden is the channel of communication is due to no other cause than that the King of the Yemen will not receive permanent foreign representatives in his country and has so far taken no steps to establish his own permanent representative in London. I think Afghanistan is a nearer parallel, though not a complete parallel. Until 1919 the Government of India conducted the foreign affairs of Afghanistan, paid a subsidy to the Amir and guaranteed the northern frontier against aggression. The difference from Muscat was that in the case of Afghanistan the undertakings were formal on both sides. After 1919 Afghanistan got rid of this tutelage and as a corollary to entire independence insisted on direct relations not merely with His Majesty^ Government as opposed to the Government of India, but with the Foreign Office as opposed/opposed to the India Office. 7. On the other hand we have the substance - practical control - and as Muscat is a far poorer, less powerful, and less cohesive State even than Afghanistan, we may hope, by adroitness and firmness at the right moments, to maintain it. The question is: would a demand for direct relations with the Foreign Office be a good moment for firmness? 8 . If we do make this concession, it would probably be harder than under the present informal arrangements to maintain our exclusive influence over the Sultan. There would be a change of atmosphere and of mind on both sides, the effects of which might be intangible but would be likely to be real. To this extent there is an argument for firmness. 9. Moreover we should, I suppose, be quite justified in telling the Sultan that without our moral and material support he could never have maintained himself on his throne in his early days, and would not maintain himself for long at the present time: thatthis is true 'both as regards his own unruly subjects and the shadow of Ihn Saud; that the Muscat State has been kept going to a large extent by the subsidy paid by the Government of India, that trade between Muscat and India is predominant and that as for a variety of reasons it would be exceedingly inconvenient to make a change, he ought, as a practical man, to acquiesce in the present arrangement. 10. But although these may be arguments for expecting some degree of gratitude and submission on the part of the Sultan and possibly for the maintenance of existing local arrangements, they are not really arguments against the Sultan’s being in direct relations with His Majesty’s Government and with the department of His Majesty’s Government that deals with foreign countries. As to the first point, direct relations with His Majesty’s Government - this is slightly theoretical, as no one denies that he is in such relations already. It is the second that is or would be the real issue.n, 11. As regards the positive arguments for making a concession, it seems to me that the isolation of Muscat, like the rest of Arabia, is likely (short of major international catastrophes) to grow less and less as the years pass; the Sultan is young, there is no reason as yet to apprehend his death or a period of chaos following on his death, and generally his opportunities for real relations with other countries are likely to increase rapidly as the years pass. Concurrently, the likelihood of our being able to take such disciplinary measures as might be necessary to maintain the existing situation and would at the same time be compatible with the Anglo- French Declaration etc., are apt (again in the absence of any major international upheaval) to grow less and less as the years pass, especially in view of the publicity which now beats on every part of the world. In a real emergency the public could and no doubt would be educated up to realising that control of Muscat is of great strategical importance to the Empire. But I doubt if in ordinary times it would feel any interest in a quarrel/■■I I IIquarrel over a question of form, and unless interested it would not afford the degree of at least tacit support which any government wishing to enforce a strong policy would need. 12. It very much looks therefore as if sooner or later we may have to take the plunge and treat the Sultan in all externals as well as in words as if he were as free and independent as the King of Afghanistan: and if a plunge has to he taken sometime there is much to he said for taking it soon and with a good grace. But for the moment we need not concern ourselves with what we ought to do if the question arises in the future, for in that case we can think about the problem at our leisure. It is the possibility that the problem may arise in connexion with the forthcoming visit for which we ought to be ready, at any rate so far as the visit itself is concerned. 13. It is impossible to lay down an exact course of conduct for events which may arise in a variety of different ways. But subject to the views of the India Office,/5S Office, who know much more than we do about the Sultan’s temperament and the extent to waich he can be coerced or cajoled over a really important issue, we are inclined at present to think that if the Sultan asks before or during his visit to this country that the Foreign Office, and not the India Office, should look after him during his visit, we should, if it is evident that he attaches real importance to his request, concede the point without delay and make the most we can of the concession. Such a decision would almost certainly lead of course to his wanting to come under the Foreign Office altogether. 14. I shall be very glad to discuss this question with you at any time. Yours ever,Note of a disoussion held on 17-11-37 between Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary, ^bctemal Affairs Department, and His Hit^hneas the Sultan of Muscat, at which the Political Agent, Muscat, was also present* A number of matters were discussed, the chief of which were as follows : (1) The new Treaty * Secretary explained to the Sultan that though the Crovemment of India were interested in the Treaty in view of the proximity of the two countries, it was really a matter concerning His Majesty's Government, since this and other Treaties had been in the past concluded between Great Britain and the Sultans of Muscat* He wished therefore the Sultan clearly to understand that though the Government of India would sympathetically consider the various proposals put forward by the Sujtan in the Draft Treaty and would give their opinion on them to His Majesty's Government, they could not of course say whether they would be finally acceptable or not. The Sultan said he quite understand the situation. (2) Proloiyattion of 1091 Treaty . As regards the prolongation of the existing Treaty for one year pending the final negotiations and ratification of the new Treaty, Secretary explained to His Highness the impossibility of ^ being able to conclude the new Treaty before February next year when the present one expires and the undesirability of &gt; havii^; a period in which there would be no Treaty between the two countries. His Highness agreed, but asked for some concessions in the terms of the present Treaty. Secretary....3 - 2 - Secretary pointed out that His Majesty's Govern ment had now agreed to the imposition on British subjects of the new Muscat Ifunicipal Tax and previously (in 1934) had permitted the Sultan to raise his Custom Tariffs 9 though he had bound himself by the Treaty not to do so. His Majesty's Govemment had also used their good offices on behalf of the Sultan with the French Republic and with some difficulty persuaded them to modify their rights under their own Treaty in this connection. The Sultan promised that he would agree to prolong the existing Treaty of 1891 for another year or until such time as the new Treaty should have been concluded and rati fied whichever ms less. It was decided that the Political Agent f Muscat, should address a letter to the Sultan informing him of the agreement of His Majesty's Government to this Municipal Tax and the Sultan would then replythat he was willing to prolong the Treaty for one year more on the conditions stated above. (3). Services o f Colonel Bremiiex. The Sultan mentioned that in his interview with His Excellency he had asked for the services of Colonel Bremner of the Indian Political Service to be put at his disposal if possible for employment as ?/azir of the State. Secretary pointed out that the total cost of Colonel Bremner’s services £ Iq would amount approximately to half a lakh of rupees per V annum. The Sultan said he was quite prepared to provide the sum as he was well acquainted with Colonel Bremner and wanted some capable officer to conduct his foreign relations. The Sultan mentioned that he was desirous, if Colonel Brenner's services were made available, of termi nating the contract of Captain Byard at present serving as Comaandant.•••...-3- Commandant of the Muscat Levy Corps. The Sultan stated that ±teogfcKCaptain Byard was perfectly satisfactory so far as the conduct of his work in command of the Levy went, but in view of the amount of his A ;ay (Rs. 1,400 a month) he considered that for that sum he should be able to obtain an officer who was capable of carrying out other important work in the State. He stated he did not consider that Captain Byard was competent to do such work. The Sultan declared that he had not mentioned the matter to Colonel Bremner when he saw him recently. Secretary said he would go into the question of obtaining Colonel Bremner f s services and if this was not possible, to endeavour to obtain some other suitable officer. (4) . Services of Sub-Assistant Surgeon Yemkenmardi . The Sultan asked what the position was as regards his request for the services of this medical officer. He stated he wished for this particular individual to be seconded for service as his private and personal medical attendant, and that he would have nothing to do with affairs of the State. The Sultan said that the final reply he had received from Sir Trenchard Fowle was to the effect that he (Sir T. Fowle) did not consider Dr. Yemkenmardi suitable for any further employment in the State. Secre tary pointed out that as Dr. Yemkenmardi was employed by the Bombay (government he was not in a position to say whether his services could be made available or not, but that he would enquire into the matter. (5) Sultan's demand for payment of Rent bv Cable and Wireless Limited . The Sultan mentioned that he had not received a reply to his letter sent to the Agency some months ago demanding rent for the use of his terri torial waters by Cable and Wireless Limited. The Political Agent-4- ^ at* 4 ^r&gt; K^l U&gt;U&gt; * ^ ,WX&gt;~ ^ ^ tcty^ccJ A UK -0 ^•U^UkXmJ' wuUu. ti^fft*- ft*. ^IU*. Wt Uu.v/ T A x Agent explained that the matter had been referred to the Resident at Bushire who in turn had forwarded it to the 'India Office. Secretary gaid that he had no information on the subject, and in any case it was a matter primarily for His Majesty’s Grovernment to decide. Secretary asked the Sultan incidentally what he considered would be a fair remuneration for the use of his territory. The Suitan said he was quite unable to name any figure, and he wished the principle of the question decided first. (6) Arrears of Rent from Owadur Aerodrome . The Sultan complained that though he had agreed to accept the sum of £ 1,000 per annum for the increased use of the Grwadur aerodrome by Imperial Airways, and that one of the terms of the agreement was that it should have retrospective effect from 1-1-35, at which date the additional services of Imperial Airways took effect, he had not yet received this extra money, and that/the present raeraent (counting up to the end of the present year) a sum of £ 1,500 was due to him, and he asked that the payment should be expedited. Secretary said he would look into the matter. (7) Exemption from duty of Air Ministry apparatus at dwadur . The Sultan complained that various Aircraft apparatus was being sent to Gwadur on which customs duty, it was claimed, was not payable since it was the property of the Air Ministry. The articles consisting chiefly of motor launches, buoys, anchors, searchlights etc., and other apparatus required for the use of aircraft were used almost exclusively by Imperial Airways, and as this was a coniner- cial Company he did not see why these articles should be exempted from customs duty. The relevant clause of the Civil Air Agreement, the Sultan pointed out, made no mention of....* that of the of Air Ministry apparatus being exempt, but onlyZRoyal Air Force and though he had been informed that these departments were one and the same he interpreted this clause aa applying to articles in for the exclusive use of the Royal Air Force. Secretary said it appeared crima facie that the Sultan had some cause for complaint, and suggested that the Sultan should write in to the Political Agent who he would forward the representation to the proper authority. (8)- Air Facilities for G-wadur . The Political Agent mentioned that he was anxious that the Sultan should give full authority to his representative during his long coming absence from his capital to authorise various projects contemplated by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways at Glwadur in connection with the new services of flying boats to be inaugurated, so that if a request was made for various housing quarters to be erected, apparatus to be installed, and other essential work to be carried out during the Sultan’s absenee when it would be impossible to get into touch with him, his Representative should have full authority to give the necessary permission. The Sultan promised that he would take steps to see that specific authority for this purpose was given to his Representative. (9). Arms Traffic Subsidy . The Sultan referred to his desire which he had mentioned he stated at his interview with His Excellency of being granted a resumption of the Arms Subsidy. He said at the present time there was 'a lack of rupees' in his State and though its financial condition was just solvent, there were insufficient, funds to carry out the numerous measures required for its improvement and progress. Secretary pointed out that the Arms Traffic subsidy was originally granted to the Sultan’s grandfather as a personal concession to compensate him for any losses he may have incurred on assisting the British G-overnment to suppress the Arms Traffic. Secretary,...Secretary asked the Sultan if the Arras Warehouse in Muscat was still in use. The Sultan replied that since his father and himself had forbidden traffic in arms, impor ters had given up using the Warehouse, but that if he removed the restriction, he thought they would speedily resume trade in these articles. Secretary told the Sultan if he desired a resumption of the Arras Subsidy, he should apply formally through the usual channels stating the grounds on which he asked for it. Y/hen the application was received, the question then would be considered by the G-overnment of India. (10). Purchase of Arms and ammunition . The Sultan stated that he was desirous of purchasing sorae arras and aiwnunition for his State from the G-overnment of India. Owing however to H lack of rupees” he wanted to know whether he could have ’easy terms’ and pay in instalments. Secretary replied that if the Sultan would write in officially mentioning his requirements, his request would be considered. (H) Reduction of Customs Duty on Muscat Dates. The Sultan referred to his request first made at his interview with His Excellency for a reduction on the Duty charged on dates imported into India from Muscat. Secretary said he would go into the question but explained that there were difficulties in the way owing to a number of agreements entered into by the Government of India with various Foreign Powers by which they enjoyed most favoured nation treatment.(12) Attitude of Kalat atate towards (iwadur . The Sultan brought up the question, which he had referr ed to in his interview with H.E*, of what he declared was K the blocade of Grwadur by the Kalat State authorities. He asserted that both travellers and caravans with goods from the interior especially from Persian Baluchistan were being prevented from entering Grwadur. Since it was such caravans who used also to take back goods purchased in Gwadur into the interior, a considerable loss in revenue from customs duty was being suffered by his State. Secretary said that he had no information on this matter but that the action alleged to being carried out by the Kalat State was certainly not being done under instructions from the Grovernment of India. He would however have inquiries made in the case.*. NOTE . f I ■ 7 o n 9 / kJ kJ L- After His Excellency had explained to His Highness that he would like to listen to any matters which His Highness wished to raise, the Sultan opened proceedings by explaining his grievances regarding G-wadur. He said in effect that the Kalat State, by using their geographical position, place what amounted to a blockade upon Gwadur. This place is a small tract of land on the coast of Baluchistan with only a fev/ square miles of territory, but an immense hinterland formed partly of the Kalat State and partly Persian Baluchistan. It has been the practice hitherto for the Sultan to make large income from import duties on goods which come in by sea to Gwadur and are then taken by caravan either into Kalat or into Persian Baluchistan. It is probable, so Major Watts tells me, that the greater portion of the imports into Baluchistan is smuggled without payment of Persian customs duty which makes of course this route a popular one for traders. Goods intended for Kalat have to pay not only the Gwadur import tax but also Kalat import duty which the Kalat Government not unnaturally regard as oppressive. The Kalat State are therefore anxious to develop their own port at Jiuni which is 40 or 50 miles west on the same coast. Their difficulty in doing so lies mainly in the fact that no ocean going steamers call at Jiuni whereas the B.I. Coastal Ships call at Gwadur. The Kalat Government therefore approached the A.G.G. some little time ago asking that pressure might be brought either on the B. I. Steam ship Company to calL at Jiuni or on the Sultan of iiiscat to reduce his import tax for goods intended for consumption in Kalat and the substitution of a transit duty. The first alternative was impracticable /- 2 - 3 impracticable, since the B.I* Steamship Company are not amenable to control by the Government of India and the Sultan when approached on the subject flatly declined to reduce his import tax for the benefit of Kalat, Major Watts tells me that he made enquiries a few days ago on his way from Muscat to Karachi and found that the Kalat State were in fact preventing caravans from coming from Persian Baluchistan through Kalat to Gwadur and were diverting them further north to Pasni. There is, therefore, certainly some truth in the facts which the Sultan stated to Kis Excellency; but his idea that the Kalat State are acting at the instigation of the British Government is entirely incorrect. They appear to be acting solely in their own interests and it is difficult to see what can be done to help the Sultan in this matter. I will, however, have up the papers and if His Excellency wishes will address the A.G-.GJ-. in Baluchistan on the subject, in case some compromise can be effected. But it must be realized that the Sultan himself must give way in some measure before any compromise can be reached. 2. The Sultan next referred to the Treaty negotiations which are at present going on between Major Watts and His Highness with a view to the conclusion of a new Treaty, when the present Treaty of 1891 expires in February 1938. The Sultan wishes to get rid of a number of restrictions on his sovereignty which exist in the old Treaty and particularly to secure complete freedom of action in the matter of the imposition of import tariffs. I have already submitted a note through P.S.V. which explains the present position and I will at my next interview show His Excellency a comparative statement, which has been prepared by the Political Agent, showing the Sultan f s desiderata. His Majesty^ /Majesty f s Government are anxious, if possible, to persuade the Sultan to agree to a prolongation of the existing Treaty for one year in order to give time for the many details of modification to be settled* If such prolongation is not arrar^ed, we shall have no Treaty at all with the Sultan for some months while he is away on his tour of the world, and it is hoped that he will consent to be reasonable in the matter* I propose however as was indicated at today f s interview to discuss the matter with the Sultan in greater detail next week. 3. His Highness then referred to the import duty at present charged upon Muscat dates* This question has not been raised officially within my memory and I am not at all sure that we have any papers on the subject in the office. I will however make enquiries and find out. There was recently a similar request made by the Iraq Government for preferential treatment for their dates in return for some preference which they were prepared to give to Indian and British goods over Japanese imports. So far as I remember, the proposal had to be turned down owing to the restrictions placed upon the Government of India f s freedom of action in this matter by the Treaty rights enjoyed under various Commercial Treaties by various other Nations. Many Nations have at present most-favoured-nation rights with regard to import duties on goods brought into India which makes it extremely difficult to negotiate special concessions to individual countries. It has been held that schemes of Imperial Preference within the empire do not violate such most-favoured-nation rights, but since Muscat is not a part of the British Empire, the difficulty does arise in their case. I will however have the matter examined /examined and will ask the Political Resident to let us have a clearer exposition of what His Highness wants. 4. His Highness then stated that he found himself in considerable difficulty owing to want of expert advice in the management of his foreign relations and suggested that it would be advantageous to him and to us, if he could get the services of a qualified British Officer to assist him. He mentioned the name of Colonel Bremner, who was for two years as Political igent at Liiscat before Major Watts. This again is entirely a new suggestion and one which will require to be treated with some caution. When Maj or Bremner v/as at Muscat, he succeeded in winning the Sultan f s confidence to a considerable extent, but during the last few months of his tenure of the office, partly owing to ill-health and partly to his own peculiar temperament, his relations with Colonel Fowle became extremely bad and he wrote a number of very insubordinate letters to which Colonel Fowle took very just exception. He also protested in immoderate language against Major Watts' appointment, and it would, I feel sure, be quite impossible for him to go back as the Sultan's Adviser, while Colonel Fowle is Political Resident or while Major Watts is Political Agent. I am doubtful whether the position v/ould be any happier if and when Colonel Daly succeeds Major Watts, since the Political Agent would obviously find it extremely difficult to fulfil his responsibilities towards the Sultan and to Government, unless the British Officer advising the Sultan was on cordial terms with him and took all possible steps to safeguard the Political Agent's position. A further difficulty about Colonel Bremner is his seniority. He is at present acting as Second Class Resident on Rs.3,000/- a month and when he reverts to the ordinary time-scale his-5- /iL&gt; ^ —If tore*. *yk+*f *^f***&gt;^r~] * tJv^^ I w~i rif^f f / ‘M, pay will be approximately Rs*2,500/- a month including overseas pay. On Foreign Service, especially in LSuscat he would be entitled to a 20%* increase, or at least would hardly accept the appointment on less and the Sultan would in addition have to pay pension and leave charges to the Government of India which amount approximately to 50% of the pay. Altogether therefore the Sultan could hardly hope to obtain Colonel Bremner f s services for less than half a lakh a year, and if Major Watts* estimate of his character is correct, it is most unlikely that he would be prepared to undertake this expenditure. Colonel Bremner might moreover refuse to go to a place where his health suffered so severely during his tenure of the post of Political Agent. I think therefore that there will be no difficulty in squashing the proposal, unless there are very special reasons for wishing to proceed with it. 5* Lastly His Highness spoke about the arms subsidy of one lakh per annum which he enjoyed on a temporary basis until about a year ago. This subsidy, which was paid entirely by the Government of India nominally in order to prevent the Sultan from conniving at the arms traffic, was personal to His Highness 1 father and could therefore have been stopped when the present Sultan succeeded about two years ago. It was however continued on a temporary basis under considerable protest from the Finance Department and the Political Resident was asked demi-officially to furnish full justification for its continuance. As the result of considerable discussion Colonel Fowle finally gave as his considered opinion that there was no justification whatever for continuing it after December 1935 and it has accordingly ceased. The difficulty of justifying its revival is that arms /aims traffic in the Persian Gulf is practically dead and it is doubtful if the Sultan could revive it unless he obtained very large supplies from Japan or Italy or some other country unfavourably disposed towards us* Equally the Muscat finances have recently improved owing to a contract with the Petroleum Concessions Company for oil % which provides him with a regular income of about Rs,7,000/- a month. Political Resident has reported that his financial position is satisfactory and the only argument which we could use in favour of the restoration of the subsidy would be a general political one that the friendship of the Sultan is of value to us in connection with the facilities which he provides at Gwadur for the Imperial Airways and on the Musca t co ast for the R.A.F. emergency route to Men. He is already in receipt of rent of £1000/- per annum for the aerodrome at Gwadur and when the existing agreement expires in 1938 I understand that he intends to raise the rent, if he can, and also to charge as much rent as he can secure for the use of Gwadur harbour by flying boats. It would probably therefore be unwise to give him any concessions in regard to the arms subsidy until we have him tied under a fresh agreement for air facilities at Gwadur. I suggest that this matter might be discussed in more detail with Major Watts and possibly I also with Mr. Caroe when the latter goes through Delhi towards the end of this month*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000200_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2969</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000200</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2969</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 20/14(4) 'Muscat: General discussions with Sultan during his visit to India and UK in 1937/38'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1937/1944</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-07-06T22:04:31</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (72 folios)</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence concerning conversations held or thought likely to be held between British officials and the Sultan of Muscat, Said bin Taimur [Sa‘īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] during his visits to India and the United Kingdom in 1937-38. The papers include notes on discussions between the Sultan and the Viceroy of India on 16 November 1937 (folios 67-73), between the Sultan and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, Secretary of the External Affairs Department, Government of India, on 17 November 1937 (folios 60-66), and between the Sultan and Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on 6 July 1938 (folios 12-13). These notes were used in preparation for possible subjects of future discussions and responses were prepared, point by point (see folios 37-41 and 49-58). Questions raised include that of the Muscat Arms Subsidy, the Sultan’s intention to visit Italy, the need for a British officer to accompany the Sultan during his visit to the United Kingdom, whether the Sultan will push for closer ties with the Foreign Office, and correct terms of address for the Sultan.Additional correspondence between the Foreign Office and the British Legation in Jedda concerning the Sultan’s direct relations with Saudi Arabia is also included (folios 3-9).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>State visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x000200#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
