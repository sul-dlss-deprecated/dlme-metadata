I am desired to say that the whole question of improving the prospects of the I.M.D. personnel in civil employ consequent on the formation of the I.A.M.C. is still under consideration. The Amy authorities, who control the I.A.M.O. have turoed down the proposal for granting emergency commissions to such of the I.M.D. officers as are found suitable 'by a selection 'board and to allow them to continue in their civil posts# The only course left, which is to improve the salaries of the I.M # D. officers in civil employ, is under active considera tion and it is hoped that orders will issue early.
