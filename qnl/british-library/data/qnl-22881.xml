Lear Baxter, Would you kindly refer to the Foreign Office letter dated 20th January, No. 0.423/697x7 to the French Ambassador and connected correspondence regarding the proposed visit of the French sloop 'L 1 Iberville' to the Persian Gulf. I now enclose a copy of a telegram dated 26th January from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which he raises the possibility of the sloop visiting the Irucial Coast. The reference number of the Foreign Office letter to which he refers is E.4999/i.l49/91. We notice on referring to the papers about the .Bougainville' that Lhe original notification from the French Government was on much the same lines as the notification in the present case, and we feel that there might be a danger of the sloop suddenly deciding to visit the Trucial Coast without further notification, unless some word of warning is given to the French. If you agree, perhaps you would be prepared to follow »Y, Baxter, Esq., Foreign Office, S.W.I.\oH a. up your communication to the French Embassy with a further request that should the vessel wish to call at any place in the Persian Gulf other than Muscat, Bahrein or Koweit, a prior reference should be made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which could conveniently be done through the Political Agent at one of the places mentioned above. It would, no doubt, be convenient to refer to any communication which may have been sent to the French Government on the basis of the Foreign Office letter to the P'aris Embassy dated 22nd August 1935, but we have nothing on our file to show what action, if any, was taken on that letter. As it appears that the visit to the Gulf starts early next month the matter is rather urgent. I am sending a copy of this letter to Seal at the Admiralty. Yours sincerely, (Sr*d.) M. J.

I have the honour to ffer to the correspondence 2. The visit went off in a most friendly way and Contre-Amiral Fernet and his officers were charming. 3. On the afternoon of their arrival (February 19th) I gave an 'Atholl Brose* party for them, the officers of H.I '.S. Fowey and the leading iiluropean and American residents in Bahrain. On the following morning formal calls were exchanged with Contre-Amiral Fernet, and I took him to call upon the Shaikh of Bahrain. 4. The Shaikh returned his call on board, but I regret to say that there was very nearly an accident coming away, as there was some difficulty in disembarking owing to the swell and the 3haikh was only just saved from falling between the launch and the ship. He is not as|0^ 2 • 's;: as agile as he was and is much hampered by his garb and I think that it would be wise to resume the practice of the Shaikh paying return visits at the Agency when it is not perfectly calm weather. 6. Contre-Amirai Fernet and his officers were evidently much impressed by the bearing of tiie Guard of Honour of the Bahrain Police and also by the cleanliness of the town, saying that they wished that they could enforce the same standard of cleanliness in Beyrout• 6. A visit was paid to the Oil Field and there were cocktail parties at the New Camp and on board the H d f Iberville'. There was also a football match at Jufair for the sailors. ?• Cn the evening of the 21st February I gave a small dinner party at which after the usual toasts, I briefly proposed the health of Cortre-Amiral Fernet and the officers rnd men of the 'd*Iberville'• The dinner was followed by a cinema show of local and other topical films. 8. Contre-Amirai Fernet sent the following telegram after sailing on the morning of the 22nd February:- Profendement touches de votre si aimable eccueil a Bahrain nous vous envoyons ainsi qu'A Mrs. Gordon Loch et 4 votre entourage nos plus sineeres remerciments et nos meilleurs souhaits stop Au revoir' ■so that I hope that he a_nd his officers and men really enjoyed themselves• I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.An extract from Aden Intelligence Summary No.523 for the week ending the 2rd February 1937.
