SOVERMJEKT OP INDIA, external Affairs Department. EXPRESS LETTER. From To Foreign, New Delhi. Britconsul, Bushire. NO.F.176-N/42. Dated the ^ 11 May 1942. Compensatiori for war injuries . 4 U Reference your express letter No.C/224, dated the 25th of March 1942. 2. With reference to paragraph 5 of your letter, it should be pointed out that the ?/ar injuries Scheme aims at tfie provision of a minimum amount of relief to be payable without distinction of class but does not provide for compensation. Under Section 4 of p. 23 e-(rthe War Injuries Ordinance 1941, the employer has been relieved of his liability under the workmans Compensation Act, 1923 in respect of H war injuries” and “war service injuries M sustained by his employeesj and Government themselves have accepted responsibility for providing relief. Relief is given on the “higher scale” in respect of war service injuries sustained by UctbtS oivil defence volunteers (see clauses 2 and 14 of the War Injuries Scheme). These volunteers may belong to private civil defence organisations provided they are recognised for the purpose of the scheme by the central or Provincial Government under Schedule 1 of the scheme. 3. The relief even on the higher scale is modest and does not differentiate in favour of highly paid employees as does the workmans Compensation Act. The ^estion of payments by eiployers of additional benefits so as to bring the relief to the level of the workman* s Compensation Act is under consideration and in this connection a copy of a letter addressed to the All-India Organisa tion of Industrial Employee's No .L« 1882, dated the 21st of April 1942, with enclosure, is forwarded for information. The Government of India have reason to believe that a number of Companies have promised to supplement benefits under the war Injuries Scheme but have no official information on this point. \ ^ * t , * 'C&lt; ‘ 4. With reference to paragraph 6 of your letter, the war Injuries Scheme, vide Clause 35 of the Scheme, does not provide for relief in respect of injuries sustained outside British India. Indeed it does not even apply to Indian States. THE ISSUE OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN ATJTH0RE3D. ♦ bd/- G.C.S.Curtis, Additional Deputy Secy, to the Govt, of India.

To Organisa tion only. Subject: - Insurance for .employees against war in.juriQ.^. I am directed to say that a suggestion has been made to Grovernment that it might have a good effect in keeping workers at work in factories, mines, etc. if a oompulsory insurance scheme were instituted, at the cost of employers in industry and to be administered by Government with the objept of increas ing the scale of relief laid down in the ar Injuries Scheme. The War Injuries Scheme is a scheme to provide the minimum a/nount of relief to cover the cases of all classes of the popu lation. It is not a scheme of compensation but a scheme of relief. Under the proposed insurance scheme relief under War Injuries Scheme will oe supplemented so as to bring the total relief tip to approximately the scale of compensation under the WorkmenCompensation Act. The scheme will apply Qomp ulBorily to employees m factories registered under the Factories Act,L and to labour in public utility companies, Tramway companies and ports, premium being payable by the employers. A tentative outline of the scheme is given in the annex to this letter. 2. The Government of India are considering the question of suitable machinery for operating the scheme: and they hope that some suitable machinery may be found. As however if the scheme is to be initiated it is advisable that this should be done as soon as possible. I am to request that your Organisation - Federation would let Government know whether (if suitable machinery for operating the scheme is found) they would welcome the introducp- tion of Lhe scheme and whether they have any su^estions for its improvement. * 5. The Government of India have gladly noted that your Organisation has suggested ( vide vour letter No.I.E.87, dated the 7th Ipril 1942) A*o its members to supplement the /ar Injuries Relief generously by compensation. The scheme now put forward by the Government of India will have the added advan* tage of spreading the risk* of extra condensation. mmnsji- Scheme of compulsory insurance for Employees in Factories and Mines. 1. The Scheme will apply only to employees in factories registered under the Factories Act, and to mines falling under the provisions of the Indian Mines Act* but will apply compulsor ily to all such employees throughout British India* and to laoour in public utility companies, tramway companies and ports. Note- A similar scheme might be instituted for well-defined classes of clerical labour sucn as bank-clerks but if so the fund would be kept separate.2 . Necessity fo r the Scheme. The War Injuries Scheme is a Scheme to provide the minimum amount of relief to cover the cases of all classes of the population. It is not a scheme of compensation but a scheme of rcliaf. Many employers may be prepared to underUke the liability of maKing up the figure of Government * relief to a figure equivalent to what their employees would have received had the Vorkmen’s Gompensation Act been applicable. The liability to meet this amount of relief might, however, prove embarrassing to individual factories and an insurance scheme would probably be welcome. It is doubtful, however, whether individual insurance con^anies would be prepared to cover the risk except at high premiums in the case of danger areas. The mist satisfactory solution might therefore be that Government snouid cover the' risk, and should do so by compulsorily spreading the risk over all factories and mines throughout India. 4ny aucn scheme must, however, be a scheme whi&lt;6h would impos no financial liability on Government ah it would not be possible for Government to differentiate between different classes of gainfully occupied persons by granting extra financial benefits to one class only. 3. A uvisabilitv of insti tuting a Scheme. jfimployers in factories and mines are a well defined class who axe anxious in their own interest as well as in the national interest to keep their labour at work. The risk from enemy action is probably greater for those working m factories than for other gainfully enqployed persons, speaking generally. If employers Associations are of the same opinion as the Bombay iillo.\nera that an increase in benefits in the event oi war injury would have material effect in keeping labour at work, it seems anvisable to provide for this, if possioie. 4. 3u. .zested Scheme . earning (a) IX Bnployees snould be divided into groups (e.g. monthly ing under K5.3U, ks.50, Rs.100, ks.200 etc.). (b) A levy of flat rate of so much per head per month for each employee in each group should be levied on all employers and the sums so received should be placed in a central fund. Note. U is intended that initially until experience had been gained the rate should not exceed l?o of the wage oill. (c) From that fund there would be paid to those eiqployees who were injured while actually at work in the factory, # \or when within a specified distance of the iaacbaxy** factories if they had worked in the factory on any of the two days preceding the cate ol injury) fla^t rate sums to each class sufficient to bring the Government relief approximately up to what they would have received unaer Workmen 1 s Condensation Act. (d) Contributions should continue to be payable monthly even after the ^ar until the sum in the fund was found to be sufficient at the close of the War to meet tne obligations on the fund. Contributions if required after the war should be payable by all factories, even those started after tie war, m order to avoid placing any factory at acokparative disadvantage. Note.- As immediately on the close of the v^r the lund would become practically a closed fund, this should not be very difficult to arrange. (e) The Government of India should guarantee jbvances to the fund to enable it to make the necessary payments, but should be entitled to refunds of such advances. (f) Xm If after the war there is a balance in the fund lu 'ml not be appropriated by Government to general revenues cut will be utilised lor the benefit of workers as a whole.k- ^ CONFIDENTIAL.

I understand the Indian Workmen’s Comoensation Act has never been legally applied to Bahrain but that the company have voluntarily agreed to abide by its provisions in resoect • jo Myw /V'—i - of their Indian and Bahraini employees. / I an rei’errns m this paragraph to ordinary circumstances and not particularly to war-time conditions. E. B. Wakefield, Esquire, I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential * Ho.C/727 * Political Agency, Bahrain, the 27th May 1942* To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain* Dear Sir, I have been asked by the Political Resident to let him know what are the Company* s present obligations and liabilities in respect of the payment of compensation for injuries inflicted as a result of war action on its Indian or Bahraini employees* 2. At a discussion held at Awali in March 1942 Mr* Lipp stated that, as things stood at that time, the Company could only pay whatever might be found to be due under the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act. This appears to have been a correct statement of the position since it is in conformity with Clause 7 of the Company* s standard Foreign Service Agreement, which is in turn based on §3(1) of the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act. 3. Under Clause 7 of the Foreign Service Agreement the Company undertakes to pay compensation in all cases of injury ' arising out of and sustained in the course of employment '* and the Indian Workmen*s Compensation Act is to be taken as a guide in assessing the amount of such compensation. 4. The point on which confirmation is now sought relates to the Company’s attitude towards claims made for compensation for injuries sustained, as a result of war action, by Indian or Bahraini employees on the Company’s premises or otherwise engaged on the Company’s business. / ToTo take a concrete instance* An Indian employee is working at the Refinery. An Air Raid occurs. Bombs are dropped. The employee is injured. Such an injury was certainly sustained in the course of employment. Are the Company prepared to agree that the injury also ‘arose out of* the employment, within the meaning of those terms as used both in clause 7 of the Foreign Service Agreement and in §3(1) of the Indian Workmen* s Compensation Act ? 5. The law would hold, I think, that in the circumstan ces described above the injury did ‘arise out of*the employ ment and the Company would be liable for compensation. And I presume that when Mr. Lipp stated that at present the Company could only pay whatever might be found to be due under the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act, he meant that the Company would not be liable to pay compensation for injuries sustained by employees who were, at the time when they were injured, neither on the Company's buairiest nor engaged in the performance of their duties with the Company. 6. Will you please let me know whether this presumption is correct, and whether the Company confirm that their exist ing liability to pay compensation for injuries to Indian and Bahraini employees is not affected by the fact that such injuries may in future be caused by war action.

I am referring the questions relating to compensation for injuries sustained, as a result of war action, hy Indian or Bahreini employees on the Company's premises or otherwise engaged on the Company's 'business to the appropriate officers of the Company, and will communicate with you further on receiving a reply.

Anders on. Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED.Confidential♦ D»Q» No«C/ 807&gt; The Agency, Bahrain, the 13th June 1942• Will you please refer to your confidential demi-official letter No.38a.S dated l*th K.tay 1942, 2. Before I comment on the points raised in para 2 of your letter I will reply to the query made in para 3. 3# The Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act has never legally been applied to Bahrain: Nor would it be quite correct to state that the Company has voluntarily agreed to abide by its provisions in respect of its Indian and Bahraini employees. tfith Indian employees who are not engaged locally the Company enters into a formal contract, called a Foreign Service Agreement, of which I enclose a copy. The Company 1 s liabilities in regard to compen sation for injuries are defined in clause 7 of this contract. The wording of the firet part of clause 7 is baaed on the first part of 3(1) of the Act and the Company would, generally speaking, be liable to pay compensation in all cases in which an employer would under the ^ict, be liable to pay compensation. But the issue whether the Company is or is not liable to pay compensation in any particular case must be determined, not by reference to the Act, but by reference to clause 7 of the Contract. It is only in regard to the amount of compensation to be awarded that the Act is followedj and / and The Hon* ble Lieut.-Colonel v. .H. Hay, C.I.C., Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushireand even in that respect the Company only undertake to be guided by the Act - they do not undertake to be bound by the Act. 4. The machinery for deciding whether compensation is pay able and for assessing the amount to be paid was devised in Feb- f - ruary 1936 and has been in operation ever since. When ever an emoloyee of the Company dies or is seriously injured, and the death or injury appears to have arisen out of or to have been sus tained in the course of his employment, a meeting is convened of the Political Agent, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the Resident Manager of the Connany and the Company* s Chief Local Representative. At this meoting are decided the two questions (a) whether compensation is payable, and (b) if so, how much com pensation should be paid. 5. *ifoat has been stated in paras 3 and 4 applies, strictly speaking, only to foreign Service employees i.e. Indiana engaged Outside Bahrain^rp; Indians engaged locally, and Bahrainis, have no such contractual protection from the Company. But, as a matter of practi # e and without prejudice to their legal position, the Company have in the past treated deaths of, or accidents to, Bahraini or locally engaged Indians in the same way as if the death or injury had occurred to a Foreign Service employee. Reports have been made to the Political Agent, meetings have been convened, and compensation has been granted or refused. Payments of compensation made by the Company in such cages ere, however, regarded by the Company as being ex gratia and not a legal or contractual obligation. 6. I think this exposition is sufficient to answer para 3 of your letter under reply. The issues raised in para 2 of your letter are no less complex. 7. Lipp told us at our meeting in March that, as things stood at that time, the Company could only pay whatever might be found to be due under the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act. Hewas speaking loosely at the time, from his recollection of what had happened at the various 'Compensation Meetings' which he had attended. In any case* I do not think he meant that persons injured as a result of enemy action would automatically be conw pensated on the scale laid down in the Act; what he meant, I think, was that if the Act were applicable to a particular case of injury, whether by enemy action or otherwise, the Company would be liable to pay compensation. Anyhow, whatever Lipp*s meaning was, it was obviously necessary to have the position further clarified, so, after receiving your latter of May 16th, I wrote to T »fard Andersen. A copy of my letter No.C/727 dated 27th May 1942 is enclosed. I followed up ray letter with a verbal suggestion to TJ *ard Anderson that we should meet to dis cuss the situation - a suggestion with which he readily corw curred. 8. At our meeting V?erd Anderson stressed that neither he nor Lipp had authority to commit the Company to any new obliga tions. In regard to Foreign Service employees he agreed that the Company was bound by clause 7 of the contract; but he was not prepared to admit, without advice from New York where legal opinion was obtainable, that a Foreign Service employee would be entitled to compensation if injured as a result of enemy action while engaged on the Company* s work. In regard to Bahrainis and locally engaged Indians he said that the Company had definitely no legal or contractual obligations in regard to payment of compensation, and ho was doubtful -vhether the Company would be willing to assume such obligations. He added that, in practice, and provided cases of death or injury were not very numerous, the Company would no doubt make ex gratia payments in compensation: But the assumption of an obligation to make such payments was a very different matter. Our discussion, though not conclusive in any way, 9 .wss useful in that it enabled me to ascertain exactly what the Company’s present liabilities were* And Ward Anderson promised to refer the whole matter to his Company. He also took note of my suggestion that insurance might well be taken out by the parent Oil Company to cover the employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and associated Companies all over the world. By spreading the risk so widely it should be possible to take out an insurance policy on payment of a reasonable premium. 10. Meanwhile, Ward Anderson asked that a further attemrt should be made by us to answer the questions jpontained in the Company’s letter No.Con 821 dated 26th May 1941 (cony forwarded \ ^ ip* with Agency Memo No.C/532 dated 30th May 1941)t and he has written to me to that effect (vide copy enclosed of Bahrain Petroleum Oom^ •Hb * . pany letter No.Con—62 dated 1st June 1942). 11. I do not see why we should not now reply to the questions asked In the Company’s letter of 26th May 1941. are pressing the Company to assume certain liabilities vis a vis their employees; and it is not unrew sonablo that they should be informed by us whether we accept their views on certain points concerning the existing position. I enclose a draft reply which speaks for itself, and shall be glad to know as soon as possible whether I am authorised to issue it.

The Government of India have def initely recognised in an Ordinance (vide Section 4 of the War Injuries Ordinance 1941) that employers are not liable unaer the Workman*s Compensation Act for injuries caused to their employees by war action and though neither the Act nor the Ordinance apply to Bahrain the principle might be appealed to and you yourself might b€. the Court called upon to decide the question. I think therefore it is rather dangerous for you to make an unqualified pronouncement and I should be inclined to modify the statement by the insertion of some such phrase as 11 so / E.B.Wakefield, Esq.,I.C.S.

Confidential , No.C/1002 . To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear sir » My comments on the points raised in your letter No.Con-821 dated 26th May 1941 are as follows:- I.(i). You assert that the Company cannot assume liability for any British, Indian, Iraqi, Bahraini or other local employees who are injured or killed (a) by enemy action, or (b) by action arising during or from the defence of property against enemy action, or (c) by other acts of war, or (d) by the destruction of property by the Bahrain Government or His Majesty*s Government. In regard to this assertion I would point out that the Company, in respect of employees engaged under the Foreign Service Agreement, has accepted certain liabilities under Clause 7 of that Agreement. It seems therefore, so far as I am able to judge the position at present, that if a Foreign Service employee suffered death or injury as a result of such action as is specified in (a) (b) (c) and (d) above, the Company would, if the death or v • injury could be shewn to have arisen out of and to have been sus tained in the course of the man's employment, be liable to pay compensation. In respect of employees not engaged by the Company under the Foreign Service Agreement, the Company is, in the cir cumstances mentioned above, under no contractual obligation to pay compensation. Whether the Company is under any legal obligation to pay compensation in such circumstances is a matter for the decision of a Court of competent jurisdiction which would decide / onon the merits any oaae brought before It. It may be noted 9 however, that no ceee would lie against the Company under the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act ae that Act has not been legally applied to Bahraini and, generally speaking, a claim against the Company could only succeed If negligence were proved against It. (11) You enquire whether the Bahrain Government or His Majesty's Government will assume responsibility for meeting claims arising out of such action as Is specified In (a) (b) (c) and (d) above. The present position Is that neither His Majesty Government nor the Bahrain Government has accepted any liability In raapsct of such claims. II. The Company's denial of liability or responsibility in res pect of death or injury sustained by employees belonging to the Local Defence Force while training, while protecting the Shaikh's property or when called upon for defensive action by Hia Majesty' Government is noted. III. The Company refuse liability for damage to personal or house hold affects of employees living In Company quarters whan such damage la the result of eneqy action; they also refuse liability for such damage If It arises from any cause other than negligence on their part during rsgular routine operations. These refusals of liability are noted. IV. (1) The Company refuse liability for death or Injury to members of employees' families arising out of (a) energy action, or (b) action arising during or from the defence of property of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. This refusal of liability la noted. (11) The Company enquire who will assume responsibility for masting claims arising from these circumstances, and whether Hie Majesty's Government or the Bahrein Government will entertain them. / TheThe answer is that neither His Majesty's Government nor the Bahrain Government accept responsibility for meeting such claims.

S. Chowdhury to the Protector of Emigrants, and a copy of a letter from the latter to the Company’s Recruiting Agent in Bombay, dated 16th July and 3rd August, 1942, respectively. The Company’s Recruiting Agent forwarded copies of the above here stating that the Protector of Emigrants had advised that he would appreciate any comments the Company would care to make on Dr. Chowdhury’s letter so that he may take these into consideration before making his reply. Chowdhury f s letter, in order of their sequence, I should like to submit the following comments termination Clauses of the Foreign Service Agreement (Clauses 10 to 14 incl.) a copy of which is attached for your ready reference. concealment of Defence Regulation No. 2 from new employees. It was assumed that the Protector of Emigrants was made aware of the regulation when issued and that its existence would be called to the attention of all new emigrants when they signed Foreign Service Agreements to enter the Company’s service in the presence of the Protector. There has been no objection on the part of any new employees arriving in Bahrein to restrictions imposed by the regulation. They have all signed acknowledgments of it without complaint. In respect to the points raised in Dr. (1) The reference in this paragraph is to the (2) The Company knows of no deliberatei? i t3) - 2 ^ H.B.M's Political Agent 25th August. 1942 b-|o5 t.Ow, !■&gt; 10 i' The Company on July 20th forwardedto their Recruiting Agent in Bombay certified copies of your letter No, C/625 dated 8th May 1942 and Defence Regulation No. 2, requested by the Protector of Emigrants, in connection with a complaint made to you by- one Rahmat Ullah, who sent copies of his correspondence to the Protector. In that Defence Regulation No. 2 is now * brought to the attention of all new employees and their acknowledgments obtained prior to their departure from India, there appears to be no necessity of an entry with respect to the same being made in the contract of new employees. (3) The question of Compensation in the event of death or disability resulting from enemy action is being considered by executives of the Company. However, the Company’s action with regard to compensation would, I assume, be determined on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case or cases. (4) You are familiar with the Company’s attitude toward the problem of providing food. They will do anything within reason to forestall or alleviate any local food shortage. They obviously can not, with assured effectiveness, be made responsible for providing food, in view of existing contingencies requiring the issuance of Export License, etc., for which they must rely on various Government Agencies. The Company has no desire and is reluctant to enter into any form of competition with local merchants in the supply of foodstuff for Bahrein. Tankers available to the company are not particularly suitable for shipping foodstuff, especially in large quantities, and their use for such shipments would subject them to delays in the vital matter of oil deliveries. Should the Company, irrespective of the above, be charged with the responisbility of providing food for Indian and Native employees, advance notice of 4 to 6 months would be required for preparation and the supplies would have to be made available and necessary export License granted by the various Government Agencies. It would require that these be forthcoming M- * h r&gt;s Political Agent 25th August, 1942 immediately they are called for to avoid serious delay to vitally important shipping facilities. The Company’s recent experience with orders for foodstuff from India, and other places, does not indicate that this could be expected. Several small orders for foodstuff from India have long been outstanding pending the issuance of proper Export License. (5) The Company are under no contractual obligation to employees’ families who are here at their own risk. Presumably evacuation would be under the direction of Military or Political Authorities and the extent of Company participation would be governed by them. However, when and if evacuation appears necessary or desirable the Company will, in close cooperation with the Political Agent, endeavour with all reasonable means then at their disposal to effect evacuation of employees and their families. (6) In regard to Air Raid protection, the Company have constructed air raid shelters, approved by Military Authorities, throughout the Company’s residential areas and areas of operation where employees are concentrated on duty. Such a shelter was constructed near Dr. Chowdhury’s residence in Awali during June, prior to his letter of July 16th 1942. (7) No comment. (8) No comment.

Ext. 2881/42. INDIA OFFICE, ?THITE HALL, London, S. 7 ^. 1. 28th July, 1942. Dear Syers, The Bahrain Petroleum Company have raised with us the Question of compensation for possible loss or damage to their property at Bahrain by enemy action or by the action of our own military forces (including, of course, 'scorched earth' destruction ordered by the latter). This las led us to consider these questions in relation to the Arab Sheikh doms of the Persian Gulf generally. It seems to us, how ever, that for the time being we need take into account Bahrain and Kuwait only; that is to say, we do not think we need at present consider either the small shaikhdomson the Trucial coast or the Sultanate of Muscat, which has a different status from the others. 2. A s you doubtless know, Bahrain and Kuwait are British protected States in special treaty relations with H.MG., in conseouence of which their foreign affairs are controlled by the latter. -'hey are both regarded as bel ligerents in the present war. Their rulers have repeatedly expressed their loyalty to the British connection and to pur cause; and they have placed considerable f'acilities at the disposal of our Forces, especially the Navy and the R.A.F. 3. The political control which, by virtue of her treaty rights, H.M.O. exercises over these shaikhdoms, is in practice exercised by the Government of India. Mili tarily, however, they lie within the sphere, not of the Oommander-in-Ohief India, but of the Oommancler-in-^hief Middle East, and it is the latter therefore who is respon sible for their defence. We think that this is a factor of cardinal importance in the present connection; since the military authorities on the spot who might cause damage to be inflicted on property or issue orders for destructive measures would be the agents of a military command over which the Government of India has no control. fence it seems to us that the question of compensation for any such damage, whether due to military operations or to the insti tution of a 'scorched earth' policy is one for consideration by H.M.G. rather than the Government of India. 4. The most valuable privately owned property in these shaikhdoms undoubtedly consists of the installations of the Bahrain Petroleum Company (no oil has yet been won in Kuwait, and the Oil Company there is about to plug its wells and suspend its operations for the duration). The Bahrain Company, though owned and controled by Americans, is technically British; and there is no doubt but that in present circumstances its operations are of very great value to the United Nations. As you are probably aware it is now discussing with the Petroleum Department and the ar Office a programme of denial measures in regard to the actual oil wells themselves. 5. At present no scheme of war damage compensation or insurance is in force in either Bahrain or Kuwait. Even if such a scheme were introduced in, or extended to, these shaikhdoms, it could not of course cover the whole field; 'scorching', seizure and other risks incidental to invasion would of necessity be omitted. / 6.

I have received this morning from my people in New York, a cable reading as follows:- 'Hotel 26th. % cable referred to Indian Employees War liability which we do not feel justified in accepting for reasons similar Industries in India are now exempt.

He suggested, however, that the Company might bo liable, under clause 7 of its Foreign Service Agreement, to compensate employees covered by that Agreement who might be killed or injured from causes connected with the war, if the death or injury could be shown to have arisen out of and to have boon sustained in the course of the man's employment. He had already sent the Chief LocaJ. Representative a letter, dried May 27th, in paragraph 6 of/which he asked whether tho Company confirmed this liability. ,/g imagine that it is this latter enquiry which has prompted the cable from New York quoted in your letter. Ify reading of this cable is that your Company wishes to repudiate this liability on the ground tha.t similar Companies in India re exempt from compensating H.R. Ballantync, Esq., Bahrein Petroleum Co, Ltd,, Cliffords Inn, Fleet Street, E.C.i, their/their employees for war injuries. X!e arc not sure to what exemption the Campary is referring; but we think the reference must be to section 4 of the Indian 7/ar Injuries Ordinance 1941, under which employers are relicTfod of their liability to pay compensation or damages, under the workmen's Compensation Act or otherwise, in respect of war injuries sustcoined by their employees. The main purpose of this Ordinance is to provide relief on a modest scale for v/or injuries sustained by all gainfully occupied persons; and the Government of India have had under consideration a scheme whereby employers would bo required to supplement the relief payable under the Ordinance so as to bring it up to the amount payable under the Yforkmen's Compensation Act if it were applicable. f ■ There is also the further point that, although the Government of India, have thus undortaicen to provide relief to a limited extent in certain canes of war injury, industries in India do make a contribution through increased taxation. We do not ieel therefore that your New York Office is quite correct in their assumption that similar companies in India, have been relieved of all responsibility in the matter. The Ordinance does not, of course, apply to Bahrein, nor is there any similar provision in force there for relief in respect /^n of war injuries. In May least, however, the Government of India told us that it might be possible to extend the Ordinance to British Indians injured in Bahrein, Vo arc risking the Government °i India whether they have given further consideration to this matter. ^ You will appreciate that, until we know whether any alternative means arc, or are likely to bo, available for the relief or compensation of your Company's employees, wo are reluctant to comment upon your Company's propose.!^ to a coopt no liability in respect of any war injuries which these employees may sustain. As soon as we have tho Government of India's reply to our enquiry wo will communicate with you regain, and we may then be in a position to give you a more definite? expression of our views. You/ts P&gt;. 5^-N 91 . '9jL&gt; \ You add that in your oi-&gt;inion this denial of responsihility should be extended to all the Company’s employees, including British and Ajacricans* On this point you mny be interested to know that the Political Resident told us in March last that he had ascertained from the Company’s Local Management that. European and American employees (but not members of their families) killed, or totally or permanently disabled while on the Company ’ s premises as a result of war action would be paid double indemnity by the Company, The Political Resident explained that by 'double indemnity' was meant twice the benefits which would ordinarily be paid in accordance with the provisions of the California State Compensation Act in respect to an employee killed or totally or permanently disabled while performing his duties; and that indemnity under this Act was approximately one year’s salary in the event of death.

Dear Wilcox, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.i. (?) 8 December, 1942. Will you please refer to paragraph 3 of my letter *# of October 13th No.Ext.5035/42 (your reference No.S.49764 of September 15th), in which I told you that we were asking the Government of India whether they agreed that the Bahrain Petroleum Company, (and, if necessary, the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait) might be informed that the question of compensation for war damage (including damage inflicted as the result of orders given by our military authorities) must be left for consideration after the war. This enquiry was necessitated by the Treasury’s refusal to agree that Bahrain and Kuwait should be regarded as covered by the statement of post-war intentions set out in Byers’ letter v.o Creasy of April 7tht* The Government of India have now replied that in view of - (a) the treaty position (whereby H.M.G. controls the foreign relations of the two Shaikhdoms), (b) the value derived by the Etapire from their actual and potential oil resources, (c) the free use made of Bahrain and Kuwait territory by British Naval, Military and Air Forces, and (d) the loyalty displayed by both Shaikhdoms throughout the course of the war, they regard it as an unavoidable obligation to achieve for these Shaikhdoms the position reached in respect of war damage in the Colonial Empire, Burma and Newfoundland. At the same time the Government of India state plainly that it is impossible for them to accept the financial responsibility which such a commitment might involve. In support of this they point to the fact (to which I drew attention in paragraph 3 of my letter to Syers No.Ext.2881/42 of July 28th last) that war damage, including ’•scorched earth* destruction, is at least as likely to be caused under the orders of British Military Commanders as by enemy action, and the Government of India have no control over the military authorities concerned and are unable to influence their activities. (Here Mr. Amery would like me to emphasise that measures to prevent the oil from falling into enemy hands would not be taken in the interests of the Government of India, but in the general interest of winning the war). The Government of India point to the further fact that H.M.G. retain control iri* Regard 1 t'o all matters of high policy in the Arab Shaikhdoms and are the final arbiters in all major questions arising therefrom. (I should explain in this connection that the first sentence of paragraph 3 of my letter to Syers quoted above was intended simply to describe the immediate administrative control which is exercised by the C.H.M. Wilcox, Esq., H.M. Treasury, London, S.W.I. **■ not received2 - ■N /\ J the Political authorities who are officers of the Government of India)* The Government of India conclude that since both political and military control thus rest with H.M.G. it is clear that financial responsibility in a matter of this nature should lie with H.M.G*; and they trust that this position will be accepted. 4. The Viceroy, who is taking a personal interest in this question, has telegraphed to our Secretary of State stressing the necessity of establishing the position of the two Shaikhdoms with regard to compensation for war damage on the same basis as the territories already covered by the formula mentioned above. He emphasises that a situation in which Bahrain and Kuwait, which constitute an oil supply of inestimable value from the point of view of the war and as a reserve (a supply which would be still more important were the Germans to reach Abadan,) should be required (a) on our advice to join the Allies and to make available to the Allies their oil production etc.; (b) to face the risk of the destruction of an industry of 'uhe highest value because they have co-operated with the Allies; anc (c) to be informed that they can receive no compensation because H.M.G. under whose instructions and in accordance with whose policy that industry has been destroyed can accept no liability; needs only to be stated for its political (to say nothing of its moral) impossibility to be seen. In his opinion, to treat the Shaikhdoms in this manner would be wholly indefensible, and he would expect the most damaging use to be made of such treatment not only by the Axis but also by our critics in India. He thinks that it may be assumed that the very substantial American oil interests concerned would also make themselves felt. 5. The Secretary of State desires to support most strongly the views expressed by the Viceroy and the Government of Inilia, and he hopes that the Treasury will now be able to agree that the two Shaikhdoms may be officially regarded as covered by the statement of H.M.G.'s intentions with regard to compensation for war damage. 6.

Ext. 5862/4$, of Hovemt&gt;er 19th last, we have now received thre Ciovernment of India 9 s reply to the points which we put to them on the question of the compensation of your Company’s employees in Bahrain for death or injuries arising from the war, and I am therefore in a position to g6ve you some further indication of our views. iour letter of 28th October last contained the text of a cable from your Company which stated in effect that they did not feel justified in accepting liability for paying compensation in respect of war injuries sustained by their Indian employees at Bahrain, on the ground that employers in similar industries in India were exempt from any such liability. But, as the Government of India point out, this argument is not a valid one since, according to their information, neither in the United Kingdom nor in the U.S.A., any more than in India has any liability in respect of war injuries to their employees been placed upon employers, nevertheless your Company have undertaken to pay, in respect of their American and European employees who are killed or totally or permanently disabled as a result of war action while on Company's premises, double the benefits ordinarily payable under the California btate Condensation Act. That being so, it seems difficult to see any justification for any differentiation in the treatment of your Company’s Indian employees, who equally with the United Kingdom and United States employees are serving overseas, and it would appear equitable that in their case your Company should undertake to pay double the compensation which would ordinarily be payable under the Indian Workmen’s Condensation Act. As these Indian employees number little more than 200, while the risks of war injury in Bahrain are now remote, it is hoped that the Company will see its way to accept this proposal, in view of all the circumstances, it is not the intention of the Government of India to extend the War Injuries Ordinance 1941 to British Indians in Bahrain. The Government of India have also informed us that they have recently introduced legislation to provide for a War Injuries insurance Scheme in which, among others, all employers of workers notified under the Essential aervioes (Maintenance) Ordinance, other than the Crown, will be compelled to participate. Such employers will be obliged to pay as compensation for war injury to their workmen*/ the difference between the amount of relief paid by Government under the endian War injuries Scheme and the amount which would have been payable under the xndian Workmen’s Compensation Act if it had been applicable. When therefore this legislation is in operation, it will no longer be the case that employers in similar industries in India /.yk in India are exempt from liability to pay compensation for war injuries# in this connection your Company will doubtless not overlook the fact that the restrictions imposed under Persian Gulf Defence Regulation -No# 2 of 1942 (which of course applies to all British employees of your Company including Indians), while they were dictated by reasons arising out of the war, in fact conferred considerable benefit on the Company since they ensured that at a highly critical period a supply of skilled labour was available for the Company’s operations# With regard to the question of compensation for war injuries to Bahrainis employed by yo^r Company, who are in a difference category from the Indian employees since they are working in their homeland, it is suggested that it should be left to the Government of Bahrain to negotiate with your Company for the provision of such protection for those concerned# lours sincerely, Sd.

Meanwhile I am a little puzzled by your reference to your Company’s suggestion to the Govern ment of India”. Your Company’s undertakings to their European and American employees to pay indemnity as a result of war action were surely given v/ithout consultation with the Govern ment of India, and I hope you did not read my letter of June 26th as implying that we would like to see these undertakings withdrawn. On the contrary, we were hoping that your Company would be ao le to see their way to giving similar undertakings to its Indian employees. do not know whether this legislation has yet been passed, bo far as I am aware, there is no question at present of extending it to Bahrain. We shall be glad to hear further from you when you With regard to the fourth paragraph of your letter, I Yours &amp;c. Sd. R.PEEI. H.H.

Dear Peel I have been a little tardy in dealing with your letter to me of the 28th Junes I v/anted to think about it, and the result of my consideration is the letter I have v/ritten today to my people in New York, a duplicate of which I enclose. Yours &amp; c. H.H.

My delay in writing this letter has been occasioned by a desire thoroughly to consider my advice to you. That advice is The United Kingdom and the United States of rjnerica and, I believe I am right in saying, India, undertake responsibil ities for the death or injury of their Subjects where such death or injury arises from or as a result of enemy action. The Government of India appear to have taken exception to what seems to them to be discrimination by the Company against their British-India Employees in favour of the Company’s United States and Bri tish-European Employees. The Government of India find a difficulty, which I can fully appreciate, in assisting in any such discrimination. It remains, therefore, I think, for the Company to withdraw their generous, if perhaps a trifle misguided, suggestion to the Government of India and to leave all Employees to whatever claims they may have against their respective States. To take this attitude may conceivably remove a little difficulty which the Government of India might labour under as a result of your suggestion. The third paragraph of Mr. Iee 1 *s letter under con sideration would appear to impose a burden upon the Company (in common, of course, with other Employers) to which the Employers might object. I have no knowledge of whether the necessary legislation has been passed, and, if so, what is the present form of it; I will cake enquiries into this if you think it necessaiy. It is not stated whether or not the Indian legisla tion referred to has been or will be extended to Bahrain; if it is, then, in my view, it is a further argument in support of my suggestion above. The implications of the fourth paragraph of Mr. lee 1*8 letter tempt one to enlarge upon the benefit of the continuance of the Company’s operations, not only to the State whose inhabit ants have thereby been saved from destitution, but to the war Effort as a whole. Mr. Peel's last paragraph is one which it is not necessary for me to comment upon. I would like to have your instructions on the formal reply (if any) that is to be made to Mr. Peel in due course. I am, of course, glad that the risk of injury or damage to person or property is now remote from the scene of the Compcny’s operations. In any event, it would be father a pity if this letter from Mr. Peel were to cause any feeling of dissatisfaction in your mind. The principles involved are wide, important and puzzling and incapable, I think, of being thrashed out by letter.ae I have said at the beginning of my letter, I can appreciate fully the attitude of the Government of India and have every sympathy with them in regard to it, and that ie why I have suggested that the Company should withdraw proposals of a discriminatory character, rather than that they should attempt to be generous to everyone.

Correspondents in the file include: the Political Agent at Bahrain (Edward Birkbeck Wakefield); the Chief Local Representative of BAPCO (Ward P Anderson); the BAPCO representative in London (Hamilton R Ballantyne); and the India Office, London (Roland Tennyson Peel).The file includes:discussion throughout 1942 and 1943, between BAPCO and India Office officials, regarding liability for injuries and death caused by enemy action, including compensation and war risk insurance, and the applicability of the India Workmen’s Compensation Act for Injury in Bahrain. The discussion chiefly centres on the status of British Indian subjects employed by BAPCO, and the provision by the Government of India of a war injuries scheme. Included in the discussion is a representation made by an Indian BAPCO employee, dated 16 July 1942 (f 39) which concerns the status of British Indians employed at BAPCO during time of war, and where liability lies for war injuries sustained by British Indians while employed at BAPCO;a copy of a Foreign Service Agreement, used for the employment of emigrants (chiefly from India) at BAPCO (ff 42-44);a copy of booklet, published by the Government of India Press, containing
