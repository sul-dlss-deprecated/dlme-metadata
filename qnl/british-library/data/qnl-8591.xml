In depth details are provided on the concessions that were agreed with Turkey for a tram-road between Belgrade and Constantinople and how similar concessions would be required with Persia for such a scheme to be implemented, but that a larger guarantee would be required for somewhere so far away from Britain in order to persuade bankers and the Public to subscribe to it.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023594369.0x000004#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
