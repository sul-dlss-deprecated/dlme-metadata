Sir, I am directed to refer to the India Office letter No.Ext.917/47, dated the 8 th May 1947, and to say that the Government of ^India agree to the grant of increase, similar to that granted by His Majesty's Government to their staff, in the emoluments of the staff paid for by the Government of India and employ'd at His Majesty's Consulate-General, Ahwaz. It is presumed that the increase now granted is in addition to the conces ions already sanctioned for the staff at Ahwaz, i.e. the increase is over and above the emoluments sho'Vfa in tnc li t forming enclosure to paragraph 2 of Despatch N0.2(05/3/1/4V) , dated 7th January 1947 from His Majesty's Consul-General, Ahwaz, to His Majesty's Ambassador, Tehran. 2.

L l Ft OUGHTS The Rt. 1 on. meat Bavin, His majesty*8 Principal secretary of state for foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, London, 3.W.I.Q°£l Ho. 2 (067VV47) British Consulate-Q 0 n«ral, iV H ii A Z vth Jenary 1947 Sir, The salaries and wages of the members of the staff of this Conaulata-Oanaral have formed Vftw auhjectr Of a number of and, and after a great deal of investigation and enquiry I have come to the conclusion that their complaints are abundantly Justified. I therefore have the honour to submit by this despatch a statement shoving the main arguments and all the relevant information I have been able to collect, in the hope that Your excellency will recomrnend to the Minister of State f s office and the Foreign Office that substantial Increases may be authorised, as from last June. 2. Z enclose a list shoving the actual rates of pay of all members of my staff from the Head Munahi, Mr. Tehran, downwards. It will be seen that a cost of living bonus has been sanctioned amounting to as much as, or more often more than, their basic salary. This bonus was fixed in 1943 to compensate for the high cost of living at that time. It was hoped that that high cost of living would decrease when the war came to an end, but from figures which I shall produce, it will be clear that the opposite has taken place, at any rate in Khuzlstan, and it appears that the cost of living is still rising. whether this is due to the rec nt large cash increases in the salaries of the 40,000 employees of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company, or to more general causes affecting the «foole of the country or the Near East, ia not clear, but of the fact I have no doubt. 3. Before entering Into further detail there are one or two general considerations which apply to all the persons concerned and are perhaps peculiar to Khuaistan. When the 1943 bonuses were fixed it is presumed that account was taken of the actual cash cost of living to each person. But at that time owing to various arrangements made by the army supply authorities of the troops occupying the province, our staff was able to draw rations of x foodstuffs such as meat, flour, vegetables, etc., on payment to the supply officers at very favourable rates. This privilege stopped when the troops left in March 1946. A second point is that it has sometimes been possible to obtain some articles for the staff at reduced prices at the Store of the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Companyt an arrangement which was entirely unofficial and did not amount to very much. That privilege, such as it was, has come to an end: the Company, adhering to a strict interpretation of their concession, now refuses to let any person buy from the st6re who is not a |»mber of the Company. In the third place, the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company as Your Kxcellency is aware, granted very considerable increases of money wages to all their menial staff, and to their clerics and similar employees, as from last June, and, in addition to that, granted the Feralan Government’s interpretation of their rule concerning Friday pay, thereby increasing each employee’s pay, already much higher in cash than it had been up to then, by one-sixth. I do not maintain that similar Increases should automatically be given to all my staff, but in the first place when the principal employer of a province practically doubles the pay of large numbers of working men in the province, many of whom are known to the coneulate staff, the latter /naturally His Excellency, «&gt; • H • -ue I *• ou { eiel, . v.s. 3 .0., M.C., Hla Majesty’s Ambassador,r \ * # - 2 * naturally draw compariaona: and in the second place, as 1 have elsewhere reported, the mere fact of ao much more currency being paid out every month haa a tendency to inflate pricea. The oil employees are also, for the moat part, housed by the company in well-built houaea supplied with water and electric light; whereas ^ our staff have to find their own accommodation, except for the ^ _ _ 1... _ m~m\~ A. 4mmm a 4 Wn okW \M* r* 4* 'l 4 *? V &gt; 4* * e e e e e farrashes, who are fiven quarters but neither water nor light. 4. Taking first the case of the clerical staff, I enclose in the first place a copy of a letter ^ioh they all wrote to me on the 12th July last, which shows clearly their point of view, and also draws attention to the great privilege which the free medical service of the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company represents. The current prices of both driigs and medical attendance are very high. 6* The case of the farrashes and the chauffeurs is even more serious, and some of them complain that they have not enough to eatj and from my personal calculations I have come to the conclusion that a married f err ash with a family must Indeed find it extremely hard to keep his family supplied with the bare requisites of life, even with food. It is certain that they all live in a state of permanent Indebtedness to various tradesmen, who clamour round the Consulate- Oeneral at the end of each month, when the staff are paid, producing bills of food already supplied, so that when they are paid very little remains over for the employee. The Imperial bank of Iran treat their farraahea more liberally than we dot I have found, for instance, that the head farrash of the Ahwas branch of that bank, who entered their service in 1942 and is aged only 24, now receives 1,500 Rials per month, which is a sad contrast to Abbas All, our head farrash, who has grown white-haired in our service, and gets a total sum of Hlals 962*50 per month. 6. Statistics of prices are very difficult to obtain, and all are of doubtful worthj but I append hereto a detailed list of prices at the end of i)eceraber 1946 obtained from my own sources, accompanied by a list of similar prices supplied from quite independent sources by the Anglo-Iranlan Oil Company. Prices for previous months, coming from the same sources, show that the December price level was the highest throughout the yeari I enclose statements from the same sources showing prices at the end of September. 7. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have kindly furnished ©e with a detailed estimate of what they oonaider a normal employee of the artisan class ought to receive per month in Abadan, assuming him to have a wife, three children, and one elderly dependent. I have compared the prices in their 'basket*, as they call it, with those current here, and find that Ahwax prices are slightly higher, perhaps owing to the fact that some of the code mentioned on the company*a list (e.g. su*ar) are issued at a controlled price, representing the actual cost price to the company. I enclose a list of the company*! 'basket* for Abadan, and of the same 'basket' at Ahwass prices. The company include both cloth and housing! in the case of our farraahes both are supplied, but after deducting 500 Rials for those two Items the total 'basket' comes to 204 Tomans per month, i.e. more than twice.what any of our farraahes get. 8. I earnestly hope that all possible steps may be taken with a view to examining this very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The position of the farrashes Is exceptionally difficult. I cannot pretend that any of them have much claim to intellectual eminence, but they are honest and obedient public servants. If their present wage-level persists it is I fear very probable that some of them willCopy il.M.

It is also inconvenient to attend parties for the purpose of obtaining information without returning these parties* Mr. Mehran for instance was compelled to entertain Mr. Mouaavi and one other local official. It cost him about Rials 750/- vlslts from friends on Christmas and Easter or $ou Rous cost approximately Rials 3000/-* These are only examples of extra expense which we are forced to undergo* 7.

I . |Q44 Sece.tr '——- — Dear Miss O&amp;gers, Our conversation of the 10th instant about the staffing of Ahwaz. I attach copies of four telegrams which we have received from Tehran. From these you will see that Colonel Fletcher, with the approval of the Government of India and Sir Reader Bullard, has been granted and has left on leave in this country. Tehran telegram No. 900 raises a wider point, the staffing of Ahwaz from^the Foreign Service, and is the first indication, we have had that the Government of India were considering relinquishing this post to us. As you know the Government of India agreed in 1942 to lend an experienced man for the Ahwaz post, which was held first by Majer Macann, then by Colonel ^Galloway and now by Colonel Fletcher. We had assumed that Colonel Fletcher would return to Ahwaz after his leave, and had not therefore considered the question of staffing Ahwaz permanently. Conditions have of course changed since Major Macann 1 s appointment in 1942 but there are still certain advantages in having an Indian Service officer at Ahwaz, and before trying to find a successor to Colonel Fletcher from the Foreign Service, we should be grateful if you would ask Miss Odgers, India Office.

It will be remembered that, in view of Mr. Squire’s appointment as His liajesty’s LUnister at Kabul, Sir R. Bullard and the Foreign Office asked that arrangements should be made for another senior member of the Indian Political Service to succeed him as Additional Counsellor at His Majesty’s Legation Tehran. This request was put to the Viceroy in the Secretary of State's personal telegram No.7346 of April 13th. In his reply No. 988-S- of April l6th the Viceroy offered the choice of three candidates for the post, viz:*- (a) Mr. Skrine - H.M. Consul-General at Meshed; (b) Lieut. Colonel I.Iacann, H.M. Consul-General at Ahwaz; (c) Lieut. Colonel Galloway, Political Adviser under P.A.I.C. too . The Viceroy’s telegram was closely followed by a telegram fl*om Sir R. Bullard No. 434 of April 18th stating that he and Mr. Squire were agreed that the best man to succeed the latter was Lieut. Colonel Macarm. Sir R. Bullard went on to suggest that Lieut.Colonel 2,Iacann’s successor at Ahwaz might be Lieut.Colonel Galloway whose recent illness, however, might make it impossible for him to stand the summer climate at that post. As Sir R. Bullard’s telegram did not mention Mr. Skrine, the Foreign Office told him that the Viceroy had offered this third choice and asked for his views. In his reply (just below) he maintains his preference for Lieut.Colonel Macann. He adds that he is already approaching P. A.I.C. with a view to their releasing Lieut, Colonel Galloway to take up the post of Consul-General at Ahwaz. He contemplates that arrangements should be roade whereby Lieut. Colonel Galloway would remain at Sultanabad for this summer whenever his duties at Ahwaz allow. The Foreign Office think these arrangements somewhat unorthodox, but are prepared to agree to themi'J. J Jf and propose to leave Sir R. Bullard to fix up the details with P. A.I.C. direct. The Foreign Office ask us to inform the Government of India accordingly. The draft which follows is, like the preceding correspondence, a personal telegram from the Secretary of State to the Viceroy. Its terms have been concerted orally with the Foreign Office. As Llr.

Galloway is at present in hospital in Tehran but is willing to accept the post as soon as he is fit which should be in 2 or 3 weeks, provided he can remain at Sultanabad for this Summer whenever his duties at Ahwaz allow. This I recommend both because his health would not permit of his remaining throughout the hot weather in Ahwaz and also because this arrangement might reconcile the army to his withdrawal. Sultanabad is 18 hours by rail from Ahwaz and has facilities for confidential and rapid comrunication by army signals. Wooller could carry on in Ahwaz pending the arrival of Galloway.K5REIGN OFFICE, S.W.1. 22nd April, 194*3• Dear Monteath, As Peterson is away for a few days, I am replying to your letter to him of the 19th April about the appointment of a successor to Squire at Tehran. The Viceroy has been most generous in offering us a choice of three candidates for this post, and we much appreciate his helpful response to our appeal for another good man to take Squire* s place. You will see from the enclosed telegram that Bullard and Squire have suggested that ILacann, now at Ahwaz, would be the best man for this post. But Bullard does not mention Skrine, and he may have thought that the Government of India would not wish to move him from Meshed. We are therefore consulting Bullard on this point and will write to you again as soon as we have his views. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) C. W.

He considers, end I agree, that the best man to succeed him is Lt.-Col. Macann, His Majesty's Consul-General, Ahwaz. He should be succeeded if possible t)y an Indian Political Officer of similar experience who could keep some control over our agricultural scheme there. Lt.-Col. Galloway, if he could be withdravm from his present post of Political Adviser Paiforce, would be a good selection but he is at present recovering from dysentery and would probably be unable to stand the summer climate in Ahwas. Alternatively, Galloway, though rather junior, could succeed Squire. The only other alternative I can suggest is to appoint Calvert to Ahwaz on his release/Successor to Mr, Squire at Tehran The Viceroy 1 s telegram is very ^^itisfactoiy, and disposes of any fear that i might 'be disposed to let the appointment of Counsellor go and concentrate on an Indian First Secretary* Of his three candidates I should think that Mr. Skrine, who is 55 and has had considerable administrative experience, would be the most suitable, provided that he is persona grata to Sir R. Bullard. Lt* Col. Macann is 45 and is now doing good work at Ahwaz, from which it would probably be a pity to move him. Major Galloway, who was taken from the Political Agenpy at Koweit to act as Political Officer with the Forces in Persia, is 42.

We are inclined to agree with the view apparently suggested by the Viceroy that Skrine, who has the most administrative experience and was Revenue and Judicial Coninissioner in Baluchistan from 1934^*1936 would probably be the most suitable choice, but you will no doubt wish to consult Bullard in the first place.

I have the honour to inform you that I have recently been considering the question of the relationship for the period of the war between the consular posts of AHVAE and KHORRAI.'ISHAHR and any other posts that may be opened in KHUZISTAN. Many questions which are of general interest to the province fail to be decided by the Governor- General at AHtfAZ, and it has seemed to me desirable to recognise this in the relationship between the consular posts affected. 2. In the circumstances it has now been arranged that for matters affecting the province of XHUZISTAN as a whole, and where representations to the Governor-General have to be made, for instance over certain food and supply questions, H.M. Consul at KH0RRA1 BtlAHR will refer to H.LI. Consul-General at AHWAZ direct, rather than to Tehran. He will also deal with H. LI. Consul-General at AH7/AZ, rather than with Tehran, in matters concerning H.Q. Persia Area, which is situated at AN.YAZ. In other matters, e.g. those affecting ABADAN IS.uAND, the port of XH0R1A.M3HAHR, and, generally speaking, anything ’which involved the Central Government he will deal direct with H. M. Legation at Tehran as at present. 3. I propose that the same principles should be applied if and when a consular post is opened at DIZFiJL. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to H.LI.Consul-General at AHNAZ, H.Ii. Consul at KHORRAMSHAHR and to the Government of India. I have, etc. (Sgd. ) R. 17. BULLARD. The Rt. Hon.

I am, Sir, Yc ^ ^ 4 - The Under-Secretary of State,MINUTE In view of the serious wheat shortage in Khuzistan and of the increasing importance of that area, particularly in the matter of supplies, it v/as decided in July, 1942, that a change should be made in British Consular representation at Ahwaz. H.M. Minister xehran suggested that ’’the Government of India be requested to lend experienced member of Political Service. I should like to have Falconer from Kerman •» The Foreign Office supported this suggestion, but the Government of India decided that Major Falconer should be withdrawn to a post in India and offered instead Jajor A.E.H. Macann, then Secretary to the Resident.L^ysore, as Consul at Ahwaz. They described him as having had 2-g- years experience of East Persia and spent roughly years in Kabul, where he acted for 4 months as Charged d*Affaires.

Mr .Eden considers that a career consulate should be opened at Dizful, or some other town, near the headquarters of the 10th Army, which are to be moved to Khorramabad. It is proposed to appoint Mr.H.G.Jakins, at present His Majesty's Consul at Suez,to this post, which, it is hoped he will be available to open in October next 3* Mr .Eden also wishes Isfahan, the re-opening E.8404/2 of the 10th create a post of a to/raise the career vice-consulate at which was sanctioned in Treasury letter mber, 1941 * to a full consulate, and to vice-consul at Shiraz under the superintendence o^/His Majesty's Consul there. 4* It has also become necessary to strengthen the staff at Ahwaz and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran has proposed that an officer should be obtained from the Government of India to take over His Majesty's Consulate there. The Government of India have offered to provide a suitable man with a good knowledge of Persian and Mr .Eden is anxious to accept this offer. Mr.BajiLie, who is at present His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz, would thus be freed for service elsewhere in Persia. 5* In,these circumstances I am to express the hope that Their Lordships will be moved to authorise, subject to the acceptance by the Government of India of a moiety, the expenditure involved in the creation of a full consulate at Dizful, the elevation of the post at Isfahan to a full consulate and the appointment of a career vice- consul at Shiraz. /6 Ihe Secretary to the Treasury. iJ / ^, 1 ^ also explain that the proposed appointment of an oificer of the Indian Political Service at Ahwaz will involve a moiety, of the resultant expenditure devolving on Imperial unds, and, in addition, one half of Lfr.Baillie's remuneration ii-*, pending his definite appointment elsewhere, likewise continue to be a charge on Imperial funds.
