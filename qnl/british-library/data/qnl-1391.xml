Political Department. From, Colonel SIK W. L. MEREWETHER, K. C. S. T. &amp; C. B., Commissioner in Sind. To,, Colonel R. PHAYRE, C, B. Political Superintendent, Upper Sind Frontier. Commissioners Office, Camp Mora, 2§th November 1869. Sir, In acknowledging the receipt of your letter No. 1579, of the Sth instant, I have the honor to call your attention to the following points 1st. The line you propose to adopt for the advanced posts is a con tinuation in a westerly direction of the suggested post from the Punjaub Frontier in the Shum plain. It will be within the Boogtee Hills, will protect to a certain extent and control that tribe, but it places us in no better position for holding in check the Murrees than we possess at present, 2nd. That by placing advanced posts at Beyra and Sungseela, we take upon ourselves new respon.sibilities and establish our troops in a confined country, more unsuited to Cavalry than they are now in, and where they will be separated from their supports by a hilly tract only penetrable by difficult passes, or by crossing a mountain some 3,000 feet above the level of the plain. 13rd. That while it is undoubtedly a most desirable object to civilize the Boogtees and Murrees, and reclaim them from their long existing habits of plunder and inter-tribal sanguinary quarrelling, will the plan 3 T ou propose have that effect beyond the limited extent of enabling the Boogtees to cultivate in peace the small portion of arable land near Deyra and Sungseela, with perhaps a portion of the Morow plain, and to complete the civilizing process?—will it not be necessary to occupy the Murree country as well, establishing posts at Kahun and Kote Moondai, for the protection and management of that tribe also ? 4th. The safety of the Sind border being already amply provided for, will the presence of a post at Phoolajee improve the position as regards the protection of the road taken by merchants coming from Affghanistan( 7 ) throngli Cutchee into Sind or, musfc we depend, as now, on arrange ments to be made by the Khan of Khelat for that purpose : 5th. Can the advanced posts of Deyra, Sungseela and Phoolajee be given from the existing Erontier Force, or will an increase of strength be required, which is pronounced in the 5th part of the 8th para, of Mr. Seton Karr's letter as considered by His Excellency in Council to bo highly undesirable ? Gth. The effect on the power of His Highness the Khan of Khelat which our presence in his country and direct interference with the affairs of a portion of the inhabitants thereof, his subjects, will have. 2. The above points will give you a general idea of the views I hold on the question under consideration, but I will, to explain myself more fully, discuss each separately. 3. 1st—By going into the valley of Deyra we bring ourselves into close contact with the Murrees, who hitherto have been at afar distance, and excepting in concert with the Boogtees have never attempted to interfere with the British possessions. The concert of the Boogtees would be pre vented it is true, but our presence at Deyra would be a constant menace to the Murrees, without our being able to act effectually against them, in conse quence of the hilly and difficult nature of their country. They might if they chose bid us defiance, harass our posts and our protege's, and continue to plunder as they have iiitherto done in Cutchee. To resent and put an end to such a state of affairs, an expedition on a large and expensive scale into the Murree territory would sooner or later be rendered compulsory. 4. 2nd—By occupying Deyra and Sungseela, we accept the new res ponsibilities of protecting the Boogtee tribe from their hereditary enemies, the Murrees, and of insisting on the good behaviour of the Boogtees ; performing in fact the Police duties to that tribe ; any dissatisfied member of which has only to slip into the Murree country to swell the ranks of the unruly there and laugh at our attempts to recover him. This is a situation which I hold would be neither dignified nor satisfactory. The Boogtees no doubt would in the main highly approve of it, as it would certainly be to their benefit. But it would be a false position to place disciplined troops, whether in a strategical or any other point of view. We hold now an admirable line for our Frontier posts ; on the edge of an extensive plain, where Cavalry can act to the best advantage. Should any band of plunderers attempt to enter Sind, they must pass within this line of outposts, and subject themselves to the almost certaint3 r of being intercepted on their return. In 1845 a post was placed at Shahpoor, more to protect the Kyberees, a tribe replaced by up on their own lands at Chuttur, Tahar-ka-Gote, Phoolajee and Koonree, when the Jek- ranees were removed from the same locality by Sir C. Napier, as also, because it was considered a good advanced point from which to check attempts by( 8 ) the Eoogtees to maraud in Sind. In June 1848, however, when experience proved this outpost was unnecessary, and it was found more expedient to have the posts only along the Sind border, it was withdrawn, and detach ments were placed to the eastward of Jacobabad, at Dll Morad-ka-Ghurree, llassan -ka-Ghnrree, Tnngwanee, Kund-Kote, Koomree and Kusmore, with a small party of Belooch guides at M it tree. The post of Belooch guides at Gundooee was added afterwards. This was all sufficient then. Every thing Avas kept safe within this line, and in front was an open plain ex tending for miles, on which Cavalry could act with the greatest ad vantage against any parties of robbers who ventured to leave the hills. In course of time, and owing to the security enjoyed within the line of outposts, cultivation extended outside, and it became necessary to advance. Anew line was ably selected by Sir H. Green, and at his recommendation was adopted. The Kusmore post was taken 4 miles to the north and lessened in strength. The Koomree post was strengthened and advanced 20 miles to Sooee, and admirable position at a point where a river (dry, excepting after rain in the hills, and then only flooded for a few hours) which had always been a favorite way of exit for plunderers, passed out of a low range of hills into the plain. This forms a most complete check to any attempts against Sind. The Kund-Kote post which was located in the thick jungles of Boordika was changed to r ioj, 10 miles to the front, and in the plain outside the jungle, and where cultivation had extended to. The Tungwanee and Hassan-ke-Ghurree posts were changed to Sunree and Goreenaree, respectively, 13 and 11 miles forward and across the plain, and at the southern edge of the low and insignificant range of hills, which lies between the desert tract and the Mutt plain. Dil Moorad had been abandoned as a post some years before. For the protection of the Sind Frontier nothing could be better than this line, and no Boogtees, or Boogtees and Murrees combined, would ever dream of running such a clear risk of capture or destruction, as must be theirs, if they ventured to pass to inside of it. By leaving this and moving into the Deyra valley, we abandon the plain country, go beyond the small range of hills above mentioned, the Mutt plain, and put the high mountain, called the Zeen, between our advanced posts and their nearest supports at Sooee, Sunree and Goreenaree. To reach the Deyra valley, there are only two ways of even tolerable approach from the south for horsemen, viz. by the River Pass at Dooza Khoostuck, or over the Zeen from Gundava by Mund. From Cutchee there are two other means of reaching the valley, one from Phoolajee by the Tejwagh and the ' Suggaree-ke-Ganta, ' a very difficult Pass, quite impracticable for horsemen if defended by only a few men, the road for three miles being only the bed of a water-course, wide enough for but 4 horsemen abreast, with perpendicular cliffs on either side several hundred feet high ; clearing this, there is immediately a most awkward and steep ascent ; afterwards the road is fair enough. The other entrance is by the Ghoree river, a little to the north of Phoolajee. This turns and avoids the ' Suggarec-ke-Ganta,' but has the Murree country on the left flank. Being in the Deyra valley, then we do not prevent the Boogtees and Murrees from plundering in Sind one bit better than we do from our presciit position. Butwe take our troops into worse ground for using successfully sucL as are at our disposal, and we have to afford protection to a wild tribe, which begins to find itself unable to hold its own against its neighbours, the Murrees. 5. 3rd.—With regard to the civilizing process. This undoubtedly is a matter of very great importance, but I question much whether the means proposed will have the desired effect. The extent of arable land at Sungseela and Deyra is not such as to be sufficient for this purpose. Moreover the land is held by the Boogtees under the Khan of Khelat, and all claims in respect to it and its division would have to be settled throuerh His Hi (din ess' Officers. y o o This would be a delicate matter to manacje unless we took the arrangement o o into our own hands, which I gather is in no way intended by Government. As an instance of the diversity of rights likely to be brought forward, I may mention that the Doombkees of Lehree lay claim to a share in the produce of the lands at Sungseela. The Morow plain might be brought under cultivation, but to render the produce secure from the Murrees, a post would be necessary at Keychee-ke-Ghurree, to which there is a very fair road direct from Kahun, the one which was generally used by the Murrees in passing towards the Punjaub Territory. But all these arrangements, supposing them to be perfected, merely provide for the civilizing process as regards the Boogtees. The Mur rees are still left to their own devices and to provide for the cultivation of their lands at Kahun, Moondahee, &amp;c. This they can do now if they choose, for no attempts have ever been made to molest them, either by Boogtees or others. But the life of a border rider, with all its attractions of apparent freedom and perilous adventure, has more charms for them, and until all means of engaging therein are completely closed to them, they will persevere in their old habits and leave chance cultivation as now to the non-combatants of the tribe. The presence of our troops protecting and favoring the Boogtees will excite the jealousy and discontent of the Murrees^ will be a standing war-menace with out helping to overawe them, and if it have any effect on them will, instead of civilizing, cause them to concentrate their power all the more to harass the trade of Central Asia, by making raids on the Kafilahs as they pass through the Bolan and Cutchee, a part of the country which they already among themselves describe as their ' Shikargah' or hunting ground. Unless there fore the Murree country is occupied, as well as the 33oogtee, the civilizing pro cess will be only half completed, while the main object of protecting the trade will be rendered more distant. G. The 4th point refers to the proposed post at Phoolajee. Phoolajee is fifty miles nearly due north of Jacobabad. A detachment here would be in the same line nearly as those at Sungseela and De3 r ra, but it would be of little use to co-operate with the former, the nearest to it, the interval between consisting mainly of ravines, rocks and hills, where a few determined footmen might defy the best Cavalry in the world. If it is intended to prevent the Murrees leaving the hills to attack Kafilahs passing down from Dadur, it would be so far from the part of the country where these attacks are usually( 10 ) made as to be quite useless. The locality called their ' Shikargah'' by the Murrees is the low range of hills near Mittree, known in former years to our army as the ' Chota Bolan,' and from that to Hajee-ke-Shehr, and their line of approach almost always by Mull. To enable the Phoolajee post to act effect ively against a body of plunderers that were known to have left the hills, or of whose attack on a Kafilah in the above locality intelligence had been re ceived, it would have to proceed with all speed to Mull, a distance of 39 miles, to find the enemy had regained the hiJls, for the Murrees knowing the de tachment was at Phoolajee would take care not to risk being intercepted. In your letter I observe you propose leaving the protection of the Mittree and Ilajee-ke-Shehr line of road to the Khelat authorities. This might equally be done without our having a post at Phoolajee. I believe arrangements have been made this season by His Highness the Khan for this purpose, and levies placed by his officers at Lehree, Mull, and Mittree. This is as it should be, and if the scheme is properly carried out by the Khelat authorities, it will en sure all that is required. 7. The 5th point is, can the new posts be given from the existing Force now on the Frontier ? You state in your letter, and in this opinion I quite con cur, that it would not be advisable to withdraw the posts of Kusmore, Soee, Toj, Sunree, and Goreenaree, the new posts then will be so much additional duty imposed on the Force, and will certainly require two Squadrons or frds of a Regiment of Cavalry. Knowing as I well do that the reductions in 1862 brought the Frontier Force to as low a mark as it was possible, and the ne cessity of regular reliefs in such duty as it has to carry out, I question the possibility of the arrangement being made, and shall be glad of a report from you on this point particularly. 8. The Gth point is a very important one, and one which has, I think ) escaped due attention. It has always been, and naturally must ever be as long as the Khan of Khelat remains a free and independent Sovereign, our great object to increase his influence, and strengthen his power within his country as much as we can. To relieve him of constant complaints by us re garding lawless acts committed by certain refractory portions of his subjects would doubtless be in some respect satisfactory, but when that end is only to be gained by so public an acknowledgment of his weakness, one so likely to have the worst effect on the remainder of his subjects, his wisdom in accepting such relief would be most questionable, and for us to recommend it, would be abandoning the policy we know to be right and most sound, the whole subject of the protection of our Western Frontier being taken into consideration. As long as the Khanate of Khelat is in the hands of one person, and that one as at present only desirous to act in accordance with the wishes of the British Government, we need feel no concern about the safety of our Frontier from Korth to South. But once let his powers be destroyed, and the country fall into the hands of a number of petty Chieftains with little control over their followers, then the principle which is proposed for the Boogtee country will hive to be carried out the whole way down to the Sea.( 11 ) 0. In place tlion of supporting the advance now. under discussion, and •\vliicli I certainly consider would be a false move, I should be more disposed to urge earnestly on the Government of India the advisibility of closely scruti nising the position of the kingdom of Khelat, as it aifects us now, and as it will far more a few years hence ; and whether in place of assuming to ourselves a portion of the prerogatives of the Khan, we could not more easily, and at a smaller expenditure so improve his position, as to render all direct interference on our part unnecessary, and ensure our territory remaining thoroughly and completely undisturbed. 10. Presuming it to be allowed that the Northern Frontier of Sind is sufficiently protected by the present line of outposts, (and I gather that is not questioned for a moment,) the sole point left for consideration of the Sind au thorities is the safety of the merchants passing through the Khan of Khelat's territory from Quettah to Sind. Your proposals involve that the Khan of Khelat should be called upon to provide posts to protect the Kafilahs along the line where they are supposed to be liable to attack by the Uill tribes, viz : from Dadur to Phoolajee. Such is all that in reality is required, and our advance to Deyra would not relieve him from this part of the programme. Most willingly would the Khan undertake this and more, were it not that the im poverished state of his finances renders it impossible for him to do so for a con tinuance, or in such an effectual manner as to make a successful result certain. What is needed then is that sufficient funds should be at his disposal to enable him to devote them solely to this purpose. Were these granted, he would not only place posts at the points mentioned, but he would take portions of the Murree and Boogtee tribe into his pay again, as a bond for their good behaviour, and would place officials on behalf of his own Government at Deyra, Kahun, and jVIoondaheCj to see that the conduct of the tribes was such as he demanded. 11. The annual cost of this would not amount to more than 50 or 60,000 Hupees. It would be a most valuable means of supporting and improving the Khan's authority. It would effectually give safety to merchants passing through the country, and above all, it would not involve us in any new complications or entail on us any new responsibilities. Further, it would help materially to wards the civilization of the Murrees and Boogtees. The temptation of the hitherto almost unprotected ' Shikargah' being taken from the former, and the retention in service of levies from their tribe being dependent on their good behaviour, they would, from a sense of self-interest, gradually gave up their old habits and look about for other means of obtaining a livelihood. The Boogtees being restrained by the same powerful bond, would try to live at peace with their neighbours ; and the presence of the Khan's Officers among these tribes would allow of their submitting their grievances to be settled for them, instead( 12 ) of resorting to the old plan of adjustment by hostilities. These tribes, with all their wildness and tetehy nature, have a great respect for authority and es pecially for that of their own rulers. They would themselves prefer and feel more honored by regular payment through their own Government than through any other. X ott .—2fith Jan. 12. If at the same time that this plan was introduced, increased means* 1870. 1 * Gonl .lacoh's ^ irrigating the plain between the Sind Frontier, the Hills, and Cutchee were (''u'lTTvLiiV' pn.- rti ven ' opportunity of peaceful livelihood by cultivation would be afforded to vide this perfectly. members of the Hill tribes, who had a desire that way, and a healthy W. L. M. civilizing process would be initiated, which could not fail to bear good fruit. 13. In the 4th para, of your letter you allude to the old trade route from Hurrund to Khelat. This is not a very important one I think, though it did once hold a name a hundred and odd years ago, when the then Khan of Khelat, the great Nusseer Khan, had possession of Hurrund and Dajul, and his sway was undisputed and dreaded throughout the Murree and Boogtee Hills. Let the Khan's power be so again established, and this trade line would re-open, if required. 14. The above remarks all refer to the question under review simply as it affects the Sind border. I will now discuss it as it affects the neighbouring Frontier of the Punjaub. Under the arrangements I propose, the Murrees and IBoogtees would be equally bound down to respect the British territory and harmless traders on that side as much as on the side of Sind, and for that pur pose the arrangement with them entered into by Captain Sandeman, and which has hitherto answered so well, might be continued, with this difference only that, as it is undoubtedly advisable that all transactions with the subjects of the Khan of Khelat should only be carried on by one responsible person r and that one^ the Officer who has charge of the political relations with the Khan, viz. the Poli tical Superintendent on the Frontier of Sind, it would be best that all payments to the Hill tribes, and all references regarding them, should be made through the Political Superintendent. In the full discussion of all these matters which I for tunately had with Captain Sandeman a few days ago at Hydrabad, and from a let ter since received from him, it appears to me that he himself would advocate this course. Such being the case, the matter could easily be arranged between you. 15. With regard to placing a post in the Shum plain, to which Captain Sandeman attaches great importance, I see no reason why it should not be done to strengthen that Frontier line. The objections against the Deyra plan do not exist in this case. From what Captain Sandeman said, I understood that the proposed post would be only about 12, at the furthest 15 miles, in advance of the existing Frontier posts, close therefore to its supports, and that there was easy inter-communication between these points, the road being good and( 13 ) tlirough no difficult Pass. Advancing so far, would take in no new tribe or involve the 1'uujaub troops in any way with the Hill people. It would 'ive additional power of interception of any bodies breaking the peace, and so reduce the temptation to ■them to do so. It would be in fact mere'lv estab lishing on the Punjaub side a similar post to the Sind one at Sooee. It could ■•ilso be placed there without it being necessary to bave posts from Sind at Deyra and Suug'seela. 1 fi. The occupation of Barkhan (Lugbaree) is a question which I do not fee competent to discuss, having only a very general knowledge of that part oi the country. Captain Sandemanurges it, because it will enable thcauthori- res at Deyra Ghazee Khan to include a minor branch of the Lugharee tribe, ' 1 1S nOW outside 0U1, boundary and which occasionally gives trouble from icing lev ond direct control. Captain Sandeman is the best judge of the neces sity ol this part of the plan, as also of how far it will involve us with other tnbes. The country is beyond the limits of Khelat territory, and this point may be left to his greater experience of those parts for elaboration, while his opinion will deservedly have greatest weight. 17, In conclusion, I have only to add that, while clearly of opinion that the occupation of the advanced line from Sind would be a grave mistake, I am strongly in favor of the trip through the hills being carried out, as desired bv the Supreme Government. By means of it, the Officers of both lines of Frontier will he brought together and become personally acquainted, to the advantage of uture cordial cooperation, and they will gain useful knowledge of the country and Its inhabitants; at the same time the latter will see that we can move about among their lulls, and they will learn a useful lesson in watching the move- mcnts ol disciplined troops, and the power that accompanies orderly procedure. 18. With reference to the last para, of your letter, I regret that I am unable to sanction the expenditure of the sum you apply for, as I have no funds left at my disposal. This however is not of so much consequence, as taking into consideration the circumstances under which you are going, and your having last January on your first introduction to the Murree and Boogfeo Chiefs, liberally treated them with presents, it will be unnecessary to do so again, and as any Chiefs who accompany you will be moving through their own country, there will be no necessity for your causing them and their followers to be fed, I have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. w.

Each point raised by Merewether is outlined in further detail throughout the letter.Merewether also outlines his opinion that further military advances in this area would be less beneficial to the Government of India than if a small amount of expenditure and expertise was used to improve the position of the Khan of Kelat and to enable him to establish outposts on the route from Quettah [Quetta] to Sind in order to protect merchants.Merewether also suggests that work could be undertaken to improve irrigation to the plain between the Sind Frontier, the Murree Hills and Cutchee [Cuchi] which would provide opportunities for all the hill tribes to earn a livelihood through cultivation.Merewether concludes by discussing how his remarks would affect the neighbouring frontier of the Punjaub [Punjab], including proposing that all dealings with the Murrees and Boogtees should be handled by one political superintendent only and suggesting that Phayre settle who this should be with Captain Robert Sandeman, the politicial superintendent for the Punjaub frontier. Merewether also outlines Sandeman's other proposals including establishing a post in the Shum plain, which he concurs with; and occupying Barkhan (Lugharee) which he cites Captain Sandeman's reasons for proposing as he is not sufficiently familiar with the area himself.The letter concludes by stating that although he is opposed to further occupation he does feel that a trip through the hills, carried out by officers of both frontier lines, would be beneficial in enabling them to become acquainted with the hill tribes and to gain useful knowledge of the country and its inhabitants. He also hopes that such a trip would have the benefit of enabling the hill tribes to see how disciplined troops operate.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
