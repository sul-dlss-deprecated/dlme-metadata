My lettercvms written in some heat at the Roy&amp;l-nerve in giving me a worthless animal in guise of a valuable present and I had already come to the conclusion that it would be impolitic to destroy it before receiving your letter. I hope to be able to dispose of it later. Major T.C.W.

It was a present,so far as I can understand,given to Captain Prior and had been kept by Shaikh Hejnad for some time. Captain Prior had recovered the mare and filly just before I-arrived. Neither of them were sufficiently heavy to make a hack for people of any weight. Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Muhammad had a look at the mare and filly and He said that he would let me know later on. On the evening of the 17th June he sent a servant to take the two away and on the 18th sent a letter of thanks for them. This correspondence should be kept on the file. 19-6-1933.Pile No 0 ■ MISCELLANEOUS, Horsee belonging to the Political Agent, Bahrain - Correspondence regmmof 1930 no. British. Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, thej?S^March 1930. To The Political Agent, Bahrein. Memorandum. f\ Reference your letter No.463 dated the 15th March 1930. The Hon’ble the Political Resident thinks it would create a most undesirable impression to have the mare shot. As the mare is only a two year old could you arrange with Shaikh Hamad or some one to keep it in his stables for a year or two on the plea that it is too young to ride and then see how she turns out? If she turns out of little use the mare can be disposed of quietly then. By order.

The correspondence concerns: Prior’s disdain at the gift, noting that the mare is ‘quite useless’ (f 3, f 10); the transfer of the horses to stables in Bahrain belonging to Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah; file notes dated 1933, concerning Prior’s successor’s (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch) attempt to determine the present circumstances of the horses, and their transfer to Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah (ff 5-8).
