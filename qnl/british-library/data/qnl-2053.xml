There is at the moment' in Delhi a certain Sir Richard Nosworthy of the Foreign Office who has come out for the purpose of interviewing a limited number of candidates who might care to be considered for these provisional appointments, which of course will be without prejudice to their prospects of obtaining permanent appointments in H.M.G's Services. He has selected (on a purely hit-and-miss principle) a certain number of names of officers whom he would like to interview and among them is your name. Would you be good enough to telegraph immediately on receipt of this letter -and the attached memorandum, saying whether you would care to be considered? If so, arrangements will be made in the most imnediate future for an interview. G.N.Jackson, Esq., S Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah (Persian Gulf) Yours sincerely, Sd.

NPG.qo Extract from the proceedings of a conference of Residents held by the Political Department on April 9th and 10th 1947. 9. Release from service . It was explained that applications from members of the Indian Political Service to be allowed to leave the service before the date on which the Political Department would close would have to be dealt with on an ad hoc basis. The factors involved were so uncertain that no programme of releases could be worked out in advance. It would accordingly be extremely difficult to avoid hard luck cases, but everything would be done, consistent with the demands of the public service, to meet the wishes of those concerned. 10. In the meanwhile it would help if as soon as an announcement had been made in regard to retirement on proportionate pension and compensation, if any. Political Officers would inform the Political Department through the usual channels what they wished to do in regard to continuing in service. The wishes expressed would be regarded as tentative and in no way binding. 11. In reply to a question it was explained that a summary of the confidential record of each Political Officer who had applied for employment under His Majesty's Government had already been prepared and that similar summaries would shortly be prepared an in respect of any other officer who had indicated his intention of seeking re-employment through a re-employment bureau. These summaries would in due course be forwarded to the India and Burma Services Re-employment Branch in the India Office which, it was hoped, would soon be established and it would be open to anyone seeking re-employment to invite his prospective employer to obtain details of his past service and record from this Re-employment Branch. Further details about this Branch would be communicated to all Political Officers as soon as they were available. NPG.KXP :U:GS LSTTfii . Prom - political, Bahrain. To - Repgu, Bahrain. Ko.C/585.
