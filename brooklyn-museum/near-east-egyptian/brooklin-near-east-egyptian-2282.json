That portion of this line which lies on the leg is cut by a series of short parallel lines. These lines, which are beneath the glaze, appear to be painted on. The apparent continuation of this line, from mid-calf down under the leg, is a crack which is also beneath the glaze. There is no other trace of paint on this piece.\r\nCondition: Rim chipped.
