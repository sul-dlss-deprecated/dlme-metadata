Immigration of the «Jews to Bahrain and complaint against the actions of the British jidviser. . Since the last 4 years the British authorities have stopped the entry of Arabs into Bahrain and especially the journalists so that they may not publish its news and disclose the action of the officials^ They have now opened the door of the country for the dews whose arrivals have lately increased in number from \ \ ^Ita island and some of them have been granted Bahrain nationality, dhen one walks in the Al Qasaibi road he will find that new business places have been opened by the Jews who were brought by the British to our country in order to compete with us in our means of living, monopolise our trade, destroy our economies and to be a vanguard for their own race. We have heard that many of them are making preparations to immigrate to the OUlf. A propaganda has been spread in the country to boycot them ' and not to deal with them. It is hoped that this will be generalised so that the country may get rid of them before they are followed by others. Perhaps the British Government will rescue us from them. Bahrain and the British Adviser. The people of Bahrain are bitterly complaining against the despotism of the British Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, on account of • his sole exercise of authority and against the British Government for controlling the revenue of Bahrain which they have made as an Indian colony. Bahrain was enjoying a good deal of liberty and its al Khalifah Amirs were the highest authorities in the country, but after the claim advanced by Iran to occupy Bahrain and its endeavours in the League of Nations, the British showed an unfavourable attitude towards the Bahrainis and the British Adviser started exercising fill authority; he is the real Huler and2. and in sole comniand; h.e disposes and spends 'the income of 'the country which, is not less than one million rupees a year in any way he likes, ^e has allowed the -^uler an annual stipend of Hs.15000 only. We complain to the -^rab world against this state of affairs and approach the British Government requesting them to remove their Adviser who injures their reputation in Bahrain and replace him by another man who should respect the rights and the agreements. Complaint of the workmen. Ihe Arab workmen of Bahrain have complained against the low wages paid by the American Co. which extracts the oil# The Company give them a different treatment from that which they give to the foreign workmen. The Arabs have been lodged in hats built for them of date sticks whereas the Indian workmen have been lodged in decent buildings provided with electric lights, i'hey (Indian) drink distilled water but the Arab workmen drink brackish water, ilie wages are also different, ihe wages of An Arab workman is Bs.90 per mensem but an Indian gets Hs.200/-. The treatment of the Company had a very bad effect on the feelings of the nationals of Bahrain who are suffering from this state of affairs. We request the aathorities to call upon the Company to treat their workmen equally. .Vho is he. 'The people of Bahrain complain against the Inspector of Education, Adham Faiq, Syrian, on account of his interference in affairs which do not concern his appointment, and his assistance to the British Adviser in all his affairs and activities. It is said that he has not come to Bahrain for this purpose. Perhaps he will not compel us afterwards to write farther details about him. Thanks to A1 HaMtah . The youth of Bahrain express their sincere thanks to the A1 Habitah al Arabiah magazine and its founder, the great master, for3. for sapporting the cause of Bahrain and defending its oppressed nation, ^e is the man who opened his heart to us and defended our ^ause and communicated our appeal and complaint to the world for which he deserves gratitude.

Baggallay, Esci. , Foreign Office.(W From Franiifurter Zeitung of yth August, 1938. On the Bahrain Islands. The play for oil and power in the Persian Gulf.* H.B. 'It is quite irapossilole that you should 'be able to come to Bahrain, English people will not 'allow any one to enter'. This assurance is given to those arriving in Baghdad by Germans, Swiss and Arabs, It is equally difficult to get to Kuwait. It is even difficult for diplomats of States that are friendly to England to obtain permission. Furthermore dreadful things are reported about Bahrain: there is no hotel, there is no possibility of finding suitable accommodation except with 1 dirt; Arabs 1 , no sweet water, a dampish heat in comparison with which the dry heat of Baghdad is like high mountain air. If, after such narrations, a permit to enter is put before the British Legation by the 'political Agent' in Bahrain, 'provided that it can be proved that a suitable accommodation can be found', the first distrustful thought comes up:- 'Oh.' disguised form of refusal: because of course there is no possibility of finding accommodation'. But see, the friendly English Consulate Official asks whether it would not be possible to stay over night with the .American Missionary, and suggests sending a telegram to the Adviser of the Bahrain Government'. The telegram costs a lot of money. But the answer brings the permission to live in the Government Rest House.&gt; 2. B ritish Doin inio n in t he Persian Gulf. The sensitiveness of the English in matters of the Persian Gulf is not new, T/hen before the war a single Russian or a few German trading vessel landed in the Ports of the Gulf5 already a nervous excitement started in the Indian Government. In order to meet this danger Sir Percy Cox was nominated as British Resident in Buschir. 1914 Wassmuss from Buschir writes about hiiin— n He has considered it as his life's problem to bring the whole of the Persian Gulf under British Dominion.' In the 19th century this dominion actually existed ? even if not by international law. There exists an old political sentence: who holds India, must hold the Persian Gulf. In the 16th century it was the Portuguese with tfteir splendid forts in Bahrain and Muscat. After an interregnum the English followed them. It was not easy for them to prevent the rise of the thriving pirate system. It was necessary to protect the pearl fishery and the pearl transport to Bombay and to restrain to a certain extent the slave traffic from the Arabian and Iranian coast. With the coast Shaikhs of both sides agreements were concluded. The coast on the Arabian side from now onwards was not called 'Pirate coast' but 'Trucial coast' - Truce - or Agreement coast, in the Deginning a far too flattering expression. Since the war and the strengthening of Iran the position in the Gulf has fundamentally been altered. Before there hardly existed a difference between an Iran and an Arabian Shaikh. The chiefs of the tribes around Buschir and Lingah had showed themselves independent for decades. Now suddenly they have to make the choice to either bow to the new and stronger government of Shah Rhizah or to disappear in the gaol of Teheran, Many disappear. All of a sudden the English/ 'W': • ^ Hi' ( k l m&gt; English miss the many small intriguing adversaries; they find, themselves face to face with one adversaryj the government of the Shah, One event makes them tremble more than anything else. It is the fate of the Shaikh of Mohommerah. Mohommerah lies nearly opposite Basrah in the middle of palm date woods at the east side of Schatt-el-Arab only a few kilometers ahove Ahadan, above the greatest oil refinery of the world, that is where the tankships of the Britisn Admiralty load the oil of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company. Special bonds of friendship united the English Government with the Shaikh of this strategic important point. His wonderful palace was mirrored in the waters of the Shatt el-Arab s the festivities of his yacht were world renowned. Prom one of these festivities one day the Shaikh was taken to Teheran - not in an auto with splendid entourage, as he was accustomed, but on the back of an ordinary donkey, over the many bare mountains, through the desert, mile after mile to the north to the capital of the Shah, whose order he had not followed voluntarily. Over this occurrence a severe difference of opinion amongst the English was caused. The Indian Government in Simla wished to help the Shaikh. The reason they gave v/as If we do not save him then the word of our Agent at the Gulf will discontinue to have any power, because the English Agents had promised the Shaikh their full support. The Foreign Office, however, who in every way wished to be on friendly terms with Teheran were not prepared to stand for the Shaikh. The Shaikh was sacrificed; he remained in Teheran up to the time of his death. 5etr uat in stages . The events with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, in the middle of the twenties, was only a beginning. It shows the world at the Persian Gulf, that the Shah was determined to reconstitute/ ireconstituto the full sovereignty of the Iran State. The second stage is 1931 that, the 'Imperial Air Mails' were prohibited to fly over the Iranian coast. The third followed in April 1935^ the 'voluntary' removal of the English Naval support point from Hendjam and Basidu on the Iranian side to Bahrain. By this opportunity Sir Arnold Wilson, the High Commissioner in Baghdad, later Director of the Anglo Iranian Oil Company, in Ataadan, put some unpleasant questions to the Foreign Minister, Sir John Simon* 'Has the British sovereignty which was exercised over a part of the island Basidu, now been officially withdrawn? Is it not a fact that there the British flag had flown for over ICO years ^ that repeatedly this place has 'been declared as a British territory: and has not this attitude iDeen frequently put forward 'before the Iranian G-overnment?' Sir John Simon did not know what oetter answer to give than, 'The local climatic conditions were not healthy, and the place was not British territory. His Majesty's Government has recently decided that their b)est interests would 'be served in the Persian Gulf 'by transferring the station to Bahrain on the Arabian side of the Gulf.' This play at question and answer shov/s how unclear the conditions at the Persian Gulf are. The English power relies on agreements of friendship and protectorate with various Shaikhs. The Iranian Government disputes the right of the Iranian Shaikhs to such agreements. But how far does the Iranian territory go? To-day the English are still in Ahwaz and in Abadan, the starting and the ending point of the Anglo Iranian pipe line - hut here not under the British flag, 'but 'by virtue of the oil concession, obtained 'by William Knox D'Arcy in 1901. In 1932 this concession was given notice 'by Teheran, The case/case was put 'bcforG tho League of Nations. England had to put a million sterling on the tahle, increase the payments to the Iranian Government from 16 to 20% of the net profit, a tribute of 9 pence on each ton of raw oil produced had to 'be conceded. This arrangement was frequently looked upon as a defeat for England. From the standpoint of a gradual clearing of Iran from British influence, English however had maintained its position hut with financial sacrifices* But what are financial sacrifices when the supply to the English fleet in case of war are concerned? With respect to Abadan the dispute between Irak and Iran over Sohatt-el-Arab is so important for Londonj although it does not touch England officially in any way. With the Irak-Iranian agreement of 1937 the territorial disputes have been settled. But the questions so important for England as regards shipping and water control still await to be settled. For the present the tide flows of the yellow Tigris and Euphrates which touch Abadan coast are still pure Irak. Abadan is an alluvial land islandj something like a lagoon and the narrow watercourse which separates the island from the main land,, is not navigable. Thus the Iranian ships have for the present no possibility to come near to the hundreds of tanks and pipe lines, the chimneys and iron towers of the town. For years Iran demands the middle of Schatt-el-Arab as boundary. On the basis of the agreement of 1937 discussions are to take place as to this point and as to the setting up a river commission. The great question is- will the river commission be simply Irak-Iran, or will a third party be brought in as arbiter? And if a third party will it be a neutral or an Englishman? All British energy is concentrated to-day on the Arabian side/ &lt; M@ 6, side of the Gulf. Overnight Pirate Shaikhs have 130001110 oil and air Shaikhs. The 'building of the new air line starts 1931 with the forced retreat of the Iranian side, Basrah ? Bahrain^ Sohardjah are principal stations. The oil finds start in Bahrain^ and are followed 'by Kuwait and el Hosa. To-day geologists are active on the whole of the Arabian coast up to Muscat. The districts are divided up between Englishmen and Americans. New agreements of friendship and concessions are entered into. In 1936 the Shaikh of Bahrain Hamid bin Isah al Kalifah is in London on a State visit. In March 1938 the Sultan of Oman and Muscat is received in London by the King. He owns the Plying support station on the opposite side of the seay near to the Iran frontier 9 on the coast of Baluchistan. To whom does Bahrain belong ? Bahrain lies immediately in front of the Arabian coast in its own largo bayj but it also lies between Arabia and Iran, In the year 1927 Iran started in Geneva to protest against the British sovereignty. It dates its claim back to its former possession of Bahrain in the 18th century. The English thesis however reads- in the 18th century an ancestor of the present Shaikh had vanquished from the Arabian mainland the last Shaikh \^io had been under Iran supremacy. The family reigned independently for 150 years, until she entered into the agreement of friendship and protectorate with England which exists to-day. The League of Nations accepts the protest of Iran without however taking any note of the question. In the first years the protests perhaps were more of a theoretical nature - who was interested in this flat deserted group of islands with its dreadful climate? Since the finding of oil Bahrain is important to both sides. Iran remains consistent with its/7. its claims. No traveller who in his passport has a British visa for entering Bahrain is allowed to pass the Iran frontier. The direct telegraph line with Bahrain has been interrupted, England answers with the expulsion of many thousands of Iran workmen,, who had rushed to the island;, when twenty thousand workers were installated for the 'building of the refinery. The explanation of taking this position is given that they had to look after the local inhabitants which otherwise would have been threatened with unemployment, England has every reason to hold on to Bahrain. The Iran side of the Gulf has been lost. At the top end is Irak, an ally and friend, but nevertheless a sovereign State. On the Arabian side there are of course the 'independent w friendly coast Shaikhs but behind them the power of Ibn Saud threatens. Who can vouch for it that this King would not some day incorporate the whole-coast territory into his territory that has already been increased so many times? As last and safest point there remains the island which controls all the hemispheres and is difficult to attack, the island with the oilwells and the u ideal Plying Station between London and Singapore'. Journey to the islands . The atmosphere on the ships from and to Bahrain has something of a Joseph Conrad's novel, it is the old 'Gulf' atmosphere, from a time when the Persian Gulf stood alone, when everybody knew each other, when the great Europeans, the politicians and merchant princes still associated in a friendly manner with the Shaikhs. On the English steamers of the Basrah Bombay Line the old people sit together with their port and sherry. We are awaiting the tide which is to carry us over the small sandy banks of Schatt-el-Arab, The Captain/Captain speaks of the time v /hon the ships of the 'Mespers u nov/ the 'British India Steam Ship Navigation Company' 1 ran with an attack into a small furrow between the sand 'banks until they got stuck in order when the next tjde came to make a renewed attack. Two nights latere anchor clattering with a stormy sea. In the strong search light of the ship three large motor dhows run into each other against the 'board side. White clad Arabs tug at thick rope in order to hold the boats. Coolies and passengers scream as if all the vessels we re sinking at once. Beside the old generation ? which had spent its life on the Gulf 5 which had sworn against the Gulf and also loved it^ a new generation has appeared which lives in the restless atmosphere of oil. They are the petroleum engineersj young Americans and young Englishmen. They have contracts for eighteen months,, for two or three years. The Gulf does not interest them. It is a short station on the way, which leads from California to Mexico, East Indies, Bahrain and Texas. They erect boring towers, lay pipe lines and build refineries. As far as the Arabs are concerned their installation is like that of a Berlin charlady who is used to all modern comfort; they see dirt and customs they do not understand. When the eighteen months or the three years have passed of their contract, they let themselves down with a sigh of relief in a deck chair and say: 'This is the moment for which I have been waiting for many months'. They all say it, during the whole of a morning, they tell each other again and again, it must come from the heart. There is no love for this island on which they have lived for two years. Their home is the refinery and the camp. The camp is everywhere the same; steriotyped comfort. The refineries are different according to mode of building, the most/ A, ■ r—9. most modern are the most desired. Also the old 'Gulf people have their secrets, there are the all known, the silent people of the 'Intelligence Service TT in all stations of life. The -foreigner remains strictly out of all knowledge of the most . inner Gulf.conditions. But if you once belong to it you are treated with openness. On the other hand the Oil world is not a closed world, it is split by the mistrust of competitors. The atmosphere of the secret is as thick as in a large family at Christmas time. Hie 'Standard Oil' Hie 'Irak Petroleum Co.' The ships management in tactful manner put the enemy camps at different tables. The three islands . The awakening in the rest house ofthe Bahrain Government, in a room with a rush mat cover over wooden lathes, with thick walls and deep window ledges belongs again to the atmosphere of Conrad's novels. The white clad boy who brings the morning tea and asks when the bath was required is from Portuguese India. His uncle is cook and manager of the Rest House, There are four guest rooms a wide lofty living room with comfortable chairs, a dining room. The Rest House has hardly been in existence for more than four months. As former guests have been entered in the visitors book; they are only Englishmen and Hindoos. Bahrain is not an island but a group of three islands. In the north the former principal island Muharraq with the old town, the palaces of the Shaikhs and of the rich pearl dealers, the well built bazaar streets, with a natural bay and many sail ing boats. Since the English have erected a custom house in Manamah, the most northern village of the larger island, Manamah has become the capital. The reigning Shaikh has built for himself here a new palace; the residence of the 'Political Agent' and that of the 'Adviser' stand in beautiful gardens near the sea, Government buildings and a tribunal have been erected. In contrast to Baghdad the English have not spoilt the picture of the island by modern buildings. They are continuing to build in10. Bahrain; wide important houses with thick walls. In the 'basement are store and office localities, on the first floor are verandahswide as a room around the whole house ? behind the dwelling rooms, protected from every direct sunbeams, ready to take every whiff of air that there might be'.. The visitor who sails from Manamah to Muharraq does not see anything of the oil, who goes about in the workers quarters as in places of contentment. Every where else in the Arabian world there are children who carry loads, who work ten to fourteen hours daily at the looms, children who beg in the streets who with sores .with mattery eyes sit in dirty courts. In Bahrain there are children that play. They go in their long white shirts or only in shorts happy to the sea and sail their self made boats, they are not oppressed or prematurely suffering, but erect dark brown little people. The second event which has nothing to do with the surroundings is the first unsuccessful visit to the 'Adviser'. Not a soul in the court yard or in garage or stables, nobody to look after the stair on the first floor, nobody above on the verandah. There the doors of the living rooms are open, books, pictures, carpets, valuable articles - all is open and proves the confidence and security in this small island. The 'Adviser' who has brought about this paradise existence is very tall and blue eyed Mr. Dalrymple Belgrave. He appears very young for so very responsible position. He comes from the service in the Soudan. In the Soudan the English carry on a colonial government which is an example on not to Europeanise is the desire there but the further development of native customs and laws. The same principle has been adopted by Mr. Belgrave ■with the best success in Bahrain. With a handful of English soldiers he keeps order. The budget is equalised: streets schools hospitals are beiiig built, clean meat and fish markets arranged. One of the most important regulations is the strictly adhered to alcohol prohibition. However at a distance of about11. .25 kilometers in the oil camp, there are cocktail parties ami whiskey flows in streams. The permanent success of Mr. Belgrave' s work will depend greatly-, whether it will he possible for him to continue to keep the two worlds separate, the 500 'Westier' of the oil world and the 40,000 Arabs who belong to the old world Gulf. In the oil camp . In one of the newly well polished taxis of Manamah the journey goes southwards through the palm date groves which gradually become more sparse until the last trees are relieved by the desert. Faultless black asphalt streets run like foreign bodies over the sparkling levels, autobuses flash by, taxis and elegant private carriages. Right and left hundreds of small hills loom up,- sandy graves of vanished, unknown people. The sky is white from the accumulated moisture, the sun is disc in the mist - strikingly hot. The desert is yellow white. On the horizon loom up white blazing forms; the giant silver painted benzine tanks. We are approaching the oil refineries; black trestles in front of a whitish sky, chimneys, towers, cooling plants and surrounding all this, wire netting. At the entrance a sentry, a policeman of Bahrain, wearing a dark red tasselled cap. From the construction office one goes to the management office. This is not in the refinery, but a few kilometers away m the living camp. Between the two there are cottages covered with foliage for the native workers v/hich are called coolies, perhaps because formerly the workers were from India. A young engineer from Texas acts as conductor, 'We go in a new motor direct into the moon district. It has a God forsaken impiesoion on .uo. These crumbled crater mountains are very high, the highest is not more than 130 meters, but in this flat district they have a rejecting and bad influence on one. We approach the very fj.rst boring hole, dug in the winter of 1931 to 1932, There is not much to be seen; a perpendicular black tube in the ground, a dark pit for the cooling water, two piping lines.Just near these first wells there are a few tumbled down houses; the first direction building and the first dwelling houses. They are six years old and are already ruins. 'This is the rapid development with the oil people^ if it is found that a place is not suitable owing to the nightly heat rays from the mountain. We proceed to the new boring towers; 30 meters high iron trestles 3 in the middle of which is the borer with the tubing' stem works itself into the ground. As soon as one tubing length has disappeared a second one is screwed on to it^ and thus things proceed with rattling noise with unrelenting heat, with cooling water for the metal, meter for meter through the rocks. Up to 1937 boring was undertaken to a depth of 700 meters. This summer for the first time a trial was made to get to a depth of 1400 meters. Such a deep hole requires a period of boring of 8 weeks. We, proceed to the living camp. The young man is very proud of this. The company spares no expense. All wishes are fulfilled. One story single family houses with 3, 4 and 5 rooms - according to range of salary, with wonderful bathrooms and kitchens. The company provides all furniture. Only books, carpets pictures may be added by the individual according to his taste. New air cooled bachelors' houses are under construction. Communal dining rooms, served by Chinese cooks which come from Texas. The hospital with operation theatre, Roentgenray rooms and all the very latest appliances. The living room of the six nurses - new ones have to be continually added because they get engaged immediately -. We go on to the theatre, cinema and club house. One section is the school. There the little blond American girls, with a view on to the desert, learn the history of George Washington who had already taken an interest in oil. The main space of the clul) house is just being used for gymnastics for women. The young man is counting up? three tennis places, cricket patch, swimming pool and golf course. But one must not imagine a golf course with coolr I ©* green sod/ The golf course' is apiooe of burning desert, like every other piece of desert only with inserted holes. Battle for _the distribution market . 3 We procee(i t0 refinery, a refinery can only be understood by an expert and enjoyed by him. Whereas the refinery of the Anglo-Iranian in Abadan is the largest in the world, the one in Bahrain is the most modern. Here the company has spared less than at the camp. The yery latest methods hare been employed. Bvon two Germans were allowed for a few months to visit the mysterious ground of the island, namely to erect achmcs which are only constructed in Germany. The refinery has only been built two years ago. The English construction engineer on board said disapprovingly that it was built far too quickly. During the first year the crude oil was flowing over the narrow arm of the sea to Sitra, the third of the Bahrain islands, and xnto the sea up to a tank buoy. Today all oil products, with the exception of lubricating oil, are conducted in several tubes to Sitra; benzine of various kinds, diesel oil, heating oil, petroleum. To this must be added coke, gas and asphalt production for own use. Before the decision was come to build a refinery a secret oil conference was held in New York in October and November 1935 Hot much got into the hands of the press; participators besides the Californian standard Oil, the parent company of the 'Bapco' (Bahrain Petroleum Co) the Anglo-Iranian the Shell Union Oil, the Shell Transport and the Standard Oil of Now Jersey. The theme of the conference; whore and through whom is the Bahrain oil being distributed? The Californian Oil was not in possession of its own Transport and Distribution organisation. The conditions of the Competing firms wore evidently not acceptable. Instead of agreeing with the three biggest ones, the California Oil decided to make a pact with their worst competitor, the Texas Oil Co. Out of 'Bapco' became in 1938 'Caltex' (California and Texas Oil Co). The refinery was constructed at a cost of IS million dollars and ■already during building operations was being extended. East of Suez Canal thereby a new mighty oil competitor has come into existence. For the year 1937 the company reports a net profit of 4 million dollars with a daily production of 25000 barrels. In the year 1938 the expected net profit will be about 8 million dollars. W hy Americana and not Englishmen ? Some knowledge may be gained as to the oil and boring secrets on the Arabian coast on a tour, through the Gulf. The principal secret however remains unsolveds why are the Americans boring and not the Englishmen on this island for the safety of which England has spent so much money? and thought and diplomacy? All English press reports about Bahrain oil pass Over this point in a shamefaced manner. The engineers and geologists show innocent faces and know nothing. 'Who finds first grinds first' they murmur laughingly. But if you reply to thenu 'but the first who found was an Englishman, Major Holmes, the same who is now working in the Muscat district' Major Holmes offered the Bahrain concession to the Anglo Iranian., Why did they not take it over? Their faces become somewhat puzzled. The Anglo-Iranian will probably not have believed in a real oil existence, an engineer replies,' This does not sound very convincing, as the British Admiralty did not wish anything more keenly than to obtain oil from a territory subject to England, But to the first question a second one can be added, Y/hy are nothing but young English engineers employed and taught in the American refineries until there is a quota of 70 Englishmen of all higher employees. The two first questions lead to a third questicn. Are there secret agreements in existence between Englishmen and Americans? The Foreign Office could not have the desire to subject the Anglo-Iranian to further burdens, in view of the fact that before the League of Nations their existence had to be fought for. The taking over of a concession on an island in the Persian Gulf, towhich Iran puts forward a claim., would have moant such a 'burden. The Americans on the other hand are learning from year to year again that 'friendly' economic imperialism in an Utopia. It is not difficult to procure concessions in foreign countries against good dollars. To continue holding them without the help of arms, when they have once become productive, (sometimes proves to be impossible. The Americans are becoming careful. Consequences were drawn in the case of Mexico through the giving notice of the American oil concession in Nordostiran only a few weeks ago. in Bahrain the case is much more pleasant. Bahrain is the most important point of the British defence line between Basrah and India, safeguarded by British ships air lines, Naturalisation tendencies do not exist. England is less after the profit on oil than the security of the Gulf. Should however the English, in case of war, require the Bahrain oil, then they v^ould buy it. Thus in all quietness without the knowledge and interference of the American Isolationists the first step is being made in Bahrain for the cooperative working of the Anglo-Saxons, which both governments are striving for and in which the border line between economic and military politics is difficult to define. And even if the English prefer the spicy cooking of their Hindoo- Portuguese cooks to the American-Chinese camp cooking, and even if the living together of American and English in the camps is not always harmonious, it is nevertheless clear that the working together and 'good fellowship' between the men of both nations has been successful.L'ORIENT AKABK agence de presse /f] 1.

Ruggero Orlando. It is said in the article that to rule Arab countries is now a vital question to England for two reasonsx** First, to protect its land, sea and air communications with India and second to guarantee to the British Government, in cae of war, or the Iraq Petroleum Cy, in time of peace, the possession of Iraqi oil. The article thfen states that England is trying to push the Arabs away from the coasts and that the pl&amp;n is nearing success. The littoral of the itediterranean, of the Red 3ea, of the Aden Gulf, of the Indian Ocean and of the Persian Gull are no more the possession of the Arabs. The latter are now tryin to break the chain and attack the most vulnerable point which is Palestine. The policy Britain is believed to follow in order to ensure its supremacy is to create either union or division among the Arab countries. It seems now that England is more enclined towards ^nion after all it did to destroy it» The author thiJofes that the Congress recently held in Cairo is a step towards the realisation of the £lac ihon-.Iarc Sykes- Lawrence plan aiming at an Arab Union under England's protection. This question was prepared and presented at the Congress thanks to the efforts of the Iraqi Pasha Noury £1 Said and the Jyrian Chahbandar both well known for their friendly afctx relations with England. Proceeding, the author says that two of the nain difficulties to an Arab union are about to be blotted out. French supremacy has much weakened in the East thanks to the 'Front Populaire' Government. France is about to abandon Syria and will be content with a mere protectorate over the Lebanons and Alaouites.- 2.- Jews seem willing to abandon their vast claims in the hope to restore peace in Palestine. So England is free to follow its new policy which consists in uniting Syria and Palestine to Iraq, in pushing the Arabs away from the Sea, in taking lexandretta from them, in putting the Lebanons and .daouites under French protecto rate and in creating a Jewish National Home in Palestine. England believes this policy to give satisfaction to the Arabs while it guarantees the British military and political as well as economical interests. The author ends by saying that the creation of an Arab union connected with the Kingdom of Egypt might bring forward again the question of the Islam Khalifat question of the Islam Khalifat.-L'ORIEMT A_RA.BE agence de presse 1, RUE CENTRALE ( SOL iman pacha) TELEPHONE 56380 LE CAIRE o(Li.|j olA - *') IAL** N o^r« • oyi; izf ^. n ^ef-Ba' Damascus 9.11.38 (j a^Aldll The Damascus daily paper 'Alef Ba H published on the Sth Nov ber the following informationt ' The correspondent of the Iraqi Enquiry Bureau states that regrettable incidents took place in Kuwait after the dismissal by the Legislative Council of Mollah Saleh, Secretary to the Amir, A manifestation wa s held asking the Council to take Mollah Saleh back, while another manifestation, held by the Youth of Kuwait asked for the dismissal of Mollah Saleh's son who is acting as Government delegate to the Oil Company, The two manifestations met and a fight starred.

Gihson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I, 11 Birchin Lane, London, E.G.3. 16th December, 1938. Dear Mr. G-ibson, I send you herewith a copy of 'The American Magazine' for January 1939. I would direct your attention to the article it contains 'by Jerome Beatty, entitled 'Is John Bull's Pace Red'. Mr. Beatty is the gentleman who endeavoured to get to Bahrein in the early part of this year 'but the Company prevented his doing so 'because they did not want the publicity likely to arise from the efforts of a person of his description. He had announced his intention of 'writing up' Bahrein for a quite reputable magazine called 'Reader's Digest'. Why the article did not appear in the Reader's Digest, I do not know. The present article seems to 'be nothing more than rather poor journalese. As some important facts are omitted from the story, I would not 'be inclined to take it at all seriously: to do so might 'be giving publicity to the article which will benefit nobody but the magazine and the writer. An advance copy of the article was sent to my Company in San Francisco by the magazine people, they took immediate action to prevent it appearing but it was already in print; in other words, the advance copy was sent to them too late to enable them to do anything effective in the way of preventing its appe arance. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R. Ballantyne.is john bull's face red: By Jerome Beatty. Halfway down the Persian Gulf? on the opposite side of the world from San Francisco, thirty miles from the east coast of Arabia5 is the Island of Bahrein, a slah of desert, 'boiling in heat and humidity. It is an independent Arah state, protected 'by the British government, which would like it very much if you would stop reading this article right now. On the sand in the middle of Bahrein is a neat white ultramodern city which cost ^25,000,000 to 'build and which includes 50 oil wells and a ^IS,000,000 refinery. There are homes, a hospital, clubs, a school, a movie theater, a 'beauty parlor, and a commissary, all air-conditions and full of electric gadgets, from kitchen ranges to curling irons. It has a population of more than 500 American and British men, women, and children. In date-stick huts near 'by live several thousand native workmen. It is one of the world's great oil fields and, except in the oil trade, a closely guarded secret. It was discovered and 'built up 'by the Standard Oil Company of California, which produces the oil. The Texas Corporation sells it chiefly in British territories in Africa, Asia and Australasia. The Americans' overlord is His Highness Sheik Sir Hamad 'bin Isa A1 Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrein. A few years ago he rode a camel when he wanted to survey his domain and his 50,000 sun-baked subgects. Much of his income depended upon Bahrein's pearl-diving fleet, which is hard up 'becauseof the competition of Japanese cultured pearls. Now his share of the oil 'brings him plenty rupees and he doesn't have to worry over the low price of pearls, and tours his island (27 miles long and 10 miles wide) in one of his dozen expensive motorcars, the fastest of which he often uses to chase gazelles over the flat desert south of the oil wells. He is pretty much under the thumb of the British - he has given them a naval 'base there - 'but he certainly does like those Americans! The rub in Bahrein is that for years the British government and British oil companies, which are tied in one 'bundle, told each other, told His Highness and all parties who wanted them to gamble on a test well, that there was no oil there. They had the whole business within their reach 'but put too much faith in their surveyors and an encyclopedia, which states confidently, 'Oil and asphalt shows occur in Kuwait and Bahrein, 'but the prospect of oil heing found in those territories in adquate quantities is slender.' The Americans, to whom they relinquished what they though was a worthless concession, are now refining 30,000 'barrels a day and are sure the island can produce 100,000 a day without grunting. The Texas Corporation has announced to its stock holders that Bahrein oil will show a profit of ^8,000,000 for 1958. The British government has 'been quite successful in keeping from the British people the embarrassing facts ahout Bahrein. Tourists never go near the place. British officials there are said to write or censor all the news that goes out. The British political agent sits at the right hand of the sheik,and writers who ask for a visa are politely and firmly asked to withdraw their request. One woman journalist who slipped/3. slipped in was asked to leave on the next 'boat, and some mysterious influence was 'brough to 'bear so that she never wrote a line ahout Bahrein. Employees of the oil company are forbidden to write or talk for puhlication, American officials of the company, who are dependent upon the British for co-operation there and in British markets, won't talk. I got in and out 'before anybody caught me. The only time the secret threatened to 'be exposed was in 1934, when, in the House of Commons, Mr. Gordon R. Hall Gaine demanded an explanation as to why Americans were taking the oil out of a British-protected state, and Sir John Simon confessed, 'The Bahrein oil concession was originally acquired 'by a British syndicate, and was subsequently transferred to United States interests 'by them. The British syndicate who first acquired the concession have stated that before they transferred it to the United States they endeavoured unsuccessfully to attract possible British concessionaires'. And Sir John began quickly to talk about conditions in Manchukuo. The incident was noted only in British oil-trade publications. One said sharply, 'Here, on territory with British associations, was a chance for our oil patriots to score. The instance is one more proof that Britain has no oil policy worth the name,' The policy of England's India Office, which has charge of politics in the Persian Gulf, is to keep out of the small amount of news that gets out of Bahrein any mention of the fact that it is an American concession. It doesn't go so far as to make misstatements or say that the British own the oil wells, but it does approve articles which tell about the great number of British who are working there. The whole affair - a story of amazing coincidence, good luclc/luck for Americans 9 'br.d judgment 'by British - was started 'by Major Frank Holmes, a hearty New Zealander who for years has 'been a rnan-ahout-the-world, ready to promote any project - mostly gold and copper mines - that might make him a reasonable profit. He lives now in Kuwait, at the head of the Persian Gulf where - the encyclopedia to the contrary notv/ithstanding - a driller from Texas struck oil last May, opening what may 'be another 'big field, controlled 'by .America's Gulf Oil Corporation and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. The Bahrein strike gave the Americans a chance to get a foot in British- protected territory. Major Heines, like others concerned in the deal, won't talk for publication, for he needs the friendship of British officials. But in Iraq and Iran.and up and down the Gulf, in territory that is rapidly becoming of major importance to the oil industry, you find oil men who know the entire story. English oil men, particularly, with good sportsmanship and many chuckles, love to tell how their 'bigv/igs in London missed the boat. Their admiration for the skill and enterprise of Americans is tremendous. \ Oil in huge quantities was discovered in southern Persia, now Iran, by the British about twenty-five years ago. All the near-by rulers, most of them in need of money, began to wonder if there wasn't oil in their countries, too. Ibn Sa'ud, ruler of Arabia, ally of the Sheik of Bahrein, was one of those. In 1922 ho sent a representative to London to try to get the British to drill in Arabia. The representative made the rounds, but nobody was interested.. Their geologists had told them there was no oil in that part of Arabia. Just as the Arab envoy was about to return, defeated, he was introduced to Major Holmes, who up to that moment had no thought/thought of promoting oil anywhere* He 'became interested, poked around in 'books and reports, guessed that Bahrein looked promising,and want there. It was an unpropitious moment. The Sheik had no interest in oil. He wanted water, and wanted it quick. All of Bahrein's drinking water was 'being blown out to sea. Although AralDS had lived there for several thousand years and Europeans had 'been trading there for eighty years, there was no fresh water on Bahrein or the adjacent little island of Muharraq. But offshore, in the sea, were springs of sweet water, and the Arahs would go out in 'boats and dip it out. Whenever storms came the sweet water would he mixed with the salt 'before Arabs in storm-tossed boats could get it. There had 'been a long series of storms, and the Sheik was sending dhows to the mainland in a frantic effort to get water for his subjects. CI Adapting himself instantly to the situation, Homes turned from oil promoter to water promoter. He guessed that if there was sweet water in the sea, there must 'be plenty underground on the island. 'I'll drill a well on each island,' he gold the Sheik. 'If I find good drinking water, you pay me £(15,000 for each well and talk to me ahout an oil concession. If I fail, it costs you nothing.' The Sheik agreed. Holmes shipped in drilling machinery and a water expert, and within two months had 2 wells of sweet water, a contract to drill 20 more at a nice profit - and the oil concession. In 1892 the Sheik of Bahrein had agreed with the British not to 'cede, sell, or mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of his territory save to the British government.' That meant that Major Holmes could sell his concession/6. concession only to the Britishj unless they waived their rights. Major Holmes employed five of the 'best geologists in Europe 3 and they examined Bahrein. One said there was a fair prospect that oil would 'be found in paying quantities; the others advised against drilling. But Holmes wasn't discouraged. For six years he went from office to office in London trying to get the government and the oil harons to take a chance on Bahrein, He admitted it was a long shot. He had one favourable report and wanted them to 'bet on that. They weren't interested. He tried to interest small English capitalists. 'If there was oil,' they said, 'the 'big companies would have 'been in there years ago.' 'Holmes was the worst nuisance in London', an Englishman told me. 'People ran when they saw him coming.' He groaned, 'And to think he had papers in his pocket worth millionsl' At last Holmes asked if the British would waive their treaty rights and permit him to try to interest American capital. They gave him a quick answer: If any American was so insane as to waste money in Bahrein, the British didn't mind. Holmes went to the G-ulf Oil Corporation, Andrew W. Mellon's company, in Pittsburgh. Mr. Mellon was Secretary of the Treasury. G-ulf was interested enough to send one of its own geologists, R.O. Rhodes, to Bahrein. His report filled only half a page. It said there were excellent prospects of finding oil, and on a map he marked two spots for the first test wells. G-ulf got ready to drill. Suddenly Homes received word the deal was off. Mr. Mellon was about to 'be made Ambassador to England. If G-ulf/Gulf hit oil in Bahrein there would l^e political complications ? and he was getting rid of all 'business that might touch politics® The Gulf companyj however, said it would help Holmes make a deal with another company. ,} Let me try again to put this through in England5 ,, Holmes said. He returned to London, made the rounds again 9 this time pointing out that an American geologist had made a favourable report ? that an American company would drill if the British didn't. The British doggedly said there was no oil in Bahrein. Holmes returned to America. Gulf sold its share in the concession to Standard of California for ^fSO^OOO. They hit oil at 2j008 feet in June 9 1932, A story you hear in the Persian Gulf runs to the effect that Standard of California had decided to take a chance on a 2,000- foot well, that when drillers reached the 2,000 foot-level they cabled San Francisco that it was a dry hold, and the British on Bahrein held a big celebration. San Francisco cabled back, 'Drill .till your money runs out and then come home,' They had enough money to go 25 feet farther. Eight feet past the 2,000~foot mark they hit i.t .....It's a good story, but Standard officials deny it. Bahrein has no deep-water port, and from the spot where the little British Indie, boat anchors it is a three mile ride in a native motorboa.t to 'the dock and the chief town of Manama, In this town are about 20,000 Arabs, a few British and an American mission and hospital. Alongshore are two- story buildings, back of them a few hundred Arab) houses, then hundreds of huts and the desert. The desert is crossed by an asphalt road built by the oil company to its development ten miles away. On the trip you pass the Bahrein laundry - a score of natives/ 7.8. natives in a stream, whanging the clothes on stones to 'beat out the dirt. Your car dodges camels, donkeys, she.ep, goats, and children. You go through acres of huge prehistoric 'burial mounds. Suddenly, like a mirage reflected all the way from Oklahoma City, loom the huge refinery, the tall stacks, the immense tanks. The oil wells are far 'beyond. You pass orderly rows of date-stick huts, each one numbered. You reach the modern town, filled with 'busses, motorcars, and trucks, dark men in native dress and 'blond sub-'burned men in shorts and topees and shirts invariably open at 'the throat. You are not likely to see any of the 85 women and 25 children until evening, when they all start for the theater or swimming pool. I was told ahout a veteran oil man who had worked in Central America, Egypt, and Iran and who, one day in Bahrein, wiped his dripping 'brow , dropped exhausted on his 'bed, and moaned, 'Why in hell can't they ever strike oil in Paris?' Bahrein is sixteen days 'by air and 'boat from California, a month 'by train and 'boat. Imperial Airways has made it a regular stop on the London-India route, and when construction 'began the company flew about 300 English and American engineers and skilled laborers there to direct the natives. There was nothing on the island the company could use but oil, sand, stone, camels, donkeys, and Arabic—speaking natives. The company engineers and housing experts in San Francisco have shipped everything from toothpaste and canned corn to concrete mixers and dynamos. A year and a half after oil was found, the first shipload of supplies arrived. The cargo was carried ashore on barges and dhows, except the big tanks, which were floated in. Side by side, Arabs, Americans, British, camels, donkeys, tractors, trucks/9. trucks, and steam rollers, sweated and groaned. In 105 days the first cargo of crude oil gushed through a pipe line into the ship at the mooring three miles offshore. Everybody took a good rest except the claim adjuster, who found his hands full quieting with rupees infuriated fishermen who said the oil dripping into the water had made all the fish run out to sea. To keep the natives' good will was important. They cabled San Francisco for gadgets, and in two months the pipe line was fixed so that not a drop of oil went into the sea* Construction has never ended. Only last spring were housing plans completed, with air conditioning in the last of the 71 houses and 'bachelor apartments. Now it is discovered seat that the 250/movie theater is too small, and a new one is 'being started. There are tennis courts, a golf course, cricket and soccer fields, free outboard motorboats and sailboats. The services of doctor and dentist are free. Food and lodging are furnished to the 'Europeans 5 ', as all who are not natives are called in that part of the country, American tobacco and English liquor are cheaper than in the United States. A long leave is granted every three years, a short one in the summer. Realizing that this oil field, which it wouldn't sell for 0100,000,000, was dropped into its lap, the oil company has spared no expense to keep everybody happy, the British, the employees, the natives. It would be a paradise except for the isolation and the heat. At first, in exchange for complete co-operation, the company promised the British that fas soon as men could be trained, 90 per cent of the European employees would be British. Thus the government can, in part, save its face and eventually, perhaps, give the impression that Bahrein is a British/10. British development. Within a year only two or three Americans, top executives, will 'be there. it turns out that the company couldn't .keep Americans if it wanted to. Air conditioning, electric refrigerators, and country-club amusements are old stuff to them. They want to get out of the heat and hack to their friends. The British love it. A young Englishman at Bahrein told me, 'I'm going to ask for a renewal of my contract.when my three years are up. The heat is 'bad, 'but I'm living like an English millionaire. I had to come to an Arah desert to get air conditioning and plenty of ice and a tile 'bathroom,' The situation is dripping with political poison for the British. It is tremendously important that they keep face with the Arahs and it is difficult for them to explain why Americans could find oil where the English said there wasn 1 t any. England, for safety, must 'boss the Persian Gulf, for that T c a short route to India. It must have the friendship of the Arabs, who could cause a great deal of trouble if they joined the enemy in a war. England needs naval and air bases in that country. With the completion within a year of railroad lines in Iraq and Turkey and the installation of fast British ships in the Gulf, the Suez Canal route will have a real competitor. Passengers will be able to go from London to Bombay in less than ten days. England must be in a position to defend that route,and an American oil company in the middle of it complicates things. Britain's sloops have done a good job of chasing pirates and slavers out of the Gulf, its political agents work hard to keep the Arabs happy, and when sultans and sheiks visit London they are given a high old time. But, when the sheiks make/c $ $ 11. make a deal for oil now, they want the Americans in on it. Across the G-ulf is Iran (Persia) , which doesn't like the way England has taken charge of the Gulf. In 1925, smelling oil, Iran made a claim to the League of Nations that the G-ulf was 'ther private waters of Persia' and that Bahrein 'belonged to Iran* The League rejected the claim, 'but Iran still sulks ahout it and won't play post office with the British. Letters from Bahrein will not 'be delivered in Iran unless they have Iranian stamps on them. Passport visas for Bahrein are granted 'by the British, and if you have one you can't enter Iran except on special permit, for in recognizing Britain's 'unlawful 51 protectorate of Bahrein you stamp yourself, in Persian eyes, as an undesirahle citizen. In a few years there will no longer 'be 'big Fourth of July celebrations on Bahrein and no longer will there 'be such terrific complications as exist today when Texans and cockneys, 'both thinking they speak pure English, fail utterly to understand each other. The whole business will 'b.e run 'by the British. But the Americans won't care. They want no credit. They're satisfied with the profit from the oil.LA/ ^ Confidential* The j^ggidency, Bushire , tlie 28th Decein 'oer, 1938, T).0.&gt;T0&gt;777&gt;3 , Jill you please refer to enclosure to India Office Printed Letter Ho.

Everywhere else in the Arabian world there are children who carry loads, who work ten to fourteen hours daily at the looms, children who beg in the streets who with sores with mattery eyes sit in dirty courts. In Bahrain there are children that play. They go in their long white shirts or only in shorts happy to the sea and sail their self made boats, they are not oppressed or prematurely suffering, but erect dark brown little people. The budget is equalised: streets schools hospitals are being built, clean meat and fish markets arranged. One of the most important regulations is the strictly adhered to alcohol prohibition. In one of the newly well polished taxis of Manamah the journey goes southwards through the palm date groves which gradually beccrae more sparse until the last trees are relieved by the desert. Faultless black asphalt streets run like foreign bodies over the sparkling levels, autobuses flash by, taxis and elegant private carriages. Right and left hundreds of small hills loom up, sandy graves of vanished, unknown people. The sky is white from the accumulated moisture, the sun is disc in the mist - strikingly hot. The desert is yellow white. On the horizon loom up white blazing forms; the giant / mm*-2- giant silver painted benaine tanks. We are approaching the oil refineries: black trestles in front of a whitish sky, chimneys, towers, cooling plants and surrounding all this, wire netting. At the entrance a sentry, a policeman of Bahrain, wearing a dark red tasselled cap. J'rom the construction office one goes to the management office. This is not in the refinery, but a few kilo meters away in the living camp. Between the two there are cottages covered with foliage for the native v /orkers which are called coolies, perhaps because formerly the workers were from India.L'ORIENT ARA.BE agence de presse 39. rue soliman pacha telephone 56380 LE CAIRE I_ Li.1 oU- f ^ o'W o ' o ^ ' AL CHABAB' Cairo 14 .12 .38 P. &lt;3 3 '// Cairo's M Al Ghabab' published on the 14th December 1§38 the following item concerning Bahrain; M A Bahrain Arab notable writes to us severely criticizing the Bahrain 'Kadis' Shias and Sunnis who show no interest whatsoever to the unfortunate fate of Palestine.

The reasons of the dissolution of the Council are not yet known but we can be sure that the British had something to do with it. The Amir would not have taken such an important step unless he was sure of their help. The British did not like the Legislative Council and they particularly desapproved of two refoms: one tending to form students missions i^ Kuwait which would be sent to Iraqi schools the other consisting in the arrival in Kuwait of Iraki experts for administrative reorganization Kuwait populations show a string desire to annex their country to Iraq and the British are alarmed lest this annexion would happen, which ii/ould be very much against their interests.

(by the Special Correspondent of the Al-Nahar) In a previous number the Al-Nahar published a short account of incidents happening in Bahrain, namely the d demans of its population for a Legislative Assembly and lelf-Government. I have since received information from reliable sources to say that the National S'ront have repeated their demonstrations for the attainment of their legitimate rights. The news state that severe clashes have taken place between the demonstrators and the force in charge of law and order and that the Government have arrested the leaders of the movement who are of the best of the population and notables of Bahrain and imprisoned them in the Port a thing which strengthens the movement and stiffened the strike. public opinion is now seething against the British Advisor who has made himself a Dictator. The Advisor is the absolute ruler of that part of th?/country while the de facto Prince enjoys nothing save a nominal sway. This Advisor rules Bahrain with an iron hand inflicting the bitterest puniahment on her people, persecuting anybody who would think of arguing against the freedom of action that he assumes for himself. He has gone so far in this that matters have nov come to the highest pitch. The people of Bahrain therefore publicly express tneir anger at this treatment and demand their rights for self-government and would undergo all distress and incur any sacrifice. This/This Advisor has gone so far in his tyranny that he detained the telegrams the nationalists sent to the British Government London against the deeds of the authorities in Bahrain and demanded the grant of a legislative Assembly and self-government. We draw the attention of the British Government to the deeds of Advisor Belgrave which are not warranted by any law or good conscience and which remind us of the deeds of the British troops and their Oommanders in Palestine, and point out that the Arabs of Bahrain have seriously decided to obtain their rights whatever it may cost them in money and lives.L'ORIENT A.RABE AGENCE DE PRESSE 39. rue soliman pacha t^lfephone 56360 LE CAIRE _ Li-L oU- ^ jl^ T \ • it* ♦ CS o? ■ S * ^ISTIKLAL' ( Baghdad)' 15. 1. 39.- i&amp;cz&amp;be', &amp;e- (jo ybldll The following article signed ' An Inhabi tant of Kuwait' appeared in the 'Al Istiklal' of Baghdad in its issue of January 16th 1939• It was entitled % t h ' Kuwait and the Nejd' M The Principalty of Kuwait was formerly in the best of termes with the Nejd, as regards their mutual commercial interests.

During these 15 years, the Saudi Government made the greatest efforts to stop their doings. The roads linking the two states were closely watched and the smugglers caught red-handed severly punished. M hen a Legislative Assembly was formed in Kuwait the Government felt it tgieir first duty to resume their good relations with the Saudi Government. It is painful to admit that the latter did not seem to appreciate the goodwill of the Kuwait Assembly. The negotiations utterly failed, /e hear from well informed cercles that the main reason for this failure is that the customs tariff and the price of goods is very much out of peeping. For instance in 3audi Arabia the duty for one sack of sugar is equal to that of $0 sacks in Kuwait. Why does not the Saudi Govern ment lessen the burden of their subjects ?

The mail, telegrams and telephone calls are censured. Any newspaper daring to comment on^ the situation is forbidden in the Islands which an evil fate has placed under British rule. As to the Amir, he is not allowed to take a single move withput the British councellor's permission. The latter is showing the utmost severity in the trial of the nationalists and political prisonners. He seems anxious to equal in cruelty his Palestine colleagues. Lately, one of the political prisoner died at the Gitade as a consequence of the violences of the police. But the Britishers may well be as tyrannic as they want the nationalists will nevertheless fight to the end for the realization of their rightful claims. It is really regrettable that an Arab from Bahrain should help the Britishers in their assassination of the spitit of freedom and that he should take advantage of his position as Director of Education to propagate anti-national ideas among the students. He is also responsible for the backwardness of Education in Bahrain and is generally knwon as a spy.

Lately, one of the political prisoner died at the Citadel as a consequence of the violences of the police. But the Britishers may well be as tyrannic as they want the nationalists will nevertheless fight to the end for the realisation of their rightful claims. It is really regrettable that an Arab from Bahrain should help the Britishers in their assassination of the spitit of freedom and that he should take advantage of his position as Director of Education to propagate anti-national ideas among the students.

' as a result of the carelessness shown by the Arab Amirs of the Persian Gulf as regards the internal government of their states and the needs of the population, the foreigners have taken a prominent position in the Arab States, namely Kuwait and Bahrain. This foreign prominence is a great danger for Arab nationalism and the national life of the States. The Arabs have not yet for gotten the attempts made a few years ago by a foreign power to appropriate to itself the Bahrain Islands under the pretence that they belonged formerly to her. It succeeded however in taking part of the country. An interesting fact is that the foreign power does not ask for a consular visa to travel to Bahrain and Kuwait, thus implying that the two States already belong to her.

The constitution of a Legislative Assembly and self-government as regards internal questions are their main claims# They would like to set themselves free from British domination. The British authorities keep their position in the Persian Gulf by taking advantage of the hostilitji between the different principalties and princes. The latter are tied to Great-Britain by treaties which forbid them to sign any agreement with other countries, even arab countries, without Great- Britain's consent. The princes are thus kept under british authority and prevented from uniting. ' Youths of all the Arab countries would have given teir support to the youth of Bahrain should the latter have made the first step. It is also unfortunate that the supporters of Arab Causes should usually know so little about events in the Persian Gulf, Many times^ has the Iranian Government shown their political ambitions in Bahrain while it was impossible for this small country to face the danger. Every time, Great-Britain took apparently the defence of Bahrain while actually it was her own interests and the road to India she was defending. In Bahrain Great-Britain is always adavantaged to the expense of others.

Is an article entitled 'Kuwait' which begins with a A. brief desciption of the broadcasts about Kuwait, by the Baghdad Radio, and the propoganda for its annexation to Iraq. The writer quotes Iraq's assertion that it is 'Iraq's 15th Liwa' and that it should be rescued from the oppressions of the Amir, and from 'Colonization' and its T servants. Then the writer replies thus:- 'We, sons of the Gulf, look at Iraq with great respect, .(realization of) ' but we also look forward to/pur own ideals of complete Union, (of Gulf States), therefore, we regret the hostilities shown by some Iraqis towards Kuwait, and we hope that His Hashimite Majesty and his wise Government will put an end to this propoganda which has been put forward without previous thought to such points as the following':- * ' (1) Such aims will j|&gt;pvoke enimity between Saudi Arabia and -Lraq. Kuwait is looked upon by the Riyadh authorities as the port of Nejd and no less, if not more, important than T 0gair, yet E.M. King Abaul Aziz has forbidden his Govt, from interfereing with its affairs, and that-is in spite of what he «« imagine about the extent of smuggling from Kuwait. HeHe does all tiiat as a sacrifice for the sake of preservation of peace between the Arab States* Moreover the allegations that the Shaikh oppressed and enslaved tne people of Kuwait is false# There is no Amir, Sultan or King, who has helped his people as much as the Shaikh of Kuwait; (2) The 'Golonization' which iiti^Bagndad Radio) descibes A and bevails is not apparent in Kuwait^ The Amir himself manages all his internal affairs; we say this with full knowledge and are ready to challenge anybody who contradicts ito (3;— The Subah is an old Ruling family wnich through c^everses-s and bravery has founded a town and a people in a land barren of vegitation and water. It is more in the interest of the Arab Nation, States and Tribes, to be united and not to attack one another. (4) Neither is it strange that that the people of Kuwait should ask. for a legislative council, nore are other countries who have such councils are more enlightened than the Kuwaitis, but there is a difference between a legislative council and a council which combines in itself the three powers of legisla tion, Justice and execution® This has no prallel except in Russia. Therefore it is to be hoped that the honourable leaders of Ira -i, the pillars of progress and the hope of the future, will look at the matter from its real side® On the 3rd pa^e ;~ (1) Translation of an article written by Mr. Neville Chamberlain about himself, his ardous task as Premier, the help and encouragement which he recieves from Mrs. Chamberlain about his father and brother, Education, Morals and his advice to the British Nation. (2) Headed 'News of Arab ^outries n as follows (a) Iraq Budget , gives brief figures about the Iraq. Budge t. (b) Britisii treaty with Muscat ana Oman . The writer says that the treaty witn Muscat and Oman has been renewed because it expires on tne 15th of last month~ 3 - and says that the new treaty met witii much pleasure in Muscat because of the better terms which it contain^,that it makes the state free to impose taxes on nationals and foreigners alike, and that it is all due to the efforts of the Sultan with the Hon T ble the Political Resident and the autnorities in India and Englando Third page :- (1) several headings,of no importance,such as Radio news, help to Palestine refugees, a case of bigamy translated from English newspapers etQo (2) What is going: on in Kuwai t:- In tracing the origin of the Kuwait agitiation the writer says 'Kuwait,like otner Gulf States (with the exception of Bahrain which has some regulations),was mastered by lawlessn ess, without any regulations, while the Kuwaitis are the most enlightened and energetic amongstthe people of tne Gulf * Thier neighbourliness to Ira^. and the progress which tnat country has attained has its effect on them, while there was no sign of any improvements being introduced by the Government of Kuwait which has made the whole people of Kuwait, supported by some members of the Ruling family, to make a demand for a legislative council^ wnicn demand was granted by the Amir. But both sides forgot to bring a lawyer from Ira*, Syria or Egypt to frame Rules and Regulations for the legislative council, therefore their 'Eastoor has come out as one without prallel in any otner country, we do ! not say this to lower their dignity, but such a matter needs qualified^lawyers to frame properly so that xi each xiis party knows it bai«b4s. Tne writer then publishes a copy of the Charter granted by the Shaikh and after that makes the following- remarks:- It can be seen from these articles which were signed b7 o J the Amir, that the Majlis has assumed tne three powers of legislation, Justice and Execution and left the Amir with the feeling of having been told by them n sit down, you are the feeder and clother'. This is not a legislative council, but a parliament which is endowed with more power than tne British Parliament in democratic England. Naturally the result was aconflict with the Amir. He dissolvea the Majlis and ordered new elections and changed the 'Dastoor' into one drawn from that of Traasjordania, but the Majlis rejected it and high tensions are still going on between the Amir and the Members of the Majlis# 4th page :- This page contains a few advertisements, sto^press, a story from old Arabic books and a poem made in 1341 by IcJC Shaikh Hamad, whilest in India^addressed to nis father ifete Shaikh Isa.Translation of an article in the newspaper 'Baiirain' dated 23rd March 1939 about the Palestine Conference in London. THE PALESTINE OONFERSNQE . Prom whatever angle we view the matter, with an eye full of hope ana trust in the Justice of the British side (of the delegation), we do not find a wora which we can say except that the Conference is not a success. Yes, the British Government said that they have some otner suggestions which will be more satisfying to the demands of the Arabs, and which will be published shortly, but had these suggestions been serious and agreeable to the Arabs then there would have been no reason for the delegates to disperse. The matter may be the reverse. The Jews nave resolved to call on a general strike for last Monday wnich they have later posponed pending publication of the suggestions which, they hope, will be in their favour. As to the original suggestions, after which the Conference dispersed, and which Wfts rejected by the Arabs, these may be condensed as follows It speaks of a transition period, the time of which is not fixed, but which depends upon the extent of cooperation between the Arabs and Jews. During the period an executive council will be formed composed of British Officers^ Arab and Jewish representatives wno will be ministers without ministries, and an advisory council,representing the population proportion ately, which will take otfer the duties of Government under the supervision of the High ^omissioner. The constitution will,in the future, be formed by Palestine itself when it becomes g^par^^yft-t that both Arabs and Jews are working in harmony and friendship. The Jewish migration will be limited to 15,000 per annum for a period of five years after which the matter will be reviewed and Palestine will be divided into tnree zones. In the first the sale of lands will be allowed, and^the second the sales will be conditional, and in the third it will be forbidden, these are -the substances of the suggestions. If the independence of Palestine depends on the extent of peaceful cooperation between Arabs and Jews, and i4^3s^sasrsr seen to be working in afriendly- 2 - // manner, then the time for such an mdepenaence will never come ana the power will remain as it is, in the hands of the High Comissioner/f Is it for such a purpose that the ^rab delegates Have been invited ?, ana is it for such purpose that Palestine nave sacrificed tens of thousands ol its sons? It is unaerstooa that members of the delegation who were in tiie Sychelles are not permitted to enter Palestine, but the Nashashibi ana his party will go to Palestine to see their friends and relations, and to serve the country.CONFIDENTIAL The Adviser to the Bahrain Government presents his compliments to : H.

The article states that the situation Kuwait is very serious and pessimism is growing as a result of the Amir's hesitation to approve of the constitution. The Amir makes use of perpetual hesitation as a pretext and causes the Legislative Assembly to be unable to fulfill its duty. Armed forces watch night and day in the administrations builc buildings and the nationalists are submitted to small vexations. But the population of Kuwait keeps a very firm attitude which nothing seems to be able to alter. The Amir tries to make the population tired and to brihg the Legislative Assembly to give a general resignation. But up to now only one member resigned while the others seem prepared to fight. The popuiition will not let its rights be lessened. XKlt The general feeling is now that Kuwait is to be annexed to Iraq. The correspondent believes that if the present situation does not change many families from Kuwait will apply for the Iraqi nationality. 'A surprising fact, says the correspondent, is the attitude of King Ibn Saud towards Kuwait.

The party distributed pamphlets calling the population to rise and claim its rights. The shop owners of the town and workmen of the Petroleum Company went on a strike and marched in the streets by great number while speakers encouraged them. The aovernment of Bahrain wanted to restore peace and called for the help of the Colonial forces. In the riot several people were wounded, on both sides. The leaders of the opposition party were arrested. They aret Saadl Ben Chemlah, Ahmed El Jabarawl, Ibrahim Abu Kawal and All Ben Allfa. The population went on with the strike for several days and the authorities kept on arresting young men who are now enduring great sufferings in the prison. What the population claims Is the revocation of the British councillor to the Government of Bahrain, the constitu tion of a Legislative Assembly drawn up on the same line as that of Kuwait, the revocation of the Director of Sducatlon and the appointment of an Iraqi Director, further claims concern the Oil Company.

The Residency, Buahire, the 7th April, 1939, D.O.No.Sll-S .cU, ; would you please refer to my telegram No,217, dated the 6th April 1939, in which I asked for a copy of issues up to date of the new Bahrain newspaper, which you had not included with your letter Ho .c /l ' ated the 27th March 1939, nor not entirely satisfactory. While, if a Press already exists, even if it is not satisfactory one has to make the best of it, it does not seem to me to be of much use starting a paper which is not suitable. The original idea of the paper which Belgrave gave to me when I discussed it with him and you at Bahrain on my last visit, was that it was to be owned and run by the Bahrain Government. The present paper is, I see, privately edited and owned by a certain Abdullah bin Ali. There are of course certain advantages in this arrangement as the paper will carry more weight with the public than if it were a purely official publication. On the other hand, if Ali is ridden on too light a rein by Belgrave he may have to be pulled up with too sharp a jerk with resulting unpleasantness and possibly the suppression of the paper. 3, I think therefore that the Bahrain Government should exercise a pretty strict censorship over the paper, and that, for the present at any rate, nothing should appear in it which you think objectionable» even given its name I 2 # i gather from remarks in your letter that the paper is / 4. H. weightman Esquire, I.C.S,, Political Agent, Bahrain.-2- 4. If the paper is a success we could make it a useful §|il medium of publicity not only for Bahrain but for the other States of the Gulf. I note for instance in paragraph 33 of the Kuwait Intelligence Summary No.5 for the period from 1st to 15th March 1939 that one of its articles was well received in Kuwait# But publicity is a ticklish subject and must be handled carefully otherwise the last state is sometimes worse than the first. h r I V-, ■HHHH mm SMH ■HHiConfidential D.O.

It was very stupid of me to omit to give you the name of the paper. 2# I entirely agree with the remarks in paragraph 2 of your letter, and I was a little startled myself when the first number of this paper reached me. However on my talking over the matter with Belgrave I came to the same conclusion as yoU| that there would be advantages in allowing t'he paper to be the private possession of Abdullah bin Ali f provided that it is carefully censored. 3. The censorship eo.far has not been quite as full as I should like, but I find it hard to blame Belgrave as he has been overwhelmed again lately with work, ^yard, who should have been here last month, has apparently got some amoebic dysentery infection which has delayed him (and indeed I am not entirely sure that he will ever be able to come), and Belgrave also has part of the Customs v- r ork on his shoulders now as de Grenier is on leave. 4. I took considerable exception to an article in the issue of the 23rd March 1939 (the translation of which I received cjl^u after I had written my demi-official letter No. QJW1 dated the 27th Farch to you) headed 'The Palestine Conference'.

He is already sending a draft copy of each issue to Belgrave before publication and I am asking Belgrave to ensure that the drafts are examined and submitted to him at once# 5.

After dealing at length with the geographical conditions of Kuwait the author observes:' At present Iraq considers the case of Kuwait as similar to that of the Sudeten of Czechoslovakia• Kuwait is eagerly claimed by the Iraqi nation who feels that the inhabitants of the two countries are of the same blood, the same creed and the same ideals. The word ' Iraqi Sudeten' is seen daily in the Iraqi press.' Getting back to the end of the /orId tar the article reviews the succession of political events which lead to the present situation. ' Up to the last few months peace reigned In Kuwait. In the mean time Iraq grew ta&amp;tyi powerful and inspired by new feelings of racism set her eyes upon Kuwait. Kuwait is the best position of control over the port of Bassorah, Firther, the occupation of Kuwait would be for Iraq a compensation for last year's ' rectifications' of frontiers in the Chatt El Araba. The Iraqi government consider this case as an excellent derivative for public opinion from the internal difficulties. The Iraqi leaders of the annexion have spread in Kuwait the idea of e: participation of the population to the Amir's administratioh. The latter yielded to the wish of his people and at the beginning of last year formed a Consultative Assembly. The Assembly immediately adopted as agreesive and uncompromising attitude as could be. Of their own authority the members of the Assembly decided to banish some of the Amir's favourite friends and to engage ' Iraqi Technicians'. As a result, the Amir broke up the Assembly and asked for new elections to take place. The new elections brought back about the same elements. The new Assembly passed a resolution urging the application of certain alterations to the Constitution which in themselves were a step towards complete affiliation with Iraq. The Amir would not accept it but promoted a Constitution similar to that of ransjordaM. His idea was unanimously rejected by the Assembly. As a result, the A sem- bly will have to be broken up again and it is to be feared that troubles and riots will ensue. The sitaution is daily commented at the Iraqi radio and the press openly supports immediate occupation.of Kuwait. The position of the British, allied to both parties is particularly embarsssing/ Up to now the British tried only to 'moderate'. But one wonders if this can go on any longer ?'Tls Confidenti&amp;l.

An Arabic broadcast is now being heard from Berlin since the last few days. This makes all the Great owers (France, Britain, Germany and Italy) as broadcasting in Arabic. But, the matter which makes our skins shrink, and which makes us, we Arabs, shake with rage, is that each of these broadcasts has no other purpose than to detail the number of torturous and repressive measures imposed by the other in our country, and the opressions and punishments with which it treats the Arab countries whilest we listen to these barbarities which we had never know n or believed .

Yours sincerely, Sd.L.F. Rushbrook Williams R.T.Peel, Bsq.jM.C. India Office,S.W.I.P.Z.5180/39 Copy (F 3667/1/150) The Power of the Britiah Royal Iflavy * Many unsuoceaaful attempta have been made by ill- diapoaed peraona to write down the power and efficiency of the Royal fiavy. Such attempta were bound to fail, for they were not baaed on fact, and their allegationa and inain- uationa can ao eaaily be diaproved by anyone who carea to look at the facta for himaelf. To begin with, the total tonnage of ahipa in conmiaaion in the Royal Navy amounta to a figure approximately equal to the total tonnage of German, Italian and Japaneae fleeta combined. If it ia aaid that a percentage of thia tonnage ia over-age, auch a atatement meana little or nothing except in relation to the same percentage in other flfteta. In any case, a glance-at the recorda reveals the enormoua naval construction programme at present being completed in British shipyards, totalling on the 1st July, 1939, 712,000 tons of new construction - a figure far in exceaa of the conatruction put in hand by any other naval Power. A large number of theae new vessels is due to be launched and completed within ^the next few weeks and months. Consider the position in the current financial year 1939-40. Battleships . Two vessels of 35,000 tons with 14 11 guns of the 1936 programme H.M.3. King George V and H.M.3. Prince of Wales were launched early in 1939 and will be completed next year. Another /Another battle ship of the same class (of the 1937 programme) H.M.S. Duke of York will be launched by Her Majesty the ^ueen on September 16th. The two remaining 35,000 ton battleships of the 1937 programme H.M.S. Jellicoe and H.M.S. Beatty will be launched shortly after. Meanwhile the 30,000 ton battleship H.M.3.Warspite (with eight 15* guns) completed her modernisation in 1937 and has been entirely re-engined and re-boilered. Anti aircraft armour and protection were very greatly increased and hangars and catapults were added to enable her to accommodate three to four aircraft. / The same process of complete modernisation is being carried out on her sister ships H.M.S. Valiant (to be completed January, 1940) and Queen Elizabeth (to fee completed by the middle of 194c). Battle cruisers The complete modernisation of H.M.S. Repulse and H.M.S. K e nown, thirty knot battle cruisers of 32,000 tons t cqkr mounting 15* guns, has also been carried out. These vessels are to all intents and purposes new ships and it may be noted that on the modernisation of H.M.S. Renown as much as £3,088,008 was spent as compared with an original cost of £3,117,204. These two vessels form part, with the 42,000 ton battlecruiser H.M.S.Hood of the battlecruiser squadron of the Home Fleet. In addition to these new vessels the construction of four 40,000 ton battleships mounting 16 11 guns is progressing well# Air-craft Carriers. In April 1939 the 23,000 ton aircraft carrier H.M.Illustrious {of the 1936 programme) was launched and herher sister-ship in the same programme H«M.S.Vic torious will be launched on September 14th; both these ships will be completed next year. Of the two aircraft carriers of the same class laid down under the 1937 programme the 23,000 ton H.M.S..Formidable was launched by Lady Wood, wife of the Secretary of State for Air on August 17th and H.M.S.Indomitable is due to be launched early next year. The construction of two other aircraft carriers of the same tonnage is progressing. Cfcuisers . The last two of the ten 10,000 ton cruisers of the •SouthamptAn* class mounting 6 H guns H.M.S.Edinburgh and H.M.3.Belfast will have joined the fleet. Of the 8,000 ton cruisers of the ••Fiji 11 class mounting e* guns H.M.S.Fi.i i was launched in May this year, and H.M.S.m^eria and Mauritius in July; H.MS.Kenya was 1annohau on Au^ufit 18th by Her Toyal Highness the Duchess of Gloucester, and Trinidad i*5 dnc to be launched in September, Four further crulserB of the sane class H.M.S.

The ... 'Despotism of 'Rritisli Officers in Baiirain ' . A few years ago the condition of Bahrain btate was the other states situate in the Persian Gulf and it was administered by the late Shaikh Isa A1 Khalifa according to the tenets of Islam. But the people wore not satisfied with this Government owing to various defects and maladministration. In 1923 the British Government appointed Major Daly the Political Agent who introduced^number of changes and initiated a new regime. Major Daly (now Colonel Daly) is the Political Resident in Baroda State. He was^ also^ Political Agent in Iraq some time ago. Owing to his achievements he was so popular in Iraq will not 'be forgotten for centuries to come. The following are the changes which were ushered in the Government in his t ime: - i # Appointment of Ahmad (Hamad), the son of the old Shaikh Isa A1 Khalifa, as his successor. 2. Appointment of Mr. C.D. Bolgrave as Financial Adviser. 3. Establishment of Judicial and Religious Courts - also a Municipality and two Majlises: one entrusted with commercial affairs and the other with pear- trade . He had (artesian) wells bored and also arranged for the supply of water everywhere ,&amp;&amp;&amp; 'prior to that, water T. ! ao so scarce that one bag could hardly be obtained for a Rupee, He made roads and harbour for the facility of ships and boats. He constituted an Education Committee out of the local populace. The oil companies which are at present in Bahrain are all due to his efforts. He also reformed the family conditions of the Shaikh and sent his sons for education to Iraq. In a word, all the developments in existence at present in Bahrain are the out-come of his efforts and labours.(3^ Alas I the people of Bahrain were deprived of such an experienced administrator whom they still remember. After his departure the progress of Bahrain was greatly impeded and an era of deterioration and mal- administration set in. The people 'became dissatisfied with the maltreatment of the * Financial Adviser. It must be stated that fifter Major Daly's departure the Financial Adviser usurped absolute over the Government. He decides cases according to his own personal views: there is no need of law or necessity for consultation. If a man wants to transfer his case to another Majlis he is threatened with jail and fine. Men who have been appointed in Courts cannot write even a single sentence correctly and are absolutely devoid of the knowledge of law. Lack of common sense and experience is out of question. Once there were four cases of one nature but the Adviser awarded different punishments. He expunged the ' school committee and removed able and efficient teachers appointing in their stead people who had no interest in education. This caused a great commotion in Bahrain and the peoDle protested against this mischievous regime which was so detrimental to progress. Formerly in Bahrain Police there were all Arabs who were well conversant with the language of the place and its ways of life and used to perform their £ duties admirably. Peace and tranquility were the order of the day. But Mr. Belgrave replaced them with illiterate, rustic Iranis of the Persian Gulf who neither know a syllable of Arabic nor have an idea of civil life - who can neither readier write. Yet the Adviser decides the eirvfrk cases with Sh their advice. Before the flow of the oil springs of Bahrain, the Works Department was under the Director of the Land Registration Department. Since the flow of petrol and the increase of work the Government especially appointed an Engineer for this purpose. This Engineer does what he likes.Nobody can stand in his ws^. Nor is there any one to check his accounts or question his subordinates. Owing to this type of carelessness, embezzlement and malpractice are of eve ry day occurrence. All Revenue Departments used to present statements of their monthly income and expenditure under the general supervision of the Adviser and these were audited by an Iraqi engaged for 10 or 15 days on a nominal remuneration. Now for the same work he has appointed a man whose pay, apart from house rent and car allowance^is Rs.500/-. There was no need of this appointment because the revenue of the State which is collected from the poor by taxation is so ---- - insignificant W/can never bear the burden of such a large salary of an accountant. He also appointed another man whose monthly salary, in addition to house rent and car, is Rs.500/-, and who is the Manager of the Shaikh's property . This duty was formerly performed by an Arab whose pay was very small. Now this Manager's salary is Rs.18,000/- (sic) t&gt;er annum while the income of the property is only Rs.12,000 That is how the revenue suffers a deficit of Rs.e.OOO/- for no reason. The Electric Department , in spite of the partnership of Bahrain Municipality^ is unquestionably arbitrary and negligent. It recovers from the Municipality a few thousand Rupees every year for deficit withput giving any account or reason for the deficit. Besides this, all its officials are foreigners and the Bahrainis are not given any job except that of a coolie. The condition of Jail is deplorable. Thieves, judgment debtors, adulterers, gentlemen, loafers and political prisoners are all treated in the same manner. The task given to prisoners is extremely filthy and humiliating such as cleaning the roads, stable and latrines and drawing the cart, etc. The condition of food and clothing is unspeakable.4 The American oil companies are reaping colossal profits but the people of Bahrain know nothing about the^)t^O agreement and its future programme. All the officials of the Company are foreigners drawing thousands of Rupees per mensem but the Bahrainis are destined to nothings but Annas 8/- or 10/- per day. Looking at this state of affairs, the Bahrainis raised their voice against the Adviser but instead of improvements, the order was issued that no body should make a petition in the name of the people or seek an interview in this connection. Those who presented protests in the name of the nation were summoned under warrant and punished. The Bahrainis unanimously decided to send a delegation to His Highness Shaikh Ahmad (Hamad) and request him to devise means of removing this tyranny and high-handedness. When the Adviser heard it he issued warrants of arrest against the leaders and had them arrested. This caused agitation among people who all assembled and started asking the reason for arrest. The people who wanted nothing but justice and equitable treatment were fired at and charged with many were arrested^sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying between 3 and 6 months. Some ¥/ere deported for 2 years. Having completed their task the Adviser summoned the leaders to the Court and sentenced^first^Ali A1 Khalifa A1 Fazil to years* tigorous imprisonment and 2 i years deportation then condemned Sa'ad bin Shamlan to one year's rigorous imprisonment and one year's deportation and^ in the last^ awarded 11 months' rigorous imprisonment and 11 months' deportation against Ahmad Shirawi. These persons continued performing all kinds of low and filthy tasks in the Jail for 6 months. In the meantime, Ibn Saood, the King of Hejaz, came to Bahrain and, for the sake of justice and equity, intervened in the matter. Then the Adviser called them and informed them that the first person was to bedeported to Hejaz for 2% years and the other two for 6 X months each i« India. Al the three were accordingly given a their passports and tickets and taken straight from the jail to the ship even their families not 'being allowed J to see them. No arrangements were made for their future maintenance in spite of.the fact that they are sent to a country where they have no means of livelihood and the language of which they do not know. Let it fce known that the British officers are responsibi for this maladministration. They still persue the old policy and ideals and do not care for the welfare of the public simply in order to please one man. Being a friend of the parties and considering the present day world situation, I am forced to say that the policy persued 'by the British Officers is wrong and devastating. The time is gone when under one man's leadership thousands of men used to 'be subservient. How the world has chaged; the people have begun to understand their false or true leaders and do not acceot sxty man's leadership . Por fh a few years the Italian and German propaganda against British interests has been in progress in this countryJ It is not known whether the British officers are aware of it or not. Look at the condition of the other states in the Persian Gulf. The present interneci^p warfare # among the ruling families of Gulf State^was never heard of before. This is all due to Italian and German propaganda and the careless-ness of British officers. The people of Bahrain are very simple and loyal to the British Govern ment; they only demand livelihood from the Government. I hope my voice will not prove to be 'crying in the wilderness' and that the British Government will first of / all^provide for the maintenance of the deportees and then contrive a solution of the difficulties and that, in view of the present state of affairs and in order to safeguard its own interests and welfare, will take a serious viewmaggmrnrn Confidential No. C/660-2/4 The Political Ageat, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to; — The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document ( s ) with the request that the Police might see if anyone of this name can be traced and if so to let him have the man 1 s local history. 1 T he A gency, BAHRAIN, P ersian G ulf.

A ivriter had published an article in an Egyptian weekly nasazino signed by 'A sad Bahrain^,(but the Bahrainis disown him#) If we look carefully into what he wrote we will find that he is a false teller who wanted to spoil the names of the leaders of Bahrain who are struggling for obtaining their rights and the rights of their unfortunate country which is suffering from British colonization. We are astonished how such a magazine vrtiich calls i»tself an Arab paper publishes such an article which is not only a British propaganda but it is also an article by which the writer wished to praise Mr. Belgrare and to show that he is a blessing 'to? Bahrain and that if he is not there the country would have lived a miserable life under its own Amirs. Wkte The writer who is an employee of the Bahrain Govern- laent wished to make adulation and give preference to the British rule over that of the national rule. He attacked all the newspapers which published the facts about Bahrain, especially 'Alsejil' and its editor who is well known for his free principles and his services to the Arab cause and Islam# Ee attacked the leaders of the Bahrain movement with words v&amp;iich we do not like to mention in our paper. You the writer who wants to defend the Adviser, Mr. Belgrave, what a blind heart you have gotM The tyrany of the Adviser is quite clear and all the inhabitants of Bahrain,big and small, are dissatisfied with him. The writer said that he wonders how the editor of 'Al- 3ejil tt believed persons whom he did not know and is not aware of their purposes. On our side we would ask the Pro- in turn preitor of that weekly magazine/how he came to know you. Yes, he came to know you through the colonists and through your open propaganda for the British v/hich is the most im portant principle of that magazine.Numbers of that magazine have been sent to many respectable persons in Bahrain as a present from the Political Agency in Bahrain but all were refused end returned to the Proprietor. Bahrain problem has been published in many impor tant Arabic newspapers which are known for their patriotic efforts such as M Ai Shoura'Rabita Al Arabia' ^Al Fateh' and n Al Sejil w , The readers know about the British actions in Bahrain and their colonial objects. They know thier Irregular methods by which they force people to submit to their control, 7/e would say to Mr, Belerave; if he is displeased with what are published about his despotism he should abstain from such actions and regard the rights of the country. The nonsense proi&gt;aganda (which he makes) will on the contrary be of no effect,. The Arabs of today are not those Arabs laftiom the English had known before the War. A committee has been formed under the name of committee for helping Palestine sufferers. It is presided by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa All£h-lifah, Abdul- azis Al All Al Bassam is the treasurer and Abdullah al Proprietor of AlBabrain paper Zayed/is the Secretary. The committee consists of 32 members all of merchants and notables of Bahrain, The public had been invited at a general meeting at the Cinema compound. Pecans were read and speeches delivered, &gt;■« the They expressed the feeling of Bahrain towards/Arab cause. The Go-operation and feeling of Bahrain towards the sufferers of Palestine was legible. The contribution list has been opened and the contributions to this day , of £.1,000/- reached Pjj , .£0 f 000/-. The first payment/had been maie sent to the President of Muslim Youths in Cairo, Dr.3?r. Abdul Eamid Saeod. The balance will follow# The Bahrain Government promised to contribute two folds of any amount that can be collected provided that the English should send the amounts to the High Commissioner of Palestine• The committee refused this proposal• The Amir of Bahrain wanted to contribute, but he was prevented and threatend by the English. A dispute took place between the President of the committee and the British Consul. The Consul protested that the contributions are sent to the warriors, but the committee said that they are sent to the orphans and widows# j ehmmTranslation of an article appearing in the Egyptian Weekly^^^ '^Bafr-at-al-Sharq'. BAHRAIN . I am very sorry and much pained by the false ibws which I read in newspapers ahout my country# News which is as far away from the truth as the heavens from the earth, and which are written by persons vihos^purpose in life is to satisfy their beastly desires. Their object by spreading such fabricated news is to stir up peaceful and quiet minds and to disturb the peace. If a right minded person thinks a little about these false reports he would by himself find out the truth and would scoff at their writers who, instead of revealing to the world the real progress and quick improvements of iheir country, go on writing articles which are offensive not only to its fair name but to the nane s of its Just and sincere rulers who are zealously devoted to the welfare of the country and who themselves hold most of the High Offices such as that of Educational Minister, President of the Chamber of Commerce and other such high positions which clearly show their devotion, competence and good administrative power through which they keep themselves well aquainted with most of the affairs of the Stateo From the above it becomes clear that what was said about Mr. Belgrave as being despotic in the administration of the Government is utterly untrue • Mro Belgrave needsno introduc tion because he is well known to the people of Bahrain for his sincerity, intelligence and good administration. He is wakeful for the interests of the country and listens to old and young alike. His sole purpose is the upliftment of the country towards progress, improvements and civilisation; and in doing so he respects the interests of individuals and parties alike. He rescues the oppressed and punishes the oppressor, and never becomes weary or tired. It is as if Cod has made him a mercy for the country. Readers of the hk newspaper Al-Sijil saw that its editor devotes a large space to writings which are horrible to - / • • . * *,4 ' 2 - ^ to all right-minded and sincere persons, 'because he alleges that among us are leaders who have/le adership and whom we do not recognise as such. He says that the Police arrested the lawyer Ahmed al Ghirawi without a reason; is there any reason in saying that the Police have arrested an innocent person who did not commit any crime ? By what right was he called a lawyer ? What kind of Diploma did he possess and from what college did he emerge ? He further says that Sa'ad bin Shamlan, who is of a negroid origin, was tried and imprisoned without a crime being proved against him* Is it within reason to say that a man is sent to prison without committing a crime ? As for Ali bin Khalifah al Padhil; he led a childish agitation and organised a demonstration against the Government without any justification; a demonstration which was not put down by arms, as our friend the editor of al-Sijil puts it, but by the wisdom and high intelligence of the Commandant of Police, helped by the anger of the general public against the demonstrator^and their hated leader. The writer went on to say that they were tried by Mr. Belgrave which allegation is utterly false, and the truth is that they were tried by the magistrates of the Courts^who are members of the al Khalifa family, in the presence cf a number of persons. Their guilt was completely proved in accordance with their own confession^to the Court^which was heard by all those present. If my good readers want to know who these persons are, I would say that they were idlers without any occupation. They were hated by old and young alike; because of their repeated crimes. They only resorted to organise this agitation and rob when they realized that their tricks to 6heat/the public are not bringing them the gain which they expected. These are their deedsl I am surprised how the editor of al Sijil gives credence to persons whom he did not know and of whose objects he is ignorant, and how he goes on writing all the childishl h - 3 • stories and satanic lies which they sajo He stigmatizes Bahrain with leaders who know nothing of life except their own beastly desires, and he writes about matters of which he is ignorant. We request him to investigate before he defiles his paper with such articles and thus impair# his fair name by believing such myths* Be it known to those who are ignorant of the truth that it would be better if they ask those who knew® 'A sorrowful Bahrain!'i /yekr A.P. A. Re. last two paras of the article. Shaikh Abdullah sent the first collection of money to Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa in Alexandria for transmission to the person named in the article. On enquiries being made from the British Embassy, Cairo, it was learnt that Dr. Abdul Hamid Saeed was not a desirable person to receive such subscriptions. P.a. informed Shaikh Abdullah of this and reminded him of the existence of the Arab Womens Committee in Jerusalem to whom further subscriptions should be sent. As will be seen from P.A ! s draft d.o. below suspicion exists that the Editor of 'Al Bahrain' is probably one of Yunus Bahri's correspondents. Yunus Bahri is the individual who broadcasts the Apabic news from Berlin. The Editor may be corresponding with others also and the present article might be of his own composition. /U /5 /f/of /f-d o 1-^-. ^ ^ i•—c i v —t., ? ^ 71^. /'-.f- jo</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000391_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/178</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000391</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/178</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Articles in Press on Gulf Affairs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1938/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-04-17T13:21:27</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (362 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.
