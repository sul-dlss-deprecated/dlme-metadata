Captain Knox recommends that he be allowed first to endeavour to get dheith Mobarek no let him have for noth ing and enclose a strip of the foreshore in cuestion 200 yards long by 50 yards deep. If heget a free gift of it as waste ground he anticipates than he will be able to get it for Rs 1,000/- but recommends that he be given dis cretion to give anything the bheihh may fix up to the ordinary marbet rate of 5 dollars per Lira, at which rate the price would, according to his calculation, worlc out at about Rs 5,500/ -. It would I thinh be preferable to jay for the ground and get the usual transfer document for it than to get the plot as a gift, perhaps no be repudiated by Lheibh Mobar- eb’s successor, and I consequently recommend that the Political Agent be authorised to purchase as cheaply as he can within the limit of Rs “,500/- suggested by him. r.

I am sorry the expression exercised you. I did not mean anything very legal, but simply that we should have some correspondence with, or letter to or from Sheikh Mo- barek on record in which the measurements and boundaries of the plot would be mentioned and the fact made apparent that it was obtained in the ordinary business way. A gift, unless it was a formal one in writing by the Sheikh might be revocable by his posterity whereas if we have it on record that we paid something for the ground, there can be no difficulty afterwards. I quite agree that it would be folly to alarm Mobarek with any unusual formality over the acquisition of the plot. What you suggest will do very well. h i Captain S. G.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my office endorsement To: 8GG dated 11th April 1006, I have the honour to forward, for your information, a para phrase of Foreign Department Telegram To: S. G2 dated 1st September 1006 on the subject of the acquisition of the foreshore of Bunder Shwaikh. 2. I am inclined to think that my coming over to Koweit for the express purpose of discussing this matter with Sheikh Mobarek might give the question an importance in his eyes which would perhaps militate against our easy acquisition of the plot; and I ha.ve no doubt that the terms of the Foreign Department Telegram under reference are intended to cover discussion by yourself. Unless therefore you see reason to differ from me on this point and would prefer me to come over, I shall be glad if you will take up the matter with 'Sheikh Mobarek at the first suitable opportunity telling him if necessary that you are authorised to do so. G. If you can acquire the ground outright at a reason- ab ly fair market rate and think that the delay entailed by a further reference to Eushire and India would involve risk of Sheikh Mobarek changing his mind, you would be warranted in closing the bargain provisionally subject to the final approval of Government. If on the other hand SheikhJL2S-— © Siieikh Mobarek will not Bell outright and the conditions on which he would let us acquire the site on some other basis have to be referred to the government of India, it is important that his terms should be precisely formulated. You will I know do your utmost to get him to come to a satisfactory arrangement. I have the honour to be Sir, /our most obedient servant. Political President in the Persian Pulf.

I am a little doubtful of the advisability of o. broaching the subject with the Sheikh just as he was leaving for the Shatt-el-Arab fearing lest it should occur to him to discuss the subject during his absence with persons who may put unfavourable ideas into his headf but this fear may be groundless and in any case I have no doubt that he would have required some days to consider the cuestion.

Sir, . ^t 1 I am commanded by .fy Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to forward herewith for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council co£y of a letter which has been addressed to one Indian Government by the Commander-in-Chief on the Last Indies Station stating his views regarding the possibilities of .Lurein and Lathama as terminal stations for a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian f^ulf. 2. Their T /ordship’s views are not wholly in accord with those of the Commander-in-Chief regarding ‘the hydrographic and Commercial considerations involved. Jurein Harbour, as shown in Chart Kb: '571 possesses the foilowing advantages:- (a) . A wharf a mile in length, or a series of smaller wharves of that length, coula be constructed with depths of not less than 25 feet alongside at low water (b) . A judicious arrangement of beacons would enable a vessel to use a channel to this wharf of a depth of not less than 14 feet of water at low water springs, of 21 feet at high water neaps, and 24 feet at high water springs. (c) . The depth of this chajmel in would not be dif ficult to increase to 20 feet at low water springs, and it is possible even greater depth could be obtain ed at some cost. (d) . The berths alongside the wharf would be perfectly secure at all times. (e) . A railway could run down to the wharf, and pas sengers ana goods be embarked or disembarked without aelay. A rough idea of what is meant is shown on the attached cuttingcutting from Chart ro: '571. Vith regard to Kathama it is uo be observed (a) . That a depth of 20 feet at low water is about -f mile or upwards from uhe shore. (b) . That it would be a much more expensive work to construct a wharf, alongside which vessels could moor at Jiathama than at Kurein. (c) . There would be however plenty of room for vessels to anchor in an area of '0 feet depth and upwards at low water, about a mile off shore. 4. The whole tendency of traffic in the present day is to bring vessels alongside wharves, or into floating docks with railway communication alongside; so that trans-ship ment to small vessels, lighters, or boats is avoided, and it is specially necessary to study the convenience of passengers. 5. The question of the expense of fitting a terminal port for traffic is small in comparison with the expense of a railway, and the advantage of a railway is greatly reduced if a convenient terminal port cannot be construct ed. Such a convenient terminal port could be made at Kurein at probably a very much less cost than at hathama. G. In placing the above considerations before the Secre tary of State, -ly Lords do not wish it to be understood that they advocate the construction of a harbour either at % Kurein or Kathama, at the present moment. This is a question of policy which involves much wider issues. As however the subject is engaging uhe attention of the Government of India, . Ir. , lor ley may think it desirable that they should be in possession of the facts set forth above which are material to a full consideration of the Question. I am etc. , (sd). LVAK ilACLK.KOLCaptain raher:- To ask the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, whether he has any information regarding the extension of nhe Konia Baghdad Railway to Khor Abdullah which lies on the sea to the northeast of Koweit in the Persian kilf; whether there is good anchorage at Khor Abdullah 8 to 10 fathoms deep within - r '00 yards of a bluff solid enough to bear the terminus of a great Railway; and whether the British fleet has sur veyed Khor Abdullah which belongs to the Sheikh, of Koweit.

Following telegrams repeated for your information. The first to the Sect; of State July 7th • Begins • Your telegram of 26th of June Koweit foreshore. Cox reported on Feb; 10tx A that Lubarak is willing to let us havo a strip of fore shore wherever we like to select it measuring 600 yards in length by 100 in depth • This would give us best site in neighbourhood of Shweil roadstead. Sheikh is willing to sell outright but would prefer a yearly quitrent. Knox suggests our first offer should be Rs 50,000 as sale price or Rs 2400 as quit rent in alternative. He anticipates however that Mubarak will probably demand very much more as he is quite aware of the potential value of the land and may run to demand of Rs 2,00,000 down or Rs 10,000 quit-rent. Major Cox thinks we might offer up to Rs 15,000 per annum of which portion might be treated as subsidy.

First Assistant to the Resident and His Britannic Majesty s Consul-Geneial in the Persian Gulf (in charge current duties). I have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, copies, with translations, of the proposed draft agreement by Sheikh Mubarak to lease to the British Government the land to the south of the Bunder Shweikh and of the draft agreement by myself accepting the conditions on behalf of the British Govern ment. 2. It is unfortunate that Sheikh Mubarak should hesitate to sign the agree ment in question without receiving a duly authorised acceptance in form from myself but to press the point too firmly would only excite greater suspicion and might imperil the success of the negotiations. 3. I have been solemnly assured by Sheikh Mubarak that he will affix his signature, witnessed by his son, Sheikh Jabir, to the document, as soon as I am ready to give him a document duly signed by myself accepting the conditions to which he has agreed. 4. It will be impossible for him to plead ignorance of the agreement, as it has been prepared finally by his own confidential secretary and, in the preliminary stages was read over letter by letter and discussed most carefully between us. The Arabic draft remains, of course, in my personal custody. I trust that the notes appended by me to the translation together with the quasi-telegraphic despatch sent by me in haste to you last mail will show fully the course the negotiations have taken. 5. With regard to the form of the accepting agreement, I venture to hope that it will be allowed to stand in the main, though verbal alterations here and there can be inserted, as Sheikh Mubarak has not yet been told what form this letter will take. It would, I think, allay a good deal of suspicion, if I am authorised, on the part of Government, to give some assurance that it is not the wish of Government to interfere in Koweit except for the laudable, harmless motives, mentioned in the accepting agreement and that the Government wishes to see the Sheikh of Koweit powerful, independent and beholden to nobody. 6. I shall make one more effort to obtain in writing from Sheikh Mubarak the assurance made verbally and detailed in paragraph 3 above. If, however, l fail I would recommend that I may be authorised to accept in the form indicated and I would urge that it is extremely important that there should be as little delay as possible in what, I venture to hope, may be the final stage of the negoti ations. 7. A more formal acceptance, signed either by the Resident or higher authority, as the wisdom of Government may direct, might follow in due course, if it should be considered advisable. A 8. I think I may safely say that, while Sheikh Mubarak hesitates to com mit himself, he and his son, Sheikh Jabir, are both delighted at the course events have taken, less I believe on account of the actual profit to them over the deal, C380FDthan because they take it to be an indication of a strong policy for the future and an assurance that the railway from Baghdad to the sea will be in the hands of the English and that the terminus will be at Bunder Shweikh. 9. 1 am forced, at the moment of closing the mails to reopen this letter, as the Sheikh’s letter, in which he admitted in writing to me that the draft agreement met with his approval, introduced conditions foreign to the actual lease and especially a dangerously ambiguous clause relating to Customs. I promptly visited the Sheikh, but found that he would not consent to treating the customs as a separate matter and his especial fear was that, as soon as we had got the Shweikh lands into our hands, we should say to him—“ Yes, you can take customs dues in your town and w'e will take them within our limits.” I assured him that Government had no intention whatever of taking customs dues and pointed out to him that the clause, as it stood, would allow him or his successors, in a mo ment of displeasure, to enhance customs dues to such an extent as to kill trade and render our concession nugatory. 10. We then agreed to submit to the wisdom of Government the following ge eral principle to be enunciated in the agreement accepting Sheikh Mubarak’s offer to lease, viz., that Government, on their part, agree not to collect customs dues within the boundaries of Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarak, on his part, binds himself to furnish a customs schedule whth a percentage rate based on present day rates, as taken from his own subjects, to be applicable to all British subjects or British Indian subjects or other subjects of His Gracious Majesty, the King-Emperor, and that the rates are not to be increased without the con sent of both parties. 11. I am fully conscious of the inconvenience of introducing a customs regulation in 4 o the middle of a lease, but to have insisted on its exclusion would have roused Sheikh Mubarak’s suspicions to such an extent as would have im perilled the whole course of the negotiations. Of itself, it would appear to me that the fixing of a regular customs rate on British and British Indian subjects is a distinct advantage, for, although the customs rate is higher than it used to be in Koweit, it compares favourably with the old Ottoman rate of 8 per cent, or the Persian rates and is, on the whole, favourable, and it will be extremely useful that it should not be altered except with our consent. 12. Sheikh Mubarak also implied that he required the letter of acceptance from Government, by which he means a letter signed by myself duly empowered in that behalf, should also follow closely and in detail the agreement to lease, signed by himself. There appears to be no objection to this course. 13. I am compelled, therefore, with much misgiving and regret, to suggest that I should be empowered to do the best I can in the circumstances and to give to Sheikh Mubarak a letter w'hich should follow closely, viutatis mutandis, (1) the agreement to lease, (2) the form suggested in paragraph 5 above, and (3) the general principle, enunciated in paragraph 10 above and in Sheikh Mubarak’s letter of which I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy and translation in duplicate.

After asking after your dear heart, afterwards, with reference to the paper which comprehends the detailed boundaries in the lands of Shw'eikh and the lease as mentioned in the paper which I gave to Major Knox and of which a copy is with me, I am accepting everything that is mentioned therein. Then, if the precious Imperial English Government approves in their exalted sight that'T'^ '»■— '*kr'r~w w - - ~ ~ 3BBS9''■MHMtali^ - 3 {agreement), then I also ask for a paper, following that one in detail from the Government which shall remain in my hand and also it shall be detailed in the paper given by the Government that my town is to me and its boundaries like wise and all my arrangements remain in my hand in the matter of customs, etc., and all my arrangements at the present day to me and to my heirs after me and, in the matter of the Shweikh lands and of the lands which the Government may, in the future, rent from me, the Government is to be bound in the paper that they will not take customs on anything in all the lands which they may rent or in which they dwell within the limits of Koweit. As for the customs of Koweit, its arrangements are in my hands and to my heirs after me and there shall be an arrangement for the customs dues from the subjects of the Government. I mean, English merchants and people of India and other than them of the subjects of Government, by agreement between all— I mean me, Sheikh Mubarak and the Government—we will make a regulation of fees at some settled rate per centum and we will arrange them now according to my arrangements of the present day, on my subjects and, after it, there shall be no increase except by the consent of the two parties with the supervision of the Government and, for the explanation of my demands, I have sent this letter and the presentation of the circumstances to the Government is upon you and may you remain safe. Dated u Rajab 1325 H. = 2ist August 1907. Seal of SHEIKH MUBARAK. (True translation) S. G. KNOX, Major, Political Agent, Tt anslation oj the draft agreement, not yet signed, showing progress of the negotiations. In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of myself and on behalf of my heirs to Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Koweit, on behalf of the English Government. The reason of writing this paper is that I, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, have leased in perpetuity to the English Government the land of which the boundaries are detailed below south of Bunder Shweikh. First .—The boundary of the land on the north-west shall be 7,500 cubits in length in a straight line and situated in it the coal house which I, Sheikh Mubarak, have constructed in these days in the aforesaid land and the straight line shall march, as far as possible, corresponding with the sea line but, apart from these two conditions, it shall be lawful to the English Government to draw this direct north-western boundary at their choice and pleasure. And, secondly, the eastern side and the western side shall be each 600 cubits long and the southern side shall be 7,500 cubits long and the whole land shall be rectangular : and, of this land, there shall be to me, Sheikh Mubarak, of it a plot on the north-western side of which shall be the coal house aforesaid, the four sides of which shall be each ,300 cubits long, the total 1,200 cubits long (apart from the dimensions of the coal house) 1 and opposite the house, I mean the coal house, to the north-west shall belong to me, Sheikh Mubarak. Secondly.— r Y\\z rent of the land aforesaid shall be counted at Rs. 4 per cubit yearly which shall flow from the day that this paper duly agreed, signed and sealed, shall pass between the hands of the two parties and the rent shall be paid yearly in advance. Thirdly ,—In explanation of the preceding paragraph, the aforesaid lands are embraced by one line, the length of which is 16,200 cubits. (Without the mea surements of the house), * the remainder is 15,000 cubits and the rent of theland according to this line amounts to Rs. 60,000 which will be paid to me, Sheikh Mubarak, or to my heirs in advance yearly, as long as the British Gov ernment desires the aforesaid land. Fourthly. —There is included in the aforesaid rent, without other rent or demand of any kind, the right to all land, above ground or under sea, between the two sides, the east and the west, produced in the north-west direction to three fathoms of sea water at the time of the lowest low tide (opposite the north western boundary) 3 and it is lawful for the English Government to build and construct between the aforesaid limits any building of any kind, coal sheds, harbour works, etcetera. And also it is lawful for the aforesaid Government to put down buoys and do all work needful for the ease of the ships from the open sea to the Bunder. And also it is lawful for the English Government that they should lease the lands in part or in whole for a fixed term of years or in perpetuity to the English subjects or to the subjects of “ British India,” 1 mean, the people of India, or to the subjects of me, Sheikh Mubarak, I mean, the people of Koweit, at their perfect will and pleasure. Fifthly. —And further, in consideration of the rent detailed, I, Sheikh Mubarak, confirm on my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs, my former promise that neither I nor my heirs will grant, sell or lease to a foreign Government and in this is included the Ottoman Government or to the subjects of any Foreign Gov* ernment any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it without the permission of the precious English Government. Sixthly. —-And also I, Sheikh Mubarak, and my heirs, am bound in this paper that we will give to the English Government the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of the lands detailed below :— Firstly. —The lands which lie adjacent to the lands detailed at a distance of 2,000 cubits in any direction from the nearest boundary of the leased lands but to my subjects, the people of Koweit, to them shall be a right of pre-emption stronger and prior to that of the English Government in this special land. Secondly. —The entire island of Shweikh 4 and its surrounding foreshore. Thirdly. —All the lands and the foreshore in the direction of Ras Kathama to a distance of two sea miles, 1 mean 8,000 cubits in any direction from Ras Kathama ; if the Government should have any desire in that place, then it will be on lease separate from the lands of Shweikh at a rent 5 that shall please me and there shall be to me a house near the house of the Government, should the Government desire (the land) and the house, which shall be to me, shall be a square, each side 300 cubits, the total 1,200 cubits ; and to my subjects also land (which ig 00t ”^ 3 r e 8 d — the desire of Government) 6 and, if it should be neces sary, I will leave to the Government a road to the sea, within my limits the breadth of which shall not be less than 10 cubits. Seventhly. —In explanation of the preceding paragraph, that it may not be concealed, whenever any soever may come and desire to buy or to take on lease the lands detailed in the 6th paragraph either in part or the whole, every time before that I, Sheikh Mubarak, or my heirs accept the offer of the buyer or of the lessee 7 it behoves, and is incumbent on, me, Sheikh Mubarak, or by heirs that we should inform the Agent of the English Govern ment in Koweit or the Consul-General of the precious English Government in Bushire, and we will give to the aforesaid friend a perfect opportunity, not less than 3 months, that he may consult higher authority and decide whether the English Government wishes to buy or take on lease the aforesaid lands or no. Eighthly. —If the opinion of the English Government is fixed on the purchase or lease of the lands - ^auaeJ' accordance with the offer and condi- tions of the purchaser or lessee, the offer of the English Government will be accepted without talk or further demand 5 and the demanded lands will be sold or leased to the aforesaid English Government on these conditions 8 and I, Sheikh Mubarak, have accepted this rent especially from the preciousImperial English Government and, as for others than it, I would not accept from among all the Powers though they give me more than this rent, I will. not allow them to possess authority in my dominions and, as for the precious English Government, I am grateful to it and its generosity is upon me {and, as long as / experience their kindness, and ajter me, my sons, then I am as I have men tioned in this paper) and I will not consent that a Government other than them of the Governments shall interfere, though they will give me more than this rent and I hope, please God, that this graciousness to me from the precious Imperial English Government will endure to me and to my heirs after me and (I hope for) the permanence of their care and kindness. Notes by Political Agent. x i.e., We are not to deduct the dimensions of the coal house, say iod cubits in circumference, and give the Sheikh 1,100 cubits. It is to be a clear 1,200 cubits (north-west side 300 cubits) in which the coal house is to be placed somewhere, preferably at Sheikh Mubarak’s option. 2 Coal house and compound. 3 The object of the insertion of these words is to show that our boundary follows the three fathom line and is not a direct line drawn between the three fathom points at the extremities of the east and west sides produced- A sketch showing the waving 3-lathom line was given by me to Sheikh Mubarak in the course of these negotiations 4 There are existing fishing rights here granted by a previous Sheikh to a section of the “ ’Awazim.” 5 The ambiguity here will be noticed between the two 5s , but the mean ing is fairly clear. Sheikh Mubarak will not sell but only lease his rights in Kathama. This destroys value of the ready acceptance of an offer of sale but, to avoid suspicion and discussion, l was compelled to let it stand. 6 Part of another of Sheikh Mubarak’s interpolations. It seems harmless but obscure. A better Arabic scholar than myself may understand exactly what is meant, but I do not understand how land can “adjoin” or “ not oppose ” a desire nor exactly what is meant by the “ desire of the British Government.” The explanation given to me is “any land that the British Government don’t want.” 7 Would be lessee. Arabic word means “wishing to hire.” *viz.&gt; conditions on which the would-be buyer or lessee was walling to take the land. The words in italics and between brackets seemed to me impossible to accept, as they would make the lease a lease on sufferance. These words were twice inserted by Sheikh Mubarak but, in the afternoon of the 19th August, he eventually consented to their omission. In the same afternoon, he told me that he objected to the signing of the agreement, but that he would enclose the draft copied out fairly by his ow r n secretary wath a covering letter in wffiich he w r ould say that he approved the draft and would exchange it for a letter of acceptance signed by me, as soon as I w r as fully authorised to accept. There seemed to be no reasonable objection to this course, so I agreed. The draft, duly copied out, with the objectionable words omitted was handed by the Sheikh’s Secretary Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, to my Moolla Abdulla who brought it to me on the morning of the 20th August. There was, however, no covering letter and I am endeavouring to obtain one. A slight addition was made to 6th, secondly, “ only the fishing nets are to me, Sheikh Mubarak.” 1 hese fish nets or w r eirs are, from their nature, con fined to the broad shallow flats to the east, north and north-west of the island.Should it be used for a quarantine station, it would' be necessary to buy out the fishermen which would probably be done cheaply enough. Other wise from the point of view of harbour works, the fishing nets do not obstruct and might well be let alone. Translation of proposed draft acceptance of Sheikh Mubarak's agreement to lease Bunder Shweikh foreshore. In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government in Koweiton behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to Sheikh Mubarak-us Subah, ruler of Koweit. And afterwards the reason of writing this paper is that I, Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government and by permission from it granted for this affair specially, there has come between my hands from Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, a lease of the lands to the south of Shweikh Bunder dated the day of 1325 H., corresponding to the day of in the year 1907, A D,, ana 1 , Major Knox, on the part of the precious Imperial English Government, have accepted all the conditions detailed in the aforesaid lease ; and, regarding what Sheikh Mubarak has written in the close of that lease that he hopes for the permanence of the case of the Government and its kindness on him and his heirs after him, the precious Imperial English Government has honoured me with the permission that I may inform Sheikh Mubarak, on behalf of the precious Imperial Government, that the Government does not wish to interfere in the affairs of Koweit except for the profit of its (Koweit ) people and the increase of trade and knowledge and friendship between the English Government and the people of Koweit and, as regards Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah and his heirs after him (the Government) does not desire to see in Koweit a ruler other than them ever and the perpetual desire of the Government is that it should not seethe Sheikh of Koweit other than strong, independent and not beholden to any one whatever and that the friendship and agreement between the Government and the Sheikhs of Koweit may be perpetual.r“\ /( A/o // £&gt; 'y b- {*Jk OL*- &amp;C^7 'C i'^^xsV c c le.dL No. i^t, dated Bushirej the 25th August (received 2nd September) 1907.

It is unfortunate that Sheikh Mubarak should hesitate to sien the a^ree- mentun quesfon without receivmg a duly authorised acceptance in form from mysel but to press the point too firmly would only excite greater suspicion and might imperil the success of the negotiations. ^ 3. I Have been solemnly assured by Sheikh Mubarak that he will affix his signature, witnessed by his son Sheikh Jabir, to the document, as soon as 1 am which he® as agre&lt; a d d ° CUmem dU 7 S ‘ gned by mySelf acce P tin g the conditions to 4 - It will be impossible for him to plead ignorance of the agreement, as it has been prepared finally by h.s own confidential secretary and, in ?he preliminary s ages was read over letter by letter and discussed most carefully between us. ihe Arabic draft remains, of course, in my personal custody. I trust that the notes appended by me to the translation together with the quasi-telegraphic despatch, sent by me in haste to you last mail will show fully the course the negotiations have taken. i 4 P; x ) lth re § ard t0 the for m of the accepting agreement, I venture to hope that it will be allowed to stand in the main, though verbal alterations here and there can be inserted, as Sheikh Mubarak has not yet been told what form this letter will take. It would I think, allay a good deal of suspicion, if I am authorised, on the part of Government, to give some assurance that it is not the wish oi Government to interfere in Koweit except for the laudable harmless motives mentioned in the accepting agreement and that the Government wishes to see the Sheikh of Koweit powerful, independent and beholden to nobody. 6. I shall make one more effort to obtain in writing from Sheikh Mubarak the assurance made verbally and detailed in paragraph 3 above. If, however I iail I would recommend that I may be authorised to accept in the form indicated and 1 would urge that it is extremely important that there should be as little delay as possible in wnat, I venture to hope, may be the final stage of the negoti ations. &amp; 7. A more formal acceptance, signed either by ihe Resident or higher authority, as the wisdom of Government may direct, might follow in due course, 11 it should be considered advisable. L2 8. I think I may safely say that, while Sheikh Mubarak hesitates to com mit himself, he and his son, Sheikh Jabir, are both delighted at the course events have taken, less 1 believe on account of the actual profit to them over the deal, than because they take it to be an indication of a strong policy for the future and an assurance that the railway from Baghdad to the sea will be in the hands of the English and that the terminus will be at Bunder Shweikh. 9. 1 am forced, at the moment of closing the mails to reopen this letter, as the Sheikh’s letter, in which he admitted in writing to me that the draft agreement met with his approval, introduced conditions foreign to the actual lease and especially a dangerously ambiguous clause relating to Customs. I promptly visited the Sheikh, but found that he would not consent to treating the customs as a separate matter and his especial fear was that, as soon as we had got the Shweikh lands into our hands, we should say to him—“ Yes, you cam take customs dues in your town and we will take them within our limits.” I assured him that Government had no intention whatever of taking customs dues and pointed out to him that the clause, as it stood, would allow him or his successors, in a mo ment of displeasure, to enhance customs dues to such an extent as to kill trade and render our concession nugatory. 10. We then agreed to submit to the wisdom of Government the following general principle to be enunciated in the agreement accepting Sheikh Mubarak’s offer to lease, viz., that Government, on their part, agree not to collect customs dues within the boundaries of Koweit and that Sheikh Mubarak, on his part, binds himself to furnish a customs schedule with a percentage rate based on present day rates, as taken from his own subjects, to be applicable to all British subjects or British Indian subjects or other subjects of His Gracious Majesty, the King-Emperor, and that the rates are not to be increased without the con sent of both parties. 11. I am fully conscious of the inconvenience of introducing a customs regulation into the middle of a lease, but to have insisted on its exclusion would have roused Sheikh Mubarak’s suspicions to such an extent as would have im perilled the whole course of the negotiations. Of itself, it would appear to me that the fixing of a regular customs rate on British and British Indian subjects is a distinct advantage, for, although the customs rate is higher than it used to be in Koweit, it compares favourably with the old Ottoman rate of 8 per cent, or the Persian rates and is, on the whole, favourable, and it will be extremely useful that it should not be altered except with our consent. 12. Sheikh Mubarak also implied that he required the letter of acceptance from Government, by which he means a letter signed by myself duly empowered in that behalf, should also follow closely and in detail the agreement to lease, signed by himself. There appears to be no objection to this course. 13. I am compelled, therefore, with much misgiving and regret, to suggest that I should be empowered to do the best I can in the circumstances and to give to Sheikh Mubarak a letter which should follow closely, mutatis mutandis, (1) the agreement to lease, (2) the form suggested in paragraph 5 above, and (3) the general principle, enunciated in paragraph 10 above and in Sheikh Mubarak’s letter of which I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy and translation in duplicate.

Translation of the draft agreement, not yet signed, showing progress of the negotiations. In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, on behalf of myself and on behalf of my heirs to Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Kovveit, on behalf of the English Government. The reason of writing this paper is that 1 , Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, have leased in perpetuity to the English Government the land of which the boundaries are detailed below south of Bunder Shweikh. First .—The boundary of the land on the north-west shall be 7,500 cubits in length in a straight line and situated in it the coal house which I, Sheikh Mubarak, have constructed in these days in the aforesaid land and the straight line shall march, as far as possible, corresponding with the sea line but, apart from these two conditions, it shall be lawful to the English Government to draw this direct north-western boundary at their choice and pleasure. And, secondly, the eastern side and the western side shall be each 600 cubits long and the southern side shall be 7,500 cubits long and the whole land shall be rectangular : and, of this land, there shall be to me, Sheikh Mubarak, of it a4 plot on the north-western side of which shall be the coal house aforesaid, the four sides of which shall be each 300 cubits long, the total 1,200 cubits long (apart from the dimensions of the coal house)' and opposite the house, 1 mean the coal house, to the north-west shall belong to me, She.ikh Mubarak. Secondly. —The rent of the land aforesaid shall be counted at Rs. 4 per cubit yearly which shall flow from the day that this paper duly agreed, signed and sealed, shall come into the hands of the two parties and the rent shall be paid yearly in advance. Thirdly, —In explanation of the preceding paragraph, the aforesaid lands are embraced by one line, the length of which is 16,200 cubits. Deducting from it the line of 1,200 cubits (apart from the measurements of the house) a , the remainder is 15,000 cubits and the rent of the land according to this line amounts to Rs. 60.000 which will be paid to me, Sheikh Mubarak, or to my heirs in advance yearly, as long as the British Government desires the aforesaid land. Fourthly.—Thare. is included in the aforesaid rent, without other rent or demand of any kind, the right to all land, above ground or under sea, between the two sides, the east and the west, produced in the north-west direction to three fathoms of sea water at the time of the lowest low tide (opposite the north western boundary) 3 and it is lawful for the English Government to build and construct between the aforesaid limits any building of any kind, coal sheds, harbour works, etcetera. And also it is lawful for the aforesaid Government to put down huoys and do all work needful for the ease of the ships from the open sea to the Bunder. And also it is lawful for the English Government that they should lease the lands in part or in whole for a fixed term of years or in perpetuity to the English subjects or to the subjects of “ British India,” I mean, the people of India, or to the subjects of me, Sheikh Mubarak, I mean, the people of Koweit, at their perfect will and pleasure. Fifthly. —And further, in consideration of the rent detailed, I, Sheikh Mubarak, confirm on my own behalf and on behalf of my heirs, my former promise that neither I nor my heirs will grant, sell or lease to a foreign Government and in this is included the Ottoman Government or to the subjects of any Foreign Gov ernment any of our land within Koweit boundaries or around it without the permission of the precious English Government. Sixthly. —And also I, Sheikh Mubarak, and my heirs, am bound in this paper that we will give to the English Government the right of pre-emption in sale or lease of the lands detailed below :— Firstly. —The lands which lie adjacent to the lands detailed at a distance of 2.000 cubits in any direction from the nearest boundary of the leased lands, but to my subjects, the people of Koweit, to them shall be a right of pre-emption stronger and prior to that of the English Government in this special land. Secondly .—The entire island of Shweikh 4 and its surrounding foreshore. Thirdly .—All the lands and the foreshore in the direction of Ras Kathama to a distance of two sea miles, I mean 8,000 cubits in any direction from Ras Kathama ; if the Government should have any desire in that place, I mean Kath ama, then it will be on lease separate from the lands of Shweikh at a rent 5 that shall please me and there shall be to me a house near the house of the Govern ment, should the Government desire (the land) and the house, which shall be to me, shall be a square, each side 300 cubits, the total 1,200 cubits ; and to my subjects also land (which u not - 0 — the desire of Government) 6 and, if it should be necesary, I will leave to the Government a road to the sea, within my limits the breadth of which shall not be less than 10 cubits. Seventhly —In explanation of the preceding paragraph, that it may not be concealed, whenever any soever may come and desire to buy or to take on lease the lands detailed in the 6th paragraph either in part or the whole, every time before that I, Sheikh Mubarak, or my heirs accept the offer of theX ' eV ■ rearms ’ r buyer or of the lessee 7 it behoves, and is incumbent on, me, Sheikh Mubarak, or by heirs that we should inform the Agent of the English Govern ment in Koweit or the Consul-General of the precious English Government in Bushire, and we will give to the aforesaid friend a perfect opportunity, not less than 3 months, that he may consult higher authority and decide whether the English Government wishes to buy or take on lease the aforesaid lands or no. Eighthly .—If the opinion of the English Government is fixed on the purchase or lease of the lands in accordance with the offer and condi tions of the purchaser or lessee, the offer of the English Government will be accepted without talk or further demand 5 and the demanded lands will be sold or leased to the aforesaid English Government on these conditions 8 and I, Sheikh Mubarak, have accepted this rent particularly for the precious Imperial English Government and, as for others than it, I would not accept from among all the Powers though they give me more than this rent, I will not allow them to possess authority in my dominions and, as for the precious English Government, I am grateful to it and its generosity is upon me {and, as long as / experience their kindness, and after me, my sons, then 1 am as / have men~ tioned in this paper) and I will not consent that a Government other than them of the Governments shall interfere, though they will give me more than this rent and I hope, please God, that this graciousness to me from the precious Imperial English Government will endure to me and to my heirs after me and (I hope for) the permanence of their favourable notice and kindness. Notes by Political Agent. x i.e., We are not to deduct the dimensions of the coal house, say ioo cubits in circumference, and give the Sheikh i,ioo cubits. It is to be a clear !,200 cubits (north-west side 300 cubits) in which the coal house is to be placed somewhere, preferably at Sheikh Mubarak’s option. 2 Coal house and compound. 8 The object of the insertion of these words is to show that our boundary follows the three fathom line and is not a direct line drawn between the three fathom points at the extremities of the east and west sides produced- A sketch showing the waving 3-fathom line was given by me to Sheikh Mubarak in the course of these negotiations. 4 There are existing fishing rights here granted by a previous Sheikh to a section of the “ ’Awazim.” 5 The ambiguity here will be noticed between the two 5 s., but the mean ing is fairly clear. Sheikh Mubarak will not sell but only lease his rights in Kathama. This destroys value of the ready acceptance of an offer of sale but, to avoid suspicion and discussion, I was compelled to let it stand. 6 Part of another of Sheikh Mubarak’s interpolations. It seems harmless but obscure. A better Arabic scholar than myself may understand exactly what is meant, but I do not understand how land can “ adjoin ” or “ not oppose ” a desire nor exactly what is meant by the “ desire of the British Government.” The explanation given to me is “ any land that the British Government don’t want.” 7 Would-be lessee. Arabic word means u wishing to hire.” ^viz., conditions take the land. on which the would-be buyer or lessee was willing toThe words in italics and between brackets seemed to me impossible to accept, as they would make the lease a lease on sufferance. These words were twice inserted by Sheikh Mubarak but, in the afternoon of the 19th August, he eventually consented to their omission. In the same afternoon, he told me that he objected to the signing of the agreement, but that he would enclose the draft copied out fairly by his own secretary with a covering letter in which he would say that he approved the draft and would exchange it for a letter of acceptance signed by me” as soon as I was fully authorised to accept. There seemed to be no reasonable objection to this course, so I agreed. The draft, duly copied out, with the objectionable words omitted was handed by the Sheikh’s Secretary Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, to my Moolla Abdulla who brought it to me on the morning of the 20th August. There was, however, no covering letter and 1 am endeavouring to obtain one. A slight addition was made to sixthly, secondly, “ only the fishing nets are to me, Sheikh Mubarak.” These fish nets or weirs are, from their nature, con fined to the broad shallow flats to the east, north and north-west of the island. Should it be used for a quarantine station, it would be necessary to buy out the fishermen which would probably be done cheaply enough. Other wise from the point of view of harbour works, the fishing nets do not obstruct and might well be let alone. Translation of proposed draft acceptance of Sheikh Mubarak's agreement to lease Bunder Shweikh foreshore. In the name of God, the Exalted. This agreement is from me, Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government in Koweit on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit. And afterwards the reason of writing this paper is that I, Major Knox, Political Agent of the precious Imperial English Government at Koweit on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government and by permission from it granted for this affair specially, there has come into my hands from Mubarak-us-Subah, ruler of Koweit, a lease of the lands to the south of Shweikh Bunder dated the day of ^ 1325 H., corresponding to the day of in the year 1907, A.D,, and 1 , Major Knox, on the part of the precious Imperial English Government, have accepted all the conditions detailed in the aforesaid lease ; and, regarding what Sheikh Mubarak has written in the close of that lease that he hopes for the favourable notice of the Government and its kindness on him and his heirs after him, the precious Imperial English Government has honoured me with the permission that I may inform Sheikh Mubarak, on behalf of the precious Imperial Government, that the Government does not wish to interfere in the affairs of Koweit except for the profit of its (Koweit) people and the increase of trade and knowledge and friendship between the English Government and the people of Koweit and, as regards Sheikh Mubarak-us-Subah and his heirs after him (the Government) does not desire to see in Koweit a ruler other than them ever and the perpetual desire of the Government is that it should not see the Sheikh of Koweit other than strong, independent and not beholden to any one whatever and that the friendship and agreement between the Government and the Sheikhs of Koweit may be perpetual.(P).

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your office endorsements Nos. 1918 and 1929 of 1907, dated respectively the 3rd and 4th September, under cover of which were forwarded the following telegrams :— (1) Telegram No. 515. dated 23rd August, from the First Assistant Resi- \^Y 3 dent, Persian Gulf, to Foreign, Simla, and Resident, Shiraz. (2) Telegram No. S.—407, dated 29th August 1907, from Foreign, Simla, to Resident. (3) Telegram No. 28, dated 3rd September 1907, from Resident, Shiraz, to First Assistant Resident, Bushire. (4) Telegram No. 29, dated 3rd September 1907, from Resident, Shiraz, to First Assistant Resident, Bushire. 2. With reference to telegram No. 28, dated 3rd September K07, J have the honour to report that your message was delivered to Sheikh Mubarak, who seemed grateful and replied that he quite realized the delay involved in con sulting His Majesty’s Government. 3. I also informed Sheikh Mubarak that the Government of India desired full information regarding present customs rates. The Sheikh promised to let me know what rate he would decide to levy, before he left, as he proposes to do during the week, for the Shatt-ul-Arab. He promised, in this connection, to bear in mind the axiom that it was better, in his own interests, to levy light duties on a number of packages than to take heavy rates on a few. 4. I carefully avoided any mention of controversial matters, such as the arms trade, and think that there is nothing that it is more important to avoid all mention of; Sheikh Mubarak would take refuge in an indignant denial that arms were imported and nothing but bitterness would be introduced by even the slightest hint in that direction. 5. As regards telegram No. 29, dated the 3rd September 1907, I venture to hope that it will not be difficult to introduce the condition that the Sheikh should be guided to a reasonable extent by the friendly advice of the British Government or their representative. But I also think that it would be possible to conclude a customs regulation in the following way. We would first settle the terms of the lease and the acceptance, introducing the general principle of customs regulation, already quoted in my previous despatches and refer ring for further information to a customs regulation to be signed by Sheikh Mubarak, on the part of himself and his heirs, and by myself on behalf of the British Government. Such signature should precede the signature of the lease and acceptance. 6. While on this matter of the customs regulation I would say that I have made detailed enquiries in the matter of the levy of customs at 'present rates. The rates are not in any way uniform and some questions are involved regarding the landing charges. It would be very useful to me, if I could have the benefit of the advice of a British merchant, Mr. Lyle of Basra, for choice, during these negotiations. No special suspicion would be caused by his2 deputation and the fact that we were openly discussing customs arrangements with Sheikh Mubarak would discreetly veil the real object in view. I have every hope that we should find Sheikh Mubarak ready to meet us half-way and that the customs matter would he placed, at least on paper, on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. It would be essential, in that case, that I should be given full authority to conclude both agreements without further reference to the best of my ability. My efforts would then be concentrated in the endeavour to obtain, as far as possible, a uniform rate on ail goods—a percentage, which, I think, could he settled at 5 per cent or less on the value, as shown by invoices, irrespective of the value of the goods in the local market. In the event of invoices sus- ^ pected false, three methods suggest themselves as feasible— (1) Customs to buy at 25 per cent excess of invoice value. (2) Customs to buy at their own rate at which they have assessed. (3) Arbitration by nominees of both parties with referee to be appointed by the Sheikh. The choice of method should he left to the merchant. 7. I would respectfully subscribe to your views on the slave question. 8. With reference to Turkey, I could perhaps arrange to delete the present allusion to Turkey that exists in the draft agreement, but it will be difficult and give rise to the impression that we are afraid of that Power. 9. I would earnestly deprecate any further allusion to Turkey whatever. Undoubtedly the guarantee that the Sheikh is pressing for is that we shall not take his country from him. The idea of protection against foreign or Turkish aggression is not present to his mind in this connection at all : and cautious non-committing declarations as to our policy in the event of outside claims will only be interpreted by the crude -Ayab mind, ever prone to think evil of others, to mean that, at the first hint of danger, we shall leave him in the lurch. 10. I venture to hope that it will not, be difficult to include Warba island within the circle of pre-emption, but I fear that the fixing of prices at present will delay the agreement indefinitely. I find myself in some difficulty to decide what ar. uments I am to use to induce the Sheikh to tie himself down now to a price w hich we are not compelled to purchase at. As it was, though I have not mentioned this fact hitherto, I was forced to some extent to stiffen mv back to acquire the whole of the Shweikh concession. The Sheikh even went so far as to offer a material reduction in the price, if we would content ourselves with half the foreshore. I believe he offered to lease at half the rate per cubit. I mention this now to show that the Sheikh is not too eager to sell and that he confidently anticipates a large rise in the value of the lands adjacent to the railway, wherever it may run, and that he hopes to share in the profit. A fortiori, he will be still less disposed to tie himself down to a price at which we are not hound to buy. 11. It would be possible to commence negotiations for the fixing of the price, as soon as the original agreement has been signed and our position would be only slightly weaker. 12. Another view which tends to complicate the negotiations still further is that the Sheikh will probably have a decided preference for Shweikh or Has Kathama as the railway terminus. These positions would only tend to disturb slightly the vested interests in Koweit towm. It would be with very different feelings that be w r ould view a settlement at Warba. He would feel that we should be considerably more independent of his washes at that distance, and that even if he should resolve on the heroic measure of moving his entire town somewhere in that direction, he would only be exposing himself more fully to the danger « f Turkish aggression. The line that I anticipate he would wish the negotiations#to follow would be that, while he w r ould part on reasonable terms with his rights in Warba to prevent a foreign settlement there, he would require a guarantee from the British Government that, if the future terminus lay in their hands, they would do their best io bring the line to Koweit. Ai Vi - l - -* 1 ' ■ — ■ * • - •13. Further, it occurs to me as probable that the Sheikh will regard the inclusion of Warba in the pre-emption circle as confirmatory evidence of his right to that island and that he might possibly offer to throw in Umm Gasar and Sefwan village to boot. I presume that, in that case, my best couis© would be to represent that this would involve a further reference to Govern ment on a controversial point and deprecate its submission at this juncture, pointing out to the Sheikh that he would always be at liberty to extend the circle of pre-emption later, if he thought fit. It. I have dwelt on this matter of W arba at some length, as I wished to show that there are many considerations involved, and I would be the last person to s»y that I have been able to exhaust all the various objections in a couple of paragraphs. 1 am not at all convinced that it would not be better, purely from a local point of view, to postpone the vV arba concession, until the question of the price of the Kathama lands is ripe for presentation, and that the line for me to take would be to press for economical rates for Warba as a mere thorn in the side of our opponents, while all our and Sheikh Mubarak’s endeavours would be concentrated on the bringing of the railway to Ixoweit someway beyond Turkish ken.

Sheikh Mubarak also informed me that he might have occasion to approach Government with a view to the temporary raising of the customs rate in emergencies, when he should be in urgent need of money. ^ I ventured to assure him that he might be certain of a patient and sympathetic hearing.

As regards the specific points raised in your letter, I am to state that in so far as concerns the inclusion of Ttarba Island among the lands in respect of which prior rights are secured. Sir I. Grey is disposed to think that, in view of the investigations now proceeding a 5 t&amp; the ownership of the island, this provision may prove a useful addition to the agreement; while the undertaking contained in clause 9 respecting the town of Koweit and its bound aries doe# not appear to Sir I. . Grep to differ materially from, and at any rate not to go beyond, the assurance to the Sheikh authorised in Lord George Hamilton’s tele gram of October 1902 to the Government of India.

I attach extracts referred to for your* information, also a copy of what seems to me to bo a more lucid translation of the particular article of the agreement with which we are concerned. It seems clear that we can select our quasi-rectangle of foreshore in any position we please so long as it contains the Bheihh’s enclave on or rather in its seaward frontage. The Bheikh’s coal shed, again, may fall anywhere he chooses inside his enclave or, practically speaking, on the seaward edge of it. In order to select the site of our rectangle all that is needed is to have a card with a space to scale cut out of the centre, having the measurements of our rectangle, and to shift it to left or ri^it on the Chart to the position which experts consider best, subject to the proviso that the Sheilas enclave (the general position of which is now determined by his having built his coal shed) falls within it.

Dear Bill, Latest reports just before closing the mail. Moo&amp;a Abdulla took the amended agreement up to the Sheikh by request and the Sheikh had ir read over and over to him with a map of the same kind as I send you now which I prepared for him. He made a few verbal alterations. The land in Kathama could only be hired at a rent that would satisfy the Sheikh, the Sheikh^ house compound at Kathama would be enclo sed by 600 yards instead of 500 yards and a curious interpola tion, the 150 yards N.W. boundary of Sheikh ilubare^s resery vation is to be exclusive of the coal house dimensions. 1 boggled at this a bit as it upsets the symmetry of the plan but I dont see that it really affects the concession. xx xxx Yours sincerely, S.G. Knox, (sd) XxXxx&amp;hx.r paaw I ' f Secret. From Political Agent, Koweit. To First Assistant in charge current duties, Bushire. Demi official dated 14th August 1907. Turn that Bunder Shweikh negotiations are taking is better than I expected. Sheikh Mubarek has taken the pearl out of the oyster for himself by reserving the coal house recently erected with surrounding compound 150 yards square, coal house occupying the centre of the North west or seaside. Apart from thfct reservation he grants us rectangular plot of ground 3750 yards X 300 yards at a perpetual rent of If 60,000 per annum paid in advance. The North west boundary 3750 yards long in a direct line and roughly parallel to foreshore but must contain coal house or compound. Subject to these two conditions, position is at our option. Rent gives right without further demand to all foreshore to depth of 3 fathoms at lowest spring tide between N.E. and S.W. bound aries produced to N.W. except immediately in front of Mobarek^ reservation^ and full liberty to erect buildings of any kind, to sublet to British, British Indian and Koweit subjects, to put down buoys and carry out all work necessary to ease passage of steamers from open sea to harbour Shweikh. As area of land now granted is more than 12 times that originally asked for, rent is proportionally one third of Cox limit and I strongly recommend I should be empowered to accept at once without further question. Koweit subjects right of preemption or prior lease is stronger than ours to the land surrounding present concession to distance of 1000 yards from any point of our boundary but otherwise Government has precedence over all comers with regard to such land. Government has absolute right of preemption or prior lease to entire island of Shweikh and its foreshore (also called on chart Karaim). Government has absolute right of preemption or prior Ras Kathama lease to HKkixexiBixRdxBfxShwBikh and its foreshore to limit of 2 nautical miles in any direction but Sheikh reserves to himself land for house within boundaries of total linear length of 600 (six hundredhundred) yards somewhereat his option near Ras Kathama but \ r 0 grant a right of way to sea to Government 15 feet broad, if such is found necessary. Kathama land can only be leased* Conces sion also contains clause dictated by Sheikh asserting spirited dEE£ declaration of independence and Sheikh Mubarek f s deter mination not to part with his rights in land to any Foreign Government including Turkey or to their subjects without consent of British Government asked for and granted. Agreement is termin able at option of British Government only. Sheikh Mubarek also binds his heirs but his signature only holds good for two months.

From— MAJOR P. Z. COX, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Department l'tter^ No. i2io-E.A. f dated 24th July 1909, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the Public Works Department, on the subject of the projected coal depbt at Koweit. 2. It will be understood that it was inconvenient that the somewhat difficult questions of, firstly, the delimitation of the precise limits of our Concession and, secondly, the selection of the most convenient point within it for the location of a coal depot, should be gone into on the spot just as a change of Political Agents was imminent. Hence Major Knox’s reply to the late Assistant Engineer Mr. Laffbre. As soon, however, as Captain Shakespear had settled down, the matter was taken up and the Senior Naval Officer was requested to be good enough to depute one of His Majesty’s Ships, when a convenient opportunity offered, to ( 1 ) Political Agent, Koweit, to Resident, No 414 . make a survey of the foreshore of Bunder dated zsth July j 909 . f Kr rt p , Shweikh in consultation with the Political (a) Senior Naval Officer to Resident, No. P.-2, n n/r c' .r t • nr* dated 5th August 1909, with enclosure and sur/ey Agent. H.M.o. EapWing, Lieutenant' P ,an * Commander Mac Lean, was in due course deputed for the work, and I am now able to submit the results in the form of the communications and accompaniments marginally-cited. 3. The position to start with is briefly this. Our Concession must contain the Sheikh’s which must contain the Sheikh’s coal-shed, which was already built, on precisely what proves to be the most desirable spot on the whole foreshore, before the negotiations commenced. Our selection of ground, therefore, must be within certain preliminary limits, determined by the position of the Sheikh’s shed. Within these limits there seems to be no practical doubt as to which will he the most convenient spot for our coal depot. The selection of the best site of our Concession, however, is obviously a problem of great moment, and I have no doubt the Government of India will decide to refer the question with the H.M.S. “ Lapwing’s ” survey, to His Majesty's Government for decision under the advice of the Admiralty. 4. It was found by the Political Agent and Lieutenant-Commander MacLean in the course of the present operations that the English text of the Second Clause of the first condition of the agreement, as rendered by Major Knox in the translation forwarded with his letter No. 551, dated 16th October 1907, was incapable of practical interpretation on the ground, and on reference to the vernacular original and to certain demi-official explanations written to the Residency by Major Knox while the negotiations were in progress, it became C) Demi-official comm.nica.ioo t,om Poiitieal evident t0 me his translation needed Agent, Koweit, to First Assistant Resident, dated amendment.

If I may be pardoned for making a simple suggestion. In order to realise readily on the survey plan the limits of our sphere of selection, it is convenient to cut out of the centre of a piece of card a rectangle showing the size of our Concession, drawn to the scale of the Survey; then one can see the limits of the field of choice for the location of our Concession compatible with the retention of the Sheikh’s enclave in or on its seaward face. I say on, because it will be remembered that everything to seaward between the prolonga tion of the side boundaries, up to the 3 fathom line, goes with the Concession. Sent separately./ !/ u 2 6. Assuming, as I believe to be the case, that the views of the two officers concerned as to \he best site for the coal depot, as contained in their present reports, are based on a correct interpretation of the Agreement, 1 see no reason to differ from them, and therefore, if opportunity offers, I think no harm will be done, while time will be saved, if the Assistant Engineer makes his preliminary estimates on the provisional supposition that the site now recommended is the one which will ultimately be decided upon. In the meanwhile, I beg that the larger question may be subjected to expert examination as soon as practicable. r-s No. 414, dated Koweit, the 28th July 1909. From —Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I. A., Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence regarding the location of a coal-depot at this port ending with this office letter No. 39, dated the 22nd January 1908. 2. The arrival of a launch for this Agency having made the matter of sto rage of coal for her use one of some urgent necessity, I have the honour to ad dress you on the two much more important subjects upon which this matter will depend for settlement, vis., the exact situation of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore concession leased from Sheikh Mubarak in October 1907, and the institution and location of a properly equipped coal depot. 3. A reference to the lease Agreement forwarded with mv predecessor’s letter No. 551, dated the 16th October r.07, shows that the British Government has the option of so se’ecting its ground that a rectangle 7,500 cubits by 600 cubits (3,750 yards by 300 yards) may be taken up anywhere along the Bunder Shweikh foreshore with the following reservations :— (&lt;7) That the long seaward boundary of the rectangle shall lie through the existing coal-shed belonging to the Sheikh. (b) That this long side shall also correspond with “ the sea-line ” (pre sumably high-water mark / as far as is consistent with its being a perfectly straight line. (c) That the rectangle shall extend only 600 cubits (300 yards) in depth from this line for the landward boundary. (d) That in the rectangle on the seaward side there shall be an enclave a square of 300 cubits (150 yards) side, the property of the Sheikh. (e) That in this square shall be situated the Sheikh existing coal-shed, though the actual area of the coal-shed is excluded from that of the square. The British Government is further entitled to aU ground above or below water contained between the prolongations of the two short (east and west) sides of the rectangle as far as the three-fathom line at low water springs, excluding that portion contained between the prolongations of the east and west sides of the Sheikh’s enclave. The British Government has also the right to lay buoys and navigation marks anywhere in Koweit territory and to Duild jetties, coal- sheds, etc , within the limits defined above. 4. To obtain full advantage of this Concession, I presume as fundamental that that portion of the harbour should be secured which will give the maximum area of deep water necessary for a good anchorage near enough to the shore to enable possible piers and wharf-walls to be constructed without abnormal expen diture owing to distance and heavy work. 5. From a reference to the plan supplied by H.M.S. “ Lapw ing’s” recent surveys, it will be seen that the Sheikh’s existing coal-shed occupies the best possible site along the whole foreshore, the three and four-fathom lines beingonly 100 and 150 yards distant respectively from the high-water mark, within a few feet of which the shed stands. On both sides of the Sheikh’s coal-shed, the three-fathom line gradually draws further and further away from high-water mark until, at a point 1,600 yards east of the Sheikh’s shed, it is 400 yards from high- water mark and, taking a sharp bend to the north, narrows the deep-water chan nel and gives a large area of the haroour rear the town only 2 fathoms or less water. On the westward the same gradual receding takes place for 1,100 yards from the Sheikh’s shed, and the three-fathom line is then 300 yards distant from high-water mark; for the next 1,000 yards to the west there is slightly less water with the three-fathom line averaging about 500 yards distant from high-water mark ; further west still, the deep-water (i e, % anything more than three-fathoms) again narrows and the end of the harbour is reached. Along nearly the whole length of the foreshore, the bottom appears to be solid dead coral rock with mud and sand covering it in varying shallow depths, whilst in places it appears bare as a reef. All along the shore, therefore, good solid foundations will be found for either masonry or pile-work. 6. I attach a tracing of a section prepared by H M.S. “ Lapwing ” on a line passing through a spot 159 yards north by 4S east from the Sheikh s coal- shed. which gives a very good idea of the fall for some 1,000 yards of the shore line.' Commander MacLean of H. M. S. “ Lapwing” and l went thoroughly over and discussed all the ground, and both agreed in the conclusion that the best site for any proposed coal-sheds was undoubtedly as close as possible to the Sheikh’s shed on the eastward and the spot through which the section attach ed hereto passes was selected so as to give a clear 150 yards for the Sheikh’s enclave; between this spot and the Sheikh's shed the section improves by becom ing steeper 7 Whilst it deteriorates further eastward by becoming less steep. An alternative site presented itself at about the same distance to the west of the Sheikh’s shed, but we found that a large area above the actual high-water mark, as shown on the chart, is liable to flooding at springtides, and this fact would necessitate the construction of a long seawall, some i,8oo yards at least, with high plinths and much filling work' behind it, to allow of buildings remaining sufficiently dry ; moreover the section was hardly as steep from high-water mark to the three-fathom line. 7. I trust that the above paragraph will give ^sufficiently clearly the best site for any buildings or coal depbt now proposed. We can now turn to a consider ation of the rest of the area. From the details given in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above, I am of opinion—and I think 1 have Commander MacLean s support from a seaman’s point of view—that the best site for our rectangular Concession will be with the seaward (north-west) boundary line running about north 64 east and south 64 west through the northernmost corner of the Sheikh’s coal-shed with some 1,600 yards to the eastward and 2,150 yards to the westward of that shed. My reasons for this suggestion are the followihg:— (a) Commencing from the easternmost point, we shall have our frontage (including the Sheikh’s enclave) for nearly 1,600 yards practically on the high-water mark ; buildings, piers, etc., can be conveniently erected along the whole of this frontage economically as necessity arises, without any ex.ra expenditure for seawalls, etc. V) The next 1,800 yards is made up of three portions, along the whole front of which a heavy seawall or wharf will be required if the perfectly straight line is to be preserved and the overflow at high spring tides is to be kept out of the Concession. The first portion, 600 yards, varies from high-water mark down o the two fathom line : the second 550 yards, from the two-fathom line down to three fathoms and up again to two ; the third 650 yards from the two-fathom line up to high-water mark again. (c) The last 350 yards is all above high-water mark on comparatively high ground with a small area of dry ground to the front (north west side). Portion (a) will meet all our possible requirements unless a vast change takes place in the importance of Koweit as a port, such as would result from itsbecomingthe terminus of the Baghdad Railway. In the event of this change taking place general, financial and political considerations would at once make it worth while proceeding with harbour works along portions (b) and (c). In the meantime, if my suggested location of the Concession meets with approval, we hold practically all the available moorings for any ship drawing 20 feet or more with no single mooring further distant than 500 yards and several within 500, whilst, with comparatively short piers, many berths could be arranged for such ships to load and discharge cargo alongside railway jetties at all tides. 8. The above conclusions have been arrived at after much anxious consider ation on the spot and with the advantage of thorough discussion with a Naval Officer in whose hands lay the special survey with the sole object of furnishing the necessary data. The subject being of supreme importance and in view of our position in Koweit and what the future may hold for us in regard to the Baghdad Railway, I have ventured to express my views in some detail in the hope that the final decision as to location may be facilitated. My endeavour has been to suggest the best site for omselves, to leave no opportunity for a horeigii Power and at the same time to keep in view economy of present and future possible construction.[Confidential.'] P-2.

Sir, I have the honour to forward tracing carried out by officers of “ Lapwing for the information of Political officers during recent visits to Koweit. In accordance with your directions the position of the Sheikh’s coal store was fixed by triangulation and is shown on tracing. 2. A site was selected for proposed government coal store and is shown on tracing about 159 yards north-east of Sheikh’s coal-shed. The actual position has been marked by two broad arrows cut in two rocks on the foreshore of the position selected. A section of foreshore through Y opposite this spot is shown on tracing. With reference to my instructions to determine the nature of the bottom to a depth of 20 feet at L.W.S. off the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh I found that Captain Shakespear only desired an 18 foot contour line and such infor mation as could be obtained by a cursory examination. The general nature of the foreshore and bottom have been inserted on tracing. A rough survey was supplied to Captain Shakespear who expressed him self satisfied with the information contained in it. The foreshore of Bunder Shweikh is generally sandy with no sign of coral outcropping except where it is shown on tracing. I should say that coral would be found at varying depths all over the sandy plain and foreshore in the vicinity of the Sheikh’s coal store.The reef shown on the tracing opposite the Sheikh’s coal store is not really a reef but simply coral laid bare by the action of the tide and slopes down to the water just the same as the sandy beach. I have, etc., (Sd.) C. K. MACLEAN, The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division. Lieutenant and Commander. [Demi-Official.] Dated 14th August 1907. From—The Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant in charge current duties, Bushire. Turn that Bunder Shweikh negotiations are taking is better than I expect ed. Sheikh Mubarak has taken the pearl out of the oyster for himself by reserving the coal house recently erected with surrounding compound I5a~yards square coal house occupying the centre of the north-west nr .se aside Apart from that reservation he grants us rectangular plot of ground 3,7^0 yards by 300 yards at a perpetual rent of Rs. 60,000 per annum paid in advance. The north-west boundary 3,750 yards long in a direct line and roughly parallel to foreshore but must conta in coal house or compound. Subiect to these two conditions,^sltion is at our optiom Kent gives right wdtho.it further demand Toall foreshore to depth of 3 fathoms at lowest springtide between north-east and south-west boundaries produced to north-west except immediately in front of Mubarak s reservation and full liberty to erect buildings of any kind, to sublet to British, British Indian and Koweit subjects, to put down buoys and carry out all works necessary to ease passage of steamers from open sea to harbour Shweikh. As area of land now granted is more than 12 times that originally asked for, rent is proportionally one-third of Cox limit, and I strongly recommend I should be empowered to accept at once without further questiom Koweit subjects right of pre-emption or prior lease is stronger than ours to the land surrounding present concession to distance of i.ooo yards from any point of our boundary but otherwise Government has precedence over all comers with regard to such land. f CM Gov fy nme ' t . ba f s absolute right of pre-emption or prior lease to entire island of Shweikh and its foreshore (also called on chart, Karaim). Government had absolute right of pre emption or prior lease to Ras Kathama and foreshore to limit of two nautical miles in any direction but Sheikh reserves to himself la id for house within boundaries of total linear length of 600 (six hundred) yards somewhere at his option near Ras Kathama but will grant a right of way to sea to Government 15 feet broad, if such is found necessary. Kathama land can only be leased. J Concession also contains clause dictated by Sheikh asserting spirited dec- laration of independence and Sheikh Mubarak's determination not to part with his rights in land to any Foreign Government including Turkey or to their subjects without consent of British Government asked for' and granted. Agreement is terminable at option of^ British Government only. Sheikh Mubarak also binds his heirs but his signature only holds good for two months. If within that period, Government consents, Agreement is binding. If not, new terms can be arrranged. /’..S'.—Plan may shift to right enclosed gives rough idea of concession but north-west line or left and it will perhaps be better to bring it to the left a bit. S. G. KNOX.[Demi-Official]. Dated Koweit, the 14th August 1907. From—The Political Agent, Koweit, To—The First Assistant Resident. Latest reports just before closing the mail. Moola Abdulla took the amended agreement up to the Sheikh by request and read over and over to him with a map of the same kind as I send you now which I prepared tor him. He made a few verbal alterations. The land in Kathama could only be hired at a rent that would satisfy the Sheikh, the Sheikh’s house compound at Kathama would be enclosed by 600 yards instead of 500 yards and a curious interpola tion, the 150 yards north-west boundary of Sheikh Mubarak’s reservation is to be exclusive of the coal house dimensions. I boggled at this a bit as it upsets the symmetry of the plan but I don’t see that it really affects the concession. *•*•*** Suggested Revised Version of Translation of the Second Clause of the First Con dition of the Bunder Shweihh Agreement.

Sir With reference to Marine Department letter No. 1360-M. of the 21st October 1909, on the subject of the establishment of before His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor General of India in Council;- 2. It is considered that the location of the concession should be such that the SheiiLh's coal shed would be exactly in the middle of the frontage. The site proposed is indicated by the rectangle ruled in pencil on the largest of the enclosed tracings. 3. This position, opposite Bunder Shweikh anchorage, is, however, 4£ miles from the anchorage for large ships in Koweit Harbour. Bunder Shweikh anchorage is narrow and confined, and capable of accommodating at one time only three ships of the ’’Proseppine” class and three gun-boats. 4. Springs rise 10 to 11 feet, neaps 7 to 9 feet, so that a ship of the ’’Proserpine” class should be able to enter at high water on any day, but it would be advisable to erect a tide pole, so that the depth of the channel could be signalled to incoming vessels, and to lay down moorings for three vessels of the Proserpine class. 5. Midway between the outer anchorage (Aoweit Harbour) and the inner anchorage (Bunder Shweikh), the channel carrying not less than 12 feet at L.W.O.S., narrows to one cable for a distance of 400 yards, and then opens out again. It would be necessary to buoy the mouth of this funnel and to erect leading marks. 6. The tracings enclosed in the letter under reply are returned herewith as requested. I have etc. • v (sd) E.J.W.

A reference to the printed copy of the “Plan of Bandar Shwei&amp;h' (made by uhe officers of Eks Majestfb -^y*s Snip M Lapwing**in 1909) virill show that tne point marked as .d.B* Comer of Sheikh* s Coal Shed lies JO y ards S*.30.E*within the sea boundarj r of the chain- -dotted rectangle which has been ieoidei upon as tne location of uhe British Government's ooncesuion; ai.d, that the seaward face of this concession is a line rtu -ning N.60.E* and S.dO.W which lies for the greater part of it-a length below High-tfater mark. 3. His Majesty's Government have decided that the Sheikh's coal aged shall be located in the centra of our concession on its seaward boundary. Such being the case the chaan-dotted rectangle should, 1 submit , be shown with its seaward boundary running through the Sheikh's shed , aid thereby securing to us a further stri^ of dry ground along the whole length of its soitis cp, il.h- e -vst. (I 'in 1../ard) a i ie • The xo c ex -Uic 3 u L' otii id view as cori , ec*t is wholly advaiiu^geous oO us, for* uhe follotrthg reasons: — (b,) the *berms of the lease-a^raeiaent, we are boxml only to .an aprraximabe High-Water uarh f on . 3 &gt;iraight line between two points 7500 cubits (5750 yards) apart, all gromd to the seaward of this line being ipso facto inducted in our ooncea -sion uv bo the limit of the 3-fathoms line below low water* line re fore it is to ovr adv ntage , vmile fulfilling trie above oonlition , to loo &lt;;be the seaward boundary as miiOh on Iry land as f be nossible, so securing the macdmura amount of ground for future buildings, etc* (b), A reference to the revised translation of the agreement will also show that the Shexkh /^// reserves to himself a square of 500 cubits (150 yards) side within our concession on the saarard f ace but '•exclusive of the measurement of the house”. This shad is an iregular hexagon, whose perimeter amounts to 206 ft, 9 inches, (or 166 cubits), -Mid whose depth from fronjs to rear is 59 feet (or 46 cubits). It must be remembered that all Arab measurement is linear and not square, ad therefore to give the Sheikh the full 1200 cubit3 of his square enclave and it the same time exclude his coal-shed , it will be necessary to run ‘uio seaward boundary' through the rearmost of his hex- - agonal shed’s angles* If this is done we shall gain some 73 yarls of depth for our concession fa along its mole length and this vill besides brin bring the sea war'd boundary' more evenly along iig - -siater marK* 4.

Tills seons quite definite and I do not think we could suggest any diacontinu^o© of exemption unloss the Shaikh broke into revolt against us or joined our enemies or oonmitted sono equally heinous offence, 3, It remains therefore to consider tho question of a now subsidy./'! v| If we cancel the Shwciisk lease under clause III the present payment of As *60,000 /- per ai^rrum will lapse # B»it wo have built tho wiroless buildings and a pier on portions of the ground, vnd we rmst oorthinly negotiate with the ghaildi for the lease of the ground on which the former are built, if not tiie latter# 4# I wae at first of opinion that it would be beet to lease both the sitcj^ occupied by the buildings and a pieco of foreshore at the base of tie pier, but the Political Agent info?T*.8 no that the and of the pier is beginning to bo washed away, and that there are two cracks right across it, nd that ha porsonally does not consider it worth while to spend any more nonoy on it, in the circumstances.

I have nade as extensive enquiries as I could, without arousing suspicion, regarding the current rate of ground rent for land in the vicinity, but regret that X have heen unable to obtain any useful figures, as the renting of land, as such, is practically unknown here, the almost universal custom being to buy it. The sale price of land in Kuwait varies very considerably according to its positions that situated on the sea front in a central part of the town being, of course^the moat valuable. The aost expensive I have heard of is a small plot on the sea front near the west end of the town, estimated to be about 100 cubits long by 40 broad, which is valued at Rs. 3,700/-, or rough!

Dr. Hjrlrea ahowed me a plot just at the back of the maaion property ahioh they would like to buy. The plot is 65yds by 44 (by ay pacing), and he tells me that he has been advised by Arab friends on no account to give more than Rs. 500/- for it, and told that he ought to get it for Rs. 250 /- which works out at from roughly lOas. to R. 1/4 per cubit.

The only thing against the absolute termination of the lease is the point raised in the second paragraph of your telegram No.97-S of 19 th December. It is a matter for consideration whether it would not be a mistake to abrogate the agreement which might be useful some day if the Shaikh is to be an independent potentate, and in view of the uncertainty of the future of Mesopotamia. . 1 It was, of course, Salim 1 s obstructiveness which first raised the question of the termination of the lease, not that it would be much satisfaction to Ahmad to know that it was to his uncle that he owed the loss of money. /ft7A- -..
