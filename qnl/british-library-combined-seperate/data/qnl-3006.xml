A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence between the Political Agent at Bahrain, the British Embassy at Tehran and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, concerning allegations of illegal trade between Bahrain and Iran by a merchant from Bushire, who was responsible for smuggling sugar, tea and opium into Bahrain, and who is believed to be employed by the Agency as an 'informer'.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iran, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Tea</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Opium trade</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sugar</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001c6#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001c6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
