Talking of fans, did you hy any chance mention the question of 'House^and 'fans'* when you were in Simla ? I nearly sent you a wire ahout it, hut thought you would he sure to remember the matter. How does the position stand now ? and is there any chance of things happening this summer? O'Connor came somewhere ahout the 15th May and left on the 5th June. I found him a very nice person and we got on famously. He unfortunately has left me a whole heap of trihal lists to complete and send after him, including short notes on the trihes them selves, their methods of fighting the present state of Wahahism^ etc.,etc. I hope to have them finished hy the mail after next, it was a great piece of work getting a K.C.I.E. for the Shaikh, and I have to thank you very mu ch indeed for having put the matter through so success fully. The Shaikh is immensely pleased with himself and with everyone else in consequence. I also receive a sort of reflecteji glory, as he thinks I had a hand in the matter. As a matter of fact the honour came Just at the right time, for the old man was getiting more and more downhearted morose. I am m hopes that he will 'buck y^p and take a keener and aclor view of life now. rUrvCtS Our-2- Our King's TDirtMay party came off well. We arranged a drawing room, frraJo fashion, on the roof of the Agency which seated 'bet?/een 70 and 80 guests. Dinner was served on our front verandah and was quite the 'best cooked food I have tasted for some time, even though I say so! Kuwait is talking a great deal ahout India these days, and the opinion is prevalent that things are much worse than offical reports make out. There is little douht that the Arahs here firmly 'believe the country to he in the throes of full r e bellion. It is difficult to try tO: correct this view without at once laying onself open to the charge f trying to hide matters and propaganding in favour of Government. Of course the anti-British elements. have not 'been slow to take the fullest advantage of happenings in India and with a weak Euler in power they are having a good innings. Shaikh Ahmad himself 4n other ways also is not 'being all that he should he I fear. If my information is correct he is going in more and more for all-night parties in the walled in date and fruit gardens, on the outskirts of the Town. At these I fear drinking and dancing girls are a feature. He himself does not drink of course, 'but he's inclining towards a wilder life with lots of women in the picture, looks as if he were falling more and more into thejhands of his cunning Secretary who leads the parties. I hope of course the stories that reach me are exaggerated, or that it is only a summer madness with him. The trouble of course is that all the members of the Kuwait Ruling family^ have so little to do and tesc^x ahove all they do not know what a game is.' ® -3- I have had my eyes opened lately to another rather unpleasant trait in Shaikh Ahmad*s character. So long as the close proximity of the Ate'bei n an and Bin Saud kept him anxious^ and afraid of the future he was charm itself and hutter would not melt in his mouth. Now that the Bofeey has receded into the distance, and Bin Saud has retired for the summer to Tai^-, Shaikh Ahmad*s mentality has undergone a change. He rarely visits the Agency now and seems to 'be satisfied with a lazy and indolent life. It is even whispered that he has 'been trying to win Bin Saud's favour lately 'by writing to him fullsome letters to the effect that he would never have raised any difficulties about handing hack Nejd camels^ etc,, and allowing Bin Saud # s officials to search Kuwait as much as they liked hut it was the British Government and its r olitical Officers who prevented this, in spite of all he could say or do, with the foxy Mullah Salth his Secretary as his adviser,certainly is capable of such action. The news from India as welJ as anti-British propa ganda may on the other hand he having its effect on him, or it may he due to the summer or loo many late nights. The fact remains however that a carelessness and slackness appears to have settled down upon him and he ncjlonger shows keenness in public affairs or in visiting the Agency, $e are of course on the best of terms private^ and let us hope the phraso is only a passing one. The moral behind it all would seem that we ought to have something to rf^fghten him with, whenever he gets slack or Please-4- \ Please do not 'be alarmed at what I say.

I have the honour to report that on receipt of the first of the above letters referred to, and anti cipating that you wou^d wish me to take action, I referred the matter to H.S. the Shaikh of Kuwait. I received the Shaikh's final written reply today, 25th June 1930, (see enclosure), as well as a visit from His Exeellency ; at which he was able to enlarge on the rather cursory report submitted by him. The Shaikh assured me that he had gone to considerable trouble to try and trace some of the revol vers whose numbers were given, even going to the extent ^of spending a considerable sum of money out of his privy purse in the employment of secret enquiry agents. In spite of everything he has failed to find a single 'Iraq Army revolver in the town, or among his tribal population. ^ The Shaikh added that it would be interesting to know exactly how the report which originally emanated from the Commandant Southern Desert Police, reached that official. Was it only a rumour? Or had he any definite inioroiation to go on? He suggested also that possibly the story was put about by persons interested in the sale of the revolvers, to cause suspicion to fall on persons residing at a distance - a favourate trick of gun runningrunning gentry. 5* His Excellency has promised to keep a sharp lookout and make further report if anything suspicious should be found.

As it has been reported by the Commandant of Police Southern Desert to Baghdad that certain revolvers bearing the mark mentioned in paragraph 3 above have been seen in the hands of some of Your Excellency's subjects and as these are suspected to have purchased them from certain arms dealers in the town of Kuwait, it is consi dered highly important to try and find out from where 1he latter got the weapons in the first instance. ® 5.

V 1V A few days ago I had an interesting talk witii the Shaikh about the depressed condition of the pearl trade and bad times generally. I also discussed a rather cool suggestion of Jardine of Basrah that perhaps the Shaikh would care to lend Bg lacs of money to the Mutasarrif of Mosul, eldest son to the late Ahmad Pasha 'al-Sana' of Basrah. Shaikh whilst rightly turning the request down ? casually mentioned some interesting and illuminating facts about money he and his predecessors had loaned since Mubarak* s time and which looked as if it would never be seen again. Chief of these was a sum of Rs 3,000,000/- which had been given out on loan by different rulers of Kuwait to assist local merchants in their difficulties. The various amounts comprising this total had been given with out interest, and the borrowers did not show any signs of wanting to repay it so far. ^ sums he. Shaikh Ahmad, himself had lost, or given out on loan were as follows:- (a) Es 200,000/- loaned to Mohamed al-Sudairawi (paragraph 6 of my confidential No.254 of 11th June 1930) who recently failed in V Bombay. The money a total loss. (b) Es 35,000/- loaned to one of the Zaiyani family of Bahrain now bankrupt. Money probably ^ost. (c) Es 50,000/- Loaned to Ahmad Pasha al Sana 1 CI ' V .

No sign of this coming back d-ue to depressed Pearl Trade. The nan is reported to be in 'shaky' state. (e) Es 200,000/— loaned to Seyed Hamid Bey al- Naqib to do business wiMi in Basrah.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that some weeks i ago, I asked His Excellency the Shaikh if I could take over the so called Shaikh of Muhamaerah f s tt Hauta tf , or piece of land where he used to tether his horses in the days of Shaikh Mubarak and which I had already selected as a suitable site for the New Agency provided no one claimed it. The Shaikh who had previously approved my choice, verbally gave ^^ me the necessary permission, but as a precautionary measure requested me to address the Ex-Shaikh of Muhamaerah*s Agent in Basrah, and find out whether any documents existed, under which claim might possibly later be made to the 'Hauta' in question,, 2 # I accordingly wrote privately to Khan Bahadur ^ Mirza Mulxaimm d, G.I.Eo, the Shaikh of MuhaI^nlerah , s Agent in Basrah, and pointed out that although His Excellency had 10 granted me the necessary permission to build on the piece of land mentioned, both he and I desired to know, if the Shaikh of Muhammerah either laid any claim to it, or possessed any doouments proving his claim, as there was nothing on record in Kuwait, 3, A reply No.1917/19/241 dated the 3rd October 1930 has now come from Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad, duplicate copies of which I am forwarding to you with this a The Agent's letter speaks for itself and is satisfactory as far -2--3- far as the n Hauta tt is concerned, and I propose taking it over, pending work 'being started on the New Agency* M' Vr- 4o You will notice that in the latter part of Shaikh Sjjb Khazaal Khan's message to me, he jL says he is prepared to sell his 'big palace, and G-uest house situate near DASMAII, and i enquires whether, I would agree to a'secret' deal# ij'. As regards these palaces His Sxcellency the Shaikh of Kuwait some time^ back told me that it was practically certain that the Shaikh of Muhammerah possessed no title deeds at all for the buildings nor for the land on which they stand and that Shaikh Mubarak merely allowed the Shaikh of Muhammerah to run up the buildings as a favour and because of their great friendship# Apparently the two rulers were on tems of such close intimacy, that Mie saying n What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine' was a regular expression used between them# , On the otherj^Mubarak did build a large Residence in the town and gave,it to the Shaikh of Muhammerah as a gift, together with all documents for same, while the Shaikh of Muhammerah repaid the compliment at Failiyeh near Muhammerah# 60 To return to the palaces now offered for sale - His Excellency the Shaikh has told me { also some time back) that for the old Shaikh of Muhammerah T s sake, and out of personal regard for him, he never raised the question of ownership of the buildings lest he embarass the old man, but after his death he intended looking into the question and enquiring whether proof of this ownership did exist or not, and that failing the production of title deeds he would probably claim them as Crown lands# 7# I rather suspect Khan Bahadur Mirza Muhammad his principal possesses no papers so has advised a secret / sale to us if possible, which if put through would neatly short-circuit the Shaikh of Kuwaiti plans#-3- &gt; 8 0 The Main Palace I believe was built for 3 lacs of rupees and the smaller for something under a laco I should think a fair offer to make today would be one lac for the big palace and 30^000/- for the small / were Govern ment desire^sof acquiring them. 9.

Please refer to your confidential despatch Mo. 314 f \ dated 13th October 1930# I do not think Uiat the Idea of buying the Shaikh of i/iohaamerah 1 s house and converting it into a new agency is a good one# My experience of converted oriental houses is that they are very seldom satisfactory. The whole style of 'building is so totally different to ours that even if one spends a very considerable sum in alterations it is seldom possible to make them as convenient as a house specially designed for occupation by Europeans. Further, now that the question of the new Agency is under consideration I think it would be most undesirable to confuse the issue by suggesting any alternatives. 1 therefore suggest that you should inform the Shaikh of Mohammerah's Agent that Govern ment have no desire to acquire the palace. t.Colonel H.R.P.Dickson,ca.E ## Political Agent, Kuwait .Political Agency, Kuwait, Dated the 5tli January 1931.

The move has given satisfaction to all and it is hoped will bring in a considerably higher revenue than the old direct house tax.53/32. Extract from Bahrain d.o. letter No. C/59, aated 27th May 1931.

HnSK9U^&gt; I ♦ w, y/' It / Will you please refer to your D.O .N0 .IOO6 b dated l^th May 1931 regarding the tax on imports recently imposed by His Excellency the Shaikh. 2. As a result of a talk, I had with His Excellency this morning (25th May 1931) on the subject, I do not think the new import tax infringes the 1907 agree ment for reasons given below^ and I feel certain the Shaikh would never have moved in the matter had he thought that it did. The Shaikh was of course quite aware of the wording of the treaty and paragraph 10, even though to refresh his memory I showed him the English and Arabic version. In the first place, the Shaikh pointed out that the wording of the treaty, as far as he understood it imported forbade him to raise the duty on goods exported from or into Kuwait by British subjects including British Indians. But that he was free to make ^pn increase in the case of his j own subjects should the state finances render this necessary With this view I concur. 5* Secondly the Shaikh assured me that al- | though there were about a dozen Indians all told making a ^ | - . _ /W--VV - . j'-c-!*..- « -Living in Kuwait, only one soda-water manufacturer, extorted anything into Kuwait, and very occasionally an Indian who runs a flour mill here. The others were all people of the barber, oculist and durzi type who imported or exported nothing. In spite of this however he the Shaikh had passed' orders to the Director of Customs, that the extra ^ tax Captain J, R. L. Bradshaw, Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.tax was in no case to be levied from British subjects. He had done this the day the new tax was inaugurated, though he had not thought it worth moitioning to me. quite clear that the levying, ot the new tax ot originated from the Kuwait merchants themselves, and was a sort of subscription to be taken from the rich of the town, to ease the lot of the many poor who today were finding it very hard to keep themselves alive, much less pay house tax. In other Y/ords the 'well to do w had come forward and offered to bear the burden of the city House Tax, provided such house tax was abolished, and they considered that the easiest way of bringing this about was to ask the Shaikh to impose on themselves the merchantile community the small additional burden of over and above the reasonable import duty they already paid. raised in your last paragraph. The Shaikh said that ever since he came to the throne the import duty levied on his subjects, and everyone else has been 4$. It used to be 10% in Mubarak's and Jabir's time,(except on B-titish subjects) , but that Salim hoping to win the Kuwait 'ulema' favour (who all along had said that the ruler had no right to take more than by Sheria Law) reduced the import tax to 4%. This figure was agreed to by the Tt Ulema' because the leading merchants gave out that they would not accept in the interests of their State a lesser reduction. the Ulema up all along to work a reduction from the hated 10%. 8# 1 hope what I have said above will show that no infringment of the 1907 Treaty has taken place, nor was in any way intended. 5.

Political Agency, Bahrain,the 2nd August 1931 The recent visit of Shaikh Ahmad al Jabir has been a great surprise to everyone,-hot least Shaikh Hamad,hut I have been unable to discover any single reason which would account for it. 0ii-» from a remark which Shaikh Sir Ahmad let drop I understand that he intended to go to Basra but not receiving a suitable response from the Iraq_ Government he changed his mind and at the last moment decided to visit Bahrain. The second reason is,I think,that having bought a new launch he must needs prove it and this was the only direction he could conveniently come in. Unfortunately he has shown a somewhat critical attitude towards his Bahrain hosts and seldom lets an opportunity pass of pointing out how much more civilized he and his household are. He gave the other officials,myself and Shaikh Hamad a dinner on his yacflt last night,an entertainment which I hope he will not repeat. It was extremely hot. There was a decided swell and his electric light machinery made a most unpleasent noise^ and not a single dish was in any way palatable to Shaikh Hamad; ^and his host insisted on his drinking limejuice which everyone one knows does not suit him)but such is Shaikh Hamad's natural kindliness and dignity that he never let it be guessed how little the entertainment was to his taste. shaikh Ahmad tells me that he contemplates purchasing soke pied a terre in Bahrain. I do not know what your views are in the matter but I think it would prove rather expensive to Shaikh Hamad as he always feels under an obligation to spend on people who come here whether it is necessary or not. ^ble Major T.G.W.Powle.O.B.E., tical Resident in the Persian Gulf Bu^hire. :gofl^dential.

DICKSON, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Agent, Koweit. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Notes on his Excellency Sheikh A hmad's Trip to Riath. HIS Excellency the Sheikh returned to Koweit on the 3rd April, 1932, having ien delayed a day at A1 KLhafs by King Ibn Saud, who insisted on keeping him ick an extra twenty-four hours there. 2. Ignorant of this change of plan the Political Agent and leading citizens Koweit proceeded on the 2nd April to Khabrat-al-Duwish, 57 miles out, to eet the Sheikh and party. As he failed to arrive the Political Agent and the hers again went out to a point 22 miles from Koweit on the 3rd April, 1932 /hawaibidah). This meeting of their Ruler is an old custom and highly valued r both Ruler and people of Koweit. 3. The following are the main points of interest connected with the Sheikh's itry into the city {a) The Sheikh and party arrived there at 3-30 p.m . in fifteen cars. Ten being those his party took to Riath and the remaining five being new ones presented by Ibn Saud. (&amp;) The Sheikh halted half an hour for coffee and to get tidied up preparatory to making his official entry into the city. {c) This entry was made at 5 p.m ., a total of some forty cars taking part in the procession. [462 t-1]i id) The Sheikh led the procession in a large ' Cadillac ' 8-cylinder saloon car, presented to Ibn Saud by Mr. Crane, the American, and which formed the principal present of the King to the Sheikh. (e) The Sheikh insisted on the Political Agent sitting on his right hand during the entry. Wonderful scenes of rejoicing were met with, and route from Jahara Gate to the town palace was lined with thousands of cheering crowds. In particular, large numbers of women were in evidence, both in tlie streets and lining house-tops, and their ululations and singing were a feature. At intervals swordsmen danced before the cars to the accompaniment of drum-beating, &amp;c. {g) The Ruler made his way to his Great Mij lis hall on the sea front, and there halted and held a reception at which the whole city seemed to be present. This lasted till nightfall, when the Sheikh was able to get away and see his own family at ' Dasman ' Palace. {h) Koweit has apparently rarely seen such wonderful scenes of rejoicing, and the welcome the people gave their Ruler was significant as well as touching. 4. On the 4th April, 1932, the Sheikh came and saw the Political Agent and recounted his experiences, which were as follows :— {a) The outward journey, of exactly 462 miles by mileometer, and made in twenty-three hours of actual driving, was via Manaqish, Khabrat-al- Duwish, Khabari Waatha, Jarriya Ilya, Thalaat Turaibi to Kanhara (immediately east of the Dhana on Sadlier 's 1819 route). From there cars turned sharp west and proceeded to Ruma and Rumhiyeh. From there again cars followed the route Shaib Hamayim, to Hamama, Thamama, through Bawabiyat, direct to Riath, leaving Banban about 7 miles to west. (Return journey was the same except that the party were taken to A1 Khafs by the King, who spent two days in camp there witli them. From A1 Khafs the cars went up Shaib-al-Tauki till thej reached Rumhiyeh.) The whole road was hard and gravelly-going, except when Dhana was crossed. This strip was sandy and very trying on cars. Tyres had not to be deflated, however, but the Sheikh remarked that any cars travelling by this route in future should have five passengers, | excluding driver, as frequently cars stuck and only five persons could get cars out of sand. From Rumahiyeh to Riath road was terribly stony, with many boulders everywhere. At Bawabiyat was, perhaps, the worst portion of the whole road,! as here the track wound down a steep spur with precipices on one side, and a single mistake would have meant that a car would go over the edge and be dashed to bits in the gorge below. The return detour via Khafs though a trifle longer, was easier (ft) The Sheikh said that he surprised the King at Riath as he was going out to pitch camp for him. The meeting was most cordial anc affectionate, and was followed by eight days of Royal entertainment in the capital with two days in the camp at A1 Khafs. (c) The Sheikh saw all members of the A1 Saud family, including Amir Sand (son), Mahomed (brother), Abdullah (brother), Ibn Musaad, Governoi of Hail (cousin), and the leading members of the Ibn Rashid familj of Hail, including Mahomed-bin-Tallal, the ex-Amir of JeW Shammar. (d) Apparently the Sheikh's speech on arrival was to effect that he was Bot like other Arabs, who usually come to beg for money or a gift. ® sole object was to see his old friend and brother, and to remove wrong impressions that the newspapers and other interested parties were trying to convey, namely, that he. Sheikh Ahmad, was trying to for® a confederacy of Arab Rulers of the Gulf, more or less in opposite to him the King. He added that Ibn Saud was his elder brother, and pi P PI I, We ll&amp; 3 as such it was his (Ahmad's) duty to come and see him from time to er | ca ii,i | time. He wished Ibn Saud clearly to understand from the beginning ei ^ \ that he desired no form of favour or present from him nor would he )n hi8t| - accept any, but that if he would like to give his servants the customary largesse, that, of course, was not his concern. ^ % (e) According to the Sheikh, Ibn Saud, who literally wept copious tears on their arrival, in reply to this preliminary speech, swore that Koweit deuce, If was the loveliest spot in the whole universe, its Ruler his dearest andsiji friend, and its women the most fair. That his love for the house of re the (j Subah was eternal, and that just as the A1 Saud and A1 Subah Standards had flown side by side in every victory or defeat, during theseai the last 300 years, so he prayed and believed it would continue to so de citjj fly in future. This and very much more in the same strain was said heikliij according to the Sheikh, and Ibn Saud surpassed all expectations in ilace the way he went out of his way to make his guests feel comfortable and happy. 'uraiW oute), I IRiunfe ifm, toi vingBii SI gnii® 5. The following were the principal subjects of conversation that took place between himself and Ibn Saud (according to the Sheikh) ;— ie Mia / («) Ibn Saud, in general talk on world politics, expressed great fear of the Turks and Persians. He said he could manage Europeans easily, but ieten| he believed a European war was 'again coming, in which case the Turks would find a way of returning to Iraq, and Persia would endeavour to seize Bahrein and Hasa. The Turks and Persians were far away the worst Moslems in the world, and also far more cunning in their methods than any European Power. Hence he feared them. I, (h) He thought a great deal of King Feisal, whom he liked for his honourable and straight dealings. Abdullah of Transjordan, on the other hand, he thought was a poisonous intriguer who was responsible for all the propaganda that was going .on against him in Hejaz, Nejd, Iraq and ! P ar r : the Persian Gulf. It was a pity he could not rest and let the past be. lc fr He feared Abdullah would not be happy till he raised another rebellion against him (by this he meant, said the Sheikh, that Abdullah was responsible for the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30). ixcepti ( c ) ib n s auc [ told him that he intended shortly sending Emir Feisal, his ig 011 ® second son, on a tour of the European capitals in the same way as the Emperor of Abyssinia had done. Euad Hamza would go with him, ve kf and his secretary, Yusuf Yasin, would in their absence be in charge of ^fivep® his Foreign Office. (d) Mr. Philby would return to Mecca on or about the 5th April from his stony,« Ruba-al-Khali tour. He had already sent back certain stones and objects of interest to Riath to be forwarded to him in Mecca, of tie® (e) The King did not press the Sheikh to go to the Haj this year, but precip® promised that next spring (1933) he would come up to Koweit for a car# few weeks and then would take Sheikh Ahmad to the Haj, making first a tour of Riath, Qasim and Hail. From the latter place he would go to Medina and then lastly to Mecca. This plan he had worked out u Ai and would follow to the letter. most® (/) The Sheikh asked if he, Ibn Saud, had really borrowed £500,000 from the English. But his host did not give him a 'yea ' or 'nay,' but contented himself by saying that he was trying to get a loan, and that I Egyptian and Iraqi newspapers would stupidly attach ridiculous conditions and terms to any efforts of his to raise such loan. (g) The Sheikh warned him again and again to go slow in the matter of expenditure, and said that in the way he was going he would most !X assuredly 'crash.' The Sheikh said that he particularly talked , ll| r 'straight ' in the matter of the obvious waste that he saw all round ictt him where motor cars were concerned. He urged Ibn Saud reduce iey or ' his number of cars by three-quarters and standardise by concentrating ^ re . on Fords and Chevrolets. For himself as King a few good luxury est^ i cars were perhaps necessary, but he must stop the ridiculous ^ expenditure on every form and variety of expensive cars which he saw [462 t—1] b 2 • less i'round him. In this connexion the Sheikh said that it made his '' stomach pain and his heart sore ' to see the number of cars obviously new and expensive that, after doing only 5,000 kilom., were discarded as scrap-iron. Ignorant Bedouin drivers were, of course, responsible and lack of proper supervision. The Amir Saud, for instance, had eighty cars to himself, and God knew how many Ibn Masaad and the Amir Feisal possessed. According to the Sheikh, he strongly advised the King to appoint a good Englishman in place of the rascally Indian 'Sadiq ' to be in the sole charge of all his mechanical transport, together with half a dozen honest British mechanics (ex-soldiers) who would be under him. The Englishman, of course, to have extensive powers for fines, dismissals, &amp;c. The King did not seem to relish the suggestions. (h) The Sheikh asked if he had had the country round Riath and A1 Khafs examined by geologists as they looked very likely places for oil. The King said 'yes,' but that he was not anxious in the least to grant concessions to foreigners. (i) Whilst in Riath, a convoy arrived bearing machinery and gear for a 4,000-mile radius new wireless set. This was to be set up in Riath. (j) The' Sheikh said he asked Ibn Saud what would be his policy when the English withdrew from Iraq altogether. Ibn Saud replied, obviously in joke, said the Sheikh, that he would not be slow to take advantage of such situation, as Iraq was a good country. (k) On the subject of the Koweit blockade, Ibn Saud kept complete silence, and Sheikh Ahmad said it would have been undignified for him to open the question or make any mention of a matter which might convey the impression that he came as a suppliant. Ibn Saud did, however, mention that he knew his frontier officers were mostly bad and were nearly always responsible for misunderstandings that took place. His frontier patrols also looted and stole helpless people's goods, not for himself, Ibn Saud, but for themselves. He lamented the fact that he was surrounded by many of the biggest rascals on earth, but what could he do running the '' show '' alone as he was doing ? As regards his official, Ibn Khraimis, on the Koweit frontier, he urged Sheikh to treat him as his own official and order his every going and coming (a typical Saudian move). (Z) The King asked after the Honourable the Political Resident in Bushire, and Colonel Dickson and family, and expressed great pleasure at having met them in Hasa recently. 6. The following are some of the impressions left on the Sheikh's mind as result of his visit:— \{a) Ibn Saud's position was unassailable so long as he remained alive. The whole laboriously built system would, however, most assuredly topple and collapse as soon as the King died. Ibn Saud still inspired wholesome fear wherever he went, and this was especially evident at Riath, the heart of his Government. He was still a very great man and leader, but, in his opinion (the Sheikh's), the whole of the King s system was more than ever a one man show. (6) Ibn Saud was, on the other hand, a definitely sick and unfit man. Gone were the days when he was the hardest man in his kingdom and led every raid and foray. Sheikh Ahmad opined that this was because he never took any exercise these days at all and ate far too much. On one occasion ne, Ibn Saud, took the Sheikh to his old capital of Dharaiyeh and both got out to walk. After 100 yards or so the King began to pant and blow and said he could not go on. This gave the Sheikh tlie opportunity of giving him a lecture, and he urged on him the vital necessity of taking at least half an hour's walk each day, and begged him to stop taking drugs, which apparently the King now cannot do without. I (c) The King, said the Sheikh, ate far too much to be good for him, and a one sitting could put away a whole lamb himself.&lt;rf sti (d) The Amir Saud was a fine upstanding young men, as tall as his father and with lots of character, but at the 'break up' which would assuredly follow the King's death, the Sheikh much doubted if Saud would be able to 'make good.' There were the ambitious Mahomed and Abdullah an^aliost of others, who all even now hated and were jealous of one another, to be reckoned with. All would be at each other's throats when the strong hand left them. The Sheikh was particularly taken with the Amir Saud's charms of manner, and was overwhelmed altogether when the latter called and, after paying his respects, said : 'I want you to treat me firstly as your best friend, and secondly as your son, and thirdly as your servant, not only during your visit here, but throughout the rest of our respective lives.' Perhaps the Amir Saud saw the da^ not far distant when he would want an ally on the coast. {e) The Amir Ibn Musaad had aged very greatly. He was only 40 years old, but the Sheikh, who knew him in less peaceful times when they both used to go on raids together, said he was shocked to see what a great change had come over him. He was obviously being killed by worry and the cares of his high office. {/) The town of Riath was indescribably filthy, and, except for the group of rather tine Tiouses mhaBiraTBy*tHe King and his family, which all communicated by means of upstair passages, was like a rabbit warren. Flies were dreadful, and smells and refuse in painful evidence.

Excellency^ excursions into personal diplomacy have not in the past been altogether fortunate. However, I cannot refuse his request as he would not unnaturally hoM that as a grievance. It will doubtless be a good thing for him to meet His Majesty personally, and if he can get anything out of the latter as to his gardens so much the better# thing for you to go with him, as this - even though his visit is a purely private one - might in the eyes of the 'Iraqis give it an official, or semi-official flavour, while personally I think he is probably more likely to be welcomed in 'Iraqi circles if he goes by himself without any British Officer in attendance. On the other hand if he makes a mess of things I should like it to be self-evident that the responsibility is entirely his, which it will have to be if he went alone.

There is a possibility of course that he may now| decide to postpone his visit, seeing that the Anglo Persain Oil Company have now come forward with a serious proposal for I an agreement, and Chisholm has moved his quarters to Kuwait. Thank you very much for suggesting that I run 4. over to Bushire and stay a few days. If you do not mind, I think I will remain at my Headquarters for the present for the following reasons, firstly I have a vast amount of local work to get through which accumulated when I went to Shargah. Secondly Holmes is due back on 31st August, and with both him here as well as the A.P.C.C. representative, I feel I ought to be on the spot, lest the Shaikh make a fool of himself. Thirdly the recent promulgation by the Iraq Minister of Finance, authorizing the Ashur Tax on the 1932 date crop (see your No.569.S. dated the 9th August 1932), and the absence | Ox any specific assurance from the High Commissioner that the tax would not apply to the Shaikh*s gardens, till the matter was finally settled between His Majesty's Government and Iraq resulted in great despondency here and had a bad reaction on the Shaikh.

Sir, In continuation of my telegram No # 581 dated tiie 6th September 1932, I have 1he honour to report that His Ixcellemy 1±Le Shaildi returned by air direct from Baghdad on the morning of the 6th September. Three Iraq'Puss Moth^ aeroplanes brou^it the Shaikh back, and his own particular machine was piloted by Mr»MJUJawad, Commanding the Royal Iraq Air Force. 3. The journey was done in 3 hours and 5 minutes from start to stop, a very good performance^ No stop was made at Shaibah. 4. His Excel^Bnc^r was most charmed with the reception accorded him by His Majesty King Faisal, and with the kindness shown him by the Acting High Comissioner and the various Ministers and officials, whom he came in contact with. 5. He only spent the 4rth and 5th September in Baghdad apart f ran the dey of his arrival, the 3rd September. During this period he lunched wttte dined and had after noon tea with the King and also dined with His Excellency the Acting Higja Comnissioner. i C A&lt;V-2- On his departure His Majesly King Faisal conferred on the Shaikh iiie ^Order of 1iie Rafidain '!civil) ^ which greatly pleased him® I believe the order is of the 1st Class, but I am talcing steps to find out about this exactly^ *?• In the course of Ihe various conversations which the King Had with the Shaikh, the former discussed three topics at considerable length (accofting to the Shaikh). (a) Ibn Rifada^ Rebellion. (b) The Kuwait Blockade. (c) Relations between Kuwait and Eis Majesty*s Government«, regards (a) Ihe King gave the Shaikh full details of the stupid effort of Ibn Rlfada, which had deservedly ended in his defeat and dealh. He felt no sympathy at all he said for a person who with only 4oo men attempted to conquer a Kingdom. The King then dilated objectionable on 1iie/way in which Bin Saud in public regularly heaped abuse on the sons of Shereef Hussain. This was neither chivalrous nor becoming a monarch of Bin Saud^ calibre and standing* Indeed he had taxed Ihe imir Faisal with the matter when the latter was in Baghdad. The King asked the Shaikh many questions of his relations with Bin Saud and what he thoa^it of him personally, to which the Shaikh says he gave reply to the effect that apart from the Blockade the harm it was doing Kuwait, he had nothing to complain of, indeed he looked on Bin Saud as his good friend, and could never forget his recent charming treat ment of him when in Riadh. ( As regards (b) the King asked vsmj searching questions about the Blockade and whether the Shaikh held a 'document' from His Majesty's Government promising definitely to have^removed, as a reward for his co-operating with His Majesty's GorernnBnt during the Akhwan rebellion of Faisal al Duwisfcu The Shaikh said—3— (VtP said that he replied to the efTeot that while he himself had no such document in his possession, the British GovemiiBnt had throu^i the Political Agait told him that His Majesty's Grovernment had given an assurance that they wcxild use tiieir utmost endeavour to solve Ihe Blockade question to the full satisfaction of Kuwait. The King appeared mudi interested and urged him the Shaikh to remind His Majesty # s G-orermnent day in this and day out about tbcBdcr asstirance of theirs. According to the Shaikh the King used the words ' I do not know wlat is the matter with. His Majesty^s Government these days, but they seem careless about meir promises and don't carry them out unless one continually attacks, attacks and attacks them. You my brother, must never rest or an ow -Qi em to ±*ri-g think for one mom ent that , they can get out of their solemn pledges made to the Arab Rulers, and in this matter of the Blockade you must register your protest every week until His Majesty's Government carries out its promise'. The Shaikh says that he saw in this a reference to the Date Gardens question thougji actually no words passed about this subject at all. 1 As regards (c) the King asksd what were exactly the relations between Kuwait and His Majesty's Government. Was Kuwait of h&amp;r own free will r under tlB care and protection of His Majesty 1 s aoremirBnt or was it a case of he 1he Shaikh being compelled to n toe the line'? The Shaikh replied (again according to him) that he looked upon Kuwait as a part of the British Empire, and himself as one of 1s3m King George's most loyal subjects. He had nothing to complain of at all except of the sometimes rather mistifying and slow methods of the Protecting Power. Tlle above end much more in the same line was reported to me by His Excellency and one must assume I suppose that he was not making tlsm up* I personally do not think he was , as he seemed too pleased with everything he had seen and heardt -4- lieard^and particularly with the personal charm of His Majesty the King to wish to invent© I /©o I have reported the above as they were told me , and I think you may find them at interest. I m£§r mention that the arrangements made by the local Port, Police and Customs authorities at Basrah and Fao on the Shaikh* s journey to Basrah prior to his visit to Baghdad were admirably in ihe extreme, and on behalf of His Excellency iiie Shaikh I on my return conveyed my thanks and appreciation to the Mutasarrif of Basrah and to the local Administrative Inspector. It. Nor were the Royal Air Force and especially Ko # E03 Flying Boat Squadron behind-hand in affording every kind cf assistance. Their motor boat and car arrangements for getting the Shaikh to Margil and on to the aerodrome were efficient and admirable. I have written and thanked them also for all they did. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

His Majesty icing Faisal's remarks on His Majesty's (Government, as contained in paragraph 8(b) of Colonel Dickson's letter, do not make very pleasant reading, but if they actually represent His Majesty's views it is of course an advantage that they should , be known. The Shaikh himself—as will be seen—was much pleased with his visit, and all the authorities concerned seem to have combined in a most helpful and sympathetic manner to make it a success. I am sending copies of this despafch to the Government of India and His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq# I have the honour to be. Six* Your most obedient humble servant, ''Ml h / 4^.

I leave it, therefore, to your discretion whether at a propitious tiiae you might not remind the Shai&amp;h of this fact- Anyhow, public abuse of H.M.G. and the Knglish should stop strai^tit away. I hope to pay a visit to Kuwait at the end of October and do not wish, at my first meeting as Resident with the Shaikh, to raise an unpleasant subject. It would be better therefore, I think, if you were to give him a broad hint that—though he is at liberty to speak out straight talk—his public ebullitions are most ill- timed and can only serve to prejudice him in our eyes.Wo. 26 £) of 1932. -tsritlsh Besidency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, /fdfSeptem'ber 1932. 11 Ji^ To H.iS.

I think it would be an excellent thing if he did so, and I trust you will be able to persuade him to do so.

But I daresay that what the Minister meant was that the visit should be unofficial, and the Shaikh could simply be referred to as Shaikh Ahmad As-Subah of Kuwait, and as passport formalities would be waived this point should not raise much difficulty. 4.

Section 2. : OOHFIOEHTIAL MRC8 No. 1. Consul-General Fowle to India Office.—{Communicated by India Office, January 2, 1933.) (Confidential.) THE Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, and has the honour to transmit to him a copy of his letter of the 29th November to the Foreign Secretary of the Government of India respecting a visit to Koweit in November 1932. Bushire, November 29, 1932. Enclosure in No. 1. |/Ai)- #77-3) Consul-General Fowle to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, November 29, 1932. I HAVE the honour to state that I have just returned from a visit to Koweit, where I stayed five days, and so had ample opportunity of making the acquaintance of his Excellency the Iheikh, with whom, in company with Colonel Dickson. I had many conversations. 2. I had only met his Excellency for a few hours last year, and was glad of this opportunity of getting to know him better. I was favourably impressed hy him. He is, I think, a moderately strong character, though inclined to be impulsive, and no match at ' political poker ' for that astute player His Majesty Ibn Sand—witness the incident of their interchange of letters on the subject of Nejd-Koweit claims, dealt with in my despatch No. 43 (copy to the Government of India and Jedda under my printed letter of the 17th September, 1932). His Excellency has attractive manners, and a pleasing personality. He is reported to be something of a miser (though this does not extend to his personal hospitality), but, in an impoverished State, this is no bad thing, as the late Sir Hugh Biscoe pointed out. He is, I think, genuinely loyal to us, and prefers Englishmen to other foreigners, but his loyalty has been very highly tried by what he considers our failure to assist him both in the matter of his date gardens and Ibn Saud's blockade, and there have been incidents lately—as both Colonel Dickson and I agree—which show that he is trying to ' £ keep in '' unofficially and sub rosa with both Nejd and Iraq. Nor do*! see how he can be blamed for this. If, in his opinion, His Majesty's Government will not—or cannot—fight his battles for him, he sees no way but to resort to secret diplomacy in order to placate his powerful neighbours. 3. The questions on which he feels most strongly are the two mentioned above. I found it difficult to give any satisfactory replies (that is to say, replies which would appear to him satisfactory), in answer to his queries as to why His Majesty's Government did not assist him as to the blockade vis-a-vis Ibn Saud, and as to his date gardens vis-a-vis Iraq. He stated that, in both cases, he relied on the assurances of assistance and promises of His Majesty's Government; in regard to the former, the assurances conveyed to him, following on the Secretary of State for the Colonies' telegram of the 25th July, 1929, to the Political Resident; and in regard to the latter, the promises contained in Colonel Knox's letter, dated the 14th Dhilhijjah, 1332 (the 3rd November, 1914). He pointed out that in the matter of his own blockade in 1929-30 against Ibn Dawish and the other rebels against Ibn Saud, enjoined on him by His Majesty's Government, he was helping to kill and starve into surrender tribes—the Mutair, for example— who, though nominally Ibn Saud's subjects, were from old times really under Koweit, many of whom—including Ibn Dawish himself—being old friends and [683 b—2]playmates of his. He stated with some emotion that he had received the most desperate appeals from these friends of his for assistance, which appeals it had wrung his heart to refuse. He also informed me that, at the same period, he had received confidential and urgent exhortations from the highest (Iraqi) quarters in Iraq to assist the rebels to the best of his ability in order that Ibn Saud should be definitely smashed. That they (the highest quarters) could do nothing, because of the English, but that, if he, the sheikh, would take action, they would help him secretly. And what, his Excellency asked me, had he gained by standing firm against those appeals and exhortations? Ibn Baud's blockade, instead of ceasing, had increased in severity, and was literally strangling Koweit to death. Moreover, his Excellency pointed out, his own notables in Koweit were continually attacking him on the subject of His Majesty's Government's attitude. ' You stand by the English Government,' they sneered. &lt;c What has the English Government done for you in the matter of your date gardens, or in the matter of Ibn Saud's blockade, which is now ruining us? ' 4. I cannot say that, as His Majesty's Government's local representative, I enjoyed our conversations on these subjects, or that I particularly like repeating- them for His Majesty's Government's information, but I would fail in my duty if I did not report what his Excellency's feelings are. As I have already indicated, I found it difficult to give replies to his Excellency's complaints. The line I took was twofold : First, that I would report the gist of his Excellency's views, which I have done; and second, that Koweit, placed between two more powerful neighbours, Nejd and Iraq, needed a strong friend, and that, from the long point of view, this friend was undoubtedly the British Government. His Excellency agreed with the latter dictum, and seemed to take some comfort from my reply. I cannot conceal, however, the disturbing fact that in Koweit, both with ruler and people, British prestige is on the wane, an opinion which Colonel Dickson, who is in the best position to know, fully endorses. 5. I do not wish to give the impression, however, that my conversations with his Excellency were confined to the two distressing questions mentioned above. My main object in paying a long visit to Koweit was not to find an immediate solution for its problems, which cannot be hoped for, but to establish personal and sympathetic contact with its sorely-tried ruler, and in this, with the assistance of Colonel Dickson, I think I succeeded. His Excellency and I had many conversations on more cheerful and general topics, and generally I think we established mutually cordial relations. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. / I have, &amp;c. T. C. FOWLE, Lieut.-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. fry sit-s Wrh' JiA*'XL.

The paper in question, I believe is controlled by the party of which His Excellency Yasin Pasha is the head. 5. ployed by IRAQ in her steady attack on Kuwait; and is more subtle than the 'bull in the china shop' methods of Bin Saud, the other aspirant to Kuwait and her favours. 4 Clearly IRAQ, believes in threatening, and making herself unpleasant, so to speak, with her right hand, while offering peace and the olive branch with her left. This is a form of moral suasion well known among ^.rabs and the East generally. 5, While I say it with caution, I should imagine the article to be an inspired one, and forms another link in the chain of steady pressure, which has been«• 2 been and continues to be brought to bear on the principality of Kuwait for obvious reasons. 6, Nor should it be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait , like most Eastern Rulers, is especially susceptible to Newspaper attacks, whatever form they take. 7. The present article bears a distinct resemblance to the very interesting ones, published by Ismail Hakki, Deputy for Baghdad, which appeared in the Turkish news paper, 'Tanin' of December 24th, December 26th and Decauber 28th in 1910, vide Mr.Marlins despatch to the Hon'ble Sir dated -Irt n n Edward Grey, No. 15 ^Constantinople, the 4th January 1911, copies of which you will find, I think, in your Bushire 8. Perhaps history is about to repeat itself more closely than we think# archives I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, w Lt•-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait TSSA SUGGESTION YOU UNITING- IRAQ AND KUWAIT&gt; Who is that person who doubts that Kuwait to Iraq, is like a younger brother to his elder, and isho is there, who does not believe that Kuwait at the present moment stands more than at any time/ in her previous his tory, in need of a sincere brother, who would extend his helping hands in education and training, and who is there who does not perceive the necessity for uniting the prince dom of Kuwait with Iraq, thereby becoming a model, and a good model too, which other Arab kingdoms and princedcms can copy with advantage# Until yesterday Kuwait was a part - and a non- separable part - of the Basrah Liwa, Prior to the Great War the colour on the map of the town of Kuwait was similar to that of Basrah. Whoever visited this town in days gone by, or in recent years could not but feel the strong re lationship that binds these two places to one another. The city of Kuwait and at its head H.E.Sir Ahmed al Jabir al- Subah entertains with love and respect the progress made by her elder brother, Iraq. They (Kuwaitians) long for Iraqian news and read her papers. Before they go througb any article in the paper, they read the heading lest perhaps they might come across a thing written about Iraq, and when found, it is read before any other topic. The sound of telegrams is echoed in Kuwait in half an hou^s time, and letters reach there within four hours by post. Experience and the existing state of affairs have both proved that Kuwait grieves at our sorrows, laughs at our happiness, and lives again on hearing of Iraq's revival. Incidents have also taught us that this brotherly Trrlnce ^oia has suffered as we have in those stormy days- 2 - days and has 'borne her sufferings as we have.. Private and public news echo in Kuwait, the sound of Iraq's complaints about the iniquity of the convention - and her news told us, at the time, how the Kuwaitians groaned and were unhappy at our grief and sorrow* Their feelings are not of to-day or of yesterday, nay, they have existed for years long gone by, this lively feeling has been in existence amongst Kuwait's Simirs and her townspeople ever since the formation of the principality under its prince the Al-Subalu This fellow feeling|Ls the outcome of common necessity and the sufferings of both parties* Family connections between us both are numerous. Each one is sufficient enough to unite and make of us one nation. Our relationship with this brotherly princedom is based on one religion, the same language, customs and man ners, in addition to the fact that we have one and the same aim in life f/ lastly geographically we stand the same. What the Kuwaiti says the Iraq, understands, what the Iraq adopts the Kuwaiti follows, what is complained of by the Iraqi, is likewise complained of bitterly by the Kuwaiti. Were we to unite and join together we would become a power that could not be repulsed, seeing that we have determination to claim our rights.* Our brethem the Kuwaitians have experienced certain incidents that have happened quite re cently and now know that separation from us is undesirable, they have discovered that had they been a part of a strong government with her aeroplanes, army and fighting equipment they ?/ould not have suffered such a heavy casualty roll and loss of so many youths, within the very walls of Kuwait whilst defending the Emirate. ThJ:s, our nation now feels it necessary to support and aid her brother the Kuwaiti an. Iraq/- 3 - Iraq, and her people feel that to conie and defend the Kuwaitian can no longer be avoided. This feeling first had its inception in the brains and the hearts, but now the time for action has come. The Iraq Nation would be blameworthy, were it not to render a helping hand, and coni- bine her efforts with those of her brother. Readers remember that the recent visit paid by His excellency Shaikh Ahmed El Jabir to his great capital, Baghdad* His Excellency very well remembers how the Iranians met and welcomed him, and if that reception has left a good impression on him I would add one more thing, laamely that if His Excellency cares to open the hearts of Iranians, young and old, he will see nothing but deep admiration for him. Although it is only recently that His Excellency has been chosen to sit on the throne of this princedom, yet wonderful progress has already been made in his town and among his people. It is also known to us how His Excellency longs to seize the opportunity for strengthening the relationship between the two countries by intermarriages between Kuwatis and Iraqis, thereby uniting the two, so that the Customs barrier, founded by the ' dividing' foreigner should be once for all removed, also that differences and passport formalities should be done away with, resulting in the flags of both nations being hoisted side by side on build ings and palaces, and so enabling the Arabs to leap the first barrier that prevents progress and prosperity.n&gt; COMFIDEMTlAL . 110.588 -3 of 1933.

SUBJECT t Iraqi interest in Kuwait. Sir, I have tiie honour to enclose herewith a trans la tion of an article, sent me by the Political Agent,Kuwait which appeared in the Baghdad newspaper: AL-AKHA-UL- WATMI (Brothers of the Homeland) under the date 20th Moharram 1552 (15th May 1935). 2. Colonel Dickson believes that the paper in question is controlled by Yasin Pasha's party, and draws an interesting parallel between this article and those which,written by Ismail Hakki, then Deputy for Baghdad, and a prominent member of the Committee of Union and Progress, appeared in the Turkish newspaper TAHIH, on December 24th, December 26th, and December 28th, 1910, vide Sir Charles Marling 1 s Despatch from Constantinople Mo.15 of 4th January 1911 to Sir Edward Grey. The gist of these articles, in so far as they concern Kuwait, was that Kuwait really belonged to Turkey, and was a part of the/the Wilayet of BagJidad, but timt irith the assistance of British intrigues its Shaikh (at that time Mubarak as-Subah) had Engineered himself into a position of semi-independence. That Kuwait was a centre for arms smuggling to the Arab tribes - within and without the Wilayet • hostile to the Turkish Gorernment, and that it must be blockaded by sea and land. That the Shaikh had 'valuable property in the shape of date gardens in the Basrah SAKJAK, which put a weapon in the hands of the Baghdad authorities for bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh. That if methods of pressure failed the ^seditious existence*' of Kuwait might have to be put an end to by the coup de main of a military occupation* 3. It will be observed that various of the Kuwaiti- Iraqi problems of to-day are mentioned in Ismail Hakki's articles, i.e. a claim that Kuwait should come under the administration of Baghdad, which I imagine the Iraq tfoTern- ment of to-day would not be loath to advance if they saw an 1^, opportunity; smuggling - but nowadays of goods not of arms, (ride my letter ilo.569-S of 29th May 1933 to His Majesty's Amb as sad or, Baghdad, copy forwarded to His Majesty' Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India under my Printed letter Ho.570-S of 29th May 1935); blockade measures - which the Iraq Government wish now to impose with the co-operation of the Shaikh; and the Shaikh 1 d date gardens in the Basrah district. 4. Too great attention need not be paid to the productions of the Iraqi Press. It is of some interest, however, to ffellow the line pursued in the AL-AKHA-UL- WATAKI article. Up to the Great War Kuwait was part of the/*v * hp ,u l(oH? the Basrah Liro, and Kuwaitis and Iraqis as 'the outcome of common necessity and the sufferings of both parties* 1 are entirely sympathetic to one another, besides the fact that there are many family connections between the two. 11 Our 'brethren the Kuwaitians have experienced certain incidents H that have happened quite recently and now know that separa- 'tion from us is undesirable, they have discovered that had 'they been a part of a strong government with her aeroplanes, 'army and fighting equipment they would not have suffered such 'a heavy casualty roll and loss of so many youths, within the 'very walls of Kuwait whilst defending the Emirate.' A broad hint that if Kuwait had been part of Iraq Bin Saud would not have been able to blockade and overrun Kuwait territory. The article refers to the visit of His Excellency the Shaikh to Baghdad, (see my despatch Ho.41 to His Majesty 1 b Secretary of State for the Colonies, copy forwarded to the Government of India and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq under my printed letter iio.654-S, dated the 12th September 1932), where he met with &amp; warm welcome, and concludes by saying that he longs to remove the Customs barrier,'founded by tne dividing foreigner', between tne two peoples, so that the flags of both nations may fly side by side on buildings and palaces# 5. There is no fear nowadays, of course, of a coup de maijQ by the Iraq Government such as might have been attempted against Kuwait by the Turks. We must, however, I think expect a certain amount of underground intrigue and pressure from Baghdad with a view to the 'unification' of the two countries. The Toreign Office indeed -enly recently expreesed some/4&lt; some appreliension with regard to tiie intention of King Feisal of visiting Kuwait, (vide Mr* Rendel's letter 6555/6054/ 91, dated the 29th December 1932, to Sir Francis Humphrys) f and in my letter K0.557-S of 25rd May 1933 I ventured to suggest that His Majesty might be informed that before visiting Kuwait he should intimate his intention of doing so through the proper channel, i.e. the British Ambassador* Secretary of State for India and His Majesty^ Ambassador, Baghdad* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Resident in the Persian G-ulfCONFIDENTIAL.

I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter Ko:C/245-6/7 dated tlie 2nd July 1933 to Dickson about some ill-advised remarks of Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir, while on his visit here. I am sorry to say that a Shaikh Ahmad trades on his own veneer of western civilization to poke fun at Shaikh Hamad whenever he can.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a translation of an article which appeared in the Arab newspaper 'THAGHR' of Basra on the 8th August 1933, article is of interest, as showing the Shaikh's anxiety to keep on good terms with his Iraqi neighbours these days. I gather the aEticle was inspired by the Shaikh, who himself drew my attention to it# He also told me the name of the man who sent it. This person is a sort of hanger on and poet, at the Shaikh's Court. My supposed thanks and grateful remarks to H.M's Charge d'Affaires and the Iraq Prime Minister really reflects the Shaikh's own feelings for he was most pleased when I told him of my interview with the Prime Minister and was deeply touched, when I delivered Rachid Ali Qailani's message about the Fao Estates.

' (3) News of He j d and Yemena. jrom our spe cial Correspondent . On the occasion of H.M. King Faisal's return to the Capital of his Kingdom on 5rd August His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait telegraphed an affectionate message congratulating him on his safe arrival with read as follows:- ^Baghdad. His Majesty K^ng Faisal the Magnified. I congratulate Your Majesty on your safe arrival # I pray that health and pleasure be your portion all your life tr . Ahmed as-Subah. He received the following reply:- Kuwait# r_is -Excellency Ahmed as-Subah, Thank you, I wish you a successful future'# Faisal. The two messages which have been exchanged between H .M. the King of Iraq, the great leader of the Arabs, and His Excellency the Amir of Kuwait, are positive proof of the great and Reciprocal friendship which exist between the Arabs' King and their Amirs. When the Hashemi passenger left Baghdad for the English xietropolis in compliance with the invitation of the King Emperor, His Excellency our Amir took great interest in his movements, and all along hoped that success and pleasure would attend the visit of the King and his good companions. His Excellency felt the greatest delist and joy whenever he read the news regarding the banquets, etc., that ?/ere given in His;8 S His Majesty's honour in the Anglo-Saxon capital. If His Excellency takes such interest in the movements of H.M. Faisal the First, the saviour, and in the future of our Arab hopes, and he is outstanding in this respect, then we pray that his.efforts may be crowned with success and bliss at all times. His Excellency Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, the British Political Agent at Kuwait, left for Baghdad by one of the Imperial Airways* aeroplanes on a private and important matter, and His Excellency returned to Kuwait by one of the same company's planes. His Excellency was treated as a special guest during his stay in Baghdad, both by the Prime Minister, H.E. Reshid Ali Beg al-Kailani, and H.E. the acting British Ambassador, and is grateful for the kind welcome and hospitality wh^ih he received . He also thanks hisnhosts for the facilities given him in accomplishing his important work. He is. especially grate ful to His Excellency the Prime Minister Al-Kailany for the message of friendship and respects which he sent to A His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait. We do not regard it as too much from the Kailany and his friends the Iraqis if they on all occasions show their affection and respects for the A1 as-Subah, because these brave men are the leaders of the Arab New World and are its chiefs. They confirm their place in the hearts of the nation and prove their merit and competence. * Not sent with this on account of its length.9y Confidential .

' Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information and that of His Majesty's G-overnment, a translation of an article which appeared in the Baghdad newspaper the al WATANI' of the 20th August 1933. The reference to Kuwait joining up with IRAQ, politically and economically, is interesting, I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, \ 'Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent,Kuwait^ 0 Translation of an article which aPDeared in the Baghdad paper ' Ikha al Watani^ of 20th August 1955 T THE STATE OF KIT.7ATT . Importance of the State - Contentions raised on account of it - The struggle of Oil Development Companies - The construction of buildings for the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and its good effect on labour in Kuwait and Basra - The progress of Companies in Kuwait - The Imper\aive need for the youth of Iraq to emigrate to Kuwait # Kuwait is an Arab State, which occupies a large area, and is situated on the western coast of the Gulf of Basra (the Persian Gulf). It is of great political importance, and has always been the goal of western politicians. Perhaps it was one of those 'Keys' of communications which hastened on the great war, the flames of which as we know devoured the green with the dry. It, however, cannot escape the notice of those who keep a close study on the remarkable rise of this Arab State, that most of the treaties, which have been concluded between certain statesmen, with regard to the route to India, the safety of the British Empire and the liberty of trade and navigation in the Gulf have been greatly influenced by the position of this State, it being situated at a junction of routes and capable of being turned into a strategical strong-hold provi ding power and supplies. Mow that the atmosphere has become clear, and the heavy clouds have disappeared from the horizon of political struggle, certain business men of financial and economical standing, have approached the Ruler of the State, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, with a view to get a concession for theml the development of oil, which, aooording to the reports of geologists, Is abundant in his State, and they are now after a great deal of competition, making final represen tations to the Ruler for the uncovering of the natural treasures which lie hidden under the ground of that State. The above competition, it appears, has reached the final stages, the two oil companies, being amongst the greatest oil companies of the world, namely the Iraq Petrol Company on the one side, and the Company as represented by Lord Weymess on the other. The bidding between the rivals will shortly be brought to a conclusion by the announce ment of the name of one of the two companies as the winning party that is to develop the natural tresures of the State. Seeing that Kuwait is likely to become very important in the oil world, and understanding the bright and promising future which lies before it, the British Government have decided to make it the centre of their policy in the Gulf by moving their Political Residency from its old position in Bushire, , ika to the Principality of Kuwait. The Political Resident, or, more precisely, the head of all Political Agents in the Gulf Ports, has already arranged for the construction of a large and excellent building for his residence on the sea-shore in Kuwait, for which more than one million bricks have up to date been transported from Basrah, and which has provided work for many masons and labourers, ianik both in Kuwait and Basra. As we see this strong development in the direc tion of Kuwait, and witness its effect on the progress of that State, which indeed gives us very great pleasure to record, we can also perc%ve the kindly feelings which His Excellency the Ameer (the Shaikh of Kuwait) bears his brethren the people of Iraq, as shown in the recent faci lities accorded by him to an Iraqian Company for the1^ mfi the establishment of a company in Kuwait under the name of the 'Kuwait Electrification Company', as well as the patronage and encouragement which he has given it. All this gives us a clear picture of the powerful influences which are at work to link that State, morally and spiritually with its Sister the Iraq. Someday, it may^ be that Kuwait will be Joined with Iraq both politically and economically. Pray God that this may happen in the near future. The abovementioned Company having received the necessary patrofcage and assistance from His Excellency the Ameer (the Shaikh of Kuwait), attempted to give satisfaction by providing Kuwait with electric current at an early date, the idea being to make it the bride of the Gulf, after it had acquired a high position in the world of economics. The near future will no doubt disclose tj&amp; us its importance in matters commercial, as well as prove the good prospects that await the State in the field of business and economics. We reveal no secret, when we say that the increase ?fhich has occurred in the size of the popula tion of the State during the last five years, and the large buildings which have been constructed, not to speak of the establishment of great companies^xscf branch offices in Kuwait, all leads us to believe that the projects which are being undertaken there will succeed. Moreover the successful progress of the Iraq-Kuwait Company (the Kuwait Electrification Co.) contributes to this our belief, and makes us hopeful and expectant, t As we write this, we feel pity for the large number of unemployed youths of Baghdad who are unaware of this rich State near them and are neglecting the privilege of their close relationship to it: a relation ship cemented by blood, religion, proximity and business, and which invites the youth of Iraq to join their otherother home, Kuwait. Kuwait indeed is in dire need of persons who can promote the standard of education in it, for youth to add their efforts to those of their colleagues in Kuwait, and lastly for youth to emigrate and become a lasting link between the youth of Irac[ and the youth of Kuwait, The benefits which would result from such an auspicious movement are too great to be defin&amp;d^ His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait, who is well known for his patronage to learning, and 7/ho bears for this country (Iraq) a sincere and hearty affection which had been proved by his last visit to his other home •* the Iraq, will no doubt regard this our essay with the encouraging look of a man who desires to take advantage of such strong connections and hopes to make of Iraq and ^uwait a united country linked together by their common interests of blood, religion and neighbourhood.

(450/2/33) BRITISH MB ASSY, BAGDAD. 23rd BoTember, 1933. Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of an enquiry which I have received from the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the date of the institution of Kuwaiti and Bahraini nationality. This is a question of some complexity and I have thought it well to consult you before making a reply. 2. In the Anglo-Turkish Agreement signed in July 1913 the Ottoman Government renounced all claims to Bahrain but retained suzerainty over the territory of Kuwait. This Agreement was not ratified and I assume, therefore, that its provisions cannot be held ever to have become operative. 3. If this is so, the inhabitants of both Kuwait and Bahrain remained technically Ottoman subjects until the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne on 6th August, 1924, when, under the provisions of Article 3, both States were finally and completely detached from Turkey, From that datej under Article 30, the inhabitants of these detached territories became 'nationals of the State to which such territory is transferred^. Hence it would appear that the date of the creation of both Kuwaiti and Bahraini nationality is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O. , /4. etc. , etc., etc.• 2 - -^1 @ 4. There remains the matter of the Persian Governinent * s claim to sovereignty over Bahrain, but as this claim is not recognised 'by His Majesty's Government, it is presumably unnecessary to take it into consideration in replying to the Iraqi Government. 5.

I have the honour to forward (a) English translation of three similarly worded articles, which appeared under the name of one 'Omar al Taibi', simultaneous ~ly 'the Arabic newspapers, (i) The'Ath Thighr' of Basra (No.272) under date 31st January 1934; (ii) tt Al Akha al Watni* of Baghdad (No»554, under date 31st January 1934; J (iii) 'Fat al Arab n of Damascus (No,.3510) under date 30 th January 1934; (b) English translation of a letter No.R3/l433 ) dated the 9th February 1934, from His Excel lency the Shaikh of Kuwait to myself drawing attention to the articles in question and asking His Majesty's G-oTernment to lodge a formal protest to both the 'Iraq and Syrian GoFernments 2. Both the articles and His Sxcellency the Shaikh's letter speak for themselres and so nedd no further word of explanation from me. 3. His Excellency the Shaikh takes a very serious view the articles, which from the fact that they appeared on thetSSilWfcJ on th® 30th and 31st of January respectively in -phe three ^ most important tgwns of the Middle 'East (Damascus, Baghdad and Basra) clearly prove them to be inspiredo. 4» The writer of the articles is, I understand, a Syrian who at the moment is residing in ^raq and has recently spent much of his time making sundry mysterious - not to say suspicious - journeys between Baghdad and Basra• 5* His Excellency is of opinion that certain influential persons in Baghdad of set purpose got the man to publish the articles under his name, shortly before the date fixed for the 'Kuwait - ^raq Smuggling Conference' (the 15th and 16th February 19 34), as part cf the deliberate propaganda which is now going forward in 'Iraq against Kuwait, and with a view possibly to influence the course of the discussions^ 6* Whether the Shaikh is right or wrong in this assumption is immaterial, but the object of the letter, which incidentally is grossly incorrect and misleading in several important respects, is clearly intended to convey to the public and especially the Kuwait public, the idea that 'Kuwait within the 'Iraq fold will be happy and prosperous, but as an independent State will continue to be attacked and subjected to every form of pressure and ignominy'* 7« His Excellency put it scmewhat ironically in the course of his conversation with me (when he brought me the newspapers in question to see)» His words were as near as I can remember, as follows. 'There is little doubt that 'Iraq's policy to-day is to show her teeth and bite me one day, and the next day to fawn, and offer the advantages of peace, all with the one eventual idea of coercing my State and forcing me to come within her fold. At the same time 'Iraq clearly does not wish to be too forceful in her methods, as this she knows will upset His Majesty's G-ovemment who, it/3 - &lt;2 / ? @ it is hoped, may be 'used 1 * diplomatically to further her (^Iraq^) ends in this particular matteri 8. It is interesting to note in passing that the writer of the 'article' makes the naive admission (end of first para) out of the Shaikh, by discarding the old Turkish Taxation system, and 'replacing it with the one known as the Istahlak Procedure'. The implication being that by means of the new method they were able to 'hoodwink' His Majesty's Government. 9. This we have always maintained here in Kuwait, although the Shaikh has gone a step further and believes that the t Iraq Government will go back to the old Turkish system, as soon as they have successfully settled the whole Date Garden business, as between themselves. His Majesty's if Government and Kuwait - vide my Confidential Despatch No -270, dated the 9th November 193S # , 10, In this matter of the similarity of present day 'Iraq's propaganda to that of the Turkish Government, prior to 1914, I would once again draw your attention to my Confidential Despatch No. 105, dated the 20th May 1933 and your Confidential Letter N q .588- S , dated the 1st June 1933 to the Government of India. 11 # I trust that His Excellency the Shaikhs letter, together with my letter and enclosure (a) will be forwarded to the proper quarters, with a view to a strong protest being made and in order that adequate steps may be taken to prevent publication of such articles in future. that the 'Iraq Government only succeeded in getting taxes I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, ' Lt.-Colonel, Poli ti ca1 Agent,Kuwa it VSS.•in thp «Ath art icle whiGli appeared simultaneously January 19^ ^^Sasra, No• 272, dated the Slst ^ + t U f ^ atni ne?/spaper of Baghdad, No» 554, dated the 51st January 19S4, and the 'Fatal-Arab»» newsDar of Damascus, No^3510, dated the 50th January 1934, and was signed by one Omar al Talbl under the following titles: THE EOSIHON OF KUWAIT. 'KUWAIT SHOULD INEVITABLY BE ANNEXED BY' 'IBAQ,? 'WHY IS NOT KUWAIT ANNEXED BY 'IRAQ'. 'A MATTER BETWEEN KUWAIT AH) 'IRAQ'. During the Turkish dominion over 'Iraq, Kuwait was regarded as one of the subordinate provinces of Basra, and Its rulers of the present as-Sabah family were considered to be Ottoman Governors. They themselves always made manifest their respect to this Ottoman Qependeney, and on this basis they were allowed to possess vast date gardens and many landed properties, both in Basra town and in its environs, thus establishl/ai themselves amongst the greatest landlords of Basra. The land taxes, which the Turkish Authorities used to levy from them on their properties within the Basra Wilayat, exceeded six lacs of rupees, and the British Govern ment, soon after the outbreak of the World Great War, promised to exempt them from this, if they (the Al Sabah) helped her in the occupation of Basra. This they did. Similarly the British Government also promised to exempt Khazal Khan, the Ruler of Mohammerah, and now member of the Persian Parliament, from the sum of four lacs of rupees, which he had to pay every year to the Turkish Authorities as land tax on the properties which be possessed at Basra, on the grounds that he was an Ottoman subject, and Mohammerah a Turkish dependency, ^.fter the occupation of Basra, the British Government carried out her promises to both rulers for a couple of vear.^ - i^spite °f the clamours of the 'Iraqlan Chamber of Deputies, but the Iraq Government at last succeeded in collecting their land/- 2 - land taxes on the properties of both, by the method of cancelling the old Turkish System of colleoting taxes, and replacing it by a new one known as the 'Istahlak Tax Procedure' &lt;2 Under the circumstances which we have mentioned above, it should have been possible for the British Govern ment of the time to have helped in the annexation of Kuwait by ♦Iraq on the understanding that the rulership should remain in the hands of the A1 Sabah imiirs. Had this been effected, Kuwait, in view of its excellent geographical position, would have beccme a first rate sea port and harbour for 'Iraqp and Kuwait and ♦Iraq together would have derived equal advantage at one and the same time. \ However, Kuwait has now got a good and direct connection in the Posts and Telegraphs Service, ^ich is being carried on in Kuwait by the latter. The people of Kuwait themselves desire very sincerely that they should be annexed to ♦Iraq and the present ruler of Kuwait, we belive, approves of this annexation also, because it will disentangle him from many difficulties, which arise frequently between him and Nejd on the question of the t *Musabalah n and the demands (by Nejd) of a share in the Customs duties. Moreover, the people of Kuwait as we lias the people of 'Iraq are both owners of extensive properties and flourishing businesses in each others countries. Most of the motor cars, which now ply between Basra and Kuwait, for instance, belong to 'Iraqis and the town of Kuwait is illuminated with electricity by a Kuwait - 'Iraq Electric Supply Co., in which the people of Basra have.: got many shares. A^lso the Port Directorate at Basra, which is rigfttly a legitimate property of the 'Iraq Government, itself controls the harbour of Kuwait, at which more steamers call than at Basra. It would be a good deed, therefore, if a Kuwait- 'Iraq Commission were to be set up, with a view to bringing about the annexation of Kuwait by 'Iraq. The advantagesadvantage of such a settlement would then be veiy great, and would certainly be In the Interests of both countries^ 1 „ Translation of a letter No.R3/l433. dated the 24th Shauwal 1352 (9th February 1934), from His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., G.S.I. Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent. Kuwait. After Compliments, We beg to draw your attention to the fact that the iraqian jress have lately assumed towards us an attitude, of which the least that can be said is that it seems to have been designed, and deftoitely intended for purposes, whicli I fail to comprehend. 7. However, being as I am. ardently and ever desirous preserve good and friendly relations with my neighbours in general, and with 'Iraq m particular. I should be grateful if you would kindly draw the att§ntion of those concerned. to the boastful newspaper articles which we are wont to frequently read nowadays in -Iraqian newspapers and which under prominent and sensational headlines seem bent on disturbing the friendly and amicable relations which exist between neighbours. - Had there been a word of truth in the matters discussed and dealt with, I should have overlooked ttee editorial efforts, but in very fact they are entirely devoid of truth. | ^ 1 do not propose to deal with each article separately ^ nor can I now. but as an example I would merely mention f those articles which recently appeared in the 'Al Ahali' l^^Paper of Baghdad (already reported to you) dealing with [ our date gardens and properties, by an unknown correspondent, who tried to distort and hide the true facts; also the articL. which was published by one Omar al Tabi. a Syrian by birth an editor in the 'Eat al Arab' newspaper of Damascus econtly came to 'Iraq) in three newspapers simultaneously and under different titles, though the subject was one and the sane / S3..E~ &gt;7 the same. This article appeared in the tt Fat al Arab ft newspaper of Damascus, under date 30th January 1934, and was entitled, ^miy is Kuwait not annexed to f Iraq ft ; also in the ^Akha^ newspaper of Baghdad, dated the 31st January 1934, under the heading 'The Annexation of Kuwait to 'Iraq', and finally in the n Ath Thigjir' newspaper of Basra, (dated the 31st January 1934), under the title, 'The Matter between Kuwait and 'Iraq'. b In the above mentioned article the writer has dealt with this supposed annexation idea in a manner which reveals an attempt ^ at pure propaganda obviously with the evil purpose of prostituting the true facts, and sowing the seeds of hatred between our adjoining countries. Had such writings as these reached us from beyond the seas, or from far distant countries, we should have not been very surprised; but the constant publishing of these wicked and scurrilous articles in the press of 'Iraq causes us the greatest astonishment. How is it possible for responsible men in organised government like that of 'Iraq to allow certain individuals, who have no idea of truth, to try and traduce the good name of their neighbours and insult them a without reason. [ Our intention, however, is not to discover the motive or object underlying these writings, but rather to make protest and show our contempt for methods which we cannot pass over in silence, whoever the real author may be. ly Lastly the ppearance of such false/inspired stories written by an 'Iraqi at one t irne ) and by a Syrian at another, compel us to protest most strongly against the writer and with deep insistence we would ask that you kindly write to the proper authorities concerned, and request them to bring such vicious propaganda to an end, and thus preserve the spirit of frinedship which we above all wish should continue^ Usual Ending.CONFIDENTIAL NO.D.0.C-5U I ■j'% (ft POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT.

Armor plate is recognized to be the most efficient protection. Our principals, Henry Bisston &amp; Sons, Inc., are pioneer steel makers with a century of actual fine steel making experience# JHsston tools are known and used the world over and the renown of Bisston tools is due to the quality of Bisston steels. After exhaustive research, after years of study and extensive experi mentation, BISSTOK IMFEKETEA, light armor plate was developed - the acme in the art of steel making. Its unusual qualities are due to successful steel alloying, together with new methods of heat treatment developed and perfected in the Bisston laboratories. It has withstood most severe firing tests for its respective thicknesses. The use of armor plate for army, navy, aviation and police services is in its infancy. It is being employed for rifle butts (back plates of targets), for protecting troop and transport cars, for war tanks, for protecting artillery on land, for wheelhouses on gunboats, breast plates, etc. New uses are being discovered daily, as the extreme ef fectiveness of protection of BISSTON IMPBKETRA armor plate is being realized.

I To meet this necessity he sought a steel better than any that could be bought in the United States or in [Europe at that time. He turned to crucible steel as the [solution of his problem; to get it he built his own furnaces and mastered the art of crucible melting. In 1855, Henry Disston melted the first crucible saw steel in this country—a pioneering achievement in the jliistory of fine steel making! From that day to this DISSTON crucible steel has been the symbol of quality— not only in DISSTON products but in tool and special jsteels throughout the steel-using world. [ Again, in 1906, recognizing the growing need for Icrucible steel in larger heats, but without any sacrifice of crucible quality, DISSTON pioneered. At the DISSTON plant, before a group of prominent metallurgical engineers, was cast the first commercial heat of ELECTRIC TOOL [STEEL made in America. [ That original CRUCIBLE-ELECTRIC Steel—made in jcrucible practice, from raw materials of crucible purity— melted and refined for the first time by the electric current— lorms the quality background for our present practice in king DISSTON FINE STEELS. It takes enthusiasm, love of the art, loyalty and Iminutious cooperation to make for perfection. Love of pe art, loyalty and enthusiastic cooperation of steel pker with metallurgist produced, after many years of careful study and laborious experimentations, DISSTON IMPENETRA ARMOR PLATE—the acme of the art of steel making, the last word in steel and armor plate quality. Because of its unmatched quality, its texture, its care ful rolling, its faultlessly clean surface and, last but not least, its high efficiency and resistance in shooting tests, it is specified and preferred by the most progressive governments. The use of armor plate is in its infancy. Army, navy, aviation and police administrations realize now that it takes twenty-one years and more to produce an effective combatant and only a fraction of a second to extinguish his life. The protection of man's life is coming to the forefront in progressive leaders' minds. The best protection of the life of the fighter, regard less of cost, is the cheapest. DISSTON Impenetra Armor Plate is the best pro tection. DISSTON Impenetra Armor Plate is rolled in thick nesses of .025'' and heavier. The heavier thicknesses are used for many army, navy, aviation and police purposes, as for instance for: rifle butts (the back plates of targets), for lining troop and transport cars, for war tanks, protecting artillery on land, for covering wheelhouses on gun boats, for breast plates, for lining gasoline tanks, cowls and other parts of airplanes, etc. The .025' strips rolled in lYl' to 2' widths are used for the making of bullet proof garments, such as vests, leg and knee protectors, aviators' caps, etc. OTTO KAFKA INCORPORATED AK 2 RECTOR STREET, NEW YORK CABLE ADDRESS: OTTOKAF ALL CODES USEDRear View of Plate After Firing Shooting tests on Yi' DISSTON IMPENETRA armor plate: Nine shots with United States 30 caliber A.

War Departments of many nations today are faced with the necessity of solving this problem with greatly reduced appropriations. DISSTON TRACTOR-TANKS are presented as a solution. These armored tractors embody in design and construction of armor enclosure the latest United States army tank practice and specifications. They are highly efficient, offensive weapons for use during civil disturbances, or as extremely effective equipment for police units in dispersing mobs, patrolling streets, breaking down street barricades, quelling riots or in any police work where a real show of force is required. The armor plate can be detached and the tractor used for agricultural purposes, public works, or general army or police hauling, but may quickly be converted back into a completely armored and armed tank. DISSTON Six Ton Tractor-Tank provides for the mounting of machine guns and intermediate caliber quick-fire guns and also toxic gas equipment.'DISSTON' SIX TON TRACTOR-TANK THE NEWEST, THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND MOST EFFICIENT COMBINATION WAR AND POLICE AND PEACE MACHINE The Disston Tractor-Tank is designed for various purposes: For War As an offensive weapon the tank provides for a gun, such as the 37 millimeter shown mounted in the rear compartment. See page 3. It has a 360 degree traverse allowing un restricted fire in all directions, an 80 degree elevation for firing at airplanes, snipers ir overhead positions, and other high angle work. It is capable of 15 degrees depression. Th« ring mount permits retracting the gun below the sides when passing through wooded section' or when the gun is not in use. A sling seat is provided for the operator. An additional turret for a machine gunner, observer, or ammunition passer is providec on the left side of the tank. The photographs-show a rifle caliber machine gun installed witl the latest design of ball mount. The windows in this turret are the same as those in the driver' turret and can be used as rifle or pistol ports. The driver and machine gunner are separated from the rear compartment if the mail turret is not roofed. They are completely shut off by a hinged armor bulkhead. The tractor-tank is equipped, if desired, with a giant military candle filled with smoke tear or vomiting gas. For General Army and Police Use With or without guns the tank can be used as an armored transport, or for hauling traile|| loads. By removing the gun from the rear compartment, space is available for six men i addition to the driver. This space is protected from gun fire. With or without guns the Disston Tractor-Tank can be used to: Haul artill ery. Carry supplies to an advanced or beleagured position. Relieve exhausted personnel. Bring in fresh units. Evacuate wounded. Provide a safe means of reconnaissance for general officers who may wish to inspe the immediate zone of action. With sending or receiving sets it can be utilized to report back observation ar fire control data. Offers protection in crossing terrain swept by hostile fire. Protection for police in quelling serious strikes, riots or mobs. Breaking up civil disturbances by tearing through barricades or by use of tear gas pressure tanks or giant candles carried in rear well. For Use On Public Works and Farms The armor plate and armament can be removed and the tractor can be used for genei municipal and agricultural work.

It is perhaps also of some significance that only recently - vide His Majesty's Ambassador, Bap^ad's letter No t 739 of S3rd Kovember 1933, received under India Office Printed Letter No 8361/33 - the 'Iraq Government made an enquiry as to the dates on i?hich the 'Kuwait nationality and the Bahrain nationality were constituted, and also the date on which each of these two nationalities was separated from Ottoman nationallty rt . 3« f 'he date of the publication of the article „ 31st January, when the ''Smuggling Conference at Baghdad was in the air, T)erhapo has some further significance, and the Bhaikh's objection to the Conference may have been oartly due to the sugrestion in paragraph 5, that a Kuwalt-'Iraq Commission should be set up with a view to bringing about the annexation of Kuwait by 'Iraq. The Bhaikh should have known of course th? t the Conference in question had nothing to do with annexation, but being intensely suspicious of the * Iraq Government perhaps this had some effect on his mind. In this connection please see Paragraph 5 of the Political Agent's letter. 4. In addition to its main thesis, It will be notl ced/noticed that the article refers at some length to the Shaikhs of Khwait and Mohaianerah 1 s date gardens in Basrah, (paragraph l)^ and states: '♦After the occupation of Basra, the British Government carried out her promises to both Rulers for a couple of years, in spite of the clamours of t e * Iraqi an Chamher of deputies, hut the 'Iraq Government at last succeeded in collecting their land taxes on the properties of both, by the method of cancelling the old Turkish system of collecting taxes, and replacing it by a ne^ one known as the ♦♦Istahlak r ax Procedure'. Personally I find it difficult to believe on financial grounds that the 'Iraq Government changed their revenue system merely in order to collect land taxes on the properties of the Bhai khs.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose translation of an article which appeared in the Arab newspaper rr Al Akha al Watni 11 of Baghdad (No.655) under date 11 th February 19 54. 2* No comments of mine are necessary, but needless to say it has given great offence to both His Excellency and his subjects. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J K* 3 Lt.-Colonel, Polit ical Agent,Kuwait,Translation of an article which appeared in the 'Al Akha al Watni* newspaper of Baghdad, No.653, dated the llth February 1934, r i R A q . and THS COM-RABAM) TRAFFIC. A merchant from Basra writes in the ttk Saut-al- Sha'b* newspaper as follows n Smuggling is one of the worst blights that have befallen ^raq. in the last few years* It has caused much harm to souls and property. The •Iraq aovernment will never be able to exterminate this dangerous pestilence, whose roots have become deeply fixed in the soil of T Iraq, h no matter how great their efforts and persistence or how clever their methods be. The only way to abolish this pestilence is to radically reduce the customs duties and bring them down to a level that will make smugglers activites an unpaying proposition. If the 'Iraq Govern- K*(' ment will/admit of or yield to this solution, they will never succeed in the suppression of this destructive movement. d The Customs Department in 'Iraq have been paralyze( in the last few years. Their resources have dried up, and their income has greatly diminished. Yet smuggling parties still traverse the desert in great numbers, and make their way to the land of r Iraq in safety. They have moreover managed by their daring to reach the most northern limits of the country carrying their contraband. In con sequence the merchants and traders of 'Iraq are suffering great losses which it is difficult to make up for. If conditions remain as they are, the trade of 'Iraq will inevitably suffer a tremendous setback. During the last forty days only, forty thousand bags and packages of sugar (soft and loaf) including tea entered the Port of Kuwait, while not even one tenth of thisthis amount entered the Port of Basra* The business or carrying these commodities from Kuwait {to be smuggled into ^raqj is brisk, and the merchants of Kuwait are enjoying wealth and luxury 9 while the merchants of ^raq are on the contrary suffering and watching this business with any eye of despondency and despair # The 'Iraq G-overnment inay allege that customs are their only source of revenue in 'Iraq, and that any reduc tion in same might bring bankruptcy on the G-overnment t They never think of the great gifts which they bestow in abundance on the nomads spread all over the desert, and of the innocent souls exposed to death at any moment, though it is well know^that casualties on both sides are 'Iraqis , Smugglers of necessity are driven towards danger and death by the natural desire of acquiring the large profits that ac crue from the trade. On the other hand were the 'Iraq Government to reduce her customs tariffs, imports would increase, the trade of 'Iraq Y/ould revive, well-being and prosperity would cane to most of the merchants of 'Iraq, and the lives of many 'Iraqis would be spared. Another suggestion is that the 'Iraq Government should open negotiations with the Shaikh of Kuwait for the conclusion of a treaty in which the latter should undertake to block up all smuggling activities. This she can achieve at a little cost, but it will enable her to root out this menacing traffic, and its advantages will be far greater than the price paid. The British G-overnment, if they wished, could easily persuade the Shaikh of Kuwait, who is in their hands and dare not contradict them, of the truth of this suggestion. Practice has proved that the Shaikh of Kuwait is not endowed with sufficient power to resist the projects of the British Grovemment. It will be more so in the case of 'Iraq Customs which are in their tight grasp, and whichand which are controlled by British adviaers; for the Director of Custom at Basra, and probably at the capital alS0 1IlfllCts ^d penalties according to his wish and whim. The merchants of Basra have lodged many/ccmplaint Protesting against his misuse of anthority. to several suc cessive cabinets, yet he remains unshaken in power, perhaps he will claim more than this. ^ If our ally, the British Government, will support our real demands, which can be summarized in the words to 'Iraq', Kuwait will ^ great _ 17 improve. How it is lagging behind in every phase of its life, ihere is no culture, no learning of any sort, no liber -ty etc., etc., in the principality, should Kuwait be annexed to 'Iraq, the accruing fruit will be great, especial ly in demolishing the ignorance and illiteracy prevailing there. Why, well to do persons in Kuwait actually send their children to tte schools of -Iraq today. This indeed implies that Kuwait is m dire need of culture and learning. Iraqis do not desire to benefit economically at the || pense o. Kuwait. On the contrary merchants of Kuwait will be able to buy landed properties in -Iraq, and thus invest their monies in its markets without the need of obtaining ' permits as they do now. We are ccnfident that the most educated people of they be soon brought into effect. We do not think that there is anything to hinder such union, as the population of both tries are ^rabs and Mohammedans; we except the question of Shaikhdom, which in our opinion, is the only obstacle in the way of this union. With the good will of both sides it will not be difficult to find out a solution for same.^Srtract fro??' an Article which appeared in the M A1 Alcha al Watni H newspaper of Bagdad, Ho.653, dated the 11th ^ehr^ ry 1934.

My dear George, You sent us under your printed letter of 28th Decenit)er, No. E.7589/7589/91, copy of a despatch from Baghdad on the subject of an Iraqi enquiry as to the date of institution of Koweiti and Bahreini nationality. I am afraid that owing to pressure of more urgent questions disposal of this has heen delayed and that even now we are not in a position to give very much assistance. 2. Humphrys suggests in his despatch that the inhabitants of hoth Koweit and Bahrein, for reasons which he gives, remained technically Ottoman subjects until the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne and that on this basis the date of creation of both Bahreini and Koweiti nationality is the date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. I doubt, however, if the position is, in fact, quite so simple. It is quite true that in the case of Bahrein/ .w. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G,, Foreign Office, cs w. iRshreln tiie Ottoman Government withdrew their claim to suzerainty in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913. But we had never recognised this claim, any more than we have recognised Persian claims, and we should, I liaaglne, loe Justified in maintaining (and it would Indeed 138 desirable to maintain) that we had consistently dealt with Bahrein as an independent State, possibly from so remote a date as our Treaty of 1820. on that assumption the importance of the Convention of 1913 would be merely that it represented a formal abandonment by Turkey of claims to which we had never assented - an abandonment similar to that which we hope to secure from Persia in the proposed General Treaty with her. 4. Koweit is more difficult. We gave the sheikh of Kowelt an undertaking on the 3rd November 1914 that Koweit would be recognised as 'an independont principality' under British protection. Humphrys is, I think, probably technically correct in maintaining that the date of the creation of a Koweltl nationality consequent on this assurance is the,date on which the Treaty of Lausanne came into force. On the other hand, as you know, we have teen anxious to give as little prominence as possible to the/. ■ ■ ■- 3 - 0 vp tiie position of Koweit as a portion of the former Turkish Empire in the interests of avoiding any effort, e.g. by the United. States Government, to claim that they had Inherited capitulatory rights in Koweit (you will remember that this specific point has heen very present to us in connection with the revision of the Koweit Order in council), and if on any ground it was possible to antedate the creation of Koweiti nationality to, e.g. our assurance of 1914 there would, I think, fee much on general grounds to he said for this. 5, The ahove represent our provisional views. But the points involved seem to me to he much more matters for expert legal advice in the Foreign Office than for the India Office. At the same time we are, of course, closely interested in the question of the reply to he given, and I venture to suggest that you might care to consider it further in the Foreign Office and give us an opportunity of commenting before any Instructions actually issue to Baghdad.

Telegrams (a) and (b) above were received by me aftei despatch of my telegram Bo.Bil of 6th April to Monsieur As far, French Consular Agent , Basra. So I think I had a right to presume that my informing him that there Y/as no accommodation available in Kuwait for the visitors would have been taken due notice of. 4. Telegram (c) arrived an hour before the party2 ^4° party readied Kuwait. u- ir^ o. j or your farther inforraation^/T to say ttiat on receipt of Monsieur Asfar's letter of 3rd April (on 6th April) and as soon as I had sent off my reply on 6th , I called on the Shaikh 'who was camped 7 miles away with his family and informed him of the situation. He expressed his most profuse gratitude at the action I had taken, saying that he could not possibly have entertained any members of the party as his Palace in Kuwait was closed. 6. It therefore came as an unpleasant shock to lis Excellency when I had to inform him by hurried priTate note on the morning of the 8th that the party was arriving inspite of my telegraii: putting than off, l.ot only did he express considerable annoyance to me when he saw me later in the day, but he asked how it was that I, his political Agent, appeared unable to stop Europeans from coming down, who were not wanted by him or me. 7, While I have .Iven you the above details of vfoat happened, the point I wish to bring out most of all is the unfortunate way this visit has been arranged. Clearly it was fixed up on the spur of the moment, and neither the Shaikh convenience nor mine was in the slightest degree considered, 8, A still more important point to my mind is the fact that you, the Political Heal dent in the Jersian Gulf aM my Chief, were neither informed nor consulted, which in the case of distinguished personages like the QPerman Minister and French Charge T d*affaires in 'Iraq, appears to me to be strangely lacking in courtesy, 9, The Jhaikh also noticed this omission, and aptly, I think, remarked that it was rather curious that proper steps had not been taken, as in the case of the American Ministeri to acquaint him of the coming arrival in his Capital, of important foreigners of ministerial rank.5 - 74 ( 10• As things turned out, the party which'arrived, sisted of (a) Dr, J-robba (and wife), German Minister; (b) Monsieur Lepissier (and wife) French Charge * d 1 Affaires; (c) Dr. erroann ouedhof, German ^dmcati onal -Expert attached to T Iraq G-ovemment r (d) Monsieur Asfar, French Consular Agent, Basra: and I did my best to entertain them and show them round the Tom personally, although I could offer them no food, as I had another large luncheon party on, consisting of Captain and H Llrs.Iiowes, American Kissionaries and Imperial Airways Officers (latter stranded here). II. The party neither called on,nor left cards for, the Shaikh, and left again for Basra at 2 P»LI», Monsieur Asfar before leaving apologized privately fcr the invasion, which he had done his best to stop on receipt of my Y /ire. IE. ./hi 1st in my house, Dr.Gro'ba and the French Charge 1 d 1 Affaires put one or two very pointed questions regarding the activities of the new Kuwait Oil Company, and appeared to be perfectly aware of who . Major Eolmes and Mr .Chisholm were. They also asked whether it was true that the Political Resident was about to take up his residence at Bahrain. 13. In my opinion the visit had some connection with Oil and was' in the nature of a 'preliminary look round'.

To my surprise, I found that in line 9 . the western boundary of the Kuwait heutral Zone is described as ft a low mountainous rid^e called ohaq (^sh lihakk)' . 3• This is an entirely erroneous description of this interesting natural feature and unless corrected now, may give rise to « h endless trouble later when Oil or other boundary questions come up for discussion or settlement. 4. In actual fact what is described as ' f a lo\y raouritaiiioi ; Ga11 t)y no stretch of the Imagination be considered a ridge or rise in the ground at all, seeing that it is a wide shallpyr d3;:}ression or valley .. varying in width from 1 mile to 6 miles, according to its position. 5, The depression in question, if the 1-1,000,000 Sheet Map, referred to in the Convention is examined, is obviously not a ridge or rar^ge of hills, and I can only think that the mistake arose owing to the fact that Colonel More, D.S»0., the then Political Agent, Kuwait who was present at the Ojair Conference of December 192 2 and signed the agreement on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait on 2nd December (the Shaikh signed at&lt;1^ i signed at a later date in Kuwait) was unfamiliar with the geography of the l.eutral Zone and the Tt Shaq n depression. 6. I personally have, on at least twenty occasions, travelled over the whole length of the 'Shaq' valley, and am also entirely familiar with the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and that portion oi baudi Arabia territory lying immediately to the ''est and. South of same. I therefore speak with authority, Ydaen j . say that the feature is a depression and not a ridge. V. As understood by the dhaildi of Kuwait, and I belive by Bin Saud also, the Western boundary of the Neutral Zone, io II ows an imaginary line drawn down the centre of the bhaq I3 X'3 3&gt;;ixi, this inspite of anything said in the con vention. 8, lb may further interest His Majesty's Gl-ovemment to know that Captain Papworth, H.E., in making his recent and very accurate survey of Kuwait and the Neutral Zone, placed the centre line of this Shaq depression at its lower end some 3 miles further to the West than is indicated on the million sheet. 9. In« submitting this report, I would suggest that tbe geographical error referred to be corrected in all 1929 and 1933 copies of 'Aitchison* s Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sanads' without delay.
