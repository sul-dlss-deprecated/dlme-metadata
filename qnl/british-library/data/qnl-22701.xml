I am consulting also Starling and Jarrett, to whom a copy of this letter and enclosures is being sent. Yours sincerely ? (Sgd.) R. PEELBahrein Unallotted Area . Mr. Ballantyne &lt;, at his request j called on the 26th June lor a further talk about the political agreement, etc. It v/as explained to him that in the absence of the views of certain other Departments concerned the draft agreement given to him v/as still purely provisional, He suggested however that time might oe saved if at this stage he could express his views iniormally. He wished to speak about three matters relating to the new concession. •A* The area of the concession . Mr. Ballantyne said his Company were specially interested m the cuestion of rights over the shallow waters round Bahrein. He was aware of the dispute as to the ownership of the two small islands west of Bahrein (Bain-al-Kabjr and Bain-as-Jaghir) and of the suggestion for dividing the Bahreini and Saudi spheres by a median line. He produced a large chart of the Bahrein archipelago which his Company were in process of completing by their surveys, a.nd pointing to various small islands east of Bahrein on which the Bahrein Government had put up marks he said that in one view Bahrein had sovereignty over the waters within three miles ox each of those islands. Further, if elsewhere in the shallow waters his Company were to erect derricks then he believed Bahrein could claim the ownership of the adjoining water's within a three mile radius. He however intended to put forward a more sweeping view, namely, that the whole of the area between Qatar and Hasa outside the territorial waters of Qatar and Saudi Arabia (in the latter case, east of a median line if one were drawn between Bahrein and the mainland) should be regarded as within che ownership of Bahrein (and so within the area of the Company's concession), on the analogy of claims which he believed were maintained elsewhere that territorial sovereignty could be exercised over all the waters of a gulf even/even outside the customary three-mile limit. I said that we should have to consult the Foreign Office before we could say whether it is possible to pursue this suggestion. B. The Concesni on agreemen t* Mr. Ballantyne left with me a copy (attached herewith) of the draft concession as it stood after negotiation with the Sheikh, together with certain correspondence relating thereto. He explained that the last two clauses were additions proposed subsequently to the submission of the draft to the Sheikh. He pointed out that as the result of discussion with the political authorities in Bahrein Article 2 had been modified in a way that he hoped would meet our objections to his original draft. He also drew attention to the specific reference in Article 4 to radio facilities, the use of which is confined within the limits of the concession. He said these facilities, to which he assumed His Majesty's Government would see no objection, were absolutely essential for the geophysical work which the Company would carry out in the additional area. He added that the Company's representative in Bahrein had tried to have included permission for the use of aircraft, but that the Political Agent and the Bahrein Government had firmly objected to this. C. The Political Agreement . Mr. Ballantyne left the attached memorandum as an informal expression of his comments on the draft. Apart from articles 3 and 10 (with the schedule) to which he saw fundamental objections, he referred to the following Articles Art. 2 . He suggested that instead of ' The recognised channel'' the words should be altered to ,! a recognised channel' so as not to preclude the Company from dealings with the Political Agent as the local representative of His Majesty's Government. Art. 7. Mr. Ballantyne was assured that this Article was in a common form as used in other/other similar agreements and did not arise out of any previous aspect of the company's relations with the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government; indeed its olgect might he expressed as a desire that the Company should continue in the future to act towards the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government as they had done in the past. When it was emphasised that the ¥/hole Article was expressly subject to the terms of the Company's concessions, Mr. Ballantyne did not seem anxious to press his objection. As regards Article 3} Mr. Ballantyne's difficulty lay in the words 'the obligations and benefits of those agreements.' If they covered^ not merely the formal assignment of the concession to another company, but also any alteration in the existing holdings of the Company's shares (or of the shares of The Standard Oil Co. of California) , this was an obligation that the Company could not accept. He said that over two years ago this issue had been discussed with us at the time when the Company was making marketing arrangements with the Texas Corporation, and that it had been found impossible to go beyond an understanding that the Company would give His Majesty's Government an opportunity to express their views before concluding transactions affecting their share holdings. The Company might have to enter into commitments, e.g. by mortgaging shares or operations for the funding of its obligations;, a possible result of which might be the passing of shares to interests which were neither British nor American, but the Company could not bind itself in all such cases to obtain beforehand the v/ritten consent of His Majesty's Government. As/4. As regards Article 10 and the schedule- Mr. Ballantyne, with reference to his note on this Article;, explained that the serious difficulty which he found in the pre-emption obligations had not so far occurred to his Company hut was inescapable, and would equally arise in connexion with mining concessions obtained hj^ Indian Oil Concessions in India. He was not aware that any such obligations had 'been entered into hy the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. or in respect of oil concessions in Iraq.. I said that the reason no doubt was that Persian and Iraq, territory not under our control? but that pre-emption obligations in the same terms had been accepted by the companies operating in the other Arab States of the Gulf, and that similar obligations were imposed by the Government of India. He said his Company had no desire whatever to avoid meeting His Majesty's Government's requirements. There would be no difficulty in their recognising that His Majesty's Government or the Sheikh on His Majesty's Government's advice could step in and take the oil when required in an emergency? this would be a case of the application of 'force majeure' beyond the Company's control? a contingency for which contracts duly make provision. But if the Company voluntarily accepted pre-emption obligations they would have to disclose them in their contracts and this would completely upset their marketing arrangements. He would be glad to discuss the difficulties with legal experts. I said that we would first have to diacusrs the Departments concerned who probably knew the answer to his objection. (Intld.)

NOTES Oil ROUGH DRAFT SUBMITTED BY H.M. GOYERHMEITT TO THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMRANY LIMITED FOR CONSIDERATION. 1. Delete present Recitals and substitute following- s- u The Company having knowledge of the protection afforded 'by H.M. Government to and enjoyed 'by, the Sheikh of Bahrain (hereinafter called 'the Sheikh' 1 ) and having hy the several Agreements dated the 29th December 1934, the 3rd June 1936 and the 1939^ obtained with the prior approval of H .M. Government the several concessions men tioned in such Agreements in regard to petroleum and matters relating to petroleum over the whole of the present and future territories of the Sheikh and having every desire to submit to the influence of H.M. Government within the confines of such territories^ has agreed with H.M. Government s as follows :- u 2. Delete present Clause 1. 3. Modify original Clause 2 to accord with the practice of the Company communicating with H.M,Government at Home and Abroad (abroad through the Political Agent and other Representatives) and thus avoid a technical default by failing to communicate through a British Subject in charge of the office in Great Britain. 4. Original Clause 3, The import of this is not understood; could it be explained ? 5. Original Clause 4. No objection. 6. Original Clause 5. It is suggested that this might be improved by altering it to read as follows 11 The Company in all except unimportant or routine matters shall deal with the Bahrain Government through a Chief Local Representative in Bahrain who shall be a British Subject and who shall be the recognised channel2. of communication 'between the Company and the Bahrain Government. All communications which that Official may desire on 'behalf of the Company to address to the Bahrain Government concerning amendments to or interpretations of, 'Che Mining Lease or to any supplements thereof or concerning any other matters of direct concern to H.M. Government, as indicated 'by H.B.M's Political Agent, shall he made through H.B.M's Political Agent in Bahrain. Communications with the Bahrain Government relating only to the conduct or regulation of ordinary company operations may he directly 'between the Chief Local Representative and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government; with copies to the Political Agent. The approval of H.M. Government shall be required for the person so designated. A reasonable time shall he allowed for the replacement of the Chief Local Representative in the event of the post falling vacant.'' 7. Original Clause 6 requires no comment. 8. Original Clause 7. The real import of this clause is understood to mean that the Company acknowledges the power and position of H.M. Government as the Protector of Bahrain. However, tied in as it is with the power of the Sheikh to terminate the concessions, it would seem to place into the hands of H.M. Government an undue legal power which the Company believes it is not the intention of H.M. Government to acquire. The Company wishes to uphold the position of the Government in Bahrain and assuming that H.M. Government desire to retain the Clause, it is suggested it should be altered to express the undertaking of the Company at all times to pay all proper deference due to the prestige of the Sheikh and to the advice of the Political Agent and the Political Resident in the PersianGulf subject always, of course? to the terms of its agreements with the Sheikh. Has this provision grown out of any contrary Listory during the past few years ? 9. Original Clause 8, It is assumed alternative accommodation available elsewhere is within the Sheikh's domain. 10. Original Clause 9 seems to he acceptable. 11. Original Clause 10. This, with its schedule, seems to overlook the fundamental difficulty with which an operating company is faced in providing for such provision in its marketing contracts. Whilst the terms themselves could be criticised any such criticism must be deferred to the all- important question of whether such terras can properly be imposed upon an operating company having regard to the fact that no buyer from the Company could possibly be asked to submit to a clause in his contract providing for the variation of the terms or termination of the contract to meet an agreed-upon supply of oil and/or loss of control upon the happening of a state of emergency proclaimed as such by H.M. Government. As to the arbitration, who would receive notice to arbitration as representing H.M. Government ?Comments on Mr. Ballantj^ne's notes on the Political Agreement. 1. Presumably this suggestion is in substitution for the 'whereas' paragraph of our preamble, which, along with our Article 1, was worded to cover the possibility that the political agreement would he signed before the concession. Mr. Ballantyne's draft seems unobjectionable except for the words 'prior approval' which in one sense are not accurate since approval of the new concession is conditional on the signing of the political agreement. Perhaps 'knowledge' would do in place of 'prior approval'? 2. Agreed. 3. The substitution of s, a' for 'the' before 'recognised channel' suggests that there may be several recognised channels, but there seems no practical objection to the change and the Company are not likely to want to alter their existing contacts with His Majesty's Government which work satisfactorily. 4. The Article in our draft was taken from the Koweit Political Agreement. In other political agreements 'obligations and benefits' is omitted. Mr. Ballantyne thinks there could be no objection to the Article with the words 'the obligations and benefits of' omitted; indeed the Article would then only reproduce in other terms the provisions of Article XIII of the 1934 lease (with reference to which, by the way, he would like to have inserted in the Political Agreement 'Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld' though we had already shown our unwillingness to add these words to Article 2.) But he suggests that this does not carry us as faras v/e might v/ishp since it does not provide control over share transactions 3 and that we might wish to have some such provision as i! lt is understood by the Company that any transactions which have as their object or possible result the passing of control over the Company's operations to foreign or ochor American interests shall not be effected without prior ascertainment of the views of His Majesty's Government 1 '. These are not Mr. Ballantyne's words and represent only a rough draft to show the nature of his suggestion, (Reference should be made in this connexion to India Office letter P.Z,2544/37 of the 20th April 19375 covering Mr. Clausen's note of an interview with Mr. Ballantyne on the 14th April, 1937 P and to Admiralty letter I of the 25th May 1937 ? Ho. M,02525/57. The subject seems to have been pursued no further in 1937 as no subsequent papers can be traced here). ^* Prima .jfacle and subject to the views of the local auuhonties this substitute for Article 5 seems unobjectionable. 8. The Article 7 of our draft is stock form in our drafts and we should perhaps insist on it. 9. The 'words ''within the Sheikh's territories' might be added after 'elsewhere' at the end of both sentences of Article 8. 11. This is for separate consideration.goftfide^Ual, EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL). GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department. [ . .

V Many thanks for your letter P.Z.4023/39 the 6th July, regarding the draft concession for the Bahrein Unallotted Area and the relevant draft political agreement. 2. I do not think v/e have any comments to make on one new draft concession. As regards the political agreement, v/e accept the views expressed ih your comments on Mr. Ballantj/ne's notes. I personally do not feel that the point aoout the pre-emption clause is of outstanding importance. As the Company themselves seem to recognise, v/e should, in the event of an emergency, presumably do whatever we thought necessary, and ( the Company, whatever its nationality, woulc have to accept our action as for ce majeure . As regards Mr. Ballantyne's suggestion aDout the area of the concession, we feel that he is prohahly confusing (1) the question of the extent of territorial waters with (2) the question of the acquisition of rights over the sea-hed outside territorial waters. 4. Mr. Ballant;/ne is quite right in saying that the Sheikh of Bahrein has sovereignty over all waters within 3 nautical miles from low-water mark of any islands over which he can properly claim sovereignty, unless, of course, land 'belonging to any other Power lies within 6 miles of a Bahrein island, in which case the boundary of territorial waters should divide the distance equally. 5* We do not, however, think that the further proposition could he sustained that, if the Company were to erect derricks in shallow waters, these derricks would each constitute a new island, so to speak, from which a new area/area of 3 miles could 'bo claimed as Bahrein territorial waters. Such claims have heen put forward unsuccessfully in the post for light-houses and anchored light-ships. 6. Nor can we accept Mr. Ballantyne's further contention that the whole of .the area of the gulf outside the territorial waters of Qatar and Saudi Arabia could he claimed for Bahrein. This gulf is not hounded hy the territory of a single State and the special rule ahout landlocked hays surrounded hy the territories of a single State would not therefore apply here even if the gulf were indeed such a hay which seems doubtful. 7. The position with regard to the acquisition of rights over the sea-hed was? as you will rememher? set ouc in Beckett's minute of the 22nd April 1938, a copy of whicn was sent to Gibson under cover of Brenan's letter E2288/413/91 of the 25th April. It is recognised hy His Majesty's Government that the 'bed of the sea and the land under it is capable of acquisition hy occupation beyond the 3-mile limit. The Company would therefore he able to appropriate the sea-hed outside territorial waters Dy effective occupation, and, as and when they did so, the sovereignty would presumably vest in the Sheikh of Bahrein though it might he advisable for the Bahrein Government to / make some further overt act claiming such sovereignty. I am sending copies of this letter to Jarrett and Starling- Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay. »T-Peel&gt; Esq 0 , G.B.Eo, M»C.IMMEDIATE. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, D epartment.

From our own point of view there is much advantage in expediting the explor ation of possible oil-bearing areas to reinforce the existing Bahrain field since my information is that experimental production over a daily average of SO,000 barrels is resulting in an alarming influx of water. 3m Would it now be possible to accelerate the final settlement of concessional terms and of the political agreement ? There can be no doubt of the political advantage of a rapid settlement now. So far/ s. e. m p -400s&amp;p (m 480 26 7-34 2. 0, j00.2 i ar as I am aware no objections have been raised by any Dspartment of His Majesty 's Government to the terms of the lease, and the only serious obstacle to a final settlement is the question of the pre-emption schedule in the political agreement. I venture to suggest that this need cause no delay. The Bahrain, London and Sew York offices of the Company all recognise clearly that the British Government can and will take any action they choose in respect of Bahrain crude and Refinery output. Legally no difficulties exist, Bahrain, it has been held, is legally at war (by virtue of its Treaties) in any war in which Great Britain is involved* The Bahrain Petroleum Company, whatever the nationality of its Parent Companys, is a registered British Company. Under the terms of the Persian Gull states Emergency Order in Council any of the Defence Regulations 1339 applicable in Great Britain can equally be applied in Bahrain, and a local Regulation based on (Great Britain) Regulation 55 provides all powers necessary. The operation of such powers provides the Comp-t- ny with the cover for their 'force majeure 1 * clauses in sales contracts. 4* In such circumstances it would seem possible to side track any question of a pre-emption agreement and to assuj^e the maximum political benefit (in our relations not only with the Shaikh of Bahrain but also with the Company) derivable fro® an imnediate settlement. Such accion 'would equally assure our control of Saudi crude oil once it has been imported into Bahrain for refining, since this oil is -purchased by the Bahrain Company from the California Arabia Standard Oil Company, and is therefore, in Bahrain, subject to the operation of a Defence ■Regulation.

We have investigated and know almost certainly that there is no Eocene exposed in the additional area except on the main island and perhaps on Hawar and obviously the Miocene on surrounding islands and shoals is unconformable. A top of Eocene map of the main island is being prepared from water well logs. It is evident that it will be necess ary to depend on geophysical work and structure drilling to locate possible structures in the additional area. OEOPHYSICAL . The outbreak of the war has delayed the geophysical work somewhat# Special marine seismo rephs, a new recorder, and 10,000 feet of special drill pipe were on the s.s. w R JCH ':l- F whose present whereabouts is unknown. Our 3.- .1. party was stranded in Prance for some time but arrived here safely on September 18th. Most of this crew have had water experienca. The drilling barge, a 30* x 80* flat wooden barge, has been completely rigged up with 8-5/8*' drill pipe spud® at each corner. Ten holes were drilled to depths about 60 1 near the Sitra pier to test the rig and develop suitable fish-tail bits. The barge was put to work on Septexiher S3rd drilling a line of 70--foot shot holes at 5,000 feet intervals daa north from the Portuguese fort. The operation of the drilling barge has been entirely successful even in strong currents. The instruments have been rigged up in the recording boat and some shots were made today at Sitra tc test the instruaents and to learn bow many fish may be killed. Results were satisfactory and all equipment and boats will be moved from Sitra and put on the line tomorrow. Bapoo oil barge Ho,8 was fitted out as a houseboat for the geophysical crew with the approval of Slew York but on September 24th, Just on the day we intended to put her in use, we received advice from London to prepare to resume barge movements between Zelaq and AX Khobar, are trying to find an oil barge in Basra or Abadan to replace No.S because if we have to rig up small freight barges as house boats the expense and delay will cost us at least f- 10,000* Structures on bargs Ko.2 include a rougb frame bunkhouse, office, and messhall.

The negotiations between His Highness f s Government and the Company were completed about six months ago and since then His Highness has given permission to the Company to make certain examinations of the sea bed in the waters around Bahrain. His Highness has also permitted the Company's geologists to visit various islands within the additional area. 3. His Highness understands that the delay is not due to any of the conditions in the agreement between himself and the Company but is owing to matters which are being dealt with between the British Govern ment and the Company. His Highness wishes me to enquire whether it could be suggested that the Company should pay the Rs 400,000/- which is due on signing the agreement with the condition that should the agreement not be signed the money would be refunded by the Bahrainr—-2- Bahrain Government to the Company. * 4. His Highness is somewhat reluctant to mention that when he presented the sum of £30,000. to the British Government he had assumed that the payment of four lakhs would be made shortly. This and the cost of reserve food supplies for Bahrain has so reduced the Government's funds that it has not been possible to increase the Reserve Fund during the second half of the year. If the company could pay the four lakhs now, it would be greatly appreciated by His Highness Shaikh Hamad.

I do not consider the request made in this letter at all suitable for a State in the position of Bahrain which, even if its investments for a Reserve Fund are delayed, is far from being in such a condition of penury that it urgently requires the sum of 4 lakhs due on signing the agreement for the Unallotted Area. On the other hand it is only too easy to appreciate the sentiments implicit in the sentence : 'His Highness understands that the delay is not due to any of the conditions in the agreement between himself and the Con?)any but is owing to matters that are being dealt with between the British Government and the Company.' 3, Although there is not the least doubt that I could obtain the ready consent of the Company to pay over the sum of Rs. 4 lakhs under the conditions stated in the Adviser's letter, I consider it highly /- S. mpp—367 s&amp;p- (m-sos)—15-7.35—10,000.

I would suggest that for the reasons stated in my Express letter Ho. C/53g dated the 10th September 1939 the question of the Political Agree ment raises no serious problem; and I recommend once . more that His Majesty*s Government be invited to com- f municate their final decision with the least possible delay. v, ^ 4, I need only add that the relationship between the sum of £30,000 presented by His Highness to the British Government for war purposes and the lump sum payment of Bs 4 lakhs due on the signature of the con cession is sufficiently apparent. .

Gierhart has completed a reconnaissance of Hawar Island and submitted his report. He elso has completed a surrey of Bahrein for the purpose of deter- ainin the availability of limestone and sand suitable for Portland cement manufacture, and has prepared a report of his findings. Also, on the basis of available data, Mr. Oierhart has prepared a preliminary contour map of Bahrein Island based on the top of Eocene. His work discloses that several points of value are missin- and will have to be obtained thru structure drilling. Samples obteined froas water wells recently drilled on Unm Hasan and Jidda Islands are stored at Dhahran but have not been studied. e now have obtained samples on a structure hole drilled on Umm c aban Island and are in the process of collecting samples from a structure hole being drilled on the extreme south •nd of Bahrein at Ras al Baar. Reliable determinations of the top of the Eocene at these locations, should form an important suppleaent to the structural data already accu olated. 1 e had planned to obtain Mr. Bramkamp's determinations on such samples from structure holes and water wells as are available; but the rush of work on the mainland has not penr-itted Mr. Bramkamp to come to the island for these studies. ie have been sending samples to Dhahran for his examination and he has replied as promptly as possible; but the general system is not entirely satisfystory. r. Kerr has discussed ohsngas with cConnell, with a vie« to improving the geological service. After investigation and final review of all the samples that will be available following the completion of the structure hole at Has al Baar, we will consider the advisability of drilling additional structure holes. ! QEOPHYHlCAL t As the last report was written Just prior to the oommencerBent of the actual geophysical exploration, this report covers all of the operations to date. As mentioned in the last progress report on September £6th, the drilling of holes in which the dynamite cbsrges later would be placed, was started just north of the ortu *aeae 'ort on the extreme north end of Bahrein Island. Drilling was performed by equipment installed on the drilling barge and dis cussed in previous progress reports. The first holes were drilled to a depth of 70* from water level, in water that was not wore than 20* deep at the time of drilling. Later, the drilling depth as reduced to between 50* end 60* below water level.| kttmv th® drilling barge had moved to aflvancad locations, the recording boats and equipment of the aeia®ograph party »ere placed in operation, and the seiBROgraph records obtained. Shot holes were placed and readinga obtained at approximately SOW* intervals extending along lines agreed upon with the Bahrein Government• To date, records have been obtained along lines Hos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. At present, drilling is nearly completed on line Wo.7, and the seiswo- graph party should finish shooting this line within the next weefe, weather permitting. a next plan to wove to line No.13, extending south-east from Bahrein in the direction of Sohat al Useiwid, to pass in the vicinity of shoal Thaiib. , A' J ' fhe last progress report spoke of experiaental shooting to determine whether many fish would be killed by this action. e have found that fish are killed only occasionally and not in large numbers. The charges of explosive US4M1 are relatively anall and apparently result in very little, if any, damage. During early drilling operations, the waather was relatively calm and drilling proceeded with no serious difficulty. However, it was found from the start that because of the extrasrely herd formations to be penetrated, the rate of drilling was much slower than in other seismograph operations conducted in water. The formations drilled have been predominantly hard limestone with a few streaks of shale and sand. Obviously, the rate of progress was much slower than in areas such as Galveston Bays where formations were predominantly mud and clay, and where boles were washed down rather than drilled. As a result, an average of only Is holes have been drilled per 8 hour tour. The hard formatione also have increased the difficulty of holding the barge in position against the action of waves and tide. The original spuds holding the drilling barge, if dropped on hard surface, tended to shift and slip, resulting in the bending of the drill stem if drilling was in progress at the time. Also, as drilling in the hard formations with the present method has reiuired semi-rigid attachment of the drill pipe thru the drilling equipment to kthe barge, any wave action that moves the barge up and down, alternately lifts the bit off bottom and then throws it back, with a considerable portion of the bar o*s weight upon it. Accordingly, drilling has to be suspended in much taimer water than if formations were soft and the drill pipe were heavy enough to drill with only its own weight. .Additional drilling difficulties arose with the bending of one of the 8 -5/8** spuds which holds the barge In position during drilling. This beading probably was due to the hard bottom, which occasionally permitted certain of the spuds to slip, thereby throwing excessive weight on those remaining in place. hen the spud under discussion was bent, it could not be lifted thru the close fitting guide that held It in position and was bolted to the side ©f the barge. Fortunately, the barge could be and was, moved into deep water %here ti ^ julde could be removed. A readily detachable typ® of guide then was Installed but proved to be unsatisfactory due to the lack of e close fit on the spud and weak bracing to the barge. These defects were corrected and the spuds, previously reinforced internally, were filled with concrete to give weight and additional resistance to bonding. Also, two spare spuds were placed en the barge where they could be used as replacements without the necessity of bringing the barge into port for repair.These iroproverants have Son® much to Increase tha ability of the drilling equipment to operate In Moderately rough waatbar. However» tha equipment Is not capable of continuous operation under present weather conditions and those tfcat ©ay be anticipated during tha next few months. On the other hand, the taking of griisinograph records also Is handicapped by rough water; and at the present time, the drilling barge can perform In practically as rough weather as the recording boots, Until recently, the drilling barge was able to keep ahaad of these boats, but rough weather, hard formations, and the repairs described above, have re sulted in the recording work catching up with drilling. Accordingly, we have replaced the one drilling tour with two tours extending frosi dawn until after dark. The barge has bean moved only in daylight, but is equipped with lights which permit drilling to completion the hole at any location over which the barge has been spotted before dark. As the result of adopting the two tour schedule, the drillin barge now avers es three holes par day. The recording party also has encountered difficulties inherent to opera tions In new areas under new conditions. The high salinity of water, the hard bottom, and the strong tides and currents, all have presented problems that had to be solved by experlnentatlon and experience. Steady lisprovament in technique is bain- effected as the work progresses, review of these developments Involves highly taohnleal discussions beyond the scope of this report. During the past month (since the middle of Decsraber), rough weather has handicapped operations seriously. Since December l£th, the seismograph crew have been able to work only about 14 days. The stirm of last week not only prohibited ell drilling and shooting, but resulted In the temporary loss of the drilling barge, tha dynamite boat, and three small boats. The barge has been recovered undamaged, and the dynamite boat has been located on the latar Coast, its cargo undamaged, ' s understand the small boats also have been located in this vicinity, Negotiations now are under way for the return of dynsmite and 'the boats. While another stem of similar violence is not apt to occur this season, we are advised that we can expect not more than fifty percent operating weather until about the middle of March, and that this figure probably will increase to from then until about tha first of June. On December ESnd, Mr, Cunningham of the Standard Oil Company of California end Mr. Green of the Geophysical Survey Inc, t arrived in Bahrein. During the past month, they divided their time between Arabia and Bahrein, devoting a considerable portion to a study of the technique for obtaining satisfactory seismic records. Their visit has been most opportune and of great value to us, end has had an Important bearing on the character of the survey, Seophysical operations have been handicapped by the nature of the boats available. ' hlle these native vessels are satisfactory from the standpoint of seaworthiness, they are badly underpowered and accordingly can be manipulated slowly and with difficulty.4 / - 5 • fiarly In soember, I4r» Beverly left Bahrein for serrlce In Egypt. Less than two weks later, Mr, Heitb was taken 111 and forces to return to the United States, The loss of these two wen naturally has affected the operation of the project• On October 31, 1939, at the Government's request, we transferred all of the Cor-pany's supply of dynamite and a portion of the supply of 0.to Jidda Island for storage. The remainder the a,S,I, supply, was carried on the dynamite boat operating with the seismograph party, thereby removing all explosives connected with this operation from the Island of Bahrein.

As regards the Political Agreement :- ' I ' (a) We have £o comments on the draft as submitted in your letter of 30th May. We note that the Agreement is « intended to apply over the whole area covered by the » Comp any * s cone e s si on. &gt; v (b) We have no comments on Powle 1 s letter of 10th July (enclosed with India Office printed letter P.Z.4559/39 of 28th July) but it is interesting to note that Weightman has to some extent anticipated the Company's difficulties regarding pre-emption. (c) There is little on which the Petroleum Department need comment on Ballantyne's written observations on the Political .greement dated 26th June and in your Department* s note of provisional comments. We see (Gibson*s note of ^ 26th June) that Ballantyne is apparently not going to press his objection to Article 7 . On the question of pre-emption, see (ej below* . , y. ^ \ (d) As to Ballantyne's comments on Article 3 of the Political .greemsnt (see Gibson's note of 26th June;, we note that, as indicated in your note of provisional comments, the words 'obligations and benefits' in this draft article, to which Ballantyne particularly objects, were taken from the Koweit Political Agreement and do not appear for instance, |f in the Dcbai and oharjah Political Agreements, For our part we should agree to the deletion of these words, if this satisfies Ballantyne. But we do think that it would be desirable to insert something on the lines of the further sentence in your note of provisional comments (i.e. 'It is understood His Majesty's Government'). (e) As regards the difficult question of pre-emption ( Article 10 and &gt;chediile ) the particular point which the Company are making, namely, possible upsetting of their marketing arrangements following on disclosure of their „ pre-emption obligations, has certainly never been raised before. Ballantyne admits, however, that his Company's contracts duly make provision for 'force majeure'; the 'pre-emption clause' is really only designed to provide for the procedure and to afford a measure of price control in the event of a particular type of 'force majeure' being exercised. In these circumstances, it might perhaps meet Ballantyne's difficulty if the Company, instead of being asked to agree that His Majesty's Government shall have the right of pre-emption, are merely asked to agree that, in the event/ R.T.Peel, Esq. , C.B.E. , India Office, _ ^ , S.

S.w.l, 14th PeDPuary, 1940c y'\'V Dear Jarretit, % - /V f/ould you please refer to Admiralty letter of the 31st January 5 IT o.M. 064(^1/39 , ah out the Bahrein unallotted area agreements. You will also have seen Ravenshear's letter of A • llth Januarrfp.D.21/12/1) and Baggallay's letter of the .26th August'(E ^1/196/91) on the same suhject, 2. Tne correspondence shows that the Foreign Office and Petroleum Department do not attach the same importance as do the Admiralty to the retention of the pre-emption clause and schedule in the draft political agreement. Our feeling is that the Company's ohjection to the pre-emption provisions have some substance, and that it would he more satisfactory to avoid using the heavy hand with them if we can resort to a compromise which, while acceptable to them, will secure us all we want. We do not think that the hypothesis in the penultimate sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Admiralty can he accepted, as we are advised that if a pre-emption clo.Uoe is inserted in the political agreement the effect is th &amp; t anything done by virtue of the rights and obligations created thereunder cannot be attributed to 'force majeure'. We could therefore only take the line with the Company that the pre-emption provisions must be included just as they have been included in agreements with many other Companies. 3. We think however that, following the suggestion in paragraph 2 (e) of Ravenshear's letter, a satisfactory compromise is possible. We would propose, (a), to substitute V /U for / C.G,Jarrett, Esq. Admiralty, S.W.I.'V for the existing pre-emption provisions a clause and .schedule ; on the lines of the enclosed draft, and (To), to arrange hy an exchange of letters., as a condition of His Majesty's G-overnraeno 1 s approval of the concession, that the Sheikh gives an undertaking to carry out the wishes of His Majesty's Government if the latter, in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of either of which His Majesty's Government would he the sole judge) should advise him to take over on their 'behalf the Company's products and production arrangements. We think this course would fully secure the advantage referred to in the fourth paragraph of the Admiralty letter, while we have no reason to suppose it would oe unacceptable to the Company or to the Sheikh. The Company have raised no objection to His Majesty's Government acting oy 'force majeure' rather than by virtue of a •pre-emption agreement, and we are advised that, by agreeing to provisions as in the enclosed draft, they would not be prejudiced in pleading 'force majeure' in defence of a breach of contract. As for proposal (b), we do not anticipate any objection on the Sheikh's part, inasmuch as no more is asked of him in effect than if he were asked to take cognisance of a political agreement containing pre-emption provisions. 4. We hope that you will agree with the above suggestion and we should be grateful if you could let us know, as early as you possibly can, whether the Admiralty are willing to forgo in favour of it, the view taken in their official letter. In other respects we are now ready to communicate His Majesty's Government's views to the Company, and are anxious to avoid any further delay. * ■ 1 - 0 ending a copy 01 this letter to Eyres and to Ra/enshear, who will no doubt let us know if they see any objection to the terras of the enclosed draft.

As regards the first letter of the 30th May, covering a preliminary draft of the Company 's concession agreement. My «ords have now no remarks to offer either on the description of w , heikh'3 territory which has been accepted without comment by that Ruler, or on the compulsory processing of a minimum quantity of Bahrein oil which has since been agreed to and stands as Article 9 of the revised commercial Agreement. 2, as regards the second letter of the 30th iey dealing with the political agreenent between His Majesty's Government and the Company, which follows in its general lines the political agrcementr in other neighbouring territories, My ,,ord8 concur in the addition to clause 8 to provide for the use by Majesty's Government of harbours and harbour facilities developed by the Company, and as regards clause 5 (channels of communication between the Company end the Bahrein Government) are prepared to agree to any arrangements that meet local convenience and permit of adequete British control. They also concur in the proposal that Article 11 should provide only for ^ the termination of the concession agreement by the Jheikh for anj breach of the political agreement and should not provide for confiscation of property. 3. As regards the question the sea are® of the Bahrein State, ay Lords agree with the Foreign Office view that - (1) Sovereignty extends over all waters within three nautical miles from low water mark of % any of the Bahrein islands, unless land belonging to any other power lies within six miles, in which ease the boundary of territorial waters divides the distance equally. (£} company's derricks erected in shallow water would not constitute a new island from which a new area of three miles width could be claimed as territorial waters. ( 3) The area of the Gulf, outside the territorial waters of star and .iaudi Arabia cannot be claimed as Bahrein territorial raters. &gt; (4) The bed of th« sea and the land under it is however capable o acquisition by occupation beyond the three mile limit. Subject in (4) however, to the addition that such acquisition by occupation must not affect the use by all countries of the waters over such portions of the bed of the sea or the land under it.

We found after further discussion that the Conpany maintained their objections to the pre-emption provisions as originally proposed by us, and we therefore were obliged to offer them the compromise which you were prepared if necessary to accept. A copy of our lett&lt; Mr, Ballantyne is being sent to you separately. i 2. I discussed the agreements today with Mr. Ballantyne and Mr. Thornburg, one of the American directors, and find that, except for one point, they are prepared to accept our amendments of the commercial concession and also the draft of the political agreement now offered to them. The exception relates to the schedule to the political agreement. The Company are very anxious to ensure that they will not be kept waiting an unreasonable time for payment for oil etc. taken over by or on behalf of His Majesty's Government, Consequently they wish to insert, as a new sub-paragraph of paragraph 1(iv) of the schedule, the following - 'Unless otherwise agreed upon, payments shall be made to the Company at Bahrein within 30 C 01 '? if Hi® Majesty's Government press for it, within 60) days after delivery'. 3. It was obvious that the Company attached much importance to this stipulation of a period within which payment is to be made, and prima, facie it seems reasonable in principle. Would you kindly let us know as soon as possible whether you concur in the,amendment? 4. If you could give me some indication in the course of tomorrow (Wednesday) C. G. Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty, S.W. 1.(Wednesday) of how the Admiralty would regard the amendment I should be most grateful.

I have to Inform you, in reply, as follows:- (a) The draft of the Deed of Further Modification of the Lease dated 29th December 1934, as amended 'by you, is satisfactory to my Company. There are one or two verbal corrections to he made for engrossing purposes; these I have shewn in red ink on the draft accompanying your letter to me, and which draft is enclosed herewith. Would you he good enough to return this draft to me at your convenience. (h) To answer the question in suh-clause (iii) of clause of your letter, I would say that the provisions of Articles XII, XVIII, XIX and XXII of the 1934 Lease, will, hy virtue of the new Deed of Modification, he extended to the unallotted area. On the other hand, the political provisions in the present Lease remain in the Lease, although they will he superseded hy the new Political Agreement. These provisions can he left out of the comprehensive Concession which, as you rightly 'believe, the Company intend subsequently to negotiate to cover in one document all their rights in the Sheikh's territory. (c) The Company also instruct me to say that the form of the Political Agreement accompanying your letter under reply, is also one which they are pleased to he able to accept with the two slight exceptions which were mentioned to Mr. Gibson at the talk Mr. Max Thornhurg and I had with him this affcernoon. These/These exceptions are:- (i) The provision to 'be made for the payment for oil or oil products as they are delivered from time to time or within a specified period of delivery, and (ii) That the place of payment 'be Bahrain. I have modified in red ink, one of the drafts you kindly sent to me for my use ? and return it to you so that you may see the wording of the alterations we asked for. I may add that although it is considered to 'be important that the place of payment should he designated, if ufssihlej it is imperative that the provision as to payment should he made. Prom their experience in these matters, the Company see no reason why a fair price should not he readily ascertainable for oil and oil products taken over hy His Majesty's Government, and also why those prices should not he paid on or a short time after delivery. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R.Ballantyne. R.T.Peel Esq., C.B.E,, M.C., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I.P.Z.590/40. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 21st March, 1940. Dear Mr. Ballantyne, Y/e are at last in a position to communicate to you the views of riis Majesty's Government upon the agreements required to give effect to the decision of the Sheikh of tahrein to give to your Company a concession in respect of the Unallotted Area. We regret the delay, but I think you appreciate the difficulties which have hampered con sultation with the other Departments concerned. (A - . . 'W • With regara to the draft concessijxl agreement of which you left a copy here on the 26th^une, we have the following suggestions to make, subject to which no objectic is seen to the terms of the draft. (i) Article 4. It is clearly the intention (sub-article (c)) that the Company should not have a complete monopoly of marketing oil within the Sheikh's present and future dominions, but such a monopoly is apparently implicit in the exclusive right to transport (sub-article (a)). To remove the inconsistency it is suggested that the word 'transport' should be omitted from sub-article (a) and that the words 'or transport' should be inserted after 'Sell' in sub-article (c). Ar tiGle 9 . it is suggested that the words ''royalty paying' should be inserted before 'oil' in the phrase immediately preceding the proviso clause, i.e. 'shall be royalty paying oil produced in the Sheikh's present and future dominions'. The object is to make it clear thac the specified amount is a net figure, and is not subject/ Ballantyne, Esq.,r% 2. subject to any deduction resulting from the arrangement under which gas produced in the refining process and used in the furnaces is converted 'by an agreed formula into an equivalent amount of oil fuel and then deducted from the royalty paying total of crude oil as 'oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installations'. (iii) It is considered that provisions corresponding to Articles XII, mil, XIX and XXII of the 1934 lease should a PPly also to the Lnallotted Area. May presume that this will at any rate he effected in the comprehensive concession which I think the Company intend subsequently to negotiate to cover all their rights in the Sheikh's territory? (iv) It is considered desirable to include in the concession an article providing against the pollution of coastal waters by oil etc. I believe that this was mentioned to you orally last May or June and that you thought there would be no difficulty over it. m \ /' \ ' 3. To prevent any confusion I enclose a copy of the draft concession agreement as received from you'last June and containing, in words underlined, the suggestions made In the preceding paragraph. ? „«y V. .1 • i 4. I also enclose a drafts as amended in The light of discussion with you last June, of the political agreement between tne Company and His Majesty's Government. You will find that we have gone far to meet your suggestions, and I hope that you will be able to recommend the present draft for your Company's approval. The only explanation I think I need make is with reference to the pre-emption provisions of the former draft. We should have greatly preferred to xetain them, since they are in accordance with accepted practice elsewhere in the Arab States of the Gulf as well as in India, I understand, however, that you are unable to/to advise your Company to accept the provisions as they stood, and that heing so we are in the circumstances prepared to adopt the alternative proposed in clause 9 and the schedule enclosed draft, provided of course that the trilateral arrangement suggested is rounded off hy an agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh, who has not yet heen approached in this respect. J understand however that so far as you are concerned the arrangement is one which your Company is likely to he ahle to accept. Yours sincerely, Sgd. R. Peel.rPtt m P.Z.1684/40. M.03201/40. MILITARY BRANCH, ADMIRALTY', S.V/.l. m 20th March, 1940. CONFIDENT Dear Peel, In reply to your letter of the 14th February last P.Z.620/40, concerning the Bahrein unallotted area agreements, I write to say that we were very reluctant to abandon the pre-emption clause in its original xorra because an agreement of this nature direct with ohe company has, we think, considerable advantages over an agreement in which our power to take action is dependent on our relations with or an agreement by the Sheikh himself. ihe aosence of the pre-emption clause in the original Bahrein concession was a matter of considerable concern to the Admiralty, though at a later stage it was accepced that we should, in fact, in the case of Bahrein, where our grip is much tighter than with the other Sheikhs in this area, be able to act through the Sheikh to get what we wanted in time of war. 5 ■^• s a result, however, of this anxiety, great . ca - rewas taken to get the pre-emption clause inserted in the other concessions in the area. If we now make a new agreement without the simple pre-emption clause, this may be a precedent to otner agreements in areas where our status with the local Sheikh is not so firm. However, we understand that the effect of the agreement now proposed, coupled with the undertaking to oe given by the Sheikh, is to subject production under both the old concession and the new to a qualified R.T.Peel, Esq.,C.B.E., ^ / India Office, form/ S.W.I,form of pre-emption, and in consequence we should make a definite gain in respect of our position vis-a-vis the old concession. Assuming that this is a fact, we agree that the arrangement now suggested should he accepted if it is quite clear that the company will not accept the ordinary pre-emption clause. As regards the draft Schedule, it seems quite possible that EUM.Government might not require the Sheikh to take over the whole production, and this being so # it seems necessary to insert the words Ox any of the' in front of the words 'crude $11' and producW in the first and second lines of the Schedule, A copy Oi. this letter has 'been sent to Eyres and Ravenshear 0 Yours sincerely, (Sd.)O.G.J arrett»ai/ THIS DEED made between HIS HIGIMSSS SliAIKIi SIR BIN SHAIKH 'ISA AL KHALIFAH, K.C.I.E. ?

JT p / itflth ! ■&gt; I ''-' IA OFFICE, . WHITEHALL, S.W.l. P.Z. 1888/40. 8th April 1940. Urgent Dear Jarrettj You will have seen the recent telegraphic correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ahout the proposed political agreement with the Bahrein , Petroleum Company and in particular ahout the substitution of 'force majeure 1 ' provisions for the more orthodox pre-emption c t&gt; clauses. I enclose a further copy for ready reference. , V 2. It is undoubtedly the case, as Prior points-out, that jurisdiction over foreign Companies and foreign property in Bahrein is exercised 'by us, and not 'by the Sheikh; and although our draft agreement spoke of the Sheikh acting on the advice and on behalf of His Majesty's Government we think, on reconsideration, that it would be preferable as Prior suggests to omit the reference to the Sheikh in the draft Article 9 and the Schedule. Thus, the legal position being as pointed out in Prior's telegram, there can be no doubt that His Majesty's Government can legally take and exercise powers to commandeer the Company's products - or even, if necessary to take over their Installation ~ in an emergency, o ■ ■ 3« It is however still our intention that before the concession is approved by His Majesty's Government the Sheikh . U V should be required to take cognisance of the political agreement (as in Koweit and elsewhere), and to forestall any possible misapprehension on his part we propose to ask the political authorities to communicate the draft to the Sheikh before it is concluded here, and to explain to him the meaning of the 'requisitioning' clause and the reason for its substitution for pre-emption provisions. ♦ COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL C.G.Jarrett, Esq., Admiralty. —^ COPY SENT BY AIR ^AO. 4,2 ''/ill you kindly let me know as soon as possible wnether you agpee with, the foregoing# I am writing similarly to Eyres and Ravenshear# Yours sincerely, (SgcL) R.

The re-check waa performed along a line parallel and to the west of old tine ifo.l. Also, two extra holea were drilled ia the north-west portion of the Faaht to further cheek data obtained in thia general area. After the completion of thia work, on February 14th, the houseboat waa reaoved from aerrice in order to make the barge on which the house waa constructed available for transporting oil from Has Tenure to Zelalr. The houaeboat equipment wea diswantlad at the Sitra terminal and certain portiona left there awaiting the time when another barge will be put ia service.

With the loss of the houseboat, operations of aeeecaity were eoaceatreted ia the area iinmedlately north of Bahrein, the sals- nograph crew liviag in the Awali Oaap and bringing their boats into the Manama harbor et night. Because of the need for an unusual amount of work in the area between Bahrein and fasht al Jarin, the lade of the houseboat during the past two months has bean a small but not important handicap. In addition to the exploring along the north side of Muharrat Island, a general area was iaveati* gated coverlag a major portioa of the shallow water immediately north of Sahrein.

The boats suffered little daffies© and the dynamite cargo was resovered, with the exception of few sticks left in an opened case, la view of the hazard in^olwad by the presence of a large stock of dynamite carried with the seismograph party, the Bahrein Oowem- nent requested that a maximum of 1000# be kept on the dynamite boat. *s haartlly agreed with this request and have complied with it. Additional dynajwite supplies are stored on Jedda Island and are readily 8ys liable to the seismograph crew. On January 30th, a fire broke out on the launch 'SWBX**- which et thst time was being used to house the recording Instruments of the seismograph party, fast work on the part of the two staff men aboard, rasultsd in trans porting all the recording equipment to mother launch and alnking the -Syria In shallow water, in order to extinguish the firs. The fire was started from a kerosene burning pressure type cook store operated hy the native erew. As a result of thia accident, orders wore Issued that no fires of an/ nature ware to be built on the boats Imasdiately concerned with shooting and recording operations, and that other hired launches could carry fires only when staff men were not on board. The 'Syria** was salvaged with little difficulty, towed to Manama, repaired, » nd is now la service again as ths instrument boat. Shooting operations ?

In the course of an interview to-day His Highness raised this subject. He pointed out that he had sent in the draft of the proposed Agreement for the Additional Area no less than 11 months ago and that he believed that the delay was due solely to the protracted negotiations between His Mc .j- sty 's Government and the Company relating to their own agreement. It appeared to him that his Interests and the interests of Bahrain were being ignored. 3/- s. e. M P -4003&amp;P ,M 480 26 7-34 2 0,XX) Jv «• g -► \A (T®) 5. I undertook: to communicate Ris Highness comments by telegram but after leaving him I heard of the Mediterranean crisis and it seamed improper to use the cables at the present Juncture for a telegram on such a subject as this. Nevertheless I would urgently recommend that a telegram be sent to His Majesty*s Government at the earliest possible moment drawing their attention to the that the con tinued delay in commnxcating their final decision has created a situation here which is rapidly becoming more and more difficult* I have endeavoured to satisfy HI3 Highness by suggesting that a decision would undoubtedly have been communicated by now but for the fact that His Majesty* s Government must be fully preoccupied with the affair in Norway^but it would be idle to disguise the fact that explanations of this sort can give only very temporary ,r satisfaction end that His Highness and his Family are greatly puzzled and hurt by the apparent neglect of their interests. At least one Important member of the Family apparently believes that tne delay is due to the displeasure of His Majesty's Government at His Highness' decision to conclude an agreement with the American Company and tiie suggestion has even been made that in these circumstances it might be better for the Bahrain Government to re-open negotiations with another Company. Political Agent, Bahrain.i- .(IM- THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED 130 EAST 43BP STREET NEW YORK 1. W. THORNBURG vice president Hugh Weiglitman, Esq., H.B.M's Political Agent at Bahrein, The Agency, Bahrein. Dear Mr. Weightman, Awali, Bahrein: May 8, 1940. hslf \ 11 may {940 MMM i ■ '..-Si 2' Since the theatre of concession negotiations shifted from Bahrein to London last spring I have been four times in London - three times expressly on this matter. W % 3&gt; During my first visit there in March of this year things seemed to be moving very satisfactorily and we were informed that all questions with both the Petroleum Department and the India Office had been ironed out. During this visit I had agreed to a few minor changes they proposed in the concession papers, and mutual agreement was reached concerning several points in issue in the Political Agreement. One question remained, which as I understood had been referred to the Admiralty (Contract Department) for t revision at our request. This had to do with stipulating some reasonable period within which payment should be made in case oil were taken by H.M.G. The Contract Department had demurred, it appears, on the reasonable ground that since the price had to be detemined by Agreement (or arbitration) it was scarcely practicable to fix a time limit for the payment. The Admiralty then proposed what they termed a 'compromise arrangement', under -which a tentative payment would be made within a fixed time based upon H.M.G's idea of a proper price as defined elsewhere in the Agreement, leaving the adjustment, if any, to be made after agreement had been reached. This v/as satisfactory to us and I approved it immediately. Having reached this point I considered the matter as good as settled and departed for Bahrein. A week later, however, as I was ready to leave Rome for Bahrein, nothing final had been done so I returned to London with the thought that I might clear up whatever question remained by arranging to talk directly with the interested persons in the Contract Department. Since I am r ^Hugh Weightman, Esq. May 8. 1940 fully empowered to act for my company in such, matters, I supposed that by a direct meeting I might agree at once to some proposal of theirs. Apparently however this was not desired. Since then I have heard nothing except a cable from Mr. Ballantyne yesterday, in answer to one I sent him, saying 'No Progress'. After spending three months in London immediately after the declaration of war working with H.M.G. committees on oil supply, I do not need to be reminded that there is a war on and that all Departments are very busy. My general reply to that is that this affair is not without importance on the same ground, Neither do I need to remind you that since last spring we have gone ahead at our own risk on the assumption that the concession would be settled on us in due course, and that we have been and are now spending something like $30,000 a month on its exploration. This work has reached a point where it must either be stopped as completed pre liminary work, or continued on a considerably different program as detailed examination. The latter course will involve commitments for organization and special equipment running into substantial figures and over quite an extended time. Obviously we do not wish to go into such a program, even assuming we can obtain the necessary permission from Bahrein and H.M.G., unless we are assured of the concession. On the other hand, to stop it now will mean suspending it for a long while, since once the organization is broken up the men and special equipment will be scattered over the world on other jobs. Under the proposed new agreement you will recall that we are allowed 2^- years within which to drill any favorable area found. ^ Apart from this, you are aware^that we have faith fully observed the spirit of our 'letter of intention', given to Sheikh Hamad as part of the consideration for the new concession, according to which we were to endeavour to maintain Bahrein production at about 20,000 bbl/day, general economic and commercial conditions permitting. This was of course without guarantee and without even implied effect unless and until the concession was granted to us. Never theless, and in spite of considerations which well have excused us from the obligation even though it had become^ operative, (I refer to the Arabian situation) we have main tained Bahrein production at 20,000 bbl/day, and for no other reason than to avoid diminution of Bahrein revenue.r - 3 - Hugh Wei^htman, Esq . May 8, 1940 . In case tlie full force of this has escaped you, I shall point out that we have already paid advance royalties for a good while to come in Arabia, and have been able to produce and deliver to Bahrein far more Arabian crude than was actually sent to Bahrein. Even without the 'letter of intention' we would not willingly have reduced Bahrein production to an extremely low figure, but we could advantageously have reduced it to around 14,000 bbl/day. Thus, in effect, we have voluntarily contributed something like |1000 a day in duplicated royalties to Bahrein, and for the better part of a year. I can assure you that our parent interests at home have not been pleased about this, nor with me for having insisted on its continuance for so long. I must say that I cannot ^ urge it any longer. Lacking contractual protection Bahrein, like all other commercial developments, must expect sooner or later to take a place commensurate with its real importance in the world-wide oil picture. The last time I talked directly with Mr. Peel he - or it may have been Mr. Walton since they were both present - asked me whether Bahrein's interests were suffering by reason of the delay in completing this deal. Thatwas last November. I replied that I could not honestly say they were, inasmuch as we were quite voluntarily carrying on just as we would if the new agreement were in effect. I excepted of course the 4 Lakh down payment, but added that we were^ prepared to advance that too if the Sheikh needed it in view of his recent cash gift to H.M. On my last two visits to London I was not able to see Mr. Peel but I indicated through formal channels that Bahrein interests almost inevitably would^suffer unless the new concBSsion agreement were made effective reasonaoly soon - not as an expression of chagrin on our part but simply because of deep seated changes in wsrld oil economy. I think it only natural however, that H.M.a. Offices in London will expect to hear not from me but from Bahrein, when Bahrein s interests are likely to be adversely affected. I feel sure that you and I have worked together Ions enough that you will not seek out any facied trace of threat in what I have said. Any such effort on my part would be completely silly. Yours very truly.i' V v v Confidential ^ D.C,No • G/401-10/14• Dated 'the 10'th May 1940* yr In sw depress latter Ho.C/378 dated the first May 1940 1 reported the growing of the Shaikh of Bahr-in and his Family at the non-arrival of His Majesty^ ('♦overnment 1 s final decision regarding the lease of the Unallotted Area* In case that report is insufficient to secure a more urgent examination of the question, I think it would be as well to indicate now the grave results that may attend continued inactivity. It is evident from India Office p -tf 4- telegram No* 2842 dated the 11th November 1939 that at that time His Majesty's Government had considered whether delay might not cause material loss to Bahrain, and it is true ^ ^that time Bahrain interests were not affected# This however is not the case today ~ six months later. 2* From the correspondence forwarded with India Office Printed letter Mo, 1684/40 dated the 29th March 1940 it is evident that agreement has been reached on all outstanding points relating to the Political Agreement with the exception* of the question of the time within which payment should be made for oil taken by His Majesty 1 s Government. It is of course time that up to the end of March His Majesty 1 s Governmait expected to make use of t he Shaikh* s intervention in taking over crude oil &amp;nd its products and that it was necessary r to draw attention to the legal inconsistency between this pro posal and the provisions of the Bahrain Order-in-Councilj but it is equally clear from their letter No. P.Z.1888/40 dated the 8th April 1940 that the India Office have accepted the cohtention raised by the Gulf, which in effect Involves ^he Hon' ble Lieutenant Colonel x only /- 0.6.Prior, C•I•K., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.only the excision of a word or two from the draft pre-emption schedule. Thus there still seems little reason to doubt 'the correctness of the statement that 'the sole question im peding the final decision is the time within which payments are to be made; and as for this I am informed that the Admiralty themselves at the end of March proposed a scheme of tentative payments with provision for later adjustments, which the Company stated they were prepared to accept. Another month has however gone by without any decision being communicated. All this may seem a somewhat tedious preamble 9 but it seems well to visualise, as early as we can at this end, the the cause no less than the effect of the hold-up. 3. The first effedt of continued delay will be the aban donment of the geophysical exploration of the shoal waters included in the ( so far) Unallotted Area. The Company began this work last year in the belief that the new concession would be signed andsealed before they had gone very far. They have been spending not far from Rs.90,000 a month on this work and what may be called the preliminary part of the task is finished. If they are now to carry on with it they must at once purchase new equipment and prepare for a programme on a far more costly basis. I am informed defin itely that the Mew York and San Pransisco offices will not consider this until the new lease is signed. The present position is that they have a G.S.I, party with marine experi ence here and that unless a decision is communicated in the very near future so that they can star* work again Immediately after the Barah this party will be dispersed — and will be difficult to reassemble. This alone would be sufficiently damaging to Bahrain interests. 4. Secondly it must be remembered that until the new lease is signed neither the 'Royalty protective' clauses in it nor /-| - 3 - hV I v nor ( this is even more important) the Company's 'declaration of intention' contained in their letter of the 5th June 1939 (cf. penultimate paragraph of my Express letter No .C /376 dated the 10th June 1939) become operative. So far the Company have maintained Bahrain production at an average round about 20,000 barrels a day. This is being done in the face of considerable pressure from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company as I have reported from time to time, and recent developments have intensified this pressure. As you know the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have had to advance very considerable suns to Ibn Saud which are to be adjusted against Royalties and not unnaturally their argument is that having in effect paid advance Royalties on Arabian Crude oil they want to export that oil. This can only be^at the expense of Bahrain - and the parents of both Companies are the same. It is also not without significance that the decision has been taken to build a refinery of 25,OCX) barrels per day capacity at Ras Tanura. There are other recent developments which also have a bearing on the whole question of oil marketing; the interruption of traffic through the Mediterranean which one would imagine is bound to result in at least a part of the Anglo-Iranian exports to England being diverted to the Eastern Hemisphere j the closure of the German market; and major developments in the United States and Colombia which you will probably have seen reported in oil journals of the last few months and which must have a very considerable effect on oil economics. 5. It seems to me that every day that passes without a decision jeopardises more and more Bahrain's prospects of receiving Oil Royalties on a maintained production of 20,000 barrels daily. Admittedly the Company's 'letter of intention' has no real contractual value but the fact remains that in the circumstances /--4- ^ circumstances of this part of the Y S j orld it is pretty nearly ' as good as a contract unless the Company can convince the Shaikh that obstruction caused by the delay which has occurred in London has provided them with adequate grounds for Revising their Intentions. 6. One does not need to be reminded that there is a war on and that eveyy one, particularly at the Admiralty, is working at very high pressure. But surely it must be an important part of our war policy to maintain the position that we have gained in this part of the Gulf; and it is scarcely necessary to remark that if dilatorlness in London results in Bahrain production being cut back, with a consequent diminution of the Shaikh's Royalties, that position will be lost over-night. In less than four weeks from to-day a full year will have expired since the Shaikh of Bahrain sent in the draft Agreement and sought the advicfi of the British Government. It seems there is only one point out standing, and for that point the Admiralty themselves have proposed a solution. Why then should the existing situation continue, fraught as it is with such grievous possibilities ? Yours sincerely.No. To From Telegram India Office, London.

Dear Sir: of Further Modification of June 19, 1940, whereby the Company agrees to pursue structure drilling within tte Additional Area, we are hereby requesting the GoTernment *s permission to drill holes for structural information cm Hawar Island. At this time, we cannot say how many holes would be Justified; but in all probability one on the north end and one on the south end will be sufficient at present. If a suitable supply of potable water is developed in connection with this investigation and if the Government so desires, we will attempt to complete one or two such holes as water wells. If practicable, drilling will be perfomed by a water well drilling outfit. Yours very truly Chief Local Representative, THE BAH?EIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD, cc - C.

I received a large scale map from Air Headquarters in the late Spring and had intended to complete this photo graphic map in certain respects in which it is deficient by a personal visit to Hawar with Squadron Leader Coates who had offered his assistance in tracing an addition to the map. Unfortunately, with the outbreak of total war in early May, neither of us were able to leave Bahrain for the length of time necessary before the heat of summer made our proposed operation impossible.

The position of this fasht is considerably nearer to the Arabian Mainland than it is to Bahrein and we have already heard that questions regarding our activity in that locality have been raised in Arabia.

Confidential No. of 1360 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 26th Rajab, 1360 August 18, 1941. Reference your memorandum No.C/795-10/l dated 26th July, 1941. The application for permission to drill a well at lasht Ahu Saafa was considered by His Highness and the senior Shaikhs. They were of the opinion that Fasht Abu Saafa is recognised as being one of the Bahrain diving anchorages in the same way as Fasht al Jarim and Fasht al Dibel are known to be Bahrain anchorages. In both the latter places fresh water wells have been drilled which are of great value to divers and beacons were erected by the Bahrain Government some years ago. The Shaikhs considered that it would be advantageous if a well was drilled at Fasht Abu Saafa and if no other party lodged an objection the ownership by Bahrain of this fasht would be established. The question was discussed again in view of your letter. The Shaikhs are at all times anxious to avoid displeasing His Majesty King Ibn Sauod and if the fisht is now claimed as belonging to Saudi Arabia they are willing to withdraw any claims to it. It has been suggested in the past that the owner ship of the reefs and islands lying between Bahrain and His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:-- £ - o Saudi Arabia should be discussed and that a line should be drawn dividing the two areas.

But nothing v i ) has come of it, V'''i. ■ ' ■ 6, In the meantime the Bahrain Petroleum Co a?) any are pressing for our approval to their Requests to be allowed to drill in these reefs, the assent of His Highness having already been obtained. If the line suggested by Weight man is eventually agreed to, the four banks i.e, Adala, Jarim, Ashira and Abu Saafa will all come within the Bahrain sphere, The Bahrain right to Adala and Jarim could not be disputed, I think, and in any case the Company have already drilled on the latter. Permission to drill on these two might therefore be given at once. to Sir Trenchard, Ashira /-Ashira is further away but as it is well to the east of the suggested, line ob4 e ctioiis from the Saudi authori ties are urilikely and permission might also be given in this As regards Abu Saafa, this reef is sxich closer to Saudi Arabia than to Bahrain, although still to the east of our suggested line* it is no doubt used Bahrain pearl divers but mst also be used by pearlers from Qatif, Ibre- over the Cofflpany's activities at Abu Saafa have aroused soas comment on the mainland. As will be seen from Belgrave's letter to me, the Shaikhs are not so sure of their ground but suggest that a trial oe made and if the Saudi authorities object, withdraw. 7, As it is the Saudi Government have failed to follow up the demarcation of spheres question , I suggest that per mission be given in the case of Abu Saafa also and the result be watched# If they do object, perhaps the best course at present, during wartime, would be to request the Shaikh the Bahrain Petroleum Company to stop work there and also to request the Saudi authorities to leave the bank alone until the question of their respective spheres is settled. We appear to be on fairly safe ground in view of the good feelings entertained towards each other by ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Bahrain. 8. i would be grateful for instructions as to ®hat reply I am to give the Company in these cases. case.

S, W predecessor, in paragraph of his letter, had pro posed to reply to the Company that there was no objection to the drilling of the holes on the main Hawar Island. As regards the present reouest for permission to bore a third hole on bhe sand bank named Sowad Janubiya, my feeling is that although these banks appear to belong to the Haw. r group awarded to Bahrain yet in view of the fact that they are partly submerged and are very close indeed to the Qatar shore it would have been better had the Company confined themselves to on the main island, until such time at any rate as the exact boundaries of the group have been laid down. 4. I would be grateful to know what reply to give the Company. Political Agent, BahrfOffice of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Ramadhan 2, 1360 September 23, 1941 His Britannic Majesty*s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- With reference to the application of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to drill three holes for structural information at Hawar Islands con- ^ 1 mi ■in ^ tained in their letter No. FA-461 dated 20th September, 1941, of which a copy was sent to you. The Bahrain Government is most anxious to obtain a water v^rell at Hawar and a short time before this application was made the Government was considering drilling at Hawar in order to try and obtain water. If this drilling could be done by the Company's expense it would be to the advan tage of the Bahrain Government. One experimental well was drilled by the Government on Hawar Island some years ago but no water was obtained, it is possible that water may be found in other locations on the island.

No objection to Company drilling on Adala and Jarim.Telegram From To Repeated Ho. 181 Dated 15th received 17th October 1941. Bahrain Petroleum Company have applied for permission to drill on the following reefs ; (i) Adala (2) the south end of Fasht al Jarim (3) Ashira and (4) Fasht abu Saafa. Adala is just north of Fasht al Jarim, Ashira still further nofcth and Bu Saafa is 38 north and 6 miles west of Kalaiah rock on Fasht al Jarim, vide Admiralty chart Ho. 2837 B. It transpires that permission to drill on all four had been given by the Bahrain Government without reference to Agency and matter came to notice v/hen Mr, Lipp took over as Chief Local Representative. This aspect of the matter is being dealt with separately. 2. (1) and (2) are clearly within Bahrain waters and I have sanctioned drilling here. (3) and (4) are in a different category. The proposals for a division of this area rest with our Express letter No. A mi s. t Political Resident, Bushire Secretary of State for India, London Government of India, Simla.

Tf Weightman* s suggestion is followed both Ashira and Bu Saafa will fall within Bahrain area, 3. Bahrain has good claim to (3) but before sanctioning drilling on Bu Saafa Belgrave consulted ohaikhs who clainied it as a reef used by Bahrain pearling dhows, though they were prepared to withdraw(?) if Ion Baua book strong attitude. Company commenced operations but did not continue on hearing that matter had attracted attention on mainland. 4. In Arab eyes, both (3) and (4) are on(?) no- man's-land and open to all. Since however Saudis did not ultimately respond to proposal that they should send representative to discuss this area there seems no reason why we should deter Company. I recommend therefore that they should be allowed to proceed on both (c$) Ashira and (4) Bu Saafa. Company's main object is to secure geological information and if they work quietly this will be secured whatever deci sion may be. ResidentNo. C/997-10/14.

Dear Sir: ty^ A ■&gt; iti r In reply to your letter No. 0 1190-10/14 dated December 22, 1942, with reference to the drilling of structure holes on Fasht Abu Saafa and on A1 Ashira for the accumulation of geological infomation within the Additional Area, we wish to reiterate that we do not wish to be involved in any international controversy and we contend that the definition of the Saudi Arabian and Bahreini spheres of interest should be settled by the Governments concerned. With these thoughts in mind, the provisos outlined in the first paragraph of your letter are acceptable on the understanding that the Company is not held responsible for the violation of Saudi Arabian territory. Our Arabian associates inform us that the complaint received by them some time ago regarding our activity in the vicinity of Fasht Abu Saafa was made verbally by the Local Representative of the Bureau of Mines and Public Works. They have no inf ormation whether or not he submitted a report on the question to his Government. This information will be ascertained if possible. Acting on your permission to proceed with these two structure holes, we plan in the near future to place conspicuous Mid substantial markers on the locations for surveying purposes and we will proceed with drilling operations when opportunity permits. If, in the interim, any complaint is made or question is raised by the Saudi Arabian Government the opportunity will be provided for the complete review of territorial claims. Will you please advise if you are in agreement with our proposed procedure. Yours very truly, M. H.

If the Ruler of Saudi Arabia claims them His Highness will withdraw his claims. The Shaikhs have asked me to ascertain whether your attitude regarding these two shoals, that absence of objection cannot be regarded as establishing owner ship, refers particularly to the two shoals in question or is it the official attitude towards all such un occupied islands and reefs etc; around Bahrain. The Shaikhs are deeply concerned at the possibility of other neighbouring states, especially Qa&amp;tar, laying claims to some of the islands in Hawar group on which the Bahrain Government some years ago erected beacons. They would like an assurance that your letter refers only to Ashira and Fasht Bu Saafa although I have explained to them that from the context of the letter the ruling does not appear to be intended to apply to other islands than those mentioned.

'Ehe departure of the field party to undertake this work has now been arranged for Wednesday, October 14, 1942. For this work it will be necessary to use radio communication between Awali and the field party. The Awali transmitter, operating on the usual frequency of 3287 Kcs., will be used at this end and the transmitter on the launch 'Zellak', operating on the other allocated frequency of 6575 Kcs., will be used at Hawar. Conversations will be limited to the launch movements during transit time and reports on the well-being and requirements of the field party after arrival. The first party will consist of three Staff men who will spend 3-4 days on the island after which one Staff man (and occasionally two) will be on the island for a period of six weeks to two months with the exception of proposed weekly trips back to Bahrein for rest, replenishment of supplies, etc. During the period Staff employees are on the island, it is proposed to maintain two scheduled radio contacts immediately following the normal scheduled radio contacts with Dhahran (8.30 A.M. and 2.30 P.M.

The Company, at one time, considered drilling a structure hole in the Ali Plain; however, the desired geological information has since been obtained as a result of the recent deepening of the well in the Manama Palace Garden and the well in Muharraq. Municipality. Therefore the drilling of a hole in Ali Plain would be of no value to the Company and is not being further considered. Regarding structure drilling elsewhere, aside from the Hawar project, with the equipment at our disposal at this time and with the art of oil exploration in its present state of advancement, there are no further locations that the Company considers worth while drilling. However, I am referring the matter to our New York Principals for further review by their geologists. Yours very/t P. Anderson Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Ltd.

Last August in course of discussions about denial scheme Ballantyne stated his Company wished to obtain from Shaikh moratorium releasing them from obligation to continue drilling in additional area during war. He was told that we would see no objection to Company informing Shaikh that owing to war circumstances they considered themselves released from this obligation as matter of force majeure under Article 8 of Deed of June 19th 1940 but that we doubted ^ whether in view of Political Agent*s letter to you No.C/35 of January 10th last anything further need be said at this pi stage. We added that if Company felt any doubt about stopping work voluntarily military or other paramount local authority would if approached give written orders to suspend operations. 2. Substance of above was communicated by Company to Anderson who has replied that he has had preliminary dis- t - cession with 'local authority' presumably Political Agent. Latter is reported to have said that action suggested would be deplorable from psychological viewpoint and he would advise Shaikh against acceptance: that force majeure is an ugly word which would arouse Shaikh* s suspicions that he might lose minimum royalty; that it would be inappropriate to invoke aid of military who technically have no authority until they actually take over control of Government; and^2- -3^) that this latter method had led to differences in 'near by concession' presumably Qatar. He suggested Company should merely request release from obligations under Article 5 in view of war conditions. Anderson comments that only objection he can see is that presumably Company would not obtain any extension period of lease. 3. Company still feel matter should be handled on basis of suggestion in paragraph Nb.l above. Please telegraph your views so that I may advise Ballantyne. I am not clear as to objection seen to invocation by Company of force majeure especially if accompanied by satisfactory assurances regarding royalty. - retaxantum -te leg ram Jrom To Copy by sir mail to Government of India &gt; Hew Delhi.

He suggested that Con might a sic for extension of duration of concession in respet of additional area tc cover time now lost and that as this extension would be valueless witnout similar exteneion of main c mcession that also should be extended accordingly.

Matter discussed further v;ith (omission ? Ballantyne ) who has now recommended to New York that in order to maintain good relations with Shaikh all mention of force majeure should be avoided: and that ? instead Company should ask for moratorium to remain in force while war conditions last, in respect of its obligations under Article 5. Use of term 'moratorium' would imply Company would be granted extension of concessionary period equivalent to period during which operations in additional area were suspended. It would also be understood that this extension would apply to total area under concession. Ballantyne points 'out 1940 Deed covered this total area; that concession must therefore be treated as one whole and not as two separate parts: and that any default by the Company in its obligations under 1940^Deed would be held to invalidate its rights in total area and not merely in additional area. 3. While I have thus accepted your view regard ing manner of approach to Shaikh, I am satisfied Company would be within their rights in invoking force majeure. Owing to universal shortage of drilling equip ment it would be inadmissible to use such equipment for / exploratory- 2 - exploratory drilling in additional area, especially when some proved Bahrain wells have been closed down for war time reasons. In all other oil areas in Middle East ^except Saudi Arabia where His Majesty's Government have no jurisdiction) drilling has been discontinued: and if Company were to attempt to drill in additional area it would be necessary to prevent them. 4. According to Ballantyne Company consider results of drilling so far undertaken in additional area give every ground for satisfaction. - HETAXANDT 7 !! -Conridentlal No. C/315 Political A-gency, Bahrain, the 6th March 1945. To The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, bahrain Dear Sir, You recently asked me to let you know what the position was vis-a-vis the Bahrain Government in respect of the Company's obligations under Article 5 (a) of the Supplementary Deed of 19th June 1940. S2. In his letter No. C0N-8iS aated the 18th Ma^y 1941 the Chief Loca_l Representative (Dr. Kennedy) wrote to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government advising him of the Company's difficulties in carrying out structure drilling in the Additional Area and informing him that the Company would pursue structure drilling to the best of their ability and to the limits justified by the results obtained. He asked for the Bahrain Government's written recognition and approval or this programme which was conveyed in the Adviser's letter to the Chief Local Representative, No. 1003-*&lt;J0 dated the 8th Ju~~ or discussions wnicn naa tasen pxace oetween your Company and the India Office in England a year earlier, the Political Agent wrote to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government on the 30th of November 1941. In tnis letter he stated that the Bahrain Petroleum Company wished to suspend exploration work in the Additional Area in order to concentrate on production and refinery and in order to minimise non-essential labour requirements; and he asked the Adviser to conl'irm that, in view or the undertaking in Article 5 (a) of the Supplementary Deed of 19th June 1940, His Highness was agreeable to the suspension by the Company of exploration work in the Addition al Area. 4. On the 7th of January 1942 the Adviser replied to the Political Agent's letter and stated that His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al Khalifah had 'no objection to the sjis- pension of exploration work in the new area at present«. 5. Up to date this is how the matter stands vis-a-vis the Bahrain Government. Yours truly.uek/ lvl 0 . ftclfco . • — i- ■ a - it ^&lt;0 ct • 'ia.|&gt;c|uv. ffi- i'5-) ^ujvlux ' Mr. '7ard Anderson came to see me today about the Company's obligations under Article 5 of the Deed of Further Modification dated 19th June 1940. 2. Mr. 7ard Anderson said that during 1940 exploratory drilling had been done, largely by the seismographic method, in the 'additional area'. Later a programme of structure hole drilling was taken up. Owing to difficulties caused by the Vlar the work had only bean proceeding .on a reduced scale but quite a number of holes had been dug. Results so far achieved had been in no .way conclusive. In any case such preliminary information as had been acquired needed con- firmation by other tests which the Company were not at present in a position to carry out. ■ 3. Mr. Ward Anderson said that there were three areas where useful work could still be done (i) Hawar (ii) the Northern reefs (Ashira, Fasht bu Saafa etc.) (iii) reefs off the Qatar' Coast opposite Zubara. Mr. Anderson » stated, and I agreed with him, that it would be undesirable at present for the Company to carry out a drilling programme in any of these three areas. 4. -Mr. Anderson stated that he had received instruc tions from his Principals to approach the Shaikh and inform him that they invoked Article 8 of the Deed of Further Modification to-exonerate them from their obligations under Article 5 of that Deed. Mr. Anderson quoted from the telegram* which he had received which said that the India , Office saw no objection to the Shaikh being informed that owing to circumstrnces caused by the War the Company con sidered itself released from its obligations under Article 5, the provisions of'Article 8 about force majeure being invoked to justify the moratorium sought by the Company. / The'i'he Cable added that if necessary Political or Military authorities would be ^sked to issue formal orders 00 the Company forbidding them to undertake further drill ing . 5, Mr. Anderson consulted me about the action he should take. I gave it as my view that it would be a mistake on the Company's part lormally and spt-ci fically to invoke Article 8 of the Deed ox Farther Modification since this would make the Shaikh suspicion^ lest, by admitting the existence of force majeure,ne would be releasing the Company from all their other 'obligations under the Deed of Further Modification in cluding the payment of a minimum royalty. It might, indeed, be necessary to take full advantage Ox Article 8 at some later period of the V/ar; but I though, it inadvisable, in present circumstances, to seek from the•Shaikh anything more than agreement to a moratorium in respect of Article 5. I suggested that the matter might be left for discussion until Colonel Prior visits Bahrain next month, but as I was unable to give a firm assurance that Colonel Prior would be visiting Bahrain in November, and as the period men tioned in Clause (b) of Article 5 expires in the second half of December 1942, Mr. Anderson thoughu it necessary to proceed with the case at once. It was therefore decided that he should put to his Principals the views which I had expressed, with which he himself agreed, and that I should discuss the position informally with the Adviser. 31/10/42. n &lt; Mpiut. ^ ^ $Liuiu* ft/V, j, jLJU. &amp; jvr</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000266_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/439</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000266</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/439</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 10/14 III Bahrain unallotted area'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-02-25T12:30:12</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (316 folios)</extent><extent>The documents in the volume are arranged in chronological order.
