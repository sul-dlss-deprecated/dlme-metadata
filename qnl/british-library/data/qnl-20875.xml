Bahrain 6th April 1907. P Vrfith reference to your U.O.letter of 26th March 1907, I think it is quite natural of the American mission aries to wish for some regular system under which notarial matters, includinp the registration of hirohs, IsPvths and marriages, can be fomally recorded, and the same feeling is equally strong amongst the other 'Europeans — ^nplish- iaen and Germans — in the place. The American Mission is composed largely of British subjects! In Bahrain alone during my time, there have been a Oanaiian lady doctor, an Australian lady missionary and an '^n^lish Doctor (Mylreflt th a wife. X- None of whom have any intention of _ 1 relinquishing their Britis h ? T ationality | wit? The 3 last named are here now, and as Mylrea has only been married six months it seems quite possible that even 'os will occur in his faiaily of a nature which he would like to have regisuered by a public Ilomry, for which at pre sent no provision i^hatever exists, as even you have no Notarial authority in Bahrain. I am strongly of opinion that uhe Political Agent should now be legally authorised to register births and deaths, to perform marriages, to record affidavits as a Consul does, to note protests, issue Bills of Health ^jid also do various other acts performed in British territory by Harbour-masters and x^ort Oii.ice~'s, '.-wid ii.x foreign countries by Consuls. If you are prepared to recommend these points to Qoverniiient, I think that the simplest answer uo rive the Americ^Ji Consul in Baghdad would be that the ixovernment of India have under consideration the question of dele gating to the ir'.A. various powers including those of a X I have heard the Zwemers say that the Cantines' marriage or their own {I forget which)was postponed for months because they couldn't get it civilly registered, at last the parties went to India for the event yirmly for this rpaso^- Public Totary and 1C Recorder of Marriages so that foreigners here would be inmuch the same position as if they were in, say, ^uetta or a provincial uovm in 'Inrland# They can. he sure of a per manent reoord by reporting cases of births &amp;c at t.he Political Ap-enoy, and if this is not suffidient for them they can take certified copies and arrange for their own nearest Consulate 'oo endorse the same and include them in their own records. As a matter of fact, I was asked once by ^Isenhut to attest his simatnie on a lerral document, a r'ower of Attorney, T think, which &gt;&gt;y a previous arranrement with the (rerman. Consul in .^ushire, he then forwarded to Dr liistemajin for endorsement, thus making the document a valid one in the n-erman Courts, It seems to me, however, that if T haven't previously been formally empowered by onr own (Government to do these things for British subjects, the Courts of other lowers would be perfectly justified in arruinf-' that there was no reason why they should accept my certificates on behalf of ^orelpner^ and in the case Just quoted. It uistemann might -ruite reasonabljr perhaps have insisted on -lisenhut going over to mshire* V/ith regard to the soTirce of the authorization which of course I contemplate as similar to an order in Council, I think that if Oovernment of India could issue it instead of the London '^oreirn Office, it would be better so. In Persia, British Consuls have their Commissions from the ^oreipn Office, and therefore it iras natural that the i^.C. and I. Order in Council should emanate from Xondon. But if the Government of India have the power to locate/ a Political Agent in Bahrain, I should think they would equally have the right to delegate to such an officer the A various powers and rights over British sub/jects j which ma^iy of their officials, Political Agents and Port Officers, perform in Indian. .Native States and Indian Ports. Bahrain is unaisputscily recognized as being within the Indian sphere, whereas Persian, with its SenSjQr British official appointed by the London foreign Office, is morea—■ .^- J / i un ler liondon clirecti'' than itn ler India.

Iftrb if any Shore officials m India also have this Jurisdiction, I su^nose there w-.ild be no nore difficulty aw it arranrirp this than any of the 'Totarial r'owers, 'lYhen I ims in Siala last mly, I learnt from the Po- reigu OiTice Olerk uho deals with Bahrain questions that lie .ms enfa^ed on tne subject of granting me Vice-Adiai- ■ *'^ 3 '-'is iiction, but X as':ed hii/i laj'self not to put up hia proposals iianedlately, aa I thought the bigger questionj o£ ^n. Order in ^oion.cll i Tould be soon coning up, r 'omm up, I think that a Gazette notification should issue from Simla, if possible, rather than an Order in Oouncil from Iiondon, but it should follow the lines of the i j .c. Se I. Order in Coraicil fairly closely. (a) With regard to Oriialnal Matters, it might, give me the bovvers ol a i-dstrict Jviagistrate, and also specify the Sessions Oourt and High Oourt to which serious cases can be coiiuaitted ax.d appeals be presented, and also the Jail for convicts to go to. At -resent, as X am not a J. a -,, a British viuropean subject might con dt a murder here and no Oourt whatever exists which could legally deal with his case I In Rajput ana and Central T r tla I think all the ± J oliul- cal Agents are Sessions Judges, and the A.G.G.s hav- the powers of a High Court. Besites being made a J.r., T also urgently beg to be given Summary jfowers. ye ^a^e a'utc a laige coj'tmunity of Nathan an.I xainjabi fakirs^pedlars uid shop-keepers here, who are frequently getting into' trouble for assaults-and petty thefts. In Ind'.a all Cantonment Magistrates Iiave Stimmary lowers, and siich offences as these can generally be disposed of in an ■ rbi 1 e if they ha^e to be tried with all the other formalities of the I.B.Iode they take lays to settle. It would be desirable X think for a monti/y return of oases t.rlfid Suj'8 iftrlly +.0 b© STibj-ii+.ted to yovtroffice. Besides 'Uieae poiirts on OriJiinal Ma't'ters, T 'think the Notification should take OognisRiice of the *♦Joint nourt* 1 and should empower the P#A. to treat British subjects in the matters of suoimoninp before it, taking bail or keeping - ■ x x I here contemplate the frequent 1 in custody during cases,in which a foreigner makes a coun' er-complaint against a British j trial, and carrying subject,and J 'it is more desirable that 'Hoth complaints should be tried! out or entorcm^ t^e at the same time. ^ . i — sentences m the same manner as if the trial were held under the Indian i^enal Code. (b) With regard to Civil Matters, it would perhaps be sufficient to empower the x J .A. to bring Suitors before the HaJ lis of Bahrain, or a mutual ^-elected Court of Arbitration, or if the parties • domiciles are in the s^me part of India, to take measures that the3 r shall appear in an Indian Court within a reasonable time. There Jii^ht per haps be no harm in making me also a Subordinate Judge of the First Class, but I would prefer as much as possible to compel Suitors if of the same mercantile class to appear before Arbitrators or fight out their ,cases, such as part nership disputes and breaches of contract, in bneir 6 -m country. (c) Vice-Admiralty. I notice in the i J .C. &amp; I. Or ler in Council i-'art I Section 3 (1) that uhe definioi 'n •♦ r'fcrsian Coasts Islands includes the territorial water of Persia adjacent to the said coast and islands 1 *. I Jiope therefore that in the new notification the expression x or 1 •territories* 1 * 1 1 * lo li '' This t&amp;nh will provide for a possible | , , Arill re-open ing of tjie claim to ?ubara eGc | x.iono include its territorial waters. See also x-'art II.5.(ii) * 'The j^.C. ^ I Order anplies to British ships v T lthin ohe Persian coast and islands 1 '. (d) Registration of British subjects. I think this should certainly be ordered, and in addi- tion the resistration of all imovable properties alreadj- acquired, while in the future the proposed purchases of1 iimuoveahle property hy iBritish suhjecta shoTild be reported, to and concurred in by the Political Aprent, as the Chief is debarred from allowing the sale of lands to all foreign ers without the Go^ernent of Indian consent. (e) With, regard to the Notarial'and Shipping duties, the powers granted to the Political A^ent should be described in extensjD on the lines of the Consular Regulations and Indian Shipping Acts or Harbour Regulations (?) as these Bnactments cannot be referred to themselves, and suitable fees, which would be credited to (Government should be imposed in all cases. At the present time T perform many duties, for which a Consul would take fees, gratis to oblige Commanders and Hakhodas, but I ion 1 1 see why (fovernment should lose when the applicants are generally quite prepared and expecting to be called on for payment. In .Iraftin^ a Notification for (toverrjient, I think some of the Indian Acts should be referred to as well as any recent Orders in Council such as that for Somaliland Protectorate, As I have only access to the very condensed gist of the P,C,&amp; I, Order which is printed in Aitchison's Treaties Vol X, I am not in a position, I 'm afraid, at present to draft a satisfactory Notification, ir &gt; ,S,V/ith regard to the Consular authority to whom the Ame- ricajis should have recourse if they wish to correspond,in the way I have surrested of getting him to emdorse ray cer tificates, I hope earnestly that they will be persuaded to coi u ami cats with the one at Maskat rather than the one in &gt;aghdad. They themselves have no branch at Baghdat,so that it would seem much more reasonable that the Consul at Maskat should have the supervision of the branches outside of Turkey, vis, at present, Baiirain &amp; Maskat: and besides this, Maskat is nearer America, and further, if the1 Mission ever falls foul of its British 'protectors whether at Kowait or in Trmjial Oman or in one of their head quarter stations (Basra excepted), it would be easier for the American Consul at Maskat to get, into coi-inunication with you than for his colleague at Baghdad, In Basra, I think there already is an American Consular Agent, so that the Mission ^robaMy there have no relations whatever with the British Consulate, $0 ♦ % ♦No. 188 of 1907.

Strictly speaking, how- ever, he has no legal authority for undertaking these latter duties.3. With a view to define and regularise the powers exercised over British sub'ects by the Agent, the Politioai • vide paragraph 6 of enclosure No. 5. Resident in the Persian Gulf* has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to be a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation, but with reference to clause 2 of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, we under stand that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of j His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would accordingly request that, if His Majesty's Government see no objection, the necessary Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. / 4. But, further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has already caused practical difficulties, it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf, provision should be made in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the legal duties of a protecting power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty involving perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign powers. Bahrein has been under sole British domination since 1820, and on several occasionsf we have had to Petsil ^uS No f 2S da™ mwte by armed force, either to prevent N0 ' the Chief 0f Bahrein from attacking his neighbours, or them from attacking him, or to settle masters relating to the Chiefship. In 1880, by a treaty published for public information, the Sheikh bound himself to abstain from making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British and to refuse to permit other Powers to establish diplomatic or Consular Agencies or coaling depots without the consent of the British Government. This treaty in itself constituted a sort of protectorate, which has perhaps been ripened into maturity by the open and regular exercise of protectorate powers, more : vidf encioBures i and 2. especially in the recent cases ot attacks b § i8 ,i r eI ' uiia0lficelettei ' datedtlie 4th Septem ' 0n -^ ers ^ an an( i German subjects in II vide India office letter, dated the 28th July Bahrein.

Sir,- I an lirectecl V lAr Secretary ^orley to inclose,to be laid before the Secretary of rt.ate for Foreign Affairs, copy of a Secret letter from the P-overnnant of Tndia as to the judicial powers of the Political /.gent in Bahrain. The 'overnnent of 'naia reconnend,v7ith a view to defining and regularizing the powers now exercise a by the Political Agent over .British subjects, that an Order in Council shonld be Tironnlgated 'inder which he should be appointed a Tustice of the Peace, ana endowed with the powers of a district Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay, ^t is further reconnended that the Order in Co'incil should be so franed,if possible,as to enable the Political /gent to per form the functions of a notary public. Mr xiorley considers that thtse recountndations nay be adopted, and would connend then for Sir L.Orey^s consideratio The nore difficult question of providing by Order in Council for the jurisdiction of the British Political /.gent over foreigners is raised in paragraph 4 of the letter of the -overnnent of India. Ar . lorley assunes that British protectin over Bahrain is a fact, and that it Is desirable to pu lish it in due course by taking such public action as is suggested 'The only nuestion is whether the present opportunity is favourable to the adoption of that course,and whether it is not preferable to continue action on the above assumption until a long usage has bet n established. Such was the view taken in Mr Brodricli 1 s despatch of the 10th Fovember 1^05.^t is possible,however,that Sir iJ.Orey naj consider that recent developnents of the situation-in the ^ulf require a definite public notification of the rights that His Majesty's Oovern- mnnt possess and intend to exercise as the Protecting PovTer in Bahrain.n Ac to the notifications, apa^t fron the Treaty of 13 30, p^iblisheu. in volume x of ,, /..itchiGon , % that have been naae in the pact to fort ign povrers to vrhich the ^overnnent of ^naia refer,it nay be observea that the Tui^ish Oovernnent have never,so far ,as ^Ir .Jorley is aimre,accepted the cieclaration of o*\r protectorate repeatedly nacle to then.

The sinplest solution of the ruestion vrou.la be to extena the Pesidtnt's Consular j^risaiction in the re quired airection without t-he issue of a separate Order In Council.He could then issue a warrant appointing Mr Gashin to be ^ice-Consul at Bahrain, Mr Gashin would thus be ena' led by virtue of his office to pi rforn the functions of a notary publi ana the powers conferred upon hin would,for all the present practical pHfpesee renuirenents of Bahrain^ be anple. If,howeve a separate Order in Council is required,it should,I thinh,be franed Virith a view to extend the Resident's Consular jurisaic tion ana not to create a separate ana independent Consular appointment as at Muscat-.• i?' At the sane tine, I an inclined' to aonbt vrhether the re mi re nents of the case jnotifj the issue of a separate Order in Conncil to provide for Consular jurisdiction at Bahrain and the other places in the ~ulf not already provided for V Orders in Council. The Assistant Political A^ent is alreaoy invested with nagisterial powers in crininal cases ovtr British T ndian subjects,and there are at present no European British subjects at Bahrain. The want^therefore,of Cons'ilar jurisdiction has not hitherto been felt to any appreciable extent,and the i object of ny letter dated the 16th January was nerely to suggest that notarial powers should be conferred upon the Assistant Politi cal Agent so as to enable hin to ^xrforn certain notarial functions ana levy fees for so doing. As a natter of fact,Court in India are not', I think, libely to dispute the validity of the Assistant Political Agent*s attestation of aocuntnts,ana the question of the levy of fees is not of much inportance. 'f, therefore,a separate Order in Council is required to invest the Assistant Political /.gent with Consular rank,I an aisposed to think that there is at present no justification for the neasure. 4. In connection with the extension of Consular jurisdiction to Bahrain, it is, I think,necessary to bear in nina that altrou we have an agreenent with the Chief of iSarrain whereby xoreign Consular Agencies cannot be established in Bahrain without the consent of the British ^overnnent, it nay ^er aps ^e convenient to maintain this position in the event of British Consular Consular Jurisdiction x ing extended to Bahrain. The Gernan Consul a 4 :- Bush ire inf ornc d ne 1 once in course of conversation that he considered his j uis— aiction in the ^ulf to extend whereever nine aia,and I think he saia that his instructions fron his ^overnnent were to \ this effect. This point has not,of course,©scaped the notice of the ^overnnent of India, v ut I nention i + - so as to nakc n^ present report as conplete as possible.IncloEnre 10 in Fo.1, X j Major Cox to ^overnnent. of Inuia, 13tiGh i re, Fe 1 r'lary 2 5, 1^06 • I have 'the honbur to refer to Foreign r| epartnent letter, iate'd the 4th May, 1^01^ to t-ht aacirecs of nj prt aec^ssro,on th.e oubject of the adninictration of j'ictice in Bahrain in cases in which European fortigners are concerned.

On conclusion of the conversation,ny colleague saia that he lad been ashing for personal enlighnnent as a new coner,and since then I have heard no nore fron hin on the subject in question. ?. The question of the fornation ana status of this Medjliss has recently been brought into sone m-oninence in connection ^ith the case of clains against the estate of one Syyid Khalaf^ deceased,v/ith regard to uhich I have addressed the ^overnnent of Inaia in ny letter of today's date. Search has been nade in the Bushire records for any correspondence throwing light on the origin of this Tribunal,but nothing has up to the present been fo'md,noi7 does it aopear that i'' Has an arrangenent introduced specially at the instance of the Pesidency,nor that the Resident has hitherto exercised any revisionary powers over it. The institution seens to have been developed autonatically in the days of our native Agents,and to have,up till recently fulfilled its purpose nuietly ana adequately. T attach a Meno- r an dun on the subject,conpiled fron sone incidental references to the subject in communications received fron our present Political Agent. 4. Vith reference to the position of foreign European ner- chants in Bahrain,! learn fron Captain PrideaT^ 4 'hat the four representatives of the Gernan firn of vrhich Herr Tr onckhaus is the principal are still in the habit,vjh.en in conversation wi h, hin,of harming Tipon their clain to extra-territoriality in Bah rain both in regard to crininal ana connercial nat' ers.■J/ Captain Pricleaux consiaer^in fact, that they v/onla aefinite iy refuse to go before the Shaikh's Tri-mals,anathat if we were to say that this Mecijliss with local nerchants sitting on i ,ana he. British Eepresentative supervising the finaing, is a Territorial Court,they would perhaps object even to that, -'■ x ^ on f 0 '^r and,we say that the Meciliss is a Go-irt which the Protecting Power in consultation with 'he Chief has tvolvea for the settlenent of disputes in -which British su r j^cts or Europeans claining o'ir gooa offices are concerned,it woi\ld seen to anord theu an opening for ashing us to define' our position nore precisely. Por present purposes I ashed the Chief infomally at ny in terview on ' ^e 14th intant to agree that,pending any further comnunication between tis on the sif^ject, findings cone to 1 y the Medjliss sitting at the Agency should be considered as sub ject to nodification by the Political Agent in consultation with h ins elf. Shaikh cisa, in the event of the European foreigner concerned not being satisfied with the settlenent nade by the Medjliss. I trust that,pending full consideration of the subjec the Oovernn^nt of India will a^^rove of this arran rtnent. 5. The present position beong as described in the foregoing paragraphs,the ^-overnnent of India wil 1 perhaps concur with ne in thinking that the question of the adninistration of justice in Bahrain at. the present tine requires to be placed on a nore precise footing,both in view of the gradual influx of buroceans into the island and of the nodified situation brought about by the appointnent of a fully qualified gazetted officer of the superior status to represent our interests. 6. In connection with the question of the Judicial position of the latter,! beg to reftr to the correspondence ending with Colonel Aenball's 1etter addressed to the roreign ' 1 epartnent on the Snd July 1^02,on the subject of 'he a~opointnent of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrain to be a notary public, and would ask that the cuestion of the issue of an Order in Council for Bahrain nay again be taken into consider a' 5 ion.If It. is tho-v^t. necess ary to ?lve our Representative Consu- ir stattts flor chM-ies in connection with ntrchant shlnnin-', len perhaps the terns of his a^pointntnt in that capacity ight nomnaliy refer only to Aatar ana Katlf,ana not to -iahrai Ac regards Bahrain,it tronld seen most convenient that he tumid be appointed a Justice of the Peace ana endowed with the owers of a snhoriinate Jnage with appeal to the ■Resident in le Persian hi.lj.,or vfltli + hose of a district T udge in direct aooi ciinatjion o l'hc Co^iPij of 13on? ■ cbjr♦ Ar,ov/ever,'■ he precise natnre of the powers which it is ecesnary to give hin^and the nanner in vjhich it ohotila be onc^iL incepara- le iroia the larger question of our ovm relati^ n regard, to ISahx^ain^it BetnG advioahle for ne at this stage erely to conrena the su' Jtct ■'o the v/ise consideration of the overnnent of India in conjunction with the other rut,s' ions meeting Bahrain which J ari now reporting 'ipon•Inclocnre 11 in TT o, i lienor an aim regarains We Ba/rsi-n v, n-i^^ ^ o ® Dd * Ia ' ln ^eajlisa^or Pemanent ^ative I- alive Court, 01 Ar T itratlon,, ciated February P,B, 1^06, -or la^ + . ior + .y-nine yearn or nore it has been custon- ary here,v/hen conner-ial ainpntes have arisen between British subjects or proteges on the one hand ana Bahrain subjects or persons ox a ny o T her nationality on the other,for the Britir Agent, xirs' 4 *- native anj. subsequently Unglish - to assenble a Court of Arbitration, locally called a ^edjliss,fornud fron a body of respectable persons whose nanes are borne on a per manent lio ,_ 01 • le-' earing and adj 'iai cation of the case# This practice at its origin received the assent of the Chief,and the list includes a nuuber of the nost influential 8unni,Shiah,and Hindu 'ndian merchants of Bahrain.

It will tend to strengthen our position in BaLr )lh, and to remove risks of interference by other Fowers, if Jurisdic tion over foreigners iplaced in oar hands. But our protect orate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction over their subjects by the Political Agent, it will be preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners.

It will be remarked that a good many alterations h ive been suggested, but I trust that I am not mietaxien in thinking th^t in i ■H &gt; -n ■in forwarding the draft for oommant th« v,, / wnL tli ^ uovernmant of India reallsad that conaiderable rnodificationo -. h . oe necessary in crdar to maet poculiar local oondltlona, and in that belief I have ventured to regard the draft rather a s having been sent ue as a working ba 8 i s th W as a definite assertion of the views of government oven in regard to fundamental points. 4. As regards most of the alterations suggested, I beg that the annotated copy now submitted with this letter nay be accepted as in itself supplying the needful explanation^ of our views in points of detail. There are certain primary questions, however, which it is neceasary that I should touch upon here. Including the two subjects specially referred to in the foreign Department oommunication abovementioned, namely the question of the position of Foreigners aa regards jurisdiction undet the Order, and the need for Hegietration. 5. In the Foreign Department draft the definition of 'Foreigner' was worded, 'A subject or citizen of a state in a. ity i?ith His •iudjesty, other than Bahrain', It is now Bu .;gested that it be al tered to, '/uiy person not a subject of Bahrein'; the reason for the suggestion bein^ that there are denominations a; on^ the in habitants and frequenters of Bahrein of whom it c in hardly be said that tiiey come /ithin the former category. Under present conditions the term 'Foroi ner' in Bahrein en- braces the following denominations in practice:- (i) Subjects of Christian Powers. (ii)Subjects of Turkey and Persia and other non-Christian POWft-PR . (iii) Dependents of petty .iohammedan liulers on the shores or hinterland of the uulfs of Persia and Oman, such as the Trucial Coast Uhaikhs and the iiuler of ^oweit, enjoying a greater or lese measure of protection from the British doverrimont. (iv) Natives of i^atar or other semi-independent tracts ntol enjoying any measure of British protection outside Bah rein. Since the events of the winter of 1904-1905, ending with the ultimatum to Shaikh as a arid the deportation of his nephew shaikh Ali bin /Uimed, the pz^otection or good offices of the vgency have . . beenbeen extended when asked to persona of all the above cate 0 ories, ana the usage has so far received the recognition and acquies cence Ox the shaikh, taat liie officials :ire now in the habit of bringing members of them spontaneously to the British Agency for the investigation and adjustment of th .ir claims. This development operates greatly in our favour, as enhanc ing our good name and influence among the trading classes of the Gulf and enaijling t-he latter to obtain a measure o ' even- handed justice wi.ich otherwise they could hardly hope to get. It operates especially in fav ur or the diving fraternity# an oppressed and deserving class, vho can nox count upon getting I'air treatment at the hands of the Jalif Ja Court, .vhich, but for our good offices, would often be denied them. It will be understood, however, that under tui^ com; r tensive definition of the term Foreigner, the onuo of protection .vhich hae gradually been forced upon us xnd of Jhich we can hardly now divest ourselves, becomes a somewhat heavy one, aid necessitates in my judgment, the provision of a system of Registration for the res triction and control of it. On these grounds a set of regulations i'or 1?^ i tr at ion has been included under »?hich a Foreigner, while in any oase subject zo adverse jurisdiction of the agency wnen necessary, .ill not be entitled to claim it unless registered. ] In paragraph 2 of the Foreign Department communication under reply it was stated that reference to Segistration had^prc ^i.don- fally been omitted on the ground that the i (..-li •-iw Agexit c ^^s i&gt;.A exercise Consular powers, but as ray opinion was asicod on the sub- Jeot, I pres -ume that the application of regulations xor Registra tion by a i'olitioal Agent io not considered wholly inpraoticadg on any teclinical grounds. 6. The third fundamental modification «bi«b been suggested and which needs explanation here concerns the ;uartur to -J-.h Appeals shall lie from the Uourt of the acli-x-U ..gent rein. in this connection it will be noted that m x ..o.76Of 25th February 1906 and in Government of India Letter No.l-G 188 (Secret External) oi' 14tli November 1907 to uis -.ajesty's Secretary of State, it was suggested that the District Court at Bahrein bhould be subOi'u.ina,te to the riigh Court at Bombay. The '-lose exajiination oi this question, however, from all points oi view has brought the Political Agents and myself to tha unanimous opinion that it will be against the interests of the Bahrein community and our political interests, that Appeal should lie to the high Court, and it is therefore hoped that the U-overnment of India will see their way to recommend that the Qourt of the Resident in the Persian Gulf be constitiited the 'Chief Court' for purposes of Appeals under this Order. I submit that the grounds in favour of the adoption of this c urse are cogent. Firstly, it may be claimed under article 4 of Friendly Con vention of ld61 with Bahrein, and by ri ht of ^ell-established usage since, that disputes between British subjects and de pendants (now including Foreigners since the Jltimatum of 1905), and Bahpeinis on the other hand, are subject to the deciaion of j the Political Resident should the British Agent ind Local Autho-| I rities fail to settle them satisfactorily. Secondly, the general understanding pre /ailing ar; ong oho mari time Arabs is that the Hesident is the C.-ief Authority empowered to settle all their dispmtes in the Culf. Reference to the Bomba .y High Court with the contingent possibility oi 1 -h0 he^xdunt o cision being upset will tend to lower the prestige of the powers of intervention which he exercises by dispensation from Goverr- ment. The high Court is greatly disliked oy Gulf r-vrabs o- ^o- cpunt of the long delays involved in settlement of suits o.^rein, the heavy expenses entailed by the e^pioy^-nt Ox , the practical impossibility for principals to attend in person. The distance separating Bahrein and Bombay and the slowness of communication would inevitably militate against the ends of prompt justice which is the only form of the commodity which the commu nity appreciates. Great difficulty, expense and loss oi time -/culd bebe incurrod by sending witnesses and parties from Bahrein to Bombay. In fact it would very often be practically impossible to obtain lihe attendance of witnesses. Appeal to the High Court might not be so fraught with object ion were British subjects the only people involved, as the iiindue i^irms often have representatives in Bombay, but it is .jidesirable to force such procedure on Jahrein subjects and Foreigners, and were it done, the native public would undoubtedly prefer the crude and uncertain jurisdiction of the ih .ikh to our own. 7. In dealing with the section of ''^ahr .in subjects and Tri bunals' it has been no easy matter to devise articles irhich will tfhile locally workable in practice, be compatible . i /ith the exi gencies of an Order in Council. I need only say here that the articles no :i suggested are the result of much deliberation between the Politicil Agents and myself and will we believe meet requirements.

DRAFT BAHREIN ORDER IN COUNCIL. Notes on Amendments suggested by the Foreign Office. HIE majority of the aniGndments are merely verbal, and have been introduced either to sim plify the language or to adapt the phraseology to that employed in other Orders in Council under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890. Some of the definitions in Article 4 (for merly 3) have been omitted as unnecessary, the words being already defined in the interpreta tion Act. Article 8 (formerly 6j has been rearranged; sub-Article (2), which was copied from the Zanzibar Order in Council. 1906, is un necessarily elaborate for Bahrein, where jurisdic tion over foreigners is claimed by His Majesty's Government under the grant from the Sheikh, and not under arrangement with the foreign Governments concerned. Sub-Article 5 has been divided so as to relegate ships to a separate sub-Article (6), and this sub- Article has been made to apply to British subjects and foreigners only. It is scarcely reasonable to deprive the Sheikh of jurisdiction over his own subjects, except to the extent that they are within the bond fide domestic service of persons subject to the Order, and this scarcely applies to their ships. Article 10 is new, but similar provisions are to be found in the Ottoman and China Orders. Article 11 (formerly 8) was taken from the Zanzibar Order in Council, 1897, which was altered in 1903. The language in sub-Article (2) ' are hereby made applicable ' was found to be ambiguous, as it was not clear whether the enactments referred to applied automatically or required some further official act to bring them into operation. Further or future Indian enactments ^eie made applicable to Zanzibar by King s Regula tions instead of by Order of the Secretary Oj State. [168 a]As the system introduced in Zanzibar in 1903 was found to be more convenient than that of the earlier Order, similar changes have been made in the Bahrein Order. A slight alteration in Article 12 (1) has been made, and the powers of the Magistrate under the Acts scheduled to the Poreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, conferred on the District Court, i .e., the Political Agent, so as to avoid the delay consequent on a reference to the Political Kesident. In Article 12 (4) (d), the area of the groups under Part II of the Pugitive Offenders Act, 1881, has been extended so as to prevent incon venience. Article 14 (2), formerly 11, is new, and is based on a provision in the Morocco Order in Council, 1889, viz., Article 11(1). It would be exceedingly inconvenient if the Political Resident had to visit Bahrein before he could exercise any functions conferred upon him by the Order in Council, and as the Morocco provision has stood unquestioned for over twenty years and is certainly con venient, it is desirable to adopt it in Bahrein. Articles 17 and 18 (formerly 13 and 14). The language has been amended, so as to make it quite clear that Article 17 only applies to Bahrein, and that the machinery of section 7 of the Poreign Jurisdiction Act must be made use of if a sentence of imprisonment is to be carried out elsewhere. Articles 21 and 22 (formerly 18 and 19) have been made to apply only to British subjects. Orders of prohibition or deportation against Bahreinis would not be reasonable, and until British jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein has become firmly established, the deportation of foreigners would be almost certain to cause friction with foreign Powers. Purthermore, the grant of jurisdiction over foreigners from the Sheikh seems scarcely to cover such a proceeding as deportation. Article 32. A similar Article is now inserted • in all Orders prepared in the Poreign Office. Article 35 (formerly 31). The draft of this Article departed from the usual type {e.g., Article 28 of the Persia Coast and Islands Order), ran^e was not explained. The elasticity, which was apparently all that was desired, will now be given by sub-Article 5 of Article 11, and accordingly the Article has been3 brought into line with that in force on the Persian side of the Gulf. Sub-Article 2. See note on Article 14 (2). Article 3S. The Foreign Jurisdiction Admi ralty Order in Council has been applied instead of applying certain sections of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890. (See India Office letter of the 24th July, 1911.) Articles 39, 41, 42. 43. The duties prescribed by these Articles have been conferred on the District Court, as the Political E-esident can scarcely be expected to attend to matters of this kind. Article 40 has been amended, so as to bring it into line with the more modern form. The old Article 40 has been struck out as being unnecessary; the matter is covered by section 2 of the Indian Civil Procedure Code, 1908, which applies in Bahrein. Articles 51—67 have been substituted for the Articles formerly numbered 47-50, as the modern type of provision on the subject of registration of persons. The register of companies was intro duced in the Ottoman dominions by the Order in Council of 1910. Articles 75 and 76 are new. The former is taken from a similar provision which was m force in the East African Protectorates, where there were no Consular officers, and the latter was suggested by the India Office letter of the 24th July, 1911. Article 78, formerly 59, has been slightly amended, because of the amendments in Article 11 (formerly 8). The ilrticle numbered 64 in the draft has been struck out as unnecessary, there having been no previous Order in Council in Bahrein which is being replaced by this Older.CONFIDENTIAL. f ' SrS : ;9 ' nCU ''k Jmtscaa ^cr&lt;.t*ru of/kaJr, ^ t I ^ k ^67, I ots DRAPT BAHREIN ORDER IN COUNCIL, 1912.

The Bahrain Order in Council 1913 is the authoritative- document defining the various capacities in Tsrhich you and your successors will act. Art 14(1) of the Order lays down that the Political Agent at Bahrain shall be deemed to be District Magistrate and Sessions Ju^ge, and Art 55(1) that he fahall be deemed to be District Judge. Art 66 says he may exercise certain -nowers of a Justice of the Peace, and Art 68 that he shall be entitled to ac t as a Notary Public. From the wording of these Articles it would rather seem that the Political Agent is not made a District Magistrate, a District Judge, a Justice of the Peace or a Notary Public, but is given the powers of such functionaries in consequence of being Political Agent. I should say therefore that it is as Political Agent that he will do his work in all Departments and that it would be enough for him to have a stamp 'Political Agent Bahrain' for authenticating papers and a seal 'Politi cal Agency, Bahrain' for closing parcels etc. If any practi cal difficulty were ever to occur, e.g. about regognitlon a paper authenticated by the Political Agent under his nota rial powers, it would only have to be pointed out to an ob.lec- tor A. P.Trevor, C.I• E. , Bahrain.objector that under Article 68 of the Order, the Political Agent had such 'Dowers. Ivill you let me have your opinion on this view of the case? It seems to me to be the simplest and I do not at present foresee any practical difficulty from adopting it.Balirain Order in Oounoil, /3^ P.R. The P.A 1 s powers to deport are limited to British subjects. Please see P.H^ M.48 of 15th May 1912 para 5. The becretary of Stat© evidently misunderstood Sir Percy's above-quoted letter and his telegram M. 192, as he (S. of S) telegraphed to Govt of India that the class of foreigners wgainst whom the power to deport was most likely to be used would be exempt if Sir Percy^s suggestion that the words^or the subject of an Arab principality having a reciprocal ^agreement with the Shaikh of Bahrain** were inserted in the Order. As a matter of fact the ^foreigners^ho would have been exempt were practically only the people of Qatij^ whereas the people we want to be able to deioort ar-/ chiefly Persian and ffurkish subjects. The Foreign Office is apparently very nervous about friction with Foreign Powers, and the India Office considers that the Shaikh^ letter ceding 3uri 9 dlotion is Hardly suffioient to warrant our as suming tha power of deportins foreigners, and that a second letter from the Shaikh would be necessary he- fore making provision for the exercise of this power. Sir Percy considered it inexpedient to approach the Shaikh for a specific delagation of the powers/to deport. All this was two years a S o, meanwhile the numbers of Jews and Muhammadans from Baghdad and of Persian Kurds have increased, and the P.A. has fre- quently been asked by the Shaikh and the ^ of Manama to deport prostitutes and procurers and boys and their exploiters - all of whom are Turkishor Persian subjects. Some undesirables, mostly, I believe, suspected house breakers have been deported or rather put on a ship and told to disappear. When the Order comes into force this should stop. I think the Shaikh would be justified in saying that our right to jurisdiction over foreigners carries with it the diaty of protecting Bahrain from unde sirables. For the P.A. to reply that ha hadn't the right to deport foreigners and must ask the Shaikh whom we jealously prohibit from exercising any jurisdiction over foreigners to do it for him would be a confession of weakness the Shaikh could not understand. If th© Shaikh's letter to Mackenzie on which our jurisdiction over foreigners is based is strong enough to give us that jurisdiction surely there is no reason to except one form of punishment, and that one a cheap ; humane punishment thoroughly under stood and consistently practised in the Gulf. The chance of friction with Christian Powers would be avoided by Govt issuing instructions to P.R. not to sanction the deportation of subjects of such powers without a reference to the S. of S. through the Governor General. The legal authorities at home seem to dread de- portatlosi, but it might be explained to them that the deportation required ia something different to ±x the form to which they are accustomed, and that it might be limited to foreigners not possessing immo veable property in the islands. Do you not think that, in view of the fact that our jurisdiction over foreigners has in the last two years become more firmly established while the ne cessity for deportations has become stronger, the subjectli'l f subject might be taken up again. // Tners is another weak point in the Order in Council. The Code of Criminal Procedure is applied to Bahrain but for its provisions for taking security para 21 to S3 A are substituted. As regards foreigners- the P «A. can only take security on conviction - as in para 106 of the C.C.P. but no penalty is laid dorm as in para 12S of the 0«C*P. Security on separate proceedings such as is provided for in para 107 of the O.C.P. cannot be ticken from Foreigners. These tm) omissions are probably inadvertent, but they water the P.A^ powers most inconveniently ♦ If para 20 of this Odder were omitted foreigners would, as in all other^ respects / be subject to the provisions of the C .C .P. T .Keyes* 3-6-14.p.A, Bahrain . I have read your note of 5rd June regarding difficulties you foresee m carrying out the provisions of new Bahrain Order in Council. The latest die tun of Sir E. Grey is that you have only jurisdiction over foreign subjects and he seems to throw some doubt on your right to proteet them (vide Markomannla case). In the circumstances, is it such a sign of weakness not to ask Shaikh to expel them for you but to permit him to expel them? It would probably save you some trouble. He would have to ask you to do so. You might, I think, explain that the provisions of the Order in regard to deportation are exceedingly complicated and that it might be difficult to establish a case but that you are anxious to meet his wishes and if the Shaikh will ask for their expulsion, you will call the undesirables in question up, ask them to show cause why they should not be handed over to the Shaikh. You will probably find, in practice, that they have not registered themselves or something of that sort or that they are thoroughly bad characters and decline to intervene on their behalf and hand them over to the Shaikh's officials who will undertake that they shall be expelled from Bahrain# I think the ■ atter could be arranged, whereas the present deportation sections are so cumbersome that it will only be in very important cases, thoroughly discussed before nana, that it will be possible to marce use o± them. There may be a difficulty of expense but I do not think you need worry much about that. You will probably no 4 bo troubled so much by the 'unco 'guid' if they find that they have to put their hand in their P ookets ^^'perraiT'^xpuMon they should. If they won 't pay, decline to The alternative of getting the Order ih Council changed presents formidable difficulties and I dun t cure to face them. YourWf^i 'Si Your other difficulty seems to me to deoend on the ludiolal Interpretation of 'Subject to the provisions of this order' Part III section 14(1). Does that mean 'If the Order lays dovm one course of ' action, I am bound to adhere to it'?, or 'provided thsre is nothing in the provisions of this Order absolutely inconsistent with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code as regards *» taking of security, I am at libertv to either apply procedure as seemn good to me'. I find it difficult to explain my point but I can imagine a process of reasoning somewhat as follows The Order in Council lays down a course of action for me in Section 20, where a person is convioted of an offence. It is silent on what I an to do when confronted with cir- l I cumstanoes contemplated by sections 107 and 125 G.C.P, — But it has applied the O.C.P# in toto and expects me to i make use of it, unless there is something repugnant to such of its provisions as I - propose to apply in the provi sions of the Order. I find nothing,therefore I apply C.C.P. sections 107 or 123 as the case may be. [ : i The difference between my view and your? is this 'I regard G.G.P. and Order in Council as concurrent, until they can be shown to conflict, when Order in Council car ries the day'. Where order is silent, as for instance of ^ : section 21 (1 f where it is shown by evidence on oath, to H the smtisfaction of the District Court that any person stCf the Order in Council gives me no guidance: I therefore titrn | to the C.C.P. section 107 (l) and find that it does guide me and therefore apply it. This is all special pleading but i you are not likely to be worried by pleaders and, if it in convenient, I should adopt this procedure, until some one stops you. You on the other hand, contend that for the provisions of the O.C.F. for taking security paras 20-25 o Order in Council j. i t |/yo Council are substituted. I can quite understand^ counsel for the prisoner taking that view but it is an inconvenient doctrine. On what do you base it? J have agaih read over those provisions 20 to S3 and honestly think that they are supplementary and additional to C.C.P. not substitutions. 8 th June 1914*0° ''' No - Jiff of 19 15 Prom To Major . H.

Sir, I have 4 the honour to inforn you v;lth reference to 'overnment, of India letter o.l'lfH of February 2f-nd forward ed under your endoraeraent of the I'th instant, that, in my opinion, it would be inadvisable to hrinpr the Bahrain )rdor in Oounoil into effeot during the oontinuanoe of the War. The Shaikh of Bahrain and hie subjects are extremely touchy ao to their position, and reaont any innovation. Kven before the outbreak of war the merchants were much exeroined it my i^stallinflr a petition /riter, ars they believed thia to be the first etep towards more regular judicial procedure. Since the arrest of the -'er^an merchant here and of the ;rmanri in ushire, they have become still more on the alert, and would certainly stronrly resent anv iction which could be construed ass an attempt to extend our powers. ' ? ere the Order in Oounoil brought into force it would be Impossible to conceal the fact that eome chamro had taken nlace. ' r or instance under Section 3ft the Political Arent has to enquire from the noveral narties if thev desire that procee linrs nhall be in accordance with Cthe Code of Civil Procoduro or in acoordance with local usare.

Secondly I consider that, the Order in Council needs aome modifications, t ' 6 u- '. jt to which, with one exceptioj I will reserve for another letter.

British Residency and Consulate -General, Bushire, £ T May 1915, To The Political Agent, B a h r a in. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No.899 dated 29th I'arch 1915 on the subject of the introduction of the Bahrain Order in Council, which has been handed over to me 'by the Hon'ble the Resident for disposal with certain remarks. Sir Percy Cox is of opinion that, while it is not very convenient to bring the Order into effect during the continuance of the war, it is impossible to delay the application of the Order indefinately, and that most of the objections which you have raised will offer serious difficulty or require special treatment except the question of the Shaikh's Khidmah, provided that the Order is introduced gradually and quietly. He there fore wr#te^ to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India to the effect on the 19th April and you have received a copy. No doubt some points such as that about the Lajlis which you mention in paragraph 2 of your letter will require modi- to 'test fication, but it will be best/the Order for a year or perhaps twp and then put up the points requiring modification in the light of experience. I would, however, observe, en passant, that the Majlis is not exactly the same as a Council of Elders under the Frontier Crimes Regulations because / when one of hib subjects is involved in the case^the ..hai .h can (and does sometimes) decline to accept the decision of the Majlis e.g. the various claims against Ahmed Yatim at one time landing contractor. His Majesty 's Government has asked for a draft King s Regulations making whatever alterations may be necessary in the Indian Pilgrim Ships Act at Bahrain. I attach a copy of the King's Regulations in force under the Persian Coast and Island/s islands and the Masqat Order, and beg to enquire if you consider that the same Regulations can be made under the Bahrain Order in Council. It is desiratele that the Regulations under the Bahrain Order should.as far as possible^ be assimilated to those under the Persian Coast and Islands Order, as our object is to have similar rules and practice in force on both sides of the Gulf as far as possible. The Foreign Department has also asked that similar action may be taken in respect of other enactments included in the Schedule of tho Order. As, However, it has not been found necessary to make modifications in these enactments under the Persian Coast and Islands Order, it will not, I expect, be necessary to make any modifications at Bahrain, I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Officer on Special Duty. (In the absence of the Resident)P.A.Bahrain. : Referring to the order in Co^cil question. To my mind the position is this-, successive P.As have for 10 years past been exercising magisterial and judicial functions, which are not authorized by any law, and by doing so have established fairly definite customs and usages. The Order in Council is intended to put such usage, or rather as much of it as convenient, on a legal basis. It does not, however, (I take it) abolish all usages not embodied in it - and in fact Section 82 says that the P.R. or an officer subordinate to him can enforce the observance of any KSXi&amp;sHaisj reasonable custom existing in Bahrain unless this Order contains some express and sp0c- l fic provision incompatible with the observance thereof', This partcular section is not Quite so clear on the subject as similar sections in some other Orders-in-Council, but it seems to me to authorize a continuance of such establish ed custom. Paragraph 75 (3) also I think shows that a P.A. can do things not mentioned in the Order. s The result of the Order thus in my opinion is that, whereas.'hitherto every judicis®i act done by the Political Agent, except orders passed or^fc^subjects as a first class Magistrate, was illegal, aftajiks introduction of the Order quite a number will be legal. Nothing in the Order should, it seems to me, prevent a P.A. from continuing to do anything reasonable which he did before, though in case of British subjects and possi bly some Persian subjects and Basravis known to be sea lawyers, it would he advisable to exercise caution in cas^- some appeal might result in the P.A's authority being specifically entailed. ■to . , Now/turn to the points you have raised. (1). The Ma j lis-ul -Urf is described in the definition as a n Civil Court x x x x selected by the Pol-i t. cal Agent in concert with the Shaikh'. As you know this is not correct/jTV correct, as it is mora an advisory body, section 45 ( 8 ) ; • Ty should have the words 'when ratified by the Pol itical Agent, and Shaikh, if necessary' after 'Majlis-ui- Urf similar to article 44 (l)o in the case of Kaais judgments and I think words to this effect can be under stood until some one tells us not tc^by which time it may be time to propose some suggested amendments and alter- ations to the Order. (2). Security for good behaviour from foreigners. I should say that the P.A. might continue to do this under established custom, especially when the local au thorities or Kazi have brought up the foreigners as bad characters• (3). similarly in regard to the repatriation of undesir able foreigners. This is an exceedingly well established custom, not only in Bahrain but in every other part of the Persian Gulf. Every Shaikh and Local Government does it,* in the absence of a regular and efficient Police Service it is the only thing to do. Provided that no specific charge is made to Government I do not think any questions will eveqT come up unless some sea lawyer gets deported in which case Sections ^4 and 75(iii) coupled with ^the request of the local authorities' will probably meet the case. One would have to be a bit careful about repatriating British Indians, but it can be done, and I have done it m lots of cases here, and at Kuhammareh, and no questions raised. (4). Pearl cases over 5,000/-. I think except possibly in oases between two British subjects it would be quite possible to deal with those by referring to arbitraters Majlis or Salifah etc., in abort doing what you do at present. (5). Fees and Establishment etc. Government has sanctioned a post of 250-10-300 and 2525 house rent and alao an increase of 3000 to office allow ance which you will be able to spend on salaries how you like. I am applying to Government to sanction it from let July to give you a little time to fix up matters. I think the scale of fees under the Persian Coast and Islbands Order is too heavy for Bahrain? I attach a copy. Probably it would be better to introduce a scale more like the Indian scale? I think that when you ^have got the scale drawn up and the King^ Regulations issued it would not be necessary to start levying them all at once,- a beginning might be made on British subjects - (6) Shaikhs Khidmah. This will be a difficult point but now that you have got your extra Establishment and everything sanctioned, it is not so pressing. Government will not, in view of the fact that owing to the continuance of the war, the Order is I , i L * fyV • being introduced gradually, except any immediate receipts from fees. I should think t&amp;e Khidmah might be paid to the Shaikh for the present until some favourable opportunity occurs for making an arrangement. If fees similar to those levied under the Persian Coast and Islands Order can be levied it would simplify matters as they would come to a good deal more than 10$, and the shaikh oould be compensated from them without dif ficulty. Such a scale, however, is only intended for well to do merchants trading in Persia and is obviously not in tended for a large comparatively pooflT community as I ha\a found at Muhammareh.

Subsection (2) roquiro;? that each such order should be reported to the Governor 'eneral of India in Council. This hardly seems necessary for such a mild provision.

He Majlis. Tlie remark in my letter that 'The Majlis is not exactly the same as a Council of Eldsrs' was, I am afraid loosely worded. ± should have said not 'exactly similar'. I am aware that the Magistrate need not acoeDb the finding of a Majlis - ift fact I have often declined to do so myself in Zhob and Loralai.- My point is that, whereas in the case of a Coun cil of Elders the only authority who nominates the members of the Council, accepts, or declines to accept, or revises its findings is the Magistrate or Political Officer, in the case of the ^ajlis the Shaikh is in a similar position. This,to my mind is rather a fundamental difference between the two bodies though they both are advisory. However it is beside the point, as the Majlis have been consistently referred to as a Civil Court since the very first draft order in 1910, and no one has ever taken exception to it; I do not think (nor does Sir ^ercy) that we can go up for an alteration now between the time of the oificial pub - ation of the Order in the Sazette and its introduc What I should do myself would be to treat the ^ajlia exactly as it has been treated hitherto and swv 0O ^ t ' ri ation in the definition and the offending section either wnen the question comes up in a case, or m a year or are suggesting amendments in the Ixght ol ex^erl 2. Sir Percy certainly gave me to understand that it was intended to introduce the Order as gradually as posbiule. . • , fh e office notes though The word 'gradually' is mention^i not in Sir Percy's, as ha writes 'We have discussed this matter' etc. In hi. letter to Foreign Sir Percy says 'It • ^ ti ^t TMl SV0lV (Order) might be brought into operatx^-i a- possible' 01? T U rr i'H.Keyes, I,A., ^itical Agent, | E a h r a i n. • ^ j I lL f 1 ■ •* ■ t i m 11 It : I I mpossible'. This impli0 S (to my mind) gradual introduction aa if every letter of it was introduced at once and enforced forthwith it oould not be introduced 'unobtrusively'. It appears that we do not agree as to the meaning of the word '^egar* which I used in the sense of 'According to law' i .0 • so 1 ^oo^nizo ■. go ie ox laws^ such as Hoinan ? British Dutch, Islamic, etc. The Shaikh is the Ruler and principal executive and administrative authority in the island, but not -to ray mind - the source of law, the latter being the ProDhet Muhammad and the legal gentry who commented on and (raore or less) codified his orders and sayings. The Shaikh's actions against foreigners have ordinarily boen by executive order at his own sweet will tempered by the fear of a gun-boat or (in the case of foreigners from the main land) of a raid. When questions relating to foreigners are dealt with by the Political Agent the Shaikh is relieved of his fears as regards gun-boats, etc.^, and of course the P ol - tical Agent has not got them; but 1 do not think the Political Agent could therefore issue any order which the bhai-h might have issued against a foreigner from whose country oi ti-^oe he had no fear of reprisals. Still less do thin.-, tna-. ojch orders could be considered legal. As a matter of fact the sentence out of ray note which you quote was intended to refer to Briuxsh la./. British official, if dealing witn the su.ojoCu Ox - cannot take his autho- •nmont if one of power - especially a European power rity solely from the Shaikh. A Suropoa.- aov^rn . . -u -r o British Political Agent its subjects is to be tried by a - ild naturally claim that he should a the usual rights of appeal instead of by the Shaikh wou 'be tried in a legal manner and have -» • i, fVia Grovernment had pre etc. etc. in lieu of the right whicn u-' v, tr*1 al or of reducing punishment viously of ensuring a propei t-1 by its mere prestige, or by threats, or by debate... o ^ vessel etc. Incidentally I might add (although beside the point) that I think most European powers w ^ say that the Shaikh of Bahrain had no authority over the^ nationals, and there!ore co uld not delegate it to Uo. notnot think they would object in principle to our assuming ' tha right as th^ protecting power especially when it i - a 'fait accompli'. In any case it seems advisable to assume the power as quickly as possible. This question of an Order in Council has been going on for several years already ever since about 1906. In regard oO the three mattery which you say the Political Agent cannot forego (i) Prohibiting foreigners from living in Bahrain, and deporting foreigners. We know of course that it was with the greatest diffi culty that His Majesty's Government agreed to include foreign ers at all under any provisions of the Order in Council. Every effort was made to get authority to deport foreigners, vide Sir Percy Cox's letter M.48 of 15th -ay 1912, and sub sequent telegrams, but without result. I do not think there was any correspondence regarding prohibiting foreigners from residing in Bahrain, but it comes in the same category and would not have been accepted. In these circumstances we shall have to drop the question of prohibiting foreigners from living in Bahrain or ox ftfrtnally deporting them by judicial process. I do not, however, see any 'Express and specific pro vision incompatible with' your observing the old established custom of putting undesirable foreigners on a ship and re patriating them by executive order. 1 shuu-^d it if 1 were you, but if you think it is illegal you coald get the Amir to do the actual send-Lug ii. (ii) Security from foreigners witnout co.avi^tion. See my note of 5th May 1915. If a man is a bad character and the local authorities or Kazi recommend his being put on se- V/e curity I am certain that no objection woull b have always found under the Persian Coast and Islands Or. that 'The request of the local authorities , quiry to be reasonable, is sufficient reason for doin, thing of the sort by executive order . .

Of course the Order 'is brought into effect' 2nd August, and from that date the whole of it cores into force. But as far as I know there is no reason why every section of it should be enforced at once and it rests with you how much you enforce straight off. There are clauses of the Persian Coast, and Islands Order, (which has been in force since 1889) which so far as I am aware have never been enforced. Innumerable clauses in many acts and some whole acts always remain a dead letter. I am afraid the wording of my latter 8^' and note of 5th -iay 1915 was rather loose, but; 1 was not expecting dia lectical discussions: possibly this letter is not mucn oetter, if so it is due to want of practice in such matters. As regards the Assistant, if you don't think the ar^oir.t ment necessary there is no need to get a man at .:re= You could wait till after the war when case work will rrocaoly increase again.

I attach a note commenting on your note on the Bahrain Order in Council. As you see I think most of the difficulties can be avoided, for a start at any rate. ( ■ If A h'' Remarks on 'Note on the Bahrein Order in Council' by the Political Agent, Bahrein., Section 4 ^ The definition of Majlis el Urf could be amended later on,if it is found that the present one gives trouble,. The definition of Salifah Court is 'a court of one or more judges who have a knowledge of local diving and customary marine law et cetera'. It would appear that the Political Agent and Shaikh have power themselves to allocate one or more judges to diving^ and one or more to marine^ if it suits them to do so instead of each judge having to do both things* I think all that would be necessary would be that when making an order (for record) that (say) Muhammad Pazal and Kjilifah bin Muhammad had been appointed judges of the Salifah Court by the Poli tical Agent and Shaikh, an addition should be made that un til further orders Muhammad Fazal would hear the diving cases and Khalifah Kf the marine cases« Section 14 &gt; I do not think it is necessary to make an alteration. Ho trial by Jury or with assessors has ever been held unaer the Persian Coast and Islands Order and I do nou think expected. Section 20 c ! see no reason to suppose that section 107 of C.G.P (or any other section except Chapter XXX Article 11(2) of the Oraer and eluded from the Orde clia p fe er XXXIII the Schedule applies the whole ^ode „ +&gt;ie r c p or any other section (except If section 107 0 * t 11 0 teeen m ade eluded mention would have oe chapter XXXIII) were natter was gone . +i is ev ident that the matter w in the schedule, as ^ . . , cour ts Act. + &gt;1P en try re Bombay into in detail from the en ry Section 21 ■ substitute 'Person to •very desira-3 It would he vej.^/ whomwhom this order applied for 'BritlBh Bubject' , but Hl8 MaJ „ esty'B Government could not be persuaded to do It. The only thing to do I b to carry on as before; possibly after the war our position in respect of Bahrein will be a good deal firmer and then a proposal for amendments can be put up and this can be included. possibly it won't be needed as 9 /lOthB of the badmashes may have become British subjects or protege's. Section 22 „ As tor section 21. Further suggestions regarding criminal law , (a) Possibly after the Order has been in Torce a year or two some suggestions for amendment on lines proposed might be made. In the meanwhile in my opinion a good deal could be done by referring cases to a Kazi under section 14 - 2nd para. - Generally the parties are all Muflammadans and usually they can agree to. some Kazi who can effect a compromise«, Otherwise when the parties come up,before starting on the oase^ I presume there is nothing to prevent the Political Agent re ferring case to arbitrators or Majlis for conciliation in the spirit of' section 10 and if successful^ complainant could withdraw his petition . (b) , I do not think anyone will object if these rules are not adhered to absolutely to the letter. In any case which might reasonably be compounded , I should allow the parties to compound if they wish to do so, Civil. Section '5^ (i ) The District Judge in Bombay is the principal Court of original Jurisdiction in a district and hears appeals from Assistant Judges e^d subordinate Judges etc. He can apparently hear suits up to any amount , the only restriction being that from subordinate Judges in suits, the he may not hear appeals from ia f^ooo/- these must go to the High Cour , value of which exceeds ^000/ •&gt; / ... ^ value of more than 10000/ and (2) he may not transfer suits to his assistant judges* + win have full Jurisdiction. So the Political Agent will SectionSection 37 &gt; j , ^ If the 'Salifah Co.xt' is considered to comprise 2 / branches one dealing with pearling and diving matters and the other with marine customs as suggested above, this is unneoeseary The amendment might he suggested later on with the others ; in the meanwhile,as stated,the Hindus make no objection, and Is prima facie the Hindu in any particular case cannot prove his contention by any other means, presumably he will take oath ; otherwise the point will have to be decided against him. Section 44 . See above • A good deal can be done under 44 (c) , Perhaps amendment could be suggested later with others• Section 45 c Unnecessary as regards Salifah. ul Bahri, The word 'dedision' is used in Section 44 (i)(c) in reference to the Kazi's order in a case, and the same para implies that such decisions require endorsement by the Political Agent to make them valid*, For the time being it is advisable to assume that the 'decision' of the Majlis mentioned in para 45 (i)(c) is of the same nature e It seams reasonable to suppose that- its 'judgment', as mentioned in section 45 (2) , cannot be considered for all purposes the same as if it were that of the District Court' , unless it is approved by the Political Agent* If this is admitted, matters can go on as at present but there seems to be no objection to proposing the amendments suggested later on, when point has be n considered whe would affect 45 (3). This section seems likexy to cause trouble but it is not clear how it can be altered« If any mention is made of formally ratifying ohe dec of the Majlis / the question arises as to whether the Shaikh has not the right to do so too* //fl Knows Persian and Arabic. e can talk modern Persian well; Captain Hanking says he is of good family and a quiet well behaved man. This man would seem to be just the man required for the Indian assistant 's job, and would not be subject to the ob jection i mad© a. ove about tal* ing months to leam the language and people etc:.

With reference to Notification ifo.lGOS.G. dated the 2nd September 1915, the following notice under the hand of His Majesty's Secretary of Ttate for India, dated the 17th January 1916, is published for general information. Boreas by Article 79 (l) of 'The Bahrain Order in Council 1913' provision was made that the said Order should come into force on such day within six months of its publication in the 'Gazette of India' as the Governor General of India in Council night, by notification in the said 'Gazette' appoint on t^at behalf. And wheroas the said order was published in the 'Gazette of India' on the 'rd Folruary 1^15.

Sd/ A .H.G rant, Secretary to the Government of India.With referenco to the previous demi-official correspon dence regarding the postponement of the application to Bahrein of the Order in Council, I suggest that the order might come into force on the expiry of the last period of extension notified in Foreign and Political Department Ho- tification No. 252 Q. of the 24th February 19i6 # namely on the 3rd August next. 2. Judging 'by some experience of the worXing of the al most identical Order which has been in force in Mascat since January, I should say that the introduction of the Order here will not in actual praetice maice much differ -ence in the former procedure for the settlement of cases. Parties to whom the Order applies can no doubt claim to have their cases tried out under British Indian Laws, but they showed no Inclination to do so at Mascat. On the con trary, I was several times informed by leading British Merchants at Mascat, that they greatly appreciated celerity and simplicity of the existing system of procedure. Though I have no personal experience yet of the li gatlon in Banrein. there seems no obvious reason wny the attitude here should prove to be different from that of Uasoat. On the contrary, the literature on the suU shows that the people here are averse to innovat For these reasons, I thlnK It need not be an .iolpated that the gradual introduction ol the orier dur War would produce any discontent. Always prot]i0 two points which. In ray opinion, are roaliy somowhat thorny, namely, the int.oductlon of Court fees and the quea** tlon of the ShelXh's 'Ichldma', are left over till a more con venient season. In order to leave these matters in abeyance for the present, all that would be necessary, I think,would toe a demi-official assurance of the approval of the Resident 3. If Sir Percy Cox agrees that the Order might be intro duced on the i^rd August next, the question as to the appoint ment of the Judicial Assistant might, I suggest, now be set'* tied. The present situation is that Keyss was given authority to malce a selection, but this has not yet been done. Nalb Tahslldar Abdul Hamlcl of the N.W.F.P., whose name has been mentioned in this connection, is very well known to me. He had had very little judicial experience when, about two years ago, I secured him the appointment as Manager of a large Court of Wards Estate. He is not, in my opinion, quite what la required; and his ignorance of Arabic, would I thinx, greatly lessen his use fulness for a long time to come. Sayyld SadlK Hussan, formerly of Mas cat, is not personal- -ly known to me - but from what I saw of his work on tile*. I should say that he has sufficient Judicial experience for the class of worX HKely to arise in Bahrein, and no aoubt he will, with praotloe. Improve and acquire a sufficient K o&lt;v ledge of regular procedure. His acquaintance with Arabic and En^llah are strong p In his favour. He left Mascat In Benn's time, hoping to get an appol ofr ment under the Foreign Department. In this he was dls pp ed. He wrote Just before I left Mascat intimating that he was willing to rejoin there. I gave his letter to Ducat, I believe, some Idea of getting him back in place of the p sent inefficient holder of the post of mte pi eter I suggest that he might be given a trial J® 9- Re in goome at once as Interpreter, and he W oni„ ne would probably be wil ling to do ao if he might be giv«n + „ given to understand that, as soon as the order m counoii oame into force ^ j-orce, he would be given a trial as Judicial Assistant nn ssistant on one years probtion. If this suggestion is approved, i win Brlte ln tlie above sense to SadiK Hassan, I nave not got his address, i should be much obliged if you would Kindly telegraph for it to Ducat, ur. Fernandez at Basra alsoi tninx Knows it. He would. I expect, hesitate to come now on the pay of the interpreter Bahrein, via. Rs too/- p. m .. when fte oan g9t Hs. 150/- at Kascat. But if the order is to come into force from 3rd August next. I expect I could arrange to let him have 150/- till then by arrangement of the office allowance. I should be extremely glad to get him as soon as possible as the Persian who is at present officiating here as Inter preter is far from efficient; and it would be a good thing If the new Judicial Assistant had some Knowledge of local conditions oefore taking over the duties of this post.

Keyea, however, maintained that one could not introduce it without bringing force e.ery word of it straight off from the very moment of its introduction.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Resident and the Political Agent in Bahrain, each post being held by a number of different representatives throughout the period covered by the volume.The first item in the volume is a letter sent from Major Ramsay, British Consul-General in Baghdad, to Major Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 9 March 1907. The letter concerns the jurisdiction in Bahrain over American citizens based at the American Missionary, particularly in relation to births, deaths and the disposal of estates (folio 1g). This enquiry was symptomatic of raised concerns over where jurisdiction lay in relation to the increasing number of foreign nationals in Bahrain. In a letter dated 6 April 1907 the Bahrain Political Agent, Captain Francis Prideaux, wrote to Cox, outlining the judiciary requirement he believed that he, as Political Agent, should have. These included the authority of a district magistrate in criminal matters, consular authority in notarial and shipping duties, and the power of vice-admiralty (folios 3-8).Application was consequently made for an Order in Council in Bahrain, via Cox, in his capacity as Political Resident, to the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India, and the Foreign Secretary. In May 1909, John Morley, the Secretary of State for India, wrote to the Governor General of India, stating that, in light of increasing German activity in the Gulf, the Political Agent in Bahrain was authorised to approach the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah, with a view to him ceding responsibility for foreign nationals in his dominions to the British Government (folios 50-52). This responsibility was duly granted to the British (folios 63-64), though not, according to Captain Charles Mackenzie, then Political Agent in Bahrain, without some reluctance on the part of Shaikh ‘Īsá (folios 65-66).Subsequent correspondence deals with some of the finer points of the wording of the Order in Council, with particular attention being paid by officials to the status of foreign nationals in Bahrain, including their registration with the Political Agency, and the legal ability to deport them if necessary. A draft copy of the Order in Council, dated, 1912, is included in the volume (folios 100-112). The unrest and disruption caused by the First World War in the Gulf, repeatedly delayed the introduction of the Order in Council. On 7 May 1917 the Political Agent Captain Percy Loch wrote to the Political Resident, Major Arthur Trevor, suggesting that, in view of recent developments in the conflict in Europe, and the entry into the war of the United States of America, the present time might be a prudent one to implement the Order in Council. In his letter Loch described how Turkish withdrawal from the Gulf, the independence of Bin Saud [Ibn Sa‘ūd], and formal British relations with the Shaikh of Qatar, would impact upon the treatment of certain foreign nationals in Bahrain (folios 232-35). Trevor rejected Loch’s proposal, and in May 1918, the introduction of the Order in Council in Bahrain was postponed once more, until February 1919 (folio 248).Amongst the discussions over Bahrain’s Order in Council, the appointment of a judicial assistant for the Political Agency was discussed (folios 189-94, 243-44, 249-51), as was the existing
                           khidmahsystem of revenue collection (a ten per cent judicial fee payable to the Sheikh of Bahrain's treasury). A Statement of
                           khidmahfor the years 1912 to 1916 is included on folio 227.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Bahrain Order in Council (1913)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002e5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
