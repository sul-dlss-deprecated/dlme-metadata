As well as the details of these specific proposals, the correspondence also discusses relations between Iraq and Kuwait, and Britain's position in both countries.The majority of the correspondence is between British officials but the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence between the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah and the Political Agency in Kuwait (in Arabic with English translations).The file also contains a record of a conversation between Foreign Office officials and the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs during a meeting held at the Foreign Office in London on 4 October 1938 (folios 54-56).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Umm Kasr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Harbours</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000cb#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000cb#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000cb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
