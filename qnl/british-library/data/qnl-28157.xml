T . r . 7^ v I am not particularly happy about the proposal contained in Hr.Duke*s telegram below. In the first place I thinic it is a doubtful propriety that our official time and that of the Board of Trade should be taken up with producing information to enable ilr.Sinkin to produce an essay (no doubt for the Research G-roup and, therefore unofficial) on the subject of ccmmercial regulation! imposing restrictions on British interests in countries that have passed from a state of subservience to sovereignty. Secondly the suggestion that Hr #Zinkin should be put in touch with Hr .Hall-Patch, who is an Assistant Under Secretary of State in charge of the Econcmic Relations Deparbnent of the Foreign Office, seems to me to show lack of appreciation of the importance of either idr.Hall- Patch or Mr.Zinkin. The most that we should do for the latter I suggest is to put him in touch with Hr .Parker who is, I believe, a principal in the Board of Trade. If you agree I will act accordingly.

Any reply to this communication should quote the following reference J- C.R.T. 959/45 Dear Cleary, ^ I ii-C. C You asked me to amplify the provisional reply which I sent you on 8th March to your letter of 2nd March, We are still in some difficulty in dealing with this matter because of our uncertainty about the precise intentions of the writer of the Government of India letter. I must ask you therefore to treat this reply as an attempt to provide a basis for the elucidation of the request from India rather than as a reply to it. In the past it has, of course, unfortunately been true that independent parts of the Empire as well as foreign countries, have used protective restrictions to support their new industries but we have not had reason to complain that Egypt and Iraq have discriminated,specifically against the commerce of this country as distinct from the generality of foreign countries. We should, of course, resist energetically any attempt to treat the commerce of this country less favour ably than that of any other foreign country. But in the case of Egypt there has been legislation, actual and attempted, designed to promote Egyptian interests at the expense of all foreigners, e.g. attempts to secure effective Egyptian control of companies registered in Egypt etc., etc. 23^ In the case of China, you are probably already aware that we shall probably shortly be negotiating a Commercial Treaty, one of the main objects of which will be - as far as we are concerned - to ensure that China does not discriminate against our nationals or commerce. • D. M. Cleary Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.In the case of Eire, although it is true that protective restrictions have been introduced which have affected the trade of this country, they were not directed specifically against this country (except for a short period in consequence of political differences connected with the Irish Land Annuities question), and we have some reason to hope that Eire will not in the future pursue a policy of protective restrictions which would, in effect, impede the trade of this country. It is to be noted that in the Eire Trade Agreement of 1938 Eire undertook that protective duties and other import restrictions should be reviewed by a Prices Commission in accordance with the principle that such duties and restrictions should be replaced by duties not exceeding such a level as would give United Kingdom producers and manufacturers full opportunity of reasonable competition while affording Eire industries adequate protection having regard to the relative cost of economical and efficient production. United Kingdom producers and manufacturers have full rights of audience before the Prices Commission, « wmKmmsmmmammmnm(h^ !} Bring up again onTelephone No.: Whitehall 5140.

March in which you enclosed^request for information about comaercial regulations and restrictions which have operated against British and foreign business interests in countries whict^have passed from a dependent to a Sovereign status. I am afraid that we are not entirely clear from the enclosure to your letter what kind of information is required. I fear that we could hardly produce any useful material on the request as it now stands. I wonder if you would find it possible to ascertain exactly what the writer of the Government of India letter has in mind? We would then do our best to assemble the necessary material or comnent in general terms. D. M. Cleary E s q., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. Yours sincerely, \t3. K n March, 1945.
