Finsbury Circuit, 9th Tune, 19 ^ 9 « •J. B. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, P.W.l. Dear Gibson, The question of medical snd hospital facilities for European and American staff of the Company in Kuwait has lately been under consider tion. We rely, at present, upon the American Mission but their objects do not, of course, comprise the supply of such facilities as we shall presumably need^in the near future, if the numbers of staff in Kuwait continue to increase. It is probable, therefore, that in about tvo years* time we shall have to construct our own hospital together with doctor*s and nurses* quarters at some suitable place near Kuwait town. At present, however, the minimum which could be done in this way would be considerably in excess of our needs, so that the medical staff whom we would have to engage would, to a large extent, be unoccupied. Our General Superintendent in Kuwait has discussed the matter with Dr. Mylrea of the American Mission and it has been suggested that we should temporarily convert a convenient house, which we already rent, into a hospital for our employees. The Mission would continue to provide medical services and, in order to handle the extra work, it is proposed that another nurs- 1 should be engageo in the United States for service in Kuwait. The nur c e would give us whole-time duty whenever required but would otherwise be available for work in the Mission*s Women*s HospitalJ. B. Gibson, Esq., 9th June, 1939* We hope to proceed on these lines and to arrange for the nurse to arrive in Kuwait at the end of September. I find it difficult to decide whether she will be an employee of the Mission or of the Company. In either case, the Company will no doubt approach H.M.Government for permission for the nur 'e to go to Kuwait and for a passport visa. Would you v indly let me know if, in the circumstances, the India Office would facilitate our obtaining these in either of the Possible conditions of employmant.

The issue arose because the Company had up until that point been dependent for medical and hospital facilities on the American Mission in Kuwait, but this arrangement was deemed to be unsuitable in view of the prospective increase in the Company's staff.The papers show that the India Office and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf concurred in the proposal to recruit an extra nurse.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
