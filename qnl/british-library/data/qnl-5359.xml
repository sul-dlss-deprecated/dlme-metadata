Crimina.1 Jurisdiction . 2. The State Courts may not try a European British subject who commits an offence in the Kalat, Las Bela or Kharan State. The trial of such offence, if it is of a nature rendering it legally and appropriately triable by a Magistrate, will be held by a British Justice of the Peace in the St ate ? while if the offence is such as to render committal to a superior court necessary or appropriate ? the committal v/ill be to the Lahore High Court where the trial will be held. The Political Agent, Kalat, and the Assistant Political Agent, Kalat, are Justices of the Peace for all the three States and the Assistant for Mekran to the Political Agent, Kalat, is a Justice of the Peace for the Kalat State only. 3. in like manner, the State Courts may not try a foreign European or American who commits an offence in one of the States. The trial of such offence will be held by the Assistant Political Agent, Kalat, or the Assistant for Mekran exercising the powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure of a Magistrate of the First Class, with power to try all offences not punishable with death, or by the Political Agent, Kalat, exercising the pov/ers under the Code of a District Magistrate or a Court of Session and an appeal will li*e to the Political Agent, Kalat, or the Judicial Commis sioner in Baluchistan, as the case may be. 4. The question whether Lhe trial of a foreigner, not being a European or American, for an offence in any of the three States should be held by a State Court or by an Agency Court in accordance with paragraph 3 v/ill be referred to the Political Agent, Kalat, or the Assistant Political Agent, Kalat, or the Assistant for Mekran and will be decided by them in conformity with any general or special directions of the Crown Representative. 5. Without prejudice to the application of paragraph 2, 3 or 4, as the case may be, in the case of an offence committed by a person within the relevant category who is also a servant of the Crown, the State Courts will ordinarily be allowed-to try a servant of the Crown, whether or not HxQ a British subject, for an offence in the State which - (a) in the case of a person subject to the Indian Army ^ct, 1911, thf lndian Air Force Act, 1932, or the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act, 1934, is committed while the offender is on leave, and (b) in the case of any other servant of the Crown - (i) is committed when the offender is on leave or absent from duty, or (ii) if committed when the offender is on duty, is not connected with the offender’s duty ana is not of a serious character. But the State will inform the Political Agent of its intention that/r m* - 2 - ^ ^ * that such offence should be tried in a State Court and vdll report the result of the trial to him, and the accused will have a right of representation to the Political Agent, who will be competent to intervene in special circumstances. The trial of an offence which does not fall within the categories in which juris liction is ordinarily left to the State Courts, or which, while falling within those categories, is made the subject of special interven- ^ tion, will be held in an Agency Court in accordance with paragraph 3. 6. Indian British subjects, not being servants of the Crown, will ordinarily be triea by the State Courts for an offence committed in the State. But it will be open to the Political Agent, whether on reference from the State or otherwise, to direct the offender to be tried by an Agency Court in accordance with paragraph 3. 7. For the purpose of the application of the foregoing paragraphs to British subjects and servants of the Crown it is immaterial whether the offence committed in the State is or is not an offence for which the offender could be tried in British India if found therein by virtue of a substantive provision of British Indian law in the sense of section 4 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 188 of the Code of Criminal procedure. The only distinguishing feature of such offence is that if the ^ offender is subsequently found in British India, he can, (if the political Agenx, for the State in which the offence was commited certifies that the offence ought to be inquired into in British India but not otherwise,) be tried by any British Indian Court which woulcliave had jurisdiction if the offence had been^committed in the place in which the offender is found. If the Political^ Agent withholds such certificate, the offender will be tried, if at all, in accordance with the preceding paragraphs after extradi tion to the State in which the offence was committed.POLITICAL DEPARTMENT NOTIFICATION New Delhi, the 22nd October 1941 No. 329-1.

Colonel Abraham of the Burmah Oil Company came and saw me the other day to tell me that his Company had decided not to interest themselves further in the Gwadur Concession. He has now written in formally to that effect. This is of course not unexpected, and from our point of view is no doubt a good thing now that Indian Oil Concessions have obtained the concession for the adjacent Kalat territory. The Company’s decision to grant the Sultan of Muscat the amount of the ’salaami* which they would have paid him had the deal been completed seems extremely generous, and I should imagine the Sultan will be very pleased. I see no reason why it should embarrass the Government of India unless they might think that it will establish a bad precedent, but in any case the matter seems entirely one between the Company and the Sultan.

It is an appeal by the Government of India against the judgment of the Additional Judicial Commissioner for Baluchistan as to the title of Jamalis to lands in Niabut and Nasirabad, both of which are districts ceded to the British Government in 1903. The question at issue seems to be what is the effect of the treaty of 1903 between His Highness the Khan of Kalat and the British Government. The Additional Judicial Commissioner found that it was in essence nothing but a lease and he found accordingly that the title was with the Respondents. It is not expected that the appeal will be heard before the Privy Council until some time next year. ainoMwiy- (8gd.) r. peel:R.T.Peel. Esq. .I.:.

The Khan claims that the lease does not cover mineral rights.

Dear Sirs, yvc enclose for your information a comprehensive note prepared by Messrs. Orr Dignam &amp; Co., which deals on general lines with questions raised as to the criminal jurisdication of Indian States and in particular to the States of Malat and Las Bela. You will see from the note that they do not advocate the inclusion of any additional clause dealing with this subject in either the Kalat or Las Bela licence. This follows your own ideas as expressed in your cable and letter of 30th June to Karachi and we do not intend to proceed further with the matter other then to advis^ the Jazir of Las Bela, which we must do in view of his broaching the matter, that our Attorneys have advised that we cannot properly include such a clause in our agreement. we believe, and to this our Attorneys agree, that we might advantageously take up this matter of criminal jurisdiction verbally with the Political Agent, Kalat, at an opportune time, and he might possibly take it upon himself to enquire from the Political Department how cases involving nationals other than those of Las Bela and Kalat states might be handled. In this way we will not appear in the matter in any way, as we believe you will agree that to cio so might be misunderstood and considered presumptuous on our part.in the absence o± any luture agreement the courts (ii any) o± the State in which a crime was committed would have jurisaition, and intervention by a national’s own consular or governmental authorities would be justified only in case he was subjected to trial according to uncivilized or inhuman standards, /Ve are in receipt of a letter dated 6th July from Karachi advising us that the Wazir of Las Bela will be away for about a week and that they are proceeding with the typing of a new Las Bela draft which will include (1) a ten-year prospecting licence, and (2) a 60-year lease, ana that on the Nazir’s return, they will take up these changes in the prospecting licence with him. The corrections mentioned in your letter LK-95 have no doubt been notea, and on page 39, clause 4, they propose to insert the word ''serious” between the words 'any” and 'accidents”. we are in receipt of your letter LC-108 and shall again take up the matter of a thirty-year lease with an option to extend it for a further thirty years, should we be unsuccessful in coming to an agreement for a sixty years’ term.

Copies (with enclosures) to;- H.R.B. M.E.L. Refer to:- Las Bela our F-135 we have no comments, California standard oil cqicpant, limited.The following queries have 'been raised (a) How complete is the jurisdiction of an Indian State over British, British Indian and American Subjects respectively ? (b) Whether British Indian Courts can have any jurisdiction with regard to offences which take place in Native States ? (c) Whether it would be practicable for any agreement to be made with the State by which offences on the part of British, British Indian or American Subjects should be referred to the jurisdiction of British Indian Courts ? In every case, whether a State has concluded treaties with the British Government or has received a Sanad from them, the legal position of the State must necessarily depend on the terms and contents of the document in question. Corresponding to the variation in internal sovereignty there are different gradations of jurisdictional authority possessed and exercised by the Indian States. In general the States may be classified into four groups according to the measure or degree of the jurisdictional authority .- (l) Pull powered States which enjoy and exercise plenary jurisdiction over all persons and in respect of all offences committed v/ithin their territories; e.g. the Rajput States whose treaties contain the provision that the Rulers shall be the absolute masters of their countries and that British jurisdiction shall not be introduced into these principalities.2. vw States whose jurisdictional authority is restricted in respect of persons, e.g. (a) criminal jurisdiction of second class Kathiawar States in respect of capital sentence was limited to their subjects only. (h) Under the existing arrangement the State of Kashmir aoes not exercise any criminal jurisdiction over European British subjects, Americans, Europeans and British Indian subjects oi His Majesty (such as Indian subjects merely visiting the territories of the State of Kashmir or acting as servants of European subjects). ( 3 ) States whose jurisdictional authority is restricted in respect of offences, e.g. one of the conditions agreed to by the Jam of Las Bela relative to the administration of the State was that before causing sentence of death to be executed he shouldcbtain the sanction of the -agent to the Governor General. (4) States whose jurisdictional authority is restricted both in respect of persons and of offences, e.g. the Behar and Orissa States are competent to try all criminal cases occurring within their territories, except (1) those in which Europeans are concerned, and (2) heinous offences, such as murder and robbery. Tae ^overnmexit of India, however, have always maintained their right to exercise jurisdiction over Europeans and European British subjects and have always insisted that the right was the prerogative of the paramount power. This right has always been resisted by the States. It has never been denied by the Government of India that the State enjoys in the absence of any agreement to the contrary full jurisdiction over Indian British subjects.The Kalat State, unlike other Indian States, is really a confederacy of partially independent chiefs whose head is the Khan of Kalat. The relations of Kalat with the British Government are governed by the treaties of 1854 and 1876 by the latter of which the independence of Kalat was recognised, while the Khan agreed to act in subordinate co-operation with the British Government. The Khan is assisted in the administration of the State by a v/azir-i-Azam whilst the Governor General’s Agent in Baluchistan conducts the relations between the Government of India and the Khan, and exercises general political supervision over the State. Subject to the foregoing there is believed to be no limit on the powers of the State. kules regarding disposal of criminal cases in the Kalat State are, it is believed dependant on custom rather than on any definite code and the custom varies according to the tribe, race and religion of the offender. The difficulties with regard to the jurisdiction to which British subjects might be subject were felt by the Government of India when they were constructing the Mushkaf- Bolan Railway in 1894 and the following agreement was entered into by the Khan of Kalat. 'In o^er to meet the wishes of Government I hereby grant, on behalf of myself and my successors, to the British Government the right to occupy and administer and to exercise full civil and criminal jurisdiction over the lands of my (Kalat) State occupied and traversed or hereafter to be occupied or traversed by the Mushkaf- Bolaa Railway to the extent of 100 ft.on each side, and the lands required for railway stations and other buildings to the extent of a quarter of a mile on eachside; for so long as the said lands and premises shall he required for railway purposes'. Similarly in 1903 the Khan ceded 'to the British Government full and exclusive power and jurisdiction of every kind over the lands in the said State which are or may hereafter he 9 occupied hy the Nushki Railway (including all lands occupied for stations ? for out-huildings and for other railway purposes), and over all persons and things whatsoever within the said lands'. Possibly the Khan might he persuaded to enter into a similar agreement with regard to jurisdiction over the lands to he occupied hy any Licensee or Lessee and over all persons within the said lands. Prom a practical point of view however it is considered that it would he unlikely that the Khan would in fact he prepared to enter into such an agreement in a case where the lands are occupied and used hy a private concern and not as in the case of a Railway hy the Government of India. Alternatively it might he possible for the Agent to the Governor General to persuade the Khan to introduce provisions analogous to that of the Indian Penal Code for those persons within his State who are not his subjects. A special court or Courts could then he set up when necessary. Las Bela is a comparatively small State whose administrative control is exercised hy the Agent to the Governor General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan through the Political Agent, Kalat. The Jam of Las Bela also employs a Wazir to assist him in the administration of the State. In Las Bela criminal matters are, it is understood, dealt with as in the case of Kalat in accordance with tribal, racial or religious custom. One of the conditions agreed to hy the ruler when entrusted with powers to administer the State was that he would always conduct the administration of the State inm 5 .(g) accordance with the advice of the Agent to the Governor General. Presumably therefore there would be no difficulty in procuring the assistance of the Agent to ensure satisfactoiy provisions being made for persons who are not subject of the State in criminal matters. It is not considered that any provisions could advantageously be incorporated either in the Kalat License or m the Las Bela License and it is recommended that the whole question should be taken up separately when a suitable opportunity occurs. Having regard to the foregoing it now only remains to deal specifically with query (b) above. Under Section 177 Ox the Indian Criminal Procedure Code every offence must ordinarily he enquired into and tried 'by a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction it was committed. A private agreement between the parties to confer jurisdiction on a Court which it would not have but for the agreement is void. broadly speaking crime is ’'local 1 ', the jurisdiction over the crime belonging to the country where the crime is I committe^a. Therefore, nritish Indian Courts have ordinarily no jurisdiction to try offences committed and completed outside the British territory. oection 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code gives i jurisdiction to the British Indian Courts over offences committed by subjects of the Crown in places outside British I I India only when the offender is found within British India. Under Section 3 of the Indian High Courts Act the Governor General in Council can by order authorise and empower any High Court to exercise all or any portion of the Jurisdiction and powers, conferred or to be conferred on it by His majesty’s Letters Patent, in respect of Christian subjects of His wlajesty resident within the dominions ofV.

Gibson Esq.., India Office, Whitehall, London, S.W.l.tract from letter K—252 (on Las Bela file) 20th June, 1939. Messrs. Indian Oil Concessions Ltd., 3, Clive Row, CALCUTTA. Dear Sirs, Las Bela Draft Docu ment . V;e enclose A very interesting point was raised by the Wazir which referred to the procedure to be adopted in the event of any trouble, breaking out, or offences being committed by any of our European or Indian Staff within the State. There are no Courts of Justice in the State but offences are dealt with by v/hat the Wazir described as 'Custom.’ 1 He said that the penalties for crimes were very much less severe than in British India, for instance if one man commits murder the family of the murdered man can settle the dispute by the receipt of 'blood money.' The Wazir suggested that it would be satisfactory to him if there was included in the document, both in the Licence and in the form of Lease, a Clause saying that in the event of any such trouble between two subjects of Las Bela State the dispute should be settled by 'Custom', but that if any European, or American, or British Indian subject were involved the dispute should be settled by the Yv'azir or an Officer appointed by him in that behalf who would pass orders, which orders, however, would be subject to confirmation or otherwise by the Political Agent.

Prom the penultimate paragraph of your letter, Indian Oil Concessions themselves are apparently not altogether happy about the Sultan of Muscat T s attitude. 4. Apart from Kalat and Gwadur, the Burmah Oil Company are alsq I understand, interested in that part of the Mekran coast which comes under the sovereignity of Las Bela. The Company have in fact told us privately that they have applied for certain specifically defined areas in the Las Bela Mekran, which they have selected as the result of much careful geological work. We believe also that Indian Oil Concessions have put in a 'blanket” application for the whole of this area in the hope of embracing within it the particular areas in v/hich the Burmah Oil Company are interested. 5. We would like to suggest, therefore, for the consideration of your Department that, if the Burmah Oil Company forego their claims to Gv/adur (and thus make the path of Indian Oil Concessions easier as regards securing a concession in Gwadur and the use of Gv/adur as a port for the shipment of oil from Kalat), the Government of India might be requested to support the Burmah Oil Company's applications in the Las Bela coastalmam -3- O O / ry I presume that the Government of l|ndt6 Gbfeld^prfefer @ area to have a portion of the Baluchistan dev( Burmah Oil Company rather than that this Targ^^ygy arfiould he entirely controlled by a Company which is apparently going to be financed by foreign capital. 6.

ZJ9935/38 to Starling, about the Gwadur Oil Concession, with a view to making more clear the Admiralty^ attitude towards the grant of this concession to Indian Oil Concessions or the Burmah Oil Company. 2. As the basis of a consideration of this question we accept (1) that Indian Oil Concessions are prepared to outbid substantially the Burmah Oil Company, (2) that Indian Oil Concessions have obtained a concession over Kalat. If either or both of these assumptions proved incorrect, it might be necessary to modify our view. 3. We have previously expressed a preference for the Burmah Oil Company on grounds of nationality. In view, however, of the two new factors mentioned above, we would be prepared to withdraw our preference and leave the Sheikh a free hand, provided that (1) suitable provisions are made for ensuring that Indian Oil Concessions retains its nominal British registry, and continues to satisfy the requirements which we gather are laid down under present Indian o - 1 S r CD 1 m o (A* O i l- I t v-t/c law for the maintenance of 50% British share capital, (2) Indian Oil Concessions enters into a Political Agreement on the Debai model, with a pre-emption ^ agreement to the Admiralty*s satisfaction, (3) if it proves practicable, the Company enters into refinery agreement, which might take account also of/ J.P.

If these requirements can be satisfied, we are inclined to think that the advantage of having the British company in would be offset by the disadvantages of the reduction involved SsJ 14’***+ %, to the revenues and the existence of competing companies in the neighbouring territories of G-wadur and Kalat. The last-mentioned factor would be of so/ne importance if it is true that oil from Kalat would have to be shipped through Gwadur. Economy and efficiency would in that case be best served if one company operated both territories, and there would thus be more chance of our getting a refinery. 4. With reference to India Office letter of 24th December, P.Z.8346/38 forwarding the draft of the Indian Oil Concessions agreement, we would suggest that consideration might be given to inserting in Article 21 specific provision for the maintenance of the 50% British interest in accordance with the suggestion in my letter of the 27th June, 1938. 5. We assume that in Article 1, line 18, words such as 'shall not include' have been omitted after 'Company^ operation'. Also Subsection (g) of Article 7 might commence with the words 'Except as provided in Article 1'. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Eyres (Foreign Office) and Starling (Petroleum Department).

Dear GiDson, Your letter P.Z.8035/38 of 19th December about oil concessions in Gwadur. Since you wrote that letter you have sent us (with India Office printed letter P.Z.8346/38 of 24th December) a copy of a letter from Watts dated 29th November. The first point I would like to make is with regard to some apparent discrepancies in the financial terms actually proposed by the Burma Oil Company for the concession and those reported to Watts by the Sultan as having been offered by them. I enclose a table comparing the various offers as actually made and as reported by the Sultan. The important point is that the Sultan’s version of the B.O.C. terms ((4) of table) is appreciably less favourable than their terms embodied in the draft Agreement sent by the Company to you on 16th September last which they stated had been submitted to the Sultan (P.Z.6467/58 and (3) of table). I assume that a copy of this draft agreement was sent to Fowle, .—/The draft Agreement with J. P. Gibson, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. £EGd, POL. b.

It rather looks as if the Sultan is actually using the terns of the B.O.C. offer to push up the I.O.C. offer, and the former Company may, therefore, not be getting a fair run even from the purely commercial point of view. We feel that this matter ought to be looked into at once by your people on the spot, in so far as it is within their power to do so. On the more general question we do not think that any , particular disadvantage ?/ould be likely to arise from the X fact that, if I.O.C. get the Kalat concession and B.O.C. get K- iwvJtN Gwadur, there will be two companies operating in adjoining 7 t territory. On this point and the more general issue of British versus foreign concessionaires, we myo inolMiod to agree with Fowle*s view, quoted in paragraph 3 of your letter of 19th December, that any disadvantage that might arise I from the operation of rival companies in Gwadur and Kalat would be more than off-set by the fact of a British Company obtaining the Gwadur concession. A- 3 - 6 '&gt; Our view, therefore, is that (1) steps should he taken to ascertain whether, to speak bluntly, the Sultan is giving the B.O.C. a fair show and (2) that he should he told that would prefer the concession to go to B.O.C.

Gp.685 Would you refer to para.4 of Watts’ letter of the 29th Novanber forwarded with your printed letter No.595S of the 10th December regarding the negotiations for an oil concession in Gwadur. The Sultan’s statement that the highest offers which he has so far received from the Burma Shell Company *?re Hs. 50,000 on execution of the Agreement, Rs.l5Q0 per mensem during the currency of the Agreement, and Rs.150,000 on taking up the concession seems most surprising in view of the terms of the draft Agreement which the Burma Oil Company sent to us on the 15th September 1938 and which they said had been submitted to the Sultan. A copy of this Agreement was sent to you on the 22nd November. In Articles 2, 5 and 7 of that draft the relevant figures are given as Rs.75,000, Rs.2,500 and Rs.150,000 respectively. Unless, therefore, which does not seem likely or they would have told us, the Burma Oil Company have gone back on their offer, the Sultan would appear to have been guilty of misrepresenting the position, possibly with a view to justifying his preference for Indiantfil Concessions to which Watts refers in para.5 of his letter. We should be &lt;^lad if you would look into the point and let us know the explanation of the apparent discrepancy, together with any comments you may have to offer.

C/783 of 14th October 1938. At an interview I bad witb the Suitan yesterday be informed me, of hie own accord, that be bad in the last week of October resumed negotiations witb Indian Concessions .Limited. He mentioned that he had recently received a letter from Mr. Me Cullocb from Karachi offering certain terms for the Gwadur concession and suggesting that he be permitted to come to Muscat to discuss rntters personally. The Sultan went on to say that he had replied to Mr. Ma Culloch* s letter making certain suggested amendments to the terms offered and adding that he preferred to wait and see what reply the Company would make to his letter in order that he could consider the situation, before Mr. Me CUdch came to Muscat to talk over the negotiations. ihe sultan did iiOt volunteer any information regarding the letails of the letter# exchanged between him and Mr. Me Cluch, so of course I did not enquire about them. 3.

As you are aware there are xn Muscat only two real problemst one the Oman aih the other fxnaiic?. If the latter con be put on a really prosperous footing the Sultan believes that he can settle the former * the great ambition of hie life (vide paragraph 5 of my letter ixo.

As you are aware his Highness, where his own interests are not very adversely effected, is generally quite ready tc comply with any parti cular desire of His Majesty’s Government and I thime that if he was aware of th/f)^. wish in this matter he would eventually grant tne concession to hurmah Shell provided their terms approximated closely to those of Indian Concessions. 5.

Subject:- G-wadur boundary. Reference correspondence ending with my lemorandum No. 2268, dated the 10th instant. 2. Your Express letter No. 4888 dated the 26th September 1938 shows that the position at Gwadur is at present in a state of such confusion as to recgiire clarifying to enable a correct conclusion to be arrived at. The actual facts as can be gleaned from the different versions and correspondence, printed and otherwise, lead one to believe that Gwadur port and its hinterland formed part of the territory which was undeniably included in the borders of the Kalat State and that the income of t ie port of Gwadur was allowed by the then Khan of Kalat to be enjoyed for his maintenance by a relative of the then Sultan of Muscat, who had left Muscat and come to the court of Kalat as a refugee about the end of the eighteenth century. The practice of the Khans of Kalat has been, and still is, to grant a sanad to the person on whom they bestowed grants of land or ^agir showing pretty well the area thus bestowed with a clear indication of the boundaries of such area. This being the case, the Sanad of the then Khan of Kalat conferring the enjoyment of the income of Gwadur to the refugee relative of the Sultan of Muscat must be in possession of the present Sultan and can no doubt oe produced by him. This Sanad will not only show the extent of the Kalat territory given as a jagir to the Muscat refugee for his subsistence, but will also show that the concession was given in the same manner as such concessions were granted, and are even now granted, by the/2 the rulers of Kalat to their subordinate Sardars and other personages. The grant of such concessions did not&gt; and does not, ire an that the Khans relinquished their suzerain powers and rights over the areas, but that on the other hand it akvays meant that the Khan retained, as they do even now, their suzerainty over them and thus possessed the powers of either allowing, at their discretion, the continuance or discontinuance of the concession. This will show that Gwadur is a Jagir granted by the Khan of Kalat to a refugee of standing from Muscat and is held by Muscat in the same manner as the other jagirs are held by the Kalat Sardars etc. This fact leads to the corollary that at present the question regarding Gwadur is not one between an independent foreign pov/er and the Kalat State, but that it is, without any doubt, one between a principal and his concessionaire, and is a purely domestic affair between the Khan and his jagirdars, be he a Kalat Sardar or any other personage from outside the State. As such, it should as a rule be dealt with by the two parties chiefly concerned and the question of the intervention of the British Government or the Government of India in the case of a dispute does not arise. The question at present under consideration merely relates to the demarcation of the boundary of the concession granted by the Khan of Kalat to the Muscat refugee as a Jagir and does not at all concern either the proprietary rights or the suzerainty of the Kalat State over Gwadur. The Muscat refugee was, as already stated above, allowed to enjoy the income of Gwadur, which was a small place at that time, and the produce of the surface of the land which v/as attached to the Port. Kalat being the suzerain power in respect of Gwadur, was and is, like other suzerain pov/ers, fully entitled to the proprietorship, possession and disposal of all/all mines, rivers, hills and forests in the concession and has every right to exercise this prerogative in any manner and at any time they like. It would thus appear that .'uscat has no right whatever to enter into negotiations with any body for the exploitation of oil or other minerals in the G-wadur area without the knowledge and express permission of the Khan, who still holds absolute and complete suzerainty over the place, which for purposes of Civil and revenue administration is a part of the territory of the Khan, although administered by a Jagirdar. His Highness the Khan feels very keenly on this question and entertains strong hopes that this aspect of the matter will be brought to the notice of the Government of India and the British Government and that it will receive their full and sympathetic consideration. 3. It may also be mentioned that, as you are av/are, the present question of the fixation of boundary is not one affecting the Kalat Durbar only as the Gitchkis of the Kech Valley, which is coterminous with the Gwadur concession, hold revenue interests in the area outside the concession, any alteration or amendment of the Gwadur boundaries as laid down in the Sanad granted by the Khan of Kalat, which are still very well known to most of the local inhabitants of Kech, will naturally affect the Gitchkis as well and are likely to create troublesome complications.Confidential.

I liad a long talk with the Wazir-i-Azam a few days ago about the Kalat-Gwadur boundary question. He gave me to under stand that while the Kalat State recognise that the Sultan of Muscat has established his right of occupation in Gwadur and cannot now be turned out, they are still deoermined to deny that he has any sovereign rights there. They hold that his authority at G-wadur extends only to surface administration and the right of collecting revenue, and that he has no sovereign rights over the territory. From -ohis it follows, in their view, (1) that the demarcation of the boundary is not in fact an inter national question of an agreement between Kalat and a foreign State, but is more in the nature of a domestic affair of the Kalat State for the demarcation of a particular area of State territory which has been granted by His Highness the Khan to the hultcui of Muscat for enjoyment of the surface revenue - and (2) tiiat all sovereign rights and rights of sub-surface revenues in Gwadur still vest in the Khan of Kalat, and that th Cultan of Muscat lias therefore no right or authority to grant any concession for prospecting or mining for oil in Gwadur. 3. The Wazir-i-Azam made it clear that the State are determin ud to go to great lengths in order to establish and maintain this position; and I did not therefore think it right to try to dissuade him. I shall doubtless hear from hia officially in due course; but I scarcely expect to do so before the beginning of December, as Mgh His Highness the Khan is absent© 2 on a protracted tour of Jhalawari and IJekran and is unlikely to ^;ive his approval to tmy coinriunication before he returns.

May I please request here that when Your Highness is ready to grant the concession, we should be informed so that we may send a representative to Muscat to conclude the final negotiations? 3# I informed your Highness that our Directors xk had agreed that if and when Your Highness is ready finally to grant us the concession, the offer made in our London Office’s letter of 28th April 1938 should be increased in two respects. First on the signing of the Agreement the Company will pay to Your Highness the sum of Rs.75,000/- (seventy five thousand rupees) instead of Rs#50,000/- (fifty thousand rupees). Secondly the Company will pay to Your Highness during the Option Period R3.2,500/t (two thousand five hundred rupees) per month instead of Rs.2,000/- (two thousand rupees), making Rs #1,50,000/- (one hundred and fifty thousand rupees) in all instead of Rs.1,20,000/- (One hundred and twenty thousand rupees Should the Company terminate the Agreement or declare its in ti a tention to take up the concession before the expiry of five years from the sibling of the Agreement, the balance of the UJ 00 * 3 JK _j C ^ , Rs.1,50,000/- outstanding at the date of such termination or ■ * ^declaration will be payable to Your Highness. Certain points in regard to the form of contract, which No. had he on ......... 1 JUi. » • Vi- '&gt;had been raised in a previous conversation by Your Highness* Revenue Minister, were next discussed and the Clauses which I suggested might, subject to the approval of our Directors, be incorporated in the contract appeared to satisfy Your Highness. In regard to your request that provision should be made for the payment of compensation in the event of accident to any of the Company’s employees I stated that I felt sure that my Company wouid agree to the payment of such compensation. I asked whether the rates and conditions of compensation as laid down in the Indian Workmen’s Compensation Act would be suitable and I under stood Your Highness to assent to this. I informed Your Highness that we would draw up and submit to Your Highness a draft form of Agreement for Your Highness’ approval; and you confirmed that there would be no inconvenience to Your Highness or disadvantage to my Company if (as will almost certainly be the dase) the draft form was not ready until after Your Highness’ departure from Karachi. You will appreeiate that the sanction of our Board of Directors must be obtained before the draft form of Agreement is submitted to Your Highness, but I can assure Your Highness that the draft form of Agreement will be posted to you without undue delay. 5. Your Highness mentioned that part of the frontier between Your Highness’ territory of Cwadar and Kalat State was not de marcated and foanr I confirmed that we would not coranence operat ions on any area in dispute until the frontier had been de marcated. If, after the signing of the Agreement, delay for any rea son in the demarcation of the frontier prevents the Company from taking advantage of its rights under the Agreement, Your Highness will no doubt be willing to come to some arrangement whereby the Company does not suffer loss as a result of such delay. 6. If there are any further points which Your Highness wishes to discuss, I shall be very pleased to call at any time conven- kk ient to you. I would again repeat my gratitude to Your Highness and Your Highness’ Revenue Minister for the hearing so kindly accordedPILE GO** GOVERNMENT OF INDIAf M External Affairs , ] ^7 Department. , ^ | Q Q * EXPRESS LETTER (AIR [N.B .

My dear Hay, Could you please refer to my Express Letter No. 222-3 of 9th May 1938 on the subject of the Gv/adur-Kalat boundary. 2. I discussed the matter further with the Sultan on 25th June without going into details. He made the tentative suggestion that before the demarcation was undertaken the Khan of Kalat should send to the Government of India a map in which was marked the Kalat - Gwadur boundary according to Kalat ideas. This seems a sensible suggestion in itself, but I imagine that if the proposal Is passed on to the Khan, the latter will reply that the Sultan should do likewise. The Sultan could do this and the Government of India will then be in a position to see how far the two claims differed. 3.

We learn on other hand that representative of former Company has been discussing Gwadur Concession with Sultan at Bombay and it is stated that Sultan has suggested that Company should send representative to Muscat in October to conclude agreement.

McCulloch, the representative of Indian Oil Concessions Limited, is at present at Karachi where he is in touch vd.th Lt.-Col.Sir T.C.W.Fowle,K.CI.S.,C.B.E., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and with the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Mr. McCulloch has been given permission by the Politi cal Resident to continue with the negotiations between Indian Oil Con cessions Limited and the Sultan and, as I understand it, to conclude them upon a provisional basis before the Sultan leaves Karachi, which I am told he intends to do on the 10th July. Mr. McCulloch has received from his Company all necess ary instructions to proceed, including the following instructions, namely:- (1) To use the form of Agreement, copies of which you have and which, for identification, are endorsed with the date 28.4.38. (2) To avoid altering such draft excepting to fill in the monetary terns agreed upon in the blank spaces provided for the purpose and, if necessary, to fill in the blank spaces in Article 25 with 'the President of the Peiman-ent Court of International Justice at The Hague.” (3) To make the Agreement conditional for its effective ness, on the consents thereto being obtained from the Government of India and the British Government, the Clause to be added at the foot of the draft for this purpose, reading as follows — ’'The foregoing provisions of this Agree ment are conditional upon and shall become effective only as from the date upon which the Sultan obtains approval thereto as provided for by the Agreement between the parties referred to in the letter dated 21st Jamadi I, 1341 (10th January, 1923) from Tairaur bin Faisal to Major Rae, H.B.M.Consul, Muscat, it being understood that the Sultan will obtain such approval with all reasonable dispatch.' The Political Resident has asked Mr. McCulloch whether the foregoing Clause emanates exclusively from the Company or whether it has received the sanction of the India Office. The Clause has rot, of course, received the sanction of the India Office, and with a view to enabling negotiations to proceed to a conclusion, I should be glad if you would tell me that you have no objection to such a conditional Agreement being concluded on the basis of the Clause I have quoted above.

Reference correspondence endii ith your oelspram 1 0.958 dated the 19th l ay 1938 regarding G-wadur Gil Concessions. A 2. Gur comments are as folloY/s:- (a) Clause 17 in B.CvTs letter - The Company should on±y be allowed to transfer its rights with the concurrence of Sultan . In Article 22 of tbe 1.0.1’s agreement some such words as n subject to his approval of its constitution' night be added. (b) The B.C.Cs letter contains no provision for termination of the agreement by the Sultan. Such a provision should be inclui’ed. It is understood that the only sanction that can be enforced in the event of the breach of a concurrent agreement between His Majesty’s Govern ment and a Company obtaining a concession is the termination by the Sultan of the agreement between himself and the Company concerned. It seems desirable that, if possible, any agreement should contain a clause which would permit of such termination by the Sultan, though this may be difficult if, as appears to be the case, the Sultan refuses to take official cognisance of any agreement between His l ajesty’s Government and the Company. 3. It is suggested that any agreement should give the Sultan (a) a right of pre-emption, and (b) the right to assume control of works etc. in the event of war (Signature) oror on ths occasion of a state of emergency. Of Clause 20, Part VII and Clause 9, Part IZ of our ining Louies and Standard Poms of Prospecting Licence and 1 ining Lease”. 4. It is p re scorned that provisions to ensure tin t the Company •v,,. working the concession will always be mainly British - Of Clauses 18 and 19 in Part VII of the Standard Pom of 1 ining Lease - will, if possible, be included in any agreement between the Company and His majesty’s Government. 5. ii point Yiiich we omitted to mention in our telegram 3 NoJjSll dated the 14th May 1938 is that we consider it undesirable /jf.that different Companies should bo operating in the small ar enclave end the adjoinirg portions of K?lat territory. The position with regS'.rd to Kalat is that both the-Buma Oil Company a.nd Indian Oil Concessions Limited wish to obtain concessions. It is X ^ f ! necessary for the latter Company to obtain a certificate of x approval and it has not yet been decided wnether this should be given to them or not. In any case it may be a long time before a concession is granted by the Ilian of Kalat to either Company. It might perhaps be suggested to 'the Cultan that he siiould wait and see to which Company a concession is granted in Kalat before coming to a decision himself. The issue of the above has been authorised.

Dear Hay, hfi u-n- fro For your information Streatfeild saw tiie Sultan of *’uscat in Bombay on 16.6.38 and showed him a copy of tiie letter dated 28.4.38 wnich he (the Sultan) had previously received from our London office. The sultan’s only comments were (in Streatfeild’s words) as follows '(D (ii) h- rysj (iii) 3K He noted the increased oiXer made at his request. He drew attention to the fact that royalty on gas was not mentioned. I said that we would be prepared to pay this at usual rates on gas soldi® but pointed out that there v/as practically no proppect of a market for gas. He appreciated this. He did not agree to the clause that the con cession could be transferred to any Company. ■ | He said he might definitely object to certain { Companies entering his territory. I advised that we were quite prepared to make it any I British Company. This appeared to satisfy him. (iv) He was not quite clear as to the procedure to be adopted when ootaining H. hCs sanction to the agreement. I said that we should be quite prepared to arrange this as soon as a mutually acceptable agreement had been readied. I seemed to sense some slight feeling of irritation at this clause, which I understand is quite probably the case. (v) in response to a query from him I advised that the payment of -/4A per ton (clause 14) covered only stores imported oy the Company for its own use and for the use of its employees for their own use. I agreed that neither the Company nor its employees could sell to outsiders anything duty free under this clause. This appeared to be accept able to him. * 2.

Dear Gibson, Military Branch. . I 27th J\ine, 1938. Mn £ %v(5U~ k {m fiJr &gt; M-* As Jarrett is away, I am writing in reply to your letter of the 19th May (P.Z. 5424/38) about the Gwadur Oil Concession. 2. The Admiralty considers it very desirable that the Gwadur Oil Concession should go to the Burmah Oil Company rather than to the half-American (and presumably American controlled) Indian Oil Concessions. We have, however, no special comments to make on the terms of the two Companies* offers, except that Article 17 of the Burmah Company*s offer in their letter of the 28th April enables the Company to transfer their concession to 'any other company' and Indian Oil Concessions appear to ask for similar powers in the preamble to their draft, in which the term 'company' is stated to include their 'heirs and assigns'. We think that at least some definite provision should be made in the Political Agreement to the effect that transfer would be conditional on the assent of H.M. Government, and would prefer that similar provision should be made, if possible, in the concession itself. As regards the Burmah Company, it would presumably be stated in the Political Agreement that^consent would be given to transfer only to a British company, and should the concession go to Indian Oil’Concessions, it should be possible to stipulate that British interests shall be maintained at at least the strength (50/) which they apparently have to maintain to satisfy Indian law, and that transfer will not be permitted to any company with less British interest. 3. We have no objection to the procedure for the exchange of Political Agreements between H.M. Government and the Companies, which being adopted for Muscat, being followed in this instance/ J.P. Gibson, Esq. , India Office, S.W.l. it d 3.?: tsoM SEcrri; v, pouti-'l and SEGKET DEPT. IUD A OFFICE 28 JUN1938 INDIA OFFICE'TBWWITV1 'BHi instance. It is not however clear whether you propose to follow the same procedure as with the Muscat concession vis-a-vis the Sheikh. He is apparently prepared to be rather more amenable in respect of Gwadur than in respect of Muscat, and might therefore be prepared to sanction the pre-emption agreement and acknowledge more openly our rights under the 1923 Agreement in respect of Gwadur. 4. We would of course like to see the Political Agreements in draft before they are signed, and we would like them to provide in the usual way for pre-emption and non-user of defence sites. 5.

Reference No.:-P.D. My dear Gibson, 859/4/3 Dean Stanley Street, ' ' Millbank, ^. London, S.W.l. fa With reference to your letter of 19th May No.P.Z.3424/38 regarding the terms of the Burmah Oil Company’s letter of 28th April, and the Draft Concession enclosed with Ballantyne’s letter of the same date, it is rather difficult to comment satisfactorily on the merits of the respective proposals at this stage, as the Burmah Oil Company on the one hand give only a Brief outline of the heads of an agreement together with the financial terms which they are prepared to agree to, while Indian Oil Concessions Limited have produced practically a complete form of Concession Agreement (which follows fairly closely the other Commercial Agreements in the Persian Gulf) hut without the figures, so that it is not at present possible to compare the financial terms. On the whole the offer made by the Burmah Oil Company is a reasonable one and compares satisfactorily with the J. P. Gibson, Esq, India Office, S.W. 1. • &gt; 4, akih \Concession however, the financial payments will be on the high side, as I understand that the available area in financial terms of other agreements in the Persian Gulf area. Considered in relation to the area to be covered by the Gwadur is likely to be only a small one when the boundary is finally.demarcated. I notice that under Article 7 of Ballantyne’s Draft the Company may ’'declare*' when it lias found crude oil in ’’commercial quantities”. I mentioned to you in my letter of 27th May regarding the Bahrein unallotted area that I H-l 3 f. disliked the inclusion of a clause relating to the payment of certain sums to the date of the achievement of ’’commercial production” at a specified rate. Although no specific production figure is here mentioned I see no necessity for any ’’declaration” of ’’commercial production” as an alternative to a declaration of intention to take up the mining concession The latter is quite sufficient and the financial consequences are identical in either case..mm ■ P.Z. 3761/1938. Extract from letter from &gt;^etroleum Department (Mines Department), S.¥. 1, dated 2?th May, 1938. I notice, however, that in the schedules attached to Belo-rave’s letter reference is made to a 'definition” of the discovery of 'oil in commercial quantity' upon which apparently certain of the payments depend. It will he recalled that when the Bahrein Petroleum Company's lease was under revision we pointed out the difficulties which might arise from the inclusion of such a provision, and the Bahrein Petroleum Company's lease was eventually amended so as to delete all reference to the discovery of oil in commercial quantity, and to provide, in order to safeguard the Sheikh's position, for the payment of an increased annual payment after a specified time. (In I 0 1 1 this connection see my letter to Laithwaite of 15th February, 3 1934*) Although some of the Persian G-ulf covmercial agreements have contained references to the production of oil Tf in commercial quantity' I think we have a good case here for eliminating this unsatisfactory provision and following the practice adopted in the case of the lease already granted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The royalty proposals are in accordance with the usual scale which prevails in the Persian Gulf.r^- y 28th 1938, From - Lioat* Colonel W.E.1T.Abraham, Cecil Hotel, Simla .

Ballantyne &amp; Company, 11, Birchin Lane, London. E.C.3. ELECTRIC LAW PRESS LTD., DEED &amp; GENERAL LAW PRINTERS, LONDON. W.C.1.Gwadur Oil Concession. P olitical (External') Secretary . When the two Companies were given permission last January to enter into negotiations, it was contemplated that these would take place at Muscat. But during the Sultan's official visit here Mr. Culichand got in touch with Indian Oil Concessions, Ltd., and we consequently allowed both Companies to start preliminary discussions. These have now reached the stage described in Mr. Gibson's note. The Companies seem to have kept us fairly well in touch with the progress of their discussions, especially the Burmah Coy., which has sent us copies of their correspondence. Mr. Ballantyne (for Indian Oil Concessions) now asks our consent to their offering to sign an agreement, with a clause that it is subject to H.M.G.'s approval. The requirement of government approval to any concession is of importance in the case of Gwadur for a particular reason (apart from the usual general grounds), viz .. that the Gwadur-Kalat boundary is undemarcated. Col. Parsons last November told the Burmah Coy. that an application affecting this boundary question could not be considered, as it was most undesirable that it should be/be raised at the present time. The G. of I. have been considering this point with the A.G.G., Baluchistan, and the latest proposal is that representatives of the two States should meet to settle outstanding points (P.Z. 1176/38). eanwhile, in our letter to the Companies of 31st January we informed them, with the G. of l.’s concurrence, that any concession obtained would be subject to the approval of H.M.G., who, in deciding whether to grant or withhold it, would have to take into consideration difficulties arising in connection with the boundary. Mr. Ballantyne s present suggestion would mean that the concession would be signed (albeit with a suspensory clause) , «* * , and the first payment under it would be made before we are certain whether we can approve the concession. We now understand that the Sultan may be leaving on Monday next, so that it is not likely that anything can be signed in this country. Could you submit a draft informing the G. of I. by telegraph or air mail of the present position here and of Mr. Ballantyne's request, and asking for their views generally and with particular reference to the boundary question? When t * we get their views, we can consider the request of Indian Oil Concessions to be allowed to offer to sign with a suspending clause, but if this were agreed to, the other Company should/mm ■n mm -- should also be informed that they also may try to obtain a concession with a similar suspensory clause. In the meantime, what we have told the Burmah Coy. holds for Yr. Ballantyne also - that the terms of the concession should be submitted for approval before anything is signed. /aJ *1 v WCOPY.

You state that you have informed His Majesty’s Government of this and that the High Government have been pleased to recognise me as Sultan o^ Muscat a.nd ’Oman. I would request you to convey my thanrcs to the High Government. I am writing to inform you that I have in conformity with the orders issued by my father ascended the throne of the Sultanate to-day and have intimated to the members of my family the decision of my father to abdicate from the throne and that he has nominated me to succeed him. They have approved of that and have accepted me as Ruler of the State. I would request you to inform the High Government that it is not hidden from me that I shall endure in my rule by the continuance of their help and assistance to me and my vtoverrment in the same manner as my ancestors were helped by them. \nd it is hoped that you will assure the aforesaid Government that I have accepted all the obligations to the High Government descending to ^e from my father and that I am determined to follow his policy in all my relations with Government and that I rely on the help of the Government and declare that in accordance with the wishes of my father I will be guided by its views in important matters, as I am assured tbst the Government will not be pleased except in what profits my State and desires the maintenance of the independence of oui Goverrr ent and Gult‘^nate. And since nowadays there are no Ocher representatives of those powers in Muscat with whomwe are in treaty relations we would request His Majesty’s G-overnnent to inform the Governments of the United States, France and Holland of our accession. In conclusion I thank Your Honour for your sincere wishes and hope that our friendship and union may continue. Yours sincere friend, (Sd.) Saiyid bin Taimur. Dated 2nd Shawal 1350 (10.2. 32)INDIA OFFICE, P.Z. 459/38. WHITEHALL, S.W. 1 31st January, 1938. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 5th January I am directed by tne Secretary of State for India to inform you that there is no objection to the Burmah Oil Company, as one of the Companies interested, entering into negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat for an oil concession in respect of His Highness’s territory at ^wadur, provided that the application to the Sultan is submitted through the Political Agent, Muscat, and that the latter is kept in touch with all stages of the negotiations. I am to add, hov/ever, that the Sultan is under an obligation not to grant permission for the exploitation of oil v/ithin his territories without the approval of Government, and that consequently any concession obtained by the Burmah Oil Company in respect of the enclave of Gwadur would be subject to the approval of His Majesty*s Government. The latter, in deciding whether to grant or withhold such approval, would have inter alia to take into consideration the difficulties arising in connexion with the bounoary betv/een His Highness's territory and the State of Kalat wnich has not been demarcated. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) J.C. WALTON. The Managing Director, The Burmah Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsoury Circus, iii. C. S■M When I saw the Sultan yesterday he volunteered the information that he had now received the letters addressed to him at Muscat by Indian Oil Concessions limited and the Burmah Oil Company about oil rights at Gwadur. He also said that he had been in touch with the two Companies in London; that, so far the best offer had been made by the Burmah Oil Company; that he would give the concession to the Company which eventually offered the best terms; and that he would like to clench the matter before he left the country. At the moment both Companies have been warned that they should not conclude an agreement with the Sultan without first obtaining our approval; but as the Sultan seems bent on concluding the deal at once, it seems desirable to reconsider our* attitude. Tn the case of Muscat proxies we are now proposing that the gr»ant of approval by His Majesty’s Government should not be made dependent on the Sultan accepting the/the provisions of the Political Agreement 'between His Majesty’s Government and the Concession Company, and if this suggestion is adopted we shall presumably have to follow the same course in the case of Gwadur. That being so it is for consideration whether we should tell Indian Oil Concessions Limited and the Burmah Oil Company that they are f^ee to conclude an agreement with the Sultan on the understanding^on their pant^ that the approval of His Majesty’s Government would be dependent on their' entering into a political Agreement with His Majesty’s Government on the lines of the proposed Political Agreement between His r^ajesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions Limited. Mfe have already told the Companies (a) that the Sultan is under an obligation not to grant permission for* the exploitation of oil within his territories without the approval of the Government and that consequently any concession obtained by them would be subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government, and (b) that the latter in deciding whether to grant or withhold such approval would have/rtk 3. yf. have inter alia to take under consideration the difficulties arising in connection with the boundary between the Sultan*s territory and the State of Kalat which has not been demarcated.HMHH ^ ~ _ v &lt;tV CONFIDENTIAL.

During the Option Period, the Company to have the exclusive right to explore for and to produce natural petroleum and natural gas within the Area, and to produce the products therefrom.

I am now instructed by my Government to enquire if Your Highness is willing to agree not to exploit any petroleum which may be found anywhere in your territories and not to grant any permission for its exploitation without consulting the Political Agent, Muscat, and without the approval of the High Government of India.

There have been the following further developments since writing my note of yesterday*s date in regard to » the above, viz : (A) This morning Mr. Ballantyne telephoned to say that Rai Sahib Dulichand had asked (by telephone) for an appointment at 2 p.m., and although he had not mentioned # his business, it seemed clear that fci' was connected with fa, Gwadur. After consu]/tion with Mr. Walton, I informed Mr. Ballantyne that we did not wish to intervene at this stage, but would like to be informed of what took place at the meeting. (B) This afternoon Mr. Ballantyne telephoned the following account of the interview: After saying that he had been brought to England to deal with the Sultan*s private business, of which the Gwadur oil question was part, Dulichand mentioned the letter sent by Indian Oil Concessions to the Sultan on 4th February (P.Z.964-flag *A*) and said that the Sultan was willing to discuss terms which must, hov/ever, include a cash payment in advance. He then indicated that the Sultan regarded himself as being an entirely free agent in this matter, and Mr. Ballantyne says he got the impression that the Sultan is determined not to have His Majesty*s Government connected with it. He also got the impression that the Sultan does not intend to let us know about his approaches to the Oil Company. Mr. Ballantyne then said that at this stage of the conversation he reminded Dulichand that the letter from Indian Oil Concessions had been sent through the Political Agent at Muscat, whereupon Dulichand denied that 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 10P2 such a letter had been received, and said that in any case it was nothing to do with the Political A gent* Mr* Ballantyne is fairly sure that I&gt;ulichand was lying, but he let the matter drop, and the meeting ended by Mr. Ballantyne giving Dulichand copies of the letter to the Sultan and the Draft Concession, which he said he would take to the Sultan. So far as Mr. Ballantyne is concerned, the next move is with the Sultan. In order to make our position clear, I referred Mr. Ballantyne to paragraph 2 of our letter of the 31st January at P.Z. 459/38 (flag , B*). He said he fully understood the position and would be guided by our advice^COPY GPP P.Z.1176/38 / Copy of a confidential letter No. 32-3 of 1933 dated Bushire, the 7th January, 1938, from the Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi. ^uted the 22nd December 1937&gt; asking for my comments on the application of the Burmah Oil Company for a prospecting license in G-wadur. Companies in the field for the Cwadur concession i.e. the Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. representing 50% American and 50% British Indian interests (vide paragraph 2 of India Office telegram No.2809 of the 26th November 1937)&gt; and the Burmah Oil Company Ltd., which is of course a British concern. It is presumably preferable from our point of view that the latter should be givai at least an equal chance of obtaining the concession. 3. I appreciate Mr. Caroe’s general arguments that previous to the giving of a concession it would be better for the two States of Kalat and Muscat to come to a reasonable compromise over their trade differences and also to demarcate their fronts*. The following, however, has to be borne in mind. Though the Sultan cannot actually give an oil concession to any Company without the approval of the Government of India (see Undertaking by the Sultan of Muscat regarding oil 1923 at page 319 of Aitcheson’s Treaties Volume XI) there is nothing to prevent the Company starting negotiations v/ith His Highness. If, there fore, we were to try and restrain the Burmah Oil Company Ltd., who as an entirely British Company may be more under our influence than their rivals, from opening negotiations with the Sultan, there is nothing to prevent Indian Oil Concessions Ltd. from approaching him. This they might do through the Standard Oil Company of California during His Highness’ tour either in America or in England. Subject:- Attitude of Kalat State towards Gwadur I have the honour to refer to your letter No.F.564-N/37 2 The situation appears to be that there are two oil u./Lu On the balance of advantages, therefore, I am in favour of allowing both Companies to negotiate with the Sultan forthwith, and I suggest that they should be informed accordingly. 5 .

It seems desirable to make some attempt to settle the outstanding differences between Kalat and Muscat not only on account of the applications which have been received for oil concessions in the Jabal-i-Mehdi area, but also on the general grounds. It has been suggested that a meeting might be arranged between representatives of the two States in the presence of the Political officers concerned for the purpose of reaching an amicable settlement. I am desired to enquire whether you consider this practicable. 3. One of the difficulties is the difference of status between Muscat and Kalat.

The Concessionaire will commence exploratory* work within one year from the date of the Concession and diligently continue with such exploratory' work until the whole of the territory has been thoroughly explored or until it is determined that there are no prospects of locating areas containing petroleum deposits within Your Highness’s territory, such exploratory work and subsequent prospecting and mining work to be carried out in accordance with good oilfield practice and with all proper zeal and diligence. In return, the Concessionaire shall make to Your Highness the following payments:- 1) The annual sum of Ps.5,000 payable on each anniversary of the date of the concession until the Concessionaire declares it has found oil in commercial quantities, or until it renounces the Concession, and 2) Ps.100,000 upon the declaration of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. 3) A royalty of Ps.3 per ton of net crude oil produced and saved, plus a royalty equal to one-sixth of the field price received from the sale of any natural gas recovered by the Concessionaire, and with the understanding that after the declaration of commercial discovery, Your Highness will receive at least Bs.50,000 per year by way of royalties, 4) A further payment at the rate of 4 annas per ton of net crude oil produced and saved, in return for freedom of concessionaire from all taxes and duties. The Concession to contain all such reasonable provisions as i^re deemed to be necessary to express the terms and conditions of the Concession arrived at ultimately between Your Highness and the Concessionaire,Your Highness may rest assured that if a Concession is granted to the Concessionaire, the obligations of the Concessionaire will be undertaken in the same spirit, with the same promptitude and with the same scientific and general thoroughness, combined with that due regard for the welfare of the Subjects of Your Highness within the territory, which our Associates have exhibited elsewhere within neighbouing Kingdoms.

CtMtAftto* ^ (j} tUn^ As will be seen from the papers below the Burmah Oil Company and^a newly formed Indian Company known as * » ''Indian Oil Concessions Ltd.” a^e interested (as part of larger plans concerning the exploration and exploitation of oil resources in India and Baluchistan / in obtaining an oil concession in the Muscat enclave of Gwadur on the Mekran co^st. • x- By the temns of the undertaking given by his predecessor in 1923, the Sultan of Muscat is precluded from granting permission for oil exploitation within his territories without the approval of Governmen t, and we are thus closely concerned in the matter. With the consent of H.M.G., Petroleum Concessions Ltd. have recently obtained a concession in respect of the whole of the Sultan’s Arabian territories, and as they are not interested in Gwadur there seems no reason why others should not be allowed to compete for that area. f It has in fact already been accepted that both C tl ^ J Companies should be allowed to compete for the Gwadu^* concession and the Sultan was Informed accordingly shortly before he left on his world tour. But we have not yet said anything officially to the Companies and we have still to decide what reply should be made to the Burmah Oil Company's letter of the 5th January at P.Z.106/38 (Flagged). In that letter the Company refer to their application for a prospecting licence over a portion of the Kalat State, adjoining Gwadur, which was refused by the Baluchistan authorities on the ground that any such application would automatically raise the question of the 8063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 IOP undemarcated/2. undemarcated boundary between Muscat and Kalat State which it was undesirable should be raised at the present time; and since the granting of a concession in respect of Gwadur would equally r»aise the boundary question they enquire:- (a) whether there would be the same objections to the opening of negotiations v/ith the Sultan of Muscat in respect of Gwadur? (b) if not, what would be the correct procedure to adopt? (c) if yes, whether they may rest assured that pending settlement of the boundary issue no| other application will be considered and that when the way is clear they could look to H.M.G. and to the Government of India for support in their* own relative negotiations? As regards (a), we now have (see letter at P.Z. 195/38 flagged) Mr. 08^6* s version of the reasons which influenced Colonel Parsons to reject the Companies* application for a prospecting licence over the Kalat area. It seems doubtful however whether, taken by themselves, the reasons given in that letter are sufficient to justify our v/ithholding permission for the Companies to enter into negotiations with the Sultan, though no doubt the boundary question and the relations between the two States, are factors which would have to be considered in arriving at a decision whether approval should be given to any concession granted by the Sultan.

Dated Quetta, the /3 December 1937. Sir u.'S' , In reply to iiajor Hay*8 letter No. F. 564-N/37, dated the 30th November 1937 I have the honour to s^y that Colonel Parsons left no record from which it is possible to con clude what were his exact reasons for holding that it is /y undesirable to raise at present time the question of the undemarcated boundary between Gwadur and^^^at. I learn moreover that he did not th ; nk it necessary to explain his objections in the course of his meeting with the represen tatives of the Burmah Oil Company. 2. It occurs to me, however, that his attitude may have been influenced by the fact th it there is at the pre sent time considerable friction between the Kalat and Muscat States, due to a divergence of interest in the ma ter of control of the trade which uses Gwadur as a base to serve the hinterland of Uekran and adjacent ^arts of Iran. It is believed that His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in the course of his recent visit to Delhi raised objection to the duties which the Kalat State authorities impose on goods imported via Gwadur, on the ground that such goods are subjected to a double duty, namely a Gw a dur transit tax and a Kalat import duty. On the other hand, as the Government of India are Jawar^|J7JOT^a0.5T*S1ate in their turn wish to develop 'NCIA FOREtGN SECRETARY’S their/ K Letter No. ? .0 J Dated , p Received 1 0 JmNtheir own port at Jiunri as a rival to (iwadur, and have approached the British India Steamship Company with a re quest that the Company’s steamers may call at triat port, the object being to m. avoid the transit duty imposed by the Muscat State at 'JWadur. Col. Parsons may# hsxxxxx perhaps# h 3 ve thought that any development scheme or concession rais ing the question of demarcation of the halat-Gwadur border would be inopportune in view of the trade disputes which have arisen between the two States. Prom such Knowledge as I possess of this matter I am inclined to agree with this view and in particular to doubt whether an oil con cession# part of which would be in liuscat territory and part in adjacent Kalat territory, could be easily worked, until the authorities of the two States h-tve arrived at a reasonaloie compromise regarding other matters in uispute along the Mekran coast. 3.

Sir, We have the honour to inform you that we recently applied for a licence to prospect for petroleum over an area of approximately 42 square miles in the neighbourhood of Gwadar. At that time we believed that the whole of this area lay within the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, and our application was addressed to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bushire. Later, it appeared that about 8.5 square miles of this area lay in the Kalat State, Baluchistan, and an application for this portion was submitted to the Political Agent, Kalat and Ghagai, Sibi, the application addressed to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, being revised to include the balance of approximately 33.5 square miles. We were informed by the Baluchistan authorities that the boundary of the territory of the Sultan of Muscat was not accurately defined and that it was undesirable to raise the question of demarcation of the boundary at the present time. Since that question would inevitably be raised by the granting of the desired prospecting license, they did not propose to grant a concession to us or to any VpOSLA??'pai'ty over the area in qqgstj nn^i..^ i-MruosilRF IN AIR N xix EN0L0SU R t IN AIR MAIL LLTTtf NO.

With regard to the remainder of the area we received a communication from the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, informing us that the pro cedure governing an application for a prospecting license or an oil concession in Muscat territory is different from that in force in India and recommending us to approach the India Office in the matter. At about this time the Sultan of Muscat, accompanied by the Political Agent, Muscat, visited Delhi and some pre liminary conversations took place there between the latter arid a representative of this Company. In these conversations we were again recommended to obtain sanction from the India Office to the opening of negotiations with the Sultan, but as the Sultan was then On the point of starting on a tour to Japan and the U.S.A., the matter was not pursued further at that time. of Muscat would equally raise the boundary issue we now have the honour to enquire (a) v/hether there would be this similar objection to the opening of negotiations with the Sultan for the area in question; (b) if not, what would be the correct procedure to adopt (c) if yes, whether we may rest assured that pending settlement of the boundary issue no other application will be considered and that whe!i^ the way is clear we could look to His ^ j Majesty’s Government and to the Government of ; India for support in our own relative negotia- 1 tions.

Please refer to my telegram No.2323 of the 27th November and connected correspondence regarding oil concessions at Gwadur, ending with your letter to the Agent to the Governor- General Baluchistan No.F.o64-N/37, of 30th November 1937. The next step will be for me to inform both Companies that they may submit applications for concessions through the Political Agent (see paragraph 5 of your telegram No.2326 of the 27th .iovembery; cut as the Sultan has now started on his world tour there is no urgency about this and it may be preferable to defer doing so until we have the result of 1°ur enquiries about the boundary question (see paragraph 5 of your telegram 2309 of the 25th November and your letter to Baluchistan of 30th November). 2. If there should appear to be a serious difficulty about the boundary the communication to the Companies would be suitably guarded. As regards the suggestion however in the last sentence of your telegram of the 25th November, would it not be sufficient, instead of expressly telling the Companies that ’’Government may eventually be compelled by existence of the boundary question to withhold their approval of any agreement reached”, to say merely that ’’they may submit applications through the Political Agent on the understanding that any concessions granted by the Sultan will be subjectto the approval of His Majesty's Government ,, # Such approval is required by the terms of the oil undertaking given in 1923 by the Sultan’s predecessor (see Aitchison Vol. 11 - Part III - No. XX). Itwill in any case be desirable to make the communication to the Companies subject to this understanding, and if there is a difficulty about the boundary question this would then be one of the factors to be considered in due course in arriving at a decision whether to give approval. The issue of the above has been duly authorised.Draft Paper. POLITICAL Department DRAFT EXPRESS LETTER. 24 DEo 5/ From Secretary of State for India To Government of India, External Affairs Dept.

Watts told me yesterday (a) that Sir Aubery Metcalfe had said on 20-11-37 that he could see no objection to Watt’s menti ning the matter to the Sultan (b) that since the Sultan was leaving on a world tour on 30-11-37 it mi ht be wise to arrange something before that but (c) that before we coult/ actually negotiate wi tl the Sultan he (Watts) would require the sanc tion of the India Office, and he therefore suggested (d) that I should today cable my London Office asking them to get in touch with the India Office and request the latter to cable the necessary sanction to Watts. 3, I should not be worried about any of this were it not that last week, in Quetta, Colonel iarsons said definitely that applications for the eastern part of the same area could not now be considered, as consider&amp;t ion of any auch application would automatically raise the question of the undemarcated boundary between Muscat and British territory and he xJwrBfwxwx thought it most undesirable that this question should be raised at the present time. The question/-question of the boundary would presumably be raised just as much by an application to the Sultan for the Western portion as by an application to Beluohistan for the east ern portion, and before taking any action on the lines of paragraph 2 (d) above 1 should like to be assured that auoh action would not meet with the disapproval ul the Govern ment of Indi&amp; # 4 # I ought to add that %tt 8 is under the impression that I mn today cabling London on the lines sug ested by him. It was only after further consideration of the implications and possible consequences of inis action that 1 decided that I ought xirst to put the matter before your Department* I tried to get Watts on the telephone this morning to let him know that I was doing this, but failed* I attach a copy of a letter received a few days ago from the Resident, rersian Gulf, indicatin that the correct procedure now is an approach to the India Office in , ndon* If I do not now cable, such an approach will presumably be made by our London Office in a week or two - but by that time the Sultan will have left Bombay.

Z.7692/37) are flagged at P.6271/1920 in the bound volume. These papers (which are numbered 1 to 14) do not purport to deal with the question of the boundaries between Kalat State and Gwadur, but they contain two references to that question, viz. on page 5 appears the following sentence:- 'The boundaries between Kalat State and the possessions of the Sultan of Muscat have never been exactly demarcated but they seem to be fairly well known and never to have formed the basis of serious dispute.' and on page 7 appears the following passage:- 'At the end of 1913 the question of the possible rendition of Gwadur was again raised over the intention to demarcate the boundary between Gwadur and Kalat. In this connection the Sultan Saiyid Faisal placed the matter of the demarcation of the boundary entirely in the hands of the British Government. Owing to Saiyid Faisal’s death soon afterwards, and the fact tha.t our relations with France as regards the Treaty were still unsettled the question was dropped. It was, however, raised the next year again by the Agent to the Governor- I General in Baluchistan, but again seems to have been shelved.' The Registry have not been able to trace the 1913/ 14 papers and we do not appear to have any other papers regarding the boundary question.

As regards the G. of I.’s telegram of 25th November, now received, there is no British control policy in operation in respect of Gwadur, and consequently there is no sufficient reason why the California Coy. (which asked first) should not be given the same opportunity of applying as the Burma Oil Coy. merely because the latter is British. Indeed, since we postponed consulting India on Mr. Ballantyne’s enquiry, having no reason to suppose (as I informed him) that any other company was interested, I fear that the California Coy./ )Coy. would feel unfairly treated if they are not permitted to apply. A paragraph has been added to the draft telegram.

Petroleum Concessions, Ltd. , have recently obtained two oil of the province of Dhofar and the other in regard to the the oversea enclave of G-wadur on the Mekran coast . The concessions are subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government which has not yet been accorded. Sir Trenchard Pov/le thinks that Gwadur was excluded from the concessions because Petroleum Concessions Ltd., were not interested. If that is so there would appear to be no puima facie objection to allov^others to enter the field; and the usual objections to American operators might not be of so much importance if, as was suggested by Mr. Ballantyne, the Government of India may not be unwilling to allow a group containing a 50,0 American interest to operate in India and Baluchistan.

Mr. Ballantyne then said that Standard Oil Company had no information as to whether Gwadur had oil possibilities but even if their investigations in that direction proved to be negative, they would still be interested because of its possible uses as a port in the event of the Group obtaining oil rights in Baluchistan. Mr. Ballantyne was informed that it would be necessary to consult the Government of India in the matter. He asked that this should be done by telegram (for which the Company would be prepared to pay if necessary; because his Principals wished to fulfil a promise made by Mr. Hamilton to give an early reply to the Sultan of Muscat.
