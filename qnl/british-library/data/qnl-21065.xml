Bahrain Hofonaa -v Your talagraa of 8/3/23. rschccl me too late bo reply by last aall I out in oanp &amp; had not boon in t# Man^Ath for a ooupla of ia/s. . • I agrao that the proposal to ta ^e all oaaog in the Joint Court night 'bo attentad with diffioaltiea, out this was only su^cgesti aft^r a groat doal of oonsidaration \*hioh had led aie to the con clusion that it is practically imposelbl# to devise ary native Corirt here which would safeg-uerd the Interests of the 3h4fclis. In tb&lt; first placs one auat realise that the Shsik's faiiily &amp; adherents aire now eetiaated to 'be not less than 1000 persons ^ that practical] all toe oppression cf Bahreinis is due to them. Any Sunni iiaBib«yrs of a court would openly ^ide \'ith the shaiks against the 'Bahrsinis, Even Yusuf Zanoo.who ought to be one of the laost enlightened Sunnis k will talk about oppression when it suits his own boolc because he is on bad torjis with sone o^t the stalks, is at heart throughly bigoted hates all 3hiaha. If Bahrminia were appointed as ae^bersj of a court,under preseiit conditions it would be Impossible for v .hea to give any decision which Taight be distasteful to the ShaiiLS.Tht latter can always*take it out o-P th«» T indirectly by such methods as intimidating their servants so that fehey will not wor.iL luT t -hem forbid Ung people to rent their property etc, to say nothing of deliberately faking false charges against them.Ko Bahrain! of any substance would agreo to serve,eb others would be bribed ny the 3haiks who would continue to oppress &amp; always hide behinif the cove of the court 's unjust decisions. Our object vfcich is to remove epprersion would not be gained &amp; we should b« accused by both aid of instituting a ayatera which would give no relief. The only 0+' solution I can think of would be for Bahrainis to el«Jfct ra•sl ,nrs*-.* &amp;jisjzi in • ^ a court Sa for such rwmebr«a to ba put under British protection,Und« such conditions probably alKtoat any of the leading Bahrainls would b willing to j^erve.but such protection would have to be for life. Perhaps the simplest way out of the whole difficulty would be the strenr :th ^nin(* of the hand as regards putting Bahrainis under British protcction.7he principle ha.^ always been recognised So would reouire no alterations in tho Bahrfcjn Order in Council. the Shai^c were clear?y ^iven to understand that the P.A. had Snail powers to ^ut under protection any person he had reason to believe was unfairly dealt with &amp; Had not a fair trial,it would have a very great effect. The P.A. would have to be given a freer hand in this respect than in the past.He should have discretion in a lAanner scMewhat similar to the iManimission of slaves in Bahrain ( as distinct from Mainland slaves) &amp; it should not be necessary for hia td do more than report to the 'Resident any protection certificates granted ^ a short suiTaary of tho reasons for giving it. Qovonuiont would hava to recognise that for the first year or so the Folitical Agent night have lo give a fair nUiibor of certificates ( I do noc ^f course aieaB a vast number,but it night run into 20 or 50 the first year) eut the weapon would be &amp; powe^r -ful one &amp; would very quickly stop o jprejsion on a large scale &amp; after a short while it would probably be unneoeasary to often resort to its use® You will resieiaber that last year a couple of u.«n had to be so put under protection,also in onti or t?/o oases I have taken advantage of a clause in the Bahrain OrdHr iii Couiictl &amp; havo pat under protect-| ion servants of British subjects 5: British protected persons to stop boycotting. The effect of this action was vary great .In fact I think it frightens the Shaik more than anything else as he has visions of his subjects slipping a ey from hisi .Of course ths Political Agent should be instructed to use the utnost discretion &amp; not i30 put under protection any £ every person who applies for it without careful consideration o 7 the circonstances. Under such conditions it would not bn neeossary to put Bahraini members of a court under protectior, but they could be told that protection would be given theia if at any tirte they were expressed. Had I been empowered to plave a few person under protection or to deuand the release of one or two aen whowojjre 111 traatod &amp; la ft languishing in prison without any trial vor.T little 9f thf5 agitation unong the Bahrainis which has recentl, occurred would 3ver have taken place, but no Political Agent would ta^e t.hij responsibility of such action without specific authority, which at prnsent the Political has not got. There is a sort of gene ral allusion empowering the P .A. to interfere in oases of gross oppression, but it would isfin a vast aaount of correspondance rap a p rob a 1/ reports to India, whioh one naturally tries to keep cl -ar of Also once the Political Agent rrav-? a certificate we should have to 8e« it ruspcctoci. It would be fatal to lu-vo a recurrence of a case like Diokson &amp; the Do sari woman, PoA?»8 art hunun &amp; it night occur that they put a person under protection under oiroumstanoea that tie 'Resident deeEied insufficient,Having bee.1 d; le it would have to be adhered to,but doubtless the Resident would bo able to see that a r-ji;;:*.'?ar caso did not oocar.In th« aa,1ority of cas^s th-i ^.A. could prob^ly hive time to getA the f^sidents sanction first.In excepti# ional ones he might have to do it off hio o^n bat 4b report after. ..v Since I have been heja I have not found any serious attearpt o^ the Shaiks to interefere with any person who has been put ynd;;r protection.If any attempt is made at all it has always been speedily dropped on a slight hint frow tb?&gt; Agency. The aain point is that the Sh&amp;ik should know that the P.A. has authority to is ;ne a X &gt;rotection certificate when necessary &amp; it will be upheld. There would be no need for fresh legislation £ a sort of combined Court with Bahrainis on it could be introduced without aiuch trouble if th* P. A. could thus protect tho meabers if nooessary.Outwardly we shou2 not be interfering with tho I3haiks Court,though actually the P.A. *3 powor would ensure fairly just decisions. A3 regards tho diving,! do not think the system proposed would entail much work for the P .A» It might require nursii^ a little at first but would ultimately reliive us of a tremendous numbar of disputes &amp; do away v^ith much oppression. Thera will be a fair amount of work for tho Diving Cosanittee,but as you seo it was proposed to pay thee. &amp; it may be remembered that all the trade of Bahrain practically, is indiredtly due to the pearling,&amp; the ruler &amp;his tmtire fsatlly c% oauntl^ss hriug^ra-on live oat of tJ» ouatoMS ^hieh indirectly roaal^ th^ryf3ron.lt does not anem imr^adonable tho fore that he ahonld bo required to hare n IMpartiaent,which woa.1 d incidentally be self sapporting oat of the tax^a derived,whioh would 338 th*t tin diving waa rim on a reaaoaiably clean baaia.

Offloe of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated 5th Dhul Quad 1345 i To The H. B. M 1 s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that H. E. Shaikh Hamad is desirous of instituting a subsidiary Oivil Court competent to deal with civil oases in which the amount involved is not more than Rs. 50/-. A court of this description existed previously in Manama and lately several leading merchants and notables have suggested tiat it should 'be revived. At present owing to the amount of cases which are 'brought into the Bahrain Oourt, parties often have to wait for several weeks 'before the first hearing of their cases, frequently one of the parties leaves Bahrain in the meantime. It is thought that the proposed court, sit tin? three times a week, will 'be a'ble to deal promptly with the innumerable small cases, often involving only a few rupees, oetween petty shopkeepers and their customers which at present occupy so much of the time of the Bahrain Oourt. Shaikh Hamad considers that the usefulness of the court would 'be much increased if it had jurisdiction over protected as well as Bahrain subjects. This could be effected if the court included a protected subject, or preferably, a member of the Agency staff. On thispage -2- thls % nuestlon^he requests your approval. As at present proposed the 0ourt will consist of Oaptain R. L. Parke, assistant adviser, and another raemher to lie appointed 'by Shaikh Hamad, probably one of the lesser Shaikhs of the Ruling family. Personally I strongly advocate the suggestion, The Bahrain Oourt, ^/hioh consists of myself and Shaikh Salman, Shaikh Hamad's eldest son, three and sometimes four times a week from about 8 a.m. until 2 p.m., taking on an average 25 - 30 cases each day. In spite of this a formidable number of pending cases accumulate. The result is that only two mornings in the 7/eek remain which I Qan devote to other work. This is not sufficient. I venture to state that my duties here are not supposed to consist mainly of court work, but that the court work should be subsidiary to the other work. Also during this s i Jmmer while the Director of Customs is on leave, I shall need time to supervise the Customs. I hope that this proposal rill meet with your approval and that you will find it possible to sanction it. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government, Bahrain.

In a demi-official letter of 17 March 1923 (folios 2-7) the Political Agent (Major Clive Daly) discusses proposed reforms with the Political Resident (Major Arthur Trevor). These include: the institution of a joint court and native court, the persecution of Shia citizens by the Sunni-dominated judicial system, and a system of British protection that could be extended to Bahrainis facing persecution. Pearl diving reforms are also touched upon, with a description of how pearl divers are paid in the industry in Ceylon [Sri Lanka]. Later correspondence (1924) between Daly and the new Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Prideaux) relates to the drawing up of judicial codes for Bahrain, with the help of existing codes from Sudan and Iraq, which already exist in English and Arabic.The second half of the file contains correspondence from 1927, and concerns administrative changes to the Bahrain courts, rather than outright reforms. A request from Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah for the institution of a subsidiary court to hear cases involving financial claims of less than fifty rupees, is approved by the Political Resident (folios 14-17, 22). A letter from the Political Agent (Major Cyril Barrett) to the Advisor to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Belgrave), dated 14 May 1927, raises concerns over Sheikh Hamad's intention to appoint three Sunni Qazis [Qadis] to sit at the court at Muharraq, citing the extra time and costs involved (folio 20). A Bahrain State letter, from Shaikh Ḥamad to the Deputy Governor of Bahrain, dated 21 Dhul-Qadah 1345 [23 May 1927] confirms the Deputy Governor's appointment to the Sharah court, for a monthly wage of one-hundred rupees (folio 21).The date given on an office note from the Political Agent (folios 18-19) of 10 May 1937, is probably incorrect and should read 10 May 1927.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000364#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
