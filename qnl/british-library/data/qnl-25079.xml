On Wednesday, the 26th August, the 4th Battalion of the 42nd Regiment, with one gun from Ali-el-Gharbi and one gun from Amara, left for Katif. This force consisted of 200 men. They were accompanied by 100 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion of the 42ncl Regiment and by the newly appointed Mutessarif of El Khasa. Tim Chief of Gendarmerie at Bussorah was also dispatched to make inquiries as to the origin of the disturbances.

'Sphinx' at Basra, 28th August 1P08 Sir, continuation of ir^ letter No»4Sb of 20th Inst*, T have the honour to report, that latest information indicates a further improvement, in the state of affairs at El Katif and the prospect of early relief, 2.- On my return here, yesterday, T heard that 320 Turkish Troops and two guns sailed for Katif on the 26th inst, 3. - There has been no piracy since the boats were cleared out of Darin. Three boats which left Katif with refugees about, the 12th August, arrived safely at Bahrein and ten more boats arrived at Bahrein from Katif, flying the Turkish flag, on the 23rd inst. Food and supplies are getting in to Katif, but, one isolated fort in a neigh bouring village is still cut off from communication and is in a bad way. The Bedouin attacks do not appear to have been so frequent, or determined lately, 4, - The ,f Redbreast M and Agency launch have been cruising as necessary to prevent piracy and Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter reports that confidence Is being restored amongst the seafaring people. To avoid the chance of the Bedouin capturing boats laying at, Darin and using thorn for pirady, no boats are allowed to lay there longer than is necessary to replenish with water and provisions. Sheikh Mubarrak of Koweit told me he had given strict ‘'Mnder-in-Chief, orders H,;I*Ships &amp; Vessels, EAST INDIES.orders to Koweit, boats with regard to this, 6.- The Agency launch has been temporarily commissioned vath a Sub-Lieutenant in command and a European crew of six, her own crow of 21 natives being retained, A 3 pdr. and 2 maxims have been mounted on board. Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter reports that she is very useful and is economical in coal and Tat or* ' ;ith a vlaw to disassociating British action in the suppression of piracy from any apparent intervention on behalf of the Itirks or interference in their affairs. Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter lias been directed to avoid visiting Katif in the ship, unless it is absolutely necessary to ascertain that no acts of piracy are taking place. Darin will be visited by the Launch when necessary to make sure that no pirates are harboured there. The Bedouin know that H.'2,Ships are in the vicinity to stop piracy and it is considered that the occasional appearance of the launch, whilst the 'Redbreast' remains generally at Bahrein or cruising on the pearl banks, will suffice to prevent the pirates taking to the sea. 7.- Orders lave been given that no one is to land at Katif or Darin, unless the Political Agent wishes to do so himself, and that no request of the Kaimakam’s is to be acceded to without instructions. Sheikh Jasim of Darin is supposed to be implicated in the Bedouin revolt, but I gather that his general attitude is that known as sitting on the fence. When Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter visited the Kaimakan on the 16th (before he had received my orders) he was requested to arrest Sheikh Jasim and hand him over to the Kairaakam, but Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter very properly explained that he was unable to take such action.SITUATION AT EL KATTP. CO££. ,N,0.42c/O8. « # f 1 ’’Sphinx” at Basra, 1st September, 1P08, Sir, In continuation of my previous reports, with reference to affairs at El Katif, t have the honour to inform you that 320 Turkish troops and 2 guns with 2 months 1 provisions were safely disembarked at Katif, from the steamer ’’John 0*Scott”, on the 28th August, without opposition* 2. - The Turkish Commodore, here, informed me he had heard the Bedouin were dispersing, and he considered it unlikely that they will offer any determined resistance to the troops. 3. - Sheikh Jasim of Darin has fled to Bombay. It is understood he feared that the Kainakam of Katif would take action against him on the arrival of the Turkish re inforcements. The Sheikh requested a passage to Bahrein in ’’Redbreast” on the 17th August, but was refused. 4.- The Agency launch returned to Bahrein on the 28th from a cruise in Katif waters and reported everything quiet af1oat• I have. et c *, * (Sd.)

I t,N,fi^2/08. ’’Sphinx” at Basra, ]8th August 1^08, Sir, I have the honour to forward the attached report, received today from Lieutenant &amp; Commander Gould smith of ’’Lapwing”, with reference to the state of affairs at Katit and his proceedings there, 2. -- News of the affair first reached me by private letter on the (5th and in anticipation of requirements t telegraphed to ’’Redbreast” at Muscat and Henjam on her way back from Karachi, to proceed to Bahrein with despatch, to detain ’’Lapwing” there if necessary and to place himself at hisposal of Political Agent, Bahrein, The sense of your telegram No.20, re use of Political Agents launch was also transmitted. 3. - ”Redbreast” left Hen^am on 11th instant and arrived at Bahrein on the 13th. ’’Lapwing’s” report, attached, is of that date. 4 . - On 12th instant I received a telegram from Resident at Bushire, fthich it appeared desirable to transmit to you for information - see my No*75 of that date to the effect that it was anticipated that the Kainakam of El Katif would shortly request British assist ance to save population from massacre as the garrison were being starved out. Resident also requested the services of two gun-boats (already arranged for) and intimated that Government of T ndia was being asked how far we can help the Turks in view of close commercial relations between Katif and Bahrein &gt;he Commander-in-Chief, H.M.Ships &amp; Vessels, EAST INDIES.I also submitted proposals to you for arming the Political Agent 1 s launch for use in shoal water against the piratical dhows of the Bedouins and that T should remain in telegraphic touch at Basra for the present, proceeding to Katif later on if necessary* Your approval of above proposals was received on 14th instant, telegram No.21. 5*- On the 14th instant I rcjceived further information in letters from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to me and to H.M.Consul here indicating that the state of affairs at Katif was very serious indeed, 6. - The gist of this information was communicated to you in my telegram No.76 of 14th instant, in which T also reported the strength of the force T could land if such action was approved. It was my intention to rely on the co-operation of the Turkish reinforcements and to cover the landing from the Political Agent*s steam launch. Neither 'Sphinx” or the Gunboats can approach within several miles of Katif. Tt is understood that these Bedouin will not face guns or disciplined troops. 7. - The attitude of the Wali of Basra within whose jurisdiction Katif is, has been difficult to understand. He was aware of the state of affairs on the 6th instant, if not before, and lad been requested by the Kaimakam to send re-inforcements and the Turkish Gunboat. On that date he returned my visit and in conversation told me he was going to send troops and expressed the hope that we should render assistance which would bo very welcome. He also expressed thanks for the moral support and assistance already indirectly given to the Kaimakam by the presence of the M Lapwing” and the measures taken to check piracy. The Wali waswas informed that no more active assistance could be rendered in the absence of a formal request in writing and the approval of the Government# I urged him to send troops and his gunboat without delay. The Wali has been repeatedly urged by H#M#Consul to hasten the despatch of reinforcements but so far without result# He refused to send the gunboat ’‘Kilad Bahar’ 1 in any case. A few days ago H.M#Consul telegraphed to Constantinople recommending that steps should be taken there to get the despatch of reinforcements hastened# On the 15th instant the Wali definitely assured B*M*Consul that 150 troops and 2 guns would leave for Katif in the shallow draft steamer M Kizimi H on the 16th but their departure has been delayed. It is now stated that 180 soldiers leave tomorrow. The estimated strength of present garrison at Katif is 70. H#M#Con8ul informed me after an interview with the Wali, that the latter, while in no way deprecating the possible intervention of British forces, is unlikely to make any formal appeal in writing* He appears to still hope that he may get assistance without compromising himself to this extent. The Wali’s hesitation may be due to his fear of further reducing the garrison of Basra, already depleted to deal with disturbances up the River. The Commandant of troops, on the other hand, is anxious to send a relief force at once. 9#- Bahrein is a difficult place to communicate with* There is no telegraph and only a fortnightly mail from Bushire. There is a weekly mail up from Muscat, but a telegram sent to Muscat for post to Bahrein takes 5 days to reach its destination. T would submit that the present, statei \C Q) state of affairs illustrates the necessity of telegraphic conununioatnon# As soon as the first information reached me i on the 6th I wrote to Lieutenant and Commander Sluter pointing out the necessity for acting with great caution in A this Katif matter and to use no force except in the case of actual piracy. On the 14th the Steamer 'Jaffari' offered an opportunity ror communicating again and T informed the S*N*0# at Bahrein that* pending decision of the Government* his actions must be confined to checking piracy and succouring escaping refugees* S.N.O* was also directed to arm and man the Agency Steam Launch as necessary under command of Sub- Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune of 'Lapwing” as an auxiliary and to be prepared to land maxims and every available HJuropean man with rifles* Lascars as necessary for carriers* and to endeavour to devise a shore mounting for 3 pdr* Q*F. This was in order to avoid delay should the Wall make a proper request for assistance and Admiralty approval be obtained. Tn that case it was my intention to hasten to El Katif and direct the operations* P.- On the 16th instant I received your telegram No.22 directing no action to be taken on behalf of Turkey without Admiralty sanction but only assistance to refugees as necessary. Later the same day No.23 was received informing me that the Admiralty did not wish bluejackets landed at Katif and that Naval assistance must bo confined to what is possible from sea in boats. t had already issued instructions in the spirit of these orders as will be gathered from the above* but in view of this definite decision and to make certain of no mistake T4 ) I have decided to proceed to Bushire where t have 3ust heard ,f Lapwing” will arrive tomorrow for coal. J will communicate with Lieutenant &amp; Commander Gould smith and if necessary proceed myself to El Katif, confer with Lieutenant &amp; Commander Shuter, ascertain latest state of affairs, and return to Fao to regain telegraphic touch on the 25th, after visiting Koweit where my presence on the 22nd has been particularly requested by the Political Agent. i S possible 'Lapwing' may bring a request from Kaimakam. 10. - 'Redbreast' and 'Lapwing' will remain at Bahrein - Katif as long as may be necessary. The visits of 'Sphinx' and 'Lapwing' to Karachi will probably have to be abandoned. Whilst the present state of unrest in this part of the country continues the presence of a ship will be necessary in the River to protect British interests apart from the usual date season requirements. 11. - The above in conjunction with telegrams 75 and 76 is a general summary of the state of affairs to date and of the action taken. 12. - A further report will be submitted as soon as possible.

Sir, P'' With reference to Article 248 of the Station Orders, T have the honour to report the proceedings of H.M. Ship under my command, carried out in accordance with the request of H.M.Political Agent of Bahrein, vide the attached Requisition. 2. - T embarked Major Prideaux, T,A., on the 2nd August, and left the following day for Katif, arriving there the same afternoon. The ship was accompanied by the Agency Launch, under the command of Sub-Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune of this ship, tho crow having been augmented by 1 Armourer's Mate, 1 Leading Signalman, 4 Marines and interpreter, with maxim gun on tripod. 3. - Apparently the trouble at Katif, arises through the ill feeling between the townspeople of Katif, and the Bedouin. •The Subai and Amair tribes have joined forces with the Bedouin of the Interior, and a large force has collected around Katif, and are constantly attacking the town. It is believed that about 30 to 50 men liave been killed each time these attacks have taken place. 4 . _ All the country around Katif seems panic stricken, and trade is at a standstill. Thousands of date trees have been cut down, and it is said, 28 villages have beer looted and burned, which fact, appearances seem to confirm. About 800 refugees left for Bahrein at the end of July, and since then three more boats full have left the town; more would like to leave, but are afraid of the Bedouin by Sea, Apparently the Anik and the Katif Forts are the only places he Senior Nava] Officer, 0,1 Persian Oulf Division, H.M.S.'Sphinx'i* 4 on the Oasis which have not fallen at the hands of the Bedouin: and I am informed that a boat containing S3 men from Katif were all slaughtered near Darin, recently, I return to Bahrein on the 5th August, and dis embarked Major Pridoaux, The Agency Launch arrived at Bahrein on the 7th August. Sub-Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune reported that (in accordance with my orders for him to visit the Kaimmakam of Katif, to enquire if the rumours of piracy in the Katif district were correct, also whether we could be of any assistance to the Kaimmakam) the existence of piracy and insurrection in the district were true. The Kaimmakan stated that the people'who were causing the trouble at sea, made their headquarters chiefly at Darin, He stated they came from the Katif side of the bay to Darin, where the people and Shaik Jasim were in sympathy with them, and aided them with provisions and boats. The Kaimmakam then asked me to arrest all dhows between Ras Tanura and Bahrain, particularly those at Darin, and hand them over to him, when, he stated, fie would be able to distinguish the innocent from the guilty. T aceedc3d to this request, and ordered all boats in the district, to keep away from Katif waters, or they would be arrested. The Kaimmakam. stated that it was impossible for him to efficiently control the Sea adjoining his territory without the assistance of a Oun-boat; and said that if we were willing to assist him in this respect, such assistance would be acceptable, Tn the meantime, he had telegraphed for more troops and a Oun-boat, but considering the troubled state of Turkish territory north of Basra, T doubt if these will be available. 6.- Both the ship and the Agency Launch left Bahrein on the morning of the Pth August; the ship anchored off Ras Tanura the same afternoon, and T proceeded in the Launch to visitvisit tho Kaiminakam* From my conversation with him, the trouble in the district is rather increasing than diminishing. It took a long time before T could get him to admit that he was unable* through lack of troops* to keep off the Bedouin* and if he does not very shortly get re-inforcements* the situation will probably become critical* He said he hoped to get re-in^orcements in a few days time from Basra, but if he does not get them* and the situation is the same* he would then request me to land men and guns to help Mm achieve his object* T told him T would endeavour to keep the pirates off the Sea, so as to enable him to get supplies, and also let those desirous of leaving the place, do so. 7.- t remained at anchor off Katif for the night, and during the night heavy firing was heard, all round the district. This firing has been continued for the last week, and has been heard by the Launch during her previous visits. Numerous date groves have also been observed on fire by the Launch* 8*- On the morning of the 11th August, Shall: Tasim visited me on board, and reported that the pirate Ahmad Bin Selman has joined forces with the Bedouin on the mainland* and also that the Bedouin had obtained a gun from the Turkish Fort at Dammam. P.- On the morning of the 13th August, T sent the Agency Launch to Ojar to find out any news, and the ship proceeded to Bahrein, arriving here this afternoon. t have, etc... (Sd.)

I The Under Secretary of State, INDIA OFFICE, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to transmit herewith, for the informat5on of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of a letter dated the 20th August last, received through the Commander-In-Chief on the East Indies Station from the Senior Nabal Officer in the Persian Gulf, together with its enclosures, relative to the situation at El Katif. A similar letter has been sent to the Foreign Office. A copy of this correspondence has been forwarded by the Commander-in-Chief to the Government of India. * I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Q TFT o • #COPY SITUATION AT EL KATIF. Sir W SPHINX W at Rushire, 20th August 1908. In continuation of my letter (No.42) of the 18th instant, forwarding report of H.M.S* 'LAPWING*8” pro ceedings at Rat if f dated 13th Au?^ust f I have the honour to forward a further report from lieutenant and Commander Gouldamith with reference to certain points about which it appeared desirable to have further information. 2.- A report received from Lieutenant and Commander Shuter of H.M.8. 'REDH^EAST' is also forwarded (original and 2 copies). Prom this and from the verbal report of Lieutenant and Commander Gould smith it appears that the situation at El Katif has considerably improved, and Lieutenant and Commander Shuter*s opinion that it never was as serious as at first supposed may prove to be correct. It now appears improbable that the Turkish Authorities will request our active assistance. The ion^ delayed re-inforcements from Basra were to have left on the 18th t but I have heard no news of their depar ture yet. The report that they are being sent has apparently checked the activity of the Bedouin. There appears to be no reason now why refugees who desire to escape from Katif should not do so unmolested and trade be resumed. I understand that the Katifs are likely to regain confi— dence when they learn ine Commander-in-Chief H. M* Ships Ft Vessels, EAST INDIES. of the safe arrival at Bahrein of a partyk \o V ^ * , party which has left since the piratical craft were warned off by the 'LAPWING' and Agency launch. 3«- I attach a copy of instructions issued to the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. 'REDBREAST' which H. M. S # 'LAPWING' will convey to him, and then return to meet me here I / with the latest information on the 25th after my return from Koweit. I do not think it desirable for either 'SPHINX' or 'LAPWINO' to leave the Oulf at present, but the actsial presence of more than one gunboat in Bahrein or Katif waters does not seem to be necessary under existing circumstances. 4.- Should the situation at 'atif develop and our assistance be requisitioned and approved I do not consider, in the light of further local information furnished me by Lieutenant and Commander Oouldsmith, that any force that could be landed from the fiulf Division or even one of the larger ships could do more than hold the fort near the shore at Xatif and perhaps drive out the Bedouin from the date gardens near the walls of the town. Tb clear the neighbouring country of Bedouin, assuming that their ammunition holds out and the garrison, when re inforced from Basra, cannot exhaust their patience a military expedition of at least 500 native troops would p obably be required, and their landing could more con veniently be effected to the northward of Has Tanura. There appears to be no reason whv the .^rrison should starve ~o long as the pirate dhows of the Bedouin keep away, and whilst the fort on the shore side of Xatif stands wr'stands, the beaoh abreast the town is conunanded. I understand that it is only want of confidence and enter prise which now prevents frequent and free communication with Bahrein. 5. - With regard to the further information furnished by Lieutenant and Commander fiouldsmith in his report of the 30th instant it would appear to have been better had the Political Agent interviewed the Kaimakam himself. Lieutenant and Commander Gouldsmith informs me that his action in warning off Darin boats was taken at the request and with the concurrence of the Politioal Agent, and it appears to have been t stifled in its resulting in the cessation of piratioa] acts - T understand that Sheikh Jaseim of Darin is suspected, with good reason, of complicity with the Bedouin. 6. - Lieutenant and Commander Shuter has been instructed that if any more interviews with the Kaimakam are consider ed necessary the Political Agent should be requested to accompany him and interview the Kaimakam himself, or communicate by letter. I think it undesirable that we should identify ourselves with the Turks in this way as it may encourage a hope that we desire to give assistance with the result, that the des patch of proper re-inforcements will bo further de]a'-ed.

Sir, I have the honour to report that I visited the Rairoakam yesterday (16th) at 6.0 p.iru, he seemed to be quite easy in his mind about the situation and said that he had officially heard that troops were being sent to him, but could not tell mo v/hen or how, and he said that this news was keeping a check on the Bedouin and that the town had not been attacked for three nights. There is no news of the pirate Ahmed Ben Salim and the Kairaakam does not think he is anywhere in the neighbourhood. T asked him if the actual presence of a ship assisted him at all, he 'aid that naturally it kept the Bedouin at sea in check, but that lying at Bahrein, the moral effect was just the same, as they never knew when I would be cruising in these waters. The 'LAPWING' is proceeding to Bahrein today to give Majbr p rideaux the result of my Interview, if he agrees with me that two ships are unnecessary she will immediately proceed to Bushire to coal and send my telegram to you, and awaifl your decision as to whether she is to proceed to Karachi or not. I do not consider that the condition of affairs at El Katif are as serious as was at first supposed, though undoubtedly there has been a good deal of fighting. The Kaimakam seemed quite satisfied that their provisions would last until the arrival of the Turkish troops.I have told him that I shall he cruising in these wa f ers for ten days, anchoring at Bahrein and occasionally at Katlf and if he hears of any depredations at sea he is going to let me know at once* I have, etc*.** (Sd.)

Political Agent, Bahrein. The steps taken to stop pirax&amp;y. Sub- Lieutenant Prideaux-Prune received a written request from the Kaimakam to arrest boats between Has Tanura and Pa.hrein, so I. ordered all boats off Darin to leave, otherwise they would be arrested and towed over to Katif. Pearl boats coming in from the Banks were allowed to go in and water, and not to remain in harbour longer than was absolutely necessary. I told any bona fide friendly boats, that if they wanted to take provisions into Darin, they would have to got written permission from v . Political Agent, v Bahrein, before I would allow them to communicate. Paragraph 6 .- I explained to the Kaimakam that I could not take any armed action, unless he gave me a written request to do so, and then it would be necessary for me to obtain permission from my Government.

Six of their number were killed by the besiegers. (N. B .—The “ Lapwing’s ” Interpreter heard of this affair when he landed in Katif on the morning after the event with Captains Shuter and Gouldsmith, but apparently no credence W’as placed in the story in consequence of the Qaimmaqam declaring that the Bedouin had ceased to worry the town.) (it) On the 18th August the Bedouin attacked Saihat, killing 7 of the defenders and wounding 3. (iit) Haji Mansur Pasha has written to a friend in Bahrein that the towns people have begun actually to starve. i (vt) The inhabitants of Qadaih, a walled village adjoining the town, having come to the verge of capture, have succeeded in buying off the Bedouin by a payment of Rs. 4.000 and 8 rifles. (v) There are still villagers holding out, though hard pressed, in Kuwai- kib, Dabaibiya, Madaris, Miyas and Sharia, all villages forming the suburbs of the town. (vt) It is now believed in Bahrein that Abdul Aziz bin Saud is encourag ing the Bedouin, and that he will only interfere when he is offered the Government of fhe Oasis.

With reference to my office diary No. 31-W.

S. “ Lapwing ’* to personally investigate the state of affairs on the 3rd instant. 2. I landed in company with Sub-Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune, R. N., who had been deputed by Lieutenant Commander Gouldsmith to navigate the Agency steam launch Bahrein ” for the time being, at Darin, Saihat and Anich, and found that things are indeed in a critical state for the Turks and the Shia towns men and villagers of the oasis. The villagers of Saihat and the military gar rison of Anich have been beleagured for more than a fortnight and have been allowed no communication whatever with the outside world, though they have not actually been subjected to any active assaults up to date. Katif itself, however, is being attacked every night vigorously, and the sounds of rifle volleys answering each other and of a gun being fired from the fort continue throughout each night. At the Arab village of Darin, on the other hand, there was open and free communication with Bahrein, and there is orave reason to suspect that the Kaimmakam’s vigorous accusations against Shaikh Jasin bin Muhammad Abdul Waehab of complicity in the Bedouins’ rebellion are true in the main. 3. A further report on the whole case will be submitted to you next week. I am writing now to express my belief that unless strong reinforcements are quickly despatched to the oasis, the Turkish garrison will be starved out, and compelled to abandon the unfortunate towns people to general massacre. 4. I have received a numerously signed memorial from the merchants of Bahrein pointing out that, in consequence of their close trading relations with the oasis, they themselves are being subjected to heavy losses from the ruin of the Katifis and the destruction of all property in the oasis. I anticipate moreover that the Turkish authorities in Basra will soon become impelled to solicit the active aid of our men-of-war for the succour of three strongholds, wMch only are now holding out. The Bimbashi of Anich himself told me that his provisions were running very low, and there can be no doubt that the condition of the Katif garrison ‘with its large civil population must be considerably worse. 5. I trust in these circumstances that the eventuality of the Turks’ applying to us for help will be at once taken into consideration, and venture strongly to express the hope that the reply of our Government will be favourable. If before your reply can he received, the Commander of H.M.S. “ Lapwing” or myself receive any request in writing from the Kaimmakam for active assist ance in preventing an imminent massacre, I shall certainly recommend Captain Gouldsmith* to take all measures that he can, short of landing an armed force on Turkish soil, for the protection of the unfortunate people and for their removal if possible to Bahrein.6 No. 2551, dated Bushire, the 23rd August 1908.

MEMORANDUM. On the return of “ Lapwing ” from Katif on the 13th August, 'Lieuten* ant-Commander Gouldsmith, R. N., informed the Political Agent that he had called on the Kaimmakam on the 9th instant and that after some hesi tation the latter told him that if reinforcements did not reach him within about a week he feared that he would be compelled t6 ask the gunboat for some effective assistance ashore. Captain Gouldsmith spent the night at anchor off the town on board the “ Bahrein ” Agency steam-launch, during which he heard heavy firing all over the district. On the 11th August Sheikh Jasim of Darin went on board the “ Lapwing *’ and volunteered the information that the notorious pirate , Ahmad bin Salman had joined forces with the Bedouin, and that the latter had carried an old gun from the ruined Arab fort of Dammam ( ) (once the stronghold of the Chief, Sheikh Abdullah bin Ahmad, of Bahrein) within range of Katif for use against the fort. Three large boat-loads of Katif refugees arrived in Bahrein on the 13th. They confirmed the news about Ahmed bin Salman, and said that he had himself applied the match twice to the gun, after which the Turks made a sally and gained possession of it. Lieutenant Prideaux-Brune, who bad been sent on tbe 13th to examine the coast-line from Dammam to ’Ojair in the Agency steam-launch returned to .Bahrein on 14th, alter having had an interview' with tbe Mudir of ’Ojair. The latter received him very politely and informed him that he had no hope that bin Saud would go near Katif. Bushire, 18th August 1908.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 53 of the 12th instant, I have the honour to report to your Excellency that the Political Resident and Consul-General at Bushire sent me a telegram on the 11th instant, to be communicated to the Senior Naval Officer, who is at present at Bussorah, in command of His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx.” In this he reported that the population of Katif, who are protected by a small and quite inadequate garrison, are in a most precarious position, as the town is surrounded by Bedouins, whose number is estimated at 2 ; 000. Unless reinforcements arrived it was anticipated that the whole population might be massacred. In these circumstances His Majesty’s ship “ Lapwing ” took up her position as near Katif as possible, but owing to the peculiar position of the town no gun-boat can come within range or nearer than 6 miles of the buildings. I am now told that His Majesty’s ship “ Redbreast ” is also in readiness to render assistance if required. I thought it well to interview the Vali of Bussorah, as the Kaimakam of Katif is subordinate to Hassan Bey. He appeared to welcome our action in the matter, and told me that they were preparing to send reinforcements from here either in the gun-boat “ Kilid-el-Behar ” or in a hired lighter, there being a difference of opinion on this point between the military and civil authorities. The Turkish gun-boat draws 12 feet, and cannot approach nearer to Katif than Rais Tenora. Here the soldiers must be landed in boats, and in the process might be exposed to the fire of the Arabs under Jasin-bin-Mohamed Abdul Wahab, who holds Darin, and is in league with the besiegers. He asked me whether it would be possible to obtain the assistance of the Govern ment launch, which is at the disposal of the Political Resident at Bahrein. I told him that I could give him no information on this matter without instructions from higher authorities. Major Cox, in his telegram, had mentioned that the Government of India were being asked how far we could proceed in affording assistance to the Turks in view of our important commercial interests. A despatch from Bahrein, subsequent to the telegram from Bushire, emphasizes the urgency of the case, and I pressed the Vali to dispatch reinforcements immediately. Although he has promised to do so, I am somewhat distrustful, as there are only about 250 soldiers in Bussorah, and the Vali is not desirous of denuding the town of troops. This deficiency is likely to be repaired by the arrival of reinforcements from Bagdad, but in the meantime it is quite possible that the garrison at Katif might be reduced to extremities, and compelled to evacuate the town, and I am accordingly continuing to urge the Vali to dispatch all that can be spared to the scene of action.

This ill-feelinn has been stimulated by some trouble which arose recently between the Katif people and the Subai and Amair coastal _ Bedouin in consequence of the former refusing to allow the Subai and ’Amair to enter the tribal date groves for the collection of their supplies of the date fruits. These Subai ’ and ’Amair have 1 nl'i ed t h rf n&lt; i| S Wlth a h \ Bed0U - ln of n-^ e lntenor and a large combined force has collected all around the oasis. They commenced by making inroads into the date-gardens and killing Bahrams (Shias of Katif) by twos and threes. The latter joined in resistance but were several times beaten back, losing, it is said 50 to 50 men killed each time. The losses on the other side had been com’ paratively small. The Bahranis then lost heart, and the Turkish soldiers stationed in Amk have attempted a demonstration by marching into the desert without producing the desired effect. The situation has since become critical. 1 he oasis is overrun with Bedouin tvho are committing all sorts of outrages. Hundreds of Katifis are said to have been killed, thousands of date-trees to have been stripped of their fruit and cut down, and 28 villages to have been looted and burpt down. About 800 refugees, men, women and children, mostly ot the pearl-fishing class, came over to Sanabis in Bahrain on the 20th July 1908, and dispersed about the village, many of them occupying houses vacated at this period of the year by their owners in favour of more airy habitations along the sea-shore. y The Bedouin are said to have got hold of all the places in the oasis with the exception of the Amk^ and Katif forts. The seriousness of the situation is enhanced by the Bedouin taking to the sea to plunder and kill the Katifi pearl- divers there. A boat containing 23 Katifis is said to have been surprised near Darin by the Bedouin and slaughtered to a man. P Merchants in Bahrain, British subjects and foreigners, who have large interests at stake in Katif have memorialized the Political Agent begging that a gun-boat be despatched in their interests to Katif to relieve the situation ihe Agency launch was therefore despatched by Lieutenant Commander ouldsmith, R. N., on the 30th July under the command of Lieutenant Prideaux- Brune, R. N., of H. M. S. Lapwing to get correct and up-to-date news from the yaimmaqam of Katif. She returned on 1st August with information which i e K^ru7 1 ^u ,C u t ?) th 1 attheSunnire ? idents of Darin ’ the home of Muhammad Abdul Wahhab Pasha are either willingly or unwillingly, in co-operation with he Bedoum and disregardful of the authority of the Qaimmaqam. It is alleo- e d that the piratical Bedouin are making free use of the Darin boats in their operations against the villagers and townspeople of oasis. It is also said that a number of Koweit boats are said to be drawn up at Darin and that the boatmen ^sittmgmacnve upon the island. The Qaimmaqam is apprehensive lest they join the other Arabs in an assault against the fort. ^2 A boat laden with 40 rifles is said to have left Muharraq for Katif on or about coth July and to have been surprised by the Bedouin near the Harbour of Katif. The Nakhoda, Hamad bin Abdallah al Hasan, was slightly wounded in trying to save the rifles, which, however, fell into the hands of the Bedouin who warned the Nakhoda to take his boat back to Bahrain and warn others there not to come towards Katif. It is believed that the Katifis have applied to the Nejd Amir, Abdul Aziz bin Sa’ud to send a force to their assistance. The Qaimmaqam sent on the 1st August a telegram to the Bahrain Post Office for Basra applying urgently for reinforcements, including a man-of-war and some artillery. H. M. S. Lap-wing and the Bahrain Agency Launch were about to proceed to the vicinity of Katif on the 2nd August to check marauders from adventuring on the sea. r * • * ' ' • ’ . BUSHIRE : Qth August IQ08.
