Dated 26th ^arch, 1949. To, H.M's Political Agent, KUWAIT. Sir, I beg to state that it is some months ago that you wrote to the Residency about my house rent. I had made it clear then that I will be satisfied with a house rent allowance of Rs.200/- per mensem and would not ask for any increment if it was sanctioned. I now understand that there is no hope of getting that allowance and as I find it difficult to carry on without such help from the Government - as my pay does not help me to pay such high rent in Kuwait - I reauest you to kindly refer my OL case again to His Majesty’s Government through the proper channel asking them either to sanction the rent as from the time I joined Foreign Office Service or alternatively to give me an increment of Rs.200/- per mensem from the same period. I reauest you to allow me to add that I am quite willing to serve His Majesty*s Government for years to come provided I am given a fair salary to cover my living expenses. Sir, you know well how hard it is to live on such meagre salary that I am now getting, which is*almost half of what some of the local Government em ployees are getting, and that I can get double the present pay anywhere in Kuwait. I sincerely hope that you will kjndly consider this, my humble request and assist me as much as you consider it reasonable. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant,no. % (y£). k? VO © The Political Agency, Kuwait. 30th March, *49 Thank you for your letter No.48/29/49 dated the 18th March, 1949. have spoken to Mr. Abdul Mohsin and he has accented Rs.557/-. That matter is now settled, h 2. as regards Mr. Kadoo, he is very much distressed that the rise in pay proposed for him amounts only to Rs.17/8/- and I have been unable to propitiate i &gt;“ f him. Indeed he has submitted an application v/hich I / forward and support with the request bhat something should mnxbe done to ire rease his rate of pay immediately. You are not, naturally, acquainted witn Mr. Kadoo and perhaps I may explain that he is a Christian gentleman of an old Mosul! family of very high standing, before ipining the Agency he was a teacher in English and Arabic and except for a few lapses in idiom ne would pass for an European. 3. The Oil Company a few years ago offered bo send him home and give him a special course of training and on his return to Kuwait 0 ive him pay at a rate about double of what he is now getting from His Majesty’s Government. He could earn this today. 4. His daily work is contacting the senior bheikhs of the Kuwait Government and the merchants to whom he is well known and who highly respect him. Another point I should like to make it clear that the Interpreter in this Agency always works under great difficulties since he must be acceptable to the Sheikh and to the Kuwait Government and serve H.M.G. at the same time. 5. I think it is essential some means of enhancing hispay are found, and perhaps a special allowance of Rs.200/- per mensem as Personal allowance could be arranged. I am sorry to press the matter, but I feel the case is urgent and deserving. A.J. Johnson, Esq., Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.COPY I 48/57/49 The Persian Gulf Residency Bahrain, 2nd May, 1949. I enclose an extract of a letter from Gaflov/ay, together with a copy of Kadoo’s submission. 2. The staff situation throughout the Persian Gulf is acute and nowhere more so thafc ^ in Kuwait. Johnson in his letter 127/2/49 of Slst January to E.S. Jones, stressed the difficulties under which we labour due to the Oil Companies being able to offer considerably higher salaries than we can. They are, moreover, able to deal with submissions of this nature on the spot. 3. We cannot afford to lose Kadoo’s services. The pressure of v/ork at this Agency is already high and the rapid development of Kuwait followed by an enormous increase in the number of British and American subjects to look after is increasing the strain beyond all measure, ^adoo’s emoluments, after giving effect to the recently approved adjustment, are as follows Basic pay Rs. 310 Dearness Alice. S i- *\ 255 Rent Alice. , \ • 100 Rs. 665 4. Under present conditions, with far more jobs vacant in Kuwait than persons suitable for filling them Kadoo with his many years' experience must be regarded as irreplaceable. We therefore strongly recommend that a special allowance of Rs.20C a month be authorised for him as a special case. (AX.A. DREDGE) E.A.

This correspondence includes details of Mr Kadoo’s remuneration, family background, past employment and the importance of his role to the work of the British Agency in Kuwait. There is also a passing reference to the increased pay of Mr Abdul Mohsin, the Passport Clerk. Both the Political Agent and the Political Resident express the view that Foreign Office approval for an immediate increase in pay and allowances to the Kuwait Agency’s two clerks is essential for the retention of their services, given the high cost of living in Kuwait and the higher pay offered by the oil companies.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Political Agency</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office, Establishment and Organisation Department, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Israel Kadoo</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Personnel</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00016f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
