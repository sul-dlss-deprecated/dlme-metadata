Also discussed is a proposal to give the bank financial assistance up to a maximum of £343,000 to cover their losses from the disturbances when their branches were unable to open for business. The Foreign Office inquired if the India Office would contribute half of this sum (£171,500). A further issue discussed is the safety of the British colony at Hamandan and the political and security situation in south Persia are also discussed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035407619.0x000001#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035407619.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
