Merewether also goes on to discuss the need to fix the location of the Persian boundary line to prevent further similar incidents occuring.The letter concludes by discussing recent events in the Gulf, including Persian attempts at interfering in Bahrain, the need for Muscat to be placed under the Bushire Resident, and Merewether's opinion that the promotion to the post of Political Agent at Muscat should go to one of Pelly's current Assistant Residents; and gives the remainder of his tour plans as well as the dates he will be in Bombay.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517966.0x000012#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
