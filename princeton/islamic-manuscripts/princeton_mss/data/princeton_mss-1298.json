Physical description: 22 lines per page; written in New Style (NS.1--see Déroche, F., The Abbasid tradition, no. 90) in black on tan unglazed, laid Arabic paper. The vowel signs are dots in red. The ḍammah is represented by a red dot to the right of the letter, the fatḥah by one over and the kasrah by one below (cf. al-Suyūṭī, Itqān, Cairo, 1925, vol. II, p. 171, 11. 27-8). A double vowel is represented by two dots. The diacritical marks are the ordinary ones. A few marks in green have been added by a later hand. Some staining and some loss of text on 15G(a) due to ragged edges. In fair condition. Origin: Likely from the 11th or 12th century (compare with Déroche, F., The Abbasid tradition, no. 90). Fragment 15G(c) has a variant reading for XII:12. Instead of أرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَدًا ىَرْتَعْ وَىَلْعَبْ وَإِنّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ which is the ʻUthmānic reading, the fragment reads أرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا غَدًا نَرْتَعْ ونَلْعَبْ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ", "abstract": "Fragments from a manuscript of the Qurʾān in New Style script, likely from the 11th or 12th century.", "contents": "15G(e): Sūrah XLI:1-50 (in part); 2 leaves.", "extent": "12 leaves : paper ; 283 x 185 (245 x 150) mm.", "identifier": "http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/2n49t4334", "alternate_identifier": "http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/2n49t4334", "replaces": "pudl0112/6915787", "title": "[al-Qurʾān.
