[Regarding pearling concessions.) After compliments. And after it must be within Your Excellency's mind that five years ago there arrived a stranger here who wished to take a con cession to take sponges (a thing which comes out of the sea) and at that time Your Excellency did not agree and it was good what you did. And in these days it is possible that persons will come who will seek, like that, their own profit and the Resident at Bushire has written to me that I should inform Your Excellency that it may be in your discernment because it is possible there may be loss from this to the Shaikhs and their people, especially if they (the persons) should obtain a concession for the diving for pearls and because of this the Resident mentions that if anyone should come and seek a concession from the Shaikh for anything, Inshallah, His Excellency the Shaikh will inform us and take our advice before he completes the affair. This is what was necessary to state to Your Excellency and may you be preserved. Dated the 29th July 1911, equivalent to 2nd Shaaban 1329. No. 6 (&amp;).
