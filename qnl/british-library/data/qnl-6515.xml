Rawlinson. (Vide Letter from Foreign Office, dated 20M December 1889.) The allusion is probably to certain vague offers which were made by Hussein Khan, Adjutant-General, who was sent by the Persian Government in 1836-37 to Paris and London to endeavour to obtain French support for the Shah in the pending question of Herat. That any Treaty or Convention however passed on this occasion is to the last degree improbable, and even if there had been a cession of the Island of Karrak to France as asserted, the whole arrangement would have been swept away by our subsequent conquest of the Island (in 1838) by force of arms after a due declaration of war and without protest from any quarter. I remained for a fortnight in the Island as a guest of the Resident during our occupation in 1839, and am certain that up to that time no suspicion of any French claim upon the Island was entertained by our authorities. If there are any records of Hussein Khanâ€™s visit to Paris in 1836 or 1837, they might be consulted with advantage. H. Rawlinson. London, 28th December 1889. 19258.

The subject is the alleged cession of the Island of Kharg [Iran] from the Persian Government to France in 1836-37, which seemed improbable and, anyway, would have been annulled by the British conquest of the Island, in 1838.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of France, Third Republic</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir 1st Baronet Henry Creswicke Rawlinson</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Kharg</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000af#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
