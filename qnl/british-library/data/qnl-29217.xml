F.O.C.XI, to the Flag officer Commanding, Ro^al Indian Marine, on the above mentioned subject. 2. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of hie letter Colonel ward states that he has already advocated that a light vessel be placed so as to mark the approaches to Bahrein, and he now suggests a light vessel on the parur shoal and another oft Ras Mutaf. I was given to understand that the reason why no light vessel has been placed at Bahrein was that funds not available. It seems therefore to be out of the question to propose two additional light vessels although r nuite a-ree with Colonel ward's view that light vessels in these twolosltioL wcuia be an ff t to the interests serred by the Persian Utilf lighting aaministration. g t wot Id take this opportunity also of bringing to the notioe Of Their tor i 8h ^V ^^e^^e^uif'theif Ls been to the the part of the 'Iraq'Authorities, * issue by raising questions relative to toe efficiency f a buoys olfi« a to W e i xercise P e 1 X ^us e fve P oontrol over the lighting ana buoj ing of their own coasts. , « it is more important first to 4 . it seems to me that it peraien Governmentj solve the political P rob l em ; nf .!ed to exercise exclusive make good their claim an“ P tafce s toofc of the position control, it will be time enoug o ^ ^ qxie8 tion of as it affects pipping ^/experience gained , funds efficiency in the lignt oi. available, etc* t rHd not give a direct reply to 5 .

It appears that the paragraph Is so drafted that the Conservancy Board could In due course take over and maintain these lights from the Indian Government and its Bombay Advisory Committee. 7. If the Conservancy agreement is ratified, it seems tom3 that there should be no question of the Board acting in any other capacity than as contractors and dues collectors for the Government of India. At present the port of Basrah Directorate act as the contractors. This is a perfectly satisfactory arrangement.

I fear that I must plead guilty of having made on erroneous statement when i said that in the case of Kais Island the difficulty had been got round by putting a lightship outside territorial waters. what happened was that the original proposal was to put a light house on Shaikh Shuaibbu it was anticipated that there would he difficulties with the Persians, and therefore in his telegram to the Government of india of the 19th April 1912 Sir .Percy Cox suggested that the difiiculty might he got round by putting a lightship on the Shah All urn shoal, i.e., outside territorial waters* xhis was referred to the naval Commander-in-Chief, who recommended that for technical reasons a light vessel should be put on the Stiff© Bank, also outside territorial waters, .there is nothing further on record in my office except a telegram dated the 8th dune 1912 from His excellency the viceroy to the Secretary of State, saying that the matter was under consideration and a further communication would he . nlft^ed oif Hais isxcinci in 1918 a lightship was suddenly I - under orders of the Director, uoyal Indian Marino, hut r have no oapers in my office heyond a brief intimation of the fact, and as the .hole object of substituting a lisht- i •? vh+bcu °e was to enable the light to b- put ship for a lighthouse ^-hir-iatp difficulties with outside territorial waters ana, * the r* m } C.Wa,lton,Bsq. ,C.B.,M.

Persian susceptibilities. in paragraph 5 of his letter UO.74/157, dated the 16th October 1930, to the naval Comrriander- in-Chief, Hast indies Station, the senior naval officer states that he is informed that it is quite possible to reduce the total number of lights in Persian territorial waters to 12 by removing the Kais Island light vessel and the Bandar Abbas buoys to positions outside territorial waters. xhere would therefore seem to be no difficulty in removing it to some position outside territorial waters if considered desirable, i greatly regret any confusion that 1 may have caused by stating that a lightship was already outside terri corial waters. X should like, if i may, to make a brief comment on Baxter's letter jno. is. 1289/147/34 of the 21st March to Clauson. if the Conservancy Board Agreement now Being negotiated between • Iraq and Persia is signed, then the question of the separate control by the .Persians of their own lights will preaumablj be disposed of, but Baxter's letter rather conveys the impression that since the Persian lights only affect shipping calling at Persian ports and not those proceeding direct up the Gulf and that the volume of the former shipping is relative ly small, it does not really matter very much if they are not maintained in a state of efficiency. I have not got any figures of the relative volume of shipping calling at inter mediate ports and that proceeding direct to the Bhatt-Al-Arab, but an official of the Anglo-^ersian Oil Company informed me the other day that they paid over 80* of the port dues. whatever— - 0 Y/hatever the exact figures may be there is no doubt that the Anglo-.Persian Oil Company tankers do constitute the bulk of uhe shipping 'who use *»he lights# un the other hand the remaindei Oo. shipping, though its volume may not be very large, is certainly very important. it consists of the navy and the two British India Steam navigation Company - the fast mail and the slow mail, and a few miscellaneous ships of Stricks and the Hansa Line# The British India services are, of course, of enormous political importance, and our commercial supremacy in the Gulf consists not in the fact that British, or Indian goods are purchased to the exclusion of the goods of other countries, but that the actual buying and selling is in the hands of Indian traders and that the goods are transported in British bottoms, namely, the ships of the British India Steam navigation Company, in the matter of lighting and buoying and surveying the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the one hand arid the British India Steam Navigation Company and the rsavy on the other conflict. xhe former are only interested in the main route up the Gulf, it is, i believe, largely at their instance that the present survey by the “Ormonde' up the centre of the Gulf is being carried out, and they have been pressing for a long time past for a light on Kas-al-MUtaf. xhe rntish India Steam Navigation Company and the Navy on the o .....r hand would much prefer surveys to be carried out elsewhere fortunate l y for other reasons, with which you are acquainted, it has this winter largely been transferred to Bahrain) and consider a light in the vicinity of Bahrain of much greater importance than one at Has-al*BL i.-a.-t« desirable at present to ask the Persians _ « -yvj the Anrlo ~JL- / ers ian uxi Company a light at Ras-al-Mutaf, ana tne Angxo are . • * * I understand it is not considered for permission to putV' Qz) 0 are reluctant that the funds at present available should be utilised for a.- lighu at hahrain for fear that 'when it is possiole to put a light at Ras-al-Mutaf no noney would be forth* coming. Ward, however, told me that he hoped that money would be forthcoming for both, in which case ± trust that it will be possible to do something for Bahrain, ahe point, however, which i wish to make is that I do not think that the relative importance of the two different types of shipping, i.e., that proceeding direct to the Shatt-al~Arab and that calling at Persian ports, can be gauged from their volume. in a place like the Persian Gulf political considerations cannot be ignored and politcally the British India service is at least as important as that of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company tankers.

Tehran, May 9, 1932. ’ I HAVE not much to add to my despatch No. 217, dated the 7th May, on the subject of King Feisal’s visit to Tehran. 2. I had no obvious opportunity for any lengthy conversation either with the King or with his Prime Minister, and it was not desirable that I should seek to create one. 3. A few points are, I think, of interest: — (a) The Iraq negotiators, ably supported by Mr. Jacks of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, seem to have had surprisingly little difficulty in convincing the Minister of ' Court that Persian interests would really be better served by a businesslike arrangement than by persistence m a demand for a frontier recti^ cation in the Naft Khaneh area which would place the whole oil-field within Persian y”^ {rom the language which he held to me, Femal was notm the least impressed by the splendours of the Persian • „ g ss '33SS 51 “S”' .. »* large house and g.y-den which apparently nobody^v^ ^ ^ of Teymourtache^ran Indfvntoal and on the relatlvejmp^rtance^of^the^part manner ” (evidently His Majesty would have used the ^ n J^ ls \ 1ajest that he known it) with any seriousness.

O N” f Sir, With reference to my telegram No.47 of 23rd May, I have the honour to report that in the course of the conversation recorded in my despatch No.255 of today, Teymourtache made some reference to the Shatt-el-Arah which led me to ask whether Mr. Carroll had already reached Basrah. He replied that he had and that the Minister of Justice, who would conduct the negotiations for the constitution of the Conservancy Board as Feroughi was unable to go himself, would be leaving almost immediately for Baghdad in order to arrive there at the same time as Sir Francis Humphrys. 2. It was clearly impossible to allow His Excellency to start on a three days’ journey with the prospect oi being told on arrival that the other party wished to postpone the negotiations. I therefore told Teymourtache the contents of your telegram Ho.56 of the 19th May explaining that out for the material factor that the Minister of Justice might have been put to unnecessary inconvenience I should have preferred that the question should have been handled by the 'Iraq Legation. Teymourtache agreed that the best thing would be for the Minister of Justice to postpone his departure until Sir Francis Humphrys had reached Baghdad. He went on to say that there was a good deal which did not please him in the draft convention which I had sent him at Sir Francis Humphrys’ request and that he was not at all sure that he liked the idea of postponing his negotiations until Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I.j etc., et 9 The Foreign Office.until the autumn. He touncl it difficult to 'believe that the heat in Baghdad was so great or that the recent Parliamentary Session had been so exhausting that the 'Iraq Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were unable to negotiate at once. In fact he rather suspected some ulterior motive; if there were none why should not ITuri Pasha come up here and negotiate in the pleasant coolness of Shimran? By the autumn ’Iraq would have emerged from the mandate and His Majesty’s Government would be less favourably placed for exercising the good offices which we had promised. 3. Later on while we were at lunch Teymourtache, apparently following the same sort of trend of thought, asked me whether 1 had any idea why King Feisal had abruptly cut his stay in Persia short. I said that I had not even wondered about it because I knew that even before he gave up his trip to Meshed he had changed his mind regarding his plans at least half a dozen times. The motives of another change or two therefore did not appear to me to be a matter to excite my curiosity. 4. I am not altogether surprised at Teymourtache's suspecting some arrier^JlS-M the pr0P0Sed postp0nelient of the Perso-Iraq. negotiations. X am also inclined to telieve that his reluctance to see the negotiations postponed is in some measure due to a belief that if our negotrations synchronise with those of 'Iraq his position will thereoy be improved.

I HAVE the honour to report that the King of Iraq arrived in Tehran on a State visit to the Shah of Persia early on the morning of Tuesday, the 26th April. His Majesty had travelled by motor car from the frontier, where he had been met by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other officials, and had spent three nights on the way at Kermanshah, Hamadan and Keredj (about 30 miles from the capital). „ , ^ , 2. King Feisal was met by the Shah and the members of the Government at the garden of the municipality, a little way outside the Bagh-i-Shah gate. The two Sovereigns embraced affectionately, and after a rest of three-quarters of an hour in one of the pavilions erected in the garden, drove together to the Gulistan Palace, escorted by a regiment of cavalary. The Shah returned almost at once to the Pahlavi Palace, where he received the King s visit a little l&amp;ter. 3. His Majesty dined privately that night with the Shah at the Pahiavi Palace, and on the following night attended a State banquet at the Gulis an Palace, to which heads of missions (who had been received m audience with the staffs earlier in the day) and their wives were invited.

The Persian Government took immense pains to do honour to their visitor. The principal streets of the capital were repaved, half- finished buildings along these streets hastily completed, and extensive repairs and redecorations carried out at the firulistan Palace, which has not looked so smart for a long time. If Tehran could have a Royal visit every few months it would be a very fine city. King I eisal, for his part, was an ideal guest, and his dignity and ease of manner undoubtedly made a great impression on all Persians with whom he came in contact. The mutual impressions of the two Sovereigns are more problematical : they had no really adequate medium of conversation, although they appeared to understand each other in Turkish, as the Shah can speak the Turki dialect of Persia. The visit aroused a fair amount of enthusiasm among the general public. Large crowds lined the streets on the occasion of the State arrival, and the fact that there was no cheering (though cheering is quite common in Persian crowds) may probably be ascribed to uneasiness in the presence of the Shah rather than to lack of goodwill towards the visiting Sovereign. 11. I have sent a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 92) and to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Iraq &lt;No. 53). I have, &amp;c. R. H.

As you will have seen from recent telegrams, it now seems almost certain that the Conservancy Board negotiations will have to be postponed until next autumn. I understand from Sir Francis Huntphrys that he is himself of opinion that in all the circumstances a postponement might operate to our advantage, in that, if the negotiations are conducted in the autumn, it mi ;,t be possible to induce Teymourtache himself to attend.

Provision has been made herein for the nomination of deputy members in order to take the place of properly appointed members when they are absent. This provision is essential as it will not be possible for the Board to co-opt officials for this purpose. It also provides that the Board shall elect its own Chairman annually- Article 4 , which stated as follows:- 'The Board and its officials in the exercise of their functions under this convention/ shall in no way be under the control of the Governments of the High Contracting Parties or of their local authorities' 9 has been omitted for the dual reason that it gives no real power to the Board, and would probably give &amp; \ misleading impression- Subsequent articles hare been renumbered accordingly- Article 5.., The functions of the Chairman are now defined- It has been provided that the Board shall only hare power to raise loans by an unanimous decision. Article XI has been amended so as to gs« the Board power to prescribe a penalty of imprisonment for violation of their regulations- trtlcl. IE ■»» »««» “ ““ « clear «... Bora «y pr.eH!- ••* s » of imprisonment, no officer of the Board shall have the ^ power to do more than impose a fine, and that if imprison ment is considered to be a fitting punishment, the Board must take the case to one of the local courts* This article has also been expanded to give power to the Board to remove or destroy at the cost of the owners any obstruction to the waterway* Power is also given to the Board to detain shipping* Hew Article 19 provides in detail for the exemption of the Board from income tax in both the riparian States and for the import and export of articles required for the undertaking, free of customs duty* It has been decided to withdraw the proposal that the members of the Board should receive customs exemption on imports for their personal use. The diplomatic immunity of members has been sei l out a little more clearly. L ttew Article S3 has suffered the temporary deletion of the first paragraph which gives the King of 'Iraq the right to denounce the convention at six months notice in the event of a fall in the volume of shipping. The '^^inclusion or otherwise of this paragraph is still the subject of discussion* (Intd*) P-B-S.Os Copy. SBCHET. (8). Downing Street* 12th May* 1932. %■ Sir* I have the honour to refer to your telegram Do, 161 regarding the draft Shatt**el-Arab Conservancy Board Convention, and to inform you that a meeting was held at the Foreign Office on the 4th of May to discuss certain observations put forward by the Anglo-Persian Oil Companj?' on the existing draft of the Convention* At this meeting Sir John Baldwin of the Danube Oomnixssion was present and expressed his opinions on various points. A record of the meeting will be sent to you in due course, but in view of the stage which has now been reached in the negotiations, I think it best to ooumunicate to yon at once certain decisions which have been taken as a esult of the meeting* 2* The Company, acting on a suggestion Ox ; lr Arnold Wilson, proposed that in Article 2 the words &gt;The existing boundary mark' might be defined more closely L n the words of the Protocol defining the boundary as 'Pillar Ho. 1 situated on the western bank of the Khaiyw lanal at its eastern junction with the Shatt-el-AraV . Phere is no objection, of course, to the adoption of this wording if you consider it advisable. 3. The Company’s representatives objected to the « Article 2 on the ground that the words second sentence of Artie THE ACTING HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR IRAQ*'forming part of a port' would suggest to the Persian Gorernment that port dues might well be levied at Abadan, Several alternative formulae were discussed, and the suggestion now under consideration is to delete the words 'forming part of a port' and insert after 'jetties or wharves' the words 'the property of private individuals» of corporations or of public bodies, the construction of which has been or may be approved by the riparian authorities s situated on these waterways ‘ihfc exact wording is still under consideration, and I will inform you by telegraph when a decision has been reached 4 , It was agreed that the phrase 'navigational, police and sanitary regulations' in paragraphs 1 and 2 of f Article 5, and paragraph 4 of Article X was misleading ‘ 'Navigational police' had originally been intended, out it was explained that the Danube Hirer authorities issued no police regulations as distinct from navigational regulations. I should accordingly Ne ad if, subject t any comments which Colonel Ward may wish to offer, you would omit the word 'police' in these three passages, 5., With regard to Article'?, paragraph 3, the . . , + , ^ th« nuestion of vessels engaged in Company stated that, the question u • t.nn is of interest not only to the riparian river navigation is oi powers but also to His Majesty’s Government. ^eir representatives suggested that it would probably be found that nine-tenths of the tonnage engaged in river navigation , I note that this conflicts belongs to British Companies. in- - -nort-ofi 10 and 11 of tbs with the view expressed on pc^es MemorandumMemorandum which accompanied Major Young 1 s letter to Sir F. Humphrys No. S.0.145 Of the 27th of January, In order to provide that no discrimination should be exercised between the various classes of river craft it was suggested that the relevant paragraph should be re worded as follows:- 'Subject to the principles of the preceding paragraph of this article nothing shall be deemed to prejudice the power of the Board to make apeeial arrangements in respect of vessels or classes of Teasels engaged in river navigation'* This phrasing is still the subject of discussion* and X will inf ox m 5 on telegraph as soon as a decision has been reached® 6* With regard to the second sentence of Article v * the Company suggested that the words 'and/or draught should be added after 'tonnage'. They were under the impression that at present dredging dues in the Shatt-el-Arab were based on a oombination of gross tonnage and draught. Their attention was drawn to the fast that Colonel Ward had himself been responsible for the substitution of 'gross tonnage' for 'nett' in the ra'.is,;.] draft under discussion, and Sir John Baldwin emphasised the practical disadrantages of assessment by draught, especially if, as was the practice on the Danube, to® ri.er dues were amalgamated. In the first place, flat- bottomed river craft, which benefit by all the operations of the Board save dredging only, would pay an inadequate sum; secondly corrupt methods of assessment are rendered much easier: the gross or nett tonnage can be asce.tai v.vi+ ft ship’s draught is a more from the ship’s papers,rariable factor. The Company's representatires explained that they only wished that the present system should continue. I shall be glad if you will refer their suggestion, together with the riews of Sir John Baldwin, to Colonel Ward, for his observations, and make such consequent amendments in the draft as you may consider desirable. 7» The last paragraph of Article 7 is still under discussion, and I will inform you by telegraph if any amendment is considered to be desirable* 8. I shall be glad if, provided you see no objection, you would insert the following new words before the ±q&lt;q^ 7 sentence in paragraph 1 of Article 8:- 'Hot less than three months' notice shall he given to shipping bexoie any increase is made in the dues levied by the Board'. 9. You will no doubt supply me as soon as possible with a copy of the proposed schedule of dues for communication to the Anglo-Persian Oil company. XO. The Company urged that provision should be -,vu„ in Article 10 for a current independent commercial audit, and for the auditors- certificate to be annexed to the certificate returned to the High Contracting parties. Sir John Baldwin, while admitting that the suggoBvion was logically sound, thought that in practice it would give rise to difficulties and expense without achieving any useful purpose. He had found in his experience that most foreign systems of auditing were unsatisfactory, and that it was extremely costly to arrange for an audit ^ aBritish firm. fhe Company^ representatiTeB # howerer* stated that a good British firm of auditors was established in Baghdad, I should be glad to receive your views upon the Company’s suggestion. If you consider it desirable to insert a provision such as they have suggested there ie no objection, 11, I note with satisfaction the favourable report on the financial prospects of the Conservancy Board and the reorganisation of the port of Basra contained in Sir F.

Iraq must lose the bulk of her transit-trade with Persia via Basrah,, it is questionable whether Khor Musa is suitable for a modern port, unless large sums of money are spent there.

A Swedish Steamer - the ♦Delhi* is said to Be due to arrive at Khor Musa with 3000 tons of cement and some general cargo.

He said 'if Sir Francis insists I will stay and work but I am very tired and I feel that the atmosphere of heat discomfort and fatigue in which negotiations would be conducted in Baghdad in June will not be conducive to equality of settlement.' He then made a moving appeal to be permitted to have his rest after hard work of winter* The obstacle in the way of any compromiseia the direction of taking Conservancy Board negotiations separately is that he suspicious and anxious about Persian demands in Jhatt-el-Arab* He frequently referred in particular to their demands for 'Police', He ieeis that he may be forced to concede powers to the Persians m the Shatt~el~Arab which would be against the interests of Iraq a nd if he is to do this he wishes to be in position to secure some quid pro quo under other Treaty heads; for this reason he wishes to take all treaties together* This would mean a&gt;s he P Q inted out prolonged negotiations in Baghdad which could certainly ^t be completed in a week or so.

Simultaneously with receipt of your telegram No. 121, Secretaiy to the Council of Ministers called this morning with request from the Prime Minister that a message should be telegraphed to you suggesting postponement of negotiations with Persia until the autumn. Later I saw the Prime Minister who advanced the following reasons for the request. 1* he wishes to negotiate all Treaties including Conservancy Convention together in order to give widest possible field for bargaining* 2. He asserts that some of these are not yet ready, that the Persian Government have not yet seen the drafts* and that the Iraqi Ministers have had no opportomity to study them in detail. ? 3. (H.M*the King’s) representatives are ready to start work at the end of this month, negotiations are likely to be prolonged well into June when the climate will be so trying as to provide an unsuitable atmosphere for successful negotiations * 4* He says that he himself, da’far Pasha and Rustam Haidar &amp;re all ill and tired and will be incapable of conauetirg delicate negotiations immediately after strenuous Parliamentary session* He is particularly anzioursto get the Minister of Court as the Persian Representative, but he is certain that I'oymourtache will not came at this season of the yeaf\the A.Bglo- p ersian Oil, Coapany for the dredging Berviee, aad to Kia iajaaty’s Cfovernaent for capital assets, with regularity.

I sounded Sir Robert Clive on this proposal in May, 1931, but he considered that the atmosphere at that time was unfavourable. Early in the spring of this year Mr. Hoare invited me to pay him a visit to discuss the question of the Shatt-al- Arab and, at the end of February, the Persian Minister conveyed to me a definite invitation from the Shah and Teymourtache to visit Teheran after the T Nauroz 1 * 2. I left Baghdad in a Victoria of No. 70 Squadron, Royal Air Force, escorted by two Wapitis of No. 55 Squadron, on the 4th April accompanied by my wife and daughter (whose inclusion in tne invitation had heen specially asked for by Madame Teymourtaohe) aad Captain Holt - and landed at Hamadan for Hinoh. Here we were received by the Governor, tn^ Britis Vice-Consul, the senior Persian ofiicials and a b uard lined by several of honour, and the aerodrome was obviously impressed by thousands of spectators who were British military machines flying We reached Teheran at 6 p.m., where the sight of three in close formation Right Hon 1 bie Sir Philip Cunliffe-i j i ster ' , P.C;. , K.C., M.P., n .

Minister, kindly came to meet us. Although the visit was entirely informal, a guard of honour was drawn upon tie aerodrome. The same evening we were entertained to a banquet by Teymourtache at his house at which the members of the Persian Cabinet were present. Madame Teymourtache was a very vivacious hostess, and informed me that she acted as her husband ! s secretary and typist, as he refused to trust anyone else. 3. The next morning I was received in audience by the Shah, Feroughi alone being present at the interview. I apologised for my Kabuli Persian accent, but the Shah seemed gratified that I was able to talk to him without an interpreter, and we conversed with great frankness and cordiality for nearly an hour. The Shah opened the conversation by expressing his warm gratitude to Lis Majesty 1 s Government for the gentlemanly manner in which they had behaved towards ! Iraq. He bluntly remarked that generosity was rarely shown by the strong towards the weak, or by a Western to an Eastern nation, an-, &amp; brother Moslem, he was keenly appreciative tl13 ' treat ment which King Faisal and his Government had received, at our hands. He laughingly remarked, however, that he hoped that King Faisal would continue to turn to me for advice, in regard to his foreign as well as his domestic policy, and that I would prevent the wine oi independence from going to his head. keenly ^rested 4. I told His Majesty that i wa , „ +ha piddle 3ast and asked in the economic development of the l- v, v, + t-p were doing Ira&lt;1 whether he would care to know what -e . toouter world. I to improve our communications with the reminded His Majesty of his private message to me in 1930 when the work on the Rowanduz road had been temporarily stopped through lack of funds, and said I hoped that he would appreciate the progress which had been made on the 'Iraq side of the frontier during the past year. I gave the Shah a specially prepared plan of the road and informed him that more than £150,000 had already teen spent on it by f Iraci and that it would probably be opened for wheeled traffic by next winter. His Majesty remarked that he much appreciated the trouble that had been taken in bringing this important road to completion, and said that it would be the means of freeing the trade of Tabriz from the intolerable pressure which was being exerted on Northern Persia by Russia. He was obyiously delighted with the plan. he 5. I then asked whether/was interested in the Baghdad-Half a Railway project. The Shah asked me to describe the scheme and, after I had done so, he said that the idea of linking his Capital with the Mediterranean by a railway made a strong appsal him and that 1 could count on his personal support in regard to the extension of his north and south railway from Hamadan to Khanaqin, which would connect Teheran directly with Haifa. He asked me to explain the scheme in greater detail to Teymourtache. I next referred to the proposal to link Baghdad and Aleppo by air to connect with the Taurus Bxpress, as I wished to discover how the Shah regarded the cessation^ of the Junkers' service between Teheran and Bagh Majesty suddenly ejaculated ”1 watched your aeroplanes flying over the town yesterday evening ana I eo that British aircraft are the best in the world. ■in'intend to purchase them for my eountrv r ^ ^uunxry, and 1 am sure that we shall never be able to make aeroplanes in Teheran. In order to conceal the fact that the machines are made in a foreign country, x want to have a small factory in Teheran as a camouflage, where spare parts of a simple nature can be manufactured. I have spoken frankly to you as you have to me ?? . xiis Majesty went on to say that he would welcome foreign enterprise to establish temporary connection between Teheran and Baghdad by air, but intended eventually to run this line with his own pilots and machines. I made no comment, except to say that I was gratified that the British aircraft which had brought me to Teheran had made a good impression on His Majesty. After we had exchanged ideas for the placing of the friendship between Persia and ! Iraq on a permanent footing, and the Shah had recounted some anecdotes with great good humour, he invited me to a private luncheon on the day before my departure, and 1 took my leave. 6 . In the afternoon, the Persian Minister in Baghdad entertained us to a th4 dansant at the Iran Club, which was attended by about 300 guests. 1 noticed that with few exceptions the 'Persian” ladies were of European or American birth and that the emancipation of women which most 'Iraqis believe to have been aoooaplished Teheran is still at much the same stage as it is at Baghdad. This was followed by a ball at tho legation, whibh gave me a unique opportunity of meeting all the facilities of Teheran. On the 6th April, I held the urst of sine as conversations with Teymourtache and Eerougni, an^ count of which is given in another aespatofa, ternoon, the 'Iraqi Minister gave a reception honour.honour. In the evening, the Minister for Foreign Affairs entertained us to a banquet, attended by more than 100 guests, at the Iran Club. On the 7th, I lunched in the Shah's private palace, the other guests being Mr. Hoare, Teymourtache, Feroughi and Bsbairi, the Persian Minister in Baghdad. Ihe Shah was rerj affable and the oonyersation consisted ehiefly of an exchange ox courtesies and a discourse on the subject of oil. In the afternoon, the Hoyal Air Force pilots gave a short aerial display and took up a large number of Persian pilots and passengers. In company with Mr. Eoare I had another business talk vfith Teymourtache and Feroughi, and 4 days of almost continuous conviviality were concluded by amateur theatricals and a concert stage- managed by Madaaie Teymourtache at the Iran Club. On the afternoon of the 8th we were seen off at the aerodrome with the same honours as on arrival, but were forced to return the same evening to Teheran owing to engine trouble. The next morning we flew to Baghdad in 5 hours, after landing at Kermanshah. 7. From first to last I was greatly impressed by the cordiality of my reception and 1 feel that the frank exchange of views which took place on the ^abject of er 'Iraqi relations, and the personal contacts which Iwve be.n established, will be of great value to me m my worl£ at Baghdad. For all the excellent arrangements connected with this very enjoyable and instructive visit 1 am indebted to the generous consideration and hospitality of t a copy of a telegram Mr. Hoare and his stafi • * eti- sent to me by Teymourtache on my return to Baghdad 6. A copy of this despatch is being sent to die esty T s Minister at Teheran* I have, &amp;e. , (Signed) F.H.Humphrys*The 'Residency, Bagmiad. 16tn April ,1932. Mr, I have the honour to refer to my Secret despatch dated, the 15th of April, 1932, and to enclose records of two conversations which 1 held with Teymourt&amp;che and Peroughi on the 6 th and 7th of April at Teymourtache’s house at Teneraa, on the subject of per so* Iraqi relations. Each interview lasted rather less than two hours, and the report of the second Interview was kindly drafted by Mr.Hoare, who was present at Teymourtache 1 s suggestion. 2. It will be observed that Teymourtache professed a keen interest in the Baghdad-m if a Bailway project, and he gave me an assurance that, if this railway was built on the standard gauge, the Persian Government would decide to connect Teheran with the Iraqi terminus at Khanaqin with the least possible delay {5 to 8 years was mentioned) , in order to admit of a through railway service to the Mediterranean. I m unaware how much this assurance is worth, but both the Bhah and Teymourtache impressed on me that Persia could not remain indifferent to such a development and would do all in her power to assist such a notable improvement in cennrunicatlons with the western world.

At the same time, he empiiaeized the great value of informal discussions and personal contact, and said that there were two questions which he specially wished to discuss with me that day. The first of these was the draft Extradition Treaty, which he hoped would be shortly concluded with Iraq. He asked if 1 thought that the Iraqi Government would agree to treat all tribal offenders, particularly those who had rebelled against the authority of the State, as criminals subject to extradition, and lie felt that the term 'political offender' as applied to sucn persons was a meaningless expression. 1 replied that he had toadied on the point which my experience snowed was the chief stumbling block in the negotiation of all extradition treaties. These treaties provided that a political offender was not subject to extradition, and tne difficulty always was to define exactly wuat political offender* meant. The Iraqi Government wouK- doubtl • have’ to take into consideration the susceptU Hit ofa of their tribesmen and the traditional laws of asylum wfdch possessed a quasi-religious significance. There was the practical difficulty also that, if a neighbouring State was to hand over a political offender who had taken refuge in its territory , such persons would in future be mu.cn more difficult to lay hands on and mi git cause still greater embarrassment than they do under the present tribal custom which was well understood and was not in conflict with international law. Teymourtache said he appreciated the force of this argument, but would ask the Iraqi Government if they would agree to a fro a teller zone witidn which no political offender would be allowed to reside. The second question he wished to discuss was that of the Shatt-sl-Arab, and he ceiled on Feroughi to make a statement. Peroughi then made an impassioned appeal to me to back Persia's claim to sovereignty over half the channel, or in otner words to make the 'thalweg' of the main stream the boundary where Persia owned the opposite bank. 1 said that I taught it would be a very inconsiderate demand to make on a you;® btate to surrender any par o of the sovereign rights which it had inherited from the Ottoman Empire, particularly as the vexed question of the boundary had recently been settled by agreement. I proposed an alternative solution by widen Persia would obtain all the practical advantages she I desired wlfciiout wounding Iraq's sruour propre. I propounded the scheme by which the British, icreias Iraqi Governments should each appoint a meuber Conservancy Board, which would control the navlgatio the waterway. Teymourtache finally accepts solutionas far as iiaraadan, and tiiat when namadan was reached the railway would branch southwards to mzful and the Persian Gulf end westwards to Kermanshah and Khanaqin. provided that the funds could be made available the whole scheme could be completed in 8 years. e added that the linking of Teheran by a standard gauge railway to the Mediterranean would usher in the dawn of Persia's economic independence and would transform and develop the country as nothing else could do. 1 said that I would quote his assurance in London when the question of the gauge came up for consideration and I hope that his optimism would be Justified by events. For myself, I considered that a through railway service from the first- class port of Haifa to Baghdad and Teheran would be one of the gsateet economic benefits that could be conferred on the Middle East. The easiest way of building the Persian sector of this line was, in my opinion, to begin from the Khanaqin end and construct towards Kermanshah and Hamadaa, where a junction could be made with the C aspian-Per sian Gulf Railway. Teymourtache promised to think this over and asked me not to forget tiiat Persia desired to be a partner in thiafereat enterprise. (Sd) F.H.

Teymourtache opened the coriTersation with a general disquisition on world affairs; in his opinion no country was sufficient unto itself; politics in the old-fashioned sense had ceased to exist and the policy of allcountries was inevitably controlled by economic considerations; above all it waw essential to liquidate all outstanding issues with neighbouring States in order to be able to develop the national economy in peace. These considerations applied to Persia with greater force than perhaps anywhere else and it was for this reason that Persia had been especially glad to settle her outstanding issues with Turkey. Persia*s eyes were now directed to the West rather than to the ^ast and she was in urgent need of alternative outlets for her products, the Russian route being exposed to a variety of inconveniences. .’his afforded me an opportunity of extracting from Teymourtache a very categorical statement that the Persian Government had every intention of building the Tehran - Hamadan - lOianaqin line ’.'.xth standard gauge.

I said that I had made no study of this particular point and that I imagined that the reasons which had guided the Frontier Commiasion would he found in the proces-rerbaux. /ith regard to the Ghatt-el-Aran, after Perough! had suggested that here again the Oommiasion had departed from the normal and good practice, &amp;nd x had refuted his arguments, Teymourtache said that it did not seem necessary to discuss matters oi principle territorial claims because there seemed every reason to hopehope that the matter could be settled on a purely practical basis by the constitution of a Tripartite Conservancy board, thus reaffirming his statement to me on the previous day and to Mr. Hoare (see Tehran telegram Ko. 11 of 12/2/32 to *.Q.) I gaT , thea a general idea of stoat was required and explainedthat the matter was highly technical it was very desirable that the Persian negotiator should actually visit the Shatt-el*Arab* is'or a moment Teymourtache toyed with the idea that he and J’eroughi should rim downbefore hing i/eisill’s visit* Having realised that this was impossible if only on the score of time he thought the matter would have to wait until after the visit* After 1 had laid stress on the fact that time was rather previous, as it would soon be getting unpleasantly hot at Baghdad, Mt.Koare suggested that the Persian Government might well depute somebody to go over the ground at once and after some discussion it wasagreed that 1 should arrange for thelraqGovernment to issue an invitation in this sense wh ere up o nt h e Persian Governmentwould depute the American Engineer, Carroll, toyisit Iraq and make a study of the situation under the auspices of Colonel Teymourtache tooh a note in writing of the principal points requiring settlement; it is noteworthy th-xt definitelyagreed that all lighting and buoying should be placed, under the board and also that he appeared to see no objection to the Board's powers extending three miles up the iXarun in purely Persian territorial 1 laid considerable stress on tne potential superiority of liohammerah over that of B&amp;ndei ses no objaction to tne i/oar miles up the Aarun in purely 1 laid considerable stres superiority of Mohammerah ovei as a port in the broad sense othat the Persian Government would very probably not have embarked on the Khor Musa Scheme at all had there been at the time any real prospect of coming to terras with Iraq over uhe ohatt*'*el**iire»o• JLs there was not| the Persian Government had felt a natural reluctance to bring their railway to a teiminus the approaches to which were entirely alien hands, is matters now stood he thought there was a useful future for both ports* Throughout the discussion I made it clear, and Teymourtache professed fully to appreciate it, that I could not negotiate with the Persian Government over the heads or behind the back of the Iraq Government;what I could and would do was to do my best to ensure that the Iraq Government would approach any issues raised by thqPersians in a reasonable and conciliatory spirit* ,xf ter the meeting was over I told hr .Ho are that I had deliberately abstained from mentioning to the Persians the article under itdch the Iraq Government would be empowered to denounce the Convention in the event of tonnage using the Persian ports of bhatt-el- Arab fall hog below three and a half million tons, ve agreed that an article of this nature would be offensive to Persian susceptibilities and really of no practical value; moreover if it were included ana if the Convention were denounced by Iraq the first result would be that Persia would revive the territorial issue which we hoped the Convention would bury for good and all.

Dear Clauson, I understand that Marker of the Board of Trade has written you a letter, corresponding to one numbered M. 5297/32 of the 18th April which he wrote to Baxter, enclosing a copy of a memorandum by Captain Brandon on the Persian Gulf lights. Captain Brandon evidently does not agree with Colonel Ward. conce rning the necessity- for lights on Pas Mutax and the Farur Shoal; and as Persia does not lay claim to the Quoins, and as her claim to Tamb is unlikely to be established, i&gt;he position seems to be that for the purposes of general naviga tion there are at most two lights which might be affected by an eventual transfer to the Persian Government of the pra control of the Persian lighting system. Of these, one Jask light - is undoubtedly on Persian territory, but stated by Colonel Ward not to be essential to the navigati - the Kais Island light,- is of the trade route, while the other, • J *Clauson, Esq.is essential for the trade route, but may possibly be outside Persian waters. I agree with Marker that it would be interesting to know whether it is a fact that the Kais Island light has been moved outside Persian territorial waters. Me should therefore be grateful if, provided you see no objection, you could take the necessary steps to find out from Biscoe what is now the true position of this light. I ought perhaps to add that when I was at Abadan myself at the end of February, I discussed the question of the Persian coast lights with Elkington ox the Anglo- Pereian Oil Company, and derived the definite impression from him that these lights were of the greatest importance to the shipping of his company, who were much disturbs the possibility of their falling under purely Peioian control and becoming neglected and unreliable* I am sending a copy of this to Marker.B Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted Reference to previous correspondence: Letter io from the Office of the Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

Teymourtache asserted that Mohanxnerah under this scheme would be developed as a port in addition to Khor Musa and that Persian Government would probably not have embarked on Khor Musa scheme at all had there been at any time any real prospect of coining to terms with Iraq over Shatt-el-arab. I deliberately refrained from alluding to possible denunciation described in ilrticle 24 as my discussion with Teymourtache made it clear that this article would be offensive to Persian susceptibilities and of little practical value since if convention were denounced by Iraq? Persians would certainly revive territorial issue. Hoar© agreed with me that negotiations would probably break down if right of denunciation were insisted on. I discussed this point yesterday with King Tiiaal and Prime Minister and they agreed that clause providing for denunciation b King of Iraq might be omitted if Persians objected.

Dear Clauson, « ^ f b With reference to your letter of the 24th March (P. Z. 1842/32) enclosing copy of a letter from Baxter about the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf, we have looked into the points raised in Colonel Ward’s letter of the 21st November and I now enclose copy of a Memorandum by Captain Brandon on this subject for your consideration. We should very much like to know how the Kais Island Lightvessel can be considered to be outside 18th April, 1932. ^ -^O territorial waters, and we should be glad of your observations on this point as the Lightvessel is, as will be seen from Captain Brandon’s Memorandum, of ccnsiaera importance to shipping. I am writing in similar terms to Baxter at the Foreign Office. iauson, Bsq.. Yours sincerely,Persian gulf ..J £9 J .? Ab l l^Z...of transfer to Per.lA of ^ navigation in PQPsiati 'fesrpitory . Brom the first enclosure to Colonel Ward's letter of 8 th January, 1931, (paper 'A' of correspondence obtained from India Office) it appears that the lights ; lighthouses, lightships, buoys and beacons in Persian territory, as at 1st January 1931, maintained by the Persian Gulf Lighthouse Service, were as follows:- Bushire. 2 fixed lights (exhibited on Residency flagstaff). 2 lighted buoys. 3 unlighted buoys. Kais Island. Henjam Kishm. Bandar Abbas Jask. 1 light vessel. 1 flashing light (on an iron pillar) 1 fixed light (on telegraph building). 1 unlighted buoy. 1 lighted buoy. 1 unlighted buoy. 1 group flashing light (in the tower of a building). 1 unlighted buoy. (I have compared Colonel Ward's list with the Admiralty publications and slightly amplified and amended his description to make the cnaracter lights, etc., clearer.) Of these aids to navigation there are only two which are of benefit to general navigation, i.a. to vessel Gulf. &amp;s distinct from proceeding straight up or down tne Gui , vessels calling at intermediate ports These two areiq&lt;y (a) Kais Island light vessel, which is of (b) benefit solely to general navigation, and J&amp;sk light, which, altnough mainly of value to vessels calling at Jask,is of some benefit also to general navigation in that vessels proceeding up and down the Gulf may in some eases use it as a point of landfall or departure. A fairly complete list of the aids to navigation in the Gulf is contained in the Appendix to India Office paper ('F' in M.8084/30). In addition to Kais Island light vessel, the lights on Tunb Island and Little Quoin Island are of great benefit to general navigation. I do not know whether the territorial status of these two Islands can be regarded as definitely settled, but, from my knowledge of political conditions in the Persian Gulf, I should have expected that Persia would certainly lay claim to Tunb, and possibly to Little Quoin also. Colonel Ward, however, as he does not include them in his list, evidently does not regard either of the Islands as Persian territory, and perhaps he has some authority for this view. As regards the statement of the Political Resident to which Colonel Ward refers in document 34, to the effect that Kais Island light vessel is outside territorial waters, this is not borne out by the Admiralty chart, which shews the light vessel as bei g only about 1* miles from the coast. It would be desirable that this point should be cleared up. As pointed out by the Political Resident in his letter of the 6th May, (paper 'b')&gt; Colonel Ward has rather confused the whole issue by introducing estimates of cost etc, a number of aids to navigation /whichwhich do not fit pnssont Gxi ^ t -«m, exist and are very unlikely to materialise in the near future. With regard to Colonel Ward 1 s statements regarding the dangers and difficulties of navigation in the Gulf, on which the Political Resident comments in the same letter, I can only say that in 1921/1925 I was in command of one of H*M«ships of the Persian Gulf Division and for a great part of the time acted as Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf, and it would never have occurred to me to describe the navigation of the regular routes in these waters as particularly difficult. None of the masters of merchant vessels running regularly to ports in the Gulf whom X met complained seriously of anything except the climate, and I was struck by the great regularity with which these services were maintained. If the purely local aids to navigation at Bushire, Hen jam, Kishm and Bandar Abbas given in the list at the beginning of this note were handed over to Persia, and, as is probable, not efficiently maintained, the considerable amount of British shipping calling at intermediate ports in the Gulf would be gravely affected. Colonel Ward dismisses rather summarily the claims of this class of shipping to consideration. Admittedly the interests concerned are small compared with those of the shipping proceeding direct to Abadan and Basra but nevertheless their claims are by no means negligible. To sum up, the vital aids to navigation for vessels proceeding up and down the Gulf are Little Quoin and Tunb Island lights and Kais Island light vessel. It seems desirable to ascertain with certainty which of these (if any) are in Persian territory. The aids to navigation which are /undoubtedlyundoubtedly In Persian territory are of secondary importance only but serve a very useful purpose at, I should imagine, a comparatively small cost. X have been unable to find any figures of the cost of maintenance of Little Quoin or Tunb Island lights or of Kais Island li.ght vessel, but the two former are fully manned lighthouse stations and must represent the heaviest item in the annual bill for the maintenance of the Persian Gulf lights.

Teymour talked at considerable length and I fancy very inaccurately about the practical inconvenience of the Haft-Khan eh oilfield being on both sides of the frontier. He also talked at great length about ^obligation to settle all 'Iraqi outstanding questions before finally giving up the mandate. I said, as I had said before, that by settling he seemed to mean that we should induce Iraq to give up a chunk of her territory. When he proceeded to maintain that such a frontier rectification would be in ’Iraq's best interests, I said that in effect there were two difficulties to overcome. He first of all would have to convince Sir Francis Humphrys that this was really the case, which I felt sure would be difficult, and then - what would 'be far more difficult - supply^with arguments which would convince the Iraqis. I felt quite sure that a three-day visit would not 'be enough. Teymour laughed and said he quite agreed 'but would keep the matter for King Faisal’s visit. (a definite invitation to King Faisal to come on April 25th. went down by yesterday’s air mail). With regard to the Shatt-el-Arab I told him, when he raised the question, that itmight well be to the advantage all three of us to come to some definite arrangement.tfce Secretary of Sta w id for the Colonies.

In discussing this question of lighting and buoying in connexion with the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board proposals, we have, I think, proceeded moie less on the tacit assumption that the lights on th Persian coast were of the utmost importance not o y to the comparatively small volume ol shipping at Persian ports, but also to ships using the trade route up and down the Gull from the Sha Arab. It seems, however, from Colonel yard s as though the trade route was even at present comparatively Clauson, Esqcomparatively little affected ly tlie lighting arrangements on the Persian coast, and might he made completely independent of it hy placing two lights outside territorial waters. The point seems to he of considerable importance in any attempt to estimate the risks to which British shipping might he exposed if Persia were ever to gain exclusive control of her own lighting and huoying system, and it occurs to me that you may possibly consider it worth while to obtain the observations of the Board oi Trade on Colonel Ward’s letter.(£) / ^ Karch # 1952* r ear With reference to your letter 96448/32 of 24th shout the Shatt el Arab Conservancy Convention, we agree frith your proposal to give the high Commissioner the discretionary authority asked for in paragraph 5 of his despatch of the 11 th December* Copies of this letter are being sent to frlckett, Hancock, - lauson and houell* Tours c olonial » &amp;sq.

On the assumption that this port will continue to carry out these duties I estimate, in view of that 1 write below, that the reduced cost in the working of the Persian Gulf lighting Service as at present will be approximately Bs.25 to 50,000 per annum.

The latter are represented as having referred to the Abadan anchorage as Persian water - 'the stretch of deco water known as the %ieu d f Ancr&amp;ge* which, under th® Treaty of ^rzerum, constituted Persian national waters . 11 This appears to be an echo of a claim cut forward ten years ago by th® Aiigl ©-Persian Oil Company with the object of securing the exclusion of the ri ort of Abadan from the limits of the r &gt;ort of Basrah as defined in a notification issued under the Port of Tasrah Proclamation of 1^1^* A copy of the correspondence that passed on the subject between this High Commie lesion and the Company at the time round whatever for ^ the 1 Iraq-Persian frontier does no t follow the low waterwater line on the Per.ian tank at Abadan, -mere , a , eren some lieousaion aa to whether the Jetties, built out beyond the low water i in* a tr liae oould Properly be regarded “ t,er3i&amp;n territ0ry ' ftnd d bel ieve still a moot nointa 1 aFn S0TT y mt to have drawn attention to this before; it has little bearing as a matter of fact on the question which Hall was discussing with the representa tives of the A*%10-Per®ian Oil Company, but as the ^erso- * Iraq frontier on the 3h&amp;n«&amp;l-arab is rather coming into the liiae light at ore sent in view of the coming negotiations with Persia, it seems advisable to scotch at once any suggestion that the anchorage at Abadan is Persian water* Yours sincerely, Hubert Young**8 foreshadowed in Sir J. Cadman'e utter to B . of the 20th August, Mr. Hearn and Sir Ba a ii Kemball-Cook oallaO to see me yesterday morning. ihey explained that the object of their visit was really two-fold. In the first place, they wished to disouss the question of the A.P.t.C's dredging loan agreement with the Iraqi Government in relation to our proposals for the establishment of a Gone#ryanoy Board in the Arab* Secondly t they wished to diecuss certain Cuatoms difficulties that had arisen with the Iraqi Govermi.ent. They told me that, acting upon the advice in our latter of 24th August, they proposed to initiate negotiations for the revision of their agreement with the Iraqi Government immediately upon th© iort Director 1 © return to Iraq. fhey had already produced a tentative draft as a 'basis of negotiation, and this they had shown to Colonel v&amp;rd, with whom, they had a long tali. is a result of this talk they were now much more sympathetically disposed than they had previously been towards his suggestion for an increased loan to finance the purchase of a third dredger. This would mean, they explained, putting up a further 2100 , 000 , and so large a suit* of money wan not easily come by in these days; hut they now realised that it was in their own interests to secure that the dredging scheme wae not liable to interruption o ing to &amp;osiQ accident to one of the existing two dredgers, and that something must be done, either by the provision of e third dredger or the establishment of a money reserve for the dredging scheme, to guard against temporary interruptionI interruption. They would, thm v ' t,a ® y eald » now go into ths financial aspect very olosalir , * ^oeeiy ano nee what eould bg to meet Golonal Ward 1 s wi.«hee. They came armed with a long ll at of queetione to put in regard to our propo» a l a for the Oow.rmnoy Boar a. But m order to avoid wasted labour, 1 thought it better to let them see, in strict confidence, our draft Conservancy Convention. l-hey read through the draft carefully and raised a number of tinor points in regard to which I was able to satisfy them. 1 'hey were on the whole very isTournbiy j.mpr©ss©d • ? rb.c only oritioia® of nny au.bst-ii.ioe they had to fflafco rolatod to draft Article 15 and the proposal that the Conssrranoy Board should assume liability lor a proportion of the capital debt of th© iort to Hi© Majesty*a Government. Here, they suggested that, in order to furesta.ll Fersian criticism, th# amount of th© debt to be transferred to the Co ns errancy Board should be more closely related to the value of th© Port assets to be handed over to th® Board, ffeey thought that if the transfer of assets and th© transfer of capital debt were represented a© entirely disconnected operation^, th© latter would be bitterly opposed by the Persian Government and also would com# in for criticism elsewhere, finally, they asiced that the A.l, u.G. should be given an opportunity to examine the draft further before it was adopted as a basis for negotiation with the Iraqi aha Persian G-overnnants# Discussion then turned to th© Company s oustoass difficulties with the Iraqi Government, These, they explained, primarily arose from the fact that the •- 011 of ■ badan was too small to accomodate all their shipping* dome of their vessel© had to be moored in 1 * aqi Wa althoughalthough the^ had moored as ^ vesael8 ae ooula be accommodated in the etretch of deep water known ae the -Lieu d» mcrage« which, under the Treaty of iraerimi, constituted xersiaa national waters. fhe vessels in question consisted of a few small craft used exclusively in plying between Abadan and to hammer ah, carrying supplies for the Company, and a floating dock, which latter was moored just within Iraqi waters. Hone of the former vessels ever entered the fort of Basra proper, but they all, including those normally moored in the Lieu dV,norage had to pass through Iraqi waters in the course of their trips between Abadan and h»:o hammerah* The Customs Director at nasra claimed that all these vessels should pay to the Iraqi Government transit dues in respect of the cargo that they carried. He also claimed that full Customs import duty of lb per cent should be paid in respect of the values of the craft, including the floating dock, actually moored in Iraqi waters. The Company had hitherto declined to pay any of these imposts and, acting it was understood on the advice of the Ministry of Finance the Custom© Director had not as yet seriously pressed his claims* I explained that, ©o far ae 1 could see, the action of the Director of Cue tome was in accordance pith Iraqi law. She Iraqi Gorermaent proposed, bowers ■, to so soon as the financial position abolish all transit dues of Iraq permitted, and there was some reason to hope that when the Iraqi iarliaffiont met these dues might disappear again. If so, that particular difficulty wou^. be resolved. is regard© value of the craf t themselves * It seemed to »e that it mightmight be possible to draw a distinotlon between ths float lag dooic which was admittedly permanently moored m Iraqi waters and the small ri W craft whose presence in those waters might be regarded as mor. or less fortuitous. I suggested that it might be possible to compromise wlth the Iraqi Customs authorities on the basis of paying fuU import duty on the value of the dock, and In return obtaining exemption in respect of the other craft. '■ir ^®®ball-&gt;cook expressed the view that this was a reasonable euggesticn, and both h@ and Mr. Hearn undertook to go into it with the Company*s appropriate officials* They said that they would write to the Colonial Office officially on the subject of their Customs difficulties and might than put forward the suggestion that I had made for a compromise. They would probably ask for our assistance with the Iraqi Government. (Higned} J, H.

As regards the first point, we doubt if the time has yet come to Inform the shipowner® of the position. It is true that the proposal to entrust the Conservancy Board with the lighting and buoying of the Julf has now been accepted by the various departments of His Majesty s Government, and, since you wrote your letter, by the The next stage is to approach the Iraqi Government of India.Iraqi Government cm the Shatt~el~Arafc proposals as a whol®. If they agree, the Persian government will then be approached, and Sir F. Humphrys will probably endeavour, during his visit to Tehran on April 4th, to persuade the Persians to send someone of sufficient standing to Bagdad to negotiate the convention. Briefly we shall not know where we stand with the Iraqis and the Persians for at least some weeks. On the second point, 1 have not been able to consult ir Frederick Butler, who is ill. I understand, however, that when he took the chair during the negotiations with the Chamber of Shipping some ye^is ag0 , it was merely because Persian U jhUn.; and buoying repreeented at that time a liJ &gt;” olu ‘ I ie un the Foreign Office votes.

Under the draft Convention as it now stands, the Board has jurisdiction in respect of certain defined matters within a certain defined geographical area, and in matters within the scope of its jurisdiction its jurisdiction is exclusive. m the other hand its jurisdiction is not exclusive in respect of all matters occurring within the defined geographical area, but only in respect of particular functions which are entrusted to it within that area. Outside thegeographical area it has no Jurisdiction at all. It', therefore, jetties not forming part of a port are placed outside the geographical area, the Board has no jurisdiction at all over vessels moored to such jetties, except that it any enforce regulations for the purpose of securing the eafity of life » nd property afloat. In other words, such jetties will i&gt;e placed in the Mae position liE^XiS the Board as a proper port and the Board would have no control over the construction of new jetties. thle u0 * 6 not seem to us to he d eslrahle. e think that the Board ought to have more jurisdiction over the se odd jetties than over proper porte. On the other hand, the same fact that the Board has jurisdiction over such jetties does not mean taat its jurisdiction is exclusive in respect ox all matxerx which occur at such jetties; and in particul-'.r the jurisdiction of the Board would not exclude jurisdiction or the duty oi the . . _ T such as the Opium enforce intei*natxotial conConvention* It would i&gt;e wrong to suppose that, if these jetties included within the Jurisdiction of the Board, the territorial powers would lose their jurisdiction to enforce Opium Conventions etc* at these jetties* The upshot of the two preceding paragraphs is, we think:, that no amendment is required in the words and u which form part of a port 1 *, although we should be fully prepared to reconsider the question in the light ox any observations which Bagdad may wish to put forward in the light, of their local knowledge and experience* More over, we do not think it necessary for any provision to be made in the convention either for the enforcement or for the observance by the Board of International Agreements and Conventions* Sir John Baldwin has, however, x*aised a new point alx&gt;ut Article 2. He thinks it would he better it the Bead hod some control over the construction oi jetties not forming part of a port. If the nanube Cohesion had not possessed such control, jetties would have been constructed—constructed which would seriously have interfered with navigation# He suggests therefore that, if local conditions do not rentier such a stipulation unnecessary, the words n and hy the Board 5 * should he added after the words H riparian authorities* 1 • We think that this suggestion could usefully he put to Bagdad at an early date# Finally, Sir John Baldwin has drawn our attention to the inclueioa In Article 6, at the instance of BagM, of the word ^navigation 11 amongst the functions of ‘-he oaru* Bagdad have not adduced any justification for the inclusion of this word, and he is in some doubt as to its meaning. He suggests that if it means control of navigation, this seeas to be provided for in the same paragraph by the words “enforcement of navigational, *police and sanitary regulations. 5 I am sending copies of this letter to ri^^ett, Hancock, Peirsc, Clauson and If ©well#Cc/iuNhst l/aa. cc^ Before 1909 the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf had been left to private enterprise. Between 1909 and 1914 a reconstruction of the limits and buoys was carried out by H.M.G. throu^i the Government of India. Between 1914 and 1925 the service was expanded and various new limits and buoys added. This was still done by H.M.G. and the Government of India jointly, and expenditure was shared. After the war H.M.G. were anxious to divest themselves of financial commitments, and an arrangement was made whereby the Government of India continued to administer the service without control from home, revenue being raised by light dues collected at Basra and Abadan. This arrangement still continues. The Government of India are assisted by an Advisory Committee composed of representatives of companies (chiefly the A.P.O.C.) whose ships mainly navigate the Gulf. Since 1927 the Basra Port Directorate have been employed by the Government of India as contractors for the upkeep of the lights and buoys (before then the Government of India did it themselves through the R.I.M.S. 'Lawrence'). The Port Directorate run a ship which actually maintains the lights. For many years the Persians have shown signs of wishing to take over the lights and buoys on the Persian side of the Gulf, or at any rate to obtain nominal control of them. It is, of course, mainly a matter of national!an and 'face', as the Persians have neither the experience nor ' si j 1 the means for maintaining lights and buoys. So long ago as 1913 there was difficulty with the Persians on the question of control, but it has become acute of recent years: in fact, the Persian Government were informed xn 1930 that H.M.G. were/were prepared to have a small conference of representatives of Iraq, Persia and Great Britain (with India) to discuss the question of lighting and buoying in the Gulf, and it was recognised that it would not be possible to prevent some sort of Persian co-operation in thepaintenance of the service, at any rate on the Persian side of the Gulf, indefinitely. Meanwhile, in 1929 Colonel Ward, the Director of the Basra Port Authority, suggested that the Conservancy Board which it was hoped to form by agreement between Great Britain, Persia and Iraq for the control of navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab should be charged with the superintendence of the lighting and buoying throughout the Gulf. This suggestion has been under discussion on and off ever since, and Colonel Biscoe in June 1930, in commenting on it, said that two objections had been advanced to it - (1) the risk of Persian and Iraqi delegates combining and taking control out of the hands of the British, (2) that the Arab Sheikhs would not have any representation on the Board, and might resent the Persians having any control over lights on the n rab coast. In order to get round these objections, he suggested that there should be two Boards, j*? Goiwnitt&amp;e A would be in charge of lighting and buoying arrangements in the Shatt-el-Arab and on the Persian Coast; Somaittoo B would deal with the Arab Coast. Both A and B would have a British chairman. A would have a Persian representative, B one or two Arab representatives. The Government of India in commenting said: 'From the purely administrative point of view the Government of India see no advantage in having two Boards ... but as the proposal is calculated to overcome the political difficulty in regard to the Arab representation/representation, they are prepared to agree to the Resident’s proposal for the creation of two _Boards^ ^ SukoptoMf preparations for the negotiation of a Perso- Iraqi treaty before the termination of the Iraq mandate have been pressed forward, and a draft Convention for a Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board is now complete. The question of the Gulf limiting and buoying in relation to this draft Convention has been discussed at several inter departmental meetings. The view has been expressed strongly by the Iraq High Commission that it is essential for Great Britain to be represented on the Conservancy Board, in view of the necessity of keeping control over the Shatt-el-Arab. The transfer of administration of the Persian Gulf lights to the Board would be a very strong argument in favour of British participation, as H.M.G. are responsible for the lights, at any rate on the Arab side of the Gulf. On the other hand, they deprecate very strongly the suggestion that there should be two Committees. It would be cumbrous and difficult to work from a practical and financial point of view; the Arab Rulers have never taken an interest in or contributed to the service, and there seems to be no point in introducing representatives of than at this stage. If there is no Persian representative on the Committee dealing with the Arab side, it would be difficult to insist that there should be a British representative on the Committee dealing with the Persian side. In any case, both Committees would have to be subject to the control of the Board, which would contain a Persian member. It is most desirable to conclude the Convention quickly before the termination of the mandate, and complicated provisions for Sub-Conanittees might prolong and impede negotiations. In fine, the Imperial Departments agreed that the Government of India and the/'H I i! y I the Resident should be urged to drop the two-Committee scheme and agree to the transfer of the administration of the service to the Board, as such, consisting of a British, a Persian and an Iraqi representative. This has been put to the Resident and the Government of India. Colonel Biscoe agrees that if there is now no serious risk of the Persians and Iraqis combining to oust the British, and if for all practical purposes the status qup will be preserved and effective control will be exercised by the British representatives, as at present, then there is no objection to the service being transferred to the proposed Conservancy Board. As to Colonel Biscoe f s provisos, it is intended to appoint a British representative of outstanding ability and experience to the Board, and the I i Imperial Departments are apparently satisfied that he will be the only member who really has experience and will be able i in practice to control the Board. As they are satisfied regarding the vital Shatt-el-Arab communications, there appears to be no reason for real apprehension regarding the lighting service. It is expected that the Basra Port Authority will continue to act as contractors, and^in fact the machinery of maintenance will be the same as before. The administrative control will merely be transferred from the Government of India to the Board. The Government of India in their telegram of the 7th March agree without qualification to the elimination of the two-Committee proposal. It is therefore proposed to inform the Colonial Office that we agree. The matter is very urgent, as Sir Francis Humphrys wishes to start his discussion of the draft Convention with the Iraq Government to-day, and not willing to do so until all points have been settled.

Secondly, it was agreed that the proposal in paragraph 5 of iiumparys* despatch of December 11th, in which he asks for authority to agree at his discretion to an amendment in Article 24 of the draft nnatv* i*Arab Conservancy : card Convention, might be left for further consideration at our leisure, since .there seemed no nurry in sending instruct ions to : aRdad on this point.1 now write to eat that we agree with humphrys that it ie quite liKely that the l ereians, or even the Iraqis may wian to introduce an amendment in Article 24 whereby the Conventlonntght be denounced in consequence' of British interests in the ghatUel.Arab dimiiiisiiing. it might even be suggested that British paru cipation ir the cona ol of the nhiatt* ol.Arab should come to an e:id if the volume ol r itlsh siiipping should decrease in proportion to ti»at of the siilpping of other foreign countries. . ut it is difficult to know precisely in witat form the question is likely to be raised.

MAR 1332 Dear Hail, With reference to your letter of 26th February, 96448/32, we agree that Humphrys should be authorised to communicate the revised text of the Shatt-el-Arab draft Conservancy Board Convention to the Iraqi Government with the reservations J you mention. I have already informed ' Pedier in this sense. 2. Meanwhile I am afraid the is one fresh point in this connection that we feel needs clearing up. So far as we understand, the intention is that the Conservancy i Board should take over the lighting and buoying service in the Guli and run it entirely, viz. that the Government of India, as being at present de facto responsible for the service, should request the Board to relieve them of all duties and responsibilities, financial and otherwise. This certainly scans to be Cadman’s idea, and the Foreign Office and Humphrys also seem'to have such an arrangement in mind, 5. If so, the wording of Article 5, last paragraph, does not seem to make the position clear. In its original fom it provided Imerely for the collection of dues by the Board; in its present amended fom it provides for maintenance and collection of dues, but implies that the Board will only act as Agent for some continuing M authority or authorities responsible for lighting and buoying' which would still retain financial and administrative control. Tills authority could only be the Government of India or the Government of India 0 iu 3 the Persian Government, the latter in so far as the Persian coast is concerned. *41 4. It will probably be best/to wait and see what the Government of India say in reply to our telegram oi 26th February - we have had Colonel Biscoe’s reply but nothing so far from India - but in the meantime you may care to take up with Humphrys the question of what exactly is intended by the amendment now provisionally adopted, and suggest that if the idea is to take the whole business out of the Govt.of India’s hands, a better wording would be something on these lines ' controlled by the Board, or at the request of such authority or authorities to take over and maintain such lights and buoys....' I am sending copies of this • „to Baxter, Hancock, Tricketb pAirsn 3110 Howell.448/32. ,Q (ZSl : \ ^ i_c t\.. ; v. j J February, 1932 Dear Clauson. You have, I understand, received a copy of Baxter f s semi-official letter to Flood of the B3rd of February (E. 827/20/34) about the Shatt-el-Arab. We are not acting on the suggestion in that letter that copies of the revised text of the. Conservancy Convention should be sent out to Baghdad by to-day’s air mail, because in point of fact Sir Francis Humphrys took away with him a copy of the draft Convention in the form in which it emerged from our conference on the 12th February, and in the circumstances it does not seem worth while running the risk of sending out a very secret document through a channel of doubtful safety. We do, however, whole-heartedly agree with everything Baxter says in his letter as to the importance of placing Humphrys in a position to take the Iraqi Government into his confidence and to obtain their CUd soh, esq.their general concurrence in the draft Convention at the earliest possible moment. In view, therefore, of the considerations of urgency explained in Baxter T s letter, we propose, if you agree, to telegraph to Humphrys authorising him to communicate the revised text (subject to one or two corrections or minor alterations which have been recommended since the draft record of the conference was circulated) to the Iraqi Government forthwith and to discuss its terms with them. We should, however, ask him, when doing so, to make it clear to the Iraqi Government that certain articles in the draft Convention,and notably Article 5, are still under consideration and are liable to further alteration. I mentioned this proposal to you on the telephone and you later informed me that the India Office would see no objection. I am only writing to you now to give y&gt;u an opportunity to confirm this and to put the matter on a regular footing. With regard to the penultimate paragraph of Baxter’s letter, ’’reclamation, erection and excavation” is the correct rendering, and the final version of the recordHH record of the meeting, which will be circulated so soon as all Departmental comments have been received, r will be amended accordingly. The phrase is taken from the Baghdad memorandum, of which a copy was sent to you in my letter of the 15th of February. I am writing in similar terms to Hancock, frickett, Peirse and Howell, and am sending a copy to Baxter. sincerely.

The fact is that the exam is utterly unsubstantial, and though it in made much of fey the • ersian Mationalist eress (probably for the most oart under official inspiration), it seers to have been put forward largely as a bargaining; counter with a view to obtaining compensation* for its sufesenuent. relinquishment; the Persi&gt;m Government say that they must have something to show for it m order to reconcile the public to its abandonment* Our attitude has been that we regard the claim as preposterous, but sines it has been put forward with m much publicity, it would im difficult to avoid saying something about it m a treaty designed to cover all outstanding questions* it is desirable (on the whole) to conclude a general treaty with Persia if possible, both in order to clear up other specific matters in dispute which rest on a more solid basis, also, of course, in the hope of strengthening our influence at Tehran and putting ourselves on an eqial footing with hussia.

Sir Francis Humphrys was present and ail the interested departments were represented. The meeting spent three hours in going through, clause by clause, the c.rait J Convention (flagged). Most of the clauses and amendments do not concern the India Oixice at oil directly, and the minutes, when received, will show the changes made. Sir Francis Humphry s^brought with him a memorandum (a copy immediately below) giving the view! of the Iraq High Commission on the various clauses and the amendments proposed by Sir John Cadrnan and the I Foreign Office. The memorandum had not been circuiataB and was only read out at the meeting.

The portion oi the Iraq memorandum which particularly concerns tne India Office is on pages 7 to 0. Sir Francis Humphrys and the Colonial Office were very emphatic that in order to secure British participation in the proposed Conservancy Board, which is naturally regarded as most important from the Imperial point of view, it is most desirable to make the Board responsible for the lighting and buoying service in the Persian Gulf because there would then be a very strong argument for British participation^in f view of the preponderant proportion of British shipping the Gulf and Sbatt-el-Arab (about 96 per cent/^the fact that lighting and buoying has up U date been entirely carried out by the British and^the fact that the British representative would represent the interests ox the Arab Rulers in the Gulf. Sir Francis _ d the Colonial Office were also very emphatic that L/ ol fin - ««i - /.*/ / U Colonel Biacoe's (’two-decker' scheme was and would not work. - xhe general sense of the meeting that it WM undesirable to complicate the ^negotiatione .ith the Persians by trying to incorporate in the Con,„tim,*ei.borat, t.o-Co-uttee em, .h,,, lr . f, ct the Briti8h nsnbcr of the •embe ^ ' &gt;Uld '' 1 ‘' 0St csrtalnl y b » the cniy “b o' “ “ ^ dealing •** 9Ubi “ lS « neguiatione, lightingjjinute Paper- Department. 115* 3000 10/31 and buoying etc. and that he would be choaen with that end in view; ■Hu? mirminiouo .

The Foreign Office agreed that there was a case to put to the Resident and the Government of India and in the circumstances I agreed that we would telegraph to the Resident and the Government of India asking v/hether they would agree to drop the two-decker scheme and have the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf transferred to the Conservancy Board itself. / 72- - * T ^ tvJudwj ^ ^ o Jo wf)'-T^i^ant U the Property of His Br itannic Majesty's Go, efnmc „ f shonld bc re tarned to the Foreign Office if not req uired for offfalai mc.

I Had three hours in private with Minister of Court and Minister for Foreign Affairs who hardly spoke* They professed the greatest desire to reach immediate settlement* Conversation was very discursive* So far as judged from first contact all should he easy provided we can settle Bahrein. On this subject Persian view is that they have a claim which can he disposed of either by reference to seme tribunal or by negotiation* They me Lite in that both preferred negotiation it is pure waste of time for me to say that Persian claim is rubbled, v^oe claim depending chiefly on value attached to i^ by claimant* I regard this as common sense* ^ I think I convinced them that we will not do them over Tamb at expense of Sheikh* Being satisfied something territorial is what they went I cuuked whether they had ever thought of suggesting emmpansation elsewhere* Minister at once mentioned Mial I said that he seemed to think that we always claims at the expense of third parties* We talked round issue end eventually Minister indicated Persian claims in Bhat-j^ cp+m sfledbe In harmony with view of His Majesty's Government. iXirins this part of conversation I tried t0 get Minister to admit that we had urged Persian government to say what they wanted in Shat-el-Arab (apart from (? impracticable) frontier rectification). At the end of interview Minister said he wanted to invite Sir H. Humphrye here in March and he was sure the Shah would like him. I welcomed this, addins that as a matter of fact I was hoping to receive a visit from him about end of February. To return specifically to Bahrein I submit for consideration two possible lines of approach, ( 1 ) a frontier rectification in Baluchistan if somethin ■n&gt; innocuous can be found ( 2 ) clause in treaty by which Persia, while reserving -no right to submit issue to arbitration, will meanwhile give Bahrein ( grp, undec.) on basis of reciprocity rights described in our draft treaty and exemption from military service.

In this case the vessels would remain under trie jurisdiction of the Board in tlie event of the words n and which form part of a recognised port' being retained in Article 2 .

Before examining the questions wruch shou- ^ be dealt with in that settlement, I thin.^ it v^ll to u,raw attention to the fact that the past attitude of Majesty’s Government towards the nuestion of the -■ ersu- Iraq frontier in the Shatt-el- r hm t)@an ^ misrepresented in the documents received from tb* ItaQ. Ministry of Foreign 'ffairs, copies of wh L we euclosei with Major Young’s despatch Secret of October, 1931. In this correspondence, for ©x,^!©, reference is made to certain discussion^ ln 19 a or in 1925, between taken place in Lena on, either in i * the comassioM II QOLONil m ^ H. HU,UIIBYS, G.C.M.G. , G.O.Y.O., K.B.H., C.I.H.,the Minister of Court and Sir ,ust@n CMasiherlaln f who is alleged to have stated that Hie Majesty*• Government saw no objection to the revision of the Shat t*el-Arab frontier if circumstances were favourable* fhls can only refer to a conversation held on the ^7th of July, 19E8, in the course of which Sir .Austen Ch mberlain, as is shown by paragraph 5 of his despatch of the £7th of July, 19B8, to Els Majesty v s Charg^ d*Affaires at f i^hran (a copy of which was enclosed with Mr. - mery 1 s Confidential despatch of the 9th of August, 1938), informed the Minister of Court that rf His Majesty’s Covern- stent were not prepared to reconsider the decisions cotue to some 15 years ago, but that, so far as practical politics were at issue, they were prepared to see whether some working arrangement, satisfactory to Loth parties, might not be reached, possibly by the inclusion on the Basra tort Trust of a i erslan representative. *' Sir Austen Chamberlain, therefore, did not state that his Sorarnment were in farour of frontier revision, but, on the oontriry, declared meet definitely that Hie Maje.ty’e Ooverament were not prepared to consider it* 3. Again, the nature of the aaeuranoee given by His Majesty's Government to the lersian lovenawnt in March, 1929, has been misrepresented. Shose assurances, as set forth in the enclosure in Blr B. Clive's despatch So. 163 of the 16th of March, 1929 (a oo.'j of w&amp;ioh wa * transmitted direct to your predecessor), m.re to the effect that His Majesty's Government, having learned in detail from the Persian Government the practical difficulties arising from the present utaw of the Shatt-el-Arab and the guarantees desired, would lend theirtheir good offices with ihe Iraqi Soveroment to aoaiet ioroia 1 b obtaining hor roasoxiable demanda* The first stopf tfhoroi or® i was for I ei ala to state the jpraotioaX dlffioultieo arising from the present state of affairs, together with the guarantees which she desired; and this the i erst&amp;n Govaraaont have not yet done. Moreover, His Majesty 1 s Government only undertook to assist 1 era la if her demands were reasonable. The i or elan Government are not justified in endeavouring to persuade the Iraqi representative at Tehran that His Majesty 1 a Government have promised la principle to give Aeraia any facilities in the Shatt~ al-Arab* 4. Hi© Majesty’s Government have in fact always realised that it is not in their power to remedy any Persian grievances arising from the Treaties in lures, and that facilities in the Shat t-el-Arab can only b® given to Persia by the Iraqi Government. They have. indeed, always been anxious to avoid any suspicion that they desired to barter away to the Perelen Government tiw rights of Iraq in order to facilitate a general Bottle- ment of their own outstanding dispute© with &gt; ersi--. This, however, was not their main reason fox not ha' g preTiously appro^obad the Iraqi Oererawat oa the questi-.a of frontier modlfIcatioa. Tbe real attitude of Hie Majesty’s Cioverno-ent towards tliis question is sb wa lord Ousbeadun's despatob of tb# ^ ri - k,t i ' ov ' , '“ u,! ' r ' to Hie Majesty's Minister at Vebrsa ^opy oi wbioh me dasomteh Secret A of the a9tn of enclosed with Mr. &amp;mery a a^isp Hoveaibar, 1928) and subsequent oorrespondenoe. aihou^ it is unusual for a frontier line to follow one bank of3&gt; # it W8»s ooitgiderQd that spscial oiroumstaiia@B muU be held to Justify this in the case ©f the ♦ rab« Persia has other porta ©a her loag ©oaet-liae; 'but Iraq has only the ^ort of Basra, seventy miles up the river, and it appeared to be only equitable that she should have absolute sovereignty over the waterway leading to that port, © spec tally in view of the fact that Persia is guaranteed by treaty full liberty of navigation to Persian ports served by the waterway, i ore over, it was feared that, if Persia’s claim to sovereignty over half the river wore once admitted, ohe might avail herself of her inoreaaec opportunities to obstruct the trade of Basra and the other Bhatt-el-Arab ports, in the hope of diverting such trade to her own new port at Khor Musa. A further cons ids rat ion was that the oonstitutional position in Iraq appeared to render it impr&amp;oiio&amp;bl* to advise the cession to isrsla of any part of Iraqi territory, at all events without adequate comjonsution; and it was not considered that &gt; ersia would be prepared to give such substantial eofflpensatioa as would be acceptable to the Iraqi Isrlisduent and Government. 5* fht above considerations which caused Bis Majesty’s Government in the past to abstain from rec osnuending any modification of the uhat t- e 1 - Arab frontier, apply with equal force to-day* These, n&amp; the further considerations to which I will now retvr, have led His Majesty’s Govornfficnt to the conclusion that Persian demand for frontier modification la that region should be firmly resisted. II can well imagine that the proposal to concede a more favourable frontier line to Persia in the bhatt-el-ii*ab might have a certain superficial attract ion for the Iracjl Government, both as a gesture of good-will and also an a means to secure countervailing concessions from Persia* But I consider that the Iraqi Government would do well to reflect whether concessions extracted from Persia in return for frontier modification might not in practice prove evanescent, whereas a frontier concession one® formally granted could never, in all probability, be withdrawn. Apart from the minor frontier adjustments suggested in paragraph IZ of Mr. idmond’s note accompanying Major Young f s semi official letter of the £9th of October, (Ho. $. v.l.39o;, I presume that the Iraqi Government would wish to secure certain more im- art ant benefits. they woulo., tor example, presumably endeavour to obtain (1) aaattraaesa that the f.raiaa pert of Khor tsi.a would not be dereloped at the expense of the ports of the Shat t-cl-Arab; and (2) a Coneeryunay Board Conrentlon guaranteeing i'eralaa oo-operation In the aalstenano. ana topraremeat of the Shaft-cl-Arab waterway. •me permanent value of the above oonoeseiona would, however, be Largely dependent on the continued «°od-wlU and good faith of the i ereian Oevernment. ua0 ' s ifc - r8ia hud secured an .advance of her frontier to the middle Hue of the 'Thalweg' or to the median line ^ Lhe shatt-el-Arab, there could be no certainty that the bersian government would continue to observe any p given in regard to the development of the ort of Khor te. a . and if that port were developed and 1 ersian tradetr«wi® deflected thither, then the reduction of shipping in the ^hatt~#i~Arab, and thus of t a* rtvenus accruing to the Conservancy Board, might in time render the continued exiateno© of that Board impracticable. By this means, Persia might be able to secure a more favourable frontier without Iraq in the final result obtaining any substantial compensatery advantage&amp;• 6. Consequently, considered from the point of view of Iraq alone, it is extremely doubtful whether a modification of th© 3hntt~el«»&amp;rab frontier could be Justified. From the point of view of His Majesty 1 # Government frontier modification in favour of Persia is no leas open to object lea* On strategic grounds. His Majesty’s Government attach the greatest importance to the unfettered use of the Bhatt*©!*Arab, which is the vital artery for th® passage of supplies ane. warlih© stores to His Majesty’s Forces in Iraq* fhey regard -1 as essential that the use of talc waterway by His Majesty’s Forces, both in psao® war, sh^uio b« lie© from restrictions, and they hold that this freedom would b© sn&amp;angsred if part of the navigable portion ol Urn waterway war® under rersian control or sovere ignty* His Majesty’s Government naturally aesume.- when the Anglo-lraqifreaty of 1930 was negotiated that the Shatt-el-Arab would remain under Iraqi sovereignty, and certain provisions of the treaty were based on that assumption. Any alteration ox th^ fx vati-r region would, therefore, render it necessary to con,,id,r afresh theses it ion of the Imperial screes t ri « freatv has entered into force stationed in Iraq after the rrtaty 7.?# AS you ar# aware It is the eoaaidersd spiulos of His Majesty ? b Gov^rament that the sstaMislimsnt of a OonserTaney Board would offer the moat satisf-aetory solution of the present frontier difficulties and provide the Beet safeguard for the future, and Els Majesty’s Government consider it essential that if such a Beard 1® set up there should b© British representation thereon# Without a measure .of British participation in the future eon&amp;erv&amp;noy arrangements of the shati-ei- rab, it would be impossible adequately to saf 0 gu?.ird British strategical and commercial interests in Iraq* 1. not# from paragraph Z of your despatch Secret 4 of the 11th ©f December, that you have reason to think that the Iraqi /'rime Minister and hi® •colleagues would not themselves be averse from British participation in any agreement which dealt with questions affecting British interests, and X trust that you will be successful in convincing them that a convent ion to set up a Conservancy Board in the Shat ■ rab definitely falls within this category* lot only could British representation on the ConeerTanoy Bo-ird be justified as aeceesery in orior to ensure that Hi* Majesty*a SoTernment will w •« ® jo.... ion to carry out their military obligation* under the ’.re .ty of Alliance# but further justification i* tu ^ faUHa ln the fact that almost all the shipping Proceed lag to Shatt-el- rab ports 1.

The foregoing arguments, together with such others as may suggest themselves to you in the light of your knowledge of local conditions, will, l hope, prove sufficient to convince the Iraqi Government that British participation in the Conservancy Board scheme is entirely justified. These arguments, are, however, for the most part unsuitable for use 'with the Persian Government, -na further arguments may he needed in order to bring that Government to accept British representation on the Conservancy Board, In tills connection His 'Majesty*© Government are impressed by the suggestion made in Major Young 1 s semi-official letter of the 29 th o^. October, 1931, that the claim of His Majesty*» Government to participate in a dhatt-el-Arab Conservancy Oonventioa would he strengthened if the proposed Conservancy Board ware to be associated more closely %hm has hitherto been contemplated with the Ugl-tin* and buoy inti of the Portion Gulf. they have therefor, considered whether the new organisation, * hlch wil1 nm&amp; to be aet up eventually In consequence of the Government'e wish to control the lighting ant buoying Persian watJre, can be adapted to this end. *** tb « dues for the lighting end buoying of the ®hola « Persian Oulf are at present collected in the ^ett-el-Arab, it should, la the oplaioa of His Majeot^e Goternmeat, he posssihle to arrange for the proposed Coaoervaacy ii'O^irtl to he itself directly respoaeihle for the lightlne tad 'buoying of the 0ulf. la that &amp;rmt $ the objection to Persian representation on a body charged with the rdmlnistration of the lights and buoys in Arab waters might be met by arranging for the administration of the lighting and buoying works in Persian waters to be entrusted to a special .ub-OorMittee containing a Persian representative, and for the administration of the works on the Arabian side of the Gulf to be entrusted to another Sub^Goamittee on which Persia would not be represented* As the lighting and buoying of the Arabian side of the Gulf is a British responsibility, it would be possible for His Majesty 1 s Government to assert a stronger right to representation on the Conservancy Board, if that body were to be responsible for the lighting and buoying of the Gulf* An at present advised, therefore, Ms Majesty 1 ® Government would be disposed to support some such arrangement as that outlined above, and, provided that you see no objection, they would be glad if yau vould discuss the proposal with the Director of the Fort oi Basra* You may also at your discretion proceed with the preparation of draft provisions to give exfeet thereto either to be incorporated in the Jonservancy Convention or, if considered preferable, to torm $ of a separate agreement* Any draft that may be prepared for this purpose should be submitted to mo by elegraph before formal communication to the Iraqi ftvsrxaiont, and copies should be sent to Ms jee y ini star in Tehran and the Resident in the Persian Gulf for their observations.9« *au i'ts'v 0 alj*®Edy £n jay UfldSf 3?©^®2*fcnccs © S'ty * s Gqy&amp; Y r&amp; n ^yjjt. xiQ objection to the wmn&amp;mmt to article 4 suggested in. your despatch Secret A of the IXth of heceiaher, no# hare they any obserrations to offer on the substance of the draft treaty of Residence and Neighbourly Relatione which accompanied that despatch. fou will also have learned from Lord Raaefield 1 * Confidential despatch of the 38th of July-that Hie Majesty*a Government do not with at the present stage to offer observations upon the draft Protocol Regulating frontier Relations, enclosed with Air Vice- arahal l-udlow-Heyltt t s despatch, Confidential f C* of the 19th June* they see no objection to the communication in due course of these two draft instrument® to the Persian Government to serve as a basis for negotiation* 10.

Our intervention, which would necessarily be against any alteration of the frontier, might nell be interpreted both by the Irakis and. by the Persians as being due primarily to reasons connected with our own imperialistic policy. We should be regarded as endeavouring to prevent a rapprochement between Iraq and Persia; and the effect would almost certainly be to bring the two parties closer together, out of common resentment against cur intervention, thus rendering more likely a settlement opposed to British interests* He remarked that paragraph Z of Mr. Floods letter of December 14th to Sir F* Humphrys implied bh&amp;t ever ? possible argument should be used to dissuade- the Iraqi Government from agreeing to frontier aX^AC^onc Foreign Office however, as explained in paragraph letter of December 3rd to the Colonial Qi^^ce, inc - ' the view that it was undesirable either uG e/ e0Ura - ^ * n* to try to dissuade them Iraqis to change the frontier or from doing S 0 o MR.

His point was, however, that Hie Majesty’s Government should not tahe the initiative in offering advice t 0 the Iraqi Government against complying with the Persian desiderata, knj over-anxiety on our part to prevent the ir Government from meeting the Persian Government's suggestions might possibly bring about the very situation which n- desired to avoid* MIh HALL thought that it would be dangerous for Hi&lt;~ Government to withhold their advice^ present Ira Government could, he thought, be relied upon not to disregard my advise on such an important question which Sir F, Humphry might give them.

Group Captain Peirse was impressed with Mr. Hall’s arguments and considered that no risk should be taken by failing to make the position clear to the Iraqi Government. MR. KEMEI suggested as an alternative course that the various objections to an alteration of the frontier in the Shatt-el- krab both from the Iraqi and from the British oom 0J ¥iew should he fully communicated to Sir r.

It was important, too, not to give tc.e Iraqi Government reason to believe that His Majesty's Government contemplated drastic intervention to prevent vneir 3 with the Persians* It was agreed that the Colonial Office should prepare, 10r Foreign Office concurrence, a draft reply vo J -• Humphrys telegram* ja- no^T'hA baarins ox ohe Anglo' The meeting proceeded uo discus^ ^j-- Iraqi Treaty of 1950 upon the question* MR. HENBBh said that the legal aspect or v*-.-' 1 ' 1 had been raised by the Admiralty and Air Minist-ry had . n-p-f-5 re „ WO should examined by the legal advisers ox ins ^ orex ,, Qfrp. rnreatv should have probably be entitled to say, once the Ivo. * come0 int0 force, ‘that negotiations between Iraq and Persia h re g a rd to the alteration of the Shatt-el-wab frontier, or ai-th regard to navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab, were matters of foreign policy which effected the common interests of the two High Contracting Parties to the Treaty of 1980; and we could therefore maintain that Iraq would be bound under Article 1 o? that Treaty to engage in 'franh consultation' with His Majesty's Government as regards these negotiations. But t/he Treaty will not bind Iraq, even in respect of matters where consultation is required, to be definitely guided by the views of His Majesty's Government, or not to take any action of which His Majesty's Government disapprove. The 1950 Treaty, which will only come into force after Iraq's entry into the hsague of Nations, would not, therefore, give us a strong legal claim to prevent the alteration of - c+o in the proposed Conservancy Boardo frontier s or to participate in tue propo . _ the treaty argniaent was open He considered, in any case, tna - to objection.

He was aware that such a step might be considered as an unfriendly act by Persia, but he thought that in the present state of Anglo-ptsrsian relations such an eventuality might be viewed with equanimity* MR^ R BNIEli said that, apart from the possible effect on Anglo- Persian relations, he thought that the use of such an argument would he most undesirable. It would be an error, at all events in the first instance, to lay undue stress upon the wishes of His Majesty's Government, After further discussion it was agreed that sir F« Humphrys must be given all the arguments against frontier modit ication, together with full discretion with regard to the use to be made of them. It should be suggested to him that it would he well not to refer in the first instance to the strategic needs of His Majesty's Government in view of the fact uhat this was likely to raise the suspicions of the Iraqis with regard to the motives underlying his advice, fhe Colonial Office would orepare a draft despatch to Bagdad after tne receipt of Sir F, Humphrys 1 despatch now on way. Colonial Office would, moreover, prepare a draft telwgxam in reply 'to Sir F, Humphry s' telegram of December 12th, and would be careful not to commit His Majesty s Government to r ®p!y on every aspeot of Perso-lraqi relations.2* British Participation in the propoaed ._ConservsnQy Board. MR.RENBSL explained the Foreign Office view that, whether the frontier were altered, or not, it would he necessary t© proceed with the proposal for setting up a Conservancy Board, If the frontier were changed Iraq would need the Board to protect her own interests; if the frontier remained unchanged the Board would he the only means of placating Persia and off the only hope of discouraging her from developing Khcr Musa, or rather from attempting to divert to that port the whole of the shipping now proceeding to Persian ports on the Shatt-el Arab. MR.HANCOCK undertook, at Mr, Hall's request, to make enquiries as to the possible practical difficulties in the w of developing Khor Musa, MR.RSNDEL proceeded to say that it remained to he decided how 'best to broach the question of the Conservancy Board with the Iraqi Government so as to ensure British participation. The Foreign Office considered that the case for British participation was exceedingly strong, arr that- the, Iraqi Government should he told that, as the snipping v&gt;hi the Board would control was almost exclusively Britimi. r ‘-- Majesty's Government must obviously he represscn Board. MR.MARKER agreed as to the strength of His McjCoty s G ' uVoiR ment's claim to participation ©n the grounc of the predommenue of British shipping and thought that this claim was strengthened by reason of the international character of the river, MR,HANCOCK expressed seme doubt as to whether predominance of shipping alone gave any legal claim to representation. MR,RENDEL thought that the claim of Hi- MajestyGovernment cn grounds of equity and common sense to representation on the Board would justify them in strongly pressing their demand, and suggested that the Iraqi Government might even he told, if necessary, that they would he behaving in an unfriendly manner if they opposed British participation. M R,HALL eaid that, while he had no reason to anticipate opposition from the Iraqi Government if the matter were put to them in this light, he would like at the same time tc be able to advance a legal argument for British representation on the Board, which Iraq might employ vie~a~vig of the Persians, MR. RAN DSL interposed by remarking that this led to the third item on the agenda, namely:3* The possible assumption by the Car\9f&gt;-p\r&gt;^^ y Board of control «■-' • *trrrnumnmiimmam i n ., nver the Lighting a nd Buoyin g oj „th,e_P_e rsian Gulf . MH»KSNIi&amp;I j ssio t’.hst» in ths opinion of the Foreign Office? this proposal would, if adopted, provide a legal argument to strengthen the case for Hie Majesty’s Government’s participation in the Conservancy Board scheme. MR.MAff CgR Eaid that the Board of Trade considered that it would he a mistake to alter the present arrangements for lighting and huoying the Persian Gulf, which were working satisfactorily. MH. BAXTER explained that the Persian Government had, some time ago, expressed the wish to take over the lights and buoys in Persian waters. A Conference had been provisionally arranged last year to discuss the question, but had been postponed, as the Persians had failed to put forward any proposals as a basis of discussion. li? was, however, certain that the present arrangements by which we arranged for the maintenance of lights and buoys in Persian, as well as Arab waters, could not be maintained much longer. The question would probably arise in an acute form on the forthcoming arrival in the Gulf of the new Persian patrol vessels purchased in Italy* In these circumstances the Foreign Office lett?*. -* 3rd to the Colonial Office had suggested a solution bas?a on a proposal put forward by the Political Resident in ^ une * 193 It was suggested that the proposed Shatt.-el-A^ ab co^^^rvancy Board should be responsible for lighting and buoying nc t only in the river, but also throughout the Persian Gulf, and a special sub-committee with a Persian representative should be in charge of the works in Persian waters, ox\d a ^ committee, on which Persia would not be represented, should be inin charge of the works on the Arabian side of the Gulf. mr» ANDERSQN said that the India Office concurred in this proposal which met their view that a Persian should not be directly concerned in the administration of lighting and buoying on the Arab coast. The possible constitution of the two sub-committees was then considered. It was thought that the sub-committee for the Persian side of the Gulf should have the Persian representative oxi the Conservancy Board as its chairmanj and that for the Ara^ side of the Gulf should have the British representative on the Conservancy Board as its Chairman. The Iraqi member on the conservancy Board might perhaps he a member of both eub-ccmmitteee, or of neither. The remaining members of the sub-committees would probably be drawn from the personnel employed by the Conservancy Board. MR.MARKER explained that the Board of Trade had no wish to disturb the present satisfactory arrangement as regards the lighting and buoying in the (half, and that it wao with this consideration in mind that the Board of Trade had written their letter of the 11th December to the col on- *1 Office. view, however, of the difficulty of maintaining the present system, as explained by Mr. Baxter, he thought that the Board of Trade would no longer maintain their ohdoction t , that the conservancy Board should assume control over the lighting and buoying of the Oulf, and it seemed to him that the scheme would help to secure British representation on the Conservancy Board, which the Board of Trade considered wee of the grea.e.t^ ♦ re-submit the whole question importance. He wished, however, to the competent authorities at the Board of trade. - a wjbg ftf/reedt thst subje-t MR.RENDEL suggested, and ® g tcto, the views of the Board of Trade the proposal for linking the ccnservansy Beard with the lighting and the huoying cf the Gulf p &gt; should he included in the instructions which it was proposed to send to Sir F.

REND5L here referred to the Acting High Conmiiesioner*s secret despatch to the Colonial Office of the 12th November, rw thought that Major Young was wrong in supposing that the nature of the advice to be given to the Iraqi Government on this question must depend largely on the decision taken with regard to the visits of Persian warships to Arab ports in the Persian Gulf® There was all the difference between the visits of a Persian warship to the ports of Iraq* with whom Persia had established friendly relatione? and to the ports of the Arab rulers with whom Persia had refused to establish any relations at alio The advice to be given to the Iraqi Qovemment must, in the opinion oi the Foreign Office, aepena solely on the practice obtaining ordinarily between friendly governments. This he understood to be that permission is unnecessary, but that notification of the visit should be given some time before it is to take place, if possible in sufficient time for objection to be raised if, for any reason the proposed visit happened to be inopporfcu.n&lt;.° CAPTAIN mmm agreed that this represented the ordinary international practice® The meeting concurred in the views expressed by Mr. Mendel (b) Operations of Persian warships in the Shaft- el-Aiab.

INDIA OFFICE^ ^ Dear Dalton, I enclose a copy of tiie promised despatch from Sir Francis Humphrys regarding the proposed settlement of outstanding questions between Iraq and Persia. I should be glad if you would regard this despatch as having been communicated to the India Office officially. I also enclose a copy of a semi-official letter from Sir Francis Humphrys bearing on the'same subject. In certain respects the despatch rather alters the position, which was discussed at the Interdepartmental Conference at the foreign On ice on the 16th of December, and it now seems necessary to let the High Commissioner have a telegraphic reply ^at^nll events on certain of the points raised in his tclogrs*. This 0. WALTON, ESQ. , C.B,This can be followed up by a despatch dealing more fully with the issues involved. I enclose a draft telegram and a draft despatch for your concurrence. The first part of the despatch is, as you will see, based very closely upon Foreign Office letter Cho. E 5639/5280/34) of the 3rd of December, and the last part, I think, reproduces mutatis mutandis the general conclusions of the Interdepartmental Conference. We should like to get the telegram off at once, and I hope that you will be able to let me know by telephone in the course of to-day or tomorrow that it has the concurrence of the India Office. If any Department has substantial alterations to suggest in the draft despatch, it would probably save time to have another Interdepartmental meeting; but unless the draft despatch issues by the mail of 7th January, it will arrive in Baghdad after Sir Francis Humphrys has left for Geneva, and will not, therefore, be of much, if any, use. Perhaps you would very kindly let me know as soon as possible (a) whether you concur in the draft telegramtelegram or have any alterations to suggest, and (b) whether you think that the draft despatch should be discussed in conference. I am writing in similar terms to Baxter, Trickett, Hancock, Peirse and G-rimshaw. Yours sincerely.IV/.

It appears to me ti^t Article 4 . as at present#C£!v present drafted, cal feint be regarded by both the f'ereiaas arid the Iraqis as arrogating to ids Majesty's tovertment Ui unduly favourable potltiou lu relatioa to the aoard, and 1 sugbeet that it might be preferable to substitute the words •uovernmeata of the rdgh Contractiag parties* for the *.orde 'authorl ti«e of tx.e riparian ntates*. It Bight of course be argued tnat it goes without saying tliat the Board is not to be controlled by ids Majesty's government but la view of the fact that It Is precusaobly the intention of ids rajeety'e tovernroent tiiet the chairasnridp snould be held by a British naval officer, I think the Convention would be easier to ucgotiat* if the wording 1 now suggest were to be adopted, b. For a similar reason, 1 would suggest timt tne wording of Article 24 should fee re- considered, .v,; at present drafted, it provides for tne denunciation of tut Convention solely on tn# ground of a aifsinufdon in volutse of snipping proceeding to i®rs ai* P ; rws in t.»* uhatt al Arab, and it appears to me possible that the Persian negotiators may object to no similar provision being made for denunciation in consequence of British interests in tne u;*tt al Arab dlainisiiins. 1 suggeso, therefore , that 1 stxould be authorised at !! b dlBcrt uion to agree to provision being made in tide articl-. for tne King of Iraq to have power to denounce the Couveation in the event of the Iraqi government and Hie Majesty's Uoverxraent ceasing to be allies.

My dear i ariciusou, 1 aaould like u&gt; amplify aiy dcapaweB of today oa %tus qucetlou of iraqi-reral&amp;a relations, la widen 1 nave purposely m de no referene* to tne vetM , e of tne proposed tripartite negotiations between ourselves and tne iersian Rad Iraqi t,overnf«ents. no far as 1 Know, ids Eaje6ty , s Uoverment neve not yet decided where the Conservancy Board Convention is to be negotiated with the j ersians. 1 By self suggested last year that as soon as agreement had been reached with the Iraqis 1 anould go to leheran with hurl and co-operate with Clive in trying to get toe Persian* to accept our draft. I ;nve also mentioned this proposal to tioare, as 1 told the conference at toe Foreign Office on toe 3bto September, but 1 i*ave heard nothing furtoer on toe subject. Meanwhile toe position has been corapll cated by two unforeseen events. Klxjg Faissd has been invited by tne hiiah to pay a State visit to leheran in April .and tne Iraqis have got busy witn drefte of tne two instruments referred to in my despatch. In addition to this, bo to Haurtacne and Feroghl ii&amp;ve been talking to leuflq nuweidi, tne frail ) ini Rter at leneran, about the Snatt al Arab, and we snail tove to move qul culy if we are not to be squeezed out.* on to inking It over, 1 am inclined to tne view tnat it would be more conve.-dent if 1 were to negotiate toe Conservancy Board Convention myself with2 *itn txie i-erglfeiiB here in Bagfedaa issnediiii-eiy after &lt;«ve got it through the Iraqi Government ( if i do get it tirough). Ihle would have the edvantage that &amp;11 the experts on toe British and Iraqi, side will be easily available, and toe hnstt itself is wiwdu easy reach o f the Persian negotiator would lixe to get first hand information. Another point is tt*t if toe negotiation© &amp;r® conducted in leheraa, hoare will certainly went some-one from here to i*elp ala with details, and if 1 went up myself 1 might be Kept ij»ijgiag about lade finitely end eventually find no self obliged to come away, froa the Iraqi side, I&amp;ufiq nuweldl 1© nardly a match for ilaurtache on a subject of which he Kiiowa lees than nothing, and this means that hurl himself would probably have to go, which would be inconvenient while pari lament ie in see© ion. I still think it might help if 1 went up on a private visit before toe negotiations began, primarily of course to discuee the w;nl«- thing with noare and get ids advice on the Persian point of view, but also with toe object of making the peruo.ial acquaiataece of toe SBah and iisurtaci«e. 1 .npe mar© will be able to persuade toemto notlaate a real plenipotentiary to conduct toe negotiations in taghdad. me Kind of rough prograuiB© 1 would euggeet is that 1 should tackle i.ari at Getieva in Jfeiaiary and try to get idm to swallow our draft before we come bacx here. 2 could then, if convenient to tuoare go up to leheran for ® couple of days vine he was putting it through the Council of Ministers, hud. return to Baghdad armed with isoare’s advice on toe beet wa v of getting it through toe Persiaue. I do not went to raise toe question officially for obvious reasons , but 1 do feel strongly wnatI will address you more illy by despatch on the subject of i Shait*el*&amp;r&amp;b frontier and nnscted questions.CO- ersian frontier negotiations for example ted boon dragging on for years and now seamed further from settlement than ever# •• e knew moreover that there were serious difficulties in the way of Iraq, giving Persia any frontier rectification in the katt el Arab. It seemed to him questionable therefore whether it was necessary or desirable that Hie Majesty* a Government should intervene ith the Irsqi Government in this matter, at any rate at the present stage. Our intervention, which would necessarily he against any rectification of the frontier, might ell be interpreted both by the Iraqi® and by the Persians as being due primarily to reasons connected with our own imperialistic policy. e should be regarded as endeavouring to prevent a rapprochement between Iraq and ereia; end the effect would almost certainly be to bring the two parties closer together, out of common resentment against our intervention, t .us rendering more likely a settlement opposed to British interests. He emarked that paragraph 2 of Mr. Flood*8 letter of December X vth to dir F. Humphry* implied, that every possible argument should be used to dissuade the Iraqi Gbvornment from agreeing to frontier rectification. 'u:e Foreign Office however*, as explained in paragraph b of their letter of December 3rd to the Colonial Office, inclined to the view that it was undesirable either to encourage the Iraqis to change the frontier or to try to dissuade them from doing so. If-. FLOtPw stated that from the recent communications received from ir F. Humphry a, it looked as though the Iraqi Government were anxious to receive the advice ol His Majesty’s Government on this question. Tlw Colonial Office considered, that if Iraq were to agree to ary formof frontier rectification, Pore la would then be in a position to pUce the greatest difficulties in the way of shipping in ths thatt—el^-Arab f and that this consideration, alone gave His gsjrtBty’s aoverrusont sufficient justification for advising Iraq, in her own interests, sgaiast agreeing to the oral an p@quest* m:. i agreed that, if the Iraqi Government asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Oovernmont, it would be possible to point out to them the possible dangers to Iraq of frontier rectification. His .point was, however, t- at His Majesty’s Government should not take the Initiative in offering advice to the Iraqi government against complying * ith the ei si an desiderata * ny over-anxiety on our part to prevent the Iraqi Government from meeting the ersian Government's suggestions at ht possibly bring about the very situation which it web desired to avoid. Eh:.X thought that it would be dangerous for His Majesty’s Government to withhold their advice* The present Iraqi Government could, he thought, be relied upon not to disregard any advice on such an important question which Sir F#Humphry* might give them. n the other hand. If Hi® Majesty’s Government were to disinterest themselves completely in the question, there was a greater risk that Iraq, might give way to the crslan wishes. MI, ■ MliRgoy said that the India Office were not directly concerned in the frontier as. ©ct of the- question, and did not wish to express an opinion on this point* H G; agreed with Mr* Hall in thinking that it would be dangerous for His Majesty’s Government to disinterest them- selves in the question and leave it entirely for discussion between Iraq, and ersia. GEOOPfl p nf P C T IH that in the view of the Air Ministry tii© security of the British forces in Iraq de, ended on tj,a Bslntenence of the present hatt-el- ' rafo frontier* He wes * Uapmsed by Mr* Hell** view, and thought that no risk should be twenty felling to make the position clear to t .

RKUEh suggested as an alternative course that the various otActions to a rectification of the frontier in tl;-e nett ©1 Arab both from the Iraqi and from the British point of view should be fully communicated to Sir F. Hu&amp;phrys» but that he should be given a vide measure of discretion how far to press these views on the Iraqi Government, and should be warned of the possible hangers of giving advice which might produce an unfavourable re action* MI. FLOCr. agreed that it would be undesirable to limit in any way the measure of discretion to be left to Sir P. Humphry8* He suggested, however, that it would fee impossible for the present meeting to reach a final decision upon the instructions to be sent to Mr F* Humphry's, whose telegram of December 18th, received since the meeting had feeem arranged t showed that a comprehensive despatch was on its way to the colonial oft ice • Hr F.Humphry's had requested in that telegram authority to inform the Iraqi Government that His Majesty*&amp; Government would shortly be coiaiuunieating to him their views on the whole question of • ergo— raqi relations, and that they would deprecate any steps D eing taken fey the Iraqi Government pending the receipt ox their v h, : s* lUi© Colonial office were anxious to send an imme&amp;ist* ^ply on this point* kUUL^ said that any . e ly to this telegram, should, he thought ta ** Into account the fact t. «t it ’- as Imposelfelo to guarantee to * lv « the Iraqi Government a full exposition of the views of Hi* ^jssty’a Government on every aspect of ferso--raqi relations*It important* too, not to give tfce Iraqi (&gt;ovei*nment reason to btfli^ve tiiat His Majoety 1 ® 0overiment contemplated drastic intei^ntion to prevent their negotiations with the : eiaian®. it %as agreed that the Colonial Office should prepare, for Foreign office concurrence, a draft re,Ay to ir F.Humphry® 1 telegram. The meeting proceeded to discus® the bearing of the /nglo~ Iraqi Treaty of 1950 upon the question. i&amp;h KRIiOKh said that the legal aspect of this question which had been raised by the Admiralty and ir i;ini®try had been examined by the legal adviser© of the Foreign. Office. Ve should probably be entitled to say, once the iff® Treaty should have coae into force, that negotiation® between Iraq end ersia with regard to the alteration of the hhatt-el- rab frontier, or with regard to navigation on the shatt~©X-Ar«b» were matters of foreign policy which affected, the common interests of the two High Contracting arties to the Treaty of 1 50; ami we could therefore maintain that Iraq, would be bound under Article 1 of that Treaty to engage in 'fremit consultation' Vi-ith His Majesty f &amp; 0overnmen.t as regards these nogotiationa# it Uie Treaty will not bind Iraq, even In respect of matters where consultation is required, to be definitely guided by the views of His Majesty*s Government, or not to ta&amp;e any action of which His Majesty 1 s Government disapprove. The 1950 Treaty, which will only some into force after Inq'B entry into the League of nations» would not, therefore, give us a strong legal claim to prevent the alteration of the frontier, or to participate in the proposed conservancy Board. He considered, in any case, that the treaty argument was open t° objection. it had been proposed to try to show the , rnoi Government that it was in their own interests not to alter the ■‘•foBtiei', it would seem to be a tactical error to lay stro.^ upon/ I ) upon the interests or strategic needs of Rls ! 5 -jest.y's aoverment. An appeal to the 1920 Treaty was likely to sake the Iraqi government suspicious of the motives with which our ad vie© was offered* MF« K-x.- :f Bug'geatea that the m&amp;inten&amp;nce of the strategic facilities needed by the British military authorities vc-ere fc 8 much un Iraqi interest as a British interest* sir F* Humphrys w.b in the best position to judge how much stress to lay on ssch argument. It would be well to explain to him the various arguments as they appeared to Hie Majesty*a Government, and to leave Mm full discretion regarding their use. suggested that an altogether stronger line might be taken, and that a hint might be given to the Iraqi Government that Hie Majesty r s Government would never consent to the proposed frontier rectification. He was &amp; are that such s step might be considered as an unfriendly act by erala, but he thought that in the present state of nglo~ ersian relations such an eventuality might bo viewed with equanimity* • .h said t at, apart from the possible effect on ^nglo- ersian relations, he thought that the use of such an argument would be most undesirable. It would be an error, at all events in the first instance, to lay undue stress upon the wishes of His Majesty** Government. fteu further discussion it w-as agreed that Sir F* Humphry s amyl be given all the arguments against frontier Rectification, together with full discretion with regard to the mQ i-o be made of them. It should be suggested to Mm that ifc would be i ell not to refer in the first instance to the strategic needs of His Majesty * s Government in view of the that this was likely to raise the suspicions of the Iraqis withU with is.motives underlying &gt;^his ficlTice# The Colonial Office would prepare a draft despatch to Bagdad after the receipt of Sir P* Humphry s’ despatch now on its way. The Colonial Office would, moreover, prepare a draft telegram, in reply to Sir F. Humphry® 1 telegram of December 12th, and would be careful not to coiaiait Hi© Majesty 1 ® Government to a reply on every aspect of e r$ ol raqi re lotions.3# By|l.tl P^QljO^^i Cpatu'. pvancy explained the foreign Offiee view that, whether the frontier were altered or not, it would be necessary to proceed with the proposal for setting up r Conservancy Board. If the frontier w#r* ch nged Iraq would need the Board to protect her own in ter stss if the fi*ontier remained unchanged, the Board would be the only means of pi eating Perei ml offer the only hope of discouraging her from developing Khor ausa, or rather from attempting to divert to that port the whole of the shipping now proceeding to Persian ports on the Shatt~el- Arab. MK.H HCL'CY undertook, at Mr. Kali’s request, to make enquiries as to the possible practical difficulties in the way of &amp;&lt; ve.loping Khor Musa. MILEKUlBh proceeded to say that it remained to be decided how best to bro ch the question of the Conservancy Board with the Iraqi Government so as to ensure British participation, the Foreign Office considered that the ease for British participation was exceedingly strong, and that the Iraqi Government should be told th t, a* the shipping which the Board would control was almost exclusively r tlsh, Hie sty’s Government must o vtously be represented on the Board, agreet s© to the strength of His Majesty’s Govern- seat’s claim to p rtietpation on the ground ol the predominance ®f British shipping end thought that this claim was strengthened ky reason of the international character of the river* Mil* B di. thought that the claim of His Majesty a Government on grounds of equity • net common sense to ^pre sen tat Ion on the Board would, justify them in strongly pressing their demand, and suggested that the Iraqi Government /mightmm might even be told* if necessary, that they would be behaving- in an unfriendly meaner if they opposed British participation. Mb;.H Big said that f while he had no reason to anticipate opposition from the Ira i Government if the matter were put to them in this light, he would like at the ©erne time to be able to advance a legal arugment for British representation on the hoard, which Iraq might employ vis-a-vis of the Persians.

MR,R;. ; ;IOT«L said that in the opinion of the Foreign Office, this proposal would, If adopted, provide a legal argument to strengthen the case for Hi© Majesty* © Oovernmeat 1 © perticips tion in the Conservancy Board scheme. MK t RABKEB said that the Board of Trade considered that it would toe a mistake to Iter the present arrangements for lighting and ouoying the Persian Gulf, which vere working sati sfactorily. MR.B explained that the Persian Govermaent h d, some time ago, expressed the wi h to take ever the lights and buoys in Persi; n waters* A Conference had feeen provl aionally arranged last year to discuss the question, but had been postponed, *■ a the Persians h d failed to put forward any proposals as a basis of discussion* It was, however, certain that the present arrangement© by which we arranged for the maintenance of lights end buoys In Persian, a© well a© Arab waters, could not be maintained much longer* The question would probably ''rise in an ©cute form on the forthcoming arrival in the Gulf of the new Persian P trol vessels purchased in Italy* In these circumstances the Foreign Office letter oi December tocl to the Colonial Office h d suggested a solution baaed on a. Proposal put forward by the Political Resident in June, 1950. It was suggested that the proposed Shatt*’’e 1—Ar&amp;to Conservancy Board should be responsible for lighting ©ad buoying not only in the river, but also throughout the Persian Gulf, md th t a 8 P©cial sub-committae with a Persian ropreaentative ©houl'-i toe in charge of the work© in Persian waters, and a separate sub- coamittee, on which Persia would not be represented, should toe 111 charge of the works on the Arabian side of the Gulf* /Om'W (&amp; mu «aid that the India Office concurred in this proposal which met their view that a Persian should not be directly concerned In the administration of lighting and buoying o the Arab coast. The possible constitution of the two sub-commit tees was than considered. It was thought that the sub-comm, it tee for the Persian side of the Gulf should have the Per slum representative on the Conservancy Board as its Chairman; and that for the Arab side of the Gulf should have the British representative on the Conservancy Board bb its Chairman. The Iraqi member on the Conservancy Board might perhaps be a member of both sub-corn ittees or of neither. The remaining members of the sub-committees would probably be drawn from the personnel employed by the Conservancy Board. MEJAAMKR explained that the Board of Trade had no wish to disturb the present satisfactory arrangement as regards the lighting and buoying In the Gulf, ? nd that it was with this consideration In mind that the Board of Trade had written thtdr letter of the 11th December to the Colonial Office. In view, however, of the difficulty of maintaining the present system, bb explained by Ur. Baxter, he thought that the Board of Trade would no longer m intain their objection to the proposal that the Conservancy Board should assume control over the lighting buoying of the Gulf, and it seemed to him that the scheme w oul&amp; help to secure British representation on the Conservancy Board, which the .Board of Trade considered was of the greatest importance. He wished, however, to re-submit the whole question the competent authorities at the Board ox Trade. RBHD f &amp;ugg* steel, and it was agreed, that subject4. waratii^s in tU© . (aj Visits of 'Persian warships to Iraq^i ports, jgi here referred to the Acting High Oammis®ioner , s secret despatch to the Colonial Office of the 12th Hovemher. He thought that Major Young was wrong in supposing that the nature of the advice to he given to the Iraqi Government on this question must depend largely on the decision taken with re ttr ^ to the visits of Persian warships to Arab ports in the Persian Gulf. There was ail the difference between the visits of a Persian warship to the ports of Iraq.* with who® gersia had established friendly relations, and to the ports of the * rah rulers with whom Persia had refused to est&amp;blisn any relations at all* The advice to be given to the Iraqi Government must, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, depend solely on the practice obtaining ordinarily between friendly governments. This he understood to be that permission is unnecessary, but that notification of the visit should be given some time before it Is to take place, if possible in sufficient time for objection to be raised if, tor any reason the proposed visit happened to be inopportune. H^..MAN agreed that thle represented the ordinary international practice. The meeting concurred in them views expressed by V. Kendal.

Confidantial G, of the 14th February 1929, tad the only action therefore required on this point seemed to U* to reply tin t the position was unchanged* The meeting concurred in this view* MR, EAlih raised the question whether Eis Majesty*© Qomrtmmt would have any objection were Ira *. to suggest giving Persian warships freedom of operations in the Shatt~el~ Arab* was agreed that this question was too hypothetical to be examined by the present meeting, but that prim a facie there would probably be no objection to a reasonable arrangement between I ray. and Persia, provided that His Majesty*© Government were consulted previously* 11 wae. agreed that dir P. Humphry© should be asked if Iraqi showed any disposition to grant any facilities to Persian warships to which the latter were not at 'present entitled, to report the position, and, if neeeaaary, request instructions* In conclusion, it was agreed that on the receipt of the record of the present meeting end of the awaited despatch from Begctad, the Colonial Office should prepare a draft despatch to sir F.

Si: 12th Dec em her, 1931. $ fl' I am directed by Secretary Sir Philip Cunliffe- Lister to refer to the letter from this Department of the 17th of August, numbered as above, enclosing a copy of a despatch to the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq requesting his observations on the minutes of the Interdepartmental Conference bald at the India Office on the 20th of July on the subject of the formation of a Persian fleet, and to transmit to you to be laid before Secretary Sir John Simon a copy of a despatch which has now been received from Major Young in which he raises the whole question of the rights of Persian warships (1) to visit Basra without prior permission of the Iraq Government, and (2) to operate in the Shott-el-Arab. 2v Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister shares the view expressed by the Acting High Commissioner in para. 4 of hi despatch that in any negotiations on the subject of the Shatt-el-Arab, and he therefore suggests that the questions raised in the accompanying despatch should be considered at the Inter-departmental Conference which is to be hela on Wednesday, the 16th December for the purpose of discussing the Persian claims in respect of the Shatt-el-iirao, tne proposed Conservancy Board, and lighting &amp;md buoying in the Persian Gulf. 3. As regards para. 2 of the despaten, I am to invite attention to the letter from the Foreign Oliiee to the Itw iOffice of the 17th of November regarding the visits of Persian warships to ports on the Arabian side of the Persian Oulf, a copy of which was sent to the Colonial Office under cover of your letter No. E.5278/2821/34 of the 18th of November The Secretary of State trusts that before a decision is reached on this question clue consideration will be given to the aspect of the matter discussed by liajor Young in para. 2 of his despatch. 4.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to Lord Passfield’s Secret despatch dated 17th of August 1931, regarding the questions raised by the formation of a Persian Fleet, and to transmit the enclosed copy of a memorandum from Air Headquarters containing the observations of the Air Officer Comianding on the subject. 2. The question whether Persian war snips should be required to obtain the permission of the ’Iraqi Government before entering the Port of Basrah, is, of course, one for the ’Iraqi Government to decide. I anticipate that the ’Iraqi Government will desire to be guinea in making their decision by international usage and will no clouot refer to this High Commission for information an cl advice on -mis point. It would appear that, unless His Majesty’s Government are to lay themselves open to a charge of inconsistency, the nature oi the advice to be given must depend largely on the decision adov in regard to the necessity for permission being obtainco for Per si an warships to visit ports on the arab li utoi I-- therefore be advisable to bear this in mind ^hen conoidenn 0 the latter question, if it is considered undesiraoie on mili y gr ound s that Persian wars hi p s s hou 1 d visit Basrah \ i An out permission. 3. As regards the use of the waters of the Shatb-el-arao by Persian warships, I understand from the corresponds ending with Mr. Amery’s despatch Comideriuial C* dated February, 1929, that the right to navigate the Shatt accorded to Persia by Article 2 of the Treaty of Hrzeroum does not include the right to use ’Iraqi national waters for military operations, and t. Hon. Sir Philip Cimili ff e-Lis ter, Secretary of State for the Colcnics, ., MP., Downing Street, S . . 1 •d that in the case of warships the right of navigation extends . gQ j' ar as is necessary for transit purposes within limits alcgoug to those defined in the extract from Innex to Article 2 of the Straits Convention 1923, enclosed with Mr. Amery's despatch already quoted, and that furthemore the ’Iraqi Government would be within their strict legal rights in refusing to agree that Persian warships should anchor in tiie Shattwithout their perBii ssion • 4 . It seems probable in the light of the recent conversa- tions at Teheran on the subject of the Shat':-ei-Arab frontier (vide my despatch Secret B. dated the 22nd of October, 1931), that the Persian Government will attempt to secure lull rights for their warships to operate in the Shatt-al-Arab os u id T ' as as much Persian as ’Iraqi water, and it is therefore important that I should be able to advise the ’Iraqi Government as to the legal position before they engage in any negotiations with the Persian Government on this suoject. 5. In this connection it is pertinent to draw atter.ti x. to the existing arrangements whereby Persian customs craft are nnnvati 'ns in the Shatt-ai-Ai ao . permitted to carry on preventive operauens It will be remembered that early in 1924, Persian merchant vessels acting on the instructions of the Persian authorities attempted to evade the ’Iraqi Customs ccnbroi at Fao, aou a Persian Customs post was established on the Persian shore oi tne river at Gusbah. Subsequently, as a result ox canversamions between Mr. Monk and II.

This agreement, which was approved by a resolution of the 'Iraqi Council of Ministers on 3th July, 1924, was never formally aporoved by the Persian Government. It was thought that they were unable to subscribe to the admission, with which the second paragraph of Mr. Monk's letter opened, that 'any Customs con-rol involving the employment of direct tore!ole measures over craft using the main stream between Fao and iiihammerah is the sole right of the 'Iraqi Customs authorities'*. But even when it was represented that they were only required to endorse the 8 articles of the agreement given in the letter, they still took no action, their attitude being then attributed to a desire to avoid doing anything that might imply their recqgnitio of the 'Iraqi Government. The agreement has however been oper ative in practice since Mr. Monk's letter was written and I have delayed replying to your despatch until I had ascertained how it is working at the present time and whether its continuance is to the advantage of the 'Iraqi Government.

With regard to your request, G-.Q. 539 dated 1st September, for comment in so far as the matter may affect ’Iraqi interests, the main points requiring attention appears to be the entry of Persian vessels into the port of BASRAH and ’Iraqi territorial waters. It is presumed that entry will only be permitted by the ’Iraqi Government after permission has been duly asked for and granted and that Persian gunboats a ill not be allowed to enter BASRAH merely on notification. 3. As it is reported that the Persian gunboats are + o be used on easterns duties it is likely that tne Persians rm-.y wish to use them in the SHATT-AL-ARAB. It may, therefore, be necessary to reopen the question ox whether they ohould be allowed to operate in these waters witnout the permisoion of the ’Iraqi Government. Whether they show id ae ,mlo. e- co without obtaining prior permission from the Iraqi Government i a matter for consideration since the quesuioi. of -foe the SHATT-AL-ARAB is still under discussion.

Department. 2Uh at the Foreign Office on the 16th December,, consider the question of the Shatt-el-Arab (Iraqi-Perso Frontier, and. Board). Little real progress was made, owing to the fact that definite decisions an all outstanding points must await the receipt of the despatch referred to in Sir Francis Humphry’s telegram dated 12/12/31 (P.Z. 7674/31). Considerable discussion took place on the question whether H.li. Government ought to attempt to exercise any influence over the Iraq Government in regard to the question of the ratification of the frontier. The'Foreign Of fice view was that interference was undesirable - that ii the Iraqis saw that we felt strongly On the matter they might fco be driven into the arms of the Persians. The Colonial Office took the opposite view - pointing out that in the person of Sir Francis Humpbrys we have a representative who carries the greatest possible weight with the Ira^ovemment, and whose advice has seldom, if ever, been ignored,by them. The general feeling of the meeting was that while the H.C. should | not be definitely instructed to convey formally to the Iraqpovernment the views of H.M.G, we should ce put in possession of all the arguments against meeting the Persians in the matter of rectification (sec in this connection the Foreigi Office letter of the 12th December P.Z.7492/31) and that it should be left to his discretion how he should use them. ^t all events we should in the first instance lay stress on the fact that is against the interests of Iraq, and 1 should only in the last resort bring our own interests into 3000 8/31—-J'i— ... into discussion (as regards the latter, the A.M. pointed out that the security of the Shatt is essential to the retention by us of armed forces in Iraq). On the question of the Conservancy Board, ihe meeting appeared to be generally agreed that the fact that shipping in the Gulf is mainly British gave us a strong claim to representation, and that, as regards the question of lighting and buoying, the Foreign Office proposal that Colonel Biscoe’s “two-decker” scheme might be modified by the setting up of two Sub -Committees of\jthe Board, dealing respectively, with the Persian Littoral and the Arab Littoral, w r as one which might well be pursued.

I write in haste because things are not yet ripe for an official despatch, but I feel that you should' have the enclosures as fast as may be. On receipt of Young’s semi-official letter of the 2i th of October, ho . 1096 I sent copies to the interested Departments who have, of course, also had the official despatches and telegra® ho. 069 of the 3.st of October, and I now enclose copies of official letters from th© India Office, foreign Office and air Ministry. We are arranging a discussion as soon as we can, and until the thing has been hammered out and put into an official despatch, we cannot assume that the course suggested by the Foreign Office will, in fact, be adopted, but th© information in their letter - especially the denial of the Persian allegations - may be of value to you in discussing matters with the Iraq Government. We did not answer your telegram No . 599 of th© 25th of November because it crossed our secret despatch of the 30th of November, and my semi-official letter of the same date which carried the documents for which you asked.

(Intld) C.J.I. 22.10.31.(2 5664/622/24) | Dear Anderson, FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 14th November, 1921. Under cover of our official letter to the 'jj l ■; Colonial Office No* E 5456/622/34 of to-day's date (a copy of which has been sent to the India Office) we are sending you a copy of the draft Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board Convention, amended as a result of the decisions taken at the meeting of the 25th September. You will see that in Article 19 we have inserted the additional sentence proposed by you in your letter to Warner No. P.Z.6571/21 of the 16th October, which is shorter than Fitzmaurice*s proposed amendment and seems to us to meet adequately the point raised by Trickett at the meeting. We have made, in addition, a small amendment at the end of the definition of the Port of Basra authori ties in Article 15, paragraph 2 (i), in order to avoid the phrase tT Anglo-Iraqi exchange of notes”. Our Treaty Department have pointed out that .. there 5. Anderson, Esq., D.S.O., M.C. 17 NOV 1931there are technical difficulties about exchanging ratifications of a tripartite convention, and that it is more usual, in such cases, for ratifications to be deposited We have therefore substituted the words 'deposit of 'ratifications' for 'exchange of ratifications' in Article 25, line 2. Moreover, it seems more logical that the duration of the convention should date from the day of its entry into force (i*e. the date of the deposit of ratifications) rather than the day of its signature. We have accordingly substituted the words '’entry into force rT for '’signature” in Article 24, paragraph 2, line 3. Lastly, we have slightly altered the final formula on the last page of the draft in order to bring it into line with the usual treaty form; and we have omitted the reference to the language in which the Convention is to be signed since in the unlikely event of our getting it signed in English only, it seems hardly necessary to mention the language at all, and to suggest to the Iraqis at the present stage that it should be signed in English only seems likely to give rise to a premature discussionof the point, which may render it more difficult to secure our object. It will, however, be necessary to insert some provision about the languages if the Convention is signed in more than one language. We propose to defer for the present consulting Hoare on the best method of approaching the Persian Govern- ment. The fact that the Persians have now raised direct with the Iraqis the question of modifying the Shatt-el-Arab frontier seems to have some bearing on this point, which is of no special urgency, as the Iraqis will have to be brought into line before the scheme is broached to the Persians.

To: The Secretariat, The Heeidenoj, Baghdad. In the course of a conversation which took place between the * Iraqi Minister ilenipoxentiary in Teheran and the iersian Court Minister, Teymourtache referred to the case of the * Iraqi-Jrersian frontier in Sh&amp;tt-sl-Arab and to the wishes of his government to amend it. He stated that when he visited London a few years ago he approached Sir Austen Chamberlain, the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on the subject, and that Sir Austen replied that bis government saw no objection to this if circumstances were favourable to them. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs stated verbally to our Minister ilenipotentiary that his government was compelled to agree to the frontier in Shatt-el-Arab when it was delimitated, and that as the Turkish troops were occupying Urmia, when Persia was unable to face the Ottoman Government, owing to the inefficiency and irregularity of their army, they were compelled to accept that unjust delimitation in order to save their lands which fell in the hands of the Tarts from foreign occupation. The fersian Minister added that the rule followed in the past was to consider the centre of the vi ithe river bed as the frontier line in rivers, but in the case of the frontier delimitation in Shatt-el-Arab the above rule was not followed and the whole of the river was considered to be the property of ’Iraq while rersia was deprived of the water of the river bank. This was prejudicial to the rights of Persia. Concluding, the Minister for Foreign Affairs hoped that the ’Iraqi Government will remove this injustice with which their neighbour was treated, and thus they will prove their friendship and good will* In view of the above, w© shall be glad if you will kindly supply us with all information and. correspon dence available in your office on this case in order to be able to study them fully.

Minister for Foreign AffairsTranslation of Yerj Secret letter If*. 770 dated 30th September, 1931, from the 'Iraqi legation, Teheran, to the Ministry for foreign affairs, Baghdad. hhen I recently met Teymourtach©, before his departure to Surope with the Crown Prince, I told himj- ^Fortunately no important matters which should be settled are outstanding except the question of Mahmud Di&amp;li'. I then entered into the subject of Bizli's question -and discussed it together. This question led us to the proposal he had made and to which I referred in my telegram Mo. 585 dated 30th luguat, 1931. The question of frontier in Shatt-el-arab. The Minister of the Court said that he did not believe that there was anything in this cuestion which necessitated a quick settlement, but, in the contrary, it required patience and attentive consideration. He added that aa this question was an important one to both neighbouring states, it would be kept in mind by both parties. The Minister further added:- f 'Wh 0 n I was in London in 19^, I discussed the question of rectification of the frontier in Shatt-el-Arab with Sir vusten Chamberlain, the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who told me that his government saw eg objection to this if circumstances were favourable to them. The circumstances to which Sir Austen referred were the fear of Britain from arousing the 'Iraqi public opinion, and the avoidance (by Great Britain) lest it will be attributed to them that they were disposing of the land©land8 of Ir&amp;(j fine, 'fclxoii* ws,t©i*s foi* t»ii6 sale© of flio ii* Interests and for facilitating the settlement of their disputes with Persia. Therefore an understanding was ari'ived at regarding the possibility of granting facilities to Persia concerning river navigation, transport, control and other questions needed by Persia. Is it possible for you to inform the 1 Iraqi Government of this our desire in order that there will remain no outstanding questions between us? M I saids- 'When 1 was in a responsible post (? Prime Minister), and when we were dealing with the question of the entry by ’Iraq into relations with Persia, I saw certain correspondence concerning the question of Shatt-el-Arab, but I cannot definitely say that I have seen anything in this correspondence which telle that an understanding exists between you and the English for the grant of facilities in navigation and travel in Shatt-el- Arab. What had appeared to me, as far as I can now recollect, from reading these documents, is that the English did not wish to reject your demand conspicuously, and that they had no courage to approach ’Iraq on this question which remained untalked about during this long period. In addition to the above, and as you have now discussed this question with me, I v/ill convey your point of view to my government in order to receive their instruc tions in this connection. I wish to understand from Your excellency what did you mean by the facilities you are demanding, what kind of facilities would they likelymm be, and how do they appear (? come into existence). Will you please explain?” The Minister replied:- You iEay have lor got ten the details regarding this ease after your perusal of the correspondence concerning it* xou nave not seen the document which we have taken from the British Government regarding their consent in principle to give us facilities in Shatt-el- .rah. If you wish to see this document I will show it to you in the first opportunity”, ”The facilities about which you are enquiring are to allow us to use the waters in Shatt-el-Arab as co-partners and to benefit from them in our capacity as limitro;, he states on Shatt-el-Arab”. 'When we receive the consent of your government for the consideration of this question as far as facilities are concerned, we will then be able to make a suitable arrangement in order to attain this object”. When I left the Minister of the Court I thought that it was necessary for me to see Feroughi, the Minister for Foreign . ffairs, in order to get his views and acquaint myself with what I was unable to get from the Minister of the Court on the subject of this question regarding which Persia is transmitting her voice to us from a distance - a voice which she does not disclose (? confirm in writing) as much as she speaks. On Sunday, 4th September, I visited Feroughi, the Minister for Foreign Affaire# and, after an unimportant conversation on my tour, on what could be done in the case of Mahmud Dizli, and on what has taken place between Teymourtache and myself regarding the visit of His Majesty the King to Teheran, I turned to the subject f &gt; i I 'i fsubject of Shatt-el-Arab whicli Teymourtache discussed with me, and told Ferought of the conversation which took place between Teymourtache and myself in this connection. I then told him that I wished to know the extent of the facilities referred to by the Minister of the Court, and how and through what means they would be confirued. TTie Minister for Foreign Affairs replied:- l? I was thinking of this question and it came to my mind every time I met you and spoke to you, but I did not wish to approach you on the subject in the belief that the time did not come yet, and that the friendly relations existing between the two countries may have necessitated to wait for a longer period. The (expected) visit of His Majesty the king to Teheran made the Minister of the Court seize this opportunity to pave the way for a permanent and sincere friendship* He has done well. H I wish to supply you, as much as 1 can recollect, with information regarding the origin of this case 11 . *Tqu doubtless know that the iersian administra tion were previously leading the country to a very retrogressive state in all their work. Persia, ^y means of this retrogression, was suffering irom poverty and weakness especially in her military forces. mile Persia was engaged in settling matters, in meeting dangers, and in facing the attacks she had by the Russians and Britishers, she was unexpectedly overtaken by the entry of Ottoman troops into the Persian territory and tne occupation by them of Urmia without any reason. It was difficult for Persia, owing to her state of anarchy and weakness, to face the Turks and eject them from her territory.territory* She then tried to avoid the evil as best as she eoul until she arrived at an understanding with the Turks which had led to the delimitation of a general frontier, commencing from the Borth till the Persian Gulf in the South, by a mixed committee of Ottomans, Persians, Britishers and Russians* w ?T It was unfortunate to Persia to see logic trampled under foot and scientific rules conspicuously violated in simple questions such as the delimitation of a frontier. You are aware that when a river forms the frontier line between two states, the n Talwek line 1 , i.e. the centre of the river bed, is considered to be the line separating the two states. Thus the two banka of the said river should be divided between the limitrophe states on that river. This was the international rule which was followed in all delimitations made on rivers. The question of Shatt-el-Arab was followed contrary to the above rule, and therefore the whole of the river was considered to be the property of the Ottoman State, thereby depriving Persia from the waters of that bank, which are necessary for meeting the requirements of her lands on the bank of that river. Persia was unable at that time to announce her unsatisfaction from such an unjust division because she was not in a state through which they could have extended the occupation by the Turks of Persian territory along the frontier. Therefore she was compelled to accept this unjust delimitation in order to avoid a greater evil”. ”These are the events which I have stated in detail. low I will tell you what has taken place between us and the British Government before entering into relations with you”. 'Whento 'When the British GoTornment expressed their desire see * IrsQ, recognised hy us snd to see us enter into political relations with 'Iraq, we discussed with them the question of eorreoting the mistake which was made in the delimitation of the frontier in Shatt^el^Arah* During his tour in London in 19£5, the Minister of the Court discussed this question dSmu? with Sir Austen Chamberlain# There were exchanged between the two governments correspondence of which details I cannot recollect but a few owing to lapse of time. Ghat I can now recollect is that we have first asked the English to agree with us to rectify the frontier in Shatt-el-Ar&amp;b in accordance with the international ruling. ??e found out that they did not object to this but they feared that the 'Iraqi public opinion would criticise them for disposing of the lands of 'Iraq while their political position was not yet defined, and that they did not wish to create means for stirring up evils and for using the political circumstances against them. In addition to the above they promised us to realise (our) wish in a practical manner by granting us assistance and facilities which would in fact be a permission for us to be as equal partners in Shatt-el- Arab in order to enjoy it as if tho frontier was delimitated in accordance with international ruling. We then accepted the above, but, for a reason which I will tell you later on, the ease remained outstanding up to the present date. $Qw I wish to address the 'Iraqi Government sincerely and conspicuously: Do the 'Iraqi Government, who wish to determine be a sincere and true neighbour to us, believe that the delimitation to which w© have referred was just and in accor dance with international ruling concerning the delimitation of rivers? Do your esteemed government wish to perform a courteous snd honourable act towards Persia, their neighbour, and inform her that they are prepared to adjust that prominent mistake on tke frontier? Would it toa possible for His Majesty the king55 oi 'Iraq to seize the opportunity and tell Hie Majesty the Shah, when they meet here, that his government welcome all what is calculated to remedy the injustice made to their neighbour and to strengthen the true friendship between them, thereby pleasing His Majesty the Shah that his (King Faisal's) govern- ment intend to accept the 'ffalwek line- ae the frontier on the river?' ff ilease excuse me for being so frank, in this ease, in stating to you that we think it likelj that the fact should be as we desire it, without procrastination and equivocation, as discussed with the nglish* If the T Iraqi Government find out that the political situation does not help them to perform an 'aete ehevaleresque' we will then b© compelled to give due regard to these circumstances and enter into negotiations which lead to the grant of facilities as previously promised by the British pact a few years ago'* The Minister for Foreign affairs further added:- It was within our reach to arrive at an agreement over these facilities with the English by the conclusion of a tripartite agreement with them and with f Iraq, but as we did not wish to include the British in this case ae a third party w© left the case outstanding up to the present date. I believe that we have done our duty towards 1 Iraq by not attempting to conclude a tripartite agreement, as this act is derogatory to the honour of *Iraq whom we wish should b© strong enough to settle his questions alone'. Here the Minister ended his conversation in which he explained the past events and the details which he remembered before reading the files dealing with the subject, which he promised to read again in order to be sur© of the correctness °T what he had told me, and to refresh his memory of the facilities they are demanding in navigation, transport, peace other question in Shatt-el-Arab, in case ? Iraq does not insider their first point of view, i.e. a conspicuous and 3 * The 31 ^bP^rently words have dropped out 'here.wm. r V xiie tone of t.iie Minister during ills conversation was lenient ana eBibooied a great deal of determination and eonsoiouousnes&amp;• I did not gather that they are keen for a quick settlement of this case, but they attach great importance to it and believe that ^rsq can prove its friendship to Persia by accepting, if possible, the rectification principle, otherwise, they say, the grant of facilities is a question which they have been promised by the English in letters in their possession, fhe above is what I have heard from two responsible men of the Persian State. It may be that I have missed something of what they have said on the subject, but I have kept in mind the important part of their conversations in order to transmit it to you and to give you the chance to think it over and to study the files on the subject. I will let you know of what may- take place later on. In this occasion I consider that you should stuay, if possible, the possibility of a land compensation from Khuaistan or from another direction towards the rectification of the frontier, in case you consider that a rectification is possible* /'i? ,r^r~'-~r-7 — ~—AV-. ■ // TB ; 1 P # B f V (S' •* fASAffiRASE TSLSaaAM from the Acting High Commissioner of Iraq Secretary of State for the Colonies, Dated 21 St October, 1931 , Colonial Office 5,53 p,a, 21st October,, 1931) €■* fst r* aressed to Colonial Office No. 369.

This* view was accepted by the meeting. 15. Colonel HD explained that he hr d an insurance valuation of these assets* which could, if necessary, he admitted to the Iragi and Persian Governments. From this valuation it appeared that 30 lakhs represented very fairly the value, as a going concern, of the tangible assets to be transferred to the Conservancy Bo^rd. in view, howevt r, of the possibility that the Iraqi or Persian Government would not be satisfied with an insurance valuation of the assets, it was agreed that Colonel &lt; ard, on his return, should sum; on a coMm.ittie to r. value them.

It 'was agreed to leave the Article as it stands, with the provisional concurrence of Mr. Triclcett, who ashed whether the Article, a© at present drafted, was sufficient to preclude pay ment being made to the members of the Board from any other source for tb ir services on the Board. It was decided to refer the Point to the Foreign Office Legal Adviser. SQ * (viii) rticle 04.

(lx) Draft Re^mla.tIo ns to oe attached n to, n t^^onys-,ntio|n ItDc^i ginute Paper• Department W'J-Lv ^000 5 30 An Interdepartment Conference attended by representatives of the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, India Office, Admiralty and Treasury with Sir Francis Humphrys and Colonel Ward, Director of the Port of Basra, added, was held at the Foreign Office on the irorning of the 25th September to consider outstanding points in connection with the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Convention. It was agreed (vide p.4 of the note forwarded with the Colonial Office letter of the 24th August - P.Z.5540/31) that it was desirable that the Conservancy Board should be set up before the Port Trust. Sir F.Humphrys strongly advised against any mention of the Conservancy^ Board being made to the Persians before we have secured the concurrence of the Iraq Government in it: this was agreed. As regards tactics, Sir F.Humphrys proposes, after his return to Iraq in November, and after havings if possible * persuaded the Iraq Government to agree to the Convention, to pay a short private visit to Tehran, accompanied by Colonel Ward. During the course of this visit the Minister to raise the question of the Convention with the Persians, it being felt that i , it would hs^ be^ an advantage to him to have the High Commissioner and Colonel Ward on the spot. ; * Negotiations to be opened unofficially in the first instance: when they are placed dn an official footing, the Iraqi Minister# in Tehran ( who is an ex Prime Minister and a useful man) can, if it is thought desirable, 'be called in to assist.The..Conference then turned to discuss the separate articles of the Draft Convention. Article 2. (Vide page 5 of the note forwarded with the Colonial Office letter of the 24th August): it was agreed that it was imst desirable to amend para 2 of this Article so as to secure to the Board |5&gt;ower to intervene to prevent the discharge of inflammable spirit from ships moored alongside the quays. As things are at oresent this difficulty is only likely to arise at Abadan. It was felt that the Persians were not likely to accept a specific reference to Abadan in the Convention. Coxonel Ward then pointed out when the pipe-line is brought to Fao - in 1933 - the same problem will arise on the Iraq shore of the Shatt and suggested that it might be possible to play off Pao against the Persian?, and Abadan against the Iraqis. It was agreed that the Article should be amended so as to cover the question of Intervention on the part of the Board* to safe guard life and property afloat ; in the hopes that it might be found possible to induce the contracting powers to accept it. Article 11. Sir F.Hnmphrys was at first inclined to think that the Iraq Government might fight shy of any mention being made, in the Convention, of the League of Pations ; before they themselves had joined the League. On reconsideration, however ; he thought it probable that he might be able to induce them to accept the Article if he pointed out to them that it would not confer on the League any sort of jvu control the Shatt: that its intention was A merelyMM Minute Paper, i iat ird W'JlA ms rely to make it obligatory for the Board to supply the League with information, on the grounds that the Shatt was used by ships of all nations. Having regard to the views expressed in the Foreign Office letter of the 22nd July (P.Z.4702/31) the Colonial Office and the Admiralty withdrew their objection to this Article, and it was agreed to let it stand in its present form, (I concurred on behalf of this Office) Article 15 and 24. (vide page 5 of note forwarded with Colonial Office letter of 24th August) it was agreed that a definition clause should be added after the words H Port of Basra authorities' so as to make it clear that they included not only the present Directorate but also any Port Trust which may be constituted hereafter in accordance with the provisions of para 5 of the Financial Agreement of the 19.8.30.^/° Article 19. After discussion it was agreed that it was undesirable to make any alteration in this Article, since if the salaries of the members are paid by their repective Governments, and not by the i |Board itself, it will be possible for us to give our 1 I members a larger salary than that which the Persians ■ and Iraqis would consider adequate. Article 15. It was decided to insert the words 'In consideration thereof' at the beginning of the last para of this Article so as to stress the connection between the debt uo Lis Laj©sty s Government and the vessels, plant, etc. oo be ^a^en over. The Board to assume the obligation for the liquidation of the sum of rupees 20 lakhs. Tuere was a 5000 5 :joa good deal of argument on this point. The total amount of the debt is rupees 53 lakhs (which will be i reduced to rupees 51 lakhs next year). The Treasury were in doubts whether they should leave the major portion of the-debt with the Port of Basra Directorate or transfer it to the Board. Finally, dn the advice of Sir Humphrys and Colonel Ward it was decided to leave the major portion (rupees 33 lakhs) with the Directorate ^! | i I fir. faJ&amp;y- J ^£[ oX^J 4395/632/34.

In witness whereofP 2.

The meeting went througjh the draft and decided on the alterations shown therein in pencil. It was agreed that the drafting of the last sentence of Article 9 and of that portion of Article 11 which refers to the communication of the Conservancy Board 1 s report and of 'all useful information” to the League of Nations, together wioh tne question regarding the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company referred to in Colonial Office letter to the Foreign Office of 26th June, No. 83342/31, should be reserved for discussion at a meeting which Sir Francis Humphrys was able to attend. It was also agreed that Article 15 should be discussed direct between the Colonial Office and the Treasury. £ The India Office is directly interested only m one point, lia.., the effect of the establishment of the proposed Conservancy Board on the arrangements for lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf (see last subparagraph of Article 5). The High Commissioner had suggested the omission of the ..hole of this article, for the reasons set out in the memorandum enclosed with his letter to the Colonial Office of 8th hay, on P.Z. 3651/31. The meeting, after considerable discussion, decided - (a) that it was desirable to include a specific reference to dredging and revetting; (b) that it was on the whole definitely desirable to retain the reference to the Conservancy Board having powerto collect dues on behalf of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Service; (c) that it was, however, unnecessary to retain an arbitration provision, and that the last sentence of the subparagraph might therefore be deleted. It was agreed that it was impossible at this stage to take a final decision as to the arrangements to be made for lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf generally, and that it would be impracticable, therefore, to embody any reference to them in the Conservancy Board Convention. Article 11 .- The Admiralty representatives were in favour of deleting all reference to the League of Nations, the . Board of Admiralty being averse to anything which might facilitate the internationalisation of the Shatt-el-Arab. reference to League of Nations control might militate against signature by the Irar^ Government and might equally give rise to difficulties with Persia. The India Office lent a gen n ial sunnort (the noint not directly affecting them) to the Admiralty and Colonial Oxfics, on the general gxound that tne more League interest in the Gulf could be avoided or reduce' 5 ^ **&lt;*?***&lt;*( ri x J- the better. r Sh s e ! £e was reoegm^ten that, having regard uo t special position of Ira foment was not one of very great substance. The Foreign Office, on the other hand, took the view that the Board would be an organisation of sucl a character that, under the Barcelona Convention, read with the Covenant of the League, it would be improper for us to enter into any Convention which did not provide for the submission of an annual report ofproceedings direct to the League of Nations. As stated above, it was decided to leave the point for further discussion with Sir Francis Humphiys, the Colonial Office undertaking in the meantime to draft a compromise/u compromise in which the last subparagraph of Article 11 would be deleted, the first subparagraph remaining as drafted, and the High Commissioner being instructed that we felt it our duty to raise the point involved with the cosignatories to the Treaty but given a certain discretion to omit specific reference to it, * it seemed probable that insertion of the reference could be secured only at the cost of Iraqi refusal to sign the Convention.A ¥ (£.3377.) 88342/31.

I understand that you are arranging an Interdepartmental Conference for the 2nd of July to consider the droit Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board Convention, and I ohinn that it would be a good thing if that Conference were to consider the reply to be returned to the Anglo Persian Oil Company in regard to the points raised in their letter. It is, I suggest, of some importance ohat nothing should be said to' the Company, tie coniGUnication of which to the Persian Govern ment or to the Iraqi Government for that matter - would in any way embarrass the British Representative charged with the negotiation oi the Convention. I hope that Sir F. Humphrys will be able to attend the Conference. He, I know, has decided views as to the manner m which the Convention should be negotiated, and he should, I think, be consulted before any final reply is returned to the Anglo-Persian Oil ... J.

It will he within your knowledge that this work has been in progress for the past six years in conformity with an agreement concluded between the Iraq Government and this Company in 1925. It has now become necessary in our opinion to negotiate a fresh agreement with the Iraq Government for the following reasons, among others “i q p 5 agreement does not deal with the (1) Sor Rookl Channel as eventually adopted. (2) it does not deal g^tely with the questio^^ of he Mel at thl revised depth recently agreed uno'S? nor with possible improvements that may* hereafter be necessary. date, and for the^eriodical^ssessment secure gffaSt for the maintenance of the channel. Our Resident Director in Persia will institute discussions on these lines at an early date. We note, however, that it has been decided to conclude a separate agreement with the Iraq Governmentdealing wi tin ijns Porij o± Basra and ijliatj such agrcsmsirt shall he deemed an integral part of the Treaty of 1930, and we gather that it is intended to constitute a Port Trust on the lines indicated in Article 10 of the Financial agreement annexed to the Treaty of 1922. In this connexion it occurs to us that, whilst in our own interests we should prefer to negotiate a fresh agree ment at once, the Iraq Government may prefer to defer negotiations for a fresh dredging agreement, pending the establishment of the Port Trust, which, it is presumed, would assume responsibility for lighting, buoying and dredging the bar. Our position in the matter is of course one of considerable delicacy, as we have responsibilities both to the Iraq and to the Persian Government, with whose interests and views on the general question of the Shatt-al-Arab you are ^ doubtless familiar. In these circumstances we should be grateful for information, for our guidance, as to the lines on which it is proposed to constitute the Port irust, and as to whether its activities will extend to the Shatt-al-Arab bar, in which we, as a Company, are so vitally interested.

The administration of the lights and buoys in the Persian %lf i8 no t dealt with in the draft Convention. It is probably premature to discuss this question now, but it may eventually prove desirable that the Boa rd should also be responsible for this service in so far as the Perai&amp;n coast is concerned, with possibly a separate body for the Arabian coast. 7. The Kanin river is included in the waters to be controlled by the Board (Article 2) but the upper limit has not been inserted. The decision will no doubt depend largely upon the views of Iraq.. My Lords would be disposed to recormaend that Basra should be the upper limit; and They concur in the proposal (.Article 17) that Basra should be the seat of the Board. 8. There remains for consideration the position which will arise in the event tof war.

The explanatory notes give, I think, sufficient reasons for the =m stiona and, as they are mainly matters of detail, I need not deal with them in. this letter. I consider it essential that His ^jesty* • Government and the 1 1 rani Govpromont should pres nt a united front before any negotiations are opened with I'ernia on the subject of the Board and told Clive when he stayed with me in Baghdad in March that this was my view.

In considering this question one rmist not, I suggest, overlook the fact tost wuen the new freaty with Iraq enters into force, if will * in view of Article 4 - he impose!tit for Iraq to be at war with any htate without the United Kingdom also being at war with that htate, and vice ycrea * lid.s consideration rather merorn down the field of our enquiry. It leaves us, 1 think, with only three possibiliwies to U) /I ^ ja il kaliand, even if it suited our convenience to maintain the Conservancy Board in being, we could only allow them to continue to function under strict military or naval control. In practice, rersia would probably be powerless to resist our wishes, and would have to come into line eventually, nowever, unwillingly. But if, as seems probable, the Conservancy Board were made subject to some degree of League supervision and control, unilateral action on our part to modify the provisions oi the Convention or to circumecrit the powers of the Conservancy Board, might possibly land us in international difficulties \ at Geneva, On the other imiid, there would, I presume, be no likelihood of our being able to induce rersia now to agree to the insertion in the proposed Convention of detailed provision© which would give us the full latitude of action In case ox war that we snould consider necessary, moreover, presumably it is impossible to say now with any degree of certainty wiiat would be our actual requirements in a war. Thus, to attempt to legislate in the present Convention for areferred 'to above* Altuough it a inis at furtheriiig tbe iiigii Co atractirig Parties 1 cotamereial interests in the t&gt;hatt«*el*Arab ( see the Preamble) , it can liarcEy be said to be a treaty of a purely commercial cimracter. Ivor is it a treaty providing for the cession of territory; and, the question whether or not it would be annulled by war between the high Contracting Parties would seem to depend upon the intention of the Parties. In all the circumstances, and as the most satisfactory evidence of the intention of the parties would be the language of the Convention itself, we incline to the view that tne best method would be to insert a clause expressly providing tii&amp;t, in the event of any of the nigh Contracting Parties becoming involved in war, the Convention snail be suspended until p* ace is restored. Phis would not only maice %nt position clear in international law; but it woulc justify our suppressiiig the Conservancy Board In the event of the United Kingdom and Iraq becoming engaged/ 18/1931. Downing St:*@et V, 20tlx March ,1931 Dear Sir Francis, I enclose the provisional draft of a , tripartite Convention for the establishment of the » ? Ti*vention._ w * proposed Shatt-el«Arab Conservancy Board. This draft is still under discussion with the interested Departments here and in the light of the discussions proceeding its provisions may be substantially modified. In particular Article 15, which is still under consideration by the Treasury, is unlikely to remain unaltered. Although the draft is therefore of too teniatire a chare ter for it to he ahown to the Iraq Government at the present stage, it would he of the greatest assistance to the Department here to have now any observations that you may feel able to offer on the draft after informal consultation with Colonel Ward, whose views on the technical aspects of the question would, of course, carry the utmost weight.

Bear Baxter ; It will take some time circulating jour letter ol loth ^he Shatt-el-Arab to the various interested, so x would li^e to make a few preliminarj reraarks on paragraphs 5 to 5 ae the/ go not make quite clear the point 1 desired to emphasise in our telephone co. vers; tion. main point was that the doctrine of nation 1 or ini nd waters, i.e. f that such water© are for purposes of jurisdiction the equivalent of territory, was fully endorsed by ail delegates at the recent Ha t ue Conference* Previously I think there was a little doubt s to whether it was generally accepted* It is the fact that such waters are recognised as equivalent to territory teat seems to me ol great importahee in connectio i with the uhatt-el— rah. 1. your Baxter foreign Office • W * 1Oi. •••••&lt;• ■ 2 - youp letter ,&gt;ou suggest that ny? lASin point was the right to exercise control over national waters. This is, however, a right that also applies of coarse to territorial waters and in some exceptional eases extends even to the high seas. S. I do not understand on what grounds /our legal advisers base the opinion expressed in the second sentence of paragraph &amp; of /our letter, i*e., that ,3 sinee the Persian frontier follows one bank of the river and comes down to the water of the river, the Shstt-el-Arab must be said to separate Persia, and Iraq.' 3 • This may be correct from a geographical point of view, but from a legal point of view, I should have thought that, ns the waters of the river are wholly Iraq territory, it could not be claimed that the river separated the two countries any more than a strip of land on the Persian side of the frontier could he ssid to separate them. Where e river separates two countries, surely the frontier follows the median line or the Thalweg { 1 i I 1of the river. 4. A point is also m,:de in paragraph 5 of your letter of the fact that all the waterways to which the convention a j.plies are national waters. This naturally fallows as all rivers are wholly national /(/ waters. There is, however, I think, an important difference, as other waterways that come under the convention are, at least in some sections of their courses, the national waterways of more than one State whereas the Shatt-ei—Arah is the national waters of one country only. it is irue there is a small area off Mohammerah conceded to Persia by treaty, but I scarcely think this car affect the position under the Convention. 5. You also remark that the convention applies indeed to waterways of which botji b belong to one State if such waterways traverse more than on^ te. This ie, however; solely oecause they traverse more then one State, i.e., for portions of their navigablecourses both bamcs do not belong to one State. o. I agree of course that if the Shatt-el- Arab comes under the Convention then the whole of its naturally navigable portion is covered. I should also be inclined to the view that the Tigris (assuming this ano not tne Euphrates is the main riverj would also be covered. Eor the purposes of the convention the main river would presumably be the one which is navigable for the greater distance. 7. I presume the Tigris (or Euphrates) in its upper reaches in Syria or Asia Minor is not navigable. If it were, then the whole river would come under the Convention as traversing different States if the Tigris (or Euphrates) and Shatt-el-Arab have to be regarded as one river for the purposes of the convention 8. I am sending copies of this letter to Orimehaw, Hall, haithwaite and TricEett. Yours sincerely,f Z- M £ 3/ !■ OLf^. «,/ 3 Proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board. m / A f The revised draft Convention setting up a Board to improve and maintain the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab enclosed in the Foreign Office letter to the Colonial Office on P.Z. It44/31 below, embodies the various ^ggootion: worked out at the Interdepartmental meeting on 23th November in the draft on this subject originally prepared by the Foreign Office. The chief concern of the India Office is to safeguard the position of the Persian Gulf Lighting and Buoying Board and the draft in its present form seems adequately to do this. It appears, however, otherwise also to be unobjectionable/i^a- ca-v ^ . The covering correspondence makes it clear (Foreign Office letter to Admiralty of 16th larch) that the Shatt must be regarded as a waterway of international concern as far upstream as Kfcrna, and possibly even above; that the Conservancy Board, if established, must be deemed under Article 14 of the Barcelona Statute to be an organisation referred to in Article 2d of the Covenant of the Leag ue, and that the provisions of Article 24 of the Covenant and Article 14 of the Statute will apply to it; and finally, that it is doubtful whether there is any means of ensuring that Conservancy Board shall not be placed sooner or later under the direction of the league; 'Whether League direction will in practice lead to such interference and control on the part of the League is a different question.' The important point raised in the penultimate paragraph of the Foreign Office letter of 16th March to the Admiralty - via .. the position regarding a Convention in the event of any of the High Contracting Parties becoming involved ir war - is not directly a matter for this Office, and we may j await the result of investigation of it by the interested vijl Departments. /!

These meetings were attended by representatives of the Colonial Office, Treasury, Foreign Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry, India Office and the Board of Trade.The file also contains accounts of negotiations that took place between British officials and Persia's First Minister, Abdolhossein Teymourtash (written as Teymourtache in the file). A telegram in French that was sent by Teymourtash to Francis Humphrys, Britain's High Commissioner in Iraq in April 1932 can be found on folio 106.Also enclosed in the file is a draft of a 'Treaty of Residence and Neighbourly Relations' between Iraq and Persia (folios 400-402).
