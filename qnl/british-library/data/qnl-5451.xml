The‘excess mainly appears uncer Office Allowance, Launch and Medical Grants and is due partly to abnormal rise in prices and partly to the grant of Dearness Allowance and free rations to the inferior establishment paid from these grants.

They are of opinion that such celebrations will have an excellent eiiect on the x-ublic morale, provided they are not of a character to surest to the mamiormed and simple-minded that the end of the war with Japan is in si^t, or that there is the least justification for relaxing the war effort* As regards the war against the Japanese, it must be clearly borne m upon the public that the victory over Germany, although of ^:eat importance, will not in any way lesson the need for great sacrifice and effort which will oe necessary oefore final victory against the Japanese can be attained. 3* In order that the victory over Germany, when it comes, will not find civil and military authorities unprepared, the general outline of a provisional programme is given below. I am to exp res ? the hope that pro vincial and local civil authorities, in cooperation with His Majesty s Forces wherever these are at present, and influential members of the public will unite in an endeavour to'make the ceieorations a success. 4*5.

Apart from ceremonial parades, uhe Government of India would wel come the arrangement of any festivities which gave an opportunity for fraternisation between the civil and military, such as joint sports or the entertainment of soldiers by civilian organisations. In this connection a further Jetter will be addressed to provincial Governments and Ghief Commissioners by the Department of Information and broadcasting. 7. tecessary instructions are under issue to the paval.

Your letter of the 14th January, concerning the partition of Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia and elsewhere between His Majesty’s Government and tne Government of India. We agree that the proposal of tne India Office to raise the limit of fresh expenditure, beyond which each government is under an obligation to consult tne other, from £100 to £1,000 a year is a useful one under war conditions, but feel tnat complications might arise in times of peace. Therefore vie would suggest that tne proposal be agreed for the duration of t^e war only. We presume that if you concur we should ask for formal Treasury authority which will supersede (temporarily) that of the 31st October, 1906 (5633/06) which governs our present practice.

I do not know if your interest in Indian afiairs covers the whole of the , round or wnether it is limited to matters concerning defence, but il the question about vdiicn I 6 U 2 i now writing does not fall within your sphere perhaps you would be good enough to pass my letter to t.ue rignt quarter. You probably know tnat diplomatic and consular expenditure arising in connection with Persia and Persian Gull is shared between H.M.G. and India on wnat originally purported to be a fifty-fifty basis. Each Government mans and initially pa,ys for certain consulates and each is under an obligation to obtain the consent of the other to any fresh expenditure of more than £100 a year on any consulate in its jurisdiction. j.his is of course all veny fine ana large in normal times, but it seems to me in present circumstances tnat we might very well consider raising this limit to something a little more reasonable. I nave, for instance, just had put before me a long reference frcm a consul at one of the Foreign Office consulates regarding an increase in the cost-of-living allowance for the subordinate staff of the consulate. An elaborate case nas been made out which has been supported by Tehran to tne Foreign Office who nave put it to the Treasury and to us for concurrence. We should normally refer it to tne Goverrment of India and if they agreed to bear their half—share we should report tneir concurrence to tne Foreign Office who (if the Treasury also agreed) would tnen notify the consul tnat his proposals had been approved. Tne total amount involved in all this elaborate correspondence is some £130 a year which is to be divided equally between tne two Governments! It does seem to me tnat in present circumstances it is absurd to insist on this elaborate procedure being gone through over matters of such trifling importance. What with delays in the post and congestion on tne wires I tnink a reasonable attitude might be conceded to men on tne spot, but the Treasury and the Government of India might see objections to this. J.H.E. Woods, T isq., M.V.0. Treasury.&gt;r C , L . J- I do not, however, think tnat the Government of India would be likely to object if the limit, within wnich the two Goverments could sanction expenditure without consulting each otiier, were raised from £100 a year to say £1,000 a year and I should hope that if this were done a number of references at present necessary could be dispensed with. If the Treasury are prepared to agree, as I hope tney will be, we will consult the Government of India in tne matter. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) F.E.Grist.FILE COPY No. F. 146-ii/41.
