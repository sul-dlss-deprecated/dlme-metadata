H. B. M’s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum:- Until comparatively recently we have had no cause to complain about the behaviour of the British, American and Indian troops in Bahrain but during the last two or three months I have received a number of complaints, very often vague and with no evidence sufficient for identification, about troops interfering with women in the villages. It is stated that people in military cars pursue women and try to catch them. On Friday last an incident took place in the garden of Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa near the Portuguese Fort. It appears that two American soldiers, members of a party who with an officer were visiting the fort, got hold of a village girl and attempted to molest her. Shaikh Mohamed was in his garden and sent for the Police who got into touch with the U.S.A. provost officer who took over the two men and removed them under arrest. I understand that they are being dealt with by the military authorities. It is most undesirable that incidents of this kind should occur now to spoil the record of the troops stationed in Bahrain. To prevent such incidents I think all villages should be put out of bounds for troops and that they should be forbidden to enter gardens, which are in any case private property. It may be that orders already exist on this subject if this is so I think the Bahrain Govern ment should be informed so that if cases are seen of troops entering villages the fact can be reported to the military authorities.
