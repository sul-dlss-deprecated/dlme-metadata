CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2112/266/25] No. 1. Gonsul-General Biscoe to Colonial Office.—[Communicated to Foreign Office, April 27.) (No. 10. Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, March 31, 1932. IN paragraph 4 of my despatch No. 2 of the 5th February, 1932, regarding my visit to King Ibn Sand, I mentioned that among the subjects discussed was the possibility of some consular status being afforded to Nejdi representatives in Bahrein and Koweit. 2. I now have the honour to amplify somewhat the brief reference to this subject therein made. The question was raised by Yusuf Yasin in the course of one of our lengthy nightly discussions, and he began by asking me whether it would not be possible to accord some consular status to a Nejdi representative at Bahrein. I replied by saying that he knew how delicate was the position at Bahrein vis-a-vis the Persians, who had not yet abandoned their claim ; that there was a very large Persian colony at Bahrein, and that if we allowed the Hejaz-Nejd Government to have a consular representative the Persians would inevitably put forward a similar demand: in fact they had already made a request to this effect, to which His Majesty's Government had not acceded. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin admitted the force in this contention and did not press the matter any further in respect of Bahrein, but went on to ask whether it would not be possible to give some sort of official status to Nafisi, Ibn Sand's trade agent at Koweit, since, as far as he was aware, there were no difficulties with the Persians at that place. I replied that this was not altogether correct: the Persians did not claim Koweit, but did not recognise it and impounded Koweiti passports if brought to Persia, &amp;o. It would, in my opinion, be extremely undesirable to allow the Persians to have a consular representative at Koweit for reasons which he would doubtless appreciate; but if any consular status was accorded to Nafisi we could hardly refuse a similar concession to the Persians, who had a large number of subjects in Koweit. He saw the force of this argument and did not press the matter further. ^ I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Jeddah and to the Government of India. A I have, &amp;g. H.

To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. / /i Sir, \ I have the honour to refer to jour letter No:^24-S dated the 9th April 1932 and to forward herewith a copy of the proposed extradition treaty between the Bahrain G-overnment and the G-overnment of the Hedjaz ani Nejd. 2. This treaty has been drawn up on the lines of the Hedjaz-Iraq^ treaty and the only alteration of importance is •f In 1 fv that evidence should be on oath before a Qadhi. 3. You will notice that the demand for extradition will be made through the Political Agent at Bahrain. The Hedjaz Government may object to this as the idea did not appear to commend itself to Yusif Yasin in Iiof /uf,but unless the rule which provides that correspondence of foreign author ities with the State must be through the Political Agent be waived,this would appear to be the proper course. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant, . ? Political Agent, Bahrain. W 1 1 I 1 I ■ ■ 1 H I ■ I ir I I41 i! b3 V ''J Confidential , D # O.Ho,496-S of 1932* The Residency # Bushire, the 15th %ruly 1932. % X . r r mm r J' Will you please refer to your letter ao # C/ll9 of the 10th July 1932 forwarding a draft of a proposed Extradition Treaty between the Bahrain Government and the Cxovernment of Hej az-XJej d# I have been through this and should like your comments vj on the following points. I note that in Article 3 you have inserted that the surrender of escaped slaves shall not be permissible. This does not appear in the 'Iraq-Uejd treaty, and, as you know, the question of slaves is rather a live issue and rather a delicate matter at present in the Hejaz. It seems to me that what will probably happen is this; a slave will run away from Kaaa, the Uejd people will accuse him of theft and will not say that he is a slave, and the man when brought before the Bahrain Courts will plead that he is an escaped slave. *Vhat do you propose to do about ll it ? Further he may not be a slave at all, but may merely be a servant who has run off with some of his masters goods, but if he claims to be a slave it will give him a loop-hole to avoid extradition, and I think may involve the Bahrain Government in possibly acrimonious discussions with I&gt;iejd. Is it worth while inserting these extra words ? Now, as regards the last portion of Article 4. I agree that demajnds for extradition should go through the Political Agent, and what we actually want in practice, if we are to get a rapid and simple procedure is for Bin Jiluwi to send his demand through you, and you to send your demand to Bin Jiluwi. Thf regular legal procedure presumably would ... Prior, I.a Political Agent Bahrain,a !U) 9 -2- would be for the Hejaz-Hejd C/overnment to submit their demand to Minister, Jedda, who would forward it to you, and similarly for the Bahrain Crovernment to submit their demand to you for transmission to Hinister t Jedda, I am disposed to think there- fore that this is the procedure that should be laid down in the treaty; but that notes should be attached to the treaty in which | the two parties should agree that with a view to expediting the arrest of an absconder, the Governor of Hasa in the case of Hejdis ( as opposed to Hejazis) in addition to addressing his own Government at Mecca, should be entitledd simultaneously to send you direct the requisite documentary evidence with a request for the detention of the individual concerned and an intimation that a formal application will in due course be received via Jedda, and similarly you should be entitled, in addition to addressing Minister,Jedda, to send the Governor of Hasa direct a copy of the evidence, etc., with a request that he will detain the individual concerned pending receipt of a formal application for extradition, through Minister,Jedda. I have drafted a revised version of this portion of the Article and attach it herewith. As you will see it prescribes the orthodox procedure which, if my suggestion is accepted, would be supplemented by the exchange of notes authorising direct communication between the Political Agent and the Governor of Hasa in the case of J^ejdis escaping to Bahrain or Bahrainis escaping to Hejd. The orthodox procedure described in the treaty would be followed in the case of a Hejaai escaping from Jedda and making his way to BaJarain and vice versa; such oases would be few. The procedure in the notes would-be followed in the case of Hejais escaping to Bahrain and vice ▼ersa» I may mention that it is not correct to speak of a Political Agent as H.B.M.'s Political Agent, since this term-3- is for officials such as consular and diplomatic officers who hold coinmissions* I should be grateful if you could let me have a reply before the 4th August^ when I hope to proceed on leave.Revised version of the last portion of Article 4 of the proposed Extradition Treaty between the 3ahrai n Grovernment and the Grovernment of Hejaz and ife^d. A demand for extradition made by the tfovernment of Hejaz, ^ejd,and Dependencies to the (xovernment of Bahrain shall be addressed to His Majesty's Minister, Jedda, who will transmit it to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for communication to the Government of Bahrain And a demand for extradition made by the Government of Bahrain to the Government of Hejaz, Uejd and Dependenci shall be addressed to the Political Agent, Bahrain, who will transmit it to His Majesty^ Minister, Jedda, for communication to the Government of Hejaz r Nejd and Dependencies. • •Oonfident ial. D.0.No:0/l45. ? ol i ti c a 1 ^genc y ? Bah.rain, the 131h August 1932. Tlould you please refer to the late Sir Hugh Biscoe T s D.0Jfo:4S6-3 dated the 15th July 1932. 2. I referred the matter to Shaikh Hanad and Belgrade and neither of them see any reason for altering the slave clause and consider that whether it is./inserted or not the Nejd Government will attempt to recover escaped slaves. However, since the onus of any unpleasantness that may ensue will fall on the Agency,Shaikh Hamad views it with equanimity, ^ctually Shaikh Hamad is very mildly interested in the treaty and only embarked on it 'because we invited him to consider it and 'because,he thinks,it will please Bin Saud. 3. I see no reason at all for omitting the slave clause. The Hedjaz/lTejd G-overnment may dislike it hut,on the other hand,we are bound to check the trade in every possible way and it is as well that they should understand where they stand from the beginning. Accusing escaped slaves of theft would certainly be one of their first moves under the treaty and,as you know,in all Indian States the standard method of attempting to obtain extradition of women,who run away to escape persecution^is to accuse them of stealing ornaments-. 4. The moving factor behind the treaty is the 'Sffendi-isirr of Bin Saud T s Syrian advisers, not ably Yusif iasin,and I have always thought that it would be an unmixed nuisance and will certainly tighten Nejdv control over their subjects here. 5. The revised version of Article 4 is acceptable to the State. 6. The Political Agent may not be TT H.B.M T s Political Agent but he certainly is ;!

Bahrain—enclosing a draft of a treaty on the lines of the Hejaz-Iraq Agreeraent- r rhere ensued soi/ie correspondence between 3ir Hugh aiid Prior on the point of the insertion, or omission, of a clause stating that escaped slaves should not be surrendered* Prior was for the insertion of such a of having ouch a treaty at all! On general principles the fewer agreements we have with the semi-civilised potentates and Shaikhs of Arabia the better, when a treaty is made His Majesty's Govermnent abide by the letter and the spirit, or sec to it that their proteges—if it is the latter who have made the agreement—do so. The Arabian poS^ntate generally abides by neither the spirit nor the letter. With regard to the proposad treaty in particular. Prior writes: A reply was received from Prior—Political Agent, What I can make up my mind on is the und e sir alii ity 'The K8 *. C.JI.O., O.B.K.. ■onial Office. in -Wk idon.'The Moving factor toehincl th« treaty is the 'Effencli-ism H of Bin aaud's Syrian adviBers, notably Yusif Yasin. and I have alwayo thought that it would be an unmixed nuisance and will certainly tighten Kejdi control over their subjects heret? With regard to the slave question he says: . 'However, since the onus of any unpleasantness that nay ensue will fall on the Agency, Shaikh Hamad views it with equanimity. Actually shaikh Hamad is very mildly interested in the treaty and only embarked on it because we invited him to consider it and because, he thinks, it will please Bin baud.* 4 4* Generally speaking I agree with iVior* Instead of the treaty leading to more amicable relations between Bahrain and Wejd I am afraid that it will have the opposite effect of raising unpleasant questions between the two parties, into which we shall of course be dragged* Hor does there seem to be any crying need to alter the present position* Even when no extradition treaty exists a atate, at its own discretion, can always surrenaer a fugitive from another country* In fact its powers are, in a sense, wider than under a treaty where the offences for which an offender can be extradited, and the procedure to be followedj are meticulously laid down* 'rhus in any particular case, Banrain could always give up a man 'wanted' by Jaejd, and vice versa * r fhe suggestion for the treaty has come from ibn baud, or rather-—as i ^rior suggests-—from his 'Kffendi' Syrian Adviser: Yusif Yasin* Yhere is no reaeon at present why we should go out of our way to please Ibn aaud—rather the contrary, if ibn baud really wants the treaty he will doubtles put up the matter again through air Andrew hyan; and if he is luke-warm about it a he wo^t. If Ibn liaud does pursue the matter/matter I have got the Bahrain draft here ready, ana can give my views.

You are aware that by the Grace of God and endeavour of His Majesty the King, there exists sufficient number of law Courts and Customary Courts in our country. As a practice, the case starts in the country of the defendant. Many claims and suits filed by people of Bahrain against our subjects have been settled by us according to justice and equity. By the Grace of God not a single person received injustice in our hands. On receiving the information, I did not like to raise the matter to His Majesty the King but considered it advisa/ble to communicate to you. Under the circumstances, God willing, if any person 1ms a cla. im, big or small, aga.inst any person from ainong our subjects, he will come to us direct or through you according to the prevalent custom between you and us. You will write to us about the matter and we in return will inform you what actually happens.

I am inclined to reply,if a reply proves necessary, that the Courts in Bahrain have worked for many years and given justice and that there is no custom in our Courts that a case must be instituted in the Courts of the defendant,and that I fear that possibly some ill disposed person may have made statements to which I hope that he will not listen. That any big change in procedure would need discussion with His Majesty the King but that in this case a continuance of the old procedure which by the grace of God has worked well for many years seems best. Hope he is well etcetera. 3. I understand that since the death of his son in the Rebellion Ibn Jiluwi gets times when he is mentally affected so that any one can get him to sign anything. 4.

Weightman, Esquire, T Political Agent, Bahrain The Konoura'ble the Political Piesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit of the Amir Saud to Bahrain. 2* The Prince arrived at Kanamah on the 15th December 1937 by launch. He had been met on the mainland by Shaikh Mohammad bin ' Xsa anc, by Shaikh Salman bin Hsxri^.d, respew'vi» elder brother and eldest son of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. He was accompanied by two of his brothers, three cousins and a nephew, and by about 40 follower's cT . ser-zpn --c* 3. He was met on arrival by tT is Highness the Shaikh and the A1 Khalifah Family, by the Political Agent, and by the officers of the Bahrain Administration. The arrangements for the reception 8t the Customs pier were adrnj-rable in every way, but the dignity cf the ceremony was sadly marred by the uncontrolled behaviour of the Saudlsn xdlowers, who swarmed off the launches and reduced the reception to some thing more akin to a foot -ball scrimmage. The Amii ^aud, in striking contrast, deported himself with dignity and calm. It was however a thoroughly uncomfortable affair, pro - would not recommend that the Political Agent should be pre sent at any similar arrival in future. It is true that on this occasion no one was pushed off the pier into .-he &amp;€«, but the possibility of an exit in this manner is by no means remote•/- :)remote» A big crowd assembled, outside the pier gates to see the procession, which was accompanied by a pandemonium of horn blowing by the drivers of the cars, who apparently were not impressed by the fact that the route had been cleared. 4. The Amir Saud stayed at the Palace in Manamah and on the first night dined quietly with His Highness the Shaikh at Sakhir. this being followed on the next three nights by dinners at the houses of Shaikhs Mohammad, Abdullah and Sal man. On these nights no European guests were invited. Tt is amusing to note the local view that the date of the visit had been suggested to the Amir Saud by his companions and followers in order to coincide with His Highness the Shaikh's Anniversary Celebrations, as these are usually marked by a certain loosening of normal restraint, with a consequently greater expectation of pleasant adventures in the town. Tt appears from reports that they were not disappointed. 5. On the 16th December, T called on the Amir Saud, ac companied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and by the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, His Highness the Shaikh, most of the A1 Khalifah Family, and other notables were present, and the ceremony was adequate. A friendly note was struck by an invitation to me from the Amir Saud to visit him in his own home in the near future. 6. On the 17th December, T called on His Highness the Shaikh at the Palace, again accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, on the occasion of the AJiniversary Celebrations* The Amir Saud was present and informed me of his wish to return my call. The return call took place '^■r ■mimwnrwi....m. u nni' '' ' the following morning, December the 18th, His Highness the Shaikh accompanying the Amir Saud. The visit lasted about 20 minutes. In the afternoon of December 18th the Amir Saud accompanied His Highness the Shaikh to the annual Municipal Garden/-Garden Party given in honour of the latter, when the usual laudatory speeches were delivered* 7. On the 19th December, the Adviser to the Bahrain Go vernment gave a dinner party in honour of the Prince, at which ladies were also present. This was followed by large dinner parties on the two succeeding evenings at the Palace and at the house of the Saudi an Agent in Bahrain, the days being occupied with hawking and Arab dances. 8. On the last evening of the visit the Amir Saud and Kis Highness the Shaikh accompanied by six of the former's and three of the latter 1 s relatives dined (Arab fashion) at the Agency. By this time the Saudian brothers and cousins, who had been very silent at the beginning of the visit, had thaw ed considerably and were quite animated. The Amir ^aud, who throughout had been most friendly and charming, was almost affectionate. He was certainly most outspoken, one of his comments being that it was high time that England used her increasing strength to give Italy a sharp lesson, as the latter country appeared to be completely out of control. The more peaceful suggestion that while one might forge a sword one need not necessarily use it, was greeted with an unbelie ving smile. 9. The Saudian party left for the mainland on Thursday morning, the 23rd December. The visit has b een an unquali fied success and every one is very pleased. So far as I can discover its 'privete'* nature has been carefully maintained, and there have been no real political discussions. The fol lowing items of reported conversation are, however, of interest (1) The Amir Saud is reported to have said that he was very pleasantly surprised to find that the A1 Khalifah Family was not held down in a position of inferiority in Bahrain, without prestige or pov/er, as he had so frequently heard from other/-'903 - ^ 'v •3^ , ii ether sources. He realised now that the stories of Bri tish interference are untrue and that His Highness (act- ing with the Al Khalifah Family) was left to exercise freely his prerogatives as Ruler♦ (ii) The Prince exhibited very great interest in oil, and on a visit to the Bahrain Cil Company*s Refinery made notes of production and royalty figures. He remarked that the third share of the royalties received by His Highness amounted to a very large sum of money, but said that he realised that His Highness was extremely hospitable and generous to the poor5 and that he felt sure that the money was bising well spent» (iii) On one occasion Shaikh Mohammad bin 'Isa, brother of His Highness the Shaikh, raised the question of Zubarah. He became extremely excited and shrill saying that it was unbearable that the Al Thani should seize the home and tombs of the Al Khalifah Family. His Highness rebuked his bro ther for his vehemence, and the Prince remarked that this was a subject about v/hich men might well become vehement. After all, he said, the Al Thani were nothing but animals 1 This, so far as I can discover, is the only gtustifi- cation for the bazaar rumour that the main object of the Amir Saud f s visit was to effect a reconciliation betv/een Bahrain and Qatar. 10. It is interesting to note that the Saudian party 0 brought a great deal of gold to Bahrain, one report putting it as high as 25 to 30 thousand sovereigns. Some of this had been left here in return for services rendered and a good deal more was spent in purchasing Maria Theresa dollars It appears that a duty of 20% was imposed last month on the import of dollars into Hassa, following large arrivals ofAy cf this coin minted in Belgium. The Bahrain bazaar was short of dollars but 7C,00C coins were brought in by mail and were bought by the Saudi Arabian party, on which they will make their 20% profit, as of course the Prince 1 s party will be able to avoid the payment of duty in Hassa. They are also taking with them 11 motor cars presented b^r His Highness the Shaikh, some of them new and others rather part-worn. Cash presents to servants and followers amounted to at least Hs. 20,000/- and they have all been given new outfits of clothes. The cost to His Highness the Shaikh however has, I imagine, been well within Rs. one lakh, and so far as he personally is concerned he has enjoyed himself enormously throughout the visit, though he was beginning to look a little tired towards the end. The State will of course pay the bill for entertainment at the Palace, but this should not be a very great sum. 11• There has been a certain amount of comment in the town on the extraordinary precautions which the Mir Saud took for his protection at night. He moved from the room prepared for him in the Palace to a smaller room on a high er floor, and the arrangement of the furniture was changed frequently. Every one is satisfied that such danger as was apprehended came not from Bahrain but from his own entourage, which included his cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Mohammad. 12. It may be interesting to report that the Amir Saud received a telegram from his father three days after his arrival tellnng him to return not later than December the 21st as there was a great deal of work for him to do at home. The local expectation is that he is to be charged with duties corresponding roughly with those of a Foreign Minister./-o r n onf ^ tile Hesidency, Busnire, tne 3rd January, 1938. t^Q.Mcu12*3« OIL In continuation of India Office telegram jso .2431 of tne 5th October 1937 I enclose herewith an interesting report from feightiaan on the Amir Saudis visit to Banrain, which X am very pleased to note was un un^ualiiied success* 2. On arrival His Boyal Highness's followers, in contrast to his own dignified behaviour, apparently conducted thetaselves rather like hooligans, and tnere was some danger of members of the reception party being jostled off tne pier # I am glad that the Shaikh and tfeightman escaped immersions. The Saudians (paragraph 4 of weightmar^s report) also enjoyed themselves in connection witn the Anniversary delebrations of His High ness tne Shaikh. However, boys will be boys, and Saudians will be Baudians, especially when they come up to Town from their native wilds. 3. The Amir Saud and ?eightman evidently 'clicked 1 (paragraph 8 of //eightman's letter), and His Royal Highness made the same favourable impression on '/eightman as he has, I believe, on all tne British officials whom ne nas met. 4. The ^guir Saud's opinion as to the position of the Al Khalifah family (paragraph 9 (l) of v^^eigntman , s letter) is a most gratifying commentary on our policy in Bahrain of guiding the Ruler, but at the same time of allowing him to run his own affairs, all the more gratifying just at tne present moment when propaganda is appearing in the Arab Press iir Aubrey MetoaXfe, K.O.I.3., C.S.

The Shaikh got off reasonably lightly over the Tisit with less than one lakh of rupees expenses. I had an uneasy suspicion that the Amir 3aud f in view of the fact that His Highness is now a rich man, on behalf of his father might have seized the opportunity of ^touching' him for a loan, or getting a furtner concession from him over the transit dues. His Highness is araiable to the point of weatoiess, and might well nave agreed. However, evidently this suspicion was an unwortny one.

As you will remember the Bahrain Government erected marks H on those islands which they claimed when it was first proposed to divide the Unallotted Area between the two oil companies. It has been fairly general unofficial knowledge that the local Saudi officials in A1 Khobar and Dahran resented the erection of the mark on one of the two islands called the Bainain. There is no __ ' .. island between Bahrain and Hasa which is known locally as Libainaf 9 \ and presumably the present objection by the Saudi Government is in respect of either Bain-al-Kebir or Bain-as-Saghir.

These two islands come within the, scope of those indicated in , Ll 13 ^ *so Paragraph 3 of India Office letter No.P.2.2904/38, dated the 29th April 1938, to Petroleum Concessions Limited, since they are definitely mentioned in the first paragraph of the description of the boundary of the area to be offered by the Bahrain Governmesnt to Petroleum Oorscessioaa Limited annexed to feight man's Sxpress letter No. 33 5-10/14, dated the 22nd May 1938. ^ ^ It seems to me obvious that the Libainat ('Libainaf') are the % same islands referred to by the Political Agent, Bahrain, as Bain-al- ebir and Bain-as-Saghir. The ♦a 1 of the article ♦al 1 has been omitted / S. 6.-2- oiaitted and the regular feminine plural •at' used instead of the dual plural ^ain*. 4. It would appear therefore from the Jedda telegram that the Saudi GoTernment lay claim to both islands, though from Weightman*8 Express letter it would seem that the objection of the Saudi local officials has been directed only against the erection of a mark on one of the islands, 5# The two islands in question are shown in Lorimer as belonging to Bahrain - vide page 214, Volume !!• As 1 under stand it f a claim to doubtful territory can be set up by a State by (a) the erection of a flag supported if possible by (b) proof of some form of H administration*, or connection with it by usage i.e. calling there of ships. It is obvious that no question of administration arises with regard to the two islands referred to, as they are mere sand banks. Therefore the one proof of possession would appear to be the erection of a flag, or a cairn or other mark. In the present instance it is the Bahrain State which has erected a mark on the islands in question. Further, of these islands, lain-al-ICebir is only some 6 miles from Bahrain mainland - Ma»ari.-,h Island -, and some 9 miles from the Saudi mainland (i.e. the Hasa coast), and Bain-as-3aghir some 9 miles from Bahrain and 6 miles from Hasa. finally Bain-as-Saghir is within 5 miles of Imi Na 1 san island i # e. within the territorial waters of that island which undoubtedly belongs to Bahrain* In all the circumstances my own opinion is that these islands definitely belong to Bahrain. This being so I do ♦ not /not think there is any necessity for a meeting with the Saudi authorities. sd. T.C.Fowle. Political Resident in the Persian (Julf.

Z. 7831/3'' of the 30th November in which was enclosed - an express letter from Powle on the subject of the Saudi Arabian claim to the Libainat Islands* 2. Although geographical contiguity b./ itself is never a good ground for a territorial clai-;i it seems that in the case of Bain-al-S aghir» Bahrein have a strong priiaa facie claim owing to the fact that it 11 s i , the territorial ^a«ers ^ another island, Umm ia sa ^hich, accordin- o Powle, undoubtedly oes belong to Bahrein. 3« On the other hand, Bain-al-Kabii^ does lot lie in any territorial waters an the fact that this islet is three miles nearer Bahrein than the Hasa coast does not prove anything, In order zo establish t. at Bain—al—Kabir belongs to her, Bahrein will therefore either have to produce some evidence Ox pre-existing sovereignty and maintain tn t as the Sovereign Power she is .juctifioc in erecting a mark (if it was indeed on this island hat the mark: was erected) or performing any other act of sovereignty: or else admit — and maintain - that the island was res nuliius and that by erecting a mark on it she has .en the first to occupy it, nd has thereby become the sovereign Power. ^-^7 5* It seems however rrom Weigjitman's letter of the 5th I,o/ember that the Saudi objection io in respect of • Gibson, Esq,,Bain-al -Saghir&gt; which is nearer to the Hasa coast l)ut which Bahrein can claim on stronger grounds. 6.

In the absence of any further information we should have felt disposed to agree with you that as the next step the political ^igent might be ashed to find out from the local Saudi authorities what precisely is the territory, i/e have, however, as I mentioned to you recently, certain additional information indicating that the Saudi claim is in respect of one island only, viz. the island on which a mar^c has been put up by the Bahrein Government, that this mark; which is described as an empty painted barrel, is understood to have been Greeted in June last or thereabouts, and that the island, referred to as ^1 Lubainah, is said to be about 7 miles from the mainland and 9 miles from Bahrein. This/i; This information3 vhioh reaches us from a reliable source confirms the political Agent's suspicion that the island in question is Bain-as-Saghir. Although of coarse we cannot make use of this information officially there seems in the light of it no necessity for the suggested meeting between 'Jeightman and the local Saudi representativep and indeed it might cause embarrassment 'by provoliing a dispute over the ownership of Bain-al ~I\eMr also. In the circumstances we think we might safely deal with the Saudi Government on the assumption that it is the island Bain-as-Saghir that is in question, and if you agree we suggest that Bullard might he asked to reply that it is assumed that the Saudi G-overnment refer to the islet known locally as Bain-as-3aghir ? that this islet lies within the territorial waters of Umm Na'san island, which 'belongs to Bahrein9 and that in the view of His . la jesty's Government the Bahrein Government acted properly and within their rights in erecting a visible sign of their ownership on it. j. p, osnsaQp ! i IConfidential D,C. No. C/200-A gpoj-nn c p.EQ^r.NCY. j 1 '!d co T rs otial records Dated the 28th March 1939. / I understand that it is now pretty definite that Tbn 3aud is coming to Dharan and Ras Tanura for the opening of the port at the^latter place about the 1st of May. His Highness the Shaikh sent him a telegram the other day inviting him to come over to Bahrain but received an extremely polite refusal, saying that the King was very sorry that he had not sufficient time. He did not invite Shaikh Hamad to Has Tanura, but His Highness made up his mind that he must go across and see Tbn Saud even without an invitation. Strenuous efforts have been made by the family and everyone to stop him^ for everybody knows that Tbn oaud has a very high regard for Shaikh Hamad and the fact that he nas not invited him for the opening ceremony is obviously due to the lack of facilities either at Dharan or at Has Tanura and to the short time that the King will be there: and, of course, an uninvited descent would be open to all sorts of misconstruction. As a result, the Shaikh is, T understand, sending a second invitation to Bahrain, and it is quite possible that Tbn Saud will now accept, T presume that this is all in order as it would only be a friendly visit and, apart from expense, I see some advantage to Bahrain in a visit from Ibn Saud at this moment. There is bound to be expense any way as His Highness has ordered nev/ cars to send across as a gift to Tbn Saud, — and we shall have to do our best to ensure that he pays for them himself. 2/- - ^ or iourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.T^S., G.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Naturally T discouraged him, for much as I should like to meet Ibn Saud T cannot have Oosaibi arranging things in this way^and there must certainly be no possible loop-hole for the idea that 1 had been cadging an invitation. 3. I can find practically no correspondence in this Agency about Ibn Saud's visit in 1930. The only reference on record - ^ •'o. seems to be Prior's confidential letter No. 18 dated the 5th March 1930, which gives me no information about prior arrange ments or about the action expected of the Political Agent.

The Shaikh, of course, is delighted, and the Family are at any rate relieved that this will prevent him from following out the somewhat undignified plan of going across to Has Tanura even without an invitation. 2. The King has also telegraphed to Abdul Aziz al Qosaibi asking him to inform the Shaikh that he accepted the invitation I jl I on condition that His Highness gave him no presents. Of course J there will be presents, but still it is a very unusual message to send. 3. As far as I can discover the final dates for the Has Tanura ceremony have not yet been fixed, but Ibn Saud will presumably be here sometime in the first week of May, and locally it is expected that he will stay three days.

Ibn Saud* s visit to Kuwait is to be welcomed in so far as it may .improve personal relations between him and Shaikh of Kuwait. But possibility of political discussions taking place raises question of some difficulty. I should be glad of your observations and those of resident by tele graph on the following suggestions: (a) Political Agent should be present in uniform on arrival of King and should attend any important functions in his honour. He should also take any opportunity of extending courtesy to His Majesty e.g. by entertainment at Agency. He should at his discretion impress Shaikh of desirability of avoid ing political discussions except in presence of P Political Agent. (b) Smooth working of any settlement tnat may be reached on blockade queation must depend largely on goodwill of Ibn Saud and if there were discussion K • ^ of this question daring visit a settlement might be facilitated. It might therefore be undesirable to / prevent( / f. i r~. .f hj • 2 m prevent discussions even if it were practicable to do so but Political Agent should be in closest touch with taera if they take place. 2# As regards dates please see telegram to Jed da being repeated to you.

General position with regard to Shaikh of Kuwait's relations with foreign Rulers is somewhat different to that of | Shaikhs of Bahrain and Trucial Coast (including qatar). Latter 4 11 by tlaeir treaties can have no communication with foreign Rulers and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without sanction of His Majesty's Government. There is nothing preventing cOiQ aunicat ions with foreign Rulers in oar agreements with Shaikh of Kuwait (in this connection see correspondence my ending with .leans letter No.388-3 of 27th April 1934). 2. In these circumstances we cannot demur at visit and I agree with paragraph 1 of your telegram under reference. 3, Dickson telegraphs that if he does not receive message from Shaikh that King intends visiting Kuwait he will follow Shaikh to Ibn Baud's camp on 30th January. Dickson is a old personal friend of the King and a private visit therefore ,1 to His Majesty's camp is quite natural. - Resident. : 11rA 11 11 confidential. „ •' r . - fS ■ Political Agency, /'■ v Kuwait.

Visit of H&gt; ? l»King A^dul Aksiz of Saudi Arabia to Kuwait. Sir, Y/ith reference to ray telegram N o .43- a , dated the 7th February 1936, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit here of the Xing of Saudi Arabia. f 2. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz after a show of proper reluctance to impose himself on Kuwait, was persuaded by the Shaikh, who went out to see hira, to enter Kuwait territory as his guest, on the 30th January. 1 1 3» The Political Agent (Colonel h.r .P.Dickson) went out some little way to meet his party as i t came in. This is courtesy in accordance with local ideas, which for some obscure reason or superstition avoids meeting or seeing off visitors at Town gat es. 4. The subject of any private political discussions which may have taken place between the Shaikh and the King are still undivulged. Ho official conversations took place. 5* The King^s visit was generally said to be due to a desire to be near at hand to Shaikh Yusuf Yassin, who is engaged in conversations in Bagdad in connection with the Pnct of Mori- Aggression (Turkey-Persia, Iraq-Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan) and possibly in addition on a aide agreement between Iraq and / Saudi3audi Arabia only; also to return the visit which was owing to the Shaikh of Kuwait who visited Riyadh in 1932, 6. Hurrying couriers passed frequently oetween Kuwait and Bagdad throughout the King's visit, while on the other hand His Majesty and his entourage produced an atmosphere of cordiality and unexpected brightness in Kuwait. 7. His Majesty seemed particularly well although he alleged a severe attack of some internal trouble while travelling. He was in a quite romping and very lavish mood. 8. His presents included an order for several new ford cars from Basra for the Shaikh, Ha. 1500 to the poor of Kuwait and a very handsome uum to Jassim al Yacoub, the Shaikh's Palace Agent and the Shaikh's servants. 9. In return every man of the party which numbered six hundred and seventy five (who travelled in 145 motorsj was given his rt KISWA*&gt; i.e.cloak and complete outfit and thirty rupees. 10. Among the royal party were the j&amp;air Muhammad, son ]5mir Khalid, son l&amp;iir Mans our, son Emir Saud al Arafa, brother-in-law Dr. Fakhri, Shaikh al Ardh Abdur Rahman ash Shuwaish, Chamberlain Ibrahim al Jumaia, Secretary. 11. His Majesty Is romping mood showed itself in much jocularity at the various parties he attended and included the throwing into the sea of two Ikhwan Hollas, who were later suitably rewarded for being victims of this royal horseplay. ■# ■ 12. His Majesty is credited with having married twice during his week's stay, first to Mausa# a daughter of the late Shaikh Mubarak of Kuvait and secondly - information is less certain here - to the daughter offered by an Hafisi, the King's agent / inin Kuwait, a girl whose youth arid beauty is said to amply itiai^e up ior* any iacoX Xinea4&gt;e• 15 # His Majesty accepted invitations from The Political Agent (Colonel Dickson), Shaikh Ali al Khalifa (cousin of Shaikh), Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir (son in law of Shaikh), abdulla an Nafisi (Saudi Arab Agent), Hull a Galih (Shaikh^ Secretary), Hilal al Tfutairi (the rich pearl merchant, ^yhose presents included many jewelled and gilded arms) i I but it is understood, refused, at the Shaikh^s suggestion, two invitations from Sab ah an iJasir, grandson of Shaikh Mubarak, 14. The Political Agent (Captain de Gaury), accompanied by colonel Dickson, Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait Oil Company, visited His Majesty, with whom was the shaikh, on 6th February, and subsequently accompanied the party as it left, some little way on the road. 15. The Shaikh accompanied the King, as a courtesy and in order to hunt with him on and about the frontier. His Majesty expeoted to reach Jarya al Llya on about the 9th February, and the Shaikh to return to JCuwait about the same day. 16. The general impression created by the visit was excellent. The town was en fete and the shopkeepers found it a financial windfall very much to their lining, because this -Vahabi party bought up every bottle of scent in the bazaar, much silk, 40 gramaphones, every record available, tobacco in great quantity, many so maunds of coffee, all ?ord spares, and^much petrol that there /as none left in Kuwait. 17. His Majesty left a Kuwait happier for his coming, / and/Ol \ ; 6 '7 .4- a rd this maO' not have been the least of his objects in view. I have the hono»Jtr to be, Sir, Tour most obedient servant, sd.

A copy of that letter is enclosedt ■mill' together with a copy of the Saudi Government's reply. It will be seen that the Saudi Government do not accept the statement that Bain al Saghir (or Libaina al Saghir, as they prefer to call it) is within the territorial waters of the island of WrmB Ha'san# and claim that the distance jn. between the two is about six thousand seven hundred metres, which is over four miles. 'hey also refer to the placing of a mark on Libaina al Kabir* which# they state# is even farther from Uiwn Na'san than Libaina al Saghir* 2. In conversation# Shaikh Yusuf Y as in supplemented the letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs by the statement that Libaina al Saghir is in a manner part of the Saudi mainland# in that the seas between the two ie so shallow that at low tide pieces of reef are visible here and there# and that# in so far as there is a chaimifl at all between (Iram Ma'san and the Baudi mainland# it is to the east and not to the west of Libaina al Saghir. On the question of the channel# however# he said that he did not wish to give a final opinion.

( i) I have re -measured the distance between this island and Uiam Ha* san, and it would appear that it is somewhat more than 4 miles, i.e. that the Saudi contention is correct in this respect, -s there any way of checking the correctness of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company*s map (i.e. the one referred to in paragraph 3 of your 'Express Letter i5lo # 0/679-1. a/29, dated tne otii November 1938) ? The distance should be taken from low water mark. (ii) If '^ain as Saghir is more than 3 miles from Umm Na'san then the Bahrain claim would presumably have to rest on the erection of tne mark ^ ^t referred to in paragraph 2 of your express letter quoted above. '/hen was this mark placed V 3. Both islands 3a in as Ba ^hir and Bain al tOiabir. Can you check the 3audi statement that the channel runs ISast of these islands and not fest ? 4. Bain al Khabir.

(a) If this line was drawn due North and South midway between 'Budaiya on Manama Island and the Saudi mainland then it appears to me that Bain al Baghir would fall to the Saudis and Bain al Khabir to 'Bahrain. (b) 3ut Bahrain internationally includes all the territory under the Bahrain aovernment in which case the due l^orth and South line should be drawn midway between Tftnm Na*san, which by common consent belongs to Bahrain, and the Saudi mainland. In this case^both islands k would definitely fall to Bahrain. (c^ I imagine, however, that the Baudi line if ever drawn would not be due North and 3outh but would be equi distant from both territories following tne configura tion of the coast line. In this case (1) if the line is equidistant between the Saudi mainland and the Island of Manama bothBain as / f ■ a* krirvX^- **,' f U • .■■-h ' * r,aghir and '^ain al Khabir will fall to yaudi A ^abi a.

They seem to have tried to get the landing work at Ras Tanura, but to have been defeated. It may be that by way of compensating them cheaply Ibn Saud promised in the usual oriental way to recommend them to the British authorities. Nevertheless, it would please and flatter on'ble Lt. Gol. Sir Trenchard Powle, K .G.I.E», G.B.E., / Ibn BushireIbn Saud to know that his recommendation had had some effect. But whether it is either possible or desirable to do anything for the Qusaibis is another matter. Their reputation is, I know, not too good, though the Minister of Finance, who brought me Ibn Saudis message, assured me that they are 'nas umani' 1 . In point of fact I believe that the Minister of Finance hates them, but this is not surprising if, as we believe, he began his career as a coffee boy in their employ.lb Confidential D.C.

WITH reference to the letter from this Office of the 8th May, 1939, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to transmit to you, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Political Agent, Bahrein, dated the 7th May, 1939, on the subject of Ibn Baud's visit. I am, &amp;c. S. F. STEWARD. 3°* ■ Enclosure. Political Agent, Bahrein, to Political Resident, Bushire. (Confidential.) Sir, Bahrein, May 7, 1939. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on the visit of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Sand to Bahrein from the 2nd to the 7th May, 1939. It will be appreciated that this report has been written on the day of the King's departure and that there has been insufficient time to collect much gossip from the palace or the bazaar. The report is therefore based almost solely on my personal observations. 2. On the 1st May, 1939, the Amir Saud arrived in Bahrein from A1 Khobar by launch, and on the same day the Amir Feisal arrived from Cairo by air. The latter had chartered an Imperial Airways aeroplane from Egypt and brought with him Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sheikh Jemal Husseini, who had been summoned by Ibn Saud for a discussion on Palestine. I paid an informal call on the Amirs the same evening, and the following morning they crossed to A1 Khobar by launch, in company with the brothers of his Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein and his eldest son. Sheikh Salman, in order to escort the King to Bahrein. The King arrived in the late afternoon with a huge party of relatives. Ministers, Amirs, political and retainers, and was met on the customs pier by his Highness the Sheikh of Bahrein, Mr. Belgrave, myself and the assistant political agent. The arrival was admirably staged, and an excellent guard of honour provided by the Bahrein police was inspected before Ibn Saud and his Highness entered an open car to drive to the palace in Manama, where the remainder of the A1 Khalifah family and the notables of Bahrein had assembled to greet him. At this point the King performed the first of many acts of cordiality towards myself by insisting on my accompanying him in his car, although I had intended to take leave of him at the pier. After a brief stay at the palace in Manama, the King and his Highness the Sheikh motored to Rafa'a, where a palace recently constructed by his Highness's son, Sheikh Salman, had been placed at Ibn Saud's disposal. 3. On the following morning the Bahrein police gave a short display belore Ibn Saud, followed by Arab dancing; in the afternoon the King, the Amir Saud, the Amir Feisal and several other sons and members of the entourage, together with Sheikh Hamad and the leading members of the A1 Khalifah, came ? a J? ar den-party at the agency. The whole party was in excellent spirits, and ne King cracked several Rabelaisian jokes, while at intervals he made extremely onensive remarks 'about the German Chancellor and Signor Mussolini. He ^mmded me that the ex-Kaiser Wilhelm had in 1914 claimed to be the Sword ana Protector of Islam—and had come to a bad end; and he added, it was [605 z—5]2 interesting to observe, that Signor Mussolini is now using veiy ^uch the same language and will probably go very much the same way! He said that he was L thankful that he had been able to put an end to the Italian connexion with his ' Air Force ' by making the excuse that he felt he ought to send his young men ^ to Egypt for training. i n I d 4. On the following morning I was enabled to pay a tormai call at Rafa'a on His Majesty, who had with him only the Amir Sand and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. The interview lasted half an hour, and I found an opportunity to tell ' the King something about the abortive agitation which occurred m Bahrein last autumn. His Majesty said that he knew well that it had been entirely foreign in origin, and he proceeded to blame Iraq for the trouble it causes in neighbouring States by its press and wireless propaganda. The disturbances in Dubai were also mentioned, and the King made it very clear that his sympathies were entirely with Sheikh Said-bin-Maktum. He then said that he wished to give me some friendly advice : never to believe any news from the coast unless I had verified it myself. He thought that much of our difficulty with the i 1 1 *11 • J 1 _ i 1_ „l l_ ^ J ^-v 4- y-v* /-k -i -n -4- r'x 4-1 y-s -w~t -i- ^ ^— Kf 11 ^ thei 0$ ^ ^ Stated m g ivi 'srefo , liiwme oi itoiupubliclj on retire fffliSaturd X lldU. VCllllC'U. ± XI1J 0\^-L-L . ^ -J TTXVAX UHC coastal sheikhs in the past had been due to inaccurate information from our previous agent there, and he added that he himself had much the same trouble with some of his outlying districts. He wished to assure me that on more than one occasion he had advised Trucial Coast sheikhs to place their trust in the British and to cease making stupid difficulties in regard to air facilities and so on. His Majesty was politely enthusiastic about Bahrein and the admirable relations which exist between the A1 Khalifah and ourselves; and at this point he said that there was one matter which he wished to mention as the friend of all parties concerned. He had intended to raise it with Sir Reader Bullard if the latter had been able to come to Bahrein, but he thought it would be proper to speak to me about it. He had been much criticised for not attempting to make peace between Bahrein and Qatar : it was a stupid and unnecessary quarrel and 5 ought to be ended. In the subsequent pause I remarked that I also was greatly concerned at this quarrel and was constantly on the watch for an opportunity to . initiate a settlement. I thought that both sides were still a little too hot,'but P?' I should be immensely grateful for any advice which His Majesty could, in his a ! wisdom, give me. The King then closed this part of the discussion by saying ' :irm that he hoped to hear before long that a settlement had been reached. I expected the next subject to be Jebel Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, but he then turned to a discussion on oil, making it evident that, in his view, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company did not have his interests at heart. He was thankful that at last some progress had been made by them, but, after all, he needed oil royalties very badly and they were only just beginning to come in in very minor sums. Fortunately, he still had other large areas in his country uncovered by existing concessions, and these would not go for nothing. I might add here that I gathei the impression that the whole Damman visit has been somewhat unsatis factory , the King would not follow the programme which had been arranged; he ai lived at a banquet organised by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and left inside three minutes; he complained to Sheikh Hamad in my hearing that on one occasion he had been compelled to chase food unsuccessfully all around the table with a spoon and fork; and altogether he appears to have reacted somewhat violently to the American passion for schedule. /1 5 -, ' r r 0 reve !' t no Y to the 9 ourse of events in Bahrein. On the afternoon of the 4th May a formal entertainment was given by the Manama and Muharraq unicipahties in the Manama Municipal Garden. The proceedings, once they began were comparatively brief, being confined to short speeches of welcome read on behalf of his Highness the Sheikh and the presidents of the two munici palities and a reply read on behalf of the King by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin The ATr'T 01 ^ 61 '^ 10 a11 r fP® Cts adl nirable, the King's speech referring to this Arab island under its Arab ruler.' Though it would be foolish to imagine that the King had any particular motive, thfs part of the speech was a potent reply to those who talk of British domination and coloXation n Bahrein or the dictatorship of the British Adviser. mosnue irf M^nmin '''Tn 'rij'-lvt ' ' ' &lt; ' a ^ ^e King joined in the prayers at the durmET which Mr TT paid a vlsit to the oil-field and refinery, compSlrf to S' I' 1 '' Hl.

He said that Herr Grobba had told him a gently that Germany and Italy were stronger than the rest of Europe put [ fonj) 1 together, that the democracies were afraid of them, and that he (Ibn Sand) iud V? 31 would be well advised to link his fate with the Axis. He himself, however, had an ^ not the least doubt that, if war broke out in Europe, there would be revolution c 0 PP or tii% • Qermany and Italy, whose people must, he said, be sick of ' £ having their 1U .^ toMues held.' He then went on to deprecate modern tendencies in Iraq, t ii en Hfcaq he said, seemed to be composed of three quite irreconcilable elements : the n ^ H Government, the army and the people. Everyone was in far too much of a hurry, llle disturb _.i j ra qi foreign policy was deplorable.

On Saturday morning the King visited a few of the more important ' j J' Nejdi traders in Manama and also had his eyes tested. (Dr. Kennedy tells me ; ■ that it is merely a matter of giving him slightly stronger lenses.) After dinner ,,, the King attended a torch-light tattoo, in which the Bahrein police, some of the couni} i.J. anc [ a number of school-children took part. It was an admirable ; '' ( ; : production, for which great credit is due to Mr. Belgrave, who was solely . responsible for its organisation. Meanwhile, I had arranged through Sheikn a , 1 Jfi' Hafiz Wahba that the King would give me a private audience after the tattoo, : and 7 , and at this I solicited Sheikh Hafiz's assistance in reading to him two messages - am and a memorandum from His Majesty's Government in regard to Palestine, id There had been insufficient time after the arrival of the telegrams (in very he appfc- corrupt f orm ^ from the Foreign Office to do more than make a rough translation, hedule. but the English and Arabic versions were faired during the night and handed On'r,' to His Majesty when he left Bahrein this morning. As I have reported mama and- separately, Ibn Sand said that he was unable to make any comment immediately, roceeding^ - that he would study these papers in detail on arrival at A1 Khobar and, it eches ofwett ^ w ig} 1 0^ ^o gg nc [ an y message or require further elucidation from His Majesty s , 3 of the t? Government, he would w^rite to me at once. Explaining the presence of Sheik h Yusuf Jemal Husseini, he said that he had received many kindnesses from the Brit is ing's speet- Government, and that, now that they were in difficulties, he wished to do what t would ^ he could to help them. He had sent messages to the Palestine Arab leaders to irt of sf prepare for a settlement, and had asked that Jemal Husseini be sent to him or 1 aI1 d coloD' a discussion, since he regarded him as probably the most intelligent amongs them. It was probably an unusual experience for Ibn Saud to sit with on y two in the p ra ^ ! ; companions in a large and empty palace late at night, and with no more an 3 oil-fi^d aIi; two policemen and two of his own fidawis outside. . „ , hj his car^J iq .

The Manama bazaar is half denuded by the ^ immense purchases made by the Saudi entourage, and a fleet of boats is at present carrying these purchases across to A1 Khobar. I shall report more fully on the ill financial aspect of the visit at a later date. P J® 11. According to information received so far, no political questions affecting Saudi-Bahrein relations were discussed with the sheikh or his family. The King did, it is true, enquire from Mr. Belgrave whether it would be possible to release from jail one of the prisoners convicted of complicity in last October's distur bances, but this enquiry seems to have been prompted by the fact that the man s had at one time been a nakhuda in Ibn Saud s own employment. A roundabout request also reached me to release a Nejdi whom I had imprisoned for rash and negligent driving, but I declined to do anything unless the King himself mentioned the matter. Bazaar rumours heard so far relate mainly to 'the Amir Feisal—one of them referring to his impending elevation to the Throne of Palestine. 12. The effect of this visit has been wholly admirable locally and will I jilittaoar 10 am convinced, have excellent results in a much wider sphere. The King has seen for himself the relations which exist between the A1 Khalifah family the agency and the adviser; he has spoken publicly of his great pleasure in all'that he has seen in Bahrein; he has exhibited equally publicly (and at a time when there are many visitors from other Moslem States in Bahrein) the most marked cordiality towards British officials here; and further proof has been oiven of the personal affection which exists between the King and Sheikh Hamad of a 1 i ei n. I am sure that he has enjoyed his visit, and certainly Sheikh Hamad ms brothers and sons are delighted beyond measure. Indeed, it is difficult to i Kit. ;i A eallse '. aft ^ r the . events of the past few days, that only nine years ago the Political i^Agent m Bahrein reported after Ibn Saud's last visit to the island that 'the iVn a e ^ e + i ? i V ] lslt t 19,8 de P lorable - A more successful impetus to pan-Arab feeling could not have been given and the tenuity of our hold on Bahrein Ti t A Tl rr-X een T re clearl y demonstrated ....

It has now been arranged that the three leading agi tators who are still in prison should be released and sent out of the country for the remaining period of their sentences. The man for whose release Ibn Saud himself requested is to be sent to the Hejaz and the two others are to go to Bombay where they have family connections. 3. Personally this is, I think, quite a good thing. Poli tical prisoners are always rather troublesome and so long as they are kept well away from Bahrain for the period of their sentences there are obvious advantages in releasing them when they can go to some other country. They have all done just about seven months in prison, so that the Bahrain Government's authority has been exhibited with some impressiveness, while the Shaikh will get a certain amount of kudos for making pre mature releases; and at the same time they will be well out of the way.

Xbn baud's extremely friendly attitude towards us as represented by his many public acts of cordiality towards ^eightman - as Political Agent - during his stay in Bahrain was a most striking, and satiafaotory, feature of the visit, and should have - as ifeightman points out - a good effeot not only locally# tout elsewhere# Ibn Saud baa also seen the excellent relations which exist between the ^hal^h, including the Al ivhalifah family» the agency, and the Mviaor, and has spoken publicly of his great pleasure in all that he has seen in that State. Ibn Baud's impression confirms that received by the Amir Baud on his visit about two years ago to Bahrain (see paragraph 4 of my letter Ho. 12*3, dated the 3rd January 1958), and is especially useful at the present time when at tacks are being made in the &amp;rab -Press on the subject of British ^colonisation'* in Bahrain and the 'dictator- •hip ©f the British Advisor.

I am afraid I have delayed my reply to your letter, but I did not wish to discuss this matter with any one in Bahrain until Ibn Saud 1 s visit was over; and also I was waiting for a sloop to come in, in the hope of getting a chart from them. Actually we have not had a sloop in for some time, but so far as I can discover there are no accurate large scale charts of the sea between Bahrain and the Saudi Coast from Oqair to A1 Khobar. 3. From information which I have now received, this appa- rently minor matter of the Bainain 'is likely to become part of a very much more important question. I gather that there is likely to be rapid technical advance in oil exploitation in shoal waters in the near future (made possible by improved geophysical methods of exploration) and the California Company intend to be in the van. The two offsprings in the Gulf, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, are preparing for shoal water exploration to a distance of several miles from the Coast, including areas as far as the Rennie and Bu Athama shoals. 4. I am writing this letter in rather a hurry as I leave for Plasa tomorrow for five days, so I have not had time to look up previous discussions about international rights and how they can be established beyond the three mile limit, but I think it is/- onourable Lieutenant-Colonel ^ir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire . ^ . j e &gt; U6/- is right that you should have this information at once, par ticularly since it has an important bearing on the Bainain question. It is obviously desirable that our views on that question should be so framed that they can do no damage to Bahrain's prospects of sharing fully in any profits which may accrue from developments occurring in the outside shoal waters• 5» Reasonably close in to the Bahrain coast there are convenient exposed humps on the main shoals, e.g.-the Fasht al Jarim, Khor Fasht and Fasht al Jibal, which have been claimed for Bahrain by the erection of marks. With the exception of the Bainain no objection has been raised by any other party and we may presume therefore that no one is likely to dispute Bahrain^ right to grant an oil concession covering these reefs and shoals. Further out however, few, if any, of the shoals show above water at any state of the tide, -- though they may be equally interesting from an oil point of view. Forth and west of Bahrain I do not think we need anticipate that any oil company other than the California Company and its subsidiaries will attempt to work, and consequently com mercial competition will not in this area introduce complica tions. Fortunately also relations between Ibn Saud and Bahrain are excellent, and though Ibn Saud will naturally oe anxious that the Arabian subsidiary should exploit as much of the shoal area as possible (and p ay the royalties to him), it seems to me that the present is an excellent opportunity to mark oxf what one might call 'spheres of influence 1 ' for Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and their concessionaires respectively. I think therefore that there is a great deal to be said for following ^ , L |||||ar ^^ k '■ up the suggestion made by Shaikh Yusuf Yasin for 'drawing » line midway between Bahrain and the mainland' - and then pro- ducing it indefinitely to the north.6, To revert now to the specific question of the Bainain. Bain as Saghir is unquestionably outside the territorial waters of Umm Hasan, I personally have no doubt about the substantial accuracy of the Oil Company 1 s map to which you - refer in paragraph 2(i) of your letter, since their other hydrographic work has been proved to be extremely accurate, and their barge traffic between A1 Khobar and Zellaq depends on this particular map. On the other hand Bain as Saghir is not in the territorial waters of Ibn Saud. The pieces of reef to which Shaikh Yusuf Yasin refers are largely imagi nary (except close to the Saudi coast) and it is just as impossible for the Saudis to take three mile jumps from Coast to reef to Bain as Saghir as it is for Bahrain. It is quite true, as Yusuf Yasin says, that there is a fairly deep water channel between Umm ITasan and Bain as Saghir and this is the normal course followed by country craft going to Cqair. But there is also comparatively deep water on the mainland side of Bain as Saghir which can be seen clearly from the air when one flies over this area, as I have done myself, ihis oeing the case it might well be held that Bahrain, by erecting their If,m - 1 -~- ... - marks on Bain as Saghir (and Bain al Kabir also) in the early spring of 1938 have established their claim by the erection of a 'national' mark on each of them. I find also that in ^ O - u. ~ 65 letter No. 207 of the 4th April 1909 the then r y olibical Agent, Bahrain, mentions that the Shaikh of Bahrain took in those ^ 3lna See to . days a tax from all boats which collected turtle sne^ls on Labainat Al Aliya and Labainat Al Safliya, as the r-ainain were then known. But in view of the possible development in shoal waters to which I have referred above it may suit Bahrain better to compromise over the Bainain in order oo avoid future difficulties to the north. I feel quite certain that/-. /(] -4- l fv l .i.i I i'3 \ /' that the Shaikh himself would, be delighted to do so (in fact I was afraid that Ibn Saud might raise the question when he was here and that the Shaikh would at once abandon his claim to both islets). Personally I would recommend that we should try to get Bain as Saghir for Bahrain and leave Bain al Kabir to Arabia, and then take a line as near due north as vte can get it from the eastern edge of Bain al Kabir. I am afraid I cannot at this moment show my ideas fully on a chart but, if you think that the general idea is worth following up I will send for some copies of Admiralty Chart No. 2837^ and show my suggested line on it. The line would begin well to the south of Bahrain Island. 7. Meanwhile the Bahrain Petroleum Company are anxious to go ahead at once with triangulating the Additional Area, prior to the conclusion of the new Lease. It so happens that they have an expert survey party available very shortly (the party that was on the Saudi Arabia - Iraq boundary survey) and if they can get on to this work at once it will save much time in subsequent geological and geophysical work in the area. The Bahrain Government are perfectly prepared to allow them to do so, and since it is mapping work only I see no reason why we should object to the general plan. It involves only erecting concrete platforms as bases for instruments on certain the islands and reefs where the Bahrain Government marks already exist, together with 'targets' on others. I have made it clear that the party must not on any account land on 3 a in as Sagnir or Bain al ICabir - or even at Hawar for the time being; but otherwise I see no harm in their working on this triangulation inside the area enclosed in the lines marked on the jahrain • —— — «•** /b' Ul * v ^ Government's rough sketch attached to your Express letter fro. if C/331 dated the 7th May 1938. This work in fact might be ***' in .1 „ i i * in ihii » iiiiii — miii «w^^i» ^ extremely useful to us, for inevitably the Bahrain Petroleum Company will ask for a definition of the boundaries of the Unallotted /-Unallotted Area on the eastern side of Bahrain. (On this side, owing to the hostility that exists both between Bahrain and Qatar and between the respective oil concessionaires, there can be little hope of defining 'spheres of influence' such as I have suggested for the other side.) At present there are no accurate charts showing the position of the various islets on the eastern side of Bahrain, to which the Bahrain Government have established a claim by the erection of marks; and since the eastern boundaries must presumably be fixed with strict reference to the limits of territorial ¥/aters an accurate survey such as the Company can do will be of much value. The party would be in a launch and would be accompanied by a Bahrain Government representative, probably 8. I am afraid this letter appears to deal with a number of rather disconnected subjects, but they are all part of a single main subject and I thought it would be better to men tion them all in a single letter. a Police I n T.C.O.

I now enclose a copy of a despatch from jedda from which you will see that the 3audi Government claim that according to their information Bain al Saghir does not lie within the territorial waters of Umm ITa'san and is in a manner part of the Saudi mainland. They also state that Bain al Kahir is so far from Bahrain that Bahrain could not possible have a valid claim to it. 3. The fact that an island lies nearer to one country than to another has in itself no bearing on the question of ownership if there are other factors on which a judgment can 'be 'based; but as there seems to be a direct conflict of opinion on a ruestion of fact; we feel that before we pursue the matter v r ith the Saudi Government, or even make up our minds on the best policy to pursue 5 we should satisfy ourselves as to the e::act positions of these islands. 4.

On receipt of a copy of Jedda despatch Ko.40, dated 2nd March 1939, to the foreign Office, I took up the matter with Political Agent, Bahrain. From investigations undertaken l3y him it can 'be accepted that Lihaina al Saghir is ahout 4 miles from Umm Na'san i.e. outside Bahrain territorial waters. On the otiier hand it is in no sense 'in a manner part of the Saudi mainland (paragraph 2 of Jedda despatch auoted aTx)ve). firstly, the pieces of reef referred to 'by 'BUsuf Yasin exist only close to the Saudi coast. Secondly, while it is auLte correct that there is a fairly deep water channel 'between Umm Na •san and Lihaina al Saglair, and that this is the normal course followed 'by country craft going to Oq.air f there is equally a fairly deep water channel 'between Lihaina al Saghir and the Saudi mainland. ^Further, the Bahrain Government erected their marks on iilDaina al Saghir (as well as on LTbaina al Khahir) in the early Spring of 1938. Finally the Political Agent has fbund a report 'by {Signature) the / {Designation)2. ; / f ( ; vi! „. I M i. .

Lahaniat al Safliya, as the two islands were then known. (I will look up on my tetum to Bushire the papers quoted). 3, political Agent, Bahrain, points out that from the oil aspect the possession of shoals in the vicinity of Bahrain may he extremely important and writes as follows; •from information which I have now received, this apparently minor matter of the Bainain (Libaina al Saghir and Libaina al Khahir) is likely to become part of a very muoh more important question. I gather that there is likely to he rapid technical advance in oil exploitation in shoal waters in the near future (made possible hy improved geophysical methods of exploration) and the California Company intend to he in the van.

My comments on YUsuf Yasin's suggestion are as follows: (a) It this line were drawn due North and South midway 'between Budaiya (the point nearest the Saudi mainland) on Manama Island and the Saudi mainland then it appears to me that LTbaina al Saghir would fall to the Saudis and Lioaina al Klmbir to Bahrain. ('b) But Bahrain internationally includes all the territory under the Bahrain Government in which case the due North and South line should he drawn midway 'between Umm Na^an, which 'by common consent 'belongs to Bahrain, and the Saudi mainland. In this case it appears to me that 'both islands would definitely fall to Bahrain. (c) I imagine, however, that the Saudi line if ever drawn would not he due North and South hut would he equidistant from 'both territories following the configuration of the coast line. In this case (1) if the line is equidistant between the Saudi mainland and the Island of Manama 'both Lihaina al Saghir and lihaina al Khahir would appar ently fall to Saudi Arabia. (2) If the line is equidistant 'between the Saudi mainland and Umm Na'san Lihaina al Saghir would apparently fall to Bahrain and Lihaina al Khahir prohahly to Saudi Axahia. 7./SSifsif 3 Jfcai! ■••'•'JO 7.

In point of fact they are one and the same, and the position of the island is that shown as Bird Island. I send you herewith a revised map which makes this clearer. 3. I went out myself in His Highness 1 launch on Friday last to verify this and had a most interesting cruise in the waters north of Bain al Kabir, eastwards to the Fasht al Jarim and south from there to Khor Fasht. According to observations which I took, naturally in a very amateur manner. Bain al Kabir and Bain as Saghir are almost exactly north and south on a magnetic bearing. The waters north of Bain al Kabir are full of shoals, and it is by no means easy to find channels through them. But, except for the reef running more or less north-west of Bain al Kabir which dries out in patches, these reefs appear to be permanently submerged until one strikes Chachus to the west or Jarim to the east. 4. I am left in no doubt whatsoever that, as I said before, the Bainain are outside the territorial waters both of baudi Arabia and of Bahrain. And I am more than ever convinced that we A Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K#G.I*E., C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. k 'Vwe should ao our best try to run a line more or less north aI ^ S0U 3J^ l:igh these two islands, projecting the line inde- f initely towards the north, in order to divide Saudi and Bahrain spheres' 1 • Unless we do this, whichever country establishes its claim to either of the islands presumably acquires three miles of territorial waters with it, and this would make things very complicated for everyone. , , : 5. I am forwarding to you separately a sketch map which has ^■been prepared by the Bahrain Petroleum Company from Admiralty charts and other information on record, showing Bahrain, the Saudi and Qatar coasts and much of the waters to the norths This sketch map is at present very incomplete and, in some respects (particularly towards the east) it can make no claim to accuracy* I have marked on this sketch map my proposed line between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain which I suggest should form the basis of a discussion for the purpose of dividing interests in submerged lands. Presumably one cannot mark off an inter national boundary, which would be recognised by other Powers, in waters which cannot be claimed as territorial by either party but if the two parties could agree that Bain as Saghir should be regarded as Bahrain property and Bain al Kabir as Saudi, without conferring any rights to territorial waters to the west and east of these islands respectively, and if they could agree between themselves that Bahrain would claim no interests to the west of the north-south line and Saudi Arabia no interests to the east of it, then a workable agreement should be possible. From the practical point of view, other Powers and other interests are unlikely to intervene. 6. A certain amount of speed is I think necessary. 1 gather that the California Arabian Company have already been talking to Ibn Saud about exploration in shoal waters; and that one result has been that Saudi Arabia has been putting up flags on various exposed /-exposed reefs ana small islands off the Hasa Coast more to the north. V/e may find Saudi Arabia making rather extravagant claims in regard to territorial waters, though presumably these would not worry us to any great extent except in so far as they may affect Bahrain interests. Consequently it is most desirable to arrange a 'gentleman's agreement' between Arabia and Bahrain before the Saudis start stretching their Wm arms too wide. Yours sincerely, P.S. Since writing the above I have received a copy of your Express letter No. C/223 dated the 26th May 1939, in which you suggest that the Saudi Govern ment be asked to explain in detail their idea of how the dividing line should run. I am however still submitting my idea about the line and sending a sketch map showing how it goes, since the Saudis will probably claim more than their just share and you may think it desirable that the Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned should be invited to consider in advance the alternative proposals which we shall almost certainly have to make. o hw „ ; 'K fcv 4 \j \ fGOVERNMENT OF INDIA. flnnfidantiai Department.

The King came from A1 Khobar, on the Hassa coast, where he had been inspecting the work of the California Arabia Oil Com pany, in Sheikh Hamed's white and scarlet motor-yacht, a recent gift from the Bah rein Petroleum Company. A fleet of motor-launches, flying the green flag of Saudi Arabia, carried the members of the King's family, his officials, servants, and about 200 retainers. His Majesty was met on the pier by Sheikh Hamed and the Emir Saud, Crown Prince of Arabia, who had arrived ahead, and the Emir Feisal, who came by air from Egypt to join his father in Bahrein. The two rulers embraced each other warmly when they met, standing under a fhuge red umbrella. Huge crowds had assembled at the Manama Palace, where the sheikhs of the^ ruling family were waiting to greet the. King. Lines of household servants dressed in orange, crimson, vermilion, and green robes with gold and silver mounted 5 daggers in their belts, carrying curved 5 swords, lined the space in front of the entrance. In the long audience room,' with a wall of mirrors at one end reflect ing the crowds, the Khalifah sheikhs were assembled wearing their robes of state, richly embroidered silks, hishls threaded with gold, colourful Kashmir head shawls bound with gold agals which in Bahrein are the distinctive , signs of royalty. A^AB DANCES In the mornings the King and his host looked on at the Arab dances seated on chairs on the steps of the palace or some times they motored out to the plain below Sheikh Hamed's country house at Sakhrir,. in the south of the island, and sat in the shade of red and black embroidered tents watching long-haired desert Arabs racing across the plain—now green after the recent rains—on horses from Sheikh Hamed's stables. During his stay the King occupied a new palace recently built by Sheikh Sul- man bin Hamed, the eldest son of Sheikh Hamed, at Rafaa, one of the highest points in the island, where the air is cooler and dryer than in Manama, the capital, 1 which lies down on the coast. Each night one of the senior sheikhs ot the Khalifah family entertained the King at dinner, when 300 or 400 men assembled for the feast, and as many again were fed from the remains of the meal. Before dinner the guests assembled out side the walls, sitting on three sides of a carpet-covered rectangle in long* lines con versing in undertones so that scarcely a murmur was heard. * DINNER ON THE FLOOR When dinner was announced the whole Party rose to their feet and followed the King, who walked hand-in-hand with the Sheikh, through the archway into the open courtyard of the house, like an advancing army, with the guards on its flank carrying rifles and swords. Sometimes dinner was served on long mats with a couple of hundred men squatting down each side, or it was served on a number of circular mats round which 15 or 20 men sat down. Nobody who has not tasted sheep cooked whole, stuffed with savoury rice mixed with almonds and spices, chickens roasted inside the sheep, and hard-boiled eggs in side the chickens, surmounting huge mounds of rice, can know how delicious mutton can really taste. Besides the sheep innumerable stews, pastries filled with meat, dishes of vegetables, fresh fruit, and plates of custard pudding occu pied all the available space on the mat. After eating, the King offered water to his guests which he had brought from his own country—he dislikes drinking any- water except that to which he is accus tomed, and when they had washed their hands in the brass ewers held by servants his Majesty pressed a little scent, essence of frankincense, in the palms of his most favoured guests. The last event during the royal visit was a torchlight tattoo by the State Police and students of the Government schools. Five hundred square lanterns, made of red, green, and white silk, were carried on poles by the performers, who marched and revolved, making geometrical patterns before an audience of many thousands of spectators on the maidan in front of the Manama Fort. The second part of the display was a representation of Arab warfare, in which horses, camels, and men took part; flood-lighting and searchlights were used to illuminate the events, which included an attack on a village by marau ders, who arrived in sailing boats. % JLINDIA OFFICE, LONDON.

You will see that Bain as Saghir is now admitted by Powle to lie outside the territorial waters of Umm Na 1 son The two disputed islands appear on the enclosed chart fs El Ben es Seguira' and 'El Bena Cahera'. This chart appears to have been prepared by the two associated Companies of the Standard Oil Company, and as the Saudi claims are based on information supplied by the California Arabian Standard Oil ^ p * c f0 ' Company (paragraph 4 of 'Jedda despatch No.40 of the 2nd March) we may perhaps take it that both parties to the dispute accept the location of the islands as marked on this chart. Possibly the Admiralty have material which would enable them to check it. The/ L. Baggallay, Esq,, Foreign Office, S.W.I.I The chart does not, however, bear out Yusuf Yasirn's contention taat Bain al Khahir is nearer to the mainland than to Bahrein; ii propinquity is to 'be taken as a criterion 'both islands seem to lie closer to Bahrein territory (including therein the island of Umm Na'san) than to the mainland. The Bahrein claim is moreover strengthened hy the prior assertion of ownership in the setting up of marks ? and there appears (paragraph 8 of Powle ? s letter) to be evidence ox the exercise of sovereignty hy Bahrein in 1909. These facts would appear to^establish a prima facie pre s umption that Bahrein's claims to 'both these islands are superior to those of the Saudis. 3. We should however 'be glad to have your views and those of the Admiralty on Powle's letter generally and in particular on his suggestion that the solution of drawing a line midway 'between Bahrein and the mainland might he pursued.

Your letter to Eyres No, P. Z. 4125/39 dated July 8th, concerning the o\/nership of the disputed islands lying 'between territory of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the mainland of Saudi Arabia. S- Although there appears to he little doubt that the Sheikh of Bahrein has a far better claim to these islands on prescriptive grounds, and that such a claim would take precedence over the Saudi claim on the basis of geographical propinquity, we agree with the Foreign Office that it is highly desirable that Saudi Arabia and Bahrein should reach some such^agreement as that suggested in the Political Agent's express letter of the 29th May, since the / allocation of the islands to either of these claimants would not settle the wider problem of the division of the sea bed between Bahrein and Tiasa for the purposes of winning oil. 3® We fegL, therefore, that it would bo best to take up the suggestion already made by the Saudi Authorities, that the whole area should be divided up between them and Bahrein by an agreed lino. Whether or not we make the first proposal or persuade them to do so is a matter of tactics but the Political Agent's proposed lino appears to us likely to prove satisfactory as a working arrangement if it were acceptable to both sides. 4. The Foreign Office would seem to bo strictly_correct in saying that there is no recognised principle on v/hich such a line should be based, since for the most part? it would traverse the high seas. With regard to Straits less than 6 miles wide however. His Majesty's Government in reply to the League Questionnaire of 1930, expressed the view that when the two shores belonged to different States, the division be tween the two belts of territorial waters would lie 'midway between the two shores'. This phrase was not further defined, but the only common sense interpretation would be that the dividing line should plot the points equidistant from both shores. 5. It accordingly seems desirable to consider the equity of the Political Agent's proposed line as compared with a line ecmidistant from Bahrein and Saudi territory. On the assumption that the Sheikh of Bahrein coula make good his claim to both islands, the Political Agent s line would deprive him of a strip sont32 sea miles wide and 12 miles long in the waters lying between the islands and the mpmlond, on the other hand Saudi Arabia would lose heavily lurtner North since a line equidistant from both otates would turn ••l.Peel, Ssq. ,GBE., MC., sharply/ India Office, S • la • 1 •sharply to the East from roughly tho Northern limit of territorial waters of Bird Island. Bahrein would therefore oo doing reasonably well if the Political Agent's lino oh Gained, hut a line which favoured Saudi Arabia to any consiaorahly greater extent would he inoquitahlo to Bahrein. As a matter of •cactics, therefore, it would soom hotter to ?o ^ 1 hr??n 1 ?h l r^ el p 1 ? r . t,y fWmtins a line more favourable Tim I-Wi +n ° P ° 1:L b i cal Agent s lino or persuading on Saud to^mahe the first proposal. In view of Sheikh asuf YtiSin s approacn wc agree with Eyres that the latter SOGITIG tilG V/ISGP COUrSG. o ThGrG may, hov/evcr, 'be cortain difficulties in dei in in ^ the purposes for v/hieh any lino approximating to the Political Agent s proposed division is adopted. If it could re a i^o naoly be maintained that the islands do not _ujfi-1 the qualification necessary in the British view of 'being ^ Gxfective occupation and use, no serious diif icul uies woulo. arise, and any agreement need merely record that 'both parties were of opinion that the islands were not susceptible of formal annexation and that Saudi Arabia would not grant any concessions covering the sea bod to the Eastward or Bahrein to the Westward of the dividing line. Vaiether in fact the islands are capable of effective use and occupation seems a matter of some doubt since their characteristics and even their exact dimensions are not known* On the 'basis of the knowledge which we possess, we feel capable of saying that no European could effectively occupy either island, but it is possible that an Arab might live there? although food and water would have to be imported. This assertion is based on the assumption that the dimensions of Bird Island are 400 yards by 200 yards and its height 2 foot? and those of Sl-bin-es-Sequira 500 yards by 350 yards with a height of 3 feet. If the islands are smaller than this then strong winds would cause the sea to wash over them on the weather side and spray might render them untenable at certain times. 7» It would probably be reasonable therefore to treat the islands as being incapable of effective occupation and use. It this were not considered desirable or possible then there are the following possibilities^- (1) The line could be drawn so as to leave the territorial waters of each island within the sphere of the State to which it is allotted. (2) The line could be drawn arbitrarily and the two States would have to agree that neither regarded the islands as part of his territory in which case it would theoretically be possible for a third^State to step in and establish a claim to them. This risk would probably be negligible in practice* (3) The line could be drawn allocating each island definitely to one or another of the two parties, each renouncing. 131 favour of the other that part of the territorial waters (and the underlying sea bed) of his island (or islands) which lay within the sphere allotted to the other party* 8* The lccal anomalies created by this last arrangement^ although/'Cfj seem solution uhile Toeing the olovious arrangement from the theoretical peine of view might 'be difficult to negotiate since iu adas so materially to the advantage of establishing a claim to one orboth of the islands. ^ second solution has the advantage of avoiding most of the practical difficulties and leaving a simple dividing line, but it would make it virtual]y impossible for Bahrein to levy any more taxes on the non-Bahreini fishing vessels using either island. 10. You may however decide that this is a consideration of no account# If you do, we would suggest that the second solution appears, subject to the consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein, the host to aim at unless you are prepared to treat the islands as 'being in cap ah le of ^effective occupation and use. 11.

My dear Gi'bson, I enclose a copy of a telegram from Bullard at Jedda regarding the status of three more islands or reefs lying 'between Bahrein and the mainland. This emphasises the desirability of reaching an early / agreement regarding a line to define Bahreini and Saudi / spheres of influence, such as has been suggested in / the correspondence ending with Jarrett's letter to Peel of the 8th November (Mi 07938/39). \ ^/'I f 2. We share Bullard's view that a preliminary discussion 'between Weightman and a representative of Ibn Saud would be useful as a first step, and if you agree, we will authorise Bullard to suggest this to the Saudi Arabian G-overnment. At the same time we would instruct Bullard to inform the Saudi Arabian G-overnment that we were inclined to consider favourably their sugges tion of drawing a line midway between Bahrein and the mainland in order to avoid future disputes, and to enquire how they would propose that this line should run, in order that we might ascertain the views of the Sheikh of Bahrein. 3. A telegram to Bullard on some such lines is relatively urgent. When it has gone we should like to consider further, in the light of Jarrett f s letter, the questions of international law etc. involved in the proposed division of territory. Meanwhile it looks to us as if Fasht al Jarim and Khor—al—Fasht were as Bullard suggests) unquestionably a part of the Bahrein formation and Gezira Chaschus equally a part, geographically speaking, of Saudi Arabia.

'■e are inclined to doubt whether either Ruler would welcome the solution favoured by the Admiralty involving a common renunciation of a claim to sovereignty over the two small islands or would appreciate the reasons for which it is advanced. Of the possibilities mentioned in paragraph 7 of Jarrett's letter one would expect them to prefer either (3) - the Political Agent's suggestion - or (1) to (2). And it is of course not yet clear that the Sheikh, who has in the past claimed sovereignty over both islands, will acquiesce willingly in renouncing his claim to one of them, as contemplated in Weightraan's proposal.

Bain al Kabir, the northern island, is at high springs not more than 50 yards in length and a few «eet in width; spray drives clean across; and local people state that it is quite definitely impossible to live on it. Bain as oaghir, southern island, is roughly 100 yards in length at high spring tides, and being more protected from the shamal is not totally covered by spray.

I agree with the iolitical Agent that the islands in question r i should be regarded as being incapable off effective occupation and use. The acceptance of this view by His Majesty* s Government and the Saudi Government would avoid the difficulties mentioned in paragraph in- 6 of Admiralty letter Ho •M.07938/39, dated the 8th November 1939, to the India Office in adopting the Political Agent's proposed line of division, and would render unnecessary the consideration of the alternative possibilities suggested in paragraph 7 of that letter. sd.

L (Signature) [Designation); « C.A. : &gt; \ • y i rather agree with sir Hugh ±siscoe that', it would be inadvisable to insert the slave clause* uur present treaty with Bahrain insures that anybody applying for manumission to the and proving that he is a slave, shall be manumitted, But because a slave is made a free man, that does not mean that he cannot be tried for his alleged crimes, to apply these principles to the present case. i Subject of Bin baud^ takes refuge in Bahrain, and is accused of (say) theft by Bin Saud' s tfovernment. ihe individual states he is a slave, xhe j^.a . takes evidence on this point, and finds that his statement is either true or false, xf former he is given his certificate, and becomes a free man. if false he is still a free man. ihe uahram uovernment then takes up the charge against him, and if they are satisfied that it is genuine return him to Bin baud, but he is returned not as a slave but as a criminal, ihat is the legal side to it. The practical difficulty lies in the fact that in order to get back escaped slaves, who have committed no crime, Bin Saud*s officials will of course trump up false charges against them, xhese charges the Bahrain uovernment will not be in a position to scrutinise properly, and in any case will be ready to return the fugitive in order to please Bin Saud. There does not seem any hurry about the ireaty from our point of view. As far as jl can see it's one of the few things B.S. wants from us (except financial assistance which he won't get) in return for quite a number of things we want from him. .put up again ^ 0 / c ^y/r A- r / f - , A-.
