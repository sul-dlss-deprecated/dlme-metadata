The inspection will be carried out by the A.I.D. (Aircraft Inspection Department) approved inspection organisation of the firm and the firm*s inspection certificate will be countersigned by the A.I.D. Supervising Inspector. For this service the Ministry propose to charge 2^b on the factory cost of the equipment; this rate is that approved by the Treasury in 1939 for similar stores obtained through the Air Ministry. In your’ letter dated 10th April, 1946, you hinted that 'rt might be necessary to approach the Treasury with a view to the waiving of such a charge. If you still consider such a course desirable I presume that you will refer to the Treasury on this point.O' External ;ment. Ref: 3/3 477«A.Q»0«Q.(Air) » The question concerning the difference in price between the first lot of propellers supplied and those now on order is difficult to reconcile. Do we know whether the price charged by the Air Ministry*- is, in fact, £25 or whether this is the pripe the Afghans are being asked to pay by the Government of India? This point could, no doubt, be confimed by the Air Ministry and the letter which you propose sending to Orvis, with which I agree, should settle the point at issue. If events show the Airscrew Co. are charging excessively I have no doubt the Air Ministry would see to it that they were made to revise their charges.

Sur&gt;ply of Hind Spares. ihe question of supply of spares to Afghanistan for Hind/Kestrel V aircraft was discussed with the Equipment Staffs of Air Headquarters, India and 3.A.H.S.E.a. from whom it was ascertained that a comprehensive search has been made at all Equipment Depots and it is now abundemtly clear that no possiole hope can be entertained of providing any more of these spares from stock in India. ^ensuing discussions it was agreed that any future, demands v/ould be reviewed in the light of satisfying them by resort to local manu facture wherever possible, but little promise was held out that much could oe done m this direction since in the majority of cases the items called for are of a proprietary design or of a complicated nature calling for special manufacturing technique not available within the resources of India. 3. It is apparent, therefore, that future demands will have to be transmitted to II.A., each case being considered on its merits and arrangements made where possible, providing the cost is not prohibitive, for manufacture in this country. + * roia the list of spares detailing the Afghanistan requirements dated 1st July, 1943, the following have been issued or are in the course of issue from maintenance Units and apart from general aircraft stores, such as paints,_dopes and solder etc., represents all that can oe provided, which, as will be seen, will have little effect in alleviating the difficulties of the A.A.F:- Item ' No. Ref.

I have explained to Hogan our difficulties regarding his suggestion that we should place an order direct on the firm for the additional Ik propellers for the Afghans and he has agreed to investigate the proposal that Air Ministry should place the contract, but he was unwilling to make any premises about forcing the issue on this point. I said I would ask you to reply to his letter of 12 th February making reference to my conversation with him and requesting him to enquire into the matter on the lines agreed. You may care to embody something on the following lines in your letter to him:- . .

He agreed with your conclusion that it would lead to an impossible position for either this Department or yourself to place the oraer, ana that we should ask the Air Ministiy to do this themselves / as they are in possession of the necessary specifications from the first order. Failing them, we must try the India Store Department (or the India Supply Mission). Mr. Clearly would, therefore, be very grateful if you would take up the matter with Mr. Hogan as im ucv, suggested.External De;ojafrti/ient. Ref: 3/3477-A.0.C.0.(Air'. . Supply of Hin d Aircraft Prope llers for Afkhanistan . I am not at all happy about the position in which we are likely to find ourselves if we agree to the suggestion put forward by Hogan that we should place an order direct on the firm. I have no machinery at my disposal for the placing of orders and I am of the opinion that we should endeavour to get the Air Ministry to deal with this matter in the same way that all previous demands have been handled, namely, that in the first place Air Headquarters, India should place the demand on M.P.0. India who in turn would refer it to Air Ministry for satisfaction and that Air Ministry should accept responsibility for procuring the items and for despatch to India. Financial settlement could then be arranged under whatever system is in force in India. In the event of the above suggestion not being accept able to the Air Ministry, I think the matter should be referred to the Economic 8- Overseas Department as I under stand they have in certain cases placed orders in this country for supply of equipment required by a user other than the Government of India.

U A* SMn •' ■' ^ Dear -*v ■_ L?ji 4 Aa I mentioned during our telej-hone conversation yesterday, we have been requested by the Goverrsaent of Afghanistan to supply them with certain spares for the Hind/Keatrel V aircraft * with which their Air Force is equipped, and as the Government of India is most anxious to do everything possible to help the Afghans, and so to encourage them to continue using British types of aircraft, we feel we should leave no ©tone unturned in our endeavours to satisfy the Afghan requirement. The Hind, as you know, was declared obsolete aiany years ago and ary spares there were left over in this country have long since been disposed of. For some time now we have been pursuing every avenue in'the hope of trying to find a few bits and pieces but without much success. We heard the other day, quite by accident, that early on in the war you were operating a few Hinds and it was suggested it might be quite possible that there were still some spares stowed' away in your de; ots. I am attaching a list of the spares for which we have been speedily asked and I should be grateful if you would be good enough to ask yourpeople if by any chance there are ary of them in South frica or, even if none of the items appearing in the list are available, if they could give us a list of ary Hind or Kestrel V spares in their possession so that we can pass the information on to the Afghans to see if they are desirous of „ procuring them. iMa Ciury xt //Its Colonel N.

No. 479/43 of the 3rd iky 3. It will be seen that the statement omits mention of List I ( of 194C). That is because supply of items ordered in that list $aa been c npletod. As regards Lists 2, 3 and 4 supply is far fro a cornplete, many items not having been received at all and ot!iors only And there is no thing, to indicate whether trie partially supplied. _ ___ ^ * I miBoin{; Items will eventually be supplied or are not available from any source. The position is further complicated by the fact tlat ““ many cases the quantity of atores actually received falls short the quantity shown in the invoices or consignee’s advice copies m of of stores despatched from India. These invoices when received*are passed to 3/Lar. KING for checking against stores actually received »by the Afghan Government. The discrepancies are believed to be due to the fact that some of the stores consigned are absorbed by the iL\.F. in India ( cf. para. 2 of Hasan’a 3.0. No. 121- F/42 of the 111 th November 1943). But however this may be» thi&gt; state of affairs raakes it impossible for tii.© Legation to say when, if ever, supply against Lists 2, 3 h 4 will be complete. In these circumstances it would seen that finality can only be reached when Air H.i. announce hat supply of everything tliat is available lias been completed and thal unaapplied itertis on the Afghan lists may be assumed no*. :o be available. U^til then this Legation can do no more than subroit, at intervals, statements similar to the one enclosed of stores actually received. But thin procedure has obvious disadvantages. It postpones indefinitely a settlement of accounts with the Afghan Government and leaves them in the air as regards the supply of their spare parts. As it is they are getting restive about the non-supply of some of the stores ordered in the earlier lists and want to place fressh orders which would only complicate an already hopelessly confusei position. This lias therefore been resisted pending a review of the whole position by S/Ldr. KING and the Consandant of the Air Force, but in .Athe meanwhile I would urge that an effort be made to ascertain exactly (what can or cannot be supplied from all sources against the lists Valready submitted and the result comunicatod to me as soon as possibly^riPMSHp x DRj'lPT BXERSSS LETTER Prom: Secretary of State for Foreign /iffairs, India Office, To: H.M.

Of the remainder of the first 300 items we can supply in most cases up to the quantity of each item required. The engine position is worse. The spares here are only likely to be available in odd items where there is interchangeability with other types. (The Kestrelthas been obsolete for a long time). In the circumstances it is questionable whether the items which we could supply to the Afghans would be of very much use to them. You promised to get a decision from Qorbal and we should be very grateful if this could be received here at an early date as we are anxious to clear out all stocks of Hind spares ? which are occupying valuable space.

On learning that Hiiuis were to become obsolete we asked Kabul, on the suggestion of the A.M., to obtain from Afghanistan a list of spares required for the remainder of the life of their Hinds. We told the Government of India at the same time that it would be undesirable to ship any spares from the U.K. except as required. In the meantime we received a preliminary list of immediate requirements (Ext. 1732A-3)which India could not supply, and which A.H.Q. India had referred to the Middle East, South Africa and the U.K. I understand that the A.M. are now working on this list and hope to ship some of the spares shortly. They have undertaken to keep us informed. What puzzles me is that Kabul Express Letter now received does not refer to the list on which the A.M. are working, and so without a laborious checking of items against each list I cannot say whether they have been included in this latest list. I am quite prepared to check but it seems to me a waste of time since we do not know how much of the comprehensive list India or the a.A.P. elsewhere intend to supply. The question of cost is also rather iuq)ortant, for I think that we must have some idea of the approximate cost before we let the A.M. ship spares haphazardly. I consider that before we can really go any further we should either (a) telegraph the Government of India asking how much A.H.Q. India intend to supply from the final list, and how far it is based on the earlier list received with Ext. 1 ^ 08 / 4 . 3 &gt; also whether they wish us to ask the A.M. here how much they can supply from the U.K. and to get an estimate; or alternatively (b) to pass the 'comprehensive list on to the A.M. and let them have the headache working it out ’with A.H.Q. India. I do not think that we need be too closely concerned with the details although we should watch the financial side and keep the A.M. up to scratch. (incioentaly to complicate matters further, we do not appear to have received lists 1 and 2 referred to in paragraph 3 of Kabul letter below). -X I V\ Draft letter Wing Commander S.R.K.Glanville, Seaford House, 37, Belgrave Square, S.W.lo Q m) - |l 'i tt)G Will you please refer to Wing Commander laywtrbs. letter to Rumbold of 8th February, Copy to Ka^ul/' IncgX '^9 03 ForeignXi^igg^P^.

On learning that Hind aircraft were to be declared obsolete to the R.A.F. ; we undertook to obtain a sensible estimate of the Afghan Governments requirements now and in the future, based on the estimated life of their aircraft. 2. I now enclose a copy of an express letter received from Kabul forwarding a comprehensive list of requirements based on a four years period, divided into immediate v/ants and long term wants. The Air Ministxy are already in possession of a preliminary list of immediate requirements (see Rumbold*s letter to Whittuck Section S.9 dated 10th April, No. Ext.1732/43). I shall be glad if you will be good enough to /examine2. examine the two lists and let us know how much of the items the Air Ministry will he to clear the R. A. F.Depots of stores forthwith, we shall have to consider in the light of your reply whether it will he advisable to store them here and draw on them as required, or to endeavour to ship them to India for storage* 3. We should also like to have a rough estimate of the cost if possible. If it is likely to be heavy, we may find that it will be in the best interests for the Government of India to take over what is available and re sell the spares to the Afghan Government as they need them, 4. I should add that the lists referred to i in paragraph 3 (i) and (ia.) of Kabul letter enclosed, have not been received here, A copy of the list referred to in paragraph3(d=L) (which date should, we think, read 28th /November in a position to supply.3 IcURMacL November 1942) was dfavt ; to the Mink %l»*r&gt;lteCAb *32 4h his ^letter to Be^ae of 20 th February, No. Ext.720/43.

The goods were insured by ourselves, and it was our recovery against the insurance which enabled us to credit the Afghan Government with the £217.16. Od. We trust that this settles your queries in connection with the goods, and we shall be glad if you will confirm that you are arranging to telegraph our Mr. Bradley immediately. We are.

The position is a little complicated and perhaps the attached note may help to clarify it for you. Kith regard to spare parts, the Air Ministry mil shortly be supplying a large quantity of Hind spares, details of which were sent direct to them in microgram foxm by A.H. 2» India. We have not had copies here, but we understand' them to be identical with the lists sent to us by the Government of India in March last (reference Ext.173?/43) • These lists are said to be an estimate of Afghan requirements over an arbitrary period of 24 months. 2. In the meantime we are awaiting a further list of the Afghan Government’s requirements based on the fact that Hinds are now obsolete and that the Afghans will need to obtain enough spares (so far as they are available) to last the lifetime of their Hinds. Sir 'rancis Wylie has said that the Afghan y Government are drawing up such a list and that it will shorty be ready. 3. Katodon 194 below deals, however, with yet a further list of spares for which the Afghan Government have asked the Americans (reference Ext. 1319/43) • Sir Francis Wylie told Mr. Engert at the time -that it would be better to let India supply them where possible until the shipping question was less acute, and suggested that our list (presumably the one which the Government of India were drawing up) and the Americans’ list might be checked against each other when ours was available. The American items do not figure in the lists which have been sent home, with the exception of fabric. (item 4 ) which is on the short list already supplied by the Government of India (List A, Ext. 1733/43) • Sir Francis Wylie applies, however, that items 4 ? 3 and 6 are being supplied byTndia. 4. 1 see no reason why the Americans should not supply the remaining items, and in view of the Afghans’ desperate need of spares,Priority A seems desirable.

Dear Miss Rolfe, r :* t vn vv ih ^ \ jjr*t**A - With, reference to our telephone cronversation regarding Kabul telegram No. 134 of the 26th May. Seven of the items listed at Annexe 2 to the Allocation Memorandum No. 426/42 of* the 28th November, were already included in the list sent by India (which included Afghanistan's requirements) in larger quantities than those shown in Annexe 2. Of the remainder, instructions have been given to add four items to the list in the quantities shown at Annexe 2. We do not quite understand what is meant by the other item 'Cables and Pools complete' (presumably 'Spools' is intended), but we are informed that there should be no difficulty in obtaining any cable items from India. ^ rVi 1 &lt;^v rA 2. It is understood that you have already taken action with Messrs. Hav/ker on the last paragraph of the Minister’s telegram. 3. As arranged, I will endeavour to find out when the spares on List ’B’ are likely to be despatched, and will let you know. Yours \ Miss D.H.

(initld) h.a.f.r(umbold) Will you please see Mr. Caroe's -reply to 16r» Peel*s letter asking for a statement of the surplus profits of £10,000 which the Government of India received on the sale of 20 second-hand Hind aircraft to the Afghan Government in 1939* A statement of receipts and expenditure is appended to the letter (incidentally the calculations do not appear to allow for accumulation of interest, so presunably the sum has not been invested.) The Government of India estimate that about £6,000 should be in hand at the end of the current year and consider that this sum might properly be used for financing the cost of the Hind spare parts which we hope to get from the R.A.F. for sale to the Afghans. (dee telegram dated 20.2.43* flagged on file No. (2) attached). The position with 55 - regard to the spares is that we are waiting to hear from the Air Ministry as to what spares they are able to supply. Recent ly in a telephone conversation with an official of the A.M. I was informed (en passant) that a large consignment of spare parts were being shipped shortly. I reminded him that this was the information for which we were waiting and asked that we might be given official particulars of the consignment as soon as possible. This he undertook to arrange. We might delay comment on the Government of India*s letter until we have received some estimate of the cost of r Xes spares which the A.M. are supplying. Should a copy of this (initld. ) correspondence now go to the Foreign Office? H.A.F.R(UMBOLD) (signed) c.i. rolfe. 1.7.43. My understanding of the position is that the spares which the A.M. are supplying now do not affect this question, because they have been definitely ordered by the Afghan Government who would presumably pay cash for them. There is however the further question of the earmarkingJr*** ■ 2. of enough Hind spares to keep the Afghan Governments Hinds going for say 5 years# If the Afghan Government do not wish or are unable to buy for cash all that they will require in this connection, we may have to finance them# , There are indications that they have given a list to the ' *- legation at Kabul, but it has not yet reached us# ' (SIWED) H.

London, S1. ^ May 1943. 0-4-&lt;W You will recollect that vfo have held a certain amount of correspondence with the .dr Ministry recently regarding the supply of spare parts for the Hind aircraft which we sold to the Afghan G-oVermont in 1937 and 1939 and of which 26 are still serviceable or repairable. The position regarding these spares is that a provisional list of Afghan requirements for an arbitrary period of 24 months, apart from those which India can provide, is under examination at the Air Ministry and we acre awaiting a further list drawn up on the basis of what is necessary to keep the Afghans 1 Hinds in repair for the rest of their estimated life. *A m c opy of a telegram from Sir Francis Wylie stating that N0.114 dated 13th May ) the Afghan Government wish to purchase another nine Hinds from us, together with certain equipment. The reasons why the nfghans want Hinds instead, oi less obsolete aircraft are probably that the smalx .Afghan idr Force i% maintained primarily for internal security purposes for which they are adequate, their pilots are accustomed to ahem, 'tLey realise that we could not release arty machines of an up-to-date type, and Hinds would be a cheaper proposition than anything more modern, which naturally is a great consideration with a small and noor country such as Afghanistan. 3. Subject to the views of the Government of India, which we may expect to get, v/e shoiddr-^ery mhch. like.do^bo able to give the Afghans as helpful a reply as possible to their present request*. We have a. clear field to develop our influence with their Air Force since the Italian instructors and personnel left Afghanistan with the Axis nationals in 1941, and the Afghan Government arc unimpressed by the performance of their Italian aircraft which they now propose gradually to scrap and /replace Wing Commander S.R.K. Glanville, Seaford House, 37, Belgrave Square, S.W.l,r v r 2. re-olace with Hinds. The political aspects of the matter care^ deveioped in^Poel's letter to Sir Francis ^ylie No .Ext. 1204/^-3 of 20th ^pnl 1943 of which e. copy went to the ixir Ministry on the same da.y. 4. We realise that it may not he desirable for the ilfghan Government to buy Hinds, even if they are available in suitable condition, on account of the difficulty of finding enough spares with which to keep^v them, as well as their existing 26 Hinds, serviced for five years under hfghan conditions, and it would be definitely undesirable to supply aircraft which are not in good condition or for which we could not supply spares on that scale. If in distributing your stock of Hind spares you have not enough to meet all demands, requirements for the maintenance of the Afghans’ existing Hinds should have priority over the provision to them of additional Hinds. 5. We should be glad to have your views, and we should welcome any alternative suggestion you may be able to offer in the event of the supply of Hind aircraft being difficult. At this stage we should require only an approximate estimate of the relative prices of any aircraft which could suitably be sold to the Afghan Government. 6. A verv important consideration is that it would be extremely difficult to ship aircraft for the Afghans from the United King^ om. For this reason we hope that you can select old type aircraft whic are either already in India or the Middle East or which coirnd be flown to India. 7.

There is of course the military value, in the eventuality of the Afghans becoming at any time our Allies, of the Afghan Air Three being equipped so far as possible on the same lines as the R. A.F*, and the political value to our relations with the Afghan Government of assistance in this sphere* It is indeed the main sphere in which the Afghan Government have so far accepted our help, and to some extent they are likely to judge our ability and willingness to help them in other matters by what we do in this one* There is the further consideration that these contacts may encourage members .of the Afghan /dr Force to entertain friendly feelings towards the R*A*F. in particular and hence to Great Britain in general. If Afghan youths are like those of other countries, we are likely to find that it is the more energetic and ambitious among them who go in for flying, and consequently the chances of some of the members of the Afghan Air Force becoming, by reason of their personal qualities, influential at Kabul when they are ten or fifteen years older, may be good. It is, therefore, worth v/hile for us to take trouble with them. 3. T he question of Hind spares seems to be the main question of the moment and separate correspondence is proceeding on this point (your letter to Caroe No.463/43 of 23rd February and our letter to Curtis Ext.1537/43 of 1st April). We hope that the R.A.F. in India will be able to supply enough from their stocks to keep the Hinds serviced for the time being until the more general question of final allocation to Afghanistan out of the Hind spares now becoming surplus can be settled. Sir Francis Wylie, K.C.S.I. ,C.I.E., British Legation, Kabul.h if. there are any other ways in which you think that -J.-e can inprove on whet we are doing durxng our presen opportunity to impress our influence on thejfghon ^Jorc whether by the provision of'personnel or otherwise,^ recoraaendations which you natas will be sympataetica considered. But as you Know supply insider at ions e^, impossible the provision of new equipment, and the despot of^any bulky material from the United Kingdom is precluded by shipping difficulties. 5, We see that Wigginton has settled in md we should be interested to hear how he is shaping. We hope that he is learning Persian and developing personal contacts wxth the Afo-han pilots. I do not know whether he is to remain at Kabul after his first year is up in nugust, but it seems desira e that an a rule our Pilot-Instructor should spend at least a years there. Baxter. 6.

They report that unless spares can be obtained from India within the next three months all the Hind aircraft in the Afghan Air Force will become unsafe to fly. The fabric of most of the aircraft is now 6 years old and requires replace ment, No spare propellers are available and several of those in use have cracks in the propeller boss and may become unserviceable in the near future. In the event of a call being made on the Afghan air Force for operations involving the maintenance of the internal security of the country, the British instructors are of the opinion that it will be extremely difficult to make more than 8 Hind aircraft available for operations.'1 I 0^ &gt; 'vf 3 . - w *r ’• ^ .

Mr. Robinson, the mechanic supplied by Messrs. Rolls Royce, has been dispatched to Bombay by the Commandant of the Air Force to purchase certain workshop material and spares. Rs.10,000 Indian have been placed at his disposal with the Afghan Consul at Bombay. In the autumn of last year an Afghan officer was dispatched for this purpose but apparently returned without having been able to secure their full requirements. Ext.8190/41 Report dated 1st May to 51st July 1941 The supply of spares for Hind aircraft is now an urgent matter due to the accidents in (Dj above. The spares purchased by Mr.Robinson in India (see report for the quarter ending the 30th April, 1941) have arrived at Peshawar and are awaiting collection by Afghan transport.

Workshop material and spares purchased by Mr. Robinson in India in April 1941 were still lying at Peshawar at the end of October. The Air Commandant complained that the non arrival of the spares was due to the non issue of export licences by the Government of India, but enquiries have been made, and it would appear uhat the fault may lie with the Afghans themselves in failing to produce transport to convey the material from Peshawar to Kabul.

The spares and workshop material purchased by Mr.Robinson, Messrs.Rolls Royce’s engineer, in India in April 1941, are now on their way to Kabul from Peshawar. The delay in delivery has been due to misunderstandings regarding licences for the export of the material from India, and the failure of the Afghan authorities to provide motor transport. Ext. 4225/42 Report dated 1st February to 50th April 1942 Some spares are still urgently required.

As a result of an enquiry from the Afghan Government in July last for quotations of the price of certain spare parts of Hind aircraft,obtainable in India, Sir Francis Wylie raised the question of spares with the Government of India in his memo, dated 28th November, 1942, (Ext, 7167/42) #&lt; in anticipation that the Afghan Government would sooner or later have to ask for the supply of these spares if they wanted to prolong the lives of the machines to the limit, and fearful that the spares might not then be obtainable, he has suggested that it would be wise to look to the future and to earmark against an indefinite future demand, all suitable spares available not only in India but in the United Kingdom and elsewhere with the R.A,F, We thereupon wrote to the Air Ministry on 5th January to make tentative enquiries and it seems that Sir F. Wylie's forethought is most opportune. From the reply below it v/ill be seen that the Air Ministry are about to declare Hinds obsolete machines to the R.A.F. and to get rid of all spares. The history of the Hind aircraft in Afghanistan is briefly as follows. The Afghan Government bought 28 Hind aircraft from us between 1937 and 1939• Eight new ones were bought from Hawkers in 1937 by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India and resold immediately to the Afghan Government who paid for them in seven instalments. The last payment was made in September, 1942, At the same time the Afghan Government accepted a stipulation that they would employ four British instructors with the Afghan Air Force, one of whom would be a pilot instructor and the other three aero mechanics. In addition 20 secondhand Hind aircraft were sold by the Air Ministry to the Government of India in 1939,who in return resold them to the Afghans with immediate delivery and deferred payment in three instalments which were completed in 1941* C In the latest reportj(on the Afghan Air Force it was started that 23 of the aircraft were serviceable - three were unserviceable but repairable and only two had been written off as unrepairable. This is pretty good and is perhaps due to the skill of our British mechanics there. Because we sold these planes to the Afghans and because of the influence which we thus have in the field of flying in Afghanistan we should do all that we can to keep the aircraft going, more especially as even were the Afghans to have the available cash, replacements during wantime would be out of the question. Even the spares are not likely to be cheap. It will be seen that the estimate for the preliminary listdf^r immediate requirements from India amounts to over .£4,000 (see Ext. 7167/42) and the question is are the Afghans likely to have the money or to -want to spend it^in order to store spares against possible future requirements. The Government of India would perhaps consider financing the spares out of the Afghan Fund and selling to the Afghans as and vixen they require them. This would mean storage space and responsibility for their safety either here or in India. It would be as well to obtain the Government of India and Sir Francis Wylie's views before we put any propositions for payment and a draft telegram is accordingly submitted for approval. There is no time for long delays as it appears that the Air Ministry are unlikely to be patient since they require their depot space urgently.

Reference correspondence ending vath memorandum no.4278-F/42 dated 22nd September, 1942 j from tne Government of India in tSe^xternal Affairs Department. 2. The Afghan Government have not yet asked for the supply of any of the spare parts in question but it is understood from the British \Vpilot Instructor with the Afghan Air Force that they are vital for the continued functioning of the Kawker Hind aircraft supplied, sane of them second-hand, from British sources. It is thus of extreme political importance that, when the request for spare parts comes from |the Afghan Government, supply should be made. 3. This request is inevitable but it cannot be said how soon it will, come, and in the meanvvnile there is perhaps some danger that spare parts suitable for these obsolete aircraft and still available in India may be converted into scrap or used for other purposes. It is with this apprenension in mind that His Majesty’s Minister suggests that all the spare parts shown in enclosure I to tnis memorandum, or as many of them as are available in India, should now be earmarked for supply 1 on payment to the Afghan Government as and when they ask for chom. enclosure I is a copy of the list forwarded with this Legation memo randum no. 426/42 aated 11th July, 194^ ; and returned, priced, with tne External ATfairs Department memorandum mentioned in paragraph 1 above. 4. if there is any practical difficulty in identifying any of the parts shown in enclosure I witn a view to earmarking them as suggested above, it would be possible to arrange, on hearing from the Government of India tnat this was desired, for the engineer of Hawker Aircraft Limited now employed by the Afghan Air Force to proceed to India for the purpose of this identification. 5. In addition to the spare parts shown in enclosure I, the British Pilot Instructor with the Afghan Air Force has informed this Legation that the spare parts shown in enclosure II to this memorandum are also essential for tnese aircraft. It is requested that these spare parts may also kindly be earmarked against a request for them from the Afghan Government in due course. \ 6. If the Afghan Government can obtain the spare parts shown in these ({two enclosures the continued functioning of their obsolete British [aircraft will, it is understood, be possible for some time to come. jlBut, with the lapss of time, there will be further need of spare parts. ( The Afghan Government cannot afford to be contimialiy changing over to unewer types of aircraft and they will always want to prolong the lives [of their machines to tne limit. It teems therefore to His Majesty’s I Minister that it is important now to look well ahead and to consider how spare parts are to be provided in future years. One course which suggests itself is to earmark for the Afghan Government against an j indefinite future demand, in addition to the more immediate demand shown in the enclosed lists, all suitable spare parts now available not only in India but also in England and with the Royal Air Force elsewhere if they are not required for immediate war purposes and if • they are otherwise liable to become unobtainable in future years. His Majesty’s Minister will be grateful if the Government of India will kindly give this issue their consideration. ( F.

A great deal of correspondence in the file is dedicated to a search for supplies amongst British and Indian stores; supplies for obsolete aircraft such as the Hind were in short supply in the 1940s. Periodic lists of supplies required by the Afghan Air Force have been filed within, along with supplementary correspondence related to financing and shipping purchases to Kabul. Arrangements for the manufacture of new propellers in the United Kingdom (UK) for Afghanistan's Hind aircraft are also documented in the file.The main correspondents are British officials within the following departments: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, the India Store Department, the British Legation at Kabul, and the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Counsellor, British Legation, Kabul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Store Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hawker Hind (Bomber)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000224#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
