The letters state that the representative was principally concerned about discrimination against Pakistan currency, and also proposed to recommend the opening of a branch of the bank in Bahrain. The file includes copies of correspondence dated 1944 showing that the Ruler of Bahrain (Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah [Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah]) had agreed at that time not to permit the opening of any additional bank in Bahrain for a period of ten years.The file includes a divider, and a list (folio 2) of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>State Bank of Pakistan</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Banks</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000219#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000219#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
