Hennell refers to a note that he received from the Prince, in which the Prince stated that, having been informed that the British Government had ordered all Dutch subjects to pay the same custom duties as British traders, he made arrangements to collect these dues. Hennell states that he replied to the Prince and informed him that no such order could have come from the British Government, as the Kingdom of the Netherlands is an independent state. Hennell writes that he did consider asking the Prince to make those Bushire merchants who trade with Java exempt from inland and transit duties, after their having paid five per cent on Dutch produce. However, Hennell goes on to state that he is hesitant to take this action as it would mean intefering on behalf of individuals who are not under British protection. Hennell states that he will await Sheil's instructions before taking further steps. Two enclosures follow on from this letter: a translated extract of the aforementioned autograph note, dated 16 January 1850, from His Royal Highness Bahram Mirza, Prince of Fars, to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf; and a translation of Hennell's reply, dated 7 February 1850.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00000c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
