Copy of a letter from the Deputy Under Secretary of State, Coloniar Offic e to the Director o f Military Intelligence, War Office, dated 17th Jan u ary, 1940. xxx The question of the supply of arms and equipment to the Government of the Yemen has again come up for consideration as a result of a further enquiry recently made by the Imam, You may remember that the question was considered at the 68th Meeting of the Middle East Sub committee on the 19th of June last and that, as a result, we sent a telegram to the Governor of Aden on the 2nd August, a copy of which was sent to the War Office on the same day. No request for the supply of civilian duty respirators or equipment was received from the Yemen as a result of our telegram. In fact, little more v/as heard of the matter until we received from the Governor of Aden on the 5th January a report that the King was again enquiring about the supply of arms. A copy of this telegram was sent to Major Mallaby on the 11th January with a suggestion that it might be an advantage to refer the question to the Middle East Committee again. For convenience T ^ further copy.As a result of discussion 'by telephone with the 7ar Office (Captain Simpson), we gathered that the prospect of arms or equipment being made available to the Yemen at any early date was still more unfavourable than when the question was last raised. In the light of this information there seemed no object in summoning a further meeting of tho Committee. We are, none the less, faced with a somewhat difficult problem. There is no doubt that, on political grounds, it would be a considerable advantage to us to be able to agree in principle that His Majesty’s Government will supply some munitions to the Yemen, even though the amount may be small. There is considerable friction on the frontier at present as a result of the Yemeni claim to Shabwa and j; 1 Abr. and we hope shortly to send a negotiator to Sana’a who will endeavour to reach a settlement of the whole question of the southern frontier of the Yemen - that is to say the frontier with the .-iden Protectorate. There can be little doubt that an offer to help the King over the supply of munitions would ease _-mglo-Yemeni relations and help to create a better atmosphere for the negotiations. What we should like to say, in reply to the Governor’s telegram is that His Majesty’s Government agree Ir principle to the supply of some arms and equipment to the Yemen on repayment and would be glad to learn what equipment and stores the Yemeni Government desire to purchase; that the King must understand that the demand for muni tiers equipment for the British forces and their Allies throughout the world is extremely heavy at the present time and consequently that no promise can be made that any particular requests could be irK:'' r immediately; but that if the King will state his requirements, it may be possible to inform him at whatdate the supplies could he sent. We would propose to add that any arrangements for storage at Aden would have to he at the expense of the Yemeni Government. I should he very grateful if you could let me know whether the Yar Office would he prepared to concur in a reply on these lines. I understand that the Foreign Office are in correspondence with you regarding a similar request which has been received for the supply of arms to Ihn Baud, and that, in their view, at least as favourable treatment should he accorded to Ihn Baud in this matter as to the King of the Yemen. (Sgd. ) J.1S. SHUCKBURGH. -5-II Ccpy of a letter from the Director of Military I ntel lig ence, / ar Office, to the Denuty Under secretary of b tate, Col onial Office, da ted 22nd January, 1940. /5 .0,/557/M.Io 2.7 X X X X In your letter of 17th January, 1940, you ask whether the vVar Office would be prepared to concur with the Coj^ nial Office desire to agree in principal to supply the King of the Yemen with war material. The political advantages of concluding such an agreement are fully appreciated, more cordial relations than have hitherto existed being most desirable with the Yemen in view of the approaching work of boundary demarcation, including the vexed problems of Bhabwa and A1 Abr. It is felt, however, that even agreement in principle could but lead to reiterated approaches on the part of the King of the Yemen for the supply of war material which we are quite unable to meet in view of priority demands. Even if reservations as to date, or probable date of supply, formed part of such an agreement as would be essential, it is felt that the inevitable waiting would in the o:jd lead to vexatious interchanges which would culminate in our relations with the Imam beiig woras than hitherto There can be no doubt that Ibn Saud, on hearing of any agreement as to war material between H.M.G. and the Yemen, wo^'M ■nreso Ms demands to a degree which0 /i * might endanger the excellent relations now existing between him and ourselves. That this latter inference is no chimera is apparent from the general contents of Jedda telegrams 15 and 16 of 18/1/1940? and of paragraphs 5 and 6 of those telegrams in particular. While it is admitted that these telegrams have arisen primarily over the Question of Dr. Grobba f s proposed visit to Jedda, the reference in paragraph 6 to ,f this is a very difficult moment for Saudi Arabia and a most favourable moment for H.M.G. to show their generosity” is significant of possible rising exasperation on the part of Ibn Saud. As a mark of H.M.G’s generosity, Ibn Saud would little appreciate the conclusion of an agreement with the King of the Yemen for the supply of war material, when we have long outstanding demands for arms from Ibn Saud with which we cannot yet comply. Moreover, it would appear to be of far greater importance to us to retain Ibn Saud's goodwill than to risk losing it in favour of a possible better understanding with the Imam whose attitude hitherto has been most uncordial and who is of decidedly lesser influence and importance in the Arab world than Ibn Saud. In view of the above I fear that the War Office would not be prepared to concur with even an 'agreement in principle' between H.M.G. and the King of the Yemen for the supply of war material. I am spaing a copy of this letter to the Foreigr Office. Yours etc. (Sgd.) F. BEAUMONT-NESBITT. -5-CD ^THIS DOCUHENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT). SECRET . (0)( 40)6.

(Signed) W. PORTER. Richmond Terrace, S.W.l* 8 th August, 1939*CYPHER telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to rhe Officer Administering the Government of Aden 0 (Sent 11»0 p.rrio , 2nd August, 1939) No. 151 Secret, Your secret telegram of 14th June and my telegram No. 127 of 21st June, Supply to Yemen of anti-aircraft guns and respirators. You should now reply to King of Yemen on following lincse Begins® His Majesty’s Government would not wish that the Yemeni forces should he supplied with anything except the best class material i such as is used by British forces® His Majesty’s Government much regret that so far as anti-aircraft guns are concerned pressing needs of their own re-armament programme make it impossible to supply guns from their own stocks. The King of the Yemen will appreciate that the factories in Great Britain will be fully occupied for many months to come with orders for anti aircraft guns for defence in the United Kingdom and British territories overseas. In the circumstances they suggest that Yemeni Government should approach reliable foreign suppliers and they suggest that Messrs. Bofors of Sweden mi$it be able to meet their needs in reasonable time. In order to assist the King in considering this suggestion following particulars of anti-aircraft guns have been obtained from Bofors’ agent in London without disclosing for whom enquiry was made. Prices are onlyQ&gt; approximate. 40 mm. A.A. equipment for defence against low-flying attack, £3,600: 40 mmo sight. (essential), £650: 40 mm. spare barrel. (one required for each equipment), £160: Spare parts and stores, per set, for each equipment, £420. 75 mm. A.A./Field equipment, £7,000 to £6,250 according to the number of guns ordered: this price includes tools, spare parts and accessories, and course and speed sight. Height finders would also be required in proportion of one to each two or four 75 mm. equipments. Price cannot be quoted till definite enquiry made. There is also available a 25 mm. A.A. gun for defence against low-flying attack, price approximately £1,600* It is suggested that Yemeni Government should get into direct touch with agent in London of Messrs. Bofors, Captain Harvey Combe, Bush House, Aldwych. If order placed with Messrs. Bofors War Office would be prepared to arrange in due course inspection of materials before its despatch to Yemen on understanding that Yemeni Government will pay expenses involved. As regards instructors His Majesty’s Government would suggest that of three sources mentioned by King Turks are most likely to be able to provide efficient personnel. His Majesty's Government regret that owing to pressing demands for their own forces they are unable to supply general service respirators which is type normally used by troops. They are able, however, to supply at short notice 10,000 civilian duty respirators at cost of 7/6d. per respirator. These, while not so suitable as general respirators for troops in battle, would be -2-suitable for use by troops for garrison duti.esc Civilian duty respirators are supplied to the members of the voluntary services in England who will be required to be on duty in the streets during air raids, and afford a high degree of protection. Respirators are made in two sizes, normal and small. In addition there would be cost of freight, etc, 20,000 tins of Bleach ointment, each tin of two ounce capacity costing £2*7,0 per gross can also be supplied in from three to four months if order is placed at once. Yemeni Government will no doubt state as soon as possible whether they wish to purchase this material with numbers and sizes required in order that arrangements may be made. In order to facilitate financial settlement it is suggested that Yemeni Government should pay to Aden Government a round sum approximating to the cost of equipment which they order as soon as it is ready for delivery. Ends. Under Treasury rules payment should be made in advance and I suggest that position can be met by arranging with the Yemeni Government to deposit with you approximate cost of material they desire. You will no doubt arrange with Hewitt's assistance to convey to King information as to best method of storing and maintaining respirators and equipment of this type in hot climate. It may also be possible to offer a supply of light protective clothing suitable for tropical climate. If so I will telegraph details shortly.^ * * ■ 4* t/*sse0* tf'S'.

THE SUB-COLIHITTEE had under consideration a telegram from the Governor of Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies regarding the fortification of Sheikh Said (Paper No. M.E.(O) 306). THE CHAIPJIAN recalled that the question of Sheikh Said had already Been Before the Committee a month earlier, and that as a result a telegram x had Been sent to the Governor of Aden deprecating the purchase of complicated modern v/eapons By the King of the Yemen. The King’s Agent had now returned to Aden, and presented modified demands for four or five o.nti— aircraft guns, and for 10,000 gas masks. In general, he supposed that the Committee would think it desiraBle to keep the King of the Yemen satisfied, and to avoid throwing him into the arms of foreign powers. There were oBvious oBjections to an unqualified refusal of his demands. HR. GENT said that the Colonial Office would like the response to Be as accommodating as possible to the Yemeni Government, But whether the particular requests for gas masks and A.A. guns could or should Be satisfied v/as a matter for discussion. In reply to the Chairman, COLONEL CAV/THORN gave the following estimated dates of supply on the Basis of our present Rearmament Programmes Paper No. N.E.(O) 305. - 1 -1 .ervice Respirators Not 'before 1941 Vickers Guns and Barbed wire. During 1940 3' A.A. Guns None available 3.7' A.A. Guns Not before 1942 2 pdr. Bofors A.A. Guns. Our licence with the Bofors Company does not permit supply to Foreign Countries. A discussion ensued on the supply of respirators, during which it was suggested that respirators of the civilian duty type might be purchased by the Yemeni from a firm such as Siebe Gorman, or through the Home Office. It v/as pointed out that the King of the Yemen might be well advised also to purchase ancillary equipment such as protective clothing and decontamination gear. Special storage arrangements would also be necessary if the equipment were to be maintained in serviceable condition. THE SUB-COMMITTEE then considered the possibility of supplying guns. It was agreed that to give the King of the Yemen an assurance such as that lately x given to Ibn Baud might re-act to our disadvantage. The Sub-Caujnittee felt however that on political grounds it would be desirable to meet the wish of the King of the Yemen to purchase A.A. guns. If that were impossible he might be offered advice on the supply from forejgn firms of a gun of the Bofors-. type and informed that Great Britain would not * Appendix A. to Minutes of 67th Meeting, — 2 —wish to suoply other then the test, and that owing to her own Rearmament Programme such material ''Oald no available for some considerable time to come. THE SUB-COMMITTEE then considered the Imam's request for instructors. It was agreed that it was undesirable to offer British instructors in view of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. COLONEL CAWTHORN said tha* the present C.G. S. of the Yemeni forces was a retired Turkish officer and that a Turkish officer had been imported In 193? to raise and command a 'National' army, A few Italian N.C.Os. had been temporarily employed last year, mounting artillery supplied by the Italians* THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed that, at present, it was unlikely that either Egypt or Iraq would be able to provide efficient instructors, and, in view of the present state of Saudi-Iraqi relations, it might be undesirable to recommend Iraq as a source of supply. It was agreed that Turkey was the next best alternative. nOWCLUSIONS . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) That no assurance such as that lately V given to Ibn Saud, should be volunteered to the King of the Yemen, who had not hitherto requested that His Majesty's Government should define'their attitude in the case of* aggression against Yemeni Territory. (b) That on political grounds it ^as desirable so far as possible to meet the wishea of the King of the Yemen to purchase A 0 A» guns and ■ v'i TO O ' 4 “ /T TO O * Appendix A. to I inutes of 67th Meeting*, -5--» (c) That since it ''as impossible to give early delivery of service equipment, owing to the Rearmament Programmes, the Colonial Office should - (i) Pncuire from the Home Office whether and when delivery of 10,000 respirators of the civilian duty type could be made by the trade, and what ancillary equipment such as protective clothing and decontamination gear should be recommended, together with the total figure of cost. (ii) Ask the War Office to prepare a memorandum giving available information about suitable foreign sources from which the Imam might purchase his requirements of A. A. guns, together with a statement of what ancillary equipment would be necessary and also estimated total figure of cost* (d) That with regard to the point raised by the King of the Yemen as to the supoly of instructors, it was not desirable to make any specific recommendationj but it might be suggested to the King that, of the three sources mentioned by him, the Turks were most likely to be in a position to provide efficient personnel. (e) That the Colonial Office should send an interim reply to the Governor of Aden, describing the action which had been taken and suggesting that the Agent of the King of the Yemen should return to Sana’a pending a detailed reply to his request.

Telegrams from Aden. Form of assistance to the Yemen. Foreign Office view on assurances to the Yemen .~ THE YEMEN - F O RTIFICATION OF SHEIKH GAID r THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration two cipher telegrams from the Governor of Aden to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (PapersNos. M.E*(0.) 301 and 303) and a Memorandum thereon hy the Colonial Office (Paper No. McE.(0.) 302). THE CHAIRMAN referred to the telegrams from Aden, and said that the representative of the King of the Yemen was awaiting a reply. He had thought it better to call a meeting of the Sub-Committee rather than to write round Departments, which would cause delay. The brief Colonial Office Memorandum was intended to focuss the discussion. He assumed that on general grounds both political and strategical it was advisable to help the Yemen if we could. The question was in what form such help should be given. In this connection he drew attention to the following sentence in Aden telegram No. 113 (Paper No. M.E.(0.) 301) :- 36 X 'An assurance that Great Britain would give naval and air assistance to the Yemen in the event of attack by any other power would probably be the most welcome form of assistance to the King u xxx The Colonial Office Memorandum suggested that a genenal assurance in these terms would be inconsistent with the Anglo-Ital ian Agreement t MR. BAXTER referred to the first paragraph of Colonial Office Memorandum (Paper No. M.E«(0.) 302) n He thought that Article 5 of the Agreement was not pglevant to the Question oi our prGiiiSi.ng assistance to the Yemen. If any article cf the Agreement were relevant, it would be Article 2. which ran - 1 -c 'neither Party v/ill obtain or seel: to obtain a privileged position of a political character in any territory which at present belongs to Saudi Arabia or to the Yemen or in any territory which either of those States nay hereafter acquire *' On the other hand, if it was merely a question of interpretation, he thought that we could consistently witn this undertaking assure the Yemen that we would help onem to restore the position, if, in the event of general hostilities, any part of their coast were occupied by a non- Arabian power, and that such an assurance would be consistent with Article 1* of the Agreement o We had recently given what almost amounted to such an assurance to Ibn Saud in reply to his letter to the Prime Minister, asking what help we would give in the event of aggression*. 13. BAXTER then quoted the terms of the instructions which had been sent to our representative in Jedda, (attached to these minutes as Appendix A)o In reply to a question from the Chairman, 1.3. BAXTER confirmed that the assurances given to Ibn Saud had not been published® In the case of the Y-emen the Foreign Office were not convinced that it would be wise to give a similar assurance because firstly, the Italian Government might regard it as a breach of tne spirit of the Anglo—I'calian Agreement and secondly, if the Italian Government did get to know of the assurance, they might regard the Yemen as one of our satellites, and Yemeni neutrality might prove impossible. On balance there appeared to be no great advantage in giving the assurance suggested by the Government of Aden.Service views* THE CHAIRMAN then Q.ske(i 'fclie Service Represent&amp;iives for their views, WING COMMANDER ELY said that he felt that we must not go further with the King of the Yemen than with Ibn Saud. There was some advantage in having the Yemen on our G*de since otherwise they might turn to other powers for assistance. A hostile Yemen would render the position in Aden far more difficult in war, since the garrison would have to defend the frontier as well as the sea front. Hence he thought that an assurance would he advant age ous e MAJOR MALLABY agreed. The War Office considered that the aim of the King of the Yemen was to remain neutral and to avoid becoming involved in a major war. So long as the Anglo-Italian Agreement was in force we should do all we could to maintain i'fc- provisions. If it were violated by the Italians we could reconsider our position. During the recent Staff Conversations the French had brought up the necessity for countering Italian influence in the Yemen. MAJOR GROVER agreed with WING-COMMANDER ELY and MAJOR MALLABY that our interests lay in keeping the Arabian and Red Sea Coasts at least neutral. From the Strategic Admiralty point of view it was most imijortant that no importance of Sheikh Said. potentially hostile armament should command the nai\row strait between Perim and Sheikh Sa* I. THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that the Italians were already in possession of the opposite coast, and asked whether Italian possession of both sides of the Straits would make any material difference. -3— IFrench Claim to Sheikh Said Interests of the Yemen. MAJOR GROVER pointed out that coast defence armament in existing Italian territory could not command the narrow strait between Perim and Sheikh Said, It was therefore most de sirable to keep the Italians away from Sheikh Said, WING COMMANDER ELY pointed out that guis at Sheikh Said would also co' vaand 'he R 9 A.F* landing ground on Perim. TiiE CHAIRMAN referred to the French claim on Sheikh Said. MR. BAXTER confirmed that the French Foreign Office had approached our Embassy in Paris privately in the matter, and we had answered that we considered the French claim a very poor one. MR. BLAXTER suggested that the French were only reviving this claim for its nuisance value to the Italians, (it was decided later in the discussion that no communication regarding any action taken by us about Sheikh Said need be communicated to the French)o MR. HALE, speaking for himself and not for the Treasury, said that he had looked at the problem from the point of view of a specific request to fortify Sheikh Said. He thought the Italians were far more suspicious of us than the circumstances warranted. With this as a oackground, he reviewed the matter as follows (1) The Yemanuhould net. without the assistance xf a great Power, resist a great Power's attempt to occupy Sheikh Said, even if fortified. (2) The occupation of Sheikh Said by either Great Britain or Italy would be a breach of the Anglo- Italian Agreement, (3) While His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to give any undertakings, the position of Sheikh Said is such that they must clearly take gravest view —The of its occupation by another Power, Italians are in the same position. (4) The 'best security for Sheikh Said is therefore the Anglo-Italian Agreement and the importance of its non-occupation 'by one Power to other Powers interested in the Red Sea. (5) If either party to the Angio~11a1ian Agreement were to assist tho Yemen to fortify Sheikh Said, such action would cause the other party in Anglo- Italian Agreement to think (a) that the intention was hostile to them, (b) that the Yemen was party to that intention. ( 6 ) This would destroy confidence in Anglo-Italian Agreement and so increase the risk (a) of a conflict in Red Sea, (b) of the Yemen being drawn into that conflict. (7) This is contrary to the Yemen : s interests, and they would therefore be well advised to refrain from interesting any great power in fortification of Sheikh Said. He thought that we might- answer the Yemen in terms such as he had indicated and that we might also consider telling the Italians of our action not only to show that we were adhering to the provisions of the Agreement, but also to prevent them taking action. In reply to the Chairman, MR. HAL3 said that he would not supply arms. He suggested that his proposal amounted in substance to giving assurances such as we had given to Ibn Saud. THE CHAIRMAN questioned whether this would not give rise to disappointment resulting in the Yemen 'turning for arms to the Italians and the Germans.WING-COMMANDER ELY agreed. He thought the Yemenis were probably determined to obtain arms and if so it was much better for us to supply them. MR. GENT suggested that the King of the Yemen was really anxious about his position in a major war, which might produce an Italian descent on Sheikh Said. Presumably in war the Anglo-Italian Agreement would no longer exist. MR. HALE thought that it was important that if we supply arms they should not be for the specific fortification of Sheikh Said. The Italians were bound to hear rumours, which would have a deplorable effect on Anglo-Italian relations. Arms for the Yemen. WING-COMMANDER ELY and COLONEL -CAWTHORN said that the information at their disposal showed that arms were already being sold by the Italians to the Yemen. Further, three cr four Italian N.C.O’s bad recently been*- instructing the Yemenis in their use. A discussion ensued on the types of arms which would most suitably be supplied, during which the following points emerged:- (i) That it was useless to supply A.A. guns without the complicated fire control equipment needed. (ii) That if coast defence guns were supplied and mounted at Sheikh Said, they could be turned against us if that place were captured by an enemy in war. (iii) That for either A.A. or coast defence guns, skilled assistance for installation and skilled instructors would be necessary, if effective use were to be made of them. ( iv) That the Yemenis were incaxDable of maintaining the complicated equipment, and its purchase therefore probably meant a waste of money. -6-© That the 'best type of material for the Yemen would he machine guns, 'barbed wire, etc,, which could be used for the beach defence of SheiKh oaia, and was easily handled and maintained. WING-COiviMAlsDiiR hLY suggested that we should make the above considerations regarding the purchase of arms, clear to the Yemen, and point out to them that their interests marched with ours in war. This would mean action on the lines of the assurances given to Ibn o&amp;ud. MR, HAL.a enquired whether we could seize Sheikh against ' Said from Aden in war. Sheikh Said from Aden in MAJOR MaLLaBY and VING-COMMAtfDBR BLY were doubtful whether this was possible. The latter pointed out that the maintenance of a garrison at Sheikh Said would be difficult. COLONkL CnVTHORN thought that the Yemen wished to remain neutral, but might not be able to withstand pressure from Italy in the event of war. The attempt to obtain arms from us might be an endeavour to get something on the cheap, WING-COMMAl\OSR JLY agreed, but thought that there was a general fear underlying the aemana. MR. BLAXTUR said that Captain Seager, the Aden Protectorate Frontier Officer wno was at the moment in Sana’a had intimated that the occupation of Albania by the Italians had maue a deep impression on the Yemen, and that the present was the crucial moment for an approach to the Yemen. THE CHAIRMAN agreed, and suggested that we should tell the King of the Yemen that he had nothing to fear in peace time owing to the terms of the Anglo-1 tali an Agreement. - 7 -The statement might continue that in war with the Italians hostile, the Anglo-Italian Agreement would be null and void. In that case, the political and strategical interests of Great Britain were so bound up with those of Yemen that it was obvious that we should do what we could to assist him. MR. BAXTER said that we must avoid giving the impression that the Anglo-Italian Agreement implied any undertaking to the Yemen. COLONEL CAWTEORN pointed out that both the King of the Yemen and Ibn Saud had objected to the Agreement. MR. GENT thought that a declaration could be framed which did not imply that the Anglo-Italian Agreement gave any undertaking to the Yemen. We would merely repeat the declaration of our essential interest which was etcted already in Article 3 of the Agreement, which would mean an assurance much on the same lines as tne one given to Ibn Saud. MAJOR MALLABY suggested that the reply should first of all ^ &gt;tail the objections to the supply of armament, indicated at , X t above, and point out that the best defence for the Yemen was neutrality. It would then continue with some form of assurance such as the one given to Ibn Saud. MAJOR GROVER agreed. The Admiralty were most reluctant to supply arms to the Yemen in any form. MR. BAXTER still thought that the reply might give some indication of our willingness to supply arms, in order to prevent the Yemen from turning to other powers.C0L0N3L CAWTHORN said that the War Office were not really in a position to produce supplies, without prejudicing their other commitments. Continuing, MAJOR MALLABY suggested that if the King of the Yemen ^eaoted unfavourably to the form of reply which he had indicated previously, it would be necessary to refer the matter to the Chiefs of Staff as a question of defence policy. MR. BAXTER thought that we should return as friendly and helpful a reply as possible to the King of the Yemen’s request for/advice. We could make use of Article 5. of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, and explain that we were in full sympathy with the King’s wish to maintain complete ' neutrality. CONCLUSION . It was agreed to invite the Colonial Office to circulate a draft telegram to the Governor of Aden, giving instructions for a reply to the representative of the King of the Yemen on the lines of ’Y' above. Note by the Secretary . A draft telegram has now been circulated and is attached as Appendix ’B f . The telegram as dispatched ia its final form will be circulated in due course.

As His Majesty 1 s Government have already explained, they do not think it in the least likely that Saudi Arabia will 'be wantonly attacked. Even if general hostilities should 'begin it is unlikely that Italy would attempt to occupy positions on the Saudi- Arabian coast, since they already possess 'bases in Eritrea which are in a more favourable strategical position from which to threaten British communications in the Red Sea, Nor is it likely that Italy will wish to add Saudi Arabia to her enemiesc But in the unlikely event of Itajy taking such action, His Majesty’s Government in their own interests, if for no other reason, would take steps to restore the position.I,i . 11 , ( 0 ) i.linu te s of 6 ?tli Ueetinr ap^itdi:: b .

Acting on this assumption, His Majesty's Government would suggest, as their advice has been sought by King, that the erection of fortifications on Yemeni Coast with assistance of any foreign Power could hardly fail to arouse suspicion and resentment in other quarters and would be calculated to endanger neutral status of Yemen in event of war © They would therefore i - 11 - r0 strongly advise that it is in I£in£ ! s 'best interests not to pursue plan of increasing fortifications at 3 heil:h Said or elsewhere on Yemeni Coast.ends.

Qadhi Hussein El Halali told me to-day he has information from Sana that Italian doctor there has approached the King with proposals to supply armaments for the protection of Sheikh Said against the French and has even suggested temporary Italian occupation of the place until danger passed. Qadhi Hussein El Halali therefore presses all the more urgently for British help both in obtaining armaments and some financial assistance. As regards training of personnel in the use of guns he says that the Imam would prefer Moslem instructors from Egypt, Syria m* Iraq if they are to be employed permanently but that he would welcome British instructors as temporary measure. In that case he hopes that they can be sent from Aden Garrison rather than especially from England which would draw more attention to their mission. Seager reports from Sana that the Yemen is very nervous about the international situation and its possible effects on that country which desires not only British sympathy but also evidence preferably in the shape of material help. He considers that failure to respond to requests made will be regarded as due to inability rather than unwillingness to comply and might result in Yemen surrender to Italian pressure.

Requests of King of Yemen and your recommendations have been carefully eizamined in consultation with other interested Departments with conclusion that it is considered undesirable in present circumstances that Kis Majesty*s Government should accept new formal commitment to secure Yemen against aggression. In first place at any rate attempt should be made to dissuada King from pursuing his proposal to strengthen defences of Yemeni Coast# It is therefore thought best that at this stage reply to vadhi for conrnanication to King should bo on following lines# BEGINS. His Majesty’s Government have received the oral request from the King of the Yemen for their advice and assistance regarding His Majesty’s wish to place the Peninsula of Shaikh Said in an adequate state of defence, and thus to deter a potential aggressor from an attempt to seize it by force, in the same way as other territories hc.ve in the recent past been seized by aggressor Powers from their rightful owners# The consideration given by His Majesty’s Government to this request has led them to form certain conclusions which they think it well to place before His Majesty in the hope that they may be of assistance to him in reaching a decision on these matters. ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER ] N*. 2 3 2 9JUN1939 -'TTl SECRETARY, POUTICAl Afo [ -'T DEPT. INDIA OFF 1 ';2. The King of the Yemen will be aware that His Majesty's Government have recently made an open declaration (Article 3 of the Anglo-Italian Agreement regarding certain areas in the Middle East) that they regard it as one of their essential interests that no other Power should acquire sovereignty or any privileged position on any part of the coast of the Red Pea which at present belongs to the Yemen. His Majesty will therefore appreciate from this declaration that His Majesty's Government have every sympathy with his wish to prevent any ^ower from occupying his territory, and to ensure that the Yemeni forces defending the Shaikh Said Peninsula are able to repel an attack* 3# The question then arises what measures should be taken to prevent Shaikh Said from falling into the hands of an enemy Power. Would it, for example, be possible to construct on the Peninsula such fortifications, armed with modern guns, as could withstand any attack? It is the considered opinion of His Majesty’s Government that no attempt should be made to construct such fortifications. This evidently could not be done without the help of foreign technical experts. If His Majesty were to turn to some foreign Power for this technical assistance, the result would probably be to arouse suspicion and resentment in other quarters. It is assumed that the King’s policy in the event of a general war would be directed to maintaining the neutrality of the vemen; but the presence at Shaikh Said of the military experts of a foreign Power, engaged in the construction of fortifications, would be likely merely to endanger the neutral status of the Yemen in the event of war. 4 . The same observations would apply to the provision of any guns which would require to be mounted and looked after by foreign experts. Indeed the presence of such guns -4-at Shailen said might cause a potential aggressor to look upon the peninsula as a more tempting and valuable prize. 5* Moreover, if His Majesty’s Government may counsel the King on another similar point, it would seem best that any arms which may be acquired by the Yemeni forces should be of such a nature as to be easily and efficiently handled by them, without the need for calling in the assistance of foreign experts. It would be a waste of money for His Majesty to purchase complicated modern weapons such as anti aircraft guns and the elaborate fire control equipment which is essential for working anti-aircraft guns efficiently - , unless there were units of the Yemeni forces who were fully trained in the use of such weapons. On the other hand, much may be done to prevent hostile landings by simple and comparatively inexpensive methods, e.g. by preparing wire entanglements on the beaches, and defending them by machine-gun fire. To sum up, the advice which His Majesty’s Government would offer would be to purchase mainly such material as the Yemeni forces are already trained to use. 6 . If His Majesty, having considered these views should wish to state his requirements in more detail, as well as the approximate sum which he is prepared to spend, His Majesty’s Government would be happy to advise him in further detail regarding the material which they would consider most suitable for his purposes.

Qadhi Hussein Bib Halali has been sent to Aden by the Crown Prince of the Yemen ostensibly to discuss frontier question but has explained that the main purpose of his visit is really to deliver orally a message of importance to me personally. At our interview he told me that he had been sent under instructions Oj. the *^ing of the Yemen who is much concerned at present international situation and particularly with regard to safety of Sheixh Said opposite Per&amp;n. I asxied whether the iving fears attacx by any particular power and Qadhi replied that he had been alarmed by recent reports of designs on this place and also by the aggressive policy of Italy especially since her action in Albania which had caused deep impression in the Yemen. But he added that the King was concerned not so much at danger from any particular power as at the international situation and the possibility of general war in the event of which he was convinced that attempt wo til d be made by all belligerents to obtain possession of important strategic points of which Sheixh Baid and neighbouring Straits are prominent examples. King therefore wishes to put Sheixh ''enclosure m weekly letter N«. 2 3 2 9JUN1939 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. I NDIA OFFICESaid into a state of defence against air and sea attacks and for this purpose wants anti-aircraft and other guns and other equipment such as gas mas^s. hadhi said that the ohject of his mission is to see^ the advice and help of the British u-overnment in this matter. He said that his master turns to us both because he has confidence in the policy of His Majesty's Government towards himself and because he feels that the two Governments have common interest in defence of ohei^vh Said, security of which is of equal if not greate. importance to .Jngland that to the Yemen. One additional reason not mentioned by fadhi is that the ;ving believes that he can rely on getting better material through the British Government than from the Italians who have often sold him munitions of inferior quality. Qadhi explained that present defences at this place consist of some Yemeni troops and three obsolete guns of no value and are therefore quite inadequate. Air Officer Commanding is of the opinion that some form of military understanding with the Yemen in the event of major'- war would be useful in connection with the defence of Aden and any assistance now given might facilitate such an understanding if the circumstances required it. In any case it would be to our advantage to prevent enemy occupation of oheixh Baid and presumably our naval and air forces would try to do so in the event of war in which case some degree of co-operation even if not very effective from th uresent holders of the place would be desirable. These are reasons for favourable consideration of the Yemeni request, and wrther reason is that, if we refuse, the ning may turn to other foreign powers for -2-what he wants and either the Italians or the G-errnans might he very ready to comply. On the other hand therv are obvious objections such as tne probable reaction of the Italians, who however do not themselves scruple to provide the Yemen with munitions, finance is important consideration. Qadhi assures me that the ^ing is ready to spend considerable sum on the defence of this position, but has hinted that some rinancial help might be given by Britain in view of its importance to us. If it is decided to respond to the Yemeni request, question arises what form of armament should be recommended. Air Officer Commanding considers that it ought not to be of nature that might be danger to Be rim or navigation of Straits, but should be sufficient to be of some use to the garris/on for the prevention of hostile landing on beaches. He is therefore opposed to long range coast defence guns and favours some form of fixed quicxi firing guns with maximum range of 4,000 yards. Air Officer Commanding is not in favour oj. anti-aircraft guns owing to the risx that they might be used against us and from the Yemeni point of view are expensive and complicated and probably of little value. There is further consideration that it is most inadvisable that we should set example of helping the Yemen obtain really powerful 0 uns. It is therefore better to limit assistance, if given, to small guns, suggested above, crews to which should be -3-provided wit.i t,as roasts while heaches shoula he wired. Naval Officer in charge at ^den agrees. .--h assurance that Great Britain would &amp; ive naval and air assistance to the Yemen in the event of attac.. hy any other power would prohahly he most welcome form of assistance to the -mg and would he most effective form of defence from our point of view hut His ..ajesty's Government may see objection to giving guarantee of this nature and 1 shall naturally not suggest it unless you authorise ne to do so. ^3hal he grateful for early reply as Qadhi is waiting for Aden and I shall he glad to mow what response I can make to him.(T..io .uccuu^ is tii^! gacgSOT c-F .ix£&gt; iiAj^STy'b auviiaia^KT). kPY 1:0. /Z !

(Previous Paner A»5.(0)501) The reply to the final paragraph of the telegram must presumably he that a guarantee of active assistance to the Yemen on the lines propsed would he inconsistent with the provisions of Article 5 of the .uiglo-Italian Agreement, 1958. Y/ith regard to the integrity of Yemeni territory in general against an outside attack, it may perhaps he assumed that the Imam's apprehensions are directed primarily against Italy. He might he reminded of the .agreement between Great Hritain and Italy, which should have the effect of relieving his apprehensions* As far as Sheikh Said itself is concerned, the Imam seems to suspect that an occasion may arise for Trance actively to assert its rights in tiiat area. It is for consideration whether some assurance could he obtained from the French Government which we could -pass on to the Imam. (There has been semi-official correspondence between the Foreign Office and the Gritish mbassy in Paris on this subject.) As regards the supply of munitions, the Governor seems clearly right in recommending that any such supplyshould be restricted, as he suggests, equipment, but it will be appreciated ;o sroadl ^uns : and that the Yemeni Government may seeh some form of financial assistance even for such limited armaments.

The King was concerned over French claims to Perim Island [Jazīrat Mayyūn] and Sheikh Said, and was seeking anti-aircraft and gas equipment from the UK and Italy.The file consists of correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the War Office, and the Governor of Aden (Bernard Reilly). Telegrams from Reilly provide details of meetings with Qadhi Hussein el Halali, the King's representative, regarding the defence of Yemen.The file also includes several documents from the 67th and 68th meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence's Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Governing the Middle East, discussing the fortification of Sheikh Said. The following topics are discussed: the importance of maintaining Yemeni neutrality in the event of a conflict between European powers; the provision of equipment and training by the UK; the need to operate within the terms of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938; French claims to Perim and Sheikh Said; and pre-existing British commitments to Ibn Sa'ūd.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
