H. RU’s Consulate and ^ Political Agency, Kn\ MP3CAT . 30th Septeiriber, 1951 My dear Kempson, Many thanks for yonr letter No. 13A/112 dated the 30th September 1951. 2. I think that the names of the oil companies have been confused. As far as I know the Sultan only gave concessions to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. The Dhofar Concession has, incidentally, recently been abandoned by the Company. However, I now see what the Sultan means, and I fancy it is only a safeguard for the unforseeable future, and no particular project* or/pro 3©ct that the Sultan ha? in mind. Yours sincerely, t- f M.

My dear Le Quesne, Please refer to your letter No. 1439/7 dated the 21st Septem'ber 1951. 2. I enclose a copy of a reply to my guery received from the local ^anager of cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. I think they have confused Petroleum Development Ltd for Pertoleum Concessions Ltd, the latter being the Company to which the Sultan has given^ jCT Concessions. As the Dhofar one has been terminated by the Company, it is possible that the Sultan has some other company in view there, but I think not. 3. I am also confident that the Sultan has no actual plans in view, and these insertions are no more than safeguards for unfo^seen possibilities. ^ Yours sincerely, C. M.

It Is not thought that he had any particular development in mind at the time but that it grew out of section (B). This safeguards certain rights already granted to Petroleum Development Ltd and it is thought that the Sultan did not wish to tie himself down with Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd to any conditions which might restrict the terms of, or limit his freedom in, any grant which he might make in the future to other large development companies. This Article, not unnaturally,has had to be re-drafted several times in an endeavour to reach a form which would be mutually acceptable. This indicates that the Sultan was quite determined that, in one form or another,it should appear in the Licence.Confidential. 30/12/1/51. H.B.M’s Consulate Political Agency, MUSCAT. 2?th Sept: 1951 My dear Kempsm, Please refer to Article 11 of the first enclosure to your letter C of the 4th September 1951. 2. The last lines of this Article refer to 'A Large Development Company” and leave the Sultan the right to give it permission to ooerate its own wireless telecommunication. Was this put in at the Sultan’s instance and if so have you any idea what he had in mind when asking for this addition : Yours sincerely, M. T. Kemp son Esq, The ^anager, Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd.

The last Splines of Article 11 seem to be interesting. Presume y y were added at the instance of the Sultan. If so they look like evidence of a greater interest in large-scale development than he has hitherto snown.

The two units referred to in our letter are in addition to the one already installed and are part of an entirely different project. As the unit already in operation was supplied on a special request and under special circumstances we would prefer that the question /of power supply for this unit ^and the two 1 proposed units 'be treated as tjio distinct and 'separate items.

I am expecting the Ministry of Works Electrical iungineer here about the 18th instant, and I thihk it would be better to await his arrival before replying finally to your letter under reference. But I think I can safely say that as we also are installing air conditioning, until we receive our switchboard, and can run two engines in parallel, it is likely to prove impossible to supply you with any more power than you are already getting. I presume the units^ proposed to be installed are in addition to tne one you have now. M.T.

His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Muscat. Dear Sir, VJe are looking into the question of supplying air-conditioning plants in the quarters occupied hy our F 1 English Mobile Staff and naturally the first essential is to ensure that power will be available for the units if they are installed. There would be two units, probably of the ‘’Climatizer' type and they would together take a total current of between eight and ten amps when running with a starting surge on each unit of up to ten amps. This surge is momentary only. V’ould you please inform us if the Consulate power supply would be able to supply the necessary power for these units.

I objected to a previous draft in my letter 277/2/49 of the 14th June, ^ 1949 to Burrows and the reply I received in Rogers T letter d 7613/1433/91 of the 29th July, 1949 left me in some doubt regarding the extent to which v/e are responsible for ’’vetting ,f agreements between Cable and v/ireless and local Rulers. From certain com nts, however, which we have recently received from General Department on the Dubai agreement, vide Sarell’s letter bo. G. b 19/10 of the 19th March, it would appear that we have some responsibility for ensuring that such agreements are In order. 2. The Muscat draft still contains the clause quoted in paragraph 2 of our letter 277/3/30 of the 16th February, 1930 to General Department, but as there is no specific mention of Gwadur, we e ’.oiot very well object to this. Otherwise, X do not think tie re is anything in the draft •which calls for action on our part. 3. 1 end os- herewith the copy of the draft which I obtained in Muscat and should be grateful if it or a copy of it ild kindly be returned to roe in due course.

The desire of both the Sultan and the Company appears to be that His Majesty's Government should take no part in the negotiations on the spot through the Consul until or unless need arises, but the local/Manager has been instructed to keep me confidentially informed of progress in the manner of this enclosure.

Tne Cable ana Wireless Lta. view is that if any other Company at remote places in His Highness* territories has permission to communicate within the Sultanate, its communications for places outside should properly circulate via Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Muscat. This is consistent with the principle agreed (please see the latter part of Article II) for the possible erection of stations for His Highness, the telegrams from which, when destined for places outside the Sultanate, are to be handled by Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Muscat. Re:- Article 2 . It should be noted that since the amended draft was received from His Highness, in May 1950, the Company have reduced its charges from Muscat to India (by )&gt; Aden (by 33%) f to Bahrain (by 28% ), to Kuwait (by 28% ). to Europe (by 26%) and to many other places. Nevertheless the Comp-any, in tne special circumstances, is prepared additionalxy to allow a rebate of 10% on the above reduced charges on State telegrams to all destinations in the British Commonwealth (other than Pakistan as this tariff is already extremely low) but including Bahrain and Kuwait. Such an arrangement would be confirmed by letter from the Co-mp&amp;ny to His Highness and would not be referred to in the Licence. Re:- Article lu . The Company would prefer to have this Article omitted but as His Highness wishes it induced, we think it reasonable chat if and when His Highness exercises the option to purcnase the wireless station the Company should be allowed to o-perate an emergency wireless equipment themselves to cover any temporary disorganisation of the cable system at Muscat, consequently it is hoped His Highness will agree to the last sentence which has been added to this Article.9' mmm 0 W \ LOi^DON V JAlt • 1931.
