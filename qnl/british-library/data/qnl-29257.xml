Bushire, the 11th October, 1933. Thank you for your private and personal letter dated the 14th September 1933. I am glad to hear that my telegrams have been useful to you. 2. You said that you were not quite clear as to how the initial circular was to be distributed on the Trucial Coast. I did not actually take it up myself, as 1 only went to the ’Trucial Coast after meeting the Riot ilia and visiting Basidu. ^he circular was, however, telegraphed to Bahrain and Burnett was kind enough to let me have the use of a 'Rangoon” to take it up to Sharjah to the Residency Agent, as there was no mail or air mail going up just then. The circulars got round very quickly and were, I think, effective. The Arab, of course, fixed on the essential points that we had landed an armed party and followed it up immediately by a ”naval demonstration”. So far, so good. The only criticism has been that the action taken was not drastic enough as it did not include making the Persians re-hoist the TLag (this is their own idea of what was fitting). The important thing now is to avoid any action, or omission, which may make the Arab Littoral think that we are not in earnest and shall allow these things to slip back again. 3. I would beg of you to consider carefully what I wrote to you last week of the 'Lawrence”,- .J. The lABADA' of Australia fjp? ZEALAND '1IIOH OF SOUTH AFRICA KISH FREE STATE EWFGUMELAND ng Street October, 1933 iroulw despatch A.Hgj, 4'!j r e t. Sir, My Lord, I have the honour to state, for the information of Hie Majesty’s Government in Canada the Commonwealth of Men Zealand the Union of South Africa the Irish j'ree state Mewfoundland that an incident recently occurred at B&amp;sidu, a naval * station* * in the Persian Gulf where the British flag had been flown without interruption for over 100 years. The station, a small place on the Persian Island of %ishm f has been treated by Mis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as a British concession, but, notwithstand ing the long period of uninterrupted tenure the title to occupy it has hitherto been regarded as doubtful. (This question is being further investigated). For many years no use has been made of the concession and it will be observed from Article V of the draft General Treaty with Persia enclosed in my confidential despatch Dominions Ho.545 of the 13th October, 1930, that it was intended to hand over any rights possessed at Basidu to Persia as part of the general settlement with that country.2. Xhe facts of the incident are as follows:- On the 31st July, four Persian naval officers, amongst them the off Soar commanding the Persian fleet, landed at Basidu from a gunboat and hauled down the British flag in the presence of certain witnesses, including a Frenchman and an Italian, The flag was unattended at the time, the caretaker being away. Subsequently the flag was rehoisted by one of His Majesty’s sloops with an armed guard over it. 3. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaire® at Teheran that this outrage was committed without the knowledge or con sent of the Persian Government or of the 3hah. In reply to strong semi-official representations which the Chargl &amp;’Affaires made, pending the receipt by him of instruc tions as to the demands to be put forward officially, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs statedthat hie Government sincerely deplored the occurrence of the incident and had, on the Shah’s instructions, issued categorical orders to the Persian Navy to avoid all interference with British naval arrangements, to collabo rate in all possible ways with His Majesty’s Bhip® stationed in the Gulf, and in future to report for orders before taking any action *when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind”. The Minister for Foreign Affairs further stated that the officer responsibleI the rehoisting of the flag and the eubstance of the coimunication which had been received from the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs. 6. Meanwhile, His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires was instructed to endeavour to obtain from the Persian Government an official note recapitulating the oral statements and assurances already received, and, as a result, the following note signed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was received:- M In the course of recent interviews you have expressed anxiety concerning certain events which have recently taken place in the Persian Gulf. 'In spite of the fact that I was aware of the good intentions of the Imperial Government and that I had assured you on that point, I made enquiries from the proper quarter and find that these actions were not based on any specific instructions. For this reason instructions have been issued to acting commander of Southern Havy that he is to apply for instructions to hie headquarters in special questions which may arise and which have oninternational bearing* He has also been reminded that,sine# it is necessary that in future navy of Imperial Government should co-operate with the British navy in the Persian Gulf, policy of Imperial Government is that complete friendship and sincerity should exist between the navy of His Britannic Majesty’s Government and that of the Imperial Government. In view oi this, A1 mn very happy to “be able to confirm ^hat 2 already informed you by word of mouth.” 7. This note was not regarded as entirely satisfactory in that it contained no definite expression of regret, and did not recapitulate the assurances previously given to the Charge d’Affaires orally; a note was therefore sent to the Persian Government which, after acknowledging receipt of the Persian note, recorded the confirmation contained in it of the statements already made orally to the Charge d’Affaires viz . ■ that the Persian action at Basidu was un authorised and disapproved of by the Persian Government: that disciplinary action had been taken and orders issued with a view to preventing action by the Persian levy which might lead to international incidents: and that orders had bean issued to avoid interference in the British naval arrangements and, in particular, to ensure that Persian naval officers should report for orders before taking action in future when confronted with an unusual situation of an international character. The note went on to say that on the basis of the above statements and assurances of the Persian Government both written and oral His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were glad to be able to consider the incident as closed.

With regard to paragraph 4(a), the gravity of this calculated and deliberate insult is intensified in the Persian Gulf where peoples of the surrounding littoral states lajrpeculiar stress on the importance and signification of these national emblems. It is perhaps relevant to mention that the Persians have prohibited the flags formerly ilown for many years in the telegraph concessions. They have stopped the flying of the Union Jack at masts in the grounds of the Consulates, and I understand that they even object to the badges (with a Union Jack device) on the hats of Consular messengers. Yet responsible Persian Naval Officers, who are fully aware of its significance, had no hesitation in hauling down and trampling on the British Flag in British territory. Within an hour it was proclaimed by Persian Officials in Persian territory. Good propaganda saw to it that the main details of the desecration were not omitted and rumour spread as it only can in these parts. The damaging effect to British Prestige in the Gulf, which stood so high but a few years ago, can best be minimised by effective and visible reparation in the place where the insult was perpetrated. It is the only methodjinderstood .... .Those who know the Arab and Persian mentality here will realise that it would be an added blow to our prestige should British Basidu be ceded to the Persians after an affair of such a nature. K)./ x X X10 . BASISu. 'BIDEJ^ORD’S' wireless report of the Basidu outrage was received on the afternoon of 5th August. 'SHORSHAM' proceeded to sea at once and on arrival at Bushire the following morning, I held a discussion on the situation with the Honourable the Political Resident. It could he seen from the reports that the natives were in an excited and frightened condition. As it was necessary to obtain definite information and sufficient proof before effective action could be taken in a case of such gravity, the Honourable the Political Resident very kindly placed his Munshi at my disposal for the purpose of making further enquiries in conjunction with my Interpreter. Leaving Bushire a.nu on 7th August, 'SHOREHAM' arrived at British Basidu on the evening of 8th August. The enquiry commenced the same evening. It is one of the most difficult things to obtain reliable information from Arabs in an excitable state, and I soon realised and appreciated the great value of the Munshi and am most grateful to the Honourable the Political Resident for his services. On 10th August, I was able to telegraph a report of my investigations. On 12th August, I proceeded oo Lingeh to intercept the up mail steamer by which the written report and evidence of witnesses was forwarded to the Honourable the Political Resident. There is no doubt from an examination of the Flag as well as from the evidence of the witnesses that the Flag was deliberately torn, with tears in four places, quite apart from the fraying by wind at the fly. It is confirmed by the report spread on the evening of the occurrence in Persian territory by the Mudir of Customs and his Farrach that the Officers of the 'PALANG' hauled down the Flag and tore it. x x xx x X II ,666/E. 1.156. s £.\;retary of the admiralty.

The text of our note to the Persians on the first Basidu incident is flagged. The Persian reply 1 which is not wholly satisfactory ( is contained in Teheran telegram of 9 October No.256 on P.Z.6534. ifr. Mallets comment on it is given in Teheran telegram of 11th October, Mo.257 on P.Z. 6551/33, flagged. Mth the telegram in question he submitted a tentative draft reply to the Persians, but remarked (para.7) that he did not think that the Persian Government expected an answer at all, and that it might be best not to send one unless it was felt that the last word must not be with the Persian Government. The Foreign Office now recommend that no reply should be sent. 2. The Persian note, as Mr.Mallet says, is silly and not very satisfactory, but, as he also remarks, it would be a mistake to take it too seriously. We have really secured tasa essential desideratum in securing a reply in anodyne terms from the Persian Government to our Note of 23 September recapitulating the explanations and assurances given by that Government as the result of the first Basidu incident; and we are now in a position, should further difficulty arise with the Persians over the | settlement of the incident, to publish our note and their reply. The one point on which the Persian reply expresses inability to follow the ten® of our note is of secondary importance,and it would I j think ’ 136 undignified to continue to wrangle over points of minor importance (and unlikely in any case that we should succeed in getting the last word). I submit that we may, in the light of the Foreign Office/ 1712b 5000 3/330 Office letter, concur in the action which they propose. 3. There is, however, a second Persian Note arising out of the Basidu incident the position of which will call for consideration. It will he remenfcered that the Persian Government sent us a forml protest (Teheran telegram 222 of 21st September at P.Z.6037/33) against the landing of British marines at Basidu. Mr .Mallet at once protested against this Note and told the acting Foreign Minister that he could not accept it. The Foreign Office instructed him on 23rd September * (No. 162,P.Z.6121/33) that the question of the action to be taken in regard to it would be considered further as soon as the Persian reaction to our Note of protest on the Basidu incident was known. ”1 have no objection to Persian note being regarded as being in cold storage in the meantime”. ( On the same day Mr.. Mallet reported (No.226, P.Z.6121/33) in connection with the settlement of the Basidu incident that the Shah H wished as an assurance that the incident was really closed that we should as soon as possible remove troops from Basidu. As soon as this happened he authorised Sepahbodi to take back the Note (see my telegram No.222) as ’non-avenue*.* 4. We have not so far removed our guard from Basidu and while we had originally been disposed to remove it within say two or three weeks of the receipt of a satisfactory Persian answer to our Note of 23 September, the recent Basidu incident may make it rmre difficult for us to take action on these lines. On the other hand it is undesirable to allow the^Persian note with its explicit claim to sovereignty over Basidu to remain long in our possession and unansv/ered, particularly in view of the recent developments in regard to the status of/712b 5000 3.33 dinute Paper.

The Foreign Office are considering the question of the action to-be taken and we shall be consulted further regarding it in due course. 5. I attach a draft letter to the Foreign Office.

I *W O* V. or 4 / it. y Sir, With reference to Foreign Office letter No. E 6085/1273/34 of the 12th October, enclosing copies of two telegrams from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Tehran regarding the correspondence exchanged in connexion with the recent incident at Basidu, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he strongly supports Mr. Mallet’s suggestion, contained in paragraph 7 of his telegram No. 257, that it is preferable to ignore the Persian note and treat it as a mere acknowledgment of Mr. Mallet’s note signifying the willingness of His Majesty’s G-overnment to regard the incident as closed. In regard to the first of the two points referred to in the Persian note, it is clearly not incumbent on His Majesty’s Government to interpret, for the benefit of the Persian Government, a clear and self-evident assurance which was received from the Persian Prime Minister (then Minister for Foreign Affairs) and of which the authorship has not been denied; while on the second point Mr. Mallet has already, in conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, furnished adequate explanations in vindication of the action of His Majesty’s Government. 2.

In spite of the fact that I was aware of the (good) intentions of the Imperial Government, and that I had assured you on that point, I made enquiries from the proper quarters, and find that these action© were not “based on any specific instructions* For this reason Instructions have been issued to the Acting Gomaander of the -Southern Navy that he is to apply for instruction© to his head-quarters in special questions which may arise and which have an international bearing. He has also been reminded that since it is necessary that in future the navy of the Imperial Government should co-operate with th© British navy in the Persian Gulf* the policy of the Imperial Government is that complete friendship and sincerity should exist between the navy of His Britannic Majesty’s Government and that of the Imperial Government. In view of this, I am very happy to be able to confirm what I had already informed u you by word of mouth# I take this opportunity#:0 In any further communicatipn on tins subject, please quote No. /Z bo tS'/ /l and address —not to any person by name,J6xxt to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. i. l*m « fNDMj( DIRECT ’• ^0 j^pyiD'li O J I THE Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his comnliments to ^ ^ ipliments to and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop^^^ of the under-mentioned paper, y Foreign Office, Reference to previous correspondence : F&gt; rU^CCZv' ^ £ (&amp;0 JS [ ^ Description of Enclosure.

Since our last conversation over the telephone on the subject, des of Mallet’s telegrams Nos will see from paragraph 4 of the former that he now attaches no further importance from the Persian point of view to the issue of a communiqu£ on the lines originally proposed* In any case, I doubt whether the rather shortened communique which you suggest would quite have served the purpose he had in mind of really improving the atmosphere in Tehran. 3. Prom our point of view, I do not think any further communique is needed. What has already been said to the press does not seem to need any supplementing. Ithwaite, Esq. thoughthough it might have needed correction, and we feel sure that we shall gain nothing hy pursuing further the announcement made hy the Persian Consul-General in India. 4. In the circumstances, we should now prefer to let the whole question of the proposed communique drop, and if you agree with this we will inform Mallet hy telegram accordingly. 5.

Hhen we tell him in our note that incident is closed he expects us to act in that spirit. Otherwise we give him grounds for accusing us of deliberate mis-statement.

Any public or even private humiliation by us of the Shah during Kara,khan's visit which begins September 29th will earn us the Shah's undying enmity and we shall have played directly into the hands of the Soviet government.

I am filled with foreboding at the contents of the second paragraph of Tehran telegram of September 25th, Ho.89, and fear that acting Minister for Foreign Affairs remarks presage (a) refusal or long delay in giving redress in cases in which protests have already been made and (b) an attempt to assert a claim for the Persian Havy to have rights of search.

Charge d'Affaires had been rather more optimistic about ultimate communique than I felt able to be. Nevertheless I said that if His Majesty's Government were really satisfied that Persian Government intended incident closed I would nture to again suggest to you the idea of communique. 6 . Sepahbodi said the Shah was sure to ask him what, about troops at Basidu. I repeated what you had told Persian Charge d'Affaires and added that troops were not marines, merely the usual armed guards. He objected that they had machine guns and I said that all detachments of mis majesty's forces wore usually so armod nowadays. He repeated that the shah would look to us to re-embark armed guards as an earnest that the incident was finished. I - at I had no authority to make any promise whatever.

He gave me full account of his interview last night with the Shah ? at which Prime minister was present, 2. lie found the Shah calmer and for the first time was really allowed time to explain without interruption and insults a The Shah was given explanation in paragraph 5 of yoar cej_egiam Ncn 150 „ as to why publication became inevitable and eventually understood el forts of His Majesty’s Government had prevented far more serious outburst in the press, though he still resented the phraseology employed. He was much excited at hearing Irench and Italians had been present at basidu and jumped to the conclusion that they might have instigated Major Easendor to haul down the flag. The Shdi then became very thoughtful and frequently repeated how surprised he had all along been that his officers could have behaved so foolishly but now he had perhaps found the clue* 5o He then ordered Sepahbodi to tell me that His Majesty wished to thank me for my efforts to prevent situation developing badly (a very different tone from day before when be had accused me of tricking Feroughi). He said 'assure Cnarge d f Affaires that last thing we ever wanted was that such anar incident should have occurred to mar our excellent relations”. I was also to he told that His majesty had personally given clearest and most categorical orders to Persian navy to work in most intimate spirit of collaboration with British navy and that he knew his navy v/as animated hy this desire. His Majesty had no desire in any manner to attempt to diminish prestige of British navy in the Persian Gulf. 4* The Shah went on to consider suggestions v/hich Sepahhodi had made to me regarding liquidation of crisis. He particularly wanted something to appear in British wireless news here which could he reprinted hy the Persian Press on the following lines. 5, There should he an explanation that while Great Britain had a concession and certain rights at Basidu (? soil of) whole of Kishm Island belonged to Persia. The statement should add that incident of flag had been discussed in most friendly way between the two g .vernments without question of either official protest or apology and explanations which had resulted suffioed t) clear whole matter. 6. Furthermore His Majesty wished as an earnest that incident was really closed that we should as soon as possible remove troops from Basidu. as soon as this happened he authorised Sepahbodi to take back note (see my telegram 11^222) 'non avenue”. 7.

I agree your version is better. Perhaps it is hardly necessary to add second sentence as wh£it you have drafted would suffice for the Shah. As regards paragraph 1 suggested in my telegram No, 218 I would much prefer now that it should merely read as in my immediately following telegram. This version is briefer and-would surely be preferable to the Shah. It would be worse than useless to publish at all unless we can be confident that publication will achieve the desired object. -o! him to have sent me message recorded in my telegram No. _226 must have caused him a real effort and his agreement to idea that his note about troops should remain like i^ahomet's coffin and be finally returned to him struck Sepahbodi as an astonishing act of real friendship towards us. 5. 1 am convinced that ohah does not want to quarrel with us and will himself when the time Domes make a serious effort to get treaty through. He will have reroughi at his elbow’* who, if we save him now will be doubiy well disposed. I also suspect that Sepahbodi may fill vacant court appointment after new Minister for ■ o.reign Affairs has tok bii over. 6 , We have shown the Shah that there are limits t0 P a 'tience and I thinly that he respects us for it in his heart. But he will not tolerate any form of public humiliation which might weaken his internal position and obeolence of his (gr.undec.) towards him e I therefore aghast at idea that notes exchanged may be published and plead with all earnestness that not only this but even mention of notes’ existence may bo avoided. Any publication would result in such fury that Feroughi would certainly be eternally ruined and I shoiild be accused of double dyed trickery c If I had suggested possibility of publication Peroughi certainly would not have written his note, so accusation would not be quite unfounded. But I had imagined from your tolegram Po, 130 that there was no Question of this though. I all along feared that press might get hold of news, 7c I am for those reasons much relieved to read that you do not intend to issue to Arab sheikhs second statement about notes. To do so would, after bhah’s messages/messages to rne today, prodatly have almost as disastrous result here as publication of Parliamentary papers. 8 . Shah considers that he has Pledged his word to us three times over and he cannot understand why we still, allow two months old dispute to rankle. Prom moment he first sent orders to his fleet he considered P-Ci,..ent clooel. nut ix closed he asks why we still hcivG eamea forces at Basiciu® 9. With all deference I submit that interminable delays have weakened our position and finally brought us to the verge of that serious quarrel which I understand both His majesty’s Government and Government of India are anxious to avoid. (? Poor) as I realize the suggestions in my telegram Ho.J223_must be, I see in them our only hope of retrieving situation, and this only if they are adopted at once.

I at once went to see Acting Minister for Foreign Aifairs and told him I could not accept note. He had chosen surest way oi destroying all hope of success of my efforts with His Majesty’s Government 0 2 ° Sepabhodi who was then joined by head of English section said that ii he took note back he must tell the Shah and he would certainly be sent to prison. The Shah had been quite unapproachable since British press announcement. He had had Feroughi dragged from his presence yesterday cursing him publicly as a silly old fool who had at his age been tricked by me. Feroughi had been in tears all last night but he did not blame me personally and continued indeed to express regard for me. Sepabhodi himself had, I gathered, just avoided being kicked. The Shah had, however, made the following remarks to Sepabhodi which he repeated to me in strictest confidence and which aro of remarkable interest, namely, that he had all along con sidered it wrong of Persian Navy to haul down our flag and had punished Persian Senior Naval Officer (Sepabhodi said&gt; I ■1 2 . 'Yes: indeed he has'): that Persian naval oiiicers were all youn^ c^nd ignorant and nr .gw nothing either about ships or geography of the Persian Gulf and that he could not understand how a great Navy like the British with its fine tradition.of comradeship should wish to carry on feud with weak and new Persian Navy who had special orders to cultivate our friendship. 3. Sepahhodi said the Shah was especially annoyed at the idea conveyed in British press that I had delivered formal written protest and that the Persian Government had v apologised. I quoted your telegram No. 153 and accused Persian Charg&lt;§ d*Affaires in London of having probably invented the word 'apologise'. I also spoke in the sense of paragraph 3 of that telegram. This cheered Sepabhodi who said he would try to explain to the Shah, who hov/ever generally would not allow anyone to speak a word of explanation to him. Sepabhodi begged me with tears in his eyes to persuade you to remove troops from Basidu. I repeated that we had perfect right to keep them and had in the past always had troops there. He mentioned status quo. I said troops were there in 1930 even after first decision about status quo. He nevertheless begged that we return to status quo of two months ago and that we get something put in the press to correct false idea about protest, apology, and British territory which, would be telegraphed out here and thus calm the Shah. If we could do this we might yet save Peroughi. If not he was.as our friend really alarmed at the golden opportunity which Karakhan who is due in five days would have of fishing in troubled waters. 4. We then returned to question of note. He admitted ...Eul—iotecl tnat he v/as not sur' 0 '”i ^ , , , -Uxp.ised a. my resentment but we a_1 01 U8 t0 taV:e int0 ^count Shah's personality Could I not keep note in my pocket „ f+ v poc ‘'- eu a xew days till the Bhah had cooled down and then when or-icH a ,„ or , v - ibj:i was over quietly return it as 'non avenue' 0 (?5 ^ At risk of y° ur disapproval I decided to do this as I am convinced we can still restore situation officially provided you will scree to suggestions in my uelemram no, J319. It will, however, also be necessary for me to state orally that detachment at Basidu is onlv there temporarily and will very shortly be leaving in normal course of duty though, of course, we retained the right to land again if we wish.

He had outlined to His Majesty his idea of possible satisfactory solution, I imagine somewhat on the lines sketched above, ana the Shah will then take back note as 'non avenue'. .u.is shows that furious as he is he realises he went too -ar in ordering the note.

Confidential &lt;, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs Sepabhodi asked me to visit Mm this morning. He had jast come from the Palace and at once took me to the Prime Minister. EMle on our way he hegged me to 'save His Highness' who was in a terrible predicament# 2- Feroughigreeted me with 'this is a nice position ■in which you have put me'. He said ths Shah was furious with him over what had appeared in the British press and intonated that unless I could quickly help him to save his lace he would probably be dismissed. He had all along given ms the fullest assurances about Basidu and did not His Majesty s Government believe him even when he put these asctiranoes into writing? How could he have done more? .n hinted that note might have contained more adequate expressions of regret but as he repeated that he had acted both rapidly and in all good faith and that in any case Basidu incident was now closed i could not decently continue bo argue this point e specially in the absence of any indication °f the views of His Majesty's Government* c* a then, once more, went over the whole catalogue of misneeas of the Persian Davy# I said that I knew His Highness wasI was not to blame but that did not alter the fact that Basidu trouble was all the Persians'fault. Sven if His Highness had answered my notes and acted on my requests about Koweit dhows it might have helped to convince His majesty's Government of Persia's good intentions. (Sepabhodi seemed to take special note of this point). 4. As for the press notice, I imagined that His Majesty’s Government found, exaggerated rumours were spreading and thought British official wireless 'best means of contradicting them and reducing incident to its proper proportions. (Your telegram No.155 was only received after). Words 'apology' and 'British possession' to which His Highness took special objection were absent from the text as I had received it. (I produced a copy out of my pocket). Words 'regret' and 'British occupation' had been used and I challenged His Highness as to whether they were not correct. He said he had certainly expressed to me his regret several times but he disliked state ment that his assurances were in response to a 'protest by His rajesty’s Government'. A protest implied a note but there had merely been representation. Why could we not have drafted together a communique for the press if a communique was really required? This would have been the proper course now that incident was closed. 5. As for Basidu His Highness could not admit that it was not Persian territory but both he and Sepabhodi in chorus declared that it was of course a British concession (not possession) and that His Majesty's Government had certain rights there as was admitted in Teymourtache’s draft treaty article. 6our ret I failed iiagines ^eriuaenr,n 5. 6 a leroughi then said th-^t qv, u the Shah upset at all our recent activities at Basidu- w- iau&gt; we were said to he cons truetinp' new Tmi i rH-nn-r. , new buildings there; we had left a garrison there for several weeks Thr- 8 , . v T There was a Significant pnuse which I assumed to imply nresenop nf ■p- iiy P resence of First Flotilla but no menaon was actually made of it. 7 ‘ 1 Sald 1 C ° Uld hardl y ^lieve we were doing any serious building at Basidu. Feroughi implored me to let him know this definitely as it would help him with the Snah. He hoped we were not even doing repairs. i sa id I failed to see how it concerned Persia if we were. He said if wnen we make treaty you are going to hand over Basid why spend money on buildings there? (Evidently Shah think that we intend to go back on this clause of draft treaty and imagines we are fortifying Basidu). 8 . Sepabhodi tentatively suggested another help toward! aving (. face) would be for us to remove garrison now at Basidu. I said that if I asked for that as from the Persia: Government reply would probably be exact reverse of what was hoped, this stopped him dead. 9- Feroughi then returned to the question of 'how are you going to repair the situation?' I said the situation had beer broken by the Persian navy and that any reparation was due from that quarter and not from us. But he again tol: me that unless we could help him he was done for and Sepabhodi as well. 'Are we friends' he asked. I answered yes'. 'Then,' said he, 'we must not risk upsetting the hah and spoil hitherto wonderfully favourable atmosphere for negotiation'. He quoted the Shah's message to the King aid SepaWiodi4o ► Sepabliodi quoted what you said to him at the Foreign Office. I expressed fear that recent events might he makinr s ome people in London wonder whether a treaty was worth anything when Persian navy remained free to misbehave itself 0 F.eroughi was shocked. He had given me his word again and again: he was certain treaty could be put through rapidly and that it would be kepi,. Surely His Majesty's Government were animated by friends nip and the bad old days of Lord Curzon were not going to return 0 10 o Finally he begged me to try to induce you to put some further communique in the press which would by implication at least indicate that apology had not been required of Persian Government and that Easidu was not claimed by us as a 'British possession'» Such communique telegraphed here by Reuter or official wireless could be used by him to save himself from the Shahds wrath® I have since the interview drafted a formula (see my immediately succeeding telegram) which mig;ht do® I did not of course in any way commit you but only promised Feroughi to report to you faithfully all he had said, 11® Atmosphere of interview was funereal and I felt sorry for Prime Minister who has throughout bahaved like a gentleman.

My dear Moore, As arranged over the telephone this morning, I write to explain our difficultIts in accepting the insertion, in the draft telegram to Tehran about Baaldu, which was proposed in the admiralty redraft enclosed in deal's letter of September 20 th to me, and to suggest an alternative version. For convenience of reference I enclose (Annex l; a copy of your original draft of the suggested insertion, and (annex 2 ) of the alternative draft# which wg now propose. 2. our main object! chi to your original draft in thfit, while professing merely to describe a Persian assurance, it actually reads more into the assurance given by /©rough 1 than his assurance in fiCt contained* e feel strongly that, if we are to • * • iptain H.K. Moore, 0.3*0. Plans Division, Naval Staff, AW. IHAhTY. Uu.to recapitulate Feroughi's assurances, we must do so accurately and not attempt to twist them to suit our own wishes. If we attempt to read my more into them than they actually state we may well greatly increase the risk of the Fersiaas repudiating the assurances altogether* 3* The next 00 int that arises is ou the question whether tills additional statement to- the Persians is to be made orally, or to form part of Mailet 1 a proposed note* our original reading of your draft was that it was intended that this part of the zammnlcmtlm should be made orally, md 1 feel sure that Mallet would so have interpreted it* You now tell me, however, that the First Lord feels very strongly that this part of the coraaun lost ion should be incorporated in writing in Mallet's note* This makes the matter more delicate, since it is by no means easy to Introduce into a note, the object of which is to close an incident on the Persies coast, a passage dealing with Persian activities * * *think * • * % activities against irab snipping on the High ^eas. There is no doubt a general connexion between all the activities of the Persian havy, and Mallet has ■ji course hinge If suggested, in his telegram ho»3ui, va general reference to these activities; but, if we give too much prominence to this general question In a note the main purpose of which is to close the Basidu incident # we may well fall between two stools, and merely fail to secure a settlement at vsiciu without briuginf a settlement of the major question my nearer* 4* On the other hand, we quite realise your anxiety to say something to malce it clear that we are accepting the present settlement largely on the understanding that a serious effort will be made to reduce the risk of incidents occurring in future; and, this being so, we are prepared to agree to the inclusion in Mallet* s proposed note of a passage on the lines suggested by the admiralty, if the difficulties indicated above cm be avoided* 1 now enclose (Annex 2} a redraft which ah maid Ii A J^icrs^C'T/ point#s wlijLo&amp; X understand the admiralty wish to make, a. I ought perhaps to explain that the second sentence in our redraft (*as the Persian Goverrsoent will realise in the past*), has been in sex ted with a view to render in^ niore plausible our assumpticsn that # although Peroughi never specifically mentioned the point, instruction have already been issued to the Persian havy regarding the treateent of dhows. M want in fact to hint that, when once the whole Question of the behaviour of the Persian havy had oeen brought to their notice, the Persian Govenament must automatic* ally have seen to it that their ships no longer rrained in ignoraiice of the international practice The phrase * where no special treaty arrangements exist between the states concenied* seems to us necessary in order to cover the position of our own ships, which are still theoretically entitled to search, on the Biga Peas, not only Arab, but also ««•tlso Persian vessels* 6. As I explained over the telephone, the India Office have now agreed to tile complete omission of the three paragraphs in our original draft dealing with the question of the proposed earning, and, as this somewhat alters the balance ol the telegram.

(b) the question of a warning. Colonel Fowle had originally been in favour of a warning and the admiralty had originally been in favour of shepherding. The matter was discussed at great length yesterday. On the whole, while the arguments are evenly balanced^ we were left with the feeling that the balance of advantage was rather against including any warning for the reasons given in paragraph 6 of the Foreign Office draft, colonel Fowle, in the light of the discussion, is now opposed to asking . 10r a warnlns ror tilose reasons.

Firstly. In spite of notification to the Persian Government in your telegram of September 9th, 195, to (? Foreign Office) and Governor ol Bushire's statement coinamicated in Bushire telegrem of September 14th, (? 121), Deputy Governor of Henjam states that he has had no instructions and has ordered quarantine Medical Officer not to giv4 pratique to (? omission Secondly. It is impossible to accept treatment of this kind for destroyer flotilla at the outset of her (sio) cruise m the Persian Gulf. Moreover, oompleting with oil and granting shore leave cannot be deferred. Senior Naval Officer has, therefore,' assured himself of clean bill of health of the flotilla aud has handed bills of health to the Deputy Governor with verbal intimation that, as it is known that Tehran and Buefaire have issued instructions, pratique has been assumed. Thirdly. I concur with this action in view of the adverse effect that holding up the flotilla would have on the ■weal people. (Incidentally Sheikh Dabai is hare shooting and watching the flotilla comirg in from H.M.S. Shoreham.): 5) Please see Mr. aaiiet's three telegrams at •flag J, .and Col. Loch’s telegram of 15th Sept, at P.Z. 5819. The F.Q. do not know the cause of the Persian Govt.'s resignation. The F.O. vie?/ is that Mr. Mallet should not return the note as unacceptable as, owing to the resignation of the Persian Govt., this would lead to long delay probably, but should send a note in reply which would make the last sentence of Feroughi's note a peg for filling out the gaps in the Persian note and stating that we understand it as covering these. After Mr. Croft had been in telephone d.o. letter on the file to the F.O. The F.O. are submitting the papers to Sir J. Simon, who is m Scotland, and therefore cannot take action before Monday. The Admiralty views are contained in their official/Oj.xj.cial letter of 15th Sept., now received. It will be seen that the divergence of view is so great that it may be necessary to refer the matter again to Ministers. I have discussed the position with Col. Fowle, and he has given me a note of his views of the action tojoe taken (if the Admiralty proposal to refuse the note iS/adopted). It will be seen that Col. Fowle agrees that Mr. Mallet’s reply to the Persian note should fill out the gaps in it. Then, if the Persians attempt to contradict what we have said in our circular to the Arabs, our note, as well as theirs, can be published, in order to corroborate our circular. Unless, however, the Persians publish their note in order to contradict or minimise our circular, there will be little point in our publishing the gist of the notes to the Arabs, as the Persian note% will give us no satisfaction beyond the oral assurances of which we have already informed the Arabs, and in these circumstances a second circular would tend only to weaken the effect of the and/and possible to rehabilitate our prestige). A possible disadvantage of insisting on the Persian Govt, acknowledging our note may be that it would give them an opening for further argument. It may, therefore, be best that our note should merely contain a statement that we assume that the Persian Govt agree with our interpretation of their first note. It will be desirable that our note should contain some sort of warning to the Persian Govt. The exact content of this warning would be a matter for discussion with the Admiralty and F.O. If they agree, it might be to the effect that if further complaints of the Persian Navy are received, we shall have to consider most seriously strengthening our naval forces (we need not necessarily say permanently) in the Persian Gulf, and giving them strict injunctions to take all legitimate steps for the protection of British and Arab shipping. If, however, the Admiralty (on account of the financial commitment involved) do not like to go so far as this, the warning might be to the effect that we shall have to consider further measures for the protection of British and Arab shipping by every legitimate/5*,,^ Sh eLMU A*n tL.. ^u] legitimate means. Mr. Croft suggests, and I agree, that any warning to the Persians which may be decided on should be broadcast to the A rabs (irrespective of the question whether or not the full con+pn+a +1 contents of the exchange of notes is circulated to them). Our note to the Persians mi#it also contain some hint that facilities for their Navy from us depend on good behaviour (if W e are sufficiently satisfied that they will in fact require such facilities). /V. /&gt;3/ (iiy iwr.

I rather anticipated that this would be so, which was one of the reasons why I suggestea in my note to you of the 4th tnat we would ao well to circularise the main facts of the incident (that the flag haa been rehoisted by the lanaing of an armed party) throughout the Arab Ineikhaoms as quickly as possible. This has now been done, with an addition to the effect that the Persian government have orally expressed regret that the incident had happened, etc.2 ^ Girc ^lar issued to the Arab Sheikhs is being broadcasted throughout these areas in the widest possible manner, a point to which you will remember I personally attach considerable importance, I think in regard to Arab opinion in the Gulf (which is what I am chiefly concerned about) we have done what we can to retrieve the situation^and from thafe* point of view it seems to me that the Persian Note becomes of somewhat secondary importance. At the same time I have the following suggestions to offer;- (a) I concur vide (1) of your d.o. that lallet in his reply to the Persian Government should a.ill in Hie gaps in the fullest possible manner. Indeed, 1 think it would be as well for his reply to embody what we said in our Arab Circular re the Persian Government expressing verbal regret and so forth. y/nen our Circular gets round to the Persian Government they may try to minimise it by publishing their Note. I do not think that this is likely, but in case they uo so we should be prepared to publish our reply. (b)/3 cssp (b) 'With regard to (2) of your a.o. If we insist on obtaining a Note from the Persian Minister of foreign Affairs acknowledging Pallet's Note in reply to his first Note, it is possible that the Persian Government may try to whittle down the statements in our Note with regard to their verbal expressions of regret, etc. (c) with regard to whether the Arab Shaikhs should be informed of the gist of the Notes ((3) of your d.o.). personally I am not inclined to favour this - except in utie circumstances set forth above in (a). The Persian ^ote is inadequate in itself, its communication would not add anything to the effect of our circular, and might detract something from it. (d) With regard to the points raised in (4) of your d.o., I think that toilet should end up his Note with some sort of warning to the Persian Government of what we will uo if further complaints are received of actions of the Persian Navy. How this warning should be worded might be a matter for further aiscussion at the interdepartmental meeting which I understand is to take place shortly. (e)/(q) I din no 't QuiljQ clssir wliot/iior 'tliQ Pops inn Navy now require docking facilities from us at Bombay or not. There was some question of it at one time. If they still require these facilities, then a hint might he conveyed to the Persian Government that these facilities depend on the future good behaviour of their Navy. ^6 t 3 3 “r e. ^—crurth■V M.02678/33. sir. 1933 J t am commenaea My Lords commlBBloners of the Admiralty to Inform you that fheir Lordships had under consideration telegram Ho.lWB) from the Charge a*Affaire© in Tehran reporting the text of the note addreased to him by the Persian Government * concerning the Basidu incident. Their Lordships are unable to regard this note ae adequate reparation for an incident in which the British flag was deliberately torn down by the Senior Officer of the Persian Havy. This being so they are of the opinion that a settlement, such as that suggested by Mr. Mallett, based on this note would not be satisfactory. My Lords are strengthened in this view by the tele gran dated 15th September which has just been received from the Acting Political -Resident in the Persian Gulf, and They suggest that Mr. Mallett should be instructed to refuse this note and to ask for an apology more in keeping with the gravity of the offence.

(4) Sir Samel iioare is not in favour of Loch's suggestion that we should inform the Persian Government that British warships will shepherd each Fersirsn ship, lie thinks this too specific; but he thinks very strongly that Mallet should end up his Note with some sort of warning to the Persians of what we shall do if complaints of the actions of the Persian Kavy continue. Perhaps, for example, he might say that if tnese complaints continue to be received, we shall have to consider most seriously the stationing of further naval forces permanently in the Persian mif, with definite instructions to take all legitimate steps for the protection of British and arab shipping.

Begins - In the course of recent interviews you have expressed anxiety concerning certain events which have recently taken place in the Persian Gulf* In spite of the fact that I was aware of the good intentions of Imperial Government and that I had assured you on that point I made enquiries from the proper quarter and find that these actions were not based on any specific instructions. For this reason instructions have been issued to acting Commander of Southern Navy that he is to apply for instructions to his headquarters in special questions which may arise and which have tB. international bearing. He has also been reminded that since it is necessary that in future navy of Imperial Government should co-operate with the British navy in the Persian Gulf, policy of Imperial Government is that complete friendship and sincerity should exist between the navy of His Britannic Majesty's Govern ment and that of the imperial Government. In view of this I am very happy to be able to confirm what I already informed you by word of mouth* Ends o Please2 e Please see my immediately following telegram.

(2) Die question was, what was the way to do this with the maximum possible effect, but at the same time with the least possible delay? (3) Visible ceremonial reparation would obviously have the best effect. Unfortunately, however, one could not gainsay toilet* s opinion that the Persians ble Lieutenant Colonel p.g. Loch. would/- 2 - .iould never voluntarily agree to this. (4) It was agreed that there was no way of foreIne; Persia to a ceremony. (5) wallet aavised that if we aecanaed a cereaony we aieht gat nothing at all - not even a satisfactory written note of apology. (6) Fowls ala not think that the idea of shadowing Persian ships would he at all useful from the point of view of restoring our prestige in Arab eyes. (7) Oui primary aegiaeratum of restoring prestige as soon as possiole therefore seemed to require that we should make immediate use of the oral regrets, etc., of the Persian Government, ana then go all out for a satisfactory Note from them, rather than make aemanas with which there seemed no prospect of their complying, am which at the best would have meant prolonged delay In the initial circular stating the facts of the case we had, of course, to make sure that we cynfined ourselves to incontrovertible facts, the truth of which could not be challenged by the Persian government afterwards. It was thought quite safe to/to incluae In the statement of facts references in general terms to the Persian Government's oral regrets, disavowals, etc., but it was thought that it woula be going too far to make any reference to disciplinary action unless and until we can get some mention of this in the written Note from Persia.private and Personal. INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, 3.W. 1. &gt;L September 1933. Tbe Baslau case Las been a most dllficult one lor all concerned, on account of tne gravity oT tiie incident itself ana the diametrical opposition of view between the Foreign Office ana the Admiralty, we are very grateful for the help which you have j;iven us throughout the correspondence on the subject during the last month, and which was of very material assistance to the secretary of State in presenting the case to the Cabinet. The decision taken regarding trie circularising oi the Arab Eulers is more or less on the lines of your telegram of 27th August, in which you proposed that Information should be at once given to the Eulers regarding the facts of the case ana the oral regrets already expressed by the Persian Government. The chief difference is that it was decided that a circular should n ble Lieutenant Colonel p.G. Loch. Fhe Residency, Bushire. be/be sent in writing. The Cabinet decision was not over clear as to the details to be included in this initial circular, but left discretion to the Departments. Mien these were discussed at a subsequent interdepartmental meeting, the AdBiiialty representatives dia not take any exception to the proposal to include the reference to non-interference with British naval arrangements ana collaboration with H.m.'s ships. But we quite agree here, in the light of your telegram of 8th September, that it would be better to omit this reference, and a telegram *6 1 agreeing to its omission. I hope you have not been pulled out often by all this most immediate telegraphing, and I am afraid that the decision imposes rather a heavy job on the Political Agents. I was not quite clear myself how ihe Initial circular is to be distributed along toe Irucial Coast, in any case, we were sure that whatever arrangements you made would be the best possible, jmd3 - I gather from the fact that you are on your way to the Xruclal Coast (your telegram of 11th September) that you are taking it yourself. As Fowle came up to London last Saturday, and the case was coming up in the Cabinet on Tuesday, r took the occasion to consult him informally on the whole question, so that the Secretary of state might not miss the opportunity thus offered of obtaining his views. He was good enough to record the note of which he authorises me to send you a copy. You will see that he strongly took the view, as you have done, that the essential immediate step was to circulate information as to the facts of the case among the Arabs.

Our dealings with the ’ersians in sane of the Gulf Forts (usually with very minor officials such as Deouty Governor, Health Officers, Customs Officials etc.) far removed from ^ehran and viewed from the 'other end of the telescope ', give us a contrary impression. 3. For instance, at Henjam it is known that the uetty officials dare not appear friendly lest they should be renorted by the others to hi^ier authority. It is notice able that after the recent visit of the Governorof the Gulf Forts, aggravating and totally unnecessaary incidents have had recrudescence, as the attached extract from the 'BITVSiDPD'S' latest Report of Proceedings will show. 4. Again at Basidu, there is only me petty official, who only cones in contact with us when he crosses the border and has heen cautioned to avoid British Basidu by His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief. H e has informed me personally that he re-oorts every incident to his superiors and that they concur in his action. It wouldseera he is definitely encouraged, '^en again there was the recent visit to British Basidu by the Governor of the Forts which may, or may not, he connected with the latest outrage against the British flag. 5. At Abadan, where there is scope fbr friction on a wider scale owing to the greater number of people con cerned, similar views to ours are held by Port Officials and others. ’Whether these views are shared by the A«P.O.C. personnel I do not know. They are a more or less self- contained community and the Company has wisely taken steps to reduce the possibility of friction. 6. Enclosure No.2 contains a few extracts from some rough notes hurriedly jotted down during a few hours stay at Abadan. They are, admittedly, very incomplete and sketchy and were intended for no use other than a personal reminder for future enquiries I intended to make when time permitted during a longer stay.

The Q..M.O. apparently considered that he ought to have been given the job and has ever since been engaged in a campaign of unpleasantness against the ^elegraphs Doctor. 4. He has now demanded the Goanese Doctor’s credentials and testimonials. These were sent to Tehran last September in accordance with the usual procedure before a Hon-Persian Doctor is allowed to practice in Persia. These have not been returned . 5. The Q.MP. is trying to stop the Telegraphs Doctor from practising in Hen jam at all, even going so far as to say he is not to treat the Persian employees of the Telegrams Co. 6. There is yet another Nazimieh arrived here and the Q.M.O. has persuaded him to back him (the Q.M.O.) up. The situation is a difficult one. 7. Mr. Harding has represented the matter to his head office in Karachi, but as far as I know the Political Authorities at Eushire are not aware of the situation. 8. It is also reported that the Q,.M.O. has lately been holding up the slow mails for as long as 40 minutes before giving them pratique. He has compelled the Captain and all the Officers to parade on front of him. 1ft.9. The men who were arrested as being concerned in the attack on Mr.Morton (vide my letter Ho.S.66 of 8th June 1933) and who were to have been sent to Bandar Abbas for trial, have been let out *on bail' and are now at large in Henjam. One of them is anployed by the new Nazimieh. (Signed) E.C. Deni son Captain.Enclosure Ho.2 to the Senior Naval Officer’s Persian Oulf Pi vision, letter N 0 .33/423 to the Honours!.

It was too rou^i to land and she sailed without anchoring. Lingeh is only 20 miles from Basidu. One ship of a class Is sometimes taken for another by the natives. Also, the Captain of the 'BABR* might have been a passenger onboard 'PAIANG' which would account for the statement of a sailor to Ali bin Moharaed.

Also the fact that he hesitated to go the A. .O.C. Camp to report the Incident supports this nelief. 6. A perusal of the rough summary of witnesses* statements show that a party of seven besides sailors landed from the ship about an hour before sunset. According to a reported statement of a sailor, this party included an Italian and a frenchman, also the Captain of the 'BASH*. The four others (referred to in paragraph 5 above) proceeded on landing towards the mast and after hauling down the flag, walked first towards Hassan*3 Tomb then towards the revellers * or Hest House(known to us as the Guard House), in which vicinity they remained a short time inspecting the British Cemetery, and the Khodadad Memorial. They then returned to the landing place and thw whole partv embarked shortly after sunset while it was still light. The party were unarmed except for a sporting gun. As none of the witnesses carried watches, they estimated their times by the position of the sun. When examining +he ground and the position from which he had seen the occurrence, the boy Mohamed bin Mahmood, pointing to the sun, said H It was about this time*, roughly half an hour before sunset.

It is significant that, although he was present with the Officers when the Mudir was there. All did ndt hear the Officers give instructions to the Mudir and did not appear to know that such instructions had been given to the coolie. Ambar bin Ferooz also saw the Mudir of Customs in conversation with the Officers for five or six minutes. 10. A large number of people have been interviewed but delay in arriving at a conclusion was caused by difficulty in obtaining sufficient reliable witnesses owing to fear of the Persians. When they landed, the natives, as one of the witnesses expressed it, kept away because they were afraid of being arrested or beaten. 1 have just found another wi+ness who states that he saw the four officers at the flagstaff and actually saw them haul down the flag. I will include his evidence* if there is time to do so before catching the mail which I hope to intercept to-day at Lingeh, but do not propose to delay this letter for it as there is already sufficient evidence to establish the fact. 11.

First destroyer flotilla consisting of leader and eight destroyers of most modem type sailed from Eastern Mediterranean on the night of 5th September and will roach llenjan about the 15th September. Press statement has been issued that flotilla is on oruise to Men. Denial is ooing issued to Press report that flotilla is boing sent in connection with trouble between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, and you should deny this report if it is repeated at Men. The flotilla is due at Men on the ICth September by which date a further announcement will have to be made as to its destination. In royly to enquiries the Proas ho re have boon informed confidentially that the flotilla will probably 'i proceed from Men to shew flag on the Arab shore ox the Persian Gulf.

The Cabinet agreed that the facts of the situation, as set out in the F.O. memo., should be brought home to the Sheikhs, and that the details of the action to be taken should oe concerted between the depts concerned. The interdepartmental conference of yesterday, at which Col.

September 19537 — L - 3. The Cabinet had under consideration a Bote by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.20o(33)) , covering a Memorandum by the Foreign Office and a Memorandum by the First Lord 0 1 ^ ie Admiralty (C . P. 214 (33)) regarding the incident on July 31st at Basidu (a Naval station on an island in the Persian Gulf) where the British flag, which was untended at the time, had been hauled down by Persian naval officers. As a result of semi-official representations by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran (made pending the receipt of official instructions),the Persian Government had issued categorical orders to their Navy to avoid a.ll interference with British Naval arrangements, had administered 9 severe reproof to the Commander of the Persian Fleet (who had himself been one of the officers concerned), had spontaneously expressed their regret and had offered to examine any other complaints which we might have against the Persian Navy. The question for decision by the Cabinetffrti 2 . was how far it was desirable to go in demanding from Persia additional visible reparation for the incident. The First Lord of the Admiralty urged in his Memorandum that it was essential to rehabilitate our position by insisting on visible reparation such as the rehoisting of the flag by Persians at Basidu, in the presence of British warships. The First Lord suggested that a flotilla of destroyers should be ordered at once to the Persian Gulf in order to impress the Persians with the fa.ct that we were in earnest in our demand for reparation. This Naval demonstration would not in itself imply any forcible step. On the other hand, the Foreign Office Memorandum gave reasons in support of the view that the additional advantages to be gained by the attempt to secure such a ceremony would be incommensurate with the risks incurred. The demand would probably be regarded as an intolerable humiliation by the Shah, and there was a strong likelihood of it being rejected. Any attempt to enforce compliance would mean a serious crisis in Anglo-Persian relations, with many repercussions e.g., on the Henjam question. The view of the Foreign Office was that the amends already made might be accepted as sufficient, if accompanied by a written recapitulation (to be circulated to the3 . principal Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf) of the nature of the apologies made and instructions issued by the Persian Government. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGE AFFAIRS thought it important to mention that after the flag had been hauled down on the 31st July, a sloop had proceeded to Basidu. The sloop had appeared on the scene and on August 5th the flag had been rehoisted and an armed guard posted. The British flag was, therefore, now flying at Basidu. He suggested that the Kavy might find means of giving seme of the Sheikhs ocular proof of this. THE HIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed out that the Foreign Office view appeared to be based on the assumption that the hauling down of the flag at Basidu had been a mistake. I T o action, however, could be taken which was better calculated to lower British prestige in the Gulf. 'oreover, the action was consistent with the pin-pricks which the Persian Government had been administering to us for a long time past. Hitherto we had only reacted when the question turned on oil. If the episode at Basidu were a deliberate insult, the Persians would say that we only turned round when they attacked us in the oilfields. He quoted a telegram just received fromthe Naval Commander-in-Chief to the effect that a Persian emissary had approached the Sheik of Ras-el-Kheimar urging him to transfer his allegiance to Persia, and making the most bf the Basidu incident. This was part of an extensive propaganda along the Trucial coast. He agreed that it was difficult to enforce the action he proposed on Persia. The only weapon was the Treaty and he did not know whether this was more important to Persia or ourselves. He recalled our long traditions in the Gulf, which were threatened. TH.iii SB^R&amp;TARi OP BTA.TE FOR INDIA said that this a i eally serious incioent. The hauling down of the flag had ceen carried out by the Senior Naval Officer of the Persian Fleet who was a responsible person. We had held the Basidu concession for more than one hundred years and had received it not from Persia but from the Imam of Muskat. It was another episode in the long series of attacks on our prestige in the Gulf. Realising this, his Department had got into touch with the Acting Resident in the Gulf, the Resident, who was at present on leave, and the Government of India,. The result was to show that what was needed above all was prompt action to show the Sheiks that we were not abandoning our position in the Gulf. He himself would have preferred a demonstration in which the Persian Navy was compelledT 5 to take part. He thought, however, that it would be very difficult to compel the Persians to adopt this course and, at any rate, it would take a very long time. Delay was dangerous. In the circumstances, he was forced to the conclusion that the plan of compelling the Persians to take part in a ceremony must be abandoned, and that we must fall back on the plan of getting tne Sheiks to rea.lise the actual position. He suggested that to get an apology was not sufficient. We ought at once to send in writing a circular to the Sheiks saying that the Union Jack had been rehoisted anc an apology oiiered oy the Persians. We should then get an apology in writing and send a coov to eaoh of the Sheik not differ in principle from the Secretary of State for India, but expressed doubt as to whether it was advisable to take action in two stages. THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the danger of delay might be avoided by informing the Sheikhs that we had sent a landing party and that the flag w r as now flying. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER suggested the advisability of sending some warships to the Gulf.6. THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said this course had been criticised on the ground that though the first impression would be favourable the Arabs would expect some drastic action and when it did not take place the result would he had. THE PRIKE MINISTER felt doubts as to mentioning an apology in the first announcement. The Cabinet were reminded, however, that Mr.Mallett had expressed the view that the Persian Foreign Minister’s statement would justify an announcement. THE SECRETARY CF STATE FOR BCMIYION AFFAIRS emphasised the danger of Persia subsequently repudiating their apology. The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the Persian Foreign Minister had actually repudiated the action of the Persian Senior Naval Officer. THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the statements made by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Teheran, as set forth in Paragraph 3 of C.P. 206(33) might be communicated at once to the Sheikhs. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggested that in this event the information should be taken to the Sheikhs by a destroyer flotilla which was now lying off the Palestine coast ready to start at once for the■ &gt; 1 7. Persian Gulf. The appearance of this flotilla he tnought was calculated to impress the Sheikhs. THh SEC PET ARY OF STATE FOR IEDIA suggested that information of the Cabinet's intentions should be telegraphed first to our Minister at Teheran and to the Acting Resident in the Gulf, who would no doubt send their comments. The Cabinet agreed:- (a) That the proposa.l to insist upon reparation by the Persian Navy in ceremonial form should not be adopted, owing to the great difficulties that would be met in inducing the Persian Government to consent and to the delay involved in a metter in which prompt action was necessary. (b/ That short of the proposal in (a) the most drastic action should be taken in order to bring home to the Sheikhs on the Trucial Coast the facts of the situati on as set forth in C.P.206(33), as well as the fact that the Union Jack was rehoisted at Basidu a few r days after it has been hauled down and is still flying there. should be concerted between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for India, and the First Lord of the Admiralty, with an overriding instruction frcm the Cabinet that immediate action is to be taken. Admiralty should be authorised to order a flotilla of destroyers no-w on the Palestine coast to proceed to the Persian Gulf.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l, 6th September, 1955.

This circular should include a statement of the facts of the case in regard to the incident, but also (it was thought, in view of the Cabinet minutes) a statement in general terms of the oral assurances given by the Persian Govt., their disavowal of the incident, etc. A draft telegram to the G. of I., repeated to the Pol.

We cannot make any reference to disciplinary action in the first circular, which is to be issued immediately, pending receipt of the Persian Bote. But I Mr. Mallet said in his telegram of 30th Aug. that he would try to get a mention of the Shah’s reproof to Major Bayendor in the Persian Note, and if he succeeo.s, this will be included m the second circulari to be issued.

The Question of legal status turns on the question whether the Imam, in making his grant, was acting as sovereign of Kishm or as tenant from Persia. There seems to be little doubt that he was not sovereign, but only tenant, and that consequently a claim to the concession at Basidu could not be maintained if Persia should desire to resume it (though the fact that we have occupied it since 1822 without protest from Persia constitutes a strong moral claim against arbitrary eviction, and, of course, puts Persia more than ever in the wrong in regard to her recent action). Until recently no doubt was felt in any quarter that the Imam of Muscat was merely a tenant when he granted the concession, and that consequently we cannot hold it against Persia’s will. Quite recently it has been suggested (by the Tehran Legation in the first/first* instance) tliat our claiin to Basidu rnay be stronger than was thought* In particular, a telegraph agreement between H.M.G. and Muscat of 1864 reaffirms the British title to Basidu. There is also a Persian firmap of 1855 which leases Kishm to Muscat, but makes no reference to Basidu. It is possible that this and other Persian acts could be used to show that in the middle of last century Persia tacit l y, acknowledged our title to Basidu. The question of our claim has therefore been re-examined (and the effect of the various documents is still under examination). But at the best the new examination appears only to increase the value of Basidu as a bargaining counter, and not to give us any sure title on which we could face the League. I have spoken to-day to Col. Fowle on this point, and his opinion is that the documents which have been under recent consideration merely increase the nuisance value of our claim to Basidu.T \ Y'.o U nute Paper. ^ ^ ^Department.

Laithwaite's notes flagged A and B bring the story down to 30th August. / t t lJ$\ ' L/&lt;m^ [ XrvjAc . // /^ ^ iv It will be remembered that it had been suggested (originally by the Pol. Resident) that we should demand a ceremonial reparation, viz., that the Persians should rehoist the flag and give a salute of guns. A lesser form of ceremony was suggested by the F.O. to Mr. Mallet, viz., that the Persians should land a detachment to salute the flag. Mr. Mallet, however, is strongly of opinion not only that the Persians would refuse any sort of ceremony, but that to put forv/ard such a demand even tentatively would land us in a serious C ■' quarrel with Persia. We therefore sent the telegram of 29th August (flag D), informing the Pol. Resident of Mr. Mallet’s views and asking what, in Col. Loch’s view, is the minimum that would meet the requirements of the situation as regards our prestige with the Arabs, and whether it would suffice to announce to them that the Persians r disavowed Major BayendO^’s action, promised safeguards against such occurrences and collaboration with tne British Navy, and that they had apologised and tanen disciplinary action. The Pol. Resident agreed, in his telegram of 31st August (flag E), that this was the only course if visible reparation is ruled out , but he evidently thought it a bad p.is aj-ler. At this point we received the S.N.O.’s telegram ! 0 f 31st August (flagged C), reporting the spread of rumours on the Trucial Coast by Persians that the Persians had hoisted the Persian flag at Basidu, that Gt Britain/Britain was too weak to oppose Persia, etc. On receipt of this, we at once asked the Resident whether he wished to offer any supplementary observations, and the F.O. instructed Mr. Mallet to draw the Persian Govt.'s attentioii to these rumours and press them to take action to counteract them. Mr. Mallet, however (telegram of 1st Sept.) thinks it unwise at Tehran to take any notice of the rumours, and suggests that the proper reply is to conduct a vigorous counter propaganda among the Arabs. On the other hand, Col. Loch naturally finds in these rumours confirmation of the anxiety which he has already expressed of the consequences which may follow failure to obtain visible reparation. Th|e S.M.O.’s views (in the telegram of 4th Sept., just received) are in the same sense, but much more forcible: he thinks that nothing but visible reparation will rehabilitate British prestige in the eyes of the Arabs. ^ ie ^^f u 'S’f the F.O. memo, for the Cabinet is flagged F, and the Admiralty memo. G. Ihe Ciux of the question is our prestige among tne Arabs » not future of the treaty negotiations at Tenran (to which Mr. Mallet and the F.O. attach perhaps ooo much importance); but what is essential in order to restore our prestige with the Arabs is that we should be able to piove to them that we have received some reruxation from Persia, and that we should be aide to do -Blipkiz (more than a month has now elapsed since the incident). Obviously a visible ceremony would be best, i r. Mallet advises that there is no chance whatever of obtaining any ceremony, and has indicated that, if we a s k for it, we may even risk the chance of obtainingV nute Paper. Department. rec «ijt n- ] I a N Co « ITS, tib, Ccj, ftlie iences I. !,ij! la: ( such verbal amends as may otherwise be forthcoming. The only means of enforcing a demand for visible reparation i that has been suggested is reinforcement of the Persian Gulf Squadron and shadowing of the Persian Navy. This might or might not be effective in Arab eyes, but at any rate it would not give us visible reparation by Persia, nor even the expression of disavowal, regret, etc., which we may now obtain. It seems, therefore, better to concentrate on I getting what we can as soon as we can. I have discussed the matter with Col. Fowle, and he has been good enough , to give me the attached note, from which it will be seen that his views coincide mainly with those already tentatively formulated in the 1.0. Col. Fowle, however, thinks that it is of the first importance that we should immediately issae a circular to the Arabs in the sense of (a) and (b) on page 3 of his note. It is of the first importance that we should immediately advertise that we landed an armed par^ and rehoisted the flag. This by itself will gn far to counteracting the rumours. We should do this without waiting to be m a position to say something more to the Arabs, because that may still take some time. Secondly, Col. Fowle thinks that we should wait till we have the Persian Note which hr. mallet dopes to obtain, expressing regret, disavowal, etc. On receipt of this, we should again circularise the Araks m writinn (and not merely orally, as has hitherto been proposed), and in this circular we should go as far as the Persian Note makes possible^/assuming that that Note/ 1712b 5000 3/33Note goes sufficiently far, that we should circulate the statements (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) on page 3. This procedure coincides with what has hitherto been suggested, except l/ 4hat (as Col. Loch also thinks) we t * should wait for the Persian Note before making statements (c) to (g), an/lhat these statements- should be made in writing. The latter point goes somewhat beyond the F.O. proposals, which have hitherto contemplated that the statements to the Arabs should be oral. If the S.of S. approves, he might be disposed to guiae the Cabinet towards acceptance of these proposals and this procedure, viz. Ui^Pol. Resident to be immediately instructed to circulate in writing to the Arab Sheikhs a statement uhat recently the British flag at Basidu was hauled down by a Persian officer, and that oA an anned party was landed by H.M.S.

(3) If a Persian Note is received and satisfactorily covers the above points, this information (or so much as the Persian Note does cover) to be circulated^tT the Arab Sheikhs. Col.

The other complaints against the Persian Nav^ referred to are those mentioned in the attached separate note. /) ^ ^ ^ „ A, sj. ^ ^ n i- &lt;7 h - U, &lt;), ftConfidential. Mr. Walton. I found the Basidu Flag telegranuwaiting for me when I arrived in town yesterday, with your note asking me ix I would go tnough them preparatory to our conversation of tomorrow. I have perused the correspondence carefully, and am of the following opinion, subject to any new light which may be shed on the matter as a result of our conversation. I agree with Mallet that the Persian Government did not either order or instigate the outrage, which was thus the work of Bayendor himself. Bayendor, however, as the Persian Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf, is a highly placed and responsible Persian official, and the Persian Government must in some sort be held responsible for his actions. I agree with Loch as to the unfortunate effect which the outrage will have throughout the Arab States of the Gulf. I will, indeed, go further, and venture to say that it will do us no good either in Iraq (vhere considerable interest is evinced in the Gulf incidents, especially when such incidents are of the nature to lower our prestige/ imprestige, and where presumably, especially at the present moment when the Assyrian question is on the ooard, it is important to keep our stock as high as possible), or in Saudi Arabia. 2. Loch’s original proposals (vide his telegram No.94 of 13th August) were for: (1) A 'ceremonial” reparation by the Persian Go vemment. (2) And/or a dismissal of Bayendor. (3) An apology from the Persian Government. (4) An undertaking from them to prevent a recurrence. 3* While these proposals in themselves are , in my opinion, no more than might be justly demanded, it appears from the summary of conclusions given in India Office telegram of 29th August that circumstances di2i not permit of our making demands (1) and (2). It remains therefore to consider what is the minimum reparation which we should obtain from the Persian Government. 4. Whatever is the exact method by which this 7aac tccC minimum can be expected from the Persian Government, whether/■ 'whether in the form of a note from them or/and by an oral expression of regret from the appropriate Persian official, it is, in my opinion, desirable that we should be in a position to issue a Circular to the Arab Sheikhs of the Gulf in the following sense: (a) That on the 31st July the British Flag at Basidu was hauled down by a Persian officer; (b) That on the 5th August H.M. S # ! Bideford ! landed an armed party which rehoisted the flag which has been flying ever since; (c) That the action of the Persian officer was entirely unauthorised by the Persian Government; (d) That the Persian Government regret that this incident has occurred; (e) That the Persian Government have conveyed their displeasure to the Persian officer concerned; (f) That the Persian Government have given assurances that the flag will not be interfered with; (g) That the Persian Governmentypromised investigation into certain other complaints concerning the interference by the Persian Navy with Arab Dhows. 5. Of these proposals (a) and (b) are of course independent of what the Persian Government may say. It is an important fact that the flag was rehoisted and has been flying since. I agree with Loch (vide his telegram of 31st August) that we should emphasise that/4. that we had. landed an armed party. The other proposals coincide generally with those contained in the India Office telegram of 29th August and are framed with the idea of what it may be practicable to exuract from the Persian Government in the way of a note. It is naturally important that what we say to the Sheikhs and the Persian Government say to us should be the same. (Vide paragraph 2 of F.O.telegram of 29th August and paragraph (b) of Loch’s telegram of 31st August). With regard to (c). The Persian Foreign Office has already stated as much to Mallet (vide latter’s telegram No. 171 of 13th August). With regard to (d). Failing an actual 'apology” from the Persian Government, as suggested in India Office telegram of 29th August, which I doubt will be forthcoming, an expression of regret that the incident had happened would serve our purpose as well for communication to the Sheikhs. This is of course in the nature of a play on words, but the Persians like this sort of thing. WitVWith regard to (e). If the Persian Government state, as they have done, that the action of the Persian officer was taken without their orders, logiciaily (though of course they are far from logical) they should not make difficulties over saying that they are displeased with that officer. (f) and (g). No difficulties. 6. It would be much preferable if these proposals (c) to (g) - (a) and (b) as I have pointed out can be issued without reference to what the Persian Government say - were included in a note from the Persian Government and not merely orally. This is however a point which I would like to discuss with you further. 7. In conclusion it appears to me that the outstanding fact in relation to Arab public opinion, our most important consideration, is that the flag halving been hauled down by the Persians was rehoisted by us with the landing of an armed party and is still flying. It is the circulation of this fact which will, I think, have the most effect on the Arab Sheikhs, though of course the addition of an expression of regret etc. by the Persian Government would be still more/6 \J more efficacious* If, therefore, there is likely to be any more delay in extracting the required statement from the Persian Goverrment, (and from what I know of them this aelay is probable) I suggest for consideration (the same suggestion is made by Loch in his telegram of 27th August, but has a difference in that the communication should be made orally) that a Circular be issued at once to the Arab Sheikhs on the lines of my proposals (a) and (b) in paragraph 4 above. As the incident is now more than a month old the actual dates might be omitted in (b) and the word , ’recently ,, substituted for '31st July' in (a). The Circular might begin with some such introduction as: 'Since foolish and exaggerated rumours have been current in the Persian Gulf with regard to a certain incident in Basidu, the following are the facts'. The widest publicity should be given to this Circular by the Sheikhs concerned, who should broad cast copies throughout their areas. 'Exaggerated rumours' have got a long start of us, and we shall ha.ve to work fast to catch them up.NOTE. ■S.^.y-e.e ...cases of interferen ce of Persians with Koweiti VesslsTiT (1) Koweiti dhow wi th cargo of sugar and groceries properly manifested^ Fao seized in Shatt-el-Arab (almost certainly in Iraq waters) by Persian Customs on 6th December last on suspicion of smuggling; crew of 4 detained for 9 days without food except their own cargo; Captain, a Koweiti subject, still detained without trial as far as known and dhow also detained.

It was carried out by the senior officer of the Persian Navy and can scarcely thereiore be called a mistake. Whether it was originally a mistake or not, the telegrams we have received from the Persian Gulf leave no doubt about its disastrous effect on Arab opinion. Bearing this in mind, I think the disavowals spontaneously offered by the Shah and his promised apol ogy ,, - . T v, „v fv-pfhprmore, that we should V are worthless: I think, j.ur oueimuic, u.±g v. insist upon reparation in ceremonial xox^*, ~ct following reasons. 2. We have to secure two things. The first is our prestige on the Arab shore of the Gulf. For more than 100 years Great Britain has Been the arbiter of the Gulf and it is mainly our prestige which has brought to an end constant strife between Persian and Arab, and between conflicting Arab tribes, and which has rendered possible the virtual suppression of gun-running and the slave trace. • ivr -ppqult of Naval power; and its This prestige is mainly tne res-iu ^ ^o-nprMallv to oriental eyes, is outward and visible sign, especian., the British Flag which has now been msulteu. %. The second, and perhaps more important, occect the rehabilitation of our position in the eyes of Persra. We have, since the war, tried consistently to establish goo relations with Persia by a policy of conciliation. The only -1-results have been an exaggerated feeling of self-importance on the part 01 Persia ? a steady sapping of our oosition in the Gulf 5 and a decline in our prestige which the Political Resident states is u more marked than I could have conceived possible 4 '. I have no great hopes in the possibility of obtaining a satisfactory treaty in this way. The Persian policy is clearly to oust us from our position of arbiter of the Gulf, and I am of the opinion that a tonic is needed to restore our position in Persia and that the present, when the Persians are clearly in the wrong, would be a good moment for it to be administered. 4. I would point out that the action which I recommend has from the beginning been supported by the two responsible authorities actually on the spot, namely, the Naval Comnander-in-Chief and the Political Resident at Bushire. 5. I suggest, therefore, that the Charge d'Affaires be instructed to ash for a ceremony at Basidu to include the rehoisting of the Flag by Persia, in the presence of British warships. Ii this is reiused, I would suggest a strongly v/orded note to Persia pointing out the impossibility of Treaty negotiations whilst the insult remains unatoned; insisting upon our determination in the meanwhile to maintain of course, Henjam; we have maintainv&gt;d an the status quo in the Gulf, including and emphasizing that for a long period attitude of friendship for Persia, but that the an attemp and that recent policy of Persia can only be interpreted as t to undermine the British position in the Gnxi, this makes the continuance of friendly relations impossible. We might go on to point out that British friendship has been in the past of great value to Persia, as witness our steady refusal hitherto to countenance the— ■ —Muscat claim to Henjam, which some might consider better than the Persian, and suggest that the Persian Government should consider well before rejecting our friendship. ^ ae Cabinet approve the action I have suggested above I would propose, if my colleagues agree, to order a Flotilla of destroyers to the Gulf at once, to impress the Persians with the fact that we are in earnest in our demand for reparation. I would not, of course, suggest any forcible step, but only a Naval demonstration accompanied by a close watch on all Persian Naval craft. (Initialled) B.S~M. Admiralty, S.Y/.l. Sept. 1st, 1933.♦ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the Cabinet. September 1933. SECRET O.P. 206 (33). Copy No. ][Q CABINET. I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum on the recent incident at Basidu, in the Persian Gulf. It is a matter of some urgency to decide upon the line now to be taken with the Persian Government. J. S. September 2, 1933. A SERIOUS incident recently occurred at Basidu, a naval “ station in the Persian Gulf where the British flag had been flown without interruption for over a hundred years. The station, a small place on the Persian island of Qishm, is regarded by His Majesty’s Government as a British concession, but notwithstanding the long period of uninterrupted tenure the title of His Majesty’s Government to occupy it is weak. For many years no use has been made of the concession and it has been retained solely as a political pawn for use in treaty negotiations with Persia. 2. The facts of the incident are as follows : On the 31st July four Persian naval officers, amongst them the officer commanding the Persian fleet, landed at Basidu from a gunboat and hauled down the British flag in the presence of several witnesses, including a Frenchman and an Italian. The flag was untended at the time, the caretaker being away. 3. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran that this outrage was committed without the know ledge or sanction of the Persian Government or of the bhah. In rep y o e strong semi-official representations which Mr. Mallet has mace pen ing e receipt by him of instructions as to the demands to ne put forward officially, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated that his Government sincere!} deplore the occurrence of the incident and have now, on the Shah s instruct ons issued categorical orders to the Persian navy to avoid all u ? f 1 .g er ( e r e , &gt; i nn ^ naval arrangements, to collaborate m all possible ways with ^Action stationed in the Gulf, and in future to report for orders before tak ng aOT action “when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind. - Minister for Foreign Affairs has further stated that the ir, of hi, to complaints against the Persian «av 7 ,. tp competent officia e^laming that he had received orders to press forward with the settlement of all such cases. 4 Brieflv then, the Persian Government have, without waiting for an m • i ' ’ r TT-i- yr^ip^tv’s Government, shown a genuine desne to ^ official remonstrance from His Majesty s uo ’ • .p inoidents in make amends and to guard effectually against a repetition of such incidents ^ future. fS Thp Question for decision is how far it is desirable to go m demanding forthelnddenf 'sbe^n‘suggestedJljl/Xvernment should 7019 [8994]demand a ceremony at which a Persian naval detachment should rehoist th British flag and salute it in the presence of British warships. It i s contended that such a ceremony is essential in order to restore British prestige in the eves of the Gulf Arabs. iitrsfc 0. tut if** 6 . Mr. Mallet, who in conversation with the Persian Minister for Forei Affairs has hinted that an offer of visible reparation at Basidu should be ma mvuAvnmpnf, ha.d received a strono- irrmressinn ftiaf o^r Rn iVllfclirs nets c*,xx VXXXV.X — . : onuuiu ue made by the Persian Government, has received a strong impression that any further demands of such a nature would be regarded as an intolerable humiliation by the Shah, whose ungovernable temper is well known and whose power in his own country is completely despotic. Mr. Mallet’s considered view is that an attempt to enforce compliance with such demands (and he would deprecate ’ F ^^ +&gt;ia infAnfinn nf epenrino* their aceentanned etinnlri nnUr furthei 11 J__L±0 ^VJLCCJ UJ o w w ^ L ^ . 1 i ^^ ^ CtliU prolonged crisis in Anglo-Persian relations. This, in the view of the Foreign Office, would entail the following risks : The steps already taken by the Persian Government (see paragraph 3 above) would in all probability be cancelled; the fabric of reconciliation created by the recent exchange of Royal messages i i __ „ T/” 1 ^ ^ -d-T-v/'v OP o -P-ff 1 rvm cvrv F P Fprk Atv 13/ IclUJL IC U± KJJ CLl iiic&amp;S between the King and the Shah after the settlement of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s dispute would be destroyed; the chances of concluding a treaty for the settlement of the many outstanding disputes with Persia would be wrecked (preparations for the resumption of treaty negotiations were recently embarked xttUU fUr. r./-iT-iAnr*r’AnnA nf all ftip rlpnarfmAnts nnnAArnArlV tViA upon with the concurrence of all the departments concerned); the reciprocal undertaking of His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government to respect the status quo in the Persian Gulf pending the conclusion of the proposed treaty would automatically lapse; a state of acute tension would supervene in the Gulf; and Persia would almost certainly insist on the immediate evacuation of the British naval station on the Persian Island of Heniam (which exists there on tolerance only, having no sound legal basis). rja^ Kioi^ aemetnus wimuuo uno xxi^xx^xv/xx v^x ^ ^xxvxxlxvx vmj uc made if His Majesty’s Government are prepared to face the prospect of a serious and oriole In Ano-lr»_PAr«ian rAlatinns This, in thA vinw nf fVm ■ 'rfSlC 1 fl-&amp; 7. In addition to all this, Mr. Mallet considers, and the Foreign Office agree with him, that the Persian Government could not in any circumstances be coerced into compliance with the proposed demand for a public ceremony at Basidu; the means of coercion at the disposal of His Majesty’s Government are extremely limited, and the character of the Shah is as stubborn as it is violent. 8 . On the other hand, the suggestion has been put forward that the very real necessity for restoring the position in the eyes of the Arabs of the Persian Gulf could be sufficiently met by notifying the principal Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government had tendered their apologies for the incident, had taken disciplinary action against those responsible, had issued stringent instructions designed to preclude all possibility of a recurrence of such incidents in future, and had asked for particulars of other complaints against the Persian navy, expressing their willingness to investigate them and to settle all such outstanding cases (most of which closely concern the Arab sheikhdoms). 9. Mr. Mallet considers that the oral statements already made to him by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs would justify a statement to the Arab rulers to this effect, and considers that, if no additional demands are made, he , could obtain from the Persian Government an official apology and a written recapitulation of the various steps which they have taken in the matter. 10 . It seems to the Foreign Office that the additional advantages to be gained by the attempt to secure a ceremony at Basidu would be incommensurate with the risks incurred. They do not underestimate the seriousness of the affront, j ; and they fully appreciate the need for repairing the damage done to British prestige in the eyes of the Gulf Arabs. They consider, however, that if ocular proof is needed, at Basidu itself, of the determination of His Majesty’s Govern ment to maintain their position and to defend their rights, such proof has already been provided by the rehoisting of the British flag shortly after the incident and the instating^ of a British armed guard. It seems likely that an announcement to the Arab bheikhs on the lines proposed would be sufficient to put a stop to the rumours to which the incident is reported to have given rise, and to show the Arabs that His Majesty’s Government have not allowed the matter to pass unnoticed. Indeed, such action would from the practical point of view appear likely to be more effective than the mere staging of a small ceremony in a remoteBfitijlt.i and sparsely populated corner of the Gulf; and it must not be forgotten that, \ having regard to the personality of the Shah, if the demand for a ceremony, as the indications show, is strongly resented, the chance of securing Persian rsi aiit acquiescence, whatever steps are taken by His Majesty’s Government, must be regarded as remote. 11 . Looking at the question from the purely practical point of view of ,J WJl0 ^ of affairs in the Persian Gulf, it appears to the Foreign Office that to accept as sufficient the categorical instructions issued to the Persian navy, the severe reproof administered to its commander, the spontaneous regrets of the Persian ailce )^y Government and their offer to examine other complaints (with a satisfactory official note), coupled with the proposed corrective statement to the Arab Sheikhs, holds out far better prospects than what may prove a vain attempt to teach their navy a lesson with the attendant risks already enumerated.

CO{j&lt;Y- \/v4i r ^-V-JMVA&gt; The earlier history oi this question is summarised in the Departmental note on P.Z.538Q/33 helow. 2* In the light of the Secretary of State's instructions (Mr* Turnbull’s note of S9th August flsggaq] and of an interdepartmental discussion at the Foreign Office on 30th August, our telegram No.2139, on P.Z.5411/33, and the Foreign Office telegram on P.Z.5426/33 were sent to the Government of India and to Bushire respectively. Mr. Mallet has subsequently replied that he did not anticipate difficulty in obtaining a note of the nature desired from the Persians and that he was prepared to agree to our informing the Arabs that the Persians had apologised and that disciplinary action had been taken. The Resident in his telegram of 31st August rather grudgingly acquiesced in the proposal'to rest satisfied with a full communication to the Arab Sheikhs on the lines mentioned in the Secretary of State’s telegram of 29th August, while rather hinting that there was a good deal to be said for “taking a firm stand now that we had a case of unquestionable gravity in the eyes of any nation.“ 3 # y/e have since received the telegram from the S.N.O. dated 30th August, on P.Z. 5455/33 attached, which may make it rather less easy to abandon any 1 idea of visible reparation. Meanwhile, the Admiralty have asked that the matter should be taken in the j caomet ^ » in, I unaerstana, n eta(! placea on t ne Mk Slrl+j^A Cabinet Agenda for next Tuesday Ui The Foreign Office will/ 5000 3/33- 2 - w ill circulate a note setting out the history of the case and their point of view in regard it, and will, I gather, i i ' * 1 allow the India Office and the Admiralty to see the draft before it is finally submitted. a inference may be made to two other points: (a) the question whether any communication to the Arab sheikhs should be postponed until a note tas been obtained from the lersiansj (b) the Hesident's suggestion that the Persians might be asked forthwith to compensate for a Koweit dhow damaged at Henjam. 5 , As regards the first of these points, the Hesident originally preferred to make no communication until the Persian note had been received 'as it would I be calamitous for us to make any statement, especially about disciplinary action to which I attach great importance, which we cannot prove if challenged. ^ Mt. Mallet, on the other hand, saw no objection, remarking 'Even if oral statements were made to Arab rulers and I then failed to obtain note, I do not think Persian Government would go out of their way to challenge statements made already orally both to me hy Minister of Foreign Affairs and to Secretary by head of English section. I therefore see no objection to statement to Arab rulers in advance.' 1 The 3.N.O. telegram of 30th August, No.25455, may make the case for an immediate communication rather stronger, and the Resident has been asked whether his view as regards an advance communication remains unchanged in the light of it. The Admiralty are at this stage rather disposed to mark time until after discussion in the Cabinet. ^ • tv* wvva. [Ht, K 4i i-^tinute Paper. 3 Department. 6 As regards point (b) the Foreign Office are very averse from raising this question with the Persons and I think on the whole that there is substance in their objection. Experience in the past has always been that correspondence about claims of this nature is lengthy and involved and in the present case there is, I gather, the further complication that the Persians may claim that the dhow was within territorial waters as defined by them (i.e. 7 miles). I do not think that the advantage to be ‘ gained by taking the question up is sufficient to out-balance the disadvantage of the delay which might be involved and of the opportunity it would give the Persians to draw a red herring across the main Basidu Incident. ok, &lt; '^ v ’ Points to be included in statement to Arab Rulers referred to in secretary of State for India’s telegram No. 2139 of 29th August. (1) Persians have given emphatic assurance that Basidu and Iamb incidents occurred without orders from the Persian Government, who entirely disapproved. (2) Categorical instructions had been sent to Persian Navy that in future when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind they were to report for orders before taking action. (3) Similar instructions had been sent that they were to avoid all interference with Persian naval arrangements and collaborate in all possible ways. C-4) (In case of Koweit and Muscat). Persians have asked for particulars of other complaints against Persian Navy with a view to investigation. (The Political Resident would substitute for this that the Persians have promised investigation, and we may concur in this). 5) Persians have apologised. (6) Disciplinary action has been taken; and, in additior (7) The Political Resident is anxious to emphasise that M we had at once landed armed party* 1 .

They consider, however, that if ocular proof is needed, at Basicte'Itself, of the determination of his Majesty’s Government to maintain their position and to defend their rights, such proof has already been provided by the re- hoistingv«f the British flag shortly after the inoident and the Instating of a British ‘armed guard.

Your telegram No. 155, I thini: I can extract note in manner contemplated in paragraph 6. Yven if oral statements were made to Arab rulers and I then failed to obtain note I do not think Persian Government would go out of their way to challenge statements made already orally both to me by minister for Foreign Affairs and to Secretary by head of English section. I therefore see no objection to statement to Arab rulers in advance. As regards point 4 of proposed statement (paragraph 5 of your telegram) 5 I agree. I might in acknowledging Persian note remind kinister for Foreign Affairs about complaints regarding Dhows .and ask for early answers to my notes on those incidents. Point 5, I agree. Point 6: Feroughi certainly gave me to understand that in his view mere expression of Royal disapproval would be severe lesson for Bayendor and he seemed surprised when I hinted that it seemed insulficient. I chink we may therefore regard Shah's reproof as constituting in Persian eyes severe disciplinary action. I rather doubt if I can get direct mention of reproof in note but I would try.

Firstly^ (a). If it is impossible, for reasons of policy^ to obtain visible reparation,, the only course is to make the most of the verbal statement on the lines laid down in paragraph No e 2 3 and I would particularly emphasise that we had at once landed armed party. This statement should serve to quieten rumours, and if Persian Government make good their protestations for the future, we m.ay^ in course of time, be able to show the rulers concerned that our forbearance has been justified* It seems preferable, ©van if it entails a few days delay, not to communicate with Arab rulers till Persian not© has be©n received, as it would b© calamitous for us to make any statement {especially about disciplinary action, to which I attach great importance,) which w© could not prove if challenged, (c) e It would also be preferable-*CL. to avoid saying that Persians had asked for particulars of other complaints ? as partioulare of a number are already before them, but rather to say that they had promised investigations* it would, however, make this portion of the statement more convincing if the Persian Government would pay forthwith Rs a 300 for Koweit dnow damaged at Hen jam, (Damage was caused to innocent dhow by bad seamanship and they can hardly evade paying it sooner or later) * Secondly, our attitude tov/ard this incident seems to be governed largely by the possibility of concluding the general treaty* Having only recently returned to the Gulf, and holding charge temporarily, x put forward following comment with much diffidence* 2Jew paragraph*SECRET i 1 RB/LJC/KTP/MJ (21X groups) 4697 D E C Y P H E R .

As compared with the past, the change in our position and in the respect in which we are held in the Persian Gulf is more marked than I could haye conceiyed possible. Much of this seems to be traceable to our continued sacrifices oyer a period of nearly a decade in the unfulfilled hopes of concluding a general treaty with the Persian Government. If we give way the present incident I fear that, as soon as the immediate feeling of relief at their escape from serious consequences has r ° rn 0tt ’ the P roosss of attrition will begin again. Even should ' ? a0hleYe) a trea fy it would appear (? under these conditions) doubtful whether attrition would cease, whether we should be etter able in practice to defend our nationals and our friends our trade, or whether we should not have made further sacrifices to no purpose. If, on the other hand, we were to take a firm stand now when we had a case of unquestionable gravity in the eyes of any nation, we should impress the Gulf with the fact that, though we exercised long forbearance we had the power to2 aot if we wished to do so; and we might well regain for ourselves the respect even if we were to lose for a time the uncertain friendship of Persia. Thirdly. I appreciate, however, that means of enforcing reparation in face of the Persian attitude reported hy &lt;? d,Affairea &gt; «eed careful consideration and that we are bound by the League Covenant, though we are not, in this case, the aggressors.I attended a meeting at the Foreign Office, presided over by sir George Mounsey, at vtfiich the Admiralty were also present, on 29th August, to discuss the Basidu situation in the light of Mr. Mallet’s latest telegram on P.Z. below.

Addressed Tehran, repeated to Goverument of India NOoiS and Buuhire No„ 11 .Mr.Laithwaite, I spoke to the Secretary of State in the sense desired. He said that he agreed with the line you proposed to take at the meeting, namely,you should say that as at present advised the Secretary of State is not prepared to accept the full Admiralty programme of demanding a naval demonstration by the Persians at Basidu, that in his view the telegram from Mallet alters the situation, but that he agrees that the Arab reactions are important. He thinks that we should now telegraph to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and ask what in his view is the minimum which will be necessary to satisfy the Arab situation. The Secretary of State said that he thought that in telegraphing to Colonel Loch we ought to pass on to him the gist of what Mr.Mallet says in the two telegrams of the 28th August. I said that you also suggested that we should ask Mr.Mallet simultaneously whether we could now say publicly and for Arab consumption that the Persians have apologised for the incident and have taken disciplinary action, leaving the phrase merelyin general terms. The Secretary of State said that in his view it was a sine qua non that we should he able to say as much as this, but he agreed that we should ask Mr .Mallet. He thought • we ought to insist on the Persians taking disciplinary action but it did not very much matter what form it took. F.F.T. 2Sth August 1933.I /, P.Z. 53S8 foreign office, S.W.l., 29th August, 1933. With regard to the Basiduincident, I am asked to send you the enclosed copy of ^ personal telegranuffrom Mallet to Sir R• Yansittart, which reached us last night. 2. I should explain that Sir Robert's personal telegram to Mallet to which this is a reply (our telegram No. 130) gave Mallet the gist of the divergent views of the Admiralty. India Office and ourselves, and also gave him an explanation on the two points in regard to our official telegram No. 124 of the 19th August (a copy of which went to you in our letter No. E 4823/1273/34 of the 19th August), on which we were not quite sure that he understood our views here. 3. These two points were (a) that we and the India Laithwaite, Esq., lia Office. Office! Office had not contemplated taking extreme meaaures to secure complete compliance with our demands, if the Persian Govermpent took strong objection to them, (b) That, this being so, we had contemplated that the demands suggested in our telegram No. 123 could be put to the Persians in a way that would minimise the risk of infuriating the Shah. On this second point we incorporated in our telegram a passage on the lines of paragraph 3 and 4 of the draft telegram enclosed in my letter to you No. E 4900/1273/34 of the 24th August, 4. Sir Robert's telegram then put two questions to Me liet• fa) Whether, in the light of these explanations, he still felt that the mere presentation of such demands as were suggested in our telegram No. 123 would involve serious risk of destroying the hope of a friendly settlement of outstanding questions, provided that no extreme measures were taken in endeavouring to ensure a complete compliance with -r-3- with our demands. (h) What was Mallet's opinion as to the prospects of success and amount of risk involved in the India Office proposal that His Majesty's Government should decline to resume treaty negotiations if the Persians refused to accept our reasonable demands, and that this should be intimated to the Persian Government. 5. We think it would be well, if you agree, to hasre a discussion on these new telegrams, since Mallet's con versations with Feroughi have, in our opinion, considerably modified the situation. Will you let me know by telephone if representatives of the India Office could attend a meeting to be presided over by Sir George Mounsey here at 3.15 p.m. this afternoon? If this hour is inconvenient Sir George is prepared to arrange any other time ich would suit you better. I am sending a similar letter to Phillips, Admiralty.5398 1935 J NO DISTaiRUTinw . Decypher.

I had long conversation with Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday at which he repeated the different statements in my telegram No'. 180 with great solemnity. (? He said that) immediate instructions to Persian navy had been sent at express orders of the Shah to whom Feroughi had gone immediately after our last conversation, his Imperial Majesty was mucn upset by what had happened as he set real store by maintaining the best relations with us and early resumption of treaty negotiations. He had, Feroughi implied, wasned Major Bayendor’s head severely (though formal expression ”reprimand” was not actually used by Feroughi) and that officer would in future cultivate best possible relations with British navy. I told Feroughi that I could not imagine a Britisn officer snaking hands with a man who had insulted our flag. Feroughi replied that Bayendor was young and really friendly and had just married/x married an English wife. Whole thing was a mistake and a misunderstanding and could not His Majesty’s Government recognise this fact? I said that I had reason to believe tnat they would cei-tainly expect more. As regards the future I felt that the Shall’s prompt instructions ought to afford valuable guarantee but the past must be atoned for. 2. Feroughi who was uncomfortable and several times tried to change the subject finally gave me to understand that he could hardly dare to face the Shan with further demands wnich the Shan would certainly interpret as desire of His Majesty’s Government to humiliate him. I hinted that Iersian Government might make some spontaneous act oi reparation such as friendly demonstration of some sort at Basidu itseik. Feroughi said that Basidu was in Persian eyes considered to be Persian soil though we had a concession there and we must realise the strength of national sentiment. He had I think understood my hint and I take his remarks to mean that idea of ceremony at Basidu -would be quite ^ inacceptable. ^ 3. I denied any desire to humiliate, on the contrary if that had been our idea I snould not now be urging Feroughi in most friendly way to provide means to settle the case. 4o Feroughi ended by begging me to repeat to His Majesty’s Government that Persian Government were sincerely anxious to avoid any cause of controversy and hoped that stringent orders now given might be considered satisfactory solution. 5. I am now convinced that answer to your question (a) is that demand for any ceremony at Basidu will touch the/the Shah’s amour propre and land us in serious quarrel. He moreover thinks that he has behaved quite handsomely and any further demand from us (? gp. omt.) great shock to him. i-io regards dismissal of Bayendor X think one difficulty is that Persian government have nobody to take his place. We may reasonably argue that if an officer with no naval training were sent to succeed him incidents would occur even more frequently. Bayendor has certainly had a sharp lesson and I can imagine he will now behave very differently. 6. Your question (b) . Shah and Persian government are clearly keen on treaty negotiations but I doubt whether threat contemplated would be effective if the Shah gets really angry, at the same time I would not absolutely rule out possible use of this weapon in all circumstances. 7. Of course Persians will argue if Sir G. Hoare does not on his return make overtures for resumption of negotiations that His Majesty’s Government have decided to drop them or at least to leave them in cold storage and would realise why. Effect would probably be that Persia would consider statu quo agreement at an end and renew demand for evacuation of Hen jam. I do not see how otherwise Persians could call treaty off now as it is generally acknowledged that next move lies with us. 8. Although I would never admit it to Persians I feel there is something in Feroughi’s argument that those who saw the flag hauled down now see it flying again and thab this alone proves to the Arabs that we have got our way. 9/9. In estimating risk 0 f serious quarrel following point in material. In recent months we have benefited by strained relations between Persia and Kussia. They are now improving. Boycott is off and Karakhan is due here next month on mission of goodwill which Peroughi tells me it is hoped will resolve remaining points at issue which are maiiy commercial. The Shall may not therefore in future feel so dependent on our friendship.004/1273/34) MO DISTEIBITTTOW. Decypher. Mr. Mallett, (Tehran), 28th August, 1933„ Jo 1.40 p 0 m. 28th August, 1933.

On receiving the departmental note indicating the action which an interdepartmental committee, consisting of tiie Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office, had decided to recommend in the light of that telegram, he noted that he wished to he kept informed, and that 'we must not allow the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran to he weak.' As will he seen, that conference took the l view that Colonel Loch was asking for rather too much in suggesting that the 'Palang' should he required to rehoist the flag at Basidu and salute it with ai guns. Nor did it think that anything was to he gained hy referring the incident to the League or trying to bring pressure on Persia in respect of it either at the League or in the Arms Traffic Conference.. It had no very decided view about the Resident’s proposal that we should threaten to shadow Persian ships. On the other hand, Mr. Mallet’s line, as set out in Tehran telegram of 14th August, No. 173, was thought to he too weak. 3. Hie meeting therefore agreed, subject to the approval of higher authority, that Mr. tellet might he instructed to (a) protest vigorously and demand (h) an apology (c) dismissal or other adequate punishment of the officer responsible. (d) a ceremonial reparation in view of the importance of meeting the Arab reactions. 4/ Pn smmmm - 2 - 4. Tlie India Office suggested and the conference generally agreed that the ceremonial reparation might take the form of the parading of a Persian guard at Basidu to salute the British guard there and also the Flag. In view of the importance of getting some visible amends from the Persians it was undesirable to go much beyond this or press them with obviously unacceptable demands. Higher authority in the Foreign Office was not prepared to go so far as the interdepartmental meeting. Sir R. Vansittart wished to substitute disciplinary action* 1 for '•dismissal or other adequate punishment* and would only agree to telegraphing on the lines approved by the Committee subject to his being allowed to send a private telegram, asking the Charge d*Affaires to report before he acted on his official Instructions whether he thought we should be reasonably likely to succeed in obtaining the demands embodied in them. The Foreign Office ultimately agreed to ask for 'dismissal or other disciplinary action'. The India Office and Admiralty also agreed to the proposed personal telegram. The India Office took the opportunity to place their views in the matter on record (see letter of 19th August, No. P.Z.5031/33); to emphasise the serious nature of the incident and also their view that the Charge d-Affaires was possibly Wing undue attention to the Tehran aspect of the stion ana insufficient to its reactions in the Gulf 8y hlDteCi fiDal;Ly ^ ^iiure to secure adequate reparation from Persia m-ir.v,+ i ght well make it necessary to reconsider the desirability sxraDinty of pursuing the negotiations to the llgnt .hlcn this .onto cast on ol the Persian Go.eimient. 7/3 i nute Paper.

He remained of opinion, however, that we ought not to go heyond his original suggestions, though under pressure he would he prepared to go a little further. His views are set out in Foreign Office letter of 24th August on P.Z.5279. The Foreign Office were in general disposed to accept the views of the Charge d*Affaires and submitted a draft telegram. The draft telegram seemed to both the India Office and the Admiralty to b e unsatisfactory. The position was complicated by the fact that the Admiralty had raised their terms since the meeting of 16th August. They now insisted on the rehoisting of the flag by the ,, Palang ,, and also w r ished, failing compliance with our demands, to be allowed to shadow the Persian Navy. The India Office remained of opinion that J its attitude represented a reasonable compromise between the demands of the Admiralty and the desires of the Foreign Office, and thought that the proposals in Foreign Office telegram No.124 of 19th August, if they could be achieved, would adequately meet the case. Attention is invited to the India Office answer to the Foreign Office letter of 24th August on P.Z.5279/33 flagged. 8. Since then there have been certain further developments. In the first place the Foreign Office have telegraphed privately to Tehran to explain the present attitude of the India Office and Admiralty, and/and giving the gist of the instructions in which those Departments had been unable to concur, and to / - ask the Charge d'Affaires, in view of the probability that the matter must now go to the Cabinet unless it can be settled by ministerial discussion, for his further comments. His reply is still awaited. 9. Meanwhile, the Persians have themselves fomally repudiated responsibility for the Basldu incident (and also for the action of the Persian Navy in landing a French lighting expert at lamb) and have given definite instructions to the Navy of a character calculated to prevent any recurrence of such incidents. The head of the Persian Navy appears to have been rebuked and the Persians finally ask for an indication of other outstanding complaints against the Persian Navy. 10. This is satisfactory so far as it goes. But in view of Arab reactions in the Gulf (see on this point the Resident's telegram of 27tb August) it will probably still be thought desirable to secure some form of visible amends from the Persians, though in view of what is, I think, their obvious desire to liquidate the incident, we need not press them too far. The question as a whole will probably have to be reconsidered interdepartmentally in the light of Mr. Mallet's views when received. ff.[ 389/1273/34) 5380 (933 N0 tlSTRI BIITTOTJ. Decode.

We note that you propose to ask the Charge d*Affaires to reconsider, in the 11^t of the further information given in your telegram, his views on the question of asking the Persian Government for some form of visible amends, but that in the event of his being unable to do sq you would leave him to address the Persian Government in accordance with proposals which he thinks might be risked, namely:- 1* Apology in writing, 2.

The Board of Admiralty fully realise the difficulties of the position, out they feel that thdy would not be justified In agreeing to accept any form of amends which does not include In it some public ceremony, having as its essential the rehoisting of the flag by the Persians. 4 , I suppose that in these circumstances the matter will have to go to Ministers, notwlthutanding that this may lead to some delay,x asswft© that you will tait© act!on ic-ordlngly to refer It to them.

They are equally justified in expecting the Persians to deal adequately with it. The action proposed in the official telegram from the Foreign Office No.13^ of 19th august does not go beyond adequate reparation (I gather indeed that the Admiralty doubt if it goes sufficiently far); hut if the Persians are not prepared to go as far as that telegram suggests the resumption of negotiations in tne near future would : : j he exceedingly difficult and a hint v*U to this effect o aftRI. he given to them r in/ , Iin advance. It would ioe impossible for H.M.G. tamely to acquiesce in sued an incident, officially avowed by -the Persian Government, and to continue to negotiate as though, nothing had Happened. 2. As for the possible results of an unfriendly Persian reaction to our suggestions, so far as Henjarn is concerned we can at worst demand reasonable notice, and it is always possible that the Persians, when face with the prospect of a real break 1 with H.K.G., will not wish to press d us to the point of expelling us. as to Bahrein, Tarnb, etc., e-ur c-aco is in the first place a good on^in the second, it would be possible for 1 s^sia to take uS/Afeiore the xeague only by torfudus methods which could be rented; while, finally, the Cb&amp;Ah have laid It down that we are to adopt a firm policy towards i'-iaia and now allow ourselves to be influenced by threats of reference o- Bahidn, etc. to the League.

E 4900/1273/34 r~ z^- Bmn y n y / w sLc, i W6 have received, ard. considered, ihe renly from our Charge d'Affaires at Tehran to Sr Robert Van- sittart*s telegram asking for his views on the pro posed amends to be demanded from the Persians for the flag incident at Basidu. Mallet expresses the opinion that two alternative lines of action are open to H*M. Government in this lH-C matter. They can^ either treat this incident as an opportunity for asserting themselves in the Persian Gulf and for administering a severe snub to the Persian Navy, as the Acting Resident at Bushire and the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf have suggested, but Mallet emphasises that to do so in volves ignoring the possible effects of our action upon the Shah. He considers that, if this course is decided upon, we must frankly face the fact that C a note however stiff will not Effect compliance with Laithwaite, Esq.our demands; something much more drastic would presumes (and we suppose that the^India Office will certainly agree on this point as we do), that H«M. Government would not wish to take Persia to the League of Nations over this matter, and, after discarding the possibility of withdrawing our mission in Tehran, as unlikely to achieve the object in view, he says that the only measures he can suggest are the immediate and os tentatious reinforcement of the Persian Gulf squadron and the shadowing of each Persian naval unit, if feasible, by a British vessel. Mallet then proceeds that in the event of our taking such measures we must expect intense resentment on the part of the Shah and the Persian Government with the consequent disappearance of all hope of settling the questions between Persia and this country, concerning the Persian Gulf, by friendly means. The Persians would then certainly renew the notice to abandon the naval station at Henjam at once and might well decide to refer the disputed....disputed questions concerning the Gulf to the League of Nations, including Bahrein etc. If it is decided that the risks which Mallet mentions are out of proportion to the end to he gained, (and in our opinion we should, even if we took this course, not secure Persian compliance with our demands, so that we should he running the risks to no purpose), the alternative course open to H.M. Government, in Mallet's opinion, involves adapting our demands in such a way as to avoid any great risk of infuriating the Shah. In that case, Mallet would still prefer the course proposed in the 8th paragraph of his telegram No. 175 of the 14th August, a copy of which was enclosed in our official letter to you, E 4686/1275/34 of the 16th August, as being demands, compliance with \tiich we could secure. If, however, these are thought too mild, Mallet says that he would 'risk the following without venturing to guarantee compliance: (1) an apology in writing, (2) disciplinary action against responsible officer, nature of which to he reported to me, (3) undertaking toour..•. to issue instructions to Persian Navy not to molest the British flag at Basidu or elsewhere in the Gulf.” He adds ’’your telegram No. 124 speaks of dismissal or adequate disciplinary action. I prefer the latter but if we mean dismissal we must not mention any milder alternative. Even above demands may quite easily put the Shales back up”. You will observe that Mallet still objects to our demanding any ceremony at Basidu. His argument on this point is that what we propose would be un impressive and almost as difficult to get as the full ceremony proposed by the Acting Resident. In view of Mallet's opinion, Sir Robert Vansittart is not prepared to instruct him to carry out the instructions in our telegram No. 214 of the 19th August and would prefer to acquiesce in Mallet's pro posals quoted above. We thihk, however, that Mallet may be under some misapprehension on two points (a) as to our intending to insist on Persian compliance with our demands at all costs, and therefore (b) as to the manner of puttingour demands to the Persians. Sir Robert is prepared therefore to instruct Mallet as in the attached draft, (wnich we have made as comprehensive and self-contained as possible for the benefit of the Acting Resident and the Government of India, to whom it would be repeated). Sir Robert could not agree to go further than this, and we hope that the India Office will agree. If not Sir Robert feels that there is no alternative, in spite of the unfortunate delay which it would involve but to refer the matter at once to Ministers. We are pointing out to the Admiralty that, in view of the above, we cannot for a moment contemplate any additions to the ceremony at Basidu such as the re hoisting of the flag by the Persians, which the Admiralty have suggested since they concurred in our telegram No. 124 to Mallet. Sir Robert would be grateful if we might receive your reply to this letter at the earliest possible moment. It would be desirable, if possible, to get final instructions off to Mallet to-day as I have little doubt...,doubt you will agree. I am s &lt; l / \A^U**r / PZ? _ J ending a similar letter to^the Admiralty. P.S. I now enelose advance copies of two further telegrams from Mallet, from which you will see that he spoke very stiffly to the Persian Minist£|^for Foreign Affairs and has done his best to prepare the way for our demands. You will also note that the ’’official responsible” appears to be Major Bayendor, the Commanding Officer of the Persian Navy, which would obviously make a demand for actual dismissal a very strong measure indeed*f-4 '%r.

I have avoided going near Ministry of Foreign Affairs penning receipt of definite instructions regarding note hut yesterday I nappened to meet Minister for Foreign Affairs and was able to have a short private conversation. I told Minister for Foreign Affairs that I was appalled at ' ! the lighthearted way in which the Persian Government appeared to he treating the events at Basidu. He said he had hoped the incident had been closed. He had told me Persian Government had not a hand in it and that the officer concerned happened to he passing Basidu and seeing a British flag with nobody looking after it hauled it down. Now that the flag had been re-hoisted what was all the fuss about. I told him I had every indication that His Majesty’s Government were not going to let this insult pass unheeded and that I thought it only fair to warn him that I should probably soon receive instructions from you to send him a note which he would not like at alio As for the plea that the naval officer had acted in all innocence I asked His Highness whether the Senior Naval Officer of the Persian navy was or was not respon sible person. If so he ought to know how long our flag had flown at Basidu and His Majesty's Government would never accept such a flimsy excuse. Moreover the Persian custom house Mu dirkudir could easily have enlightened him. By his 'behaviour ha]or Bayendor had made it impossible for any British naval officer e^er- to speak to him again. I knew how bitterly the naval Commander-in-Chief felt about the matter. I deplored this situation in view of the earlier friendliness shown by our navy and the special privileges promised by the Admiralty for training young Persian officers (your despatch No. 215). minister for foreign Affairs seemed to be considerably shaken and asked what more could be done now that the flag had been re-hoisted. I said yes but by whom? What would His Highness say if our Senior Naval Officer had hauled down the Persian flag at Sirri for instance? I suggested that mere words were useless and that the 'amende honorable' might well be regarded. In fact I went so far as I could towards hinting that Major Bayendor must go. Whether Minister for Foreign Affairs will take the hint remains to be seen but I think that I succeeded in shattering his equanimity. He did not demur when I assumed the status quo agreement v/as still operative and he seemed as unhappy as I was at the idea of serious crisis in our relations towards which I warned him that he was being led by the irresponsible behaviour of the Persian navy not only at Basidu but at Iamb and elsewhere,,HC DISTRIBUTION Decypher.

While sympathizing on the one hand with your desire not to spoil the existing friendly atmosphere at Tehran and with it the chances of a treaty settlement, and on the other with Resident and Commander-in-chief’s view that it is desirable to show strong resentment and to repair probable damage to prestige in Arab eyes, and while agreeing with you that insistence on the elaborate ceremony advocated by the Politica.l Resident in view of personality of Shah would merely infui iate him and result in getting nothing at all, it is desiied to demand apology, dismissal of or adequate disciplinary action against offender, and some form of visible amends on spot. Fact that hauling down of flag (alleged tearing is not supported by sufficient evidence) was done without instructions from above would surely make it easier for Persian Government to agree to dismiss those responsible. Disciplinary action against individual involved (as opposed to mere apologies Feroughi) will alone discourage high-handed actions of which Persian ships have so frequently been guilty, and is thus one of our essential desiderata.

I suggest also that you should make play with point that officer responsible acted without instructions, and that Persian Government will no doubt wish to emphasize this and to show their extreme disapproval of his action. You may think fit also to meet beforehand possible Persian excuse based on officer’s ignorance of position at Basidu (see paragraph 1 of your telegram No. 171), which cannot justify his assuming the right to interfere with British flag. You should then present demand for official apology, dismissal or adequate disciplinary action against official or officials responsible for incident and visible reparation at Basidu for insult to flag. I prefer to leave precise wording ol note to gou in order that you may so phrase it, without weakening its foice, as oo meet so far as possible Shall's personal susceptibiid ui^s.

Ify telegram No. 171 s hows main facts are not die- (!./' puted by Persian Government. Tearing flag is however denied by Persian Naval authorities and our evidence seems hardly conclusive enough to take up this detail. Resident in Persian Gulf naturally and rightly is concerned with effect of incident on Arabs. I am concerned regarding effect on our relations with Persian Government. Our point of view is thus in evitably somewhat different though in each case rather parochial so that I can only submit my opinion for (grp. undec.) without purview of His Majesty's Govern- rneno.- q, * (2 grp Sc urcloc.) couiiory it might he incredible for Naval officers to act thus without orders from Headquarters. Here anything is possible as even general staff seem to have very shadowy idea about and very little control over the Navy. Hqually it seems odd that general staff should be so ignorant about Basidu but it is perfectly possible,, I doubt whether anybody in ministry of far has ever been near to the place or if anybody in ministry of Foreign Affairs h a s © o ©2 ha toured Persian Gulf. This Legation is certainly i-.acn beuter informed (grp. unclec.) history and geosrapny than is Ministry, I uneretore believe it is true no orders emanated from Persian Government nor do I think the Shah himself gave orders, for the minister for Foreign affairs v/ould not tnen have dared to raise the question mlth him as reported in my telegram No. 172 L I am certain minister for Foreign affairs is distinctly embarrassed by the incident which is obviously entirely incompatible with his recent friendly policy. He has frequently emphasized to me Shah 1 s anxiety for good relations and I feel certain that genuine if clumsy effort is being made here to carry out His majesty’s commands. Several small matters ’save recently showed the 'tay the mind is blowing and I nave even reason to believe Townshend Smith may be pardoned on Shah’s personal orders though this not yet officially con firmed. If I believed Basidu incident had been deliberately ordered by the Shah I should feel obliged to recommend that we take up the challenge and endorse Resident’s drastic proposals, thus facing certainty of first class row which would involve abandonment of any idea of resuming treaty negotiations. As it is Minister for Foreign Affairs has so far made no attempt to justify action of Persian navy. They have admitted that navy acted entirely on its own. In other ^ords Persian Government did[ndtjwishjjto resume treaty negotiations in the autumn Demands suggested in heading 4 of BushireBushire telegram would not merely Be unpalatable to the Shah hut would destroy probably for ever the whole fabric of reconciliation woven by exchange of royal messages after oil settlemento The ShahS isss suspicions of our motives which his Ministers thought had at last been dispelled would be roused to fever point. He would never forgive us for public humiliation and would find many ways of (grp, undec*) incidents in the Persian Gulf beginning with a renewed demand for evacuation of Kenjam c I cannot believe that His majesty’s Government desire to raise whole question of status of Easidu at Geneva -or do I think we should get much sympathy at arms traffic committee a To insist on dismissal of responsible o±„icer (presumably Major Bayelpw) would I fear have almost as bad effect on the Shah who has a quasi paternal feeling for all officers, le might get our way but the officers would probably be promoted else where and, his successor would feel that premium had thus been put upon truculence. If oo nou insist on dismissal it is just conceivable that the Stiah will spontaneously punish the officer, I think the most I could do, would be to suggest punishment orally when handing in written note, I realise that action proposed below looks weak compared with Ee si dent's desiderata but I * 3el thaw u-mess His majesty's Government desire to abandon all idea of treaty tne most I should ask for after first outliningo c «4 ouu-Llaing a vent) b aria prate Gting strongly should be ( 1) cioSUiEijce onat 'tiiG actron ox Perniari Navy v/aG neither instigated, nor approved by Persian Government (2) stringent oraers be given to avoid, any further in cident ox a st'.iilar nature (3) warn Persian Govern ment that forbearance shown this time will not be repeat3d 0 i might add preferably orally that ’ oyal Navy have extended every possible courtesy to the Persian fleet but that friendly comradeship can hardly be expected to continue unless there is complete change in be haviour of Persian officers who though they may have received no orders about specified incidents that have occurred hitherto must have received a general commission to assert themselves which they are obviously carrying out regardless of international consequences* If I can thus get officia.1 disotvowcil by Persian Government of action of their naval officers it will surely be sufficient proof of their intention not to disturb Gulf status quo ante pending treaty negotiations. If on the other hand the Persian Government refuse us even this slight satisfaction we should have to tell them that they have killed all negotiations. Next step would be to send two more of His Hajesty’s Ships to the Gulf and have Persian ships shadowed.

Babr) was mentioned by Persian sailors who may well have deliberately given wrong name. Frenchman (? is) presumably lighting and buoying expert who was in Palang on July 23rd. This establishes that Palang was ship concerned. Secondly 0 There seems no doubt that incident, including hauling down of flag, took place s ubstantially'as described,. Act was, therefore, deliberate act done by a body of officers, possibly led by Senior Officer of Persian Navy and cannot in any case be construed into being the act of irresponsible individuals. Act was moreover carried out in front of their own »W- - — witimvnaBjumgRiiiflMtnaM'iiifij 1 1 1 ,, sailors and local people (doubtless more than would dare to admit to us that they had seen it). (?

I appreciate that (? omission) may not be ea^y* to prevail upon Persian Government to offer suitable reparations and that we are (? handicapped) by {? our) commitments in Persia and by the probability that Persian Government will try to confuse the issue by raising the question of statue of B&amp;sidu. At the same time, in view of the importance, both of the immediate incident* and of the general principle at stake (that is to say* whether Persian navy is to be allowed to be a law itself in the Persian Gulf) it seems hardly possible* with dignity, (? to do) (? otherwise) than to insist on visible reparations. The most fitting reparation would be that the w palang n should rehoist the British flag at Basidu with due ceremony and salute it with 21 guns in the presence of our Senior H&amp;val Officer. This would be unpalatable to Persian susceptibilities but I think that we {? omission) impress upon them in unmistakable terms* that their officers have deliberately committed a public act unthinkable in civilised international relations.

We must clearly wait until we get further information as to the alleged hauling down of the flag. As the S.N.O. sailed yesterday from Bushire to Basidu this ought to reach us in the very near future. 2. I understand demi-officially from the Foreign Office that they have received a a telegram from Mr. Mallet at Tehran, copies of which will de sent to us, to the effect that, meeting the Persian Foreign Minister at a dinner party on the 6th, he referred to the Basidu incident, which was apparently quite new to Feroughi, and emphasised that the/ 1 5041 2000 1.31the 'Palang”, which was the responsible ship, was also the vessel concerned in the McLeod incident. Without committing himself he urged that Feroughi should take steps to acquaint himself with what was happening in the Gulf, and Feroughi appeared to be impressed by the comments of the s' Charge d'Affaires. 3. The incident, if proved, is a very serious one. In any case there will probably be much to be said for some comment to the Persian Government on the activities of the Persian Navy and of Persian officials / in Basidu. Any such comment will probably, however, need to be carefully worded. We hold Basidu under a concession from the Sultan of Muscat, but what is not quite clearat the moment is vhether the sultan of Muscat granted the concession in his capacity as a tenant of Persia or as a sovereign, and we shall probably nou wish to face the issue too bluntly while treaty negotiations are in the air. But in the interest of preserving the value of Basidu as a factor in the treaty negotiations it is most important not to allow the present incident to pass without comment. p-z uc &lt;x^. p v ^ ^ Gu 7?« ‘Hr Ar tNO DI ST mi BUT I ON « Decode.

I happened to meet Minister for Foreign Affairs today at a tea party and spoke very seriously to him. I supposed he had full information regarding activities of Persian navy. He said no. in that case I said he presumably had not heard of the grave incident last Wednesday. He professed complete ignorance. I then related events at Basidu. I told Minister for Foreign Affairs that matter had been reported to you, that I felt sure you would take grave view and that I should certainly soon receive instructions though I would not venture to anticipate what they might be. I was glad, however, to have had the chance of speaking privately at once to His Highness as it would at least give him time to make urgent enquiries and to issue orders that British flag which had been re hoisted should not be molested again. I felt sure that he would agree with me (which he did) that when we were working hard to avoid any strain to good relations it seemed hard that our efforts should be thwarted by minor officials ignorance of international politics. I added that the ship was the one involved in Macleod incident.

After proceeding about a mile we saw the somewhat unusual sight ©f an Arab running to meet us. He turned out t o be Rhaikh Mo in Afcsari (the Caretaker) who had been apprised of our arrival by a youth on the pier. 3 , Shaikh Main hade the usual complaints that the Persian Hudir of Customs had frequently visited the Village of Bingati and had clone so in the last fi fteen davs. Persian sublecte in British Basidu had beep instructed not to le* ve until after the census, which will be taken shortly* Persian dhows - some beached on British territory, others lying in British waters - were ordered to remain where they were for the same Puri use. ^hev were also required to pay Customs dues, for which they voluntarily crossed over to the Persian Cue toys House. 4 , It al.o reported that W other reaaon forthe jludlr of Cue tons t! siting British Bsstdu sas to ascertain the names of si siting British warships for r.oort, si toother rtiattars, to his superior at r 4 ng*h, with weon, 1 red from what I heard, the Wudlr is anxious to placate himself hy Shoving excesslTe seal, at the expense, i necessary, of yeracity in his reports. 5 , '‘he Caretaker states that he has made numerous report* ’eraian actions to H. if.

The kindly and somewhat placid police official, who accompanied, the Hudir, offered our party a drink of water at this stafee, .which was gladly accepted by my Interpreter end Shaikh '•oin. I subsequently sent a message to this official to thank him for his consideration fo&gt;* the Officers of ^horeham*: a message which I think ^ieht save the I'udir of Customs a little trouble in hi a efforts to find out the name of the ship on a rather hot day. B# th our return we passed the date garden of Abdulla (?)

It was interesting ;o learn that the collector of this tax had informed him that he had been ordered to refund it, the money has not yet been received, but he thought that H.r.Consul, Bandar Abbas, had it and that he would receive it in due course. 9* I inspected the Cemetery and two water tanks (bhodadad Charity/) recent ly repaired b contract.

I inspected Royal Indian Marine Establishments at Henjam on 26th November, and was impressed by the excellent stowage of godowns and the cleanliness of the living quarters. The preparation of the sports ground for the Annual Sports of the Persian Gulf Division also reflected great credit on Mr.C.Telles, the Clerk-in-Charge. The Deputy Governor readily assented to my requests that the Master and Officers of s.s. 'BAHARISTAN' (discharging coal) and Mr.Jefferies, Admiralty Inspector of Stores, who was on duty in H BIDEFORD H should be allowed to land at Henjam for the sports, although not in possession of passports. He raised an objection however to a party from 'TRIAD” dismantling the distilling plant on the grounds that they mighi be landing arms. The work was performed at the request of the Flag Officer Commanding Royal Indian Marine, and the Engineer Officer had taken the precaution of passing all tools through the Persian customs. The Deputy Governor threatened to report the matter to Tehran, and to ^t the Clerk-in-Charge removed. He admitted afterwards that he had acted in a fit of temper, and wished to close the incident. During 'FOWEY*S M visit to Basidu, the caretaker complained that Persian Customs officials used British territory to prevent smuggling from dhows. A small party of representatives of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company arrived at Henjam late in November and proceeded to Quishm, prospecting for oil.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000156_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3775</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000156</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3775</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/58 'Persian Gulf.
