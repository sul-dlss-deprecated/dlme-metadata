As there is no extradition treaty his arrest by the Muscat Authorities could not be demanded. The action taken by you was perfectly correct in my opinion. 3 * 1 do not consider the Post Officer, Sunt Sa^s action in going to the Wali direct is a serious matter, ^t was probably due to ignorance.

It is clear that the Iranians cannot get access to Gwadur by land, unless they enter and cross the Indo-Iranian bonders. It also appears from this that those, who are on the Indo-Iranian frontiers do not retard the runaways from entering their borders. U.E.
