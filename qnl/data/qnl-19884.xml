Hennell informs Sheil that Mr Ferrier's statement, which Sheil referred to in his earlier despatch, has caused Hennell to change his belief in Mirza Mahmood's innocence. Hennell reports that the Agent has not provided an explanation to counter Sheil's suspicions. Hennell concludes by stating that twelve tomans have been deducted from the Agent's salary. This letter includes the following enclosures:Translated extract of a letter, which is not dated, from Mirza Mahmood, Agent at Shiraz, to Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the disappearance of a valuable shawl belonging to Mr Tasker;Translation of a declaration, which is not dated, made by two semsars of Shiraz, regarding the disturbances in that city following the Shah's death, during which some of their property was plundered.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00003a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
