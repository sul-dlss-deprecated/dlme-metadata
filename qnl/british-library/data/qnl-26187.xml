The desiderata cf H.M.G. communicated to Fuad Hamza, the most important of which was the establishment of a beacon light upon Jinnah Island, and Fuad Hamzat reply, laying down the various conditions, are conveniently summarised in the Foreign Office despatch belowj, H.M.G. object to the desire of the Saudi Government to separate the discussions for facilities for the R.A.F. and those for facilities for Imperial Airways. If, however, the Saudi Government refuse to give way over this point, Sir Andrew Ryan has been instructed to obtain as much as possible for the use of the R.A.F. and omit any mention of Imperial Airway s/** rtitifrurti—jM tm 2 . Airways. On the other hand, H.M.G. do not consider the present situation altogether unsatisfactory, and they are therefore not prepared to make any very great sacrifices to obtain facilities. Sir Andrew Ryan's instructions are therefore rather limited and do not include the offer of any definite payment in return for the facilities required. 2 . It is the financial aspect of the question in which we are directly interested, as it is possible that payment will be made by remission of the Saudi debt due to H.M.G.Jtop arms supplied Isjy the Government of India in 1929. It was agreed, however, at an interdepartmental meeting this summer, that the two questions of air facilities and the debt should be treated separately, at any rate until the intentions of the Saudi Government in regard to the repayment of the debt were clearer. We shall not, therefore, be directly interested in the proposed negotiations for air facilities until the two questions have race mo&amp;e been linked up. fc-, U-~t ^ 4^*^ */■ (l\a^X4. ^ ^ Hooi ■i-!i - C (. 5 ; /) • ) — / 0 ,J i | 1935 ^ /Fa.

CONFIDENTIAL. 1935 1 Section 2. • [E 6441/1217/25] Sir Samuel Home to Sir A . Ryan {on leave). (No. 319.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 31, 1935. YOU will recollect that an opportunity was taken during the course of the conversations with the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in London last summer to raise again the question of certain facilities for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force, and of regular British commercial air services flying along the air route on the south-western shore of the Persian Gulf between Koweit and Bahrein. 2. The desiderata of the Air Ministry were explained to Fuad Bey Hamza at the second meeting at the Foreign Office on the 25th June, and they were confirmed in a letter addressed to Fuad Bey by Mr. Rendel on the 27th June. A print copy of the record of the meeting and of Mr. Rendel’s letter is enclosed.(') For convenience of reference, the Air Ministry desiderata may be summarised as [ follows, in the order in which they were mentioned to Fuad Bey :— (1) General permission for the British aircraft concerned to fly within Saudi territorial waters, off the Hasa coast, within gliding distance of the land. (2) General permission for the Royal Air Force authorities to send the necessary minimum of assistance in an emergency at their discretion, by air, land or sea, to stranded aircraft within the Hasa Province. (3) Authority for the Royal Air Force to put in order (if necessary) and to maintain the emergency landing grounds already believed to exist on Jinnah Island, at Qatif and Res-as-Safaniyah, and to use them in emergency only. (4) Permission for the Air Ministry to establish and maintain an airway automatic light beacon on Jinnah Island for the guidance of aircraft living down the Hasa coast by night. (5) The eventual co-operation of the Saudi authorities with the proposed central weather forecasting station at Basra. 3. At the meeting on the 24th June, Fuad Bey Hamza did not exclude in principle any of the desiderata put to him, but insisted on the necessity for scrupulous respect of Saudi territorial sovereignty and the avoidance of any impression of foreign interference in the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia. He also mentioned other more concrete considerations, which, after consulting his Government, he subsequently defined as follows, in a letter of the 6th July to Mr. Rendel (a print copy of which is enclosed)! 2 ) :— {a) Facilities for Imperial Airways (Limited) would have to be negotiated separately between the Saudi Government and the company, whereas those concerning the Royal Air Force would be negotiated through the diplomatic channel. (5) Facilities for the Royal Air Force would have to be in accordance with a clear agreement in the form of a “ contract or convention for a fixed period. “ in which should be set forth in detail the matters which may or may not be undertaken.” A “ general unconditional permission ” wouM be contrary to Saudi interests, however simple the facilities in question. (c) The Saudi Government would expect a fixed annual payment for any i facilities granted. ( 1 ) “Eastern (Arabia),” June 25, section 2. ( 2 ) “Eastern (Arabia),” July 8, section 2. [531 hh—2]{d) The Saudi Government could not agree to the necessary constructional and maintenance work involved by facilities (3) and (4) in the preceding paragraph being carried out by Royal Air Force personnel. Such work would have to be executed by the Saudi authorities in accordance with an agreed specification which might be set out in the formal agreement. 4. The whole question has now been re-examined by the competent depart ments of His Majesty’s Government in the light of the discussions and correspondence with Fuad Bey Hamza. His Majesty's Government are disposed to think that, in view of the Saudi attitude, there would be little advantage in pressing their request for air facilities at present, since this might easily convey an impression of anxiety which would tend to stiffen the conditions attached by the Saudi Government to the grant of the facilities and increase their demands for financial compensation. Moreover, the Air Ministry do not regard the present position as altogether unsatisfactory, since there has been no case of a forced landing on the Hasa coast during the past year, and the risk of such a mishap is steadily diminishing as the reliability of engines and the range of aircraft increase and the meteorological organisation in the Persian Gulf improves. 5. At the same time, the desired facilities would undoubtedly facilitate the passage of British aircraft down the Persian Gulf, and put an end to the danger of an awkward political incident arising out of a forced landing in Saudi territory. His Majesty’s Government have therefore decided to furnish you with the following instructions, so that you may be able to pursue the question of air facilities with the Saudi authorities on your return to Arabia. They appreciate that a favourable opportunity for this purpose is unlikely to arise during the course of your forthcoming visit to Riyadh—although, if one should present itself you are, of course, authorised to take advantage of it—and they are content to leave entirely to your discretion the choice of the moment for approaching the Saudi Government again in the matter. 6. His Majesty’s Government consider that, with one exception, the conditions formulated by Fuad Bey Hamza in his'letter of the 6th July need not necessarily preclude in practice the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement with the Saudi Government. The exception is the insistence of Fuad Bey on separate negotiations being conducted with Imperial Airways (Limited) in respect of facilities desired for the company’s aircraft. This manoeuvre is apparently inspired by the hope of extracting two distinct annual payments for the same facilities and is inacceptable. You should, therefore, make it clear to the Saudi Government that His Majesty’s Government can see no reason for two sets of negotiations on the same subject, since, as was pointed out to Fuad Bey in London, no distinction is made between the Royal Air Force and Imperiaf Airways in matters connected with the organisation of the air route in the Persian Gulf. It is true that Imperial Airways have previously negotiated agreements with foreign Governments direct— e.g., in Egypt and Iraq—but there is no real analogy, since in those cases the company were running a regular service through the countries concerned, thus necessitating the settlement of a large number of points of detail; whereas, in the case of Saudi Arabia, they only require permission to fly over or land in Saudi territory in case of emergency, a permission, moreover, which is identical with that desired for the Royal i^ir Force. Again, any payment made by Imperial Airways would, in practice, emanate from His Majesty’s Government, since it would involve increasing the amount of the official subsidy to the company. You should explain the foregoing considerations to the Saudi Government, and should impress upon them that in the present case there can be no question of the position of Imperial Airways being dealt with in direct negotiations with the company otherwise than through the normal diplomatic channel. 7. Should the Saudi Government maintain their insistence on separate negotiations with Imperial Airways, or should they make difficulties over the other conditions mentioned by Fuad Bey, it will clearly be impossible to obtain all the facilities which were requested last summer. His Majesty’s Government •consider that, in that event, it will be best for you simply to concentrate on obtaining as much as the Saudi Government can be induced to grant for the use of the Royal Air Force and to omit any mention of Imperial Airways. The facilities in question are actually less necessary for Imperial Airways, whose3 ce to he course, i multi-engined aircraft are less likely than those of the Royal Air For obliged to make forced landings. Moreover, the company would, of course, automatically profit by the provision (even if primarily established for the Royal Air Force) of an airway beacon on Jinnah Island, or by Saudi co-operation in meteorological services. 8. For your information and guidance. His Majesty’s Government are now disposed to rank the facilities described and numbered in paragraph 2 above in the following order of importance : — (4), (1), (2), (3), (5). As you will see from the enclosed print, the reasons why His Majesty's Government desire these facilities were fully explained to Fuad Bey in the course of the second meeting in London last summer, and were repeated in Mr. Rendel’s letter of the 27th June to him. In resuming negotiations on the subject, it will, however, be necessary for you to meet as far as possible the conditions put forward by the Saudi Government in Fuad Bey’s letter of the 6th July, and you should, accordingly, also be guided by the following supplementary instructions in regard to the individual facilities. 9. The insistence of the Saudi Government^ that all constructional and maintenance work shall be carried out entirely by their own personnel, is impracticable in the case of the proposed airway beacon (facility No. (4)). It would be necessarv for one or possibly two experts from the firm providing the beacon to supervise its actual erection and the construction of the necessary concrete and metal work for the base and mounting of the light. Little is yet known about these automatic beacons, and this work could not be executed simply by following plans, although Saudi labour could, no doubt, carry out the actual work. At the same time, with a view to meeting the susceptibilities of the Saudi Government as far as possible, you may suggest to them that the matter could be arranged to general satisfaction if the experts were to be joined by Saudi officials, and to proceed to Jinnah Island together by a launch or steamer flying the Saudi flag, in order to indicate clearly the fact of Saudi sovereignty over the island. Similarly, the necessary periodical visits for refuelling the beacon (every two or three months) could be performed by Royal Air lorce personnel in the company of Saudi officials, who could be met by arrangement at some place on the coast, such as Uqair. The Royal Air Force would be responsible for all transport and other arrangements. 10 The prospects of the Saudi Government according facility No. (1)— permission to fly within gliding distance of the Hasa coast—clearly depends upon the interpretation laid by the Saudi Government ot Fuad Bey s reseivation summarised at (b) in paragraph 3 above. Aircraft are now continually fly in g on passage between Koweit and Bahrein, and it would be quite impossible to seek prior permission on each occasion when it was desired to fly over Saudi territorial waters or even to notify such action in advance. A general authorisation covering all Royal Air Force machines (a.ui if possible those of Imperial Airways as well) will alone suffice to make this facility of any value At the ;ame time you may mention the readiness of His Majesty s Government to include in any agreement with the Saudi Government a specific undertaking that every effort'would he made to avoid flying over the land, and that aircraft would, in any case only avail themselves of the permission to fly over Saudi territorial waters in case of danger through bad weather or the risk of engine failure. 11 There seems to be little likelihood of the Saudi Government agreeing to accord General permission for the Royal Air Force to enter and fly over Saudi territory without previous notification in order to rescue stranded aircraft fac Uty No (2)). It may. however, help yon in the presentation of your case on hts point to insist on the fact that such action-which would, of course, be subject to immediate notification to the Sand. Government-would only he taken in cases where there wa° manifest danger to human life, e.g in the case of a flying boat forced down in rough water or a machine stranded in an uninhabited and waterless desert. government can be induced to allow the use in emergency of one or all of tL ffind.ng grounds required under facility No (3), the arrange ments for construction and maintenance should present less difficulty than in the case of the airway beacon. All that is required at each landing ground apart possibly from a certain amount of levelling, is a white circle in the centre and4 four white L-shaped marks at the corners, and these can be easily constructed in concrete and maintained with whitewash. It would clearly be preferable if the landing grounds could be inspected in the first place by a Royal Air Force official; but if the Saudi Government prefer not to avail themselves of Royal Air Force assistance, they could doubtless themselves execute the necessary work, with the co-operation of the pilots in their own air force, on the basis of plans furnished to them. Alternatively, the Royal Air Force could carry out the work in conjunction with the Saudi authorities, as suggested in the case of the airway beacon in paragraph 9 above. 13. The readiness of the Saudi Government to grant any of the desired facilities will doubtless turn largely on the amount of financial inducement they receive. His Majesty’s Government are prepared, in the particular circum stances prevailing in Saudi Arabia, to agree that payment should be made for any facilities accorded, although these are of a nature which other countries would normally provide without charge. At the same time, in view of the very limited use to which the facilities—apart from the airway beacon—would be put, they consider that the amount of compensation should be kept on a modest plane, and below the figure of £3,000 a year previously proposed as a maximum offer. For your own information, the question is, moreover, complicated by the possibility of payment being made by means of a remission of the Saudi debt due to His Majesty’s Government; and, before this possibility can be explored, it will be necessary to learn the intentions of the Saudi Government in regard to the repayment of the outstanding balance of that debt. It will, therefore, be preferable for you to avoid any discussion of the financial aspect at the present stage and until you receive further instructions. If questioned on the subject you may indicate the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to make a small annual payment, but you should explain that they will require to know how many of the desired facilities the Saudi Government will be prepared to grant before they can make any concrete offer. 14. In the event of your negotiations being successful, you may propose to the Saudi Government that the agreement should be recorded in an exchange of notes to be operative for five years and terminable thereafter at six months’ notice.

July 8, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 4207/1217/25] Fuad Bey Hamza to Mr. Rendel.—(Received July 8.) My dear Mr. Rendel, Saudi Arabian Legation, London, July 6, 1935. SINCE I received your letter dated the 27th June, 1935, on the subject of aircraft on the Hasa coast, I have been in correspondence with the proper authorities in His Majesty’s Government; and now I am in a position to com municate to you my observations on the points raised by you. 2. I consider that it is above all things essential to separate the negotiations regarding permission for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force from those relating to permission for the machines of Imperial Airways. The negotiations relating to permission for the latter must be on the customary lines adopted in the case of other commercial companies. And my Government is prepared at all times to meet the representatives of Imperial Airways and to discuss with them the most satisfactory method of giving effect to their requirements. Our own discussions, however, must be limited to the aircraft belonging to the Royal Air Force. 3. I consider it essential that permission for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force should be in accordance with a clear agreement in the form of a contract or convention for a fixed period, in which should be set forth in detail the matters which may or may not be undertaken. It is, in my opinion, exceedingly difficult, and, indeed, contrary to our interests to grant a general unconditional permission, however simple or easy the services to be rendered may be. 4. And similarly I consider that it is impossible for His Majesty’s Govern ment to grant permission in any form whatever for the enjoyment of rights over its territories or waters without consideration. It is essential therefore that provision should be included in the convention for a fixed annual payment. 5. And further I have been informed that His Majesty’s Government is unable to agree that the Royal Air Force should undertake operations in the matter of the working out or repairing of landing-grounds or the setting up of a beacon. They regard therefore as essential that all such works should be under taken by themselves on the basis of plans, in accordance with which the carrying out of such works is required. It is therefore desirable to specify within the terms of the proposed convention both the works to be undertaken and the intervals of time to be prescribed for their inspection and repair. 6 I wish to explain to you that these are the preliminary considerations which have been adopted by my Government and that they are for the safe guarding of the permanent interests of both parties as well as for the avoidance of any possible misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the future.

IQ'-’ n j _ J ti Section 2. [E 3947/1217/23] Record of the Second Part of the Second Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on June 25, 1935. [Note. —The first part of this meeting, which is recorded separately, was taken up by resumed discussion of the question of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia.] THE second part of the meeting was devoted to explanation and discussion of certain facilities desired by the Air Ministry on the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia. The following were present:— Mr. Rendel. Sir A. Ryan. Mr. Ward. Fuad Bey Hamza (Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Minister in London). Mr. RENDEL recalled that the question of facilities for British aircraft on passage between Koweit and Bahrein on the Hasa coast had formed the subject of negotiations with the Saudi Government on previous occasions. It had not been possible, however, to reach agreement in the matter, and he thought this was primarily due to the nervousness of the Saudi Government lest the extensive facilities desired at that time might amount to foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. Moreover, it had not been possible to reach agreement on the financial aspect. However, recent improvements in the range and reliability of aircraft had now greatly reduced the risk of forced landings on Saudi territory. This had enabled the Air Ministry to reduce very considerably their original list of desiderata, which in their present form could not possibly be held to constitute interference in Saudi affairs and would involve the Saudi Government in no expenditure. Mr. Rendel then explained to Fuad Bey in detail the present requirements of the Air Ministry, as set out in the Air Ministry letter of the 20th February to the Foreign Office, as revised at the inter-departmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on the 24th June. FUAD BEY replied that King Abdul Aziz had already shown his desire to help progress in aviation in the Persian Gulf. At the same time Saudi Arabia was not yet in a position to profit by reciprocity in such matters, and so King Abdul Aziz could not be expected to incur any expense in providing air facilities for other countries. But he could say that the Saudi Government would not have any objection in principle to granting the facilities mentioned by Mr. Rendel, subject to the following conditions :— (a) The sovereign rights of King Abdul Aziz and his successors would have to be respected and the facilities should be given in such a way as to avoid any appearance of foreign interference in the affairs of Saudi Arabia. (h) A guarantee should be given that facilities would not be used in the future so as to infringe Saudi sovereign rights. (c) The Saudi Government should not be put to expense of any sort through the grant of the facilities. (d) The question of the facilities required for the Royal Air Force should be kept distinct from that of those required for the aircraft of British civil air services, and the two sets of facilities should be dealt with separately. Fuad Bey added that, while facilities for the Royal Air force could be granted by means of a diplomatic exchange of notes, the Saudi Government would prefer to negotiate direct with Imperial Airways (Limited) in regard to facilities for their aircraft. [431 bb—2]2 Mr. RENDEL expressed gratification at Fuad Bey’s statement that the Saudi Government would be ready, in 'principle, to grant the desired facilities, and thought that there would certainly be no difficulty in recognising the first three out of the four reservations that Fuad Bey had just mentioned. He considered, however, that it would be unnecessary to make any distinction between facilities for the Royal Air Force and for British commercial aircraft on regular services (which amounted in practice to Imperial Airways (Limited)). As Fuad Bey was aware, Imperial Airways were closely connected with His Majesty’s Government by reason of the subsidy which they received; moreover, the Air Ministry had charge equally of military and civil aviation, and, in matters connected with the organisation of the air route in the Persian Gulf, no distinction was made between the two branches. In any case, it would be necessarv for negotiations about facilities for civil aircraft as well as those for the Royal Air Force to be conducted through the Foreign Office. After further discussion it was agreed that Mr. Rendel should write a letter to Fuad Bey setting out the exact nature of the Air Ministry desiderata and recording his understanding of the attitude of the Saudi Government in the matter as explained by Fuad Bey earlier in the meeting. Fuad Bey would reply to this letter, and the question would be reconsidered by both parties in the light of the discussion which had taken place with a view to a further meeting on the subject in due coursq. A copy of the letter which Mr. Rendel subsequently wrote to Fuad Bey, in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon at the meeting, and after the text had been concurred in by the Air Ministry, is attached. June 25, 1935. My dear Fuad Bey, Foreign Office, June 27, 1935. As arranged at our meeting on the morning of the 25th June, I write to confirm my oral statement of the revised desiderata of our Air Ministry as regards facilities for the aircraft of the Royal Air Force and of regular British air services flying along the air route on the south-western shore of the Persian Gulf between Koweit and Bahrein. These desiderata are as follows :— (1) The aircraft of the Royal Air Force and of Imperial Airways proceeding between Koweit and Bahrein are at present obliged to fly outside Saudi territorial waters on the Hasa Coast. Although the range and reliability of aircraft have greatly increased in recent years, flying for long periods over the open sea with no possibility of making a landing in case of engine failure or other accident imposes a severe strain upon pilots and greatly increases the danger of a mishap proving disastrous. Accordingly, in order that this risk may be reduced as far as possible, and the margin of safety increased, the Air Ministry are anxious that permission may be given for the Royal Air Force and for British civil aircraft of regular commercial services to fly down the Hasa coast within Saucji territorial waters, and within gliding distance of the land, so as fo be able to reach the land in the event of a forced landing proving unavoidable. The proximity to the land at which aircraft would be obliged to fly in order to reach safety in case of necessity would, of course, depend upon the height at which they were operating; but every effort would be made to avoid actually flying over the land itself. With the constant improvements taking place in aircraft construction, it is anticipated that forced landings will become increasingly rare. (2) Although recent improvements in the range and reliability of aircraft have greatly reduced the risk of forced landings, they cannot yet be excluded as impossible, and since it is essential, in view of the barren and sparsely populated nature of much of the coast, for relief to be brought to the crews without delay, the Air Ministry would be grateful for a general permission to send the necessary minimum of assistance to any machine which has been compelled to land. Such permission would, of course, be subject to immediate notification of the action taken being given to the Saudi Government. Assistance would normally be despatched by means of other aircraft, but in the case of machines forced down near the Koweiti frontier, or on the coast of the mainland or one of the islands in the Persian Gulf, it might be preferable to despatch motor vehicles or a vessel.3 I he Air Ministry accordingly hope that it may be possible for discretion to be left to the authorities on the spot to use the most suitable means of transport at their disposal for the rescue of stranded machines. (3) In order to add to the safety of air travel along the Hasa coast, the Air Ministry are anxious that a minimum number of landing grounds may be avail able for use in emergency by the Royal Air Force and the aircraft of British regular civil air services. They would accordingly be most grateful if the landing grounds that are understood already to exist at Jinnah, Qatif (Darin) and Ras-as-Safaniyah might be made available for this purpose. There would, of course, be no question of such an arrangement involving any expense on the Saudi Government or any obligation to maintain guards, &amp;c., or of its implying any derogation to the full sovereignty of King Abdul Aziz over the landing grounds; and I should emphasise that we are only asking for permission to use them in emergencies in accordance with normal international custom, which, on the analogy of ships in distress at sea, allows special facilities to aircraft forced down by bad weather or engine failure. Nor would there be any question of permanent facilities (such as petrol stores) being required at the landing grounds. As I explained to you on the 25th June, the only attention which the landing grounds would require would be the marking out in white of the corners and centre of the landing space and possibly some preliminary levelling. Subse quently, inspection and fresh markings might be necessary once or twice a year. The Saudi Government may prefer to execute this small amount of necessary work themselves, but I am authorised to inform your Excellency that the Royal Air Force will be glad to carry it out at their own expense, but on behalf of the Saudi Government, and also to undertake the necessary work of maintenance by sending an aircraft periodically to the landing grounds with the necessary personnel and stores, if the Saudi Government consider this course preferable. (4) The Air Ministry would be very grateful if they might be accorded permission to establish on Jinnah Island an airway automatic light beacon for the guidance of aircraft flying down the Hasa coast by night. This beacon would be of use to all other aeroplanes operating in the Persian Gulf and also to shipping; but as the party principally interested in flying in this region, the Air Ministry would be prepared to install and maintain the beacon at their own expense. The beacon would be of solid construction and would not require guarding; it would be constructed to consume either gas or electricity, and would require attention and refuelling at intervals of two to three months. The necessary maintenance could, as was suggested in the case of the landing grounds, be performed by periodical visits of a Royal Air Force machine. 2. The Air Ministry have also expressed the hope that the Saudi Govern ment might at some future date be willing to co-operate with the proposed central weather ^forecasting station in the Persian Gulf by furnishing daily weather reports through their wireless stations at Riyadh or on the Hasa coast. Such reports would be of the greatest assistance to aircraft of all nations, and would materially lessen the risk of aircraft being forced down on the Hasa coast by bad weather; but their provision is not a matter of urgency, since the central forecasting station (which will probably be established at Basra) is unlikely to be in operation for some time. 3. I understood you to say that you did not think that the Saudi Govern ment would have any objection in principle to granting the above facilities, subject to the following reservations (a) The sovereign rights of King Abdul Aziz and his successors would have to be respected, and the facilities should be given in such a way as to avoid any appearance of foreign interference in the affairs of Saudi Arabia. (b) A guarantee should be given that the facilities would not be used in the future to infringe Saudi sovereign rights. (c) The Saudi Government should not be put to expense of any sort through the grant of the facilities. (d) The question of the facilities required for the Roval Air Force should be kept distinct from that of those required for the aircraft of British civil air services, and the two sets of facilities should be dealt with separately.You will remember, however, that I pointed out the close interdependence of the two services in this part of the world, and explained that in either case the matter would have to be dealt with through the Foreign Office. 4. I shall be grateful if your Excellency will inform me whether I have correctly represented the views you expressed, and, if so, to have your further views regarding the particular desiderata indicated in the earlier paragraphs of this letter. I am in communication with the Air Ministry regarding various technical details, and would suggest that we might usefully have a further discussion of the matter before you leave London.

Description of Enclosure?. Name and Date. Subject.An inter-departmental meeting was held in Mr. Hendel'e room at the Foreign Office on the 24th June to consider the line to be taken in discussing with the Saadi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affaire during his present visit to London the questions ofr (1) The air facilities desired by the Air Ministry on the Hasa Coast. (2) The Saudi debt to Hie Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in respect of arms supplied to King Ibn Saud in 1929. The meeting had before it the Air Ministry letter of the 20th February (E 1217/1217/25), containing a revised list of Air Ministry desiderata, and despatch No.141 of the 10th May (E 3299/1217/26) from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda giving his observations thereon. It was invited to consider the possibility of offering the Saudi Government a remission of part of their debt in return for the desired facilities. The following were present at the meeting: Mr. Rendel. Sir Andrew Ryan. Mr. Bridges, Treasury. Wing Commander Pirie. ) ) Air Ministry Squadron Leader Russell ) Mr. Crombie, India Office. Mr. Ward. It was agreed after discussion that the two subjects should/should be kept separate in the preliminary negotiations with Fuad Bey Hamzat and that when they had both been broached and the attitude of the Saudi Government ascertained, a further inter-departmental meeting should be held to explore the possibility of using an offer of remission of debt as a bargaining counter for the desired facilities. The meeting then considered in detail the manner in which the two questions should be put to Fuad Bey Hamza and came to the following conclusions (l) Air facilities . The revised desiderata of the Air Ministry, as contained in the sub-paragraphs numbered (l) to (4) in Air Ministry letter of the 20th February and set out for convenience of reference in an appendix to this record, should be communicated to the Saudi Deputy Minister subject to the following amendments and additions: (a) the wording of desideratum (l) to be changed at the discretion of the Foreign Office negotiators so as to make it clear that permission was only being sought to fly over the territorial waters on the Hasa coast and that aircraft would not normally come in over the land. (b) The wording of desideratum (8) to be modified, to avoid arousing unjustified suspicions, so as to refer to the 'necessary minimum' of assistance being sent to stranded aircraft. The explanation to be added that such assistance would normally be sent by air, but that special circumstances might render cars or vessels more appropriate. It should also be explained that payment would be made for all expenses incurred by the Saudi authorities/authorities through forced landings of British aircraft, (c) Desideratum (3) to he communicated in the first place in its original form, hut the Foreign Office to have discretion if necessary to reduce the requested facilities to the use of the landing ground on Jinnah island only, (It was also agreed that His Majesty’s Government could not resist the use hy the aircraft of other countries of any facilities acquired under this head), (d) Desideratum (4) to he communicated in its original form, hut no rent to he offered to the Saudi Government in the first instance, (e) The question of weather reports from the Saudi wireless station at Riyadh (paragraph 9 of Air Ministry letter of the 20th February) should he mentioned as well, hut it should he made clear that these were not required immediately since the proposed central forecasting station would not he ready for a year or more. It was agreed that the question of payment for any of these facilities should not he raised with the Saudi Government at all at the preliminary meeting, and that the facilities should he requested on the grounds of international custom and in the interests of the safety of human life. (2) Debt of the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India, Fuad Bey Hamza should he reminded of the amount of the debt (90%) still outstanding and questioned as to the period/I ■period in which the Saudi (tovernment proposed to arrange for the complete repayment of the debt* Mr. Bridges statea that the Treasury would probably agree not to insist upon interest if repayment of the capital of the debt could be arranged over the next few years: at the same time they considered that it offered a useful bargaining counter, which should be kept in reserve, as an inducement to punctual re-payment of the capital. It was accordingly decided that it might be indicated to Fuad Bey that His Majesty's Government would view sympathetically the question of interest provided that satisfactory arrangements were made for the complete repayment of the whole capital of the debt by regular instalments within a period of a few years. It was agreed that in view of the decision not to link up the Saudi debt with the request for air facilities in the first instance, it would not be necessary at present to consider the claim of the Government of India to repayment by His Majesty's Government of their one-third share of the total debt in the event of any part of the debt being remitted in return for air facilities of an 'Imperial' nature.Appendix * Extract from Air Ministry letter to Foreign Office of the 20th February, 1935 (Foreign Office reference E 1217/1217/2J7 'The Council therefore suggest that Sir Andrew Ryan 'should put this point of view before Ibn Baud and suggest to 'him that on humanitarian grounds and in accordance with 'normal international practice that:- '(i) he should grant permission for aircraft belonging 'to British regular civil air serviceS'and the 'Royal Air Force to fly within gliding distance 'of the Hasa Coast whilst on passage between Koweit 'and Bahrein.

I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 43 of the 31st January regarding the negotiations now proceeding between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government, and I have duly noted that, while I am to take any opportunity of endeavouring to secure the desiderata of the Air Ministry in connexion with landing grounds on the Hasa coast. I am to await a revised list of those desiderata before taking action. As the proposal for a comprehensive settlement of major outstanding questions has now been abandoned, it is not urgent that I should broach the question with the Saudi Government, but you will remember that they themselves expressed anxiety some little time ago to*^ clear up the position in regard to unauthorised landings and flying-over. 2. As regards paragraphs 3 and 4 of your despatch under reference, F would observe that, 'while the question of the debts of the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Government in the I nited Kingdom and the Government of India has not been strongly pressed since the end of 1933, it has been kept quite alive. I spoke about it very pointedly to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin early in last July. The attention of Fuad Bey Hamza was again drawn to it during his visit to London in September. I again mentioned it on the 20th January, when enumerating the subjects to be considered in connexion with the present negotiations. ’ 3. There is as little prospect as ever of obtaining an early cash settlement of the debts in question. So far as I can judge, mere postponement could not be used as a lever to obtain any countervailing concession on the Saudi side, but an offer of some important abatement or total remission of the debts might be used to secure reasonable desiderata in connexion with landing grounds. I shall be able to judge of this possibility better when I know what these desiderata are. but I may observe generally that the offer could only be made usefully as part of a business transaction and not to secure any concession to which political significance might be attached.

I have no objection to your reverting to separate simultaneous settlement of outstanding points as suggested in paragraph 9 of your telegram. In that case, however, you will no doubt consider possibility of following up suggestion you yourself made at end of Middle East Official Sub-Committee meeting of November 8th that discussion of Kcweit blockade question should bo taken first 0 2* Paragraphs 2-5 of your telegram. It is, I suppose, possible that Ibn Saud may be allowing Fuad his head in order to see how much he can extract from His Majesty’s Government but that if His Majesty’s Government react violently Ibn Baud will tighten rein. In any case it must be made clear to Saudi Government once for all that His Majesty's Government will not abandon their established policy in the Persian Gulf in order that Ibn Saud may play with greater effect to the pan-Arab gallery, of whose intelligence they hold the same estimate as Fuad. If the King serious ly intends to press this point negotiations on frontier question will not be possible, and a serious question affecting ...2 affecting Anglo-Saudi relations as a whole will arise* It is therefore essential to disabuse Fuad on this point without delay* 3. I approve generally your language to Fuad on this question c His queries recorded in paragraph 4 (d) of the enclosure in your despatch No, 17 (of the 22nd January) were impertinent. If he should again allude to promise given to King Hussein (I assume he refers to McMahon-Hussein correspondence) short answer is that in that correspondence His Majesty’s Government expressly reserved their rights under their treaties with Arab rulers of Persian Gulf. These treaties have been officially communicated to Saudi Government. 4, While speaking generally in the above sense with whatever degree of firmness you consider necessary to drive home the main point, viz. refusal of His Majesty’s Government to be exploited in the Pan-Arab interest* you may see fit to add that for their own part, as Ibn Saud is aware, His Majesty's Government have constantly been at pains to promote good relations between Arab States, It is for this reason that they attach particular importance to question of Koweit blockade, settlement of which they hope to negotiate with Saudi Government even if general negotiations are abandoned.

'ZI&lt;1'3^. CPZ-trtCrf?^) . In conclusion, Mr. Rendel mentioned that His Majesty’s Government might wish, in the course of any general negotiations, to revive the question of the passage of aircraft over Saudi Arabia. The question, which had often been discussed before, was, in one sense, one of diminishing importance, since the actual extent of the Saudi coastline on the Persian Gulf was small and the radius and reliability of aircraft were steadily increasing. It was, of course, against the policy of His Majesty’s Government to make the regular passage of aircraft over any particular country subject to financial payments. It was clear that, once such a principle were established, there would be no end to it, and that freedom of air communications all over the world would be greatly interfered with. But there would be certain advantages if some agreement could be come to with a view to facilitating the passage of aircraft over King Ibn Baud’s territory. The question of dealing with the matter in connexion with the proposed general settlement had not yet been fully considered, but Mr. Rendel thought it well to make it clear at once that His Majesty’s Government might eventually wish to raise it, lest, if it were left over and only mentioned later, they should be regarded as endeavouring at the last moment to include new subjects in the general settlement and thereby altering its scope.(3) Arabian Air Route. , Q1 J urther e^ts si nc e February 1932 to obtain certain facilities from Ibn -^aud in respect of the Hasa Coast ended last year in a deadlock. Ibn Saud was preparedin principle to grant the facilities, but on exorbitant money terms. The ^l S M ^ est y s Government was prepared to pay was not such as could possible attract a ruler so jealous of his sovereign rights. We have been iwng from hand to mouth, reducing what are technically violations of his territory by forced landings and flying over to a minimum and apologising for them before the feaudi Government have time to protest. This has worked well enough in the conditions of the last year, as it has not suited Ibn Saud to be sticky with His Majesty s Government over small matters. He cannot, however count indefinitely on his continued complaisance. (vi) The understanding might bind Ibn Saud to give reasonable facilities for landing in and flying over the coastal strip of Hasa in case of need, subject to an undertaking not to fly inland without special sanction from Ibn Saud and to payment of a reasonable annual rent, in recognition of Ibn Saud’s sovereign rights. If the understanding were for fifteen or twenty years, this rent might possibly be met in anticipation by a remission of the Saudi Government debts to His Majesty's Government^Ai r M ai 1. \HD£^ e£&gt; No.F. 7-N/34.

The necessary steps will be t&amp; en to ensure that violations of baudi-Arabian territory and territorial waters on the Hasa coast arc reduced to a minimum and to occasions of necessity. Tie considerations to which attention ha© been drawn will be impressed on tie Foyal Air Force personnel con cerned, on Imperial Airways, anu the pilots of any other British civil aircraft permitted to use this route. Instruction© will be issued that ail case© of flight over Saudi territory or territorial waters or of forced landing are to be reported immediately to Hie Majesty 1 ** Sabasay in 'Iraq to enable Hie Majesty’s Legation at Jedda to be informed without delay for the purpose of tendering an apology before the Saudi authorities have time to‘lodge a protest. 3. The Air Council agree that the only defence that Hia Majesty’s Government can max a in cases of violation of Saudi territory or territorial waters by British aircraft mu^t be based on general international practice in this matter, and fully concur in the statement oi international principle and practice contained in paragraph 5 of the letter under reply. In the oas 3 of civil aircraft, the claim to lenient treatment is reinforced by the fact that the practice of permitting innocent passage la adopted by almost all states. The view put forward in paragraph 6, however, raises a question of considerable difficulty. The Council realise the force of The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. T .T.O.Sir John Simon's argument, but as the use of the air route lii the neighbourhood of the Hasa coast is imperative, acceptance 01 the principle that the proximity of a prohibited area should be avoided because of the risi. oi invading the area itself would very seriously embarrass them not only in this instance, but in others. The;y ti erefore trust that every endeavour will be made to avoid discussion of this issue, and that if it has to be met it will not be admitted that the claim to lenient treatment is in ary way lessened by the fact that the air route runs close to prohibited territory. 4. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Ofiice with a request that the necessary orders may be issued through the Air Officer Comnumding, Royal Air Force, India.

Consequent upon the review of this situation, the foreign Office have requested that in all oases where aircraft are forced to tafce shelter within Saudi territorial waters or fly over or land on Saudi tsrritory the matter will be reported Immediately to Hie Majesty^ Sabasey In Iraq to enable His Majesty's Legation at Jedda to be informed without delay for the purpose of tendering an apology before the Saudi authorities have time to lod^e a protest. 3. I am to request that you will tabs all feaslbls steps to reduce to a minimum all possibility of avoidable trespass within Saudi territory. it might well be claimed, for instance, by the Saudi authorities that air craft forced to land within Saudi territory by sandstorms or adverse weather should not have been despatched on the route under conditions likely to Induce such trespass. 133 ^ 73 December 1933, fhe Air Officer Commanding, Air Headquarters, Iraq Command, Hinaidi, Iraq.

The F.O. have now had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Sir Andrew Ryan who considers that the Saudi Government are extremely unlikely to accept the proposals put to them by H.M.G. unless they are approached at a moment when they are so pressed for money that the relatively small amount which H.M.G. are prepared to offer is sufficient to tempt them, or when, for political reasons, they are particularly anxious to find favour with H.M.G.

The Air Ministry emphasise, however, that it is essential that Service Civil Aircraft should continue to use the Arab Coast Route in transit with cr without the permission of the Saudi Government, and they assume that H.M.G. will be prepared to meet any possible complaints which may arise from time to time owing to unavoidable infringement of Saudi territory and territorial waters. The Air Ministry add that they will be glad of Sir A.Ryan 1 s personal opinion as to the sum necessary to secure the facilities required, though of course no suggestion could be made to the Saudis that would be prepared to pay more than the £3000 already authorised.

He asked me to disregard the short preamble, which had been written while the principle of entering into an agreement was still under discussion. He explained that his Bovemment were now definitely prepared to make an agreement on the terms set forth in the numbered paragraphs# He also explained that the reference to Has Tanura meant that there would be no objection to a landing ground on the mainland near tiiat place. 2 # I discussed the memorandum in a general way with Fuad Bey on July 2# I pointed out that the actual text of his memorandum was not clear as regards Ras Tanura and might mean that anisland near that place could be used. I‘\iad Bey confirmed what he had previously told me and spoke as though the landing ground on the mainland need not be in the immediate vicinity but might be as far away even as Jubaii. I understood him to say also that other islands might be available besides Jennah. 3# I observed that the memorandum was silent as regards some of t e proposals very clearly stated in para. 3 of the memorandum forwarded by Mr# Hope Gill on December /13 The Night Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.G*S.I# t K.C.V.O., etc#, etc., etc. etc.13, notably the 2nd. , the 3rd and the 4th. Faad Bey Intimated rather airily that none of these would be difficult of acceptance if the two Governments came to terras. 4. I suggested that the financial terras proposed by the Sa^di Govemraent were extortionate, as they wanted Hia Majesty’s Government to pay all expenses and a rent of £.5000 gold for each landing ground as well* ; hiad Bey expressed the view that as the Sa'ddi Government had no motives of their own for creating a system of landing grounds, it was reasonable that His Majesty’s Government should bear any expense entailed and that it was equally reasonable to ask a rent of £.5000 for 'valuable portions of our territory. * I may mention in thb* connexion that in our first conversation he had suggested that we were asking for six installations via., three landing grounds and three sea plane anchorages. He did not revert to this suggestion on July 2, nor did I, but it will have to be borne in mind if we warn ever get as far as making a bargain on a basis of rent for unit. 5. fhiad Bey remarked towards the end of the conversation that the proposals were on the lines of his discussion with Group Captain Peirse in May of last year. I refrained from comment. My object in engaging as far as I did in discussion of the Sa’ddi communication was merely to elucidate it before submitting so unsatlsfacory a reply for your consideration, As I shall have lef Jedda before I can hear your views, you will doubtless wish to instruct Mr. Calvert in due course as to what the next step shouj be. I have the honour to be with the highest respect. Sir, Your most obedientMEMORANDUM. The Government of His Majesty the King see the following in case of agreement upon the construction air stations on the coast of al Hasa !♦ The necessary areas can not be (granted) except on the islands and not on the mainland, and we can say that they may be on Jinna Island, and near Has Tanura. 2. Expenditure on construction of aerodromes and buildings for officials who will occupy them ahould be borne by the British Government. 3. The British Government must pay a yearly rent of five thousand English gold pounds for each aerodrome. 4* The Government (applying) must bear the expense of officials and soldiers necessary as guards. 5. If aeroplanes should land they should not use their wireless but should use the wireless of the Government. 6. When landing they should observe local regulations in force relative to customs, health, police and the like. 7. The duration of the agreement is five years. 8. *ny dispute arising in respect of any question concerning the agreement should be settled by arbitration.VI JIC.3.W.

Rendel The Secretary of the Air Ministrycr^ British Legation, Jedda. 10th April, 1933* Sir, With reference to previous correspondence ending with my telegram No.23 of February 7, relative to violations of Sa*udi territory by British aircraft, I have the honour to 2 enclose copies of a telegram which I received late on March 31 from the Political Agent at Bahrain and of a note which I handed next morning to Fuad Bey Hamza. I informed the Political Agent by telegraph on April 1st that I- had taicen action and I received two furthestelegrams from him dated April 1 and 2 in which he informed me of the arrival of the Hanno at Bahrain and asked me to convey to the Sa'udi Government the thanks of the captain of the Hanno and his own for the assistance and kindness of the local authorities at Jubail. 2. The Political Agent’s telegram was brought to me after 8 p.m. on March 31, when I was leaving Fuad Bey. He explained that he would not communicate that evening with the King who was giving his annual pilgrimage dinner. When I again saw Fuad Bey on April 1 he told me that a report had been received from the Governor of Hasa to the effect that first aid was being rendered to the Hanno. He added that when she had been got free of the mud further action would be considered. He expressed perturbation at the recurrence of such violations of Sa’udi territory. I 3. I reminded Fuad Bey that I had had no reply to Mr. Hope Gill’s note of December 13 forwarding His Majesty’s Government’s considered proposals regarding landing grounds on the Hasa Coast. I observed that, while His Majesty's Government The Right Honourable, Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O., etc., etc., etc.Government did not contemplate the normal use of the proposed landing grounds 'by other than service aircraft, they had adverted to the possibility of occasional forced landings by aircraft belonging to Imperial Airways. Fuad Bey said that the King had intimated a wish to postpone final considerations of the proposals of His Majesty’s Government until his return to the Hejaz and that he, Fuad Bey, hoped to pursue the matter with me soon after the Pilgrimage. 4. Although I put the best face I could on the Hanno affair, I think that the position in regard to flying over and forced landings by Imperial Airways machines in Sa’udi territory requires reconsideration. In your telegram No.154 of December 7 it was stated that the Air Ministry considered the likelihood of forced landings to be extremely remote. It has since appeared (See your telegram No.11 of January 19) that a technical violation of territory by flying over took place on November 27, and the Sa’udi Government have alleged the two further instances of flying over by British aircraft on January 25 and February 3 mentioned in my telegram under reference. Even if these should prove not to have taken place or not to have been made by Imperial Airways, machines, we have now had two clear cases of violation of territory in six months. I doubt whether forced landings can still be considered improbable as aircraft which goes astray may easily have to alight and a landing was actually forced on the Hanno. 5. The Sa’udi Government are doubtless unduly jealous but they are what they are for better of worse. Nothing indisposes them so much as apparent indifference to their t sovereign rights. I have received no reply as yet to my note of April 1 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, probably because of the interruption of all business owing to the pilgrimage and the ensuing festival during the week ending April 8. It is quite possible, however, that I may at any moment receive a replyreply embodying a protest* In these circumstances and as I had already on April 1 thanked Fuad Bey on my own account for what was Being done at Jubail, I preferred to await a personal interview with Fuad Bey to express the thanks which the Political Agent at Bahrain has asked me to convey to the Sa ? udi Government. 6 . As I have said, I think the question of the position vis-a-vis of the Sa*udi Government in regard to flying over By non-service aircraft and forced landings like that of the Hanno requires reconsideration. If you share this view, it will doubtless continue to Be linked with that of emergency landing grounds for service aircraft, which Fuad Bey has promised to discuss with me further. I do not wish to anticipate the results of such discussion But I take this opportunity of drawing attention to what appears to me to Be an unfortunate feature in the list of landing grounds on the Arabian coast in paragraph 112 of the Royal Air Force Monthly Intelligence Summary for f Iraq for January. The list shows as Being ^available” although 'to Be used only in extreme emergency” four landing grounds Between Kuwait and Bahrain. It seems to me that the caution given does not maice it sufficiently clear that the use of these grounds, or at any rate of three of them (one appears to Be in the Kuwait neutral zone) at present involves a violation of Sa T udi territory. I trust that, although this does not appear from the list, it has Been explained to the pilots concerned. 7.

Air Ministiy consider likelihood of Imperial Airways machines having to land on the Hasa Coast extremely remote. In improbable event of forced landing being necessary, it might have to be made on first available spot. 2. You should therefore proceed with action on my despatch No. 357 (of the 26th October). But to safeguard position of Imperial Airways and to meet possible Saudi suspicions, you should in addition explain that same facilities are not required for Company’s as for service aircraft since owing to their four engines and Company’s policy of avoiding undue risks, it is unlikely that they will have to make a forced landing on the Hasa Coast; but that His Majesty’s Government foel sure that in such improbable event they could rely on the humanity of the Saudi Government to do their best to secure the safety of the aircraft concerned and to allow the necessary help to be sent. 3.

You will see that Hope Qill is in some doubt whether we shall not eventually have to seek for civil aircraft the same facilities and the same permission as we are now planning to obtain for military aircraft. In that case, he asks, would it not be wiser to make both our demands at once rather than seem to be disguising the full extent of our designs by asking only one thing at a time? 3.

Now that Imperial Airways are regularly operating the Arabian coast route, I think that it would be well to re-examine the question in the light of Hope Oill* s telegram. 4. If, as the Air Ministry have always maintained, there is really only a very remote likelihood that the Imperial Airways aircraft operating the Arabian route will at any time be forced to land in Ibn 3aud’s territory, the point might perhaps be covered by Hope Gill saying something to the Caudi Government to the effect that it is unnecessary for us to request the same facilities for Imperial Airways, as owing to their four engines, ana to the/1# [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] From SAUDI -ARABIA, :&gt; ( j c {r o Decypher, D, R, No.200, Ko;'0 so Charge a E Affaires ?

(E 6218/670/91). / AIR MINISTRY, 0 G-wydyr House, Whitehall, -O London, S.W.l 15th Decemher, 1931 Dear Rendel, With reference to your letter of the 11th instant, I have spoken to Mr. Woods Humphrey and I do not really think that the position is altered by Imperial Airways’ new proposal to use landplanes as far as Bahrein if they have to operate the Arabian Coast route. to Bahrein, using Koweit as an emergency refuelling station. If they make the change over from landplanes to segglanes at Bahrein instead of at Basrah, the landplanes would follow exactly the same route and fly outside the three mile limit from Basrah to Bahrein with a possible stop for refuelling at Koweit. Sard’s territory and would only land on it in case of a real emergency. In the case of a seaplane, the emergency landing would presumably be made on the shore, while in the case of a landplane the landing would be made on land near the coast. In these circumstances I think that you will agree that so far as flying over Ibn Baud’s territory is concerned, the position is exactly the same in the two cases, and that it is no more necessary to ask his permission in the case of a landplan.e service from Basrah to Bahrein than it was in the case of a seaplane service. With seaplanes the proposal was to fly from Basrah In neither case would the aircraft fly over Ibn G-.W. Rendel, Esq., Yours sincerely, (Signed) The. Bertram.

At what figure the maximum sum to be offered to Ibn Baud in this connxion should be fixed is, we think, primarily a matter for the Air Ministry and Treasury.

A.0«0. Iraq*s letter of 19th July certainly goes further than anything we discussed with Fuad Bey Hamza in one particular respect, namely, that it includes civil aviation. As I think you are already aware. Imperial .air ways have disclaimed any interest in facilities on the Hasa coast and also, as you quite rightly say, it is a principle of our policy not to offer t6 pay a foreign state for permission to fly through the air over that state so far as civil aircraft are concerned. With Military aircraft it is a different matter, as the regular use of foreign territory by them would represent a special privilege for which we should have to pay in the case of those more backward states who would be in any degree likely to concede the privilege. * However, both these points are in favour of excluding civil aviation from our requirements, which should be considerably simplified by the omission. Incidentally, you will remember how keen Fuad Bey was in keeping military and civil aviation distinct. How about flying over and along the coast. T .?e entirely agree that it would be a waste of time to put this up as a separate issue. It should follow as a corollary of the new and more comprehensive proposals - incidentally Fuad Bey's own proposals. His own suggestion was that we should have proper landing grounds maintained and guarded by Hejdi personnel at our expense. This mast imply our right to make use of such facilities if and when necessary and the right to inspection periodically to see that the landing grounds are serviceable. Fuad Bey recognised this during our discussion. This being so, th reasons given by the a.O.C. in paragraph 4 of his letter of 19th July are Gr.W. Kendel Esq., Foreign Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.the definite and practical reasons why flying along the coast (not inland) is integral to the general proposal. With regard to cost. I certainly think it would he a pity that, provided Ibn Saud is prepared tc concede our full requirements, negotiations should break down on the sum to be paid. £1,000 seems to us to be a reasonable sum but Ibn Saud knows fi.M.G's capacity to pay and I there fore think we should reserve to ourselves the option of going to a higher figure if necessary. From our point of view I consider that £3,000 would not be unreasonable if we oould thereby secure our full requirements; after all, this is about the cost of one aeroplane, to say nothing of the crew - not a high rate of insurance to pay for valuable lives and aircraft. I imagine, therefor^, that Ibn Saud would in the first place ask us to indicate a figure, which we should give as £1,000; presumably Ryan would then extract a figure from Ibn Saud, whereupon we should come back with our final figure and last word. Incidentally, the only variable throughout the negotiations would be the price, and not the conditions of our requirements. X am sending copies'of this letter to Laithwaite of the India Office, Grieve of the Treasury and Flood of the Colonial Office, and if there is general agfeement to what is now suggested will arrange for a further official letter to be sent modifying the proposals contained in our official letter of the 13th August.

Copies of the letter which was sent to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, and of his reply are enclosed herewith. Sir John Simon will observe that the Air Officer Commanding is of opinion that, unless aircraft are permitted to fly along the coastline so that they may become acquainted with '»• « *. V f' its natural features, the availability of emergency landing grounds would be of little value and without periodical visits of inspection there would be no guarantee that they were being satisfactorily maintained. Although it is true that when the requirements of H.M. Government were discussed between H.M. Minister at Jedda and Puad Bey Hamsa in January last Sir Andrew Ryan explained that his racmest was limited to the occasional use of thfi—landing grounds.• it appears to the Council that the remark of Fuad Bey Hamsa that 'if there were any landing grounds 1 at all there would he a gradually increasing use of them' will afford H.M. Representative an opportunity of restating the desiderata on the lines outlined by the Air Officer Commanding. Moreover # . as stated in the fifth paragraph of Mr, Hendei’s letter, it will be possible to argue that the situation has considerably changed as a result of the conversations which took place with Fuad Bey Hamsa in London The Council will accordingly be glad to learn whether, subject to any observations by the Treasury, to whom a copy of this correspondence is being.sent, Sir John Simon is prepared to authorise H.M. Representative at Jedda to reopen;negotiations on the lines suggested by the Air Officer Commanding. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (signed) J.S. ROSS.165 COP Y 3.25790/3.6. gist June, 1932. Sir, I am commanded *by the Air Council to refer to your telegram 2.194 of 7th May, 1932, and to previous eoramunications on the subject of emergency landing grounds on the Hasa Coast, and to state that, during the recent visit of the Hedjazi-Nejd Mission to this country, a meeting was arranged by the foreign Office in order that Fuad Bey Hamza might personally discuss the proposal with a member of the Air Staff. Air Ministry requirenaents were explained to Fuad Bey Hamza who, in turn, stated the Hedjazi-Nejd point of view; their chief concern in the matter appearing to be of a financial nature. 2!he view of this department has hitherto been that an annual rental of £50 a year for each landing ground would be sufficient to secure a recognition of our right to make use of them in emergency. In the light of the discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza, it is now clear, however, that a more substantial sum will have to be offered if the required landing facilities are to be made available. It is, moreover, possible that if the sum offered were sufficiently attractive Ibn Baud would be prepared to concede not only the right to make use of the landing grounds in emergency, but also the right to fly over the Hasa Coast or the landing grounds in the course of normal passage along the coast, a concession which might be of considerable value. Ihe question whether the proposal is worth pursuing and, if so, what would be a reasonable sum to offer is one on which the Council would be glad to receive your advice and I am accordingly to enclose copies of correspindence and notes regarding the discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza. The Air Officer Commanding, Air Headquarters, Iraq command, Hinaidi, Iraq.You will obeerY* that JFuad Bey states that it would not he sufficient merely to mark out the landing grounds - they would have to he protected and regular arrangements made for ensuring the safety of aircraft using them. Even though such safeguards may not he regarded as essential, they would prohahly haye to he accepted and the cost taken into account in the sum offered. Having regard to the additional security which the existence of the landihg grounds would afford to aircraft flying along the Hasa Coast, the Council would themselves have felt disposed to regard a payment of £1,000 a year in all as justifiable expenditure if the payment embraced the right to fly over this part of Nejdi territory. It is possible, however, that Ihn Saud may have in mind a considerably larger sum - information as to the offer of £3,000 a year to the Sheikh of Sharjah may have come to his knowledge and he might fail to appreciate the fact that Sharjah is to be a regular stopping place where facilities on a considerable scale will be provided. The Council would accordingly be glad to receive your considered opinion as to the real need of the facilities proposed on the Hasa Coast and your suggestion as to the value to be placed upon their acquisition. I am to draw your attention to the view expressed in the third paragraph of Mr. Renders letter to Group Captain Peirse, i.e. that once having stated our terms we should be prepared not to pursue the matter if they are refused. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (signed) J.S. ROSS.By Special Bag COPY Reference: AIR HBADQUARTSRS, 1 IRAQ COMMAND, HINAIDI. 19th July, 1932 sacKao? Sir, I have the honour to refer to Air Ministry letter S.25790/ 3,6 dated 21st June, 1932, on the subject of emergency landing grounds on the HASA Coast, and to state that the proposal to negotiate for certain facilities on a financial basis is, in my opinion, well worth pursuing, 2. It is true that Service (land) aircraft have in the past used this route but seldom. This is due solely to the fact that the route is not yet fully developed. I foresee that flights be made much more frequently in the future for the purpose of route development, inspection of landing grounds, inter-command exercises, and possibly for operational purposes. The desirability of obtain ing facilities is reinforced by the projected regular use of this route by civil aircraft. were originally regarded as inseparable. More recent telegrams emanating from the Foreign Office, however, tend to regard these questions as distinct, and to suggest that we should be content with permission to use landing grounds in emergency, even though this was not combined with permission to fly along the coastline. 4. Under existing circumstances, all aircraft have to proceed outside the three-mile limit. The result of this is that the coastline is M terra incognita”. Should it be necessary to make a landing, due to dust, adverse winds, or mechanical defect, it is extremely doubtful whether this could be safely effected. Even if it were known that emergency landing grounds were available, pilots would be unaware of their position in relation to other topograph!ca3 features, or of their size, shape and pecularitj qs. The Secretary, Air Ministry, Kingsway, London, W.C.2. 3. iSxamination of past correspondence shows that the two questions of: (a) the use of emergency landing grounds on the HASA Coast, and (b) permission to fly along and over the coastal strip itself.5. for these reasons, I consider that permission to use the emergency landing grounds only is of no value by itself and that it should be of 'sine qua non' of the arrangement that permission should be granted for all aircraft, both Service and qjjJXy to fly along the coast- ^ 6 . Landing grounds (if possible, in close proximity to seaplane anchorages) must be selected, prepared, and marked in accordance with technical advice given by Royal Air Force Officers. Furthermore, there must be an assurance that they are kept fit for use. The only practical means of obtaining such an assurance is by periodical inspection by Service aircraft. Without such inspections, there is little doubt that the land ing grounds would fall into disrepair, the markings would be neglected, and the whole arrangement rendered nugatory. 7. Finally, there must be permission to send assistance by air to aircraft in distress either at emergency landing grounds or elsewhere. 0. The requirements can, therefore, be summarized as follow:- (i) Permission for Service and civil aircraft to fly along the coastline at any time. (ii) Selection, preparation, and marking of three landing grounds (and seaplane anchorages) with Royal Air Force advice. (iii) Quarterly inspection of landing grounds by Royal Air Force officers, and maintenance in proper condition in accordance with Royal Air Force advice. (iv) Permission for Service or civil aircraft to use landing grounds or seaplane anchorages in emergency. (v) Permission for Service or civil aircraft to use landing grounds or seaplane anchorages in order to give assistance to other aircraft in distress. 9. For these facilities, I consider that a payment of £750 a year (exclusive of the cost of initial preparation of grounds) would be sufficient, but I agree that this sum should be increased to a maximum of £1,000 a year if found necessary in the course of negotiations. Should it be found impossible to reach agreement on this basis, I suggest that £100 a year should be offered for permission for both Service and civil aircraft to fly along the HASA Coast without the provision of any landing grounds or other facilities. If this offer should be declined, then I suggest that the matter should be dropped. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (signed) C.L.

June 14th f 1932# Ity dear Rendel, M; ny thanks for your letter E 2406/507/25 of hay 23rd regarding emergency landing grounds. I think that paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter to feirse or the same date adequately reflect my view but, ac our conversations were hurried, it may be useful to you to have a considered statement in my own words, as follows:- When I reopened the question in /ay 1951, His Majesty’s Government’s desiderata were stated in the most reduced form possible and they remained in that lorm. throughout all the conversations which I conducted personally up to and including January 24th last (See my despatch No. 55 of January 25th). The matter has since gone through three phases, viz., Biscoe’s conversations with the King and Yftsuf Yftsin; Hope Gill’s interviews with Yflsuf Y&amp;sin, following on the instructions in Foreign Office telegram No. 37 of May 3rd; and your conversations in London. I agree that the last phase supersedes the others and that we are free to make any concrete proposal that we consider fits in with the trend of our conversations. But:- (a) The word Emergency' has dominated all discussions during the last year or so and I think it has always been used in such a way as to suggest that we were thinking Of emergencies G.f. Rendel, Ssqre., Foreign Office.emergencies which would compel our aircraft to deviate from a route normally lying outside Ihn Sa’dd’s territorial waters. If we now mean that t2ie route would normally lie along the line of the landing grounds, although descents on the latter would only take place in conditions of stress we should make it clear that this is our intention. You rightly think that, in my opinion, this will increase the difficulty of the negotiations, hut if we si tply get the grounds; and then assume that we can lay out a route in Ibn Sa*fid’s super-air determined by their position, we shall incur the reproach of having got an inch and trying to take an ell. (b) It must not be assumed that, if we reach no agreement with Ibn Sa’fld, he will be prepared to tolerate, on grounds of hospitality and humanity, occasional landings in conditions of real stress. It is precisely such landings which have given rise to protest in the past. The most that can be hoped is that, if they are very rare and we can rush the news through to him before he receives it otherwise, he will on each occasion make a beau geste of acquiescence and consent to relief being sent. The trouble is that the sending of relief may be too urgent a matter to wait even for the few days necessary to advise him and get his reply. Forgive me for labouring points which I may have already made plain. I am all the more anxious about the matter, as I gather from the recent telegrams that Imperial Airways will probably be using the Arabian route in and after October; and nothing will convince me that they can always make sure, any more than military aircraft, of doing the leap from Kuwait to Bahrain without mishap.

Acting Hejaa- Nejd Minipter for Foreign Affairs* Fuad Bey Hamza having once or twice expressed a desire to have a general talk with me on m5nor outstanding Questions. I arranged to see him at the Foreign Office at 10 a*m* on Wednesday. May 11. prior to his departure for Paris to attend M* Boomer^ funeral* The conversation was of a rather general character, but for convenience of record I will deal with it under separate headings* (1) Emergency landing grounds on the Hasa Coast * We had not proposed to raise this question with the Mission and had in fact instructed Mr* Hope Gill in our telegram No* 27 of May 5 to discuss it in Jedda* The Hejaz- Nejd Minister, however, told me confidentially last night that he had just received a telegram from his Government, informing him of Mr. Hope Gill’s action on our telegram of May 3, and saying that the matter should be discussed by the Mission in London, but adding that the Mission should not take the initiative in raising it* 1 accordingly took the line with Fuad 3ey Hamza that this was one of the minor questions outstanding, and asked him whether he would like to consider it. He then repeated what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had told me previously about the telegram, and said he was quite ready to try to r*ach a settlement, although any agree ment would have to be referred to the King for approval*I explained to Fuad Bey that the matter was not of major Importance, since both military and civil aircraft could now normally fly from Basra or Koweit to Bahrein i without any intermediate halt. Both military and civil aircraft would therefore in the ordinary way fly this stretch without touching Nejdi territory, and aircraft at present using the route had instructions to fly outside territorial waters. At the same time oocasions might easily arise when it would be important to be able to land in an emergency. My impression was that heavy sandstorms occasionally made an emergency landing inevitable, and such ladings might also be necessary in the case of engine trouble, etc. The R.A.F., who at present often flew between Basra and Bahrein in the course of their regular flights, were there fore anxious that if possible three emergency landing grounds should be established on the Hasa Coast, which they, and possibly also civil aircraft, might use in case of need. in reply Fuad Bey gav* me a short and accurate account of the history of this question, and explained that there was now no difficulty of principle in the w ay of the establishment of these landing grounds. On the other hand, the King had to be most careful not to offend the religious susceptibilities of his subjects or to move too fast in the direction of facilitating material developments of this type in a way which might expose him to accusations of being too subservient to non-Moslem interests. Moreover, it would not be sufficient merely to mark out emergency landing grounds; they would have to be protected, and regular arrangements would have to be made to ensure the safety of any aircraft using them. This would all entail expense and it was essential that the King should/should not be out of pooket over any arrang&lt;Maant that was made Moreover, if he gave such facilities to British aircraft he would also have to extend them to the aircraft of other nations. The question now turned almost entirely on the financial factor. If the Air Ministry were prepared to incur the expenditure required for surveying and marking out the aero dromes and paying for the necessary guards, and would pay a suitable rent, he anticipated no difficulty in reaching an agreement. He suggested that we should put forward formal proposals. It was eventually agreed that I should consult the Air Ministry and if possible arrange a meeting between Fuad Bey Hamaa. Group-Captain Peirse and possibly Mr. Bertram of the Air Ministry to discuss terms. I am endeavouring to arrange this. (Signed) G.W. HSND^L. May 11th. 1932.Copy. (E 2406/507/25) Extract. I. O \n ' ; f t -■ Record of Meeting with PUAE BEY HAMZA regarding air matters, held at the Foreign Office at 10.15 a.m. on 13th May. It had 'been arranged that Fuad Bey Hamza should meet Group-Captain Peirse of the Air Ministry for an informal conversation regarding the question of the provision of emergency landing grounds on the Hasa coast. Mr. Rendel, at the beginning of the interview, s aid that it was agreed that the conversation should be informal and without commitment on either side. It was explained to Fuad Bey that the landing grounds contemplated were only required for use in case of emergency, and would almost certainly only be used on rare occasions, and that it was possible that, though primarily useful for military aircraft, they might also later on be of service to Imperial Airways (similarly only in case of emergency). Fuad Bey said that he would prefer for the moment to consider only the case of military aeroplanes, as he had no knowledge of the views of King Abdul Aziz as to that of civil aircraft. Group-Captain Peirse explained what would be involved in the preparation of the landing grounds contemplated. Fuad Bey said that he thought there would be no difficulty about members of the Royal Air Force being present to give technical advice regarding the preparation of the grounds, the work being carried out by local labour but paid for by the British authorities. He also said that guards and officials would be needed at the nthe emergency landing grounds; he thought a personnel of about 20 would he required at each. This would involve expenditure, for which the Hejaz-Nejd Government would require to he reimbursed. A suggestion that payment might reasonably be arranged on the basis of a fee for each emergency landing made was then discussed. Finally, Fuad Bey summed up the financial questions involved as follows:- (1) Reimbursement of expenditure on the preparation of the grounds. (2) Annual payment to cover cost of officials and guards. (3) Possibility of landing fee for each occasion on which use was made of one of the landing grounds. Fuad Bey also said that it would be necessary, in his opinion, that a contract on the subject should be made, which would be terminable by either side after a given period. It was agreed that Group-Captain Peirse should arrange for the points made by Fuad Bey to be considered at the Air Ministry and that thereafter the matter could be taken up again through H.M. Legation at Jedda. (Signed) C.F.A. WARNER. May 13, 1932.\ } &gt; 7 2634 O s 9 . &gt; v/ i (E.2155/73/25J NO DISTRIBUTION . 9 % Code telegram to Mr. Hops Gill (Jedda).

In this connexion I would draw attention to one important point. From Mr.Bertram*e v^V v letter to Mr. Rendel of December 15 it would appear to be assumed at the Air Ministry that no difficulty muld arise, if Imperial Airways normally flew their machines outside territorial waters and landed on Ibn Sa’ld’s territory only in case of real emergency. It is precisely such landings that always give rise to trouble. In the case of service aircraft. Hie Majesty’s Gov' mment have now limited their desiderata to the provision by Ibn ba’&amp;d of facilities for landing and relief, to be taicen advantage of only in case of emergency. It would seem therefore that if Imperial Airways decide to fly from Basra to Bahrain they will have occasion from time to time to use Ibn Sa’dd’s territory in the same way as se vice aircraft. 2. Ibn 8r,’dd’s general situation is now one of some weakness and there have been some recent indications on his part of anxiety to conciliate His ajesty’e Government. I His Me jetty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\ t f V I therefore decided to make a full statement to Fuad Bey on the chance of the King’s being perhaps inclined to adopt a more accommodating attitude as regards landing grounds than he has done in the past. 5. I reminded Fuad Bey of the exchange of views last year* It was unnecessary, I said, to go further back, as the request formulated in my memorandum of Kay 26, 1931 (copy to Foreign Office in my despatch No•212 of June 6) had oeen of a strictly limited character. I explained that my then inetruc* tions covered certain r&gt;ointe which I had preferred not to men tion in my iwemorandum penoing the discussion wnich was to \L follow. His Majesty's Government had expressed a wish that there should be, if possible, three landing grounds about 60 miles apart. They had also su gested that in selecting and marking them out the assistance of the Foyal Air ' orce might be enlisted. I had not mentioned this in the memorandum lest it should arouse suspicion. I would now say that, if ibn Sa’&amp;d agreed in principle to the request of His Majesty's Government, the assistance of the loyal Air Force would be available. The King would have the advantage of expert advice we should have the advantage of knowing that the work had been done by people who knew the requirements; and I could assure the Hejaz-Nejd Government that the offer was made without any intention whatsoever of coking our nosea into their internal affairs. I added that my memorandum had referred both to service and civil aircraft. We were now hos&lt; ver, considering the matter with special reference to facilities, always within the limits indicated, for service aircraft. It was ossible according to my latest information that Imperial Airways would decide on the &gt;aara-Bahrein route, in which case they might occasionally be comoelled to alight in Nejci territory in emergency conditions but nothing hao been decided and my requestrequest, as now renewed, had refer* nee to service aircralt. 4 , I said that the upshot of last year’s negotiations had been that the Hejas-Nejd Government had expressed their in tention of issuing general regulations and haa also in ttuir memorandum of June 18 (copy to Foreign Office in my despatch No.250 of June 28) asked Hie Majesty’s Government to suggest terms on which an agreement might he reached. Nothing furt her had been heard of the regulations. X had not quite underatood the other point hut had surmised that the Kejaz flejd government were thinking of an agreement on a financial oasis and we had looked into the matter from that ooint of view. I was in a position to tell Fuad Bey confidentia ly that the financial arrangements between Imperial Airways and the Persian Government involved moderate payments only although the service maintained along the Persian Coast was one which entailed regular eru ings. The payments for landing charges etc., did not exceed £500 a year. I went on to say that as regards the occasional tee &gt;1 the Hasa Coast for service aircraft, with which I was now dealing, I did not know whether the King wduIci want to make it a matter of money. If* however, he were put to actual expense, he might perhaps legitimately ex ect it to he covered. I understood that the expense of simple landing grounds suen as were contemplated for use only in emergency would be quite small and that in His Majesty’s Government’s view it would be covered hy a rental of aay G60 per annum for each ground. Such a sum would mean very little to the King but it occurred to me person ally that the fixation of a small rent might have the advantage for him of establishing in *uch the same way as what we called a peppercorn rent that we were not acquiring prescriptive rights in his territory. Fuad Bey said that he would only express his own views. 5 .u views* He mentioned the position in regard to other powe s. said that, as His Majesty’s Government were asking lor facilities to he taken advantage of in emergency conditions only, they could hardly object to the extension of the same facilities to other aircraft. He spoke also of the need for considering Moslem and Arab opinion, which was very sensitive and might suppose that the grant of facilities involved some sort of yielding to British pressure* I suggested that no one in urope and 1 did not think even Moslems or Arabs could put this construction on the matter. Something would depend on the form* The Fiejaz-Nejd G-overrua&lt;:-nt might prefer to follow the plan they had s x&gt;ken of, namely to provide the facilities under general regulations. Hven if they were the subject, however, of an agreement with His Majesty’s Government, the oower most nearly interested, I di&lt; not see that anyone could see anything to take exception to, ii it were known that others needing to use the facilities could do so. I remin ded Fuad Bey that the King had spontaneously told me in 1930 that he no longer attached importance to a k-.net of adverse opinion of which he had been apprehensive at an earlier stage, that of nis own tribes. 6 . Fuad Bey went on to s &gt;eak of the financial aspect. It was one, he said, which any reasonable Government was justi fied in taking into account. If his overmaent provided landing grounds, they would iu--ve to have buildings, administrative officials, customs officers and oliee. 1 opened my eyes at this and reminded him yet once more that it was a question oi emergency landing grounds. I suggested that such a parade would be quite superfluous and that little more would be required than an occasional visit. He was inclined to insist that, ii there were any landing grounds at 1 , there would be a gradually increasing use of them and that administrative machinery would be necessary. deferring to what X had told him about the financial...financial arrangements in Persia, he said that at the time of the agreement between the Persian Crovenment and Imperial Air ways, His Majesty’s Government had made many concessions in other directions to Persia. He rattled off a list of questions between us and the Persian Government, both settled and unsettled. I said he seemed to know a great deal about a subject of which ay own recollection was faint, as I had been in orocco at the time. I headed him off the subject. 7. In the course of the conversation, which was long and of which I have summarized only the main points, reference was made to specific sites including Jinnah Island. Fuad Bey, noting that I had surgested three landing grounds, asked which they were. I said I had not been referring to specific places, except in the case of Jinnah, which did seem to be specially suitable, owing to its position, to the feet that it was known to have bee i surveyed and that it satisfied a condition to which the Kihg was believed to attach importance, that of being an island. I had no similar information about any other place. It would be for his Gove mment to select the beet laces, although as I had said, it would help them and be in our interest, if advantage were taken of the oifer of assistance of our experts in the Royal Air Force. Fuad Bey himself mentioned Jubail and t&gt;arin Island, as being places which had been surveyed and at which he thought some marking hrd been done. 8. I was extremely disappointed by Fuad ley’s reaction. It is quite clear that he dislikes the whole idea and would like, if the King should agree to the request of His Majesty’s Government, to see him drive a hard bargain. I could only ask him to report what I had said and to let me mow His Majesty’s views in due course. I am afraid that the King also dislikes the idea of committing himself in any way but it is^ Cj&lt; . 4 115? is possible that this le a case in which he himself mi^ht he prospect of my seeing hifii before April at the soonest* 9* At the best, I anticipate great difficulty in achieving anything. I would ask you to consider whether it the provision of definite landing grounds. Unless they are absolutely necessary, it might be more practicable to get an understandin that, if service aircraft (and civil aircralt, should Imperial Airways decide to use the Bahrain route should be forced to land in distress, the Hejaz Nejd Government would not object either to the landing or the immediate acspatch of relief, provided that in all such cases, they would oe advised as soon as possible on receipt by this Legation of telegraphic information. If this were sufficient, it would be possible to stress even more than has hitherto been done, the consider ations of humanity and hospitality. In two recent cases that of Squadron Leader Warburten'e misadventure in the desert and the forced deacent of the Rangoon flyin boat at - innah, Ibn Sa’dd has been glad to make a display of his generosity. 10. I trust you will not think that I went too iar in my references to Imperial Airways, having regard to the confidential nature of your despatch No.512 of j-ecember 29. It was necessary in any case to tell Fuad Bey that, whereas my representations last year had related both to civil and military aircraft, I was renewing them with special reference to the latter. This being so, I felt that it wae necessary to reveal something of the position as regards civil aircraft. favour of 8 ervice aircraft only and then proceeded from that more amenable to a direct appeal. U fortunately there is no necessary to pursue the matter on the basis oi pressing ior It would be most unfortunate, if we obtained a eoncebsion in to nto a further request in favour of Imperial Airways. Ihn Sa’Qd would think that we had deliberately reduced our desiderata to secure their acceptance» only to get the thin end of the wedge in first and then press forward the thick end.

This question (see January-February report, paragraph 45) also remained in abeyance pending the establishment of a more satisfactory situation in regard to the Transjordan frontier. Sir A. Ryan informed Fuad Bey in general conversation on the 21st April that he would soon be reopening the question of landing grounds on the Hasa coast. Fuad Bey asked that action should be postponed until he had had a chance of remedying the deterioration of Anglo-Hejazi relations during his absence Sir A. Ryan agreed to go slow for the time being, doing this all the more readily because of the near approach of the pilgrimage season.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required Prom HEJA Z- Decypher.

In reply to note based on your telegram No.132, Fuad has written letter private and urgent conveying message from King.

Fuad asks for full reply as soon as possible.

Please see previous submission on P.Z. 1265/31 below. The matter was finally taken up by Sir Andrew Ryan with the Foreign Minister on 2Pth May (P.Z. 3513/31), when Fuad adopted a generally friendly attitude. The terms of his official reply on behalf of the Hejaz Government (Jeddah telegrams 178 and 179 of 28th June on P.Z. 4-186/31) were, however, r less satisfactory and admitted of being described by Sir Andrew Ryan as having 'been drafted so as to combine a good deal of evasion with appearance of friendly reception of your request . The latest report (Jeddah telegram 183 of 13th July, P.Z. 4499/31) is definitely less encouraging. The promised general regulations to govern aviation in the areas concerned are not yet forthc-eing; the indicata are/ ionsmiiL V are that the Hejaz Goverrment are likely to wish to see what they can get out of His Majesty’s Government and/or Imperial Airways before making any move; while the internal political situation also seems more unfavourable. In the event of its being decided to proceed with the civil air route down the Arab coast, we could, it is understood, at a pinch fly outside territorial waters along the Hasa section. But a refusal of facilities in Hasa by Ibn Saud, or their grant only on onerous firancial terms, would constitute a further, though a minor, argument against pressing the Arab route at this stage.

I asked Fuad on July 7th what the last sentence of Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note meant. His reply made it clear that he had in mind some kind of contract similar to that which he believed to exist between Imperial Airways and Persian Government. He enquired as to terms of that contract. He hinted more vaguely at idea of financial remuneration even in case of service aircraft. I naturally confined myself to elucidating in a general way what was intended and did not engage in discussion. There is no sign of new regulations. Fuad said that matter was delayed owing to difference of opinion. My impression is that Kejaz Government wish to see what they can get out of His Majesty’s Government and/or Imperial Airways before moving in any direction. Position may also be affected by Ibn Baud's recent swing towards Wahabi 'extremists on which I am reporting by despatch.

My teleyran No. 154.^ Keply from T -!ejaz Government after Bumning up my memorandum states they are preparing general regulations regarding aviation in areas in which it is to he allowed and that competent authorities to whom they have referred are also drawing up necessary instructions regarding control of aeroplanes, conditions of landing, etc. Pending completion of these arrangements Mejaz Government wish 'to enquire of British Government as to terms on which mutual agreement can he come to on this subject with a view to their studying such terms also'. (End of 'E'.) This reply seems to have been drafted so as to com bine a good deal of evasion with appearance of friendly reception of your request. Proposed regulations do not seem to be in as advance^ a state as Fuad led me to think. Last sentence of reply is difficult to interpret. As financial stringency is now strong factor in Ibn baud’s attitude towards all questions, it may mean that he would consider proposal to rent landing grounds. You fore shadowed this possibility in your lo.'egram Mo. 77 of last2^6 4 2 . year, it is now too late to do anything before the King goes to Nejd. I therefore think that my best course v/ill be to av/ait Fuad’s next visit and question him. Lay I know (a) what my attitude should be if he should hint at financial deal and (b) degree of importance attached to favourable settlement of question having regard to position vis-a-vis Persia? As regards (a) I 'should expect Ibn Saud to have extravagant ideas if he is thinking in these terms. As regards (b) I consider prospect of Detaining really satisfactory arrangement to TV be pool although it would be better if there were any chance of general understanding of kind suggested in conversation mentioned in first paragraph of my telegram No. 170.r 3521 I 1931 J NO DISTRIBUTION . .0 Code telegram to Sir A, Ryan, (Jedda), Foreign Office, 29th May, 1931, 7 C 30 p.m 3 No.92.

There is no foundation whatever for the allegation that aircraft flew over Jinnah Island and Jutail, nor for the suggestion that there is persistent violation. On 14th May one Rangoon flying heat, one Wapiti floatplane, and two Wapiti landplanes flew from Basrah to Bahrein. None of these aircraft flew within less than three miles of coast with possible exception of Rangoon which, v/hen near Abu Ali Island, may have approached to within two and a half miles of the coast as pilot feared he might have to alight (though he did not do so) owing to slight accident to propeller. This could not, however, be aircraft soen as pilot did not circle on his course nor sight Jinnah Island nor pass within three miles of Jubail. On 17th May one Rangoon flying boat flew from Basran to Bahrein but did not approach within three miles of the coast. Jinnah and Jubail were not sighted. Ends.

It appears that Sir A.Kyan, while realizing that in the opinion of the Air Council it would be desirable that three landing-grounds should be established on that coast at intervals of sixty miles, wishes to be informed whether, if the Hejazi Government should prove unwilling to arrange for three landing-grounds, a single ground at Jinnah would in the last resort suffice. Mr♦Henderson would be glad to learn what reply should in the opinion of the Air Council be returned to Sir A»Ryan f s enquiry on this point. 3. Copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office and the Colonial Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) G. W. RENDEL. The Secretary of the Air Ministry./4 zr7\ 1506 Decypher.

As regards location and number of landing grounds it will be remembered chief pilot advised in favour of establishing one at JINNAH Island., If this would suffice matter might be much easier.

It will be remembered that, despite various efforts, we have so far bee-n unsuccessful in securing permission from Ibn Saud to reconnoitre the Hasa section of the Arab air route, and that on various occasions during the last three years we have tried to turn to advantage projects for pearling flights in the Persian Gulf in this connection. Sir Andrew Ryan, in his telegram of 11th February on P.Z. 886/31, has now revived the question. The moment is not a good one to ask for concessions from Ibn Saud. in view of the strained nature of our relations with him over the Transjordan raids. But the Minister has been authorised if, despite this, he thinks any good can be done, to make a request/request for ’’facilities in connection with use of Persian Gulf air route by British aircraft, civil or military'. If we are going to press this point, the straightforward course of asking for what we wa^t is probably the best; but it seems improbable that a^y progress can be hoped for until the general atmosphere as between us and the King is clearer. f- iu m , * ..request for ’’facilities in connection with use of Persian Gulf air route by British aircrait, civil or military'.

Air Ministry are, however, airzious to press on with matter without unnecessary delay, and if, notwithstanding foregoing consideration, moment is not un favourable, you may at your discretion discuss it on following lines. Project for pearling flights to Bahrein has been dropped Mr Linistry therefore desire that request should be for facilities in connexion with use of Persian Gulf air route oy British aircraft, civil or military. It can be exp loaned to Ton Sand that His majesty’s Government do not request general permission to fly over NejcL territory, but merely desire assurance that if British aircraft on Persian Gulf roume are compelled by untoward circumstances to enter and alight on Nejdi territory they will be tre /bed in accordance viun usual rules of international courtesy. This iraplios i.ierely (a) such general assistance and good treatment, as considerations ...considerations of hmanitarianism and hospitality naturally dictate; and (t) that no objection will he rsised to immediate despatch of assistance by ear, if necessary. Mr Ministry add that it is desirable that location of lending-grounds between Koweit and Bahrein should be known to pilots in case of emergency. Three landing- grounds on Rasa coast at approximately 60 miles interval would be desirable and if possible, it would be well that Air Officer Commanding Iraq should be consulted in their selection.

The intention was that these facilities would be used by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) or Imperial Airways in the event of an emergency. It further covers measures to be taken to prevent the intrusion of British aircraft into Saudi territory during the progress of negotiations.Also briefly covered in the file is a visit by Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] to the Netherlands in 1935 (see folios 26-71) and the attitude of the Saudis to foreign aircraft flying over their territory (see folios 3-21).The main correspondents are as follows: HM Minister at Jeddah (Sir Andrew Ryan), officials of the Foreign Office (mainly George William Rendel), and officials of the Air Ministry (mainly James Stirling Ross). The negotiations are primarily undertaken through Fuad Bey Hamza and Shaikh Yusuf Yasin.Prior to 1932, Saudi Arabia was known as the Kingdoms of Hejaz and Nejd, and this is reflected in the file.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
