My Lord, 6th., 1940. ^ ^ L f/' /l *os 1 ! irh iaJ ' t/'£r v (/- b&lt;4 The Italian monthly review 'Oriente Modemo H published in October last a list of the 'Ikhwan' settlements or colonies which had been established in various parts of &lt;ejd, and which were mentioned in the press reports of the tribal meeting which took place at Hiyadh in August 1939. The Italian paper’s report gave the impression that the Ikhwan movement was still of great political importance in this country. lr. de Oaury, however, went through the list of settlements and made certain conments whion may interest Your Lordship’s department, and I now have the honour to submit a short note on the present position of the Ikhwan movement in the light of Mr. de Oaury’s report and such other information as is available. I must however confess that accurate information from Arab sources on this subject is almost impossible to obtain. 2. It will be rem^bered that the religious settlements of the ”Ikhwan 11 (brethren ) date from 1912. A general des- cription of their character and objects is give* In 'Field Notes on Saudi Arabia”, 1935, pages *&gt;«*&gt; and 33. The original idea was to establish agricultural settlements throughout the various tribal areas, peopled by the more fanatical elements of tfahhabl Arabs, in order not only to break up the existing nomad and tribal organisation for the benefit of the state, but to retain the services of the fanatics and divert / them The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K.G. *C. ftOv; '■% 9c.

Mr. de Gaury, however, now informs me that in the opinion of many Arabs with whom he talked recently at Riyadh the Ikhwan movement is dead* Appendix IV, page 130, of 'Field JTotes' draws attention to the gradual lowering of the strict religious standards which had been the boast of the first settlers in 'Ikhwan' co irminities. It appears that this deterioration of religious seal has gone on at an increasing rate. iuch settleiaents as remain are no longer religious colonies: the increasing tide of prosperity and security against tribal raids has resulted in a good deal of tribal settlement, and the Ikhwan colonies have become merged into, and swallowed up by, tribal settlements which have little or no connexion with strict Wahhabi tenets. In some cases Mr. de Gaury knew from personal experience that settlements mentioned in the lists no longer exist at all: for example, the colony called 'Ureira* in the Ajman tribal territory, which never had more than about four houses, is now completely deserted. The tendency towards tribal settleiaent is well shown by such schemes as the agricultural development at : hard, about which a separate report has been auteitted.
