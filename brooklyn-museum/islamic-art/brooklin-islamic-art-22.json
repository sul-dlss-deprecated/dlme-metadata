Flowers, particulary carnations and tulips, were recurring motifs that were very popular in Ottoman textile design. With their bold simplicity and often crimson grounds, Ottoman textiles are suggestive of supreme confidence ahd power. The vigilant care of these treasured panels by the court and the elite has ensured their preservation over the centuries.</p>", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-08-01", "date_added": "2008-09-26 00:00:00", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 5519, "name": "Turkey", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "86.227.108_PS2.jpg", "id": 13237, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/86.227.108_PS2.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/86.227.108_PS2.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 41, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 83, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 167, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 334, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 668, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/86.227.108_PS2.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Velvet Panel</em>, 17th century.
