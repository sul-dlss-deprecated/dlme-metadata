Political Intelligence Department, Foreign Office. Special 3. MEMORANDUM on BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO KING HUSE1N. OUI\ commitments to Kiug Husein are not embodied in any agreement or treaty signed, or even acknowledged, by both parties. In this way they differ from those to Russia., I ranee, Italy, and certain independent Arab rulers such as the Idrisi and bin Saud. They can only be analysed by summarising the history of our dealings with the King during the war, under different'he ids. And the position is complicated by the King's habit of ignoring or refusing to take note of conditions laid down by us to which he objects, and then carrying on as if the particular question had been settled between us according to his own desires. 1 he references in the following summary, where not to Foreign Office papers, are to the historical narrative compiled by the Arab Bureau at Cairo and dated the 29th November, 1916. The pagination referred to is that of the Foreign Office copy (filed in the Library under ' Confidential : Turkey : Arab Bureau: 1914 seaa. (No. m)'). (i.) General Guarantees against the Restoration of the status quo. His Majesty's Government's representatives in Egypt had been in touch with Sherif Husein and his sons—especially Abdullah —before the war. On the 24th September 1914 (in the interval during which Great Britain was at war with Germany but not yet with Turkey) the Foreign Office telegraphed at Lord Kitchener's request to Cairo, instructing that a special messenger should be sent to Abdullah to enquire what would be the Sherif's attitude in th^ event of war with Turkey breaking out (p. 21a). Abdullah sent a written answer expressing his preference for Great Britain over Turkey,— ' So long as she protects the rights of our country and the rights of the person of His Highness our present Emir and Lord and the rights of his Emirate and its independence in all respects, without any exceptions or restrictions, and so long as it supports us against any foreign aggression and in particular against the Ottomans, especially if they wish to set up anv one else as Emir with the intention of causing internal dissension—their principle of government—and provided that the Govern ment of Great Britain would guarantee these fundamental principles clearly and in writing. This guarantee we expect to receive at the first opportunity ' (p. 23). This request was met in a Foreign Office telegram of the 31st October 1914 (the date on which war between Great Britain and Turkey was declared) :— ' Lord Kitchener's salaams to Sherif Abdullah If the Arab nation assist England in this war that has been forced upon us by Turkey, England will guarantee that no internal intervention takes place in Arabia, and will give Arabs every assistance against external aggression. ' It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Khalifate at Mecca or Medina and so good may come by the help of God out of all the evil that is now occurring' (p. 24). This statement was transmitted to Abdullah by letter from Cairo with the following addition :— If the Emir of Mecca is willing to assist Great Britain in this conflict. Great Britain is willing, recognising and respecting the sacred and unique office ol the Emir Husein (titles), to guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Slierifiate against all external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till now we have defended Islam in the person of the Turks; henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arabs ' (p. 24). [883] BIn the letter which Sherif Husein sent to Sir H. McMahon in July, 1915, definitely proposing an agreement with Mis Majesty's (rovermerit, he laid down the following condition :— ' Thirdly, for the security of this Arab independence and the certainty of such preference of economic enterprises, both high contracting parties to offer mutual assistance to the best ability of their military and naval forces, to face any foreign Power which may attack either party. Peace not to be decided without agreement of both parties' {p. 40). This condition was more emphatically stated in the Sherifs third letter to Sir H. McMahon, dated the 5th November 1915 :— ' (5) When the Arab knows that the Government of Great Britain is their Ally who will not leave them to themselves at the conclusion of peace, in the face of Germany and Turkey, and that she will support and effectively defend them, then to enter the war at once will be, no doubt, in conformity with the general interest of the Arabs ' (p. 94). In reply to this, Sir H McMahon, acting on Foreign Office instructions, gave the following assurance in his third letter to the Sherif, dated the 13th December, 1915 :— 'It is-most essential that you should spare no effort to attach all the Arab peoples to our united cause, and urge them to afford no assistance to our enemies. ' It is on the success of these efforts, and on the more active measures which the Arabs may hereafter take in support ot our cause, when the time for action comes, that the permanence and strength of our agreement must depend. ' Under these circumstances, I am further directed by the Government ot Great Britain to inform you that you may rest assured that Great Britain has no intention of concluding any peace, in terms of which the freedom of the Arab peoples from German and Turkish domination does not form an essential condition (p. 103). The Sherif took note of this assurance in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, dated the Ist January, 1916 :— 1 have a strong belief, which the living will inherit frcJm the dead, in the declarations which you gave in the conclusion of your honoured letter (p. 11«5). Ihe assurance was of course contingent, but the Sherif's action since that date has evidently brought it into operation. It was repeated in a Foreign Office message telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate, on the 4th February, 1918, for transmission to the Sherif (now King of the Hejazj :— ' His Majesty's Government, along with their Allies, stand for the cause of the liberation C )t the oppressed nations, and are determined to stand by the Arab peoples in their struggle for the reconstruction of an Arab world, in which law shall once again replace Ottoman violence tmd unity the artificial rivalries promoted by lurkish officials. His Majesty's Government re -affirm their former i t ues to His Highness in regard to the freeing of the Arab peoples. Liberation tie po ic\ His Majestys Government have pursued and intend to pursue with unswerving determination by protecting such Arabs as are already liberated from ' 'e danger of re-conquest, and assisting such Arabs as are still under the yoke of the oppressor to obtain their freedom.' 1 Relation of Commitments wider (i) to British desiderata:— conflict, if interpieted in the light of our reservations under (iii), (i v ) an ^ ( v )' Th ,, Guarantee! regarding X914 . nment of India issued the following proclamation on the 2nd Novemher, the ictrVofTirL^ 1 Briiflh', e h k f Wa 'i betw , een Great Britain and Turkey, which to anc deliberatp nnf' r S. 11 brought about by the ill-advised, unprovoked, authorised by His Mlieatv' 0 p 0mai1 Government, his Excellency the Viceroy is J y s Government to make the following public announce- 1 22108/146/18.July, 1915, definitely i down the following i the certainty of such Tties to offer mutual 3S, to fac^ any foreign ed without agreement ^rifs third letter to rieat Britain is their l of peace, in the face Actively defend them, mity with the general instructions, gave the h December, 1915 :— to attach all the Arab lance to our enemies, .ctive measures which en the time tor action riust depend. iy the Government of Great Britain has no freedom of the Arab ot form an essential r to Sir H.

These Holy Places and Jeddah will be immune from attack or molestation by British naval and military forces, so long as there is no inter ference with pilorims from India to the Holy Places and Shrines in question. At the request of His Majesty's Government, the Governments of P ranee and Russia have £riven similar assurances (p. *-3). o ^ A much looser pledge, extending to the whole of Arabia, was given in a Foreign Office telegram of the 14th November, 1914, to the High (Commissioner, Cairo: ' His Majesty's Government have no intention of undertaking any military or naval operations in Arabia, or against its ports, unless such a course becomes necessary for the protection of Arabian interests agriinsi luikis i oi '' llt l aggression, or in support of any attempt by the Arabs to free themse \ ts i •m Turkish rule.' On the 14th April, 1915. the Foreign Office (acting on the strength ot a letter- addressed by Seyyid Sir Ali Morghani, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, to Sir B. Wingate— then Sirdar—and forwarded by him) telegraphed to the iligh ( ommissioner, Cairo . - u You should inform Sir B. Wingate that he is authorised by me to let it be known, should he think it desirable, that His Majesty's Government will make it an essential condition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsuia, ana its Mohammedan Holy Places should remain in the hands oi an inuepenoent Sovereign State ' (p. 30 ). This was communicated to Sir Ali Morghani, and by him, apparently, to Sherit Husein. Later, towards the end of June, the substance of it was embodied in proclamations distributed in Egypt, the Sudan, and Arabia. ^ In October, when the negotiations with the Sherif were well advanced, 1' aroki (a member of one of the Arab Nationalist organisations in the Ottoman army, who had passed over to the British lines at Gallipoli and had been brought to Egypt in October) submitted suggestions to the High Commissioner for assurances to the bherit, one of them being that ' England will guarantee the Holy Places against external aggression and recognise their inviolability (p. 51). Sir H. McMahon communicated this in a private telegram to Sir K. Grey on the 18th October, 1915. Instructions were sent him in a Foreign Office telegram of the 20th October, 1915, and embodied by him in his second letter, dated the 24th October, 1915, to Sherif Husein. In this letter Faroki's suggested assurance regarding the Holy Places was conveyed verbatim. Finally, the following declaration was made in an official communique published on the 29th July, 1916, in Egypt, after the Sherif s revolt, with the authorisation of the Foreign Office:— u It remains the fixed policy of Great Britain to abstain from all interference in religious matters and to spare no effort to secure Holy Places of Islam from all external aggression. It is an unalterable point of British policy that those Holy Places should remain under independent Moslem rule and authority. ' The present state of war places many difficulties and dangers in the way of those wishing to perform the pilgrimage, but the action taken bv the Sherif of Mecca gives rise to hopes that arrangements may be made whereby the pilgrims may in the coming year visit the Holy Shrines in peace and security' (p. 57, Part II). Relation of Commitments under (ii) to British desiderata :— No conflict. (iii.) Boundaries of Arab Independence. In the Foreign Office telegram of the 14th April, 1915 (No. 173), to the High Commissioner, Cairo (quoted in section (ii) above), His Majesty's Government committed themselves to a public declaration that ' they will make it an essential condition in the terms of peace that the Arabian Peninsula should remain in the handsof an independent Sovereign State.' They added, however that ,t is not poss.ble to define at his stage exactlv how much territory shou d be included in this State. That question was raised in July 1915 by Shenf Husem .n his first letter to Sir H. McMahon, the first of the conditions on which he proposed co-operation with Great Britain against the Turks being as follows : 'England to acknowledge the independence of the Arab countries, bounded on the north by Mersina and Adana up to 37° of latitude, on which degree fa Is Biriiik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Amadia Island,* up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basrah ; on the south, by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west, by the 'Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina (p. 40). It appears from a statement made by Faroki (for whom see section (iij above) that Lord Kitchener 's assurance of the 31st October, liU 4, to Slienf Ax u a i (see section (i)) had been discussed between Sharif Husein and the Central Arab Nationalist Committee, which was at that time in being at Damascus^ and tuat this territorial demand was suggested to tiie Sherif by the Committee.' Lmissanes were sent from Damascus to Jed dab with instructions to bargain about this (ItMiand m detail, but to insist on a general acceptance of it by Great Britain as a condition of continuing negotiations. , . . 0 ., •/. tt On the 30th August, 1915, Sir H. McMahon, m his first letter to Shent Husem, gave a non-committal answer on this point, re-affirming Lord Kitcheners pledges, but alluding to the discussion of boundaries as premature (p. 43). On the 9th September, 1915, however, the Sherit, in his second letter, piessed foi definition:— 'Your Excellency will pardon me and permit me to say clearly that the coolness and hesitation displayed in the cjuestion of the limits and boundaries, by saying that the discussion of these at present is of no use and loss of time, and that they are still in the hands of the Government which is ruling them, etc., mi^ht be taken to infer an estrangement or something of the sort. ' As the limits and boundaries demanded are not those of one person whom we should satisfy, and with whom we should discuss them after the war is over, but our peoples have seen that the life of their new proposal is bound at least by these limits and their word is united on this; . . .' ' Therefore they have found it necessary to discuss this point first with the Power in whom they now have their confidence and trust as a final appeal, viz., the illustrious British Empire' fp. 44). The substance of this letter was conveyed to the Foreign Office by Sir I L McMahon on the 18th October, 1915 (telegram No. 623;, and in a private telegram of the same date to Sir K. Grey 4 (p 49) he reported the results of further conversations with Faroki. Faroki declared that Germany had promised the Arab party the fulrilment of all their demands, and that they were at the parting of the ways. He expressed the opinion that:— ' The occupation by France of purely Arab districts of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus would be opposed bv Arabs with force of arms, but with this exception .... they would accept some modification of the North-western boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca (p. 51). This latter suggestion by Faroki is important; for though it does not appear certain that it would have been agreed to by the rest of the Damascus party, and it has certainly never been agreed to bv Sherif Husein, it was taken by His Majesty's Government as the basis of their negotiations with France, and is the origin of the division between the Blue Area and Area A. It was embodied on the '24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMahon's second letter to the Sherif:— 1 he districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus. Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modifications, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs, we accept these limits and boundarirs ; and in regard to those portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her Ally, France, I am empowered in the . Inland or else ' .Jezireh, Amadia.' 3 157740/15: statement by Faroki, pp. 4 and 10. 4 153045/15.name of the Government of Great Britain to give the follow!ag assurances, and make the following reply to your letter :— u ' Subject to the above modifications. Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the 8herif of Mecca ' ' (p. 53). It will be noted that the reservation in favour of French interests, even within the narrower boundaries of Arab independence here proposed, prepared the ground for the establishment of Area A. On the 5th November, in his third letter, the 8'nerif agreed to the exclusion of Mersina and Adana, but formally reiterated his claisi to the rest:— 5 ' In order to facilitate an agreement and to render a service to Islam, and at the same time to avoid all that may cause Islam troubles and hardships—seeing moreover that we have great consideration for the distinguished qualities and dispositions of the Government of Great Britain—we renounce our insistence on the inclusion of the vilayets of Mersina and Adana in the Arab Kingdom. But the provinces of Aleppo and Beirout, and their sea-coasts, are purely Arab provinces, and there is no difference between a Moslem and a Christian Arab : they are both descendents of one forefather' (p. 92). It may be remarked that he does not mention either the vilavet of Lebanon or the sanjak of Jerusalem—territories which were both excluded from the independent Arab State in the subsequent Anglo-French Agreement. But he has expressly claimed Lebanon on other occasions since then, and his reference to the Christian Arabs here implies its inclusion. The policy laid down with regard to the Christians was evidently inspired by the Damascus Committee, for Faroki. in his conversations at Cairo, stated their views on the point thus : — ' The basis of the new Arab Empire will be national, not religious. It will be an Arab, not a Moslem Empire. Christian Arabs, Druses, and Nosairia will have the same rights as Moslems, but the Jews will be governed by a special law.' 6 The Sherit's renunciation of Mersina and Adana and guarantees to the Christian Arabs were taken note of by Sir H. McMahon in his third letter of' the 13th December, 1915. His reiterated claim to Aleppo and Beirout vilayets was ignored (p. 102). On the 1st January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherif answered by declaring that he would not press his claims against France till after the war, but announcing his intention of then doing so :— ' As regards the northern parts and their coasts, we have already stated in our previous letter what were the utmost possible modifications; and all this was done only so as to fulfil those aspirations whose attainment is desired by the will of the Blessed and Supreme God. It is this same teeling and desire which impelled us to avoid what may possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France and tlie agreement made between them during the present wars and calamities ; yet we find it our duty that the eminent Minister should be sure that, at the first opportunity after this war is finished, we shall ask you (what we avert our eyes from to-dav) for what we now leave to France in Beirout and its coasts .... (P- HJ). ' ' It is impossible to allow any derogation that gives France or any other Power a span of land in those regions' (p. Hi). Sir H. McMahon answered this in his fourth letter of the 30th January 1916, by taking note of the Sherif s ' desire to avoid anything which might possibly injure the alliance of Great Britain and France,' and warning him that the friendship between the two countries would endure after the war (Part II, p. 5). The Sherif, on his part, never referred to the boundary question again during the negotiations, but there is evidence to show that the claims not accepted by His Majesty's Government have not been withdrawn by him. ' I'ns formula (ami uot the Dainascus-Homs-ilain.i-Aleppo liue) was proposed to air Mark Sykes by l aroki about the beginning of .November (p. 104). Faroki and the iSherif were in commuuication through the kShenl s messenger to Cairo. 0 157740/15 : Faroki's statement, p. 10. [883] ' CFor instance, a letter written to him by his son Sherif Ali on the 26th May, 1916, on the eve of the revolt, and mostly occupied with military details, concludes :— ' Our Lord will not, we hope,, forget Alexandretta, Beirout, and those regions ' (Part 11, p. 41). Again, Shei if Abdullah remarked to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah on the 1st November, 1916, 7 apropos of his father's assumption of the title of ' King of the Arabs,' that ' the boundaries of his kingdom were settled previous to the revolt —a misstatement of the facts, unless it was intended, as it certainly was not, as an acceptance of the boundaries His Majesty's Government had consented to. On the 29tli July, 1917, King Husein expressed his views on the boundary question to Captain Lawrence ;— s ' The main points were that he had altogether refused to permit any French annexation of Beirout and the Lebanon. ' They are Arab countries, but 1 will neither take them myself nor permit anyone else to take them. They have deserved independence and it is my duty to see they get it.' ' He said tlutt he refused a detailed discussion of boundaries on the grounds that hostilities between Turkey and the Allies still continue and all decisions taken now would necessarily have to be modified in accordance with the actual results of military operations, for which he must have an absolutely free hand. ' II advisable we will pursue the Turks to Constantinople and Erzerum, so why talk about Beirout, Aleppo, and Hail.' ' He revealed the same state of mind in conversations with Colonel Wilson a few months later. 9 From convt rsations with him during the second week of January, 1918, Commander Hogarth gathered that he still expected France and Great Britain to fall out, and calculated that he would be able to force the hand of the French with our backing. 10 On the 11th February, 1918, Colonel Basset wrote to Sir T\. Wingate that King Husein had read into the terms of His Majesty's Government's ' pledge' very wide territorial boundaries, and professes the most implicit trust in the intention and ability of Great Britain to redeem the ' pledge ' as he reads it.' 11 Relation of Commitments under (Li) to British Desiderata. The boundaries of Aiab independence to which His Majesty s Government are committed by Sir H. McMahon's second letter to Sherif Husein (24th October, 1915), exclude (a) the British territory and Protectorate of Aden ; and presumably also {b)t e British Protectorate of Bahrein, since the Sherif's claims take the ' Indian Ocean as the boundary of the Arabian Peninsula, and make no mention ot islands (see nist e er of Julv 1915, quoted above). , t • On the other hand, they include (c) Akka-Haifa and (d) Basra, though, m e agreement of the 6th May, 1916, with France, and in correspondence which has passed at various times between the Foreign Office and the India Office, it seems to be assume that both these places will become British enclaves in the independent Ara ai V 1 ' attached in some formal way (whether by annexation, protectorate, or lease) to e Biicish Empire. . v i Sir Mark Sykes reported that, in his conversations with iaroki early m i ( ^. em , 1915, the latter stated that ' the Arabs would agree to Basra town and all cu iva e lands to the south being British territory. ' 12 But there is, no other recoic 0 . suc ,. . concession on his part or on the part of any other representative of the Ara na 10 ' a . organisations in Turkey.. And King Husein has never mentioned the possi^ i 1 y 0 ^ nor have His Majesty's Government mentioned it in their correspondence wit i mi. Again, tht right of transporting British troops, in peace or war, along a n j owned railw r ay from Akka-Haifa to Irak and the Persian (rult lias only jeen agicvc by France, Italy, and Russia, but has never been either demanded or consente any negotiations between His Majesty's Government and tbe Arabs themse ves.

In his private telegram of the 18lh October, 1915; to Sir E. Grey Sir H McMabon reported that' ' with regard to Basra vilayet Faroki acce P^ special measures of British control will he necessary, m view of Great^ Britain s interest their instructions telegraphed to Sir H, McMahon on the 20th October, 1915, the Foreign Office replied on this point;— ' Mesopotamia. —In view of the special interests in the Bagdad *! ld ■uea actuallv in our occupation, the proposed sphere o! British contiol, na ■ y, the Basra^I vilayet, will need extension. 1 This will not, of course, prejudice our interests with Arab Chiefs' (p. i)2). This was embodied on the 24th October, 1915, in Sir H. McMabon's second letter to the Sherif:— •' With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basrah, the Arabswih that the established position and interests of Giea J 1 Bnt ^' i '^ lr0111 foreign measuies of administrative control in order to secure th^ tn it • - aggression, to promote the welfare of the local population and to sale^ua.u mutual economic interests (p. 54). The Sherif took up the on the obh November, HUo, m his thnd letter t to Sir H. McMahon :— . , -rr- „ Tir i in ' As the provinces of Irak are parts of the puM; ^ra ^ ^ ^ of . all ^he fact, the seat of its government m b ' th civilisation of the Arabs, Khalifs who succeeded him; and as m then 'built in Islam, where and as their towns in those provinces ' llv valued by the Arab power became so great; therefore ! jLnnot be forgotten by them, all Arabs, far and near, and their tradibon. upsnch a Consequently we cannot satisfy the Ara i a ' r( j ea8 y an d taking into title to nobility.

McMahon reserved the details of Great Britain's position in Bagdad vilayet tor future con sideration :— ' The Government of Great Britain, as 1 have already informed you, are ready to give ad guarantees of assistance and support within their power to the Arab Kingdom, but their interests demand, as you yourself have recognised, a friendly and stable administration in the vilayet of Bagdad, and the adequate safeguarding of these interests calls for a much fuller and more detailed con sideration tUan the present situation and urgency of these negotiations permits' (p. 103). On the 1st of January, 1916, in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMahon, the Sherif omitted further discussion of the conditions of British administration, and left the fixing of the financial compensation (which he had proposed, but to which His Majesty's Government hnd not committed themselves) to His Majesty's Government's discretion :— ' With regard to what had been stated in your honoured communication concerning al-Irak, as to the matter of compensation for the period of occupation, we, in order to strengthen the confidence of Great Britain in our attitude and in our words and actions, really and veritably, and in order to give her evidence of our certainty and assurance in trusting her glorious Government, leave the determination of the amount to the perception of her wisdom and justice ' (p. 112). On the 30th January, 1916, Sir H. McMahon took note of this in his fourth letter to the Sherif, and promised to ' take the question into careful consideration when the enemy has been defeated and the time for peaceful settlement arrives ' (p. 5, Part II). On the 19th May, 1917, in conversation with Sir Mark Sykes and M. Picot, 14 ' King Husein ' admitted the necessity for European advisers to heads of departments, and referred to Syria and Irak,' but he objected to the suggestion that these advisers must have executive authoriry. In an interview on the following day, a declaration by the King, in answer to a message from the French Government which had been delivered to him by M. Picot, was read aloud to the following effect : — ' lhat His Majesty the King of Hejaz learned with satisfaction that the trench Government approved of Arab national aspirations; and that, as he had confidence in Great Britain, he would be content if the French Government pursued the same policy towards Arab aspirations on the Moslem Syrian Littoral as the British did in Bagdad.' 8;niie occasion Sherif iaisal delivered the following message from his father to Sir Mark Sykes&amp; fe • i ^ a re ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent and with England in Mesopotamia ' ^ ,'^ n f Hiisein s \ iew of the results oi these two interviews is given in a report by Oaptain Lawrence of an illuminating conversation with him on the ^9th July, 1917 16 +V,. f ^ extrei . nel y pleased to have trapped M.

McMahon's letter to theSherif on the 24th October, 1915, to its inclusion in the boundaries of Arab indeperHfMice. But they have stated their policy regarding the Palestinian Holy Places and Zionist colonisation in their message to him of the 4th January, 1918 :— 17 ' That so far as Palestine is concerned, we are determined that no people shall be subjected to another, but that in view of the fant : ' (a.) That there are in Palestine shrines, Wakfs, and Holy Places, sacred in some cases to Moslems alone, to Jews alone, to Christians alone, and in others to two or all three, and inasmuch as these places are of interest to vast masses of people outside Palestine and Arabia, there must be a special regime to deal wirh these places approved of by the world. ' (h.) That as regards the Mosque of Omar, it shall be considered as a Moslem concern alone, and shall not be subjected directly or indirectly to any non-Moslem authority. ' That since the Jewish opinion of the world is in favour of a return of Jews to Palestine, and inasmuch as this opinion must remain a constant factor, and further, as His Majesty's Government view with favour the realisation of this aspiration. His Majesty's Government are determined that in so far as is compatible with the freedom of the existing population, both economic and political, no obstacle should be put in the way of the realisation of this ideal,' This message was delivered personally to King Husein by Commander Hogarth, and the latter reported on his reception of it as follows :— 'The King would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was T instructed to warn him that such a State was contemplated by Great Britain. He probably knows nothing of the actual or possible economy of Palestine, and his ready assent to Jewish settlement there is not worth very much. But I think he appreciates the financial advantage of Arab co-operation with the Jews.' Finally, it may be noted that King Husein was violently disturbed by the allusions to the Anglo-French Agreement of the lOth May, 1916, made in a speech by Jemal Pasha at L&gt;eirout on the 30r,h November, 1917, and reported in No. 101 ot* the ' Mustakbal, of Paris. |s Jemal represented that Great Britain and France would so interpret their special position in Mesopotamia and Syria respectively as to confine King Husein's effective power to the Hejaz. In view of the King's attitude towards this question recorded above, the effect upon him of JemaTs insinuation was inevitable. Relation of Commitments regarding Mesopotamia under (iv.) to British Desiderata. Area —His Majesty's Government stipulated for 'special measures of administra tive control' in Basra and Bagdad vilayets. The Sberif, in his final statement on the subject on the 1st January, 191G, referred to Irak, which is equivalent. N.B.—In November, Faroki talked to Sir Mark Sykes about a special position for Great Britain in ' Mesopotamia,' and the same word is used in Sir Mark Sykes report of the Sherif's message to him on the 20th May, 1917. It is not clear whether this is simply a rendering of Irak or is intended to include Jezireh. Terms. —Sherif Husein laid down no terms except a monetary compensation to himself (as representing the Arab Confederation) for the duration of the British control. He left the fixing of the amount to His Majesty's Government. His Majesty's Government have not committed themselves to such payment or to any other condition. Duration. —Throughout the negotiations the Sherit assumed that this would be limited, and it is clear from his conversation with Captain Lawrence that he regards it as understood that it shall be short. His Majesty's Government, on their side, have committed themselves to no time limit whatsoever. (v.) Relation of Slier if Husein to Great Britain. In his first letter of July, 1915, Sherif Husein proposed that Great Britain should enjoy priority of economic enterpiise throughout the territory included withm 17 245810/18. is 123868 /18 : King Husein'!? letter of the 5th June, 1918, to Sir R. Wingate. [8a3] . D9k . 10 the boundaries oi' Arab independence claimed by him (Proposal 12). In the same area he asked for our assent to the abolition of the Capitulations, and our assistance in securing an ' International Convention ' to the same efiect (Proposal 5). The proposal regarding the Capitulations was ignored by His Majesty's Government and does not appear to have been referred to again by the Sherif. With regard to British priority, which Sir H. McMuhon proposed to extend to the political as well as the economic sphere (p. 50), the Foreign Office instructed him as follows in their telegram of the 20th October, 1915 : — ' Unless it is necessary in order to secure Arab consent, you should not include the stipulation that they will recognise British interests as paramount and work under British guidance. &amp;c. Such stipulation might give rise in France to the impression that we are aiming not only at the securing of Arab interests, but also at the establishment of our own interests in Syria at the expense of the French (p. 52). On the 24th October, 1915, in his second letter to the Sherif, Sir H. McMahon interpreted these instructions as follows :— ' When the situation admits. Great Britain will give to the Arabs her advice and will assist them to establish what may appear to be the most suitable forms of government in those territories. ' Oa the other hand, it is understood that the Arabs have decided to seek the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that such European advisers and officials as may be required for the forination of a sound form of administration will be British' (p. 54). The point was taken up again in Sir E. Grey's telegram No. 860, of the 2nd November, 1915, to Sir H. McMahon : ' I propose that my main object shall be to persuade the French Government to agree to include within the Arab boundaries the cities of Aleppo, Homs, Hama and Damascus^ ' In order to gain this point, however, we must be ready to waive the condition that European officials and advisers of the Arab Government are to be only British, and that the Arabs are to turn to Great Britain alone for guidance and advice. ' I should like to know whether this condition was included not to meet the wishes of the Arabs, but merely for the sake of our own interests. If the bitter is the case and if by dropping it we can obtain the concurrence of the Irench Government in promising the four cities to the Arabs, I shall consider myself free to do so in consultation with Mr. Chamberlain (Secretary of Stcite for India). ' To win the Arabs over to our side against the Turks is our vital and foremost object, not the acquisition of a new sphere of influence tor ourselves (p. 60). This was answered by Sir H. McMahon on the 7th November, 1915 :— ' It was at the express request of the Arabs that the clause concerning the advice and guidance of Great Britain only, and that all advisers and officials should be British, was included. They do not welcome the idea of French influence in the territories of the four cities, and were anxious to have British advisers, &amp;c., there—in fact, they wished the clause to apply to the whole o Arabia' (p. 61). This view was in a general way corroborated by a passage in a letter, dated the 28th December, 1916, from Sherif Husein to Sir Ali Morghani:— 1! ' ' It is impossible for us to acknowledge any other Power than Great Britain in our communications and representations. I say this from a purely economic point of view, but from the military point of view we none of us ignore c certainty that we shall stand in great need of the power of Great Britain o extinguish any trouble that is liable to break out in the interior of the . coun ^ v |j| the initial stages of so great changes ; more particularly because our fnem s not hesitate by all possible means to incite their own partisans against u^ for ei own ends, in spite of the fact that they will have to defend their own interes s 19 30674/1G. 30 ?

It is therefore necessary to take such action as will protect British interests and at the same time will preserve all the rights of independence' (p. 117). Later, on the occasion of the first French Mission to the Hejaz at the beginning of October, 11)10, Sherif tlusein consulted His Majesty's Government through A Mullah as to the form of his reply to the greeting brought by the Mission from the French Government/ 21 And in the s^me connection he informed Colonel Wilson at Jeddah that ' he would much prefer that no one helped him except the British Government' 22 Again, in telephone conversations on the 1st November, ID 16, and the 2nd November, 1916, on the subject of Husein's assumption of the Royal title, Abdullah referred to Great Britain as ' our sole and respectable Ally, and the King himself remarked that ' if any other Government were to ask him to do what he was doing now, he would not accept it, but knowing that the British (iovernment was popular and just, he accepted to take it.' .... Such declarations must, of course, be discounted in view of the circumstances m which they were made and the fact that they were made by Orientals; but there is little doubt that they represent the genuine desire of King Husein and his sons. Relation of Commitments under (v) to British Desiderata. His Maiesty's Government have committed themselves to no special position towards King Husein which is incompatible with their agreemeute with 1 ranee bo long as our good relations with France do not suffer, it is clearly our interest that we should have a predominant position with King Husein and any other Arab • the independent area. On the other hand, one of the Kings s rouges '' Arab seeking to place us in a special position towards himself, as representative of the Arab movement throughout thl- independent area, is the idea that he may -ventualypky us off against France. This appears, for example m the following p^sage on the boundary question in bis fourth letter to Sir H. McMabon of the 1st January, 1916 .- 'I do not find it necessary to draw your attention to the fact that our plan .8 of greater security to the interests and presumption of the rights of t eat Britain than it is to us, and will necessarily be so whatever may happen s » that Britain may finally see all her own peoples in that contentment and which she is endeavouring to establish for them now, espe y , whioh being neighbours to ns will' be the germ of difficulties ^.on wUh w^ h there wilfbe no peace of mind.

His eagerness to deal solely wifh us thus has its embarrassing side. (vi.) Sherif Husein s Title.

This claim was based on his relations with ^eArab. ^ ^ their civilian and military, which had sprung up m the Arab provinces sn 201319/16. 22 220970/16.12 centre at Damascus, and which in the summer of 1915 (when the military fjtrengtl, of r Turks wastnc ;ntrate.i at the Dardanelles, at the oppos .te extrem.ty of the Empire) were a more effective political (actor than at any time before or since. From Faroki's statement, 23 we know that the Damascus Ummutee h a (l allesiance to Sherif Husein before he opened negotiations with kn H- MoM.ihon, and that the terms he put forward (particularly on the question o hcmndaneswereki.^ly suggested by them. He virtually declared thts in his fourth letter to Sir H. McMalion, on the 1st January, 1916 :— ' Your Honour will have realised after the arrival of Mohammed (Faroki) Sherif and his interview with you, that all our procedure up to the present was of no personal inclination or the like, which would have been wholly unintelligible hut that everything was the result of the decisions and desires of our peoples, and that we are hut transmitters and executants of such decisions and desires m the position they (our people) have pressed upon us. , ' These truths are in my opinion very important and deserve ^ our I lonours special attention and consideration ' (p. 111). This explains the large pretensions (otherwise difficult to understand) with which the Sherif started and which he has never given up. But before the Sheiit s revolt in the Hejaz came to a head, the movement in Syria, Irom which his initiative bad come, was crushed bv the Turks. From Faroki's statement it appears that the militaiy branch was broken up about August 1915, while the civilian leaders were mostly hanged or deported in February 1916.'^ In his fifth letter to Sir H. McMahon of the 18th February, 1916, the Sherif mentioned that the Syrian movement had practically been stamped out (p. 6, Part II), and in another letter, dated the 29th^ Maich, IJ10, he stated that the Syrians were now incapable o^ action.- ' His Majesty s Government on their part discouraged the Sherif from a forward policy in Syria on the eve of his revolt, both on military grounds and for fear of political complicauons with Prance. 20 Thus, during the period between the beginning of the negotiations in July 1915, and the outbreak'of the revolt in the Hejaz in June 1916, the relative importance of the Syrian movement dwindled while that of the Sherif increased ; and when the question was raised of sending Faroki and al Masri, as representatives of the movement, to Basra to get into touch with the Arabs in the Turkish Army on that front, His Majesty's Government referred to the Sherif s claim to represent the Arab nation, and laid down their policy as follows :— ' While there is no clear evidence as to how far this claim accords with facts, it has not been questioned by His Majesty's Government. If the claim be well founded, it is a matter for consideration whether independent assurances should be given to other and ex-hypothesi less responsible Arabs.' When, therefore, the Sherif threw off his allegiance to Turkey, he found his effective sovereignty confined to the Hejaz, as Amir of which he was merely one among a number of independent Arab rulers, who divided between them the alleoiance of the tribes and oases of the Arabian Peninsula. The Arabs of Syria and Jezireh, whose allegiance had promised to make him the indisputable leader of the National Movement in the (Asiatic) Arab countries, were still under the heel of the Turk, with no immediate prospect of liberation. But the title to leadership which they had enabled him to assume had been conlirmed by the relations into which he had meanwhile entered with His Majesty's Government; and this, together with his prestige as hereditary guardian of the Holy Cities, made it difficult for him to accept bin Sand, the Imam, the Idrisi, etc., who were his equals in fact, as his peers in honorary rank. 1 hese facts explain the problems that have arisen over his title and his relations with the other independent Arab Chiefs. On the 5th August, 1916, in a telegram of thanks to His Majesty the King for his congratulations on the success of the Hejaz revolt, Husein signed himself, entirely couectly, as 'Sherif and Amir of Mecca,' and the same signature appeared under a proclamation he issued next month to the people of Irak.' 29 K't-i' ^' h ' ^ e ^ e £ ra,ni IGlh October, 11)15, from General Maxwell to Lord &lt; l ' Ul:( l ) ,' , e 1 ur 'o«h account ot the Arab movement is given in ' Verii^ sur la question .' t l l : 1916,i8sued b 3 rt,,e Fourth Turkish Army Commancl). 25 71430/16. 26 76013/16; s n vi ^~ 7 54229/16 : Foreigu Office telegram No. 262 of the 5th April, 1916, to fcir 11.

I have received messages from their notables to this effect.' On the same day Sherif Abdullah telegraphed as follows to Sir H. McMahon and to the Governments of ali Allied and Neutral countries :— ' Je suis tres heureux de vous informer que les notables, les ul^mao Ju pays et toutes les classes de la population, s'^tant rdunis aujourd'hui, ont k I'unanimite reconnu Sa Majeste le Grand Cherif Hussein-ben-Aly 'Koi de la nation arabe' Sa iMajest^ devient de ce fait Sonverain des Arabes, etant donne (pie le pays est p^netre de sa capacite diplomatique, de sa parfaite loyaut^ en vers sa patrie, et de son desir sincere de rdpandre les bienfaits de rinstruction et de la justice dans toutes les regions arabes d^livr^es du joug de la bande Union et Progres.

McMahon suggested that, in view of our treaties recognising the independence of other Arab Chiefs, we could only recognise Sherif Husein as ' King (Mnlik) cf the Hejaz , . 3! On the 3rd November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir H. xMcMahon (No. 880) that the Sherif might be congratulated but not yet accorded recognition, and that the French Government desired to conform their action to that of His Majesty's Government. 35 On the 6th November, 1916, the Foreign Office telegraphed to Sir R. Wingate (Khartoum) the following instructions for a replv to Sherit Abdullah on behalf of the Governments of Great Britain, France and Russia:— ' His Majesty's Government and the Governments of France and liussia, though they regard, and will continue to regard. His Highness as the titular head of the Arab peoples in their revolt against Turkish misrule, and are glad further to recognise him as the lawful and de facto ruler of the Hejaz, are unable to recognise the assumption by him of any sovereign title which might provoke disunion among Arabs at the present moment and thus prejudice the final political settlement of Arabia on a satisfactory basis. That settlement, to be durable, must be come to with the general assent of other Arab rulers, of which at present there is no evidence, and must follow, rather than precede, military success.'' On the 9th November, 1916, Sir H. McMahon telegraphed to the Foreign Office (No. 991) demurring to the expression ' titular head ; and the French Government proposed the substitution for the words ' Arab race' of the words ' population of Arabia.' 37 30 24 ( j 121/1().

Wingate telegraphed (No 531 that, in the reply from His Majesty's Government to the Sherif, which by this time had been despatched, he had styled him ' Sahib al Siyada.' But he criticised the proposed title of ' Malik al Haramein ' on account of its possible religious connotation. It was also objected to on the same grounds by Sir H. McMahon and by the I.idia Office,' and both proposed independently the title 'King of the Hejiz,' which had been Str H. McMahons OTlg 'A tekgSm w' s accordingly sent to Sir R- Wingate instnicting him to .ddress the Sherif as 'His Lor&lt;W&gt;«p ' (Siyada) 'the King (Mahk)of Hejaz, ami this style and title have been adhered to since. 42 ' At the same time Colonel Wilson was instructed, at the ^motion of the India Office, to explain to the Sherif that the limitation of the title Sot affeot tite Agreement between His Majesty's Government and him.'* The Sherif did not question His Majesty's Government's decision (presumably ])ecause he knew himself to have been in the wrong in acting without their knowledge), but it is evident th^t he considers that the wider title is properlv his. For example, in January, 1917, he seems to have composed a second message to the people of Irak in which he signed himself' King of the Arab country and Sherif and Amir of Mecca.' 44 Again, when he was asked by Commander Hogarth in January, 1918, 45 to compose a message for the Arabs of Jerusalem, he proposed to sign it as ' King of the Arabs ' or ' of the Arab nation ' ; and even when he abandoned this signature, he drafted the message in terms which implied this title so patently that he had to be prevailed upon to draft it again. ' It is obvious,' Commander Hogarth wrote, in his report to Sir R. Wingate on this mission, 'that the King regards Arab unity as synonomous with his own kingship, and as a vain phrase unless so regarded. . . . . ^ ' While the King accepted without demur His Majesty's Governments declaration on this matter, as conveyed in Foreign Office telegram No. 6 of the 6th November, 19 1G, to yourself, he left me in little doubt that he secretly regards this as a point to be reconsidered after the Peace, in spite of my assurance that it was to be a definitive arrangement. He compared ourselves and himself (in his habitual homely way) to two persons about to inhabit one house but not agreed which should take which floor or rooms. Otten in the course of our conversations he spoke with a. smile of accounts which he would settle after the war, pending which settlement he would press nothing. I douht if he has any fixed plan or foresees his way; but I have no doubt that in his own nun he abates none of his'original demands on behalf ot the Arabs, or in the fumess 0 time, of himself.' It elation of Commitments under- (vi.) to British Desiderata. His Majesty's Government avoided according Sherif Husein a title incompatible with tMeir commitments to other independent Arab rulers, while the title ^ hic i • ey have recognised does not conflict with the wider claims of the Sherif to w uc i^y consented in the previous negotiations. , But though His Majesty's Government's position on this question may .„ factory on paper, it is far from being so in fact. The harm done by tie coup d'Etat of the 29th October, 1916, has never been repaired. The othet in :^ e ' e to Arab rulers have not been inwardly reassured by our restriction ot the o ieri tiie Hejaz; while he, on his part, has only accepted this restriction as provisiona . The problem has been postponed, not solved. 38 230285/16. 40 244179/16.

Treaties and Agreements between His Majesty's Government and other Arab rulers in the independent area. The boundaries of Arab independence assented to by Sir H. McMahon on the 24th October, 1915, in his second letter to Sherif Husein, included not only (a) Arab territories still subject to the Turk, but also (b) the dominions of independent Arab rulers like the Sultans of Mokalla and Maskat, the Trucial Chiefs, and the Sheiklt of Koweit. with whom His Majesty's Government had treaties, in some cases of more than half a century's standing; and (c) the dominions of Arab rulers, like bin Sand and the Idrisi, whom His Majesty's Government had recognised before the war as being within the Turkish sphere, but with whom we had since made agreements, or were on the point of making them. (The Treaty with the^ Idrisi was signed on the 30th April, 1915, before Sherif Husein had opened negotiations with us, and that with bin Sand on the 2()th December, 1915, before we had concluded them with him.) Sir H. McMahon, therefore, stated in his letter that we accept these limits an&lt;i boundaries without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab Chiefs (p. 53) The point does not appear to have been taken up by the Sherif until his t n letter of the 5th November, 1915, in which, apropos of British administration m Irak, he wrote that he might consent to it ' for a short time, without the rights of either side beino prejudiced thereby (especially those of the Arab Nation, which interests aie economic and vital to it) . . . . at the same time respecting your agreements with the Sheikhs of those districts, and especiallv those which are essential (p.

McMahon, laid it down that:— ' It should 1)6 made clear to the Sherif that when we spoke of our existmg agreements with Sheikhs being upheld, we referred to the Arabian Peninsula no less than Mesopotamia ' (p. 102). And in bis third letter of the 13th December, 1915, Sir H. McMahon embodied these instructions as follows :— •' In stating that the Arabs are ready to recognise and respect all « ur ^es with Arab Chiefs, it is of course understood that this will apply ^ included in the Arab Kingdom, as the Government of Great Britain cannot repudiate engagements which already exist. This stipulation was ignored by the Sherif in his fourth kt 'er of llie lst jsoveinber, 1916, and docs not appear to have been referred to again dnrino; th « ne ?^ ia ^ o After the outbreak of the revolt and the reduction of the Turk^h garnsons at Mecca, Jeddah and Taif, Abdullah, as Sherifial ' Minister for Fo f'8' to have sent messages announcing the victory to the neio )0ui mg . &lt; ''i both bin Sand and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation sent extremely courteous, though non -committal, replies. 1 ' . . tt - Mo^ctv's Kin Saud was also informed of the Hejaz Government through Sir P.

'It is not important whether these people would agree or not. Tn his telephonic conversation later on the si me day he added the following somewhat more satisfactory but still equivocal assurances . 'Bin Saud, Idrisi, &amp;c., are rulers in their places, and we would not interfere with them. They are respected, and if anyone were to attack them we have to ' Our boundaries were settled before the rising, and therefore \\e have no othei ambition, as terms were concluded before that Kingdom ol the bhenf will be up to Iraq. . r * 4 Our respect to this treaty concluded between us and (ireat Ijritain 101 bids us to oppose them, and such is well known to you. This attitude was confirmed by Sherif Husein himself in a letter to Colonel Wilson dated the 4th November, 1916, and he defended it by enclosing copies of the letters to him from bin Saud and the chief of the Hashid and Bekil Confederation, referred to above. These letters had, of course, no bearing on the assumption of the title ' King of the Arabs,' since they were written several months before, on the occasion of his revolt against the Turks. On the 6th November, 1916, His Majesty's Government took note of Abdullah s assurances, such as they were, in their instructions to Sir R. W ingate for the official reply to Abdullah's circular telegram announcing the assumption of the royal title. - Meanwhile, bin Saud had apparently answered the Sherifs second letter to him by expressing readiness to co-operate, but asking for assurances that the Sherif would no lorger encroach on what bin Saud regarded as his own tribal sphere. The Sherif returned this letter unanswered with a ' most discourteous and arrogant' covering note. 53 And he sent equally unsatisfactory replies to congratulatory letters from the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit. 54 Upon receiving a report of this from the India Office, the Foreign Office tele graphed the fullowing message to the Sirdar on the 25rh November, 1916 (No. 24), for transmission to the Sherif:— ' His Majesty's Government learnt with great regret that the three great Arab Chiefs, the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit and bin Saud, have reason to feel aggrieved at the reception of their advances by the Sherif. His Majesty's Government are convinced that such an incident is entirely contrary to the wishes and intentions of the Sherif himself, and that it is no d^ubt due to an oversight on the part of his subordinates; but they must observe that, in view of the very satisfactory attitude of the three Sheikhs in question, the Sherif's own interests, no less than courtesy towards His Majesty s Government, require him to meet the advances of the King's Allies with civility and even with cordiality. His Majesty s Government are using all their influence to secure the cordial co-opera tion of all Arabs with the Sherif, but their efforts will be of no avail if the Sherif himself repels those whom His Majesty s Government have attracted to his support.' In response to this message, the Sherif sent two telegrams to the three Sheikhs, the one congratulating them in turn on their conference with Sir P. Cox at Koweit in 62 221869/16. 54 pG* 84 / 16 Telegram of the 2l8t November, 1917. fr-om Sir P.

This is the first necessity and everything else will follow. I have absolutely no personal ambition in this matter ; my objects are to secure our safety (yours and my own), and the integrity of the Arabian country and its purification from the wickedness and series (? the lies) of the deceitful Turks. On the 12th December, 1916, the Sheikh of Kuweit returned a suitable reply, and this particular incident was closed. 5s The relations of Sherif Husein with the Idrisi and bin Saud, however, have caused His Majesty's Government perpetual difficulties. On the 20th May, 1917, on the occasion of the meeting between the Sheril' and M. Picot and Sir Mark Sykes at Jeddah, 59 Faisal gave Sir Mark Sykes the following message from his father :— 'We are ready to co-operate with France in Syria to the fullest extent and England in Mesopotamia, but we ask for help from England with Idrisi and bin Saud, without in any way infringing on their independence. We beg that Great Britain will endeavour to induce them to recognise King's position as leader of Arab movement.' 1 The Foreign Office consulted with the India Office as to how far it was possible to obtain recognition from the Idrisi and bin Saud of Sherif Husein s special position as leader of the Arab movement, 00 and the question was referred respectively to the Kesident at Aden and to Sir P. Cox. Both reported that the moment was inopportune, and the matter was not proceeded with/' 1 The difficulties between the Sherif and the Idrisi over Kunfida in August, 1916, f - and between the Sherif and bin Saud over Khorma in the summer of 1918, do not fall within the scope of the present section. They were essentially demarcation and allegiance disputes between the Sherif, in his quality of a local Arab ruler, ami his nearest neighbours, and the question of his rank and relation to the Arab Movement was not technically involved. There is no doubt, however, that these and other dispute* of the kind have been and will be considerably embittered by the presence of this larger question in the background. Relation of Commitments under (vii) to British Desiderata. All commitments hitherto made by His Majesty's Government to the Sherit on the one part and the other independent Arab rulers on the other appear to be compatible with one another. . ^ • On the other hand, the problem of retaining the goodwill of the Sherit and securing him the position required by British and French desiderata in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Syria, while at the same time retaining the contidence oi the othei independent Chiefs, remains unsolved. (viii.) The Caliphate. On the 31st October, 1914, Lord Kitchener, in his second message to Sherif Abdullah wrote ;— _ Trx ... , ' It may be that an Arab of true race will assume the Khalitate at Mecca or Medina, and so good may come by the help of God out oi ail the evii that is now occurring.' On the strength of this message, Abdullah, on the occasion ot King Husein s coronation in November 1916, and His Majesty s Government s message ot congratuiatiou 56 2412UG/1G. *1 243796/16. 58 251680/16. 59 104-269/17. 117990-1.. 61 1260«1/17, 137978/17, 141413/17 (the Idrisi) and 15262;)/17, 118989/17, 119702/1. (bin baud). 62 18218S/16 and 215155/16 (No. 142). [883] Fon that event, telegraphed in Husein's name to Colonel Wilson at Jeddah, conveying thanks to His Majesty's Government ' which once addressed him as Caliph.' 03 When pressed on the point by Colonel Wilson, Abdullah admitted over the telephone that no letter was ever addressed to Sherif Husein as Caliph, and quoted the text of Lord Kitchener's message with sufficient accuracy.^ That message, did not, of course, commit His Majesty's Government to more than the pious hope that the question of the Caliphate would be dealt with in a certain manner by the Moslems themselves. But the incident mentioned above shows how dangerous even the most guarded reference to the Caliphate by His Majesty's Govern ment may be, and it is a danger that will increase as we approach the peace settlement. Any possible ambiguity in Lord Kitchener's message was removed bv His Majesty's Government's more detailed declaration in the same sense, conveyed in the Foreign Office Telegram No. 173 of the 14th April, 19lo, to Sir H. McMahon: — ' His Majesty's Government consider that the question of Khalifate is one which must be decided by Mohammedans themselves without interference of non- Mohammedan Powers. Should the former decide for an Arab Khalifate, that decision would therefore naturally be respected by His Majesty's Government, but the decision is one for Mohammedans to make ' (p. 30). This declaration evoked an important memorandum, dated the 6th May, 1915, from Sir Ali Morghani, Grand Kadi of the Sudan, in which he argued that Sherif Husein was the most suitable candidate for the Caliphate, and that if he received unobtrusive support from His Majesty's Government, he had good prospects of obtaining recognition from a majority of Islam, (pp. 32 seqq.) In July 1915, in his first letter to Sir H, McMahon, Sherif Husein demanded that ' England siiould approve of the proclamation of an Arab Caliphate of Islam ' (p. 40). In this he was no doubt encouraged by Lord Kitchener's message, and stimulated by his own ambition for the office, but it appears that he was also prompted, as he was on the boundary question, by the Nationalist Committee at Damascus. Faroki, in his statement at Cairo in October 1915/ 15 mentioned that when he was stationed at Damascus (apparently early in the winter of 1914-15, before the first Turkish attack on the (./anal) he found that the civilian committee there ' had already paid allegiance to the Sherif of Mecca as Caliph and renounced allegiance to Reshad the Sultan of Turkey. Our first action, therefore, after joining that society was that we sent an officer to the Sherif of Mecca, and he paid him allegiance on behalf of all the officers in our party and renounced our allegiance to Reshad.' He further stated that one of the formal aims of the Arab Party was that ' Sherif Husein of Mecca should be Caliph and Sultan of the new Empire.' In conversation with General Clayton he added that :— ' The members of the Society have taken a solemn oath on the Koran that they will enforce their ol ject and establish an Arab Caliphate in Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia at all costs and under any circumstances, sacrificing for this object all their efforts and property and, if need be, their lives.' The fact, which thus seems established, that Sherif Husein, before opening negotiations with us, was offered the Caliphate by an organisation which might reason ably claim at that time to represent the Arab nation in the Ottoman provinces, at any rate in Syria, may be of some importance when the question comes up for settlement. On the 30th August, 1918, Sir H. McMahon, in his first letter to the Sherif, answered the laser's demand regarding the Caliphate by repeating Lord Kitchener s message to Abdullah. He interpreted this as ' approval of the Arab Caliphate when it should be proclaimed,' and added:' We declare on-.-e more that His Majesty s Government would welcome the resumption of the Caliphate by an Arab of true race (p. 4 3). . On the 2nd November, 1915, 66 the Aga Khan called on Sir E. Grey and protestea against the idea of an Arab Caliphate in the name of the Indian Moslems, and Sir L. Grey pave him an assurance in the following terms:— 1 said that we were prepared to favour an independent or autonomous ^ Arabia in the country inhabited by the Arabs ; but anything that we promised to Arabs, or any action that we took to support them, would be of a political anc •» 224419/16 and 224579/16. M 226649/16. 85 157740/15. 6« 164776/15.secular character. We regarded the Khalifate as a thing which should be settled by Moslems for themselves, and in which neither we nor any non-Moslem Power should interfere. The Aga Khan expressed ^ himself quite satisfied, but asked that, in all communi cations with the Arabs, ITis Majesty's Government's attitude should be made very clear. A record of tin's conversation was transmitted to Sir H. McMahon and Sir R Wingate. On the 17th November, 1915, after receiving from Sir H. McMahon a revised summary of the Sherifs third letter of the oth November, 1915, the Foreign Office telegraphed to the former (No. 8S7) 67 :— ' You will, of course, bear carefully in mind the necessity of avoiding all possibility of being involved in any questions concerning the Caliphate.' The subject was accordingly ignored by Sir H. McMahon in the subsequent negotiations. ?&gt;herif Husein, however, gave a clearer indication of his policy on the question in his letter of the 28th December, 1915, to Sir Ali Morghani ,iS :— ' I had not claimed before to be the qualified chief of the Amirs (the Caliph), but 1 explained to them more than once tliat I was ready to extend my hand to any man who would come forward and take the reins of authority. I was, however, chosen in every quarter and even forced to take up the question of their future prospects; and, therefore, I can see no ground for making (further) conditions, such as the universal agreement of the Amirs and tribes which were mentioned, especially the ' Shias,' i .e., the Persians, who lack the necessary qualifications and every other right (to decide the question of the chosen O.'liph of Islam)' (p. 118). The above passage lends significance to the declaration contained in the address presented to Sherif Husein on the 29th October, 1916, by the ' xMimstere, Notables Inhabitants and Ulema of Mecca,' 69 to the effect that ' We take the oath of obedience, loyalty and sincerity to Husein bin Ali, and consider nm a so 0 ® 0 V 1 religious leader until all the Moslem world be of one opinion concerning the Tslamic Caliphate/' And Sherif Abdullah emphasised this declaration m h^ short tdegr.m ot the 29th October, 1916, to Colonel Wilson, announcing the proclamation of his lather ^ k 'ln'conversation over the telephone with Colonel Wilson on the 1st November. 1916. 70 Abdullah explained that:— ' His Mai est v the Sherif has left the question of the Caliphate to the opinion of the M^rwLd and therefore, he, declared that ^ was ny^ested Caliphate, but that the whole question is left to the j th the Ulema of the Qibla decided not to accept the Inrk.sh Caliphate, and whole question will come back later on to its ongin. In a similar conversation on the following day, King Husein himself the Moslems from the Turks. On the 6th November, 1916, the telegram Sir R. Wingate for a reply to Abdulla , , ■ K^ate was once more laid down. His Majesty's Government's policy regarding the Oahphate as follows ;— . . ui jf that his own interests ' That it should be strongly impressed on the bhu n ■hat it should be st, ; 0 XVSate should be left open until the end of the require that the question of t i -, 1 &lt;■ p hr ; gt i all Powers, numbering among their ''' - Moslem world. ^ &lt;58 30674/10. „ ooiq«q/ir «/ l&lt;241b/lo^ A1 r\:uu»\ 70 242002/16. 71 221869/lb. 233117/16; see also 249121/16 (extract from A. Qilla ■ I iA reply in this sense was eventually conveyed to King Huseiu by Colonel Wilson.' 2 In his conversation with Colonel Wilson on the 2nd November i916, quoted above, the Sherif twice spoke of the Caliphate as being in abeyance, and mentioned that he possessed a book by a Wahabi authority in which this was demonstrated, and which he would publish if necessary. He developed this thesis further in a conversation with Captain Lawrence on the 2bth July 1917, 78 and the latter received the impression that he was genuinely averse from the idea of reviving the office in his own person. For the ' false Caliphate ' of the Osmanlis he would prefer, it seems, to substitute a spiritual leadership of Islam in his own family w r ith some such title as Amiral Muminin, if this were genuiuelv offered to him. His view appears to be that the spiritual leader of Islam should not aim at being the political sovereign of the whole Moslem world, but that the office should be combined with a small temporal sovereignty—for instance, over the Hejaz and its Holy Cities—in order to secure the holder of it the independence necessary to his position. In fact, according to this conversation, Sherif Husein aims at a position verv like that of the Papacy when it possessed the temporal power over the Estates of the Church. If this is the Sherif's real view, it is remarkably divergent from the chauvinistic trend of opinion concerning the Caliphate which seems to be more common among Moslems at present. And it remains to be seen how he would regard the title of Caliph if it were actually placed within his grasp. IMation of commitments under (viii) to British desiderata. His Majesty s Government have succeeded so far in making it clear that they egard the question of the Caliphate as a purely Moslem affair, without causing Sherif Husein to doubt their goodwill towards his aspirations in the matter. We have two purely negative desiderata—avoidance of offence on the one hand to ^ loslein opinion and on the other hand to the Sherif—which have to be reconciled with one another, and hitherto we have avoided committing ourselves in either direction in a way that would compromise us in the other.
