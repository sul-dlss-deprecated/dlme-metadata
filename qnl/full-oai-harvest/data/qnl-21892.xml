Bruce states that he went to Ahram to meet with the Prince, who had stopped there on his return to Sheeraz [Shiraz]. Bruce describes his initial meeting with the minister, before recounting his subsequent conversation with the Prince himself. The apparent reasons for the Prince postponing his expedition to Bahrain are the advanced state of the season and the Prince's suspicions regarding the sincerity of the Imam of Muscat [Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd]. Bruce states that he intends to send to His Royal Highness a suitable present to the amount of 4000 rupees.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000030#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
