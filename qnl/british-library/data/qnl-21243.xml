In the second para of this ^r.Williams makes the statement that the site of the seaplane station is three buoys laid off the shore south of the aerodrome, ihis statement is not quite correct,for, although, the R.A.F laid some buoys to the south-west, not the south,of the aerodrome these are no longer utilized and their condition is doubtful. r ihe anchorage invariably used both by flying boats and seaplanes consists of 2 buoys,which have recently been renewed,due east of the Palace in Khor Kaliya.

I appreciate tnat you have responsibilities in connection with the defence of inaia; ana 1 am sure that there will be no uifficulty in obtaining piPemission for service aircraft to land at .iuharraq before an agreement regaraing the use of the luUiiarraq neroarome is actually completed,provided that a request for permission to do so is made formally to the •^uler before their arrival- I iiopUjhowever,that in each case as Hong notice as is practicable will be / given/because it is undesirable,save in circumstances of real emergency,to make suacien requests for facilities. To do so woula be likely to give the impression to the Huler tnat his permission was being taxen for granted,ana so cause him to give with a sense of wrong a service which woula otnerwise,there is no aoubt,be renaered with pleasure. 3. x have stressed the necessity for giving formal notice because in tne tnird paragraph of your letter you say tiiat you wou.a be 'compelled to instruct the aircraft to land at ^lunarraq whether an agreement for the use of this Aerodrome was in existence or not 1 . In 1^29 the likelihood of seaplanes visiting Bahrain came to the Ruler f s ears though he had received noofficial intimation of it. He expressed surprise that no representations nad been made to him and asked that his official permission should be eskea before any seaplanes descended in his territory. He adaed,however, that this permission would willingly oe given. 4. aI though the attitude of the Bahrain Government is friendly ana the Ruler is willing to do all that he can to help us,Bahrain is not British territory; and to assume the right to land,or to cnan(;e the place on which landing was carrieu out^without an agreement or,in its absence,without formal permission, would not only give &amp; just ground for complaint tu a A Miler,but might well be a source of embarrassment to us in future years,especially in the event of other nations seeking passage for the service aircraft. i Moreover,it would be unwise to give the Persian Government any pretext for alleging before the League of Nations taat we ha¥^ committed any act of aggression against Baiirain,for that i§ a weapon which we may,in certain circumstances,desire to use against Persia.CONFIDENTIAL.

I agree generally to your proposal that negotiations for the use of MTJHARHAQ, Aerodrome by service aircraft should be post poned until the Imperial Airways* agreement has been settled, i 2. At the same time you perhaps are not aware that we have certain responsibilities for the re-inforcement of INDIA from this command. In fact, the Air Ministry has ordered that a practice re-inforcement with aircraft from this command to INDIA is to take place during the current year. Although I do not anticipate that -this flight will take place within the next three months, I wish to have all arrangements for it c omplete. % 3. A further point which I have not previously brought to your notice is that I might require, under some circumstances, to send heavy aircraft of the Victoria type down the Persian Gulf or beyond. I feel that in such an event I would not be justified in risking damage by ordering the use of MANAMA and I would be compelled to instruct the aircraft to land at MIJHARRAQ whether an agreement for the use of this aerodrome 8 was in existence or not. 4. I imagine that, in view of the friendly attitude of BAHRAIN towards the British Government, there would be no difficulty in obtaining permission for service aircraft to land at MTTFARR^ before an agreement is actually drawn up; but I would like confirmation from you on this point. I would naturally inform you* at the earliest possible moment of any intention of sending landplanes down the Gulf.■ . i- L 1SECRET . No; .

The 12,000 feet scale mosaic, though extremely interesting, is rather too small a scale to be of use for the purpose for which we require the photographs. The other two, 5,000 feet will be most useful and it would assist us very much if, as suggested in Wing Commander Oxland's letter, they make a mosaic photograph on 5000 feet scale of the area marked in the big nhotogranh. 4. The R. a .F . have taken so much trouble in the matter that I am loath to ask anything more, but if it could be done we should very much like to have one photograph, at 5000 scale, of the town of Hedd, on the long narrow promentory at the south end of Muharraq. island. When funds are available we propose organising a municipality tnere and making a road through the town and for this puroose an air photograph would be very useful.

This reduces the width of the road and is liable to cause traffic accidents - one has already taken place - and the stone is destroying the cement parapets, and no cement is available for repairing them. The Municipality is willing to allow thisstone to^ be kept on the municipal pier, north of the Naturs office and on the land south of the Naturs oil ice, the Secretary will willingly show these sites to the people concerned.

The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, the Political Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle, and the Air Officer Commanding [AOC] of the Royal Air Force, Iraq Command.Correspondence in the file falls into three areas:1. Correspondence from Government officials in London, dated 1929-32, relating to Bahrain Oil Company proposals for an aerodrome and seaplane base at Bahrain, and the disuse of an earlier seaplane station (folios 1B-7);2. Correspondence from February 1933 between the Political Residency and RAF Iraq Command, over the need for an aerodrome at Bahrain to reinforce Britain's defence of India. The Political Resident writes to the AOC to state that permission should be sought from the Sheikh of Bahrain before any planes are landed (folios 8-13);3. Correspondence from late 1933 relating to a request from RAF Iraq Command for the RAF to take aerial photographs of the aerodrome sites at Manama and Muharraq. The request is forwarded to Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, who approves permission. Belgrave requests that photographs of the town of Hedd (Muharraq) be taken, as these could prove useful for future town planning purposes (folios 14-20).After the file’s office notes (folios 22-23) there is an additional letter from Belgrave to the Political Agent, dated 7 June 1944; presumably a later addition to the file. The letter is a complaint from Belgrave, who writes that contractors working on the RAF buildings at Muharraq are depositing coral stone on both sides of the road, and causing a traffic hazard in the process (folio 25).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
