(TIPTON) LTD. TIPTON, ENGLAND Established in the year 1875, and equipped with’modern machinery. This Factory produces steel nuts in very large quantities, any blank nut from T s ¥ in. to 2 in. being supplied. Their specialities are Square and Hexagon Blank or Tapped Nuts, Faced Nuts for the engineering trade and small Cold Pressed Nuts. Special threads such as Whit worth, B.S.F., etc., can be supphed if required. This factory has for many years held contracts for all the important railways in the United Kingdom. IIARBISON BROS. (ENGLAND) LTD. MIDDLESBROUGH, ENGLAND Established in the year 1887. This firm is one of the largest producers in the United Kingdom of fine Steel Grit, which is manufactured under the most modern methods, and is used to remove sand ar scale from all types of castings and ironwork. The Grit is applied either by compressed air or by centri fugal force, depending on the size and type of work to be treated. The use of this product is more economical than the use of sand (as in ordinary sand-blasting), since 1 ton will do approximately the same amount of work as 20 tons of sand and is much less injurious to the health of the operatives.CLYDESDALE STAMPING CO. LTD. NETHERTON, ENGLAND Established in the year 1885. This factory specialises in Steel Drop Forgings up to 150 lb. in any design required. The range of products is very great; for instance, there are over fifty different parts for motor cars, such as cranks, levers and brackets, in constant production ; bicycle cranks, couplings for steel scaffolding, parts of bombs and shells, up to the largest sizes, are also manufactured. In addition, a considerable amount of hand forging and wrought iron work, such as banister rails and sign brackets is carried out. There is also a large battery of power presses for producing brass and steel pressings not exceeding 1 ft. square with a in. draw in large quantities, and a number of hand presses suitable for smaller work. Here again the range is very wide, but as examples we may mention metal caps, grease cups, oor clips, fittings for ammunition boxes, rakes and scoops for A.R.P., metal parts of bicycle reflectors and washers of many descriptions. A range of capstan lathes is installed for turning out any small brass and steel fittings required for parts of motors, refrigerators, pumping plants or any moving machines. There is also an electric welding plant for joining small metal parts and for butt-welding seams on such articles as steel bands.NEOX MANUFACTURERS UTW. ERDINGTON, BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND Established in the year 1932. This firm specialises in the manufacture of the most modern type of Neon Lighting Tubing, and can supply such tubing to any required design over a very wide range of colours. As an advertising medium and as an ornamental display, under circumstances in which artificial lighting is visible, this tubing is practically without a rival. By the use of appropriate backgrounds an advertising message can be conveyed by day as well as by night, and when the tubes are used to illuminate the outlines of a building, they are scarcely noticeable when not alight. The method employed in the manufacture of this Neon Tubing is entirely different, and a very material improvement on the old Mercurial Vapour System, in which faults so often occurred. Neon Manufacturers Limited guarantee their Tubing for three years, but the normal life has been found to be fiv years. These Tubes do not deteriorate in any way when not in use in any climatic temperatures. Some of the largest and most striking displays in London have been erected by this firm, which has also supplied signs for South Africa and the East. IKARTON CONDUITS LTD. BEEHIVE WORKS, WALSALL, ENGLAND Established in the year 1867, and recently refitted throughoutwith the most modern and up-to-date machinery. This factory specialises in the manufacture of high-class Conduit Tubing which has to be used under all modern building regulations to protect the electric cables carrying the current to all the various light and power points throughout a building. The sizes range from § in. to 2^ in., and meet the most exacting specifications. The Tubing is welded electrically, and the joint is so perfect that it is almost impossible to distinguish it and equally impossible to break it. This factory also produces all the fittings necessary for use in connection with this Tubing, such as bends, boxes, clips, couplings, elbows, saddles and tees, in any range or formation from | in. to 2^ in. Large stocks of both Tubing and Fittings are constantly maintained, ensuring the rapid execution of all orders. THE PREMIER ALUMINIUM UASTINfi 'O. LTD. HAYMILLS, BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND Established in 1919, this firm makes all types of Aluminium Castings, either from the pure Metal or from any Aluminium Alloy desired. Where only small quantities are required, the Castings are made in the ordinary sand moulds, but for large quantities Die Castings are used. The finest type of Castings are produced, and are used by the foremost manufacturers of Motor Cars, Aeroplanes, and other high-speed machinery, where strength and lightness are essential.WIIIGHT, ANIIERSOIV &amp; CO. LTO. GATESHEAD-ON-TYNE, ENGLAND Established in the year 1911. This firm is one of the big manufacturers of Structural Steel Buildings, and specialises in Aeroplane Hangars and up-to-date Factories and Warehouses of all descriptions.

BalIREH T ISLaJD T 7e hu.ve recently been in touch with the Federation of British Industries, regarding business prospects in Bahrein Island, und we believe that they have mentioned our questions to you, for they have suggested that we should write to you in case you can obtain further information to help us, through the British Consul General at Bushire. ./e are most anxious to share in some of the business which is coming iron Bahrein, but we do not quite know how to set about it as we have not a single customer or contact out there who might help us with local knowledge. »/e Want to make it clear that we do not regard Bahrein as a market with, a thriving general demand for asbestos cement goods, out we note with envy the several orders which hove recentlyjoeen placed in the United States by the California ..Stan dard, Oil Com pany, and we should like to make a bid for some of this business, if there is a reasonable chance of its being honuid anywhere but in the Unit'd States. In the course of our activities we naturally wish to keep in touch with all building enterprise for the purpose of considering our range of building materials, and in addition any schemes for the laying of watemains, as we are manufac turers of pressure pipes of asbestos cement. The California ^radian Standard Oil have recently placed orders for both asbestos cement rqo fing materials and asbestos cement pressure pip££, and for this reason Y;e' would like to find some firm' or organisation in Bahrein with an already established contact with the Oil Engineers. In this way we believe we could demonstrate locally the superiority of our goods, and thus do whatever was possible to cause enquiries to be circulated in this country as well. It is interesting to note , and we mention this confidentially for your information, that in the case of the recent pressure pipe order placed by these people, the .-jnerican manufacturers who secured the business, should, under the manufacturing rights, have refused to supply ana diverted the order to us, but by arrangement with them v/e allowed them to execute the business. You v/ill see, therefore, that as far as pressure pipes are concerned we are offering something equi valent to the American manufacturers, both being made under the same process, and we could if we wished, stop^Kd them from supplying. at the same time, if the enquiries are being har.dled in the States only,^ any hindrance which we might cause would only divert the business to some other class of pipe or to some other Manufacturer of an asbestos cement pipe made by another process, sc we should not be achieving very much. The main thing is that we should like to knov/ whether there is anyone locally in Bahrain v/ith whom we might establish contact, and thus, without making special Journeys we could find out whether local canvassing would divert some of 'die trade to this country. /If». it If you Cuii assist us, shall be very grateful, but we would mention that we know from the Mercantile Year Book that Lynch Brothers, ana Gray* Dawes and Company, are said to have local connections, but we are really looking for someone actually established over there.

The Department of Overseas Trade, Gheat George Street, London S.Y/.l. De«.r Sirs, for your promise to make some enquiries through H.M.Consul General at Bashire regarding the points which we raised about trade in Bahrein Island. v/e are sending you herewith three copies of e* snail com pendium v/hich we circulate, and which gives a fairly comprehen sive idea of our activities. We have more elaborate literature dealing with each product individually, but the compendium will, we think, be the best for your purpose as is will enable H.I1. Consul/ General to obtain a fairly goou impression of our Industry to assist him in his enquiries. Y/e hesitate to give prices, for several reasons. In the firstplace our range of manufactures is very extensive ana the preparation of price-lists in these items is not simple on account of changing costs, fluctuations^in freight rates, V/ar Risk Insurance, and all th£'oth6r items which go lo make C.I.F. prices. Moreover, it is our custom to fix our prices according to market demands as our Export policy is very different from our Home-Trade in as much as in selling our materials in markets riddled with competition, we obviously adopt a very dif ferent standard of price from markets where there is less inter ference. In fact, we are most anxious to maintain and expand our Export trade., and the question of profit on Overseas business is of very secondary importance. Would you therefore be good enough to explain to H.M. Consul-General that as the largest producers in the world of asbestos cement building materials, we are obviously marketing our manufactures at fair prices, and in any market where we discover severe foreign competition, it is always oui* endeavour to provide rates which will maintain interest in the British pro ducts . In the matter of *igency arrangements, we prefer Stockist Vendors as representatives, because in the Building Trade supplies must be available locally, and Commission ^igents are, therefore, almost useless. We normally appoint agents on the ’understanding that they can sell at whatever prices they can get, and we invoice to them at the lowest possible rates so that the full difference, after their expenses have been paid, is their profit. We realise, of course, that in Bahrein Islam conditions are a little different in as much as the potentialities of the market may be very restricted, and as our main aim is to contact the oil companies, we should be quiue willing to make an exception and, if necessary, appoint a Commission .igent as Representative, if that Commission .regent had the entree to the Oil Companies, as you know, we are very jealous of the business (of a considerable nature) v/hich is going to the United Bt^tes, and we should like to have some of it ourselves. Y/e thank you for your letter of yesterday's date, ana Y/e shall, therefore, be very grateful for your help Yours faithfully, for TURHLR3 *d$BB3T0S CCIEHT COMPANY. (Sd.)

There is at present no market in Bahrain for asbestos cement goods, except with the oil companies, and. it is unlikely that there will be for some time any other enterprise in which f-lessrs. Turners could demonstrate the value of their products. Sfojfreover the oil companies place their orders as much as possible direct, rather than through local merchants, and Messrs* Turners night therefore have more chance of success if they approached The Bahrain Petroleum Company or The Petroleum Concessions Limited through their London offices, or The California Arabian standard Oil Company through their head office, than if they relied on establishing contact in Bahrain.
