A great deal of correspondence in the file is dedicated to a search for supplies amongst British and Indian stores; supplies for obsolete aircraft such as the Hind were in short supply in the 1940s. Periodic lists of supplies required by the Afghan Air Force have been filed within, along with supplementary correspondence related to financing and shipping purchases to Kabul. Arrangements for the manufacture of new propellers in the United Kingdom (UK) for Afghanistan's Hind aircraft are also documented in the file.The main correspondents are British officials within the following departments: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office, the India Store Department, the British Legation at Kabul, and the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Afghan Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Counsellor, British Legation, Kabul</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Store Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Military aircraft</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hawker Hind (Bomber)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Arms sales</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000224#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000224#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000224#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
