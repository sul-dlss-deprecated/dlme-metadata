Awnings at the ground-floor level of the building on the right indicate that these may have been storefronts.The subject of this photograph is probably the same building identified in the drawing of a view inside the Masjid al-Haram (1781.b.6/2) as ‘front-side of the Hamidiyah’, indicating that the building – and therefore the viewpoint in this photograph – was probably situated south of the mosque.The style of the building is neo-classical with domed arches at the main portico as well as long square-shuttered windows on both floors. It was likely constructed during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876–1909) and was therefore relatively new at the time that this photograph was taken. To each side of the main entrance are iron railings and two gas-lamps.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:IVPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Die H̱amīdijjah (von Othman Pascha erbautes Regierungsgebäude).’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Historic buildings</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x00002b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
