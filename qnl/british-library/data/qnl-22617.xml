I had an Interesting conversation vith levies about oil In general and Aserlcans in Arabia in particular, levies tola me that the California ia-abisa standard u il Company ?ould i prefer to lay a pipeline across to Bahrain fchar\ to i-ux-ait, ie se« sed to think that oil would be struck on the coast very soon. I asked him if oil fas found inland tovards Kuwait »hetaer they would still wish to bring it to Bahrain or to Kuwait. He said that froE every point of view it would be . preferable to lay the pipeline to Bahrain. 2*Davies was quite out-spoken about Ainarican and British relations and extremely critical of the Anglo-Persiaa ^11 Company v.hoffi he biased entirely for having let them (the Americans) in. pae did n&amp;t think that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company stood a hope in Sa'udi Arabia. 3. Belgrave tells me that his wife attended a dinner in Jkmdon of the Central Asian Society at which amongst others v -ere present the following?- Lord ^loyd. Mr. Philby. Phllby said that oil ^oald be struck very soon in an unspecified place in Sa 1 ual Arabia but inferred that that ,1ace would be Hasa.

Certain indirect benefits would naturally accrue to the iiahrein Government if the terminal of the pipeline were situated in their territory, and, in addition, they might possibly secure from the Company a moderate payment ior the right to lay the pipeline; but I should doubt whether the Company would agree to pay the Shaikh anything in the nature oi a levy per ton of oil pumped.

My dear Alan, % I enclose copies of some correspondence 'between Bullard and a Mr. Wills, of Gray, Mackenzie and Company, and 'between Bullard and myself, which is, as Bullard says at the start of his first letter to me, self-explanatory. 2. Wills came to see me a day or two ago and confirmed generally what he had written to Bullard. Casoc had hitherto imported all their machinery, etc. for their work in Hasa through Bahrein, paying the Bahrein Government a duty of l^j for the privilege. They had not minded that much, because the amount of machinery involved was small. Now, however, that oil had been struck and they were going to develop an oil-field which they expected would soon he producing far more than Bahrein, they would need far larger imports and did not see their way to go on paying the duty. Hence the move to Has Tanurah. 3. Casoc do not, howevey want to have to rely upon a Saudi firm either for unloading their material or checking and passing it once it is unloaded. They particularly want Gray, Mackenzie to do this for them - at least so Wills says - and I cross-examined him on the point. According to him, their keenness overcame their reluctance to intervene in administration questions, with the result that the London office telegraphed to Jedda supporting strongly the firm's application. This had led to the half-concession already made hy the Saudi Government, which is that Gray, Mackenzie may do the lighterage of the goods and stores from the steamers lying off Ras Tanurah to the shore, hut that the crews of their lighters may not land. t, Esq., da.% kt • 4. This, so Wills said, was a possible, although highly inconvenient, arrangement so far as the labour side of the question was concerned. But it did not solve the problem of checking and passing the goods on shore. There was no such thing as a trained Saudi-Arabian tally clerk, even if the firm were willing to he represented exclusively 'by Saudi Arabians. For a start at least it was essential that a European manager and a Bahrein assistant should be allowed to live at the port. They were Quite willing to pay the Saudi Government the same 'fine 0 of 10% as they paid the Bahrein Government on the business which they handled. 5. Wills said he fully realised the natural reluctance of the Saudi Arabian authorities to complicate matters for themselves by allowing stray Europeans to live in places where their presence was not absolutely essential. He did not ask for representations or enquiries at this stage, assuming the Foreign Office were willing to make them, as he found that in these affairs it usually paid to take the line that the firm was working in the Saudi Arabian interest, wished to conform in every way to the requirements of the Saudi Arabian authorities, and to take things up direct with the authorities as a Saudi firm would. The difficulty, however, was how to get at these authorities. It was useless trying to do anything on the Hasa Coast and it was no use, according to Sir Reader Bullard, sending anyone to Jedda. 6. In the circumstances, he thought (since I had told him that there were no Ministers in the suite of the two Bmirs) that it would be well for him to go to see the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, tacitly assuming that the restriction on landing applied only to lighter cre¥/s, and ask for advice as to how his manager and assistant should proceed with regard to visas, local registration, etc. This would at least lead to an enquiry from the Minister, (i.e. from another quarter), reaching the Saudi Government, and probably the King/3. King himself. 7. I told Wills that in vie?/ of the difficulty of getting at the Saudis anyho?/ else, this seemed as good a course as any other, and he departed saying he would let me know how he got on. Yours ever, (Sd) Lacy Baggallay./1938 3 in Foreign Office Letter dated 26th August,1938. Bamburgh, Northumberland, fc38/25) 16th August,1938. My dear Baggallay, ■K / I enclose conies self-explanatory letters ,s which I have exchanged vnth a mernber of the firm of Gray, nal. Mackenzie and Co., whom I used to Snow in Basra before the I am always prepared to come to London for any urgent business, as you know, but I don't know that I could do any good with this affair at present. I suppose that the Eastern Department will be seeing the Saudis, and you will be able to judge whether to say a word about this to Hafiz Wahba or to Yusuf Yasin ~ if YY is indeed with the Amir. Ibn Saud is very touchy about Nejd, and anxious that it should remain really Arab* Moreover the Saudis naturally want to do as much as they can themselves, so as to keep the profits in the country. At the same time I can believe that the GA30C would prefer, for the sake of speed and security, to have their stuff handled by Gray Mackenzie rather than by Nejdi firms, and it would suit us to have Gray Mackenzie established on the mainland. Bahrain will be hard hit if it loses the transit trade to Saudi Arabia, but that is another question. We cannot stand in the way of the commercial development of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, we should assist Ibn Saud to acquire a port of his own, since he will then ce- se to have a grievance on this point, or at least his grievance will lose much of its force. You may wish to begin by seeing Wills. He is a tough business man with long experience of the Perisan w Gulf. If it seems essential for me to come to London before mid-September, either for this or for something else of importance, it can be arranged, preferably at the end of August; but I shall not be coming to London for fun. Yours ever, gal lay, ulsq., (3d- R. Bullard./438/85) 122, Leadenhall Street, London, E.G.3, 15th August, 1938. My dear Bullard, It is many years since we met, in fact I do not think I have had the pleasure of seeing you since the war. I trust you will forgive me for troubling you while on holiday, 'but I am very anxious to obtain your advice as to hov to act in a question which has arisen with the Saudieh Government. Our Company - Gray, Mackenzie Ltd. - has been acting as Landing and Clearing Agents for the Bahrein Oil Company and the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company in the Perisan Gulf, and up to the present all stores and material for these Companies have been transhipped at Bahrein since they started their activities there. It has now been decided that stores and material for C.A.3.0. GO will be taken in future direct by steamer to a new port which will be opened up in Saudi Arabia named Ras Tanurah, and the Oil Company are anxious that we should continue to do the clearing and landing work for them at this port. The Saudieh Government, however, is making difficulties and has suggested that two local Saudieh (Arab) firms could undertake this work. The Saudieh Government is also disinclined to allow a British Company to establish themselves at Has Tanurah. We have sunk a lot of Capital in barges and have ■ I a fully experienced staff and are very anxious to retain this work and to establish ourselves at Has Tanurah and act as Steamers Agents there in the same way as we do at Bahrein. We are considering the advisability of sending a European Assistant to Jeddah to see the Authorities there J in fact, it has been suggested that I might undertake tas mission, but you can understand I am not at all keen to do so now during the hottest months of the year. It is, ftrathi 11 ™ BUllard ' K - c: - M - G -' O-I-E., .-burgh, Northumberland.however, essential that we take up the matter at once. I see the Grown Prince is coming home and I am wondering if some of the Ministers Accompanying him could deal with this matter here. I might mention that the Galifornian Arabian Standard Oil Company are in their own interests pressing the 3audieh Government to leave the landing work in our hands as they fully realize that the Saudieh firms have neither the plant nor the experience to undertake it. Will you kindly let me know if you are coming down South shortly and if I can possibly see you. I shall be quite prepared to come up North ^ust to have a short meeting with you if convenient to you. I am looking forward to seeing you again, With kind regard Yours sincerely, (Sd) Charles Wills. \Bamburgh, N o rthumb e r1 and. 16th August,1938. I was very glad indeed to have your letter, and I hope to have a chance to see you soon, whether in connection ¥/ith the Has Tanura husiness or not. I ara staying here until ahout September 14th, when ¥/e return to Oxford, hut this does not preclude my going to London 'before then, if any urgent business crops up. I do not think it would pay you to come up here to discuss the subject of your letter at present. I am sending on your letter to the Foreign Office (Eastern Department), w&amp;o will know more about the Amir Saud's visit to England than I know at present. It might be possible, as you suggest, to speak a work to someone in the Amir's entourage, but I have not yet heard which of the Saudi officials is v/ith him; it mi^it be someone who has nothing to do with such matters. Or the Foreign Office might prefer to take it up, if they feel that they can help, in some other way. I am writing to Mr. Baggallay, who is in charge of the Eastern Department at the moment, and you may hear from him. (Sd) R.W.Bullard.

Gray, Mackenzie, to supplement the one 1 enclosed in my letter of the 16th. It makes the case clearer. The Saudi Government are obliged to admit foreigners to work the oil field in Hasa, hut they do not want a foreign company to establish itself on the Persian Gulf coast of their territory to run the work of landing material etc. I judge that political considerations underlie the decision, and that the Minister of finance could to nothing ahout it. If Gray, Mackenzie sent a man to Jedda, he would he in the hands of a jumped-up young Syrian, Najih Salha, who was a clerk ?/ith Gellatly Hankey a few years ago and is now Director of Public Works. This man has no power in such a matter as this, hut he might he a nuisance. If anything is to he done it will he necessary to approach the Saudi authorities higher up, and I think that it would he a good thing to mention the matter to Hafiz Wahha, after, perhaps, seeing Wills in order to get all the information he has to give and finding out that the CA30C really do want Gray Mackenzie to do the ?i /ork.

It would appear from this that the Government has not sanctioned our opening an office in Has Tanurah. Perhaps we might he ahle to arrange this in London, hut I shall he glad to have your advice and would much appreciate any assistance you can give us. In any case, we still think it advicahle to send a representative to Jeddah if the Government officials are there so as to get in touch with them.

ON the 27th May, 1933, an agreement was signed between the Saudi Arabian Government and the Standard Oil Company of California granting the company a concession for a defined area in Eastern Saudi Arabia corresponding roughly with the district of Hasa. An abridged text of this agreement was published at the time in the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura. What was believed to be a full text, consisting of thirty-four articles, was obtained in 1935 by the political agent at Koweit (E 3823/173/25 (1935-)).(') ■— ^ ^ ^ • 2. The Saudi Arabian decree announcing the grant of the concession contained, however, a reference to a 'special agreement,' which was not published. It was believed at the time that the '' special agreement'' gave the California Arabian Standard Oil Company an option on territory in Eastern Saudi Arabia not already included in the Hasa concession, but details were lacking. 3. In April 1938 the Saudi Arabian Legation in London communicated unofficially to the Foreign Office the text of three articles of an agreement relating to the Standard Oil Company's concession, together with a copy of a letter dated the 29th May, 1933, from the company's representative to the Saudi Arabian Minister of Finance. This letter refers inter alia to '' the contract signed to-day.'' The three articles and the letter deal with the particular question of the company's option rights outside the original concession area. 4. The three articles were numbered 3, 7 and 35. The Saudi Arabian Legation had no knowledge of the remainder of the agreement from which the articles are supposed to be taken, and it is, in any case, unlikely that there would be two complete, but entirely separate, agreements signed at about the same time and relating to the same subject. 5. The most probable explanation is that on the 29th May, 1933, a modified version of the original agreement of the 27th May was signed, and that this modified version consisted of the original agreement with the three extra articles and the interpretative letter. This is borne out by the fact that if the three additional articles are inserted in their proper places in the original agreement, the whole agreement reads consecutively. 6. The agreement has accordingly been reproduced below with the three articles inserted. The numbering of the other articles has been altered accordingly, i.e., article 3 in the original becomes article 4, article 5 becomes article 6, article 6 becomes article 8, and so on as far as article 32, which becomes article 34, after which the new article 35 supersedes the original article 33. Finally, article 34 becomes article 36. References to other articles have been altered to correspond with the new numbering. The letter has been placed at the did of ttlo qjptgoingilt 7. The 0 whole document is confidential, as no part of it has been communi cated officially to His Majesty's Government by the Saudi Arabian Government. Foreign Office, September 22, 1938. ( 1 ) 'Further Correspondence respecting Eastern Affairs, Part XXXVI, Enclosure in No. 68. 10067 [17968] Bmm j: r i following A rticle 1. Text of the Oil Agreement between the Standard Oil Company of Califo rn i and His Majesty King A hdul Aziz-al-Saud. THIS agreement made between his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Suleiman-al Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the ' Government '), of the one part and L. N. Hamilton, acting on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California (hereinafter referred to as the ' Company '), of the other part. It is hereby agreed between the Government and the Company in manner \ ( The Government hereby grants to the Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter mentioned, and with respect to the area defined below, the exclusive right, for a period of sixty years from the effective date hereof, to explore prospect, drill for, extract, treat, manufacture, transport, deal with, carry away and export petroleum, asphalt, naphtha, natural greases, ozocerite, and other hydrocarbons, and the derivatives of all such products. It is understood, how ever, that such right does not include the exclusive right to sell crude or refined products within the area described below or within Saudi Arabia. A rticle 2. The area covered by the exclusive right referred to in article 1 hereof is all of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Da liana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the I) ah an a the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia. For convenience this area may be referred to as the ' exclusive area.' A rticle 3. In addition to the grant of the exclusive area referred to in article 2 of this agreement, the Government also hereby grants to the Company a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance of eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. This preference right includes such rights as the Government may now have, or may hereafter acquire, in the so-called Neutral Zone bordering on the Persian Gulf to the south of Koweit. The nature of this preference right is to be hereafter agreed upon. The term oil concession '' as used in this article means an exclusive concession covering the same products which are covered by the present agreement. Furthermore, the Company's geologists shall have the right to examine the region covered by the preference right just referred to (excepting the Neutral Zone referred to above), in so far as such examination may be necessary or advisable for a better understanding of the geological character of the exclusive area. A rticle 4. Within the time agreed in article 18 of this agreement, the Company shall make a payment to the Government of £30,000 gold, or its equivalent. A rticle 5. The Company shall pay the Government annually the sum of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent. For convenience this payment is termed an ' annual rental ' ana it is payable in advance. The first annual rental shall be paid within the tiro 6 agreed in article 18 of this agreement; thereafter so long as the contract is terminated, the annual rental shall be due upon each anniversary of the effective3 date hereof, and shall be payable within thirty days after such anniversary, provided that upon the commercial discovery of oil no further annual rental shall be due or payable. A rticle 6. If this contract has not been terminated within eighteen months from the effective date hereof, the Company shall make a second payment to the Govern ment, amounting to £20,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of such payment shall be eighteen months from the effective date hereof, but the Company shall have fifteen days from the due date within which to make the payment. A rticle 7. During the life of this agreement, the Government shall be under no obligation to repay the initial loan of £30,000 gold (or its equivalent), or the second loan of £20,000 gold (or its equivalent). The Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these two loans by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. If the amount of the two loans, in whole or in part, shall not have been so recovered by the Company upon the termination of this contract, the Government shall repay the unrecovered amount in four equal and consecutive annual instalments, the first instalment to be paid within one year from the date of the termination of this agreement. Furthermore, until such unrecovered amount has been repaid by the Government, the Company's preference right referred to in article 3 hereof shall continue in force. A rticle 8. Upon the effective date of this agreement the Company shall commence plans and preparations for geological work, so planning the work as to take advantage of the cooler season for more efficient work in the field, and of the hotter season for the necessary office work of compiling data and reports. In the event the actual field work shall commence not later than the end of September 1933, and it shall be continued diligently until operations connected with drilling are commenced, or until the contract is terminated. A rticle 9. Within ninety days after the commencement of drilling, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such portions of the exclusive area as the Company at that time may decide not to explore further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. Similarly, from time to time, during the life of this contract, the Company shall relinquish to the Government such further portions of the exclusive area as the Company may then decide not to explore or prospect further, or to use otherwise in connexion with the enterprise. The portions so relinquished shall thereupon be released from the terms and conditions of this contract, excepting only that during the life of this contract the Company shall continue to enjoy the right to use the portions so relinquished for transportation and communication facilities, which, however, shall interfere as little as practicable with any other use to which the relinquished portions may be put. A rticle 10. The Company shall commence operations connected with drilling as soon as a suitable structure has been found, and in any event if the Company does not commence such operations within three years from the end of September 1933 (subject to the provisions of article 27 hereof), the Government may terminate this contract. Once commenced, these operations shall be continued diligently until oil in commercial quantities has been discovered or until this agreement is terminated. If the Company should fail to declare so sooner, the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities shall be the date upon which the Company has completed and tested a well or wells capable of producing in accordance with .first-class oil practice at least 2,000 tons of oil per day for a period of thirty consecutive days. Operations connected with drilling include the ordering and shipping of materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia, the construction of roads, camps, buildings, structures, communication facilities, &amp;c., and the installation and operation of the machinery, equipment and facilities for drilling wells. [17968] ^ b 24 A rticle 11. Upon the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall advance to the Government the sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent, and one year later the further sum of £50,000 gold, or its equivalent. The due date of the first advance shall be the date of discovery of oil m commercial quantities, as provided m article 10 hereof, and the due date of the second advance shall be one year later. In each case the Company shall have sixty days following the due date within which to make the advance. Both of these advances are in account of royalties, which may be due to the Government, and, consequently, the Company shall have the right to recover the amount of these advances by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. A rticle 12. Since it has been agreed that the annual rental of £5,000 gold, or its equivalent, is payable to the date of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities, and since it has been agreed also that the annual rental is to be payable in advance, it may happen that the last annual rental paid prior to the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities will cover a period beyond the date of such discovery. In case that this period should be equal to or greater than one- fifth of a year, the proportionate amount of the £5,000 gold, or its equivalent corresponding to such period, shall be treated as an advance on account of royalties due the Government, and consequently it should be recoverable by the Company by way of deductions from one-half of the royalties due the Government. A rticle 13. As soon as practicable {i .e., allowing a reasonable time for ordering and shipping further materials and equipment to Saudi Arabia and commencing further work), after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall continue operations connected with drilling by using at least two strings of tools. These operations shall continue diligently until the proven area has been drilled up in accordance with first-class oil-field practice, or until the contract is terminated. A rticle 14. The Company shall pay the Government a royalty on all net crude oil produced and saved and run from field storage, after first deducting— (1) Water and foreign substance; and _ ^ (2) Oil required for the customary operations of the Company's installation within Saudi Arabia; and (3) The oil required for the manufacturing the amounts of gasoline and kerosene to be provided free each year to the Government in accordance with article 19 hereof. The rate of royalty per ton of such net crude oil shall be 4s. gold, or its equivalent. A rticle 15. If the Company should produce, save and sell any natural gas, it will pay ^ the Government a royalty equal to one-eighth of the proceeds of the sale of sucli natural gas, it being' understood, however, that the Company shall be under no obligation to produce, save, sell, or otherwise dispose of any natural gas. It 18 also understood that the Company is under no obligation to pay any royalty on such natural gas as it may use for the customary operation of its installation within Saudi Arabia. A rticle 16. The Government, through duly authorised representatives, may, during the usual hours of operations, inspect and examine the operations of the C 0111 ! 3 ^ v under this contract and may verify the amount of production. The Oomp ^ shall measure, in accordance with first-class oil-field practice, the amount o produced and saved and run from field storage, and shall keep true and coraccounts thereof, and of the natural gas it may produce and save and sell, and duly authorised representatives of the Government shall also have access at all reasonable times to such accounts. The Company shall within three months, after the end of each semester, commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, deliver to the Government an abstract of such accounts for the semester, and a statement of the amount of royalties due the Government for the semester. These accounts and statements should be treated as confidential by the Govern ment, with the exception of such items therein as the Government may require to publish for fiscal purposes. The royalties due the^ Government at the end of each semester commencing with the date of commercial discovery of oil, shall be paid within three months after the end of the semester, such portion of the amount as may be unquestioned shall be tendered the Government within the period hereinabove, and thereupon the question shall be settled by agreement between the parties or failing that by arbitration as provided in this contract. Any further sum which may be payable to the Government as a result of this settlement shall be paid within sixty days after the date of such settlement. A rticle 17. It is agreed that all gold payments provided in this contract, whether pounds gold or shillings gold, are to be based on the gold pound standard according to its weight and fineness at the time the payment may be due. It is also agreed that wherever it is stipulated in this contract the equivalent of any sum or amount in pounds gold or in shillings gold may be paid, such equivalent may be in dollars in United States currency, or pounds sterling. It is agreed, furthermore, that the equivalent of pounds gold or shillings gold, for any payment which may be made hereunder in dollars. United States currency or in pounds sterling (with the exception of the first payment provided for in article 18 hereof), shall be based on the average of the rate of exchange as computed over a period of three months immediately preceding the due date of the payment. A rticle 18. All payments provided in this contract to be made to the Government may be made by tendering such payment directly to the Government, or by depositing the amount due to the credit of the Government in some bank which the Govern ment designates in writing, and which the Government may change from time to time by giving written notice to the Company long enough in advance, so that Company will have sufficient time to make future payments to the new bank. It is agreed that Government will designate such bank in Saudi Arabia, or in the United States of America, or in England, or in Holland, but that no bank in Saudi Arabia will be so designated unless such bank has a correspondent in United States of America, England or Holland, through which bank transfers of money to Saudi Arabia may be made. Once the Company has made the proper payment to the Government or has deposited the proper sum to such correspondent for transfer to a bank in Saudi Arabia, the Company shall be free of all further responsibility in connexion with payment. It is agreed, however, that the first payment of £35,000 gold, or its equivalent (comprising the first payment and the first annual rental), shall be made, within fifteen days after the effective date of this agreement, to a correspondent in New York or in London, of Netherlands Trading Society (Nederlandsche Handel- Maatschappij) at Jedda, Saudi Arabia, to be transmitted without delay, and at the expense of the Company, to said society and to be delivered to the Government upon obtaining a proper receipt from the Government for such payment. If this first payment is not made in gold, it will be made in pounds sterling at the current rate of exchange at the time the Company makes the payment to such correspondent. A rticle 19. A.S soon as practicable after the date of discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the Company shall select some point within Saudi Arabia for the erection of a plant for manufacturing sufficient gasoline and kerosene to meet the ordinary requirements of the Government, providing, of course, that the character r 17968] b 36 of the crude oil found will permit of the manufacture of such products on a com mercial basis by the use of ordinary refining methods, and provided further that the amount of oil developed is sufficient for the purpose. It is understood that the ordinary requirements of the Government shall not include resale inside or outside of the country. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary arrangements, and as soon as the Company has obtained the Government's consent to the proposed location, the Company shall proceed with the erection of such plant. During each year following the date of completion of this plant, the Company shall offer free to the Government, in bulk, 200,000 American gallons of gasoline, and 100,000 gallons of kerosene, it being understood that the facilities provided by the Government for accepting these deliveries shall not impede or endanger the Company's operations. A rticle 20. The Company, at its own expense, will employ the necessary number of guards and guides to protect its representatives, its camps and installations. The Government promise to co-operate fully in supplying the best soldiers and men available for this responsibility, and in furnishing every reasonable protection, at rates not exceeding those customarily paid by the Government or others for similar services, it being understood that the expense for such services shall be paid by the Company through the Government. * A rticle 21.

It is understood, however, that the use of aeroplanes within the country shall be subject to a separate agreement. The Company shall also have the right to develop, carry away and use water. It likewise shall have the right to carry away and use any water belonging to the Government, for the operations of the enterprise, but so as not to prejudice irriga tion or to deprive any lands, houses or watering places for cattle, of a reasonable supply of water from time to time.

A eticle 23. The enterprise under this contract shall be directed and supervised by Americans, who shall employ Saudi Arab nationals as far as practicable, and in so far as the Company can find suitable Saudi Arab employees it will not employ other nationals. In respect of the treatment of the Saudi Arab nationals as employees, the Company shall abide by the existing laws of the country applicable generally to employees of any other industrial enterprise.

Any controversy which may arise as to whether or not the Company has committed the alleged breach shall be settled by arbitration in the manner provided in this agreement.

The effective date of this contract shall be the date of its publication in Saudi Arabia, following the notification of this contract by the Company. A rticle 35. This contract has been drawn up in English and in Arabic. Inasmuch as most of the obligations hereunder are imposed upon the Company and inasmuch as the interpretation of the English text, especially as regards technical obligations and requirements relating to the oil industry, has been fairly well established through long practice and experience in contracts such as the present one, it is agreed that while both texts shall have equal validity, nevertheless, in case of any divergence of interpretation as to the Company's obligations hereunder, the English text shall prevail. A rticle 36. It is understood that the contract, after being signed in Saudi Arabia, shall be subject to ratification by the Company at its offices in San Francisco, California, before it shall become effective. After both texts of this contract have been signed in duplicate in Saudi Arabia, the signed copies shall be sent by registered mail in the next out-going mail to the Company in San Francisco, California, and within fifteen days after receipt in San Francisco the Company shall transmit to the Government by telegraph whether or not it ratifies this contract. If the contract is not ratified by the Company within fifteen days after that period, it shall be null and void and of no further force or effect. Likewise, if the amount of the first payment and the first annual rental is not made within the time agreed upon in article 18 hereof, the Government may declare this contract to be null and void and of no further force or effect. Upon ratification of this contract by the Company, one signed copy of each text, together with the necessary evidence as to ratification by the Company, shall be returned to the Government. Also upon ratification of this contract by the Company, the contract shall be published in Saudi Arabia in the usual manner. Signed this 29th day of the month of May 1933. Letter to Ms Eoocellency Sheikh Ahdulla Suleiman- aL-H amdan. Dear Sheikh Abdulla, 29, 1933. REFERRING to the contract which has been signed to-day by you, on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government, and by the undersigned, on behalf of Standard Oil Company of California, relative to an oil concession covering a portion of Eastern Saudi Arabia, I am setting forth below the agreement we have also reached on behalf of the two parties to the same contract, which agreement shall10 be considered as a part of the said contract. For convenience, the two parties in question shall be referred to below in the same manner as designated m the said contract, namely, the ' Government ' and the ' Company, and the said contract shall be referred to as the ' Saudi Arab Concession.' 1 The Company is granted a preference right to an oil concession coverina a certain area described in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The preference right so granted the Company shall be a right to acquire an oil concession covering such area exclusive of the so-called Neutral Zone also referred to in the same article 3, by equalling the terms of any offer for such concession that may be made the Government by others in good faith and that the Government may be willing and ready to accept. Within thirty days after receiving from the Government written notice, setting forth in full the terms of such offer, the Company shall notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession by equalling the terms so offered. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to accept the offer made, but if an oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those so offered and so presented to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continue, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 2. The Company's preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession, shall be a right to equal, with respect to the rights of the Government in the Neutral Zone, the terms and conditions which may be obtained by the Sheikh of Koweit for a concession covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. In the absence of any grant of an oil concession covering such rights of the Sheikh of Koweit, the Government will endeavour to reach an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit whereby the Company will be permitted to acquire an oil concession covering the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone. In either of these two events, the Company shall have a period of thirty days from the date it receives written notice setting forth in full the terms and conditions of the oil concession covering the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, or covering the terms of the proposed _ concession embracing the rights of the Government and of the Sheikh of Koweit in the Neutral Zone, as the case may be, within which to decide and to notify the Government whether or not the Company wishes to acquire the oil concession on such terms. If the Company does not wish to do so, the Government is free to negotiate with others, but if the oil concession should not be granted to others on the same terms as those offered to the Company, the preference right of the Company shall continne, at least so long as the provisions of article 7 of the Saudi Arab Concession remain in force. 3. The consent of the Government must be obtained before the Company shall have any right to examine the so-called Neutral Zone referred to in article 3 of the Saudi Arab Concession. 4. The provisions of article 35 of the Saudi Arab Concession shall also apply to this agreement.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 655-3 of 1938.

I am not quite sure what this means, for there is no information here of their attempting to open an agency them*, selves in Bahrain, though admittedly when Wengoborski was here he did ask Campbell of Gray Mackenzie some questions about launches and lighters. However he concluded his conversation with Campbell by saying something to the effect that Gray Mackenzie seemed to have things pretty well under their control, and I very much doubt if we shall find the Hansa Line trying to establish an agency of their own. If they did they would find themselves up against a good deal of trouble since Gray Mackenzie and Yusuf Fanoo share a sort of lighterage monopoly and no one else can land stuff from the steamers* 3. We have still no information here whether Gray Mackenzie are going to get the v tas Tanura agency, the impediment being the extravagant demands by the Saudi Government.

Enclosure in Foreign Office Covering Note Dated 15th February 1939, (E 1014/992/91) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.I. IMMEDIATE . 15th February, 1939, i 1 /1 ▼ m k | i Dear Burkett, / / ' I write in reply to your letter No.S,49699/D.0.C.A. of the 6th February to Baggallay, who is away. I am not clear from Colonel Burchall's letter exactly what is proposed. It seems possible that Imperial Airways may have it in mind to send a representative, or a small party, to visit parts of Saudi Arabia in the neighbourhood of Bahrain, in order to help the Standard Oil Company of California to lay out landing grounds in that neighbourhood and to erect wireless stations there. If this is what is intended, we are strongly of opinion that the British Company's representative or representatives should not seek to visit Saudi Arabia for these purposes without the knowledge and consent of the Saudi Arabian Government. We have good reason to believe that the Saudi Arabian authorities are in general reluctant to allow any British enterprise to work in that part of Saudi Arabia, They are rather suspicious of anything which they may regard as an attempt to extend British influence in the Persian Gulf area. Thus it is quite possible that the Saudi Arabian authorities, if asked for permission for Imperial Airways representatives to visit that part of Saudi Arabia, would refuse their consent. And if Imperial Airways were to send people, without the knowledge of the Saudi Authorities, the latter would no doubt object very strongly if they got to hear of it later. On the other hand, it is possible that Colonel Burchall only means to supply the Standard Oil Company of California with Esq. , O.B.E. , M.C. , advice/ Air Ministry.2, advice based on the information already in the possession of Imperial Airways, and there is no objection, so far as the Foreign Office are concerned to their doing this. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gihson at the India Office, Yours sincerely, Sgd. James Bowker (for C.W. Baxter),&gt;y [014/992/91) )699/D. 0. C. A Department of Civil Aviation, Air Ministry, Ariel House, Strand, London, W.C.2, 6th February, 1939, Dear Baggallay, ^ f I am enclosing a copy of a letter which I have received from Colonel Burchall, General Manager of Imperial Airways Limited, with regard to the possibility of air activities in Arabia at the instance of the Standard Oil Company, We should be glad to know as soon as possible whether, from the political angle, you agree that Imperial Airways should offer their advice and assistance in this matter. If, and when, the actual developments take place it would, subject to what you may say, seem desirable that they should be in the hands of a British, rather than a foreign, air undertaking. I am asking the Air Staff for their views on the defence aspect. Yours sincerely, Sgd. W,W.Burkett Baggallay, Esq, , Foreign Office, 3. W. 1,./344, 1RET. Imperial Airways Limited, Airway Terminus, Victoria Station, S.W. 1. 2nd Fetor'aary, 1939, Dear Burkett, You doubtless know that the Standard Oil Company of California have an oil concession close to Bahrein, They also have extensive areas in Arabia over which they can prospect for oil. During a recent talk with people of the Standard Oil Company, it appeared that they are interested in the use of aircraft in Arabia. At the moment, they feel that they could usefully employ aircraft between Bahrein and the area on the mainland in which they are now drilling, I understand that their chief office in this part of the world is at Jedda, and that they have frequent convoys across the desert from Bahrein to Riadh and Jedda, and now use desert lorries. Communication from Bahrein to Jedda by air would 'be a great asset to them. Similarly, if they find oil in the centre of Arabia, they might also need air services operating to the Horth and South of this main route. The Standard Oil Company have heard of the successful way in which we have carried out work for the Iraq Petroleum Company in Palestine, and on aerial surveys, and they have therefore asked our advice as to the practical possibility of such aerial developments. They seem anxious to have our opinion and advice in regard to;- (a) Laying out the necessary landing grounds* (b) Erection of wireless stations, (c) Erection of camps at certain aerodromes. t (d) Specifications of aircraft that we consider suitable for their purposes, and (e) Some idea of capital and operating costs. Burkett, Esq., O.B.E. , M.C. , A ir Ministry, Ariel House, W.C.2, it/I \ k lj i 2. It is possible that they have asked similar questions from, other people, and I should he glad to know whether the Government have any wishes as to whether we should help them. You will remember that I wrote to you a few days ago, saying that the Deutsche Luft Hansa were sending a machine, with the German Ambassador in Baghdad on board, to Riadh and Jedda, and it seems to me possible that if we were not to undertake this work for the Standard Oil Company, some foreign help which the British Government might dislike, might be called in, As you know, we have our hands rather full at the moment, but there may be a political aspect of ^ust as much as the commercial* Before going any further, therefore, with the Standard Oil Company, I shall be very glad to have your views. I ought to add that the Standard Oil Company have stressed to us the need for keeping the matter entirely confidential, and are most anxious that the Government Authorities at Jedda should not learn that this project is under investigation. May we therefore ask you to treat the matter both with urgency and secrecy. Yours sincerely, Sgd. He Burchall#\ , i vi i .15 o/5 o enclosure in Air Ministry covering note dated 21st Fe'bruarv, 19 39 . L A IP. ivIIlTISTRY, 99/A.D.C.0.1. 21st Peloruary 1939 Dear Burchallj Will you please refer to your letter to Burkett of the 2nd February (reference GM1/344) about the desire of the Standard Oil Company of California to obtain your assistance in regard to air services between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia. I discussed this with you on the telephone this morning and you informed me that what you envisaged was that, if you were able to give the Standard Oil Company technical advice on the matters set out in the fifth paragraph of your letter,- they might then charter your planes for a commeicial private service. There was, however, you thought, no question of your Company being asked to send representatives to Saudi Arabia to survey the ground or to obtain the necessary permits from the Saudi Arabian Government. All this would you imagined be undertaken by the Oil Company themselves. This would dispose of the only difficulty which the Foreign Office, whom we have consulted, foresaw. The Foreign Office believe that the Saudi Arabian authorities are in general reluctant to allow any British enterprise to work in that part of Saudi Arabia which is in question, since they are rather suspi cious of anything which they may regard as an attempt to eztend British influence in the Persian G-ulf area. Thus it is quite possible that the Saudi Arabian authorities, if asked for permission for Imperial Airways representatives to visit that Dart of Saudi Arabia, would refuse their consent, and if m _ ||kII Imperial Airways were to send people, without the J 'now!edge of the Saudi authorities, the latter would no doubt object very strongly if they got to hear of it later. T' / ■ v Col. h . Eur chall, I). S . 0. , Imperial wa,y s , airways Terminus, Victoria Station, S.Y/.l. f &gt; I fI pass on these observations for your information lout5 as I hfve saicl, the aoove difficulty appears unlikely to arise. That being so5 not only have we no objection to your assisting the Standard Oil Company in any way in your power5 but we should very much like you to do so5 so far as you feel able oecause we feel that it is most undesirable that they should seek the assistance of any foreign country (as I gather thuy would be likely to do if your assistance was not forthcoming) and thereby enable that foreign country to obtain a foothold in Saudi Arabia.

If I have the ;iono\ii/to amplify the information 0^ 18^ contained in m ■ telerrameWos* -yQ&amp;l- of l;overa'ber 24th and of Moveriber 30th, regarding the desire of Ibn Saud to see the proposed 3audi-Kmv;ait A- reement enter into force as soon as possible. 2* The Kin-: raised the subject himself, and this added to the interest of the fr-ct that I rind never 'before found the Saudi authorities anxious that the agreement shonld be concluded soon. The King said that is .•■?ish to conclude the Agreement was due partly to a recent increase in the amount of smuggling on the Saudi -Kuv *ait border, but mainly to the fact that he wanted to make customs and preventive arrangements for the port of Has 'Tar ura, and that the arrangements adopted there would depend to some extent upon whether the proposed Agreement with Kuwait was concluded or not. This second of the two reasons may have some weight in the King's mind, but since we reason to expect that the establishment of a Saudi port at Has Tanura would make him even more indifferent to Kuwait as a port of entry for his territory, it seems probable that other causes too are at work, and it seems to me that among them are the three set forth below. 3. it may be that the prospects of Res Tanura now seem less favourable than they were farther or-.. Mr. Charles v#ills, of the well-known firm of Gray Mackenzie and p * ' ( Company/ jl] tight Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K. ., . .c . ;c • c. h V m^ s. Company, who is at present in Jedda negotiating for permioBion to estaolish an oiTico at Has Tanura, considers that the Saudi hopes 'based on Ras Tamira have 'been far higher than the ciroTimstances ever warranted. He helives that the: r have even at times envisaged RasTauura as an enormous entrepot,serving as a port of transit for Bahrain and thus reversing the presentnosition so galling to . ■ t Send; whereas in his opinion there is no need to have wharves and warehouses at Ras Tanura or indeed to land cargo there at all: it can 'best he used, he maintains, es a deep-water anchorage where tankers can take oil from the Hasa oil-field, and cargo for Saudi Arabia can he transhipped into 'barges for despatch under tow to A1 Khubar and elsewhere, for the oil field, and to Uqair, for Hofuf and Riyadh. It is interesting in this connection to G:ote Fuad Bey Hams a, who returned from Iraq., via. Kuwait, while I was at Riyadh. He spoke of the nearness of Kuwait to Riyadh 'by car, and pointed out that for a person travelling from Riyadh 'by car, it took no longer to reach Besra, with its air-lines connecting with Europe and the Bast, than Hofuf. This is true, and the traveller at Hofuf is still a ? difficult day*s journey 'by car from Ras Tanura. It may he, then, that the Saudi authorities recognise that even if Ras Tanura can he made into a good port, it is mot very convenient as to situation. 4. rbn Saud is also woriled about Iraqi designs on Kuwait - another subject which he brought up during ray visit. I gave reasons for believin that Kuwait would -ot easily be cwallowed up by Iraq, but the King may think that the position of Kuwait would be stronger if he had signed the proposed agreement, which would tend to show that Saudi Arabia/ril Arabia and not Iraq is the proper hinterland of Kuwait* It is natural that Ibn Saud should not want to see his territory shut off from Kuwait 'by the relatively pov/erful state of Iraq. 5* Finally, Ihn Saud ma:' wish to see the personal position of the Shaikh of Kuwait strengthened. He spoke to me one day about the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Bahrain - his traditional connection with then, his personal aynpathy with then as fellow Arab rulers, and his re, et at recent events which mirht have daraa ed their prestige, e .g. the riot in Bahrain, wilch he attributed to Persian machinations, and the appointment in Kuwait of a council com osed of elements which vere not all, he thought, of the highest quality. He said that he apologised if he was stepping outside his jurisdiction (I had indeed made eome deprecating remarks), but he felt very strongly on the subject. It s emed to rae that the King felt that his own position was affected by the recent constitutional change in Kuwait, and thought it was time for Arab rulers to help one another. 6. Whatever the motives behind the King's request for the speedy conclusion of the proposed Agreement, I hope, as I said in the second of the two above-mentioned telegrams, that we shall seize the opportunity. 7.

I arrived back at Bahrein late on Friday night after a visit- to Haaa lasting 4^ days# As I v/ent across as the' guest of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in order to be shown something of the work that the Oil Company is doing across \ I there, I think it will be appropriate for my report to be in demi-official rather than official form. covered nearly 1000 miles In four days' travelling, and naturally my observations had to be of a very general nature. 2« I arrived at Dharan on the evening of the 15th May, having had slight trouble with the Police and Customs at A1 Khobar since they had succeeded in misplacing the letter of authority for me to lend and to receive customs facilities. It is some 14 months since I last saw Dharan and the, development and expan sion there during this time have been enormous. They now have six wells producing, or on the point of producing, from the deep horizon, and they have just started work on well No# 17 (in numberliag their wells they include the old shallow horizon wells which were almost totally unproductive). The American personnel numbers close on 300 and the construction of air-condi tioned houses, mess hall, commissary, etc., proceeds apace. It was a little difficult to ascertain figures of actual and potential production at Dharan but I gather that a minimum daily production of 10,000 barrels is already assured, and that potential production is not likely to be short of 30,000 barrels. There are five 'strings of tools' working at present at Bharan, plus/- Sonourable Lieutenant Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B,^. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.plus one at Abu Hadrlya C see belov), and I understand that when drilling begins In other areas rigs and draw-works will be moved out from Dharan, work at that place easing 3m On Tuesday morning we set out from Dharan via Qatlf and Safvm to Ras Tanura. The road follows the pipeline most of the way though the latter cuts across shallow water in •y ' V ■' ' ' . |l •a' Tanura Bay# A%Has Tanura I saw the storage tanks and the loading terminal, which is only 3000 feet from the shore. In fact Has Tanura is an admirable oil port, though the Company hope that it will not be developed for general Saudi purposes* There is ample space on the headland for a large refinery, should it become necessary to build one, though there is little doubt that the Company will do their best to avoid this# I should imagine that their hope that Ras Tanura will not develop as a general port is likely to be fulfilled, since the country between 'Ms Tanura and Eiyadh is extremely difficult for road construction. Presumably however cargoes for Qatlf and Oqair (for the Kofuf area) will be brought into Has Tantira and there loaded into barges and dhows • But the Fdyadh area will probably depend on Kuwait* 4, From Has Tanura we proceeded along the east side of the Sabakhat as Summ to Jubail. As we arrived there at mid-day most of the bazaar was shut, but it is a place of quite minor importance, providing mainly for the Bedu when they come into || the 'as sudah' to the west# From Jubail we continued more or less parallel to the Coast in a north-westerly direction to Abu Hadrlya, which lies at the intersection of lines drawn due south from Jebel Manifa and due west from Jinna Island. Abu Hadriya is the area which was proved last year by the seismograph method and which the Company hope will develop Into a huge oil field comparable with the A.I.O.C. fields. The first well is at present being drilled and casing has been set to a depth of 4800 /•4800 odd feet. The Company are prepared to drill to 10j000 feet in this area, and hope to find oil at any depth between S000 and 10|000 feet# Materials for work here are landed from barges in Manifa Bay where the Company have a crane in charge of a local watchman and crew. There is en excellent water supply at Ahix Hadriya and a very business-like air-cooled caup on a miniature scalej which of course will expand rapidly if oil is found in the teat well. 5. vv e then went on to Jebel ICanifa., from which we obtained a view of the surrounding country and could see Manifa Bay itself. There is deep water right up to the shore s but the difficulty here is that there are shoals further out to sea through which no deep water channel has yet been discovered. As it was now late in the afternoon we could only spend a short time at Jebel Manifa before driving on to No. 1 Seismograph Camp, which is at a point roughly 22 miles due west of Jebel Abu Hasain. (Incidentally I am quoting names which are shown on Hunter's Map of Arabia. I have a map of Hasa which was given to me by Thornburg, but it does not contain the details obtained during the present season's work. I hope in due course to get a revised map which may be ready in August.) We arrived at this Camp after dark, having covered some 240 miles during the day. There is a party of 16 men here engaged on seismograph work, and the Camp itself and the commissariat are alike admirable. 6. On the following morning, Wednesday, we started off by driving down to the Coast to obtain a view of the coast line between inas al Misha'ab and Ras al Safaniyah. This Is a parti cularly pleasant bay, but of no great interest. We then re turned and watched the seismograph party for some time (I will not worry you with an account of their technique), and afterwards proceeded /-•4- i t 4.' i proceeded north to the a in al Abd which, as far as I can make out, is about 16 or 17 miles from the Coast, and 3 or 4 miles : f i _ 1 • , . ; ^ , r , ■ ' i i. south of the Kuwait Neutral Sone boundary. This is a particular- ly unpleasant sulphurous salt spring, of no value to any one. we then travelled due west parallel with the Kuwait Eeutral Zone boundary (so far as we could judge where the boundary is), crossing the Kuwait-Riyadh road and driving along over the gravel plain in the general direction of Hafar al Batin. As we had a long Journey to make to the next camp we went only about 20 miles west of the Kuwait road (reluctantly deciding that there was insufficient time to drive in to Kuwait to see you) and we then turned south-east and joined the Kuwait-P.iyadh road. All this area of so-called gravel plain is covered with grass this year and I gather that most of the 3edu tribes who would ordinarily be down in the 'as sudah' by this time are still up in the Dlbdibsh area. They are beginning to come in now but we saw very few of them, and for this reason, as well . ss the great distances we were covering daily, I had no oppor tunity of making enquiries about the tribes and their migrations. By tiiis time we were out of the area which has been covered by Ho. 1 Seismograph Party, whose work has been roughly in a rect angle south of the Neutral Zone boundary with its south-westerly point not far from VJabrah. Crossing the adi-es- ]haqq we cut off from the Kuwait road before reaching the new Saudi fort at Qarya-al-Alya (about 23 miles west -north-west of v ,abrah), since we had no time to waste on explaining ourselves to the Saudi troops there. I am not quite sure how strong t-iis post is, but the American geologist who was our guide said he thought ' ' ' • J ' there would be 100 men. We proceeded in a south-south-westerly direction to 3eismog£aph Csmp No. 2 which is about 14 miles north-west of Sarrar. This involved a difficult cross-country journey after dark from the Company 1 s more northerly net-work of tracks to the southerly net-work in the Sarrar area. This camp/- !cafflp is on very much the same lines as the other v ?n&lt;S is due to move southwards in a few Says* time. We had covered roughly 260 miles ©f n road n and had to go back 45 miles after dinner' in order to repair and 'brinij m our second car t 7. The next day, Thursday, we struck west-south-west over gradually rising country to an area called Ba»aqala. This is on the edge of the Dehana (sand-dune country) about 50 miles west-south-west of Awainah# /walnah is the last point at ■which (so far) there is permanent water until th« Humah wells on the west side of the Dahana are reached. At Ma* aqala we found a geologists 1 camp of a somewhat more primitive nature. A driller has arrived there recently and is now drilling for waterj a necessary preliminary to drilling for oil next autumn in an area which has caused the geologists some excitement. This Ma, 1 aqala area is rather too herd for seismograph work but surface geology is considerably simpler than in the sand-covered areas and has been checked by the gravitymeter method. Ma 1 aqala is only 140 odd miles short of Hiyadh and it will be an expen- . sive business to construct and maintain roads to take heavy loads of machinery, etc., from lharan or Jubail. There is another geological party working about 90 miles north-north--.vest of Ma* aqala in the As Safah direction, but we did not have time to visit them. Ma'aqala is several hundred feet above sea level and very hot end dry; the temperature in the afternoon we were there was 115 in the shade, and is likely to go a good deal higher. 8. On the nesjt morning, Friday, we set out on our return journey to Dheran. As far as Awainah we were retracing our steps of the previous day, but from there on we followed a different track past Hinnat (Eanna) straight to Jubail, and thence southwards on the west side of the Sabakhat as Sunun to oharan. This distance was close on 250 miles and we used 25 gallons A| -6- gallons of water In the radiators of our two cars. Shortly before sighting )atlf we saw the abandoned derrick of a dry well drilled at a place called Al Alat (In the area named Sabakhat Salallyat in Hunter's Map). 9# Briefly the position In regard to Hasa oil Is that the Company have a prolific high-pressure field at Dharan which they are developing rapidly. This field may be good for 30 to 50 thousand barrels daily but will probably not be produced at anything like this figure owinj to the difficulty of breaking further into the markets of the Sastern Hemisphere. They ere drllllog a test well in an extremely promising area at Abu Hadriya, which may conceivably be a structure of far greater capacity than Dharan. They are about to begin drilling next cold weather (assuming that they surmount the water diffi culty) in the Ma'aqala area, which according to surface indica tions is extremely promising. Of their two seismograph parties Ho, 1 is covering a large area to the south of the Kuwait Neutral Zone which is promising enough but in which, as far as I can dis cover, no specific 'highs'' or domes have so far been located; the second seismograph party in the Sarrar area seams to have located a number of 'highs', judging by a detailed geological map of which I caught a glimpse. Another geological party In the As -3afah area does not seem to have much to report yet. Meanwhile two gravltymeter parties are starting work now to the south and south-west of Dharan, though it may be months before they can send in a useful report. ' I I . ' ; ' V :k- . . 10. I tried to find out something about the California Arabian Standard Oil Company's future policy, since it is a matter which has caused me much anxiety in recent months owing to its possible effect on Bahrain production, I suggested to Thornburg that the feverish activities at Dharan, the rather noisy boasting by Lenahan and others about Abu Hadriya, the intensive exploration by seismograph, gravitymeter and plain surface geology, the ceremonial/-ceremonial opening of Has Tanura as an oil porti a nri so on could only havo the effect of whetting the appetite of Ibn Saud Bind his Ministers for ever-increasiiqg royalties* The market for this oil must be in the Eastern Hemisphere and that market was already apportioned among the various Companies* Arabian oil could break in only to a limited extent and it seemed to me that they were deliberately committing themselves to a vast programme of uneconomic production since the prospect of inducing Ibn Saud, after all he has seen on his recent tour, to agree to restricted production must be remote in the extreme. Would it not have been better to develop the Dharan field slowly and to have gone about further exploration leisurely — and silently t I gathered that these views (more or less) are actually held by the Texas people and by soae of the California people also. But there is a strong California group, headed by the President himself, which maintains that there must be rapid development for four reasons i- (a) that the concession calls for it; (b) that the Company are required within a now brief period to select the areas which they wish to retain; (c) that unless they exhibit great activity Ibn Saud may tear up the concession — and they would have no prospect of redress; (d) /'put very amateurly7 each Company* s share in the oil market depends on its potential and not on its actual production. If C.A.S.O.C. can prove by actual test that they have a potential production of say 100000 barrels per day they can then claim possibly an additional 25,000 barrel share in the Eastern Hemi sphere markets. ( N.B . Bahrain obtained a totally dispropor tionate share merely by being included in the total California - Texas share.) All/-All these arguments can be met and the fight between the opposing views goes on, but meanwhile the 'big producers* have their way and soon it wilX be too late to change. might add here that His Majesty's Groverument 1 s decision to allow the Shaikh of Bahrain to grant the Unallotted Area to the Bahrain Petroleum Company arrived only just in time to enable the Company to repel a strong attack on Bahrain pro- duction by C»A.3»0«U» Ibn Saud having seen one tanker loaded at has ianure said he would like to wait and see some more, and this could only have been done at the expense of Bahrain. As things have turned out, 1 am optimistic that Bahrain is fairly safe for 20,000 barrels a day, which is actually mors than the minimum called for in the recent negotiations. How Arabian production (in excess of about 26,000 barrels a day) is to be absorbed I do not know. 11. The Company^ geologists and surveyors have traversed an immense field covering the whole of Hasa, and some of then have bean as far south as the Rabs Khali and others tip to Buralda and Hail. As you know, one of their parties has also been surveying the Saudi-Iraq frontier. There are at least a thousand kilometres of graded track in existence (some of it very much the worse for wear after the King 1 s 350 motor vehicles have pasaed over it). Numerous water wells have been drilled in various parte of the country, some of them producing excellent water which an American or an European can drink without serious damage to his interior. 12. The country is amazingly green. Dharan itself marks more or loss the northern extremity of the Jafurah ( sandy desert with dunes). Northwards is the coastal belt of U as-sudah', a plain with a fairly thin cap of sand, interspersed with sabakhas or soft salty depressions with a thin, comparatively hard crust over marsh. In the north this merges gradually into a gravel plain as one goes westwards, while further south the country rises/--9«. \ rises gradually to a rocky plateau containing 'rodJias' 1 or fertile depressions In which fine grass and shrubs flourish after rain; while west again of both the gravel plains and the rocky plateau is the 'dahana' or sand-dune country, on the far side of which lies Hlyadh. The Company have found that it is not excessively difficult to make tracks across the 'as-sudah' or sandy plain by means of a grader, though such tracks are quickly cut up if narrow motor-car tyres are used. Similarly they find that across most of the sabakhas they can make good tracks by first driving light cars fitted with desert tyres over them, gradually increasing the wAight of the motor vehicles used, and finally using a grader. They are using now four-wheel-drive cars and station waggons and six-wheel-drive lorries (Autocars), all with wide low pressure tyres | and there can be no doubt that if ever military opera tions were undertaken in this area multiple wheel-drive vehicles with broad low-pressure tyres would be essential. ■ » . , *•. * • !

As I have mentioned above I hope to obtain a revised map in a few months 1 time and if I do I will send it along for reproduction. 14« I did not go south to Hofuf, though I hope to do so on a future visit. The King 1 s personal invitation to me to visit Biyadh next winter has been repeated and it might be possible to take advantage of this to make a more leisurely tour of Hasa.

Najib Sffendi then referred us to Mr. Ahmed Lowry, the Local Government Representative at Dammam, regarding suitable sites on which to build at both A1 Khobar and Ras Tanura. These sites were duly chosen but since then, we have heard nothing further as to whether the sites have been duly allotted to us or as to the area of the sites. With regard to the question of Landing Charges which were to have been agreed upon by the Saudi Government and ourselves, we have also heard nothing further in this connection. From the state of affairs existing at Ras T a mra at the time of writing, it would appear that the Government's agreement to our opening up at Al Khobar and Has Tanura has not been communicated to minor officials, ard in particular, to the Customs Officials. The manner of the Minor Custcms Official who stays onboard the ocean vessels discharging at Ras Tanura, is dictatorial , and his instructions, he states, from his supericrs, are that dhows must get cargo first, i.e., should a cargo wnich coulo. oe entirely handled by dhows arrive at Has Tanura and a sutiiciency of dhows arrive alongside, he would insist on these dhows receiving cargo. o /-2- This, 01 course, is contrary to th agreement we have with the sa'jo. i j Ov ernmeiit, tne a^i'eenieQt readirip' t 'Wherever possible, c3hows are to receive 33% of ovm cargo'. ' ' ' As regaras our European Representative visiting Saudi Arabia, it is still necessary to ootain permission for each and every visit in this connection, however, we have recently asked the Local Government Representative at Damman to issue us Passes or visas — to enaole us to visit dauQi Arabia wnen the occasion demands.

S ection 2. Copy No. Mr. Trott to Viscount Halifax.—{Received August 10.) (No. 123.) ' ' My Lord, Jedda, July 23, 1939. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the agreement which was signed at Riyadh on the 31st May last by representatives of the Saudi Arabian Government and of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. The procedure of ratification by both parties will be understood from the terms of articles 15 and 16 of the agreement: the ratification of the Saudi Arabian Government was published in the Mecca paper Umm-al-Qura on the 7th July, 1939; the agreement itself was not published in the local press until the 21st July, which, under article 15, becomes the '' effective date '' on which the agreement enters into force. It is evident that the San Francisco office of the company must have forwarded its ratification, though no formal notice to that effect has yet appeared. 2. The text of the agreement will no doubt be studied by the competent departments of His Majesty's Government, and I propose to confine myself in this despatch to a few comments on some points, which, on a first reading, appear to me worthy of notice. . 3. The references in this agreement to the previous bne signed in 1933 accord perfectly with the text of the latter instrument, which was printed as an enclosure to Foreign Office Print (Confidential) No. 15474 of the 22nd September, 1938.(^ There is, however, no mention of any document dated the 27th May, 1933; the new agreement refers to the original 1933 agreement as ' the Saudi Arab Concession,' and says that it was signed on the 29th May, 1933, the same day as that on which Mr. L. N. Hamilton addressed to the Saudi Minister of Finance his letter con taining four paragraphs and now called the ' Second Principal Agreement.' 4. The areas to which the new agreement, or rather the three agreements taken together, applies are set forth in the terminal schedule. Not only is the previous concessionary area in Eastern Arabia included, but a northern area, a southern area, and the two neutral zones are now allotted to the company for exploitation. I learn from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that His Majesty turned over in his mind for a long time the question of the boundaries of the northern and southern areas : he is unwilling to have any oil prospecting in the centre of the country, and he knows that there is considerable doubt as to where its frontiers really are. The new areas cannot be traced on a map unless the^position of such points as ' the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana,' ' the north-east corner of the boundary line between Yemen and Saudi Arabia,' and of the northern edge of the Great Nefud are first determined. I have not yet been able to fix these places with any accuracy on any map. 5. No mention is made in the new agreement of the contact line between the sedimentary and the igneous formations which probably does not coincide with the eastern edge of the Red Sea Concession. But it is clear from article 12 that whatever preference rights the company possessed under the previous agree ments over areas not yet assigned to them still persist. 6. The company has the right, under section (c) of article 6, to promote a company or companies of a nationality acceptable to the Government to exploit the oil in either of the neutral zones; it also possesses vaiious lights of transport in and access to those zones. . . , , • t • 7 Article 9 gives the company certain rights over the area assigned in 1936 to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in the Red Sea area.

The consideration paid and to be paid for ese extensions of company's area of operations appears very liberal, ,0,000 gold is payable at once; thereafter an annual rental of £20,000 is to be paid; and whenever oil commercial quantities is discovered in the additional areas a further sum of £100,000 gold will be paid. From July 1940 onwards, until oil is discovered in the new areas, 1,300,000 gallons of gasoline and 100,000 gallons of kerosene will^ presented to the Saudi Arabian Government, and after such a discovery is made the amount of gasoline will be increased by 1 million gallons. I have not heard what actual sum in cash has passed; it is clear from the last words of article 4 that the rental due under the 1933 agreements had been overpaid, and I should not be surprised to learn that advances have been made on account of the increased sums which will be payable in future. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and the enclosure to His Majesty 's Ambassador at Bagdad, and to the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. I have, &amp;c. A. C. TROTT. Enclosure. THIS agreement is made between his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Sulaiman- al-Hamdan, Minister of Finance of Saudi Arabia, acting on behalf of the Saudi Arab Government (hereinafter referred to as the ' Government ') of the one part, and William J.

N. Hamilton, on behalf of the Standard Oil Company of California, to and accepted by his Excellency Sheikh Abdulla Sulaiman-al- Hamdan, on behalf of the Government, and bearing the same date as the Saudi Arab Concession.

(2) The relinquishment by the Company of the whole of the additional area. If either of the events mentioned in (1) and (2) above shall occur during the period intervening between any two anniversaries of the effective date of the agreement, the rental payable for the year in which such event occurs shall be only that proportion of the annual rental above mentioned as the number of days that have intervened between the preceding anniversary date and the date of the occurrence of the event mentioned above bears to a full year of 365 days. (c) The sum of £100,000 English, gold, or its equivalent, upon discovery of oil in commercial quantities within the additional areas aforesaid. Each of the foregoing payments shall be made within thirty days from the date upon which it becomes due and shall be made in accordance with and in the manner provided in articles 17 and 18 of the Saudi Arab Concession. The foregoing payments are to be made by the Company in addition to any other payments by way of royalty or advance or otherwise already provided for by the Saudi Arab Concession and yet unpaid, and without prejudice to the right of the Company to recover advances already made under articles 4, 6 and 11 and yet to be made under article 11 of the Saudi Arab Concession, and to recover overpaid rental under article 12 of the Saudi Arab Concession.

California AraMan Standard Oil Company's loans to rbn 3s-ud, 2. San ^Francisco's first reaction to loan proposals was hostile. They considered that Saudi demands are attribu table to the Oomoany*3 acquiescence towards past requests and were disturbed at the prospect of distant liquidation. They put forward a counter proposal to the effect that the Saudi v.-** Government he offered half royalties in advance for 1940, calculated on a daily production of 2^,000 barrels - a figure which in actual fact they do not anticipate reaching, 3. Hamilton (London Office), Skinner (San Zrancisco) and Lenahan (Jedda) who are all here at present telegraphed in reply that they regarded this proposal as tinaoceptable. They considered that c,a ,S,0 ,c 'are facing most critical decision vitally affecting the future' and recommended that Hamilton and Lenahan shoulc^vi^t^an Francisco to '•present all circumstances involved'.

(Hamilton is to go from Jedda to London and possibly to San J'rancisco later). 4. Hamilton has mentioned this matter to me. He stated that it had occurred to him that the major loan proposal might not be altogether welcome to His Majesty's Government if the latter had any idea of subsidizing Ibn Saud themselves. I said I was without information.

(2). Following suggested figures in United States gallons consumption for 1941 are l?omission) official information supplied me by California Company ft and by Shell agents* (a) Jedda. Saudi Arabian Government petrol consumption for 1939 was 1,192,104 and for 1940 1,751,500 gallons. Government have asks d for 3,8 50 ,0 00 gallons f or 1341 (two (?omi ssi on) 550,000 in bulk). Annual consumption is about 60,000 gallons. After private consultation with California Company I consider 3,000,000 gallons would be reasonable though larger- 2 - pilgrimage might raise this figure. California Company estimate Government's paraffin require ments at 340,000 gallons and private consumption on average of 1939 and 1940 will come to 621&gt;000 gallons# California Company estimate that Government will require 330 ( ?omi sai on) gallons diess1 oil while Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate want 530&gt;000 gallons (17 month's supply), I suggest total figure including small private consumption of 1,000,000 gallons. -Eastern Arabia# Riadh is now- supplied with bulk petrol 44,000 gallons from Jedda and with paraffin diesel oil and bulked petrol from Has Tanura. I understand Kuwait only supplies small amount but I have no figures. B&lt;riii a in thus appears to be no longer main source of supply of Government oil requirements. Some kerosene is supplied to Jedda by Shell from Sudan (442,000 Imperial gallons in 1939, 233,000 in 19 40). Socony Vacuum (70,000 gallons in 1939 43,000 in 1940) and Sarland Oil Company of United States of America (80,000 gallons in Karachi for private consumption). Lubricants. In 1939 Shell supplied 80,508 kilogrammes lubricating oil and grease* Other sources (California Company and United States mainly) supplied 208,150 kilogrammes oil and 48,563 of grease. In 1^40 shell supplied 3,900 kilogrammes oil and 59 of grease s 2 93 ,000 of oil end 61,107 grease. - BIRD -CR £« - I V tr o v Ai if* The Political Agent, Baiirain, Persian G-ulf» General Headquarters, Middle East, Cairo- CBMB /11Q45/0S (l)&gt; ^ March.
