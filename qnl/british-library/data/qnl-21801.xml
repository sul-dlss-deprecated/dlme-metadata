Empire Day, May 24th, falling at a moment of crisis n the British Empire’s history, was a mark even more moving than usual f the invisible bonds which unite the imperial community. The voice of he King, speaking from London, constituted the tangible link between .is peoples, and .from all parts of the earth came news of unity and etermination to prevent 'the spread of the blot of barbarism over the hole map of the world.' iritain’s Para shots. The new Parashot Army is one of the most visible lings of the quickened war effort in Great Britain. Patrols formed ‘rom the first 400,000 men who responded to the w?r Office appeal are Iready out on the roads and over the countryside. They are now being *e-aaforced by mobile columns of well-trained, splendidly equipped ,roops. These they can at a momenta notice summon to their aid. To he mobile columns, the Pafashot Army will bear a relation which jfcomises to be as firm as that between the old Regular and Territorial armies. II. BEHIND THE GERMAN LINES. 3QU-ANDERED LIVES, /'ll reports from the western front confirm the view hat Nazi plans have been laid without thought for expenditure of life. *itler seems to have reckoned that, with eighty millions at his disposal, xe can well afford to fling away one million lives, or two, or three. The policy is fully in keeping with his past utterances: t / 'We must be prepared for the hardest struggle that a nation has ever had to face. Only through this test of endurance can we become ripe for the dominion to which we are called. It will be my duty to carry on this war regardless of losses.' *, (Address to party leaders quoted by Dr.Hermann Rauschning, Hitler speaks, p.281). ?HalfVA*Million Casualties in less than three weeks.' The haste and indignation with which the Nazi press and wireless denied the Franco* American estimate suggestd.that news from foreign sources is still filtering into Germany, arid that the German High Command is highly sensitive on the score of the losses it has occurred. •' CONCEALMENT OF LG3S is contrived by sending all wounded to hospitals remote from their home area. The schools and institutions of Austria Styria are reliably reported to be full of North German ' casualties. FUEL FOR ATTACK. 'One wonders how long the Germans can stand this reckless pace: how long Hitler's war machine can continue to burn gasoline at a rate variously estimated at between 750,000 and 1,500,000 gallons a day.' (New York Times, May 23th e ) With his booty offset by±e lengthening of his lines of communicrtion, Hitler's rrce with his jupplies of fuel oil remrins rs desperrte os ever, Indicction of his :nxiety comes from the occupied a.rers of Norway, Hollmd rnd Denmark, mich have this week been instructed by wireless (May 25th) to change 'heir oil driven machinery (including electric power plants) over to 5 team, and to burn rubbish as fuel, '’People who do not comply with this )rder will be punished.” Hitler speaks' HJMOUR. Nov/ that the world is deprived of former unbiassed clearing iouses of European news such as Copenhagen and Amsterdam, Germany is :ble to exploit to the full her rumour technique as a weapon of attack, ler most plausible device is to tip news items to complaisant or even jO unsuspecting neutral papers, ana then to re-issue she news dressed ip as truth ”from a neutral source.” Thus the rumour launched on lay 26th by a German Official^Nei/^Agency(DcN.B)correspondent in the fnited States that something is going to happen to the American Liner Resident Roosevelt, had, on the German wireless of the 27th, already acome a ’’Boston report. ” For the sake of the men, women and children on board, we can &gt;nly hope that the Nazis will leave it at rumour. &gt; ropaganda Themes continue tq include Dr.Goebelles well-worn boats that iomber beat battleship. Claims that German bombers have sunk countless Sritish men-of-war are being disseminated by leaflet to France and by Fireless to the news-starved peoples of the occupied territories. ; ctually, no British vessel larger than a destroyer has yet been sunk rom the air. The casualties to date are: 5 destroyers, 1 sloop, . minesv/eeper and 15 trawlers. Of these last, 4 were merely damaged, nd were sunk by the British themselves as being unfitted for the forth Sea crossing back from Norway. As the Italian Admiral Cavagnari .dmitted in his recent report to the Senate: ”It is very difficult -o hit from the air ships manoeuvring at speed.” III. POSTSCRIPT. NEUTRAL SPEAKS. ’’Every one of our drivers agrees that the Red Cross mly attracts the attention of the German pilots. For the last ten days lurcars have been bombed and machine-gunned, sometimes by planes ’lying as low as 50 feet from the ground. The Red Cross does not &gt;rotect our men; we are taking it off for their protection.” The speaker is a director of the American Field Ambulance lervice; the time and place, Paris, May 26th, 1940. o'&lt;,seK\V goport of public opinion in Bahrain # ihe news of the fall of Paris, which spread like wild fire yesterday afternoon, though expected, was thought to be so important that it appeared to many as an unbelievable miracle* It was however received with pleasure* Italy’s entry into the feelings, and Italy’s past atrocities are discussed whenever her name is mentioned* ihe Italians are looked up son with contempt, and Italy is thought to be one of the most cowardly nations, especially because of their inability to conquer Abyssinia, with their modern war weapons, except after having to resort to the extensive use of mustard gas against a weak nation most of whose forces are equipped with primitive weapons* In spite of the general belief that Germany will win this war it is thought, and hoped, that Italy with her exposed coasts and colonies, will soon go down before that is achieved* There are certain apprehensions about Italian attacks on Arab countries, especially %ypt* war did not cause any surprise* There are strong anti-Italian /S. 6.

Detect, the 20th June 1940 0 TALKING POINTB Ps a result of the disloeet Points have come this week from the Min ion of Mcils, no Talking istry of Information. 2. The following points may however be of use* (1)German casualties up to the early days of June were enormous. No idea can be formed of the casualties of their infantry. But out of an estimated total of 5,000 available tanks, 2,000 were completely destroyed, and 2,000 more are believed^to have been put for the time out of'action, German fir Losses, In aircraft the Germans had lost between September 1 of last year and May 18, 2,237 machines of all types. Since the invasion of the Low Countries began 1,060 ‘planes, 957 of the latest type, huve been lost: r nd the present figure of tot r l losses must now approach 3,000, Between May 10 and 17, 1,522 pilots are given as killed, wounded or missing; but it is non certain if the Germans have been using all their best airmen. (2)Parachute technique. Official&amp;their uniform is the German AirForce blue-grey but the men may be disguised - not infrequently in the uniform of the country attacked. P steel helmet like a motorist f s crash-helmet, respirator, hand grenades a gun firing 600 rounds a minute,, and'perhaps a collapsable bicycle, are their essential equipment. Company equipment, dropped in special containers with self-opening parachutes 'fter the men hwd landed, includes ammunition and rifles, field glasses, compasses, spades, smoke candles and wire. The battalion auxiliary weapons are the 3-inch mountain gun, medium and light mortars, heavy and light machine guns and machine gun pistols. Parachute attack is preceded if possible by air reconnaissance. When the parachutists descent 150 feet from their slow-moving ‘planes, it is supposed to be possible for a company to land within an area of about 220 yards by 440, and assemble within a quarter of an hour. Their functions are to seize aerodromes, power stations, railway junctions and telephone exchanges, and^either nrke these useless or hold them until reinforcements arrive, possibly in answer to their signals. To these activities are added the creation of panic and spreading false news. The German military Junkbis 39 and the civil Junkers 90 can carry 40 fully equipped’men ft a cruising speed of 200 miles an hour. It was the lending of thousands of men in troop-carrying yplanes, and not the parachutists, that became a decisive f actor m Holland. But it, rema ms to be seen whether these unweildy machines can penetrate the highly ' organised British anti-aircraft defences in anything like effective numbers. Fven then, such large scale raids would not constitute a real invsrion of England. This point is for the information of talkers only; it is only to be used in case of parachute attacks on England and in answer to any awkward quries why we cannot pick off parachutists one by one as they slowly drop to earth. The portion side lined is most important.^ The 50,000 ~ 80,000 vv T hite Itc lim troops in /byssinic ere now entirely dependent on locfl resources. Moreover, Brito in is assisting the exiled tribrl chieftrins to return md regf in their Imds rnd their freedom, so, if the Itrlirn troops rre not stsrved out, they will most likely be rnnihilrted by the tribes they thought they hrd conquored. (4l Britrin will still fight on, despite whrtever happens in France. Stress fl) Our mastery of the sers. (2) The superiority of the quality of our pilots and r.eroplrnes and that with the aid of the U.S./. we will soon attain numerical superiority. (3) Vast new armies are being trained. 3. Of these, (4) is far the most important, in order to keep up local morale. Yours sincerely, Sd. R.D.Metcalfe.iig-^Xy...X^QIl^-^£^ u ]3.1 i .c.,,.o p .inion_in ,.^ahi:,a r in&gt; rhe general opinion is that France has completely collapsed and that she will have to accept the German terms however harsh and unjust they may be. ihe public appear to be most eager to know what these terms are since they are ejected to affect byria and other Arab countries in French possession. it is expected that Germany*s next move will be to invade the British isles by sea and air or might attempt to blockade them while making constant air attacks and using big guns like **^ig bertha” from the French and Belgian coasts. It is thought that though the odds are too strong against Britain she might be able to withstand them for a long time. 'Lj &lt;vTelegram From To No, Dated 'Q'. Political Agent, Bahrain.

Most people agree with Mr. Churchill’s remarks about the value of hitler's promises regarding the French navy and that he nil not hesitate to break his promise by using ii, once it has become under his control* France as very severe; indeed they expect that the peace terms will still be more severe. But they do not think that the war has ended as they feel sure that Britain will not ley arms until she achieves her object,i.e., the defeet of Nazi Germany, The people ere very anxious about the fate of the French fleet end say that i4 it fells into German hands, it will be of considerable help to them.

It is true that Britain is now a strongly defended fortress but that is only a natural precaution against the possibility of an attempted invasion. We do npt at all intend to sit snug behind our defences a.nd do nothing and this may be illustrated by our continual day and night air action over enemy ^nd enemy occupied territory and by the landing of reconnoitring land forces on the French coast.

They add that having seen this uniform on prisoners of war, they are not surprised. 1 3. f # The German propaganda machine hr s of late been publishing reports that we are making overtures for peace. In particular, it was alleged that Mr.Chamberla in was leading a revolt of the Conservative Party against the Prime Minister and that peace negotiations were being conducted by Sir Samuel Hoare, our Ambassador in Madrid, through the Spanish Government. The German objective was to convince American ppinion of the futility of giving us further help and so cause it to swing back in favour of complete isolation, thus ensuring that Mr.Wendell Wilkie, who has strong pro-British and non-isolationist feelings, would not be successful in the recent elections. The Germans have, of course, failed in their design but it shows that they view the problem of attacking the British Empire, re-inforced by powerful aid from America, with distinct apprehension. It is also possible that peace rumours, divorced from their context and therefore the more insidious, may trickle out here; if so, they must be scotched immediately. 4. P Swedish correspondent, who was in Berlin when Paris fell, says that neither this news nor the announcement of French surrender aroused any enthusiasm. This remarkable lack of reaction is attributed to extreme fatigue fpllowing a ,very difficult winter; the fight for dailyvke-fd dominates the ^ people's minds more than war news. Also the never ending Red Cross trains and obituary notices in the papers dampened rejoicing.

Dear Copy for P.A.Bahrain. TALKING POINTS. Office of the Publicity Officer Persian kilf, Care of: Political Agency* Bahr*ain 0 Dated, 9th Julv 1940. In continuation of our campaign to emphasise that Britain is a base for aggressive action against the enemy, the latest news provides many illustrations of effective action. Strong minefields have been laid along the Northern Coasts of Europe and the coa.st of Scandinavia, the Submarine Snapper torpedoed 5 transports in one day and we have averaged over two German planes a day since June loth. Incidentally, it is now officially estimated that we alone have destroyed 5,500 German planes since the outbreak of war, This figure has even greater significance in the loss of trained personnel it represents and who cannot be replaced by mass production and does not include aeroplanes known to have been destroyed by any of our allies. Nor does it include any planes known to haveoeen damaged. (D against us. ( 2 ) Further examples of aggressive action are: Our action to erasure that the French fleet is not used and very effective, recently trken on Aggressive action by the F./.F.is daily continuous / party of American journalists were, v, 140u mile tour of the Ruhr and the Rhineland as a part of German pr ope Uganda. Rut the Germans were unable to disguise that our nightly raids caused considerable damage and many casualties. Indeed, the Americans clearly observed that our bombs had hit many military objectives -nd that industry was showing distinct signs of disruption. The local population, especially factory workers, were also very fatigued. (3) As a result of our blockade, spinning and weaving looms in Germany are only working 24 hours a- week and &lt; the textile industry 3 days put of six. (4) Aggressive action is not confined to Europe. There, have been eight direct hits by bombs on Italian battleships m Tobruk in one day, as a result of which two large ships went aground t one was down by the stern, pne listing heavily and one cruiser and another vessel were in difficulties. Two Italian submarines were sunk in one day by one aeroplane in the Mediterranean and 60 A,A.guns and 4,000,000 rounds of ammunition have been captured in Libya. 2. A point that may come in useful is the explanation why our ra.ids are always so successful whereas German bombs are apparently dropped haphazard. The reason is not so much lack of skill(though the Germans must be feeling a shortage of trained pilots)as the difficulty of flying over Engl-nd. England is well known as a nightmare to navigators. Roads twist and turn, are narrow and obscured byhedges and railways have not been able to move themselves in accordance with the marked displacement of industry during recent years. Our weather is, of course, v/ell known. There are thus no guides to the navigator, whereas the German autobahnen and straight railways offer excellent indications to our pilots. Further, our scenery is always on.a miniature scale and changes with amazing rapidity, thus making camouflage very effective. There, is therefore every reason to believe the official accounts of our successes and of the German lack of success. 3. The imminence of invasion is a burning topic now-a- days and the following resume of a talk on the B.B.C.by am) C\ - 2 - senior strff officer mry be useful.

Germeny will require therefore cL leesten equal foaSce of armed men. It tekes 20 large ships to transport 15,000 men and though Germany has suffidient vessels, the undertaking is tremendous. It must therefore be carried out Ruthlessly, as one big venture. (6) Pn invasion will doubtless, in accordance with modern German practice, be preceded or accompanied by heavy bombing. Troops and parachutists will also be landed by air to create confusion, ^t the same time, her transports will require all the protection her fighter aircraft and scanty fleet can give. Tanks etcetrr .can be landed, but obly in small quantities, from special landing craft and Germany must for this reason first capture one port as a base. , We may therefore expect strong raids against different ports, followed or accompanied by action irom the whole of her air and sea forces. Though she may make Ireland a helf-w r ay house. (7) Unlike Norway this time she will have no advantages^from surprise and 5th Column activities. (o) Communications will be a tremendous problem. For ourselves, we have the following advantages. (1) Pn army or 1% million, supported by an equal number of yolunteer corps. Nearly all the latter , G xperience of 1914-18 and large numbers of the former fought recently in Flanders. The theory of German invincibility is to them a complete roytn and they are all keen-to take the offensive. We thus have the advantage in morale. (2) The strength of our Navy need not be stressd and our Pit lorce numerically is stronger now then when Germany invaded Belgium on May 15th; its individual, superiority is of course unquestioned. (•3) We will be fighting in our own country. Communications rre good but tricky and with no P.P.. signs, Germans would be lost in our mass of lanes. (4) The Germans would be hostile strangers in t hostile land. # 7 Ps an instance of our defences, there are n®w barbed wire entanglements and block houses in the streets of London.

(£m 'new Fighter - the Boulton Paul Defiant - proved a great success on the Western Front, one squadron shooting down fifty enemy aircraft in three days* It is designed to be complimentary to the Spitfires and Hurricanes and its principal distinction from these machines is its mechanically operated gun turret, like our bombers? The Hurricanes and Spitfires have 8 machine guns worked by the pilots Their fire is devastating but since they are in rigid positions along the wings, the pilot has to fly in the direction of his target. In the Defiant the pilot is accompanied by a gunner, who operates the gun turret in the rear of the fuselage* The four machine guns in the turret fire simultaneously but since they are moveable the gunner can choose his aim independently, of the direction of flight. The Defiant has Rolls-Royce Merlin engines; its speed is still secret* 3.

Dear You will probably be finding b::' row that you are on an easy wicket when discussing aerial matters; so I am not giving you more than the following figures:- ♦ (i) Week ending September 06th:- 112 raids on military objectives. We lost 9 bombers, and got at least 3 fighters, (ii) 90% of Germany 1 s synthetic oil production, and Q0% of her refineries have now been bombed. Emphasize that 40$ of these are in Western Germany, and a further 50$ in Central Germany. 2 . (i) yesterday's failure of six successive German raids to get over London at all, although the loss figures were not large, is really the best advertisement our defence has yet had. Explain to your^contacts” the rough system of our A.A.barrage, ^uns firing on fixed heights, some to burst at 20,000 feet, some at 19,000, some at 18.000 etc., putting up a 'curtain of fire' between the raiders and their targers. planes can thtiis be brought down even if not spotted; and the absence of searchlights increases the effectiveness of the cables of the barrage balloons. (ii) As a contrast, mention an angry article which recently appeared in ”DER 8CHWABZL KQRPb 7 ', the organ of the Black Guard, protesting against the wave of jokes at the expense of the German anti-aircraft defence, which have flooded the country since the R.A.F.began its large scale raids. These have taken the place of the pre-war political iaressees jokes/-2 jokes^ or jokes about ersatz material. The n Schwarze Korps M # in the best heavy Teutonic manner, begins by saying that no defence of their anti-aircraft fire is necessary] but this does not prevent it from devoting two columns to expatiating on the virtues of the guns and their crews, which are understood by soldiers, as distinct from ignorant and ill-conditioned civilians. 3. You should not have great difficulty in discount** in 0 the Axis/Japanese pact, a union of economic bankrupts* each hoping to divert to the other side the attention of the United States of America. It would be unwise to make any forecast of the course of Russian policy, founded as it is on the merest opportunism; but the statement of‘ the Japanese Foreign Minister that T, this does not effect the ant i-Comitern pact” is worth dropping out as a stimulant to teas- thought on the part of your subject. Other insinuations can be based on the move of the Canadian/U.S.A. defence board to strength- en the pacific defences; or the expiry of the agreement to close the Burma road on October 17th. 4 . Better to keep off the matter of Indo-China; but if the subject is opened with you, point out that even if the Japanese get control of the Hanoi-Yunnan railway, five of the best Chinese divisions have been waiting for them far the last month, in terrain extremely favourable to the defence. 5 . It is too early to be safe in inferring that Senor Suner T s visit to Berlin was a disappointment to the Nazis, although the frigid statement issued in Berlin at its conclusion contrasts with the usual Nazi ”biurb'. A good point/point to put your finder on is the An^lo-Spanish to restrict Spain’s oil quota* signed while Senor Sun^r v^as away. You can safely state as your opinion that Spain will willingly only fight in self-defence. 6* If you want to hint at rifts within the Axi* lute* a pleasant story is the burglary of the German Eabasay at Istanbul* in which a number of documents vanished. It has now been almost certainly established that this was done by Italians. 7. Wo talker has replied to the last paragraph of my letter dated 21st September. I hope they will do so$ Yours sincerely.

Dear I have been told by one talker that it is the statistics that are most successful. The present letter will therefore be largely devoted to these; but I should warn talkers resident in Bahrain that some of them have formed the basis of articles in the Bahrain Arabic newspaper this week, and the method of opening conversations may be adjusted accordingly. 2 .

Hammer in that our raids are carried out on a s systematic plan, aimed at the heart of Germany’s economic system. We cannot blast the whole of her industry, so we concentrate on industrial 'bottle-necks”, where hold ups of production will automatically restrict the flow in other industries, one example would be nitric and sulphuric acid plants. Or we blow* up aluminium works (although Germany has plenty of bauxite, from which aluminium is derived), in order to check in its early stages Germany’s attempt to find in aluminium a substitute for the coxjper in which she is so sadly deficient. 4./- idressees4 . o Industries can also be brought to a standstill by w indirect ,? bombing, i.e., by paralysing th.e-...maffns-'-oil distribution. Note figures above under ^railways' and ^public utilities , ^ 5* Point out to your subjects that this scientific warfare(as contrasted with indiscriminate Luftwaffe methods) reveals the existence of a superb secret service system. Hint at the existence of our own 'fifth column' in Germany, and particularly in German occupied territory’. 6. (i)The Manchester Guardian has some good figures on Germany^ oil position:- The total reserve, including seized a ^ in occupied countries. 18 million tons. Annual domestic production of Germany 3 million tons. Total annual output of Roumania (assuming none left to Italy, and transport difficulties solved) ... 4 million tons. Total 25 million tons. (For one year only) Assets for the second year will obviously be only the second and third items (the latter perhaps slightly increased), i.e., about 8 million tons. (ii)Against these figures set the consumption of industries and transport in Germany and occupied territories, plus the minimum requirements of the German army, which are computed at 24 and 6 million tons respectively. Commercial consuption may be slightly limited; but emphasize that these industries are the basis on which a modern army must rest, and cannot be starved. (iii)So Germany’s deficit is 5 million tons in the next twelve months, if she throws in all her reserves; and then an annual deficit of 22 million tons. 7, These figures, however, recyuire to be modified still more in our favour by the disclosures in the latest speech of •o Mr.Hugh Dalton. Pointing out that nearly half of i?er rn ^ny 1 g synthetic oil industries and refineries are in Western Germany^ he stated that the R.A.F.have now bombed 90% of the former and 80% of the latter; and that these targets have been T? heavily hit.” 8. Commenting on his speech, the Daily Telegraph reckons that nearly all the oil seizef in occupied territories has now been used up in the aerial blitzkrieg or blown up by us. 'This seems a trifle optimistic, but is worth a mention in any conversation on the subject. 9. Lastly, some figures about Germany*s losses in personnel since the collapse of France. (i) Sir Archibald Sinclair’s speech on Sept.,21st gave four thousand trained air personnel lost over Great Britain since August 5th, against 600 British lost over Great Britain and Germany. He gave this 4,000 as the minimum figure. I see that Reuter ! s later gave 7,000, but I do not advise basing conversations on this figure, as it seems too large, even for about 2,000 planes (which includes single-seaters). (iiJ Dutch and Belgian sources for the New York Herald Tribune gave the losses of the German army in barge concentrations, railway junctions etc., on the Channel coast as 60 thousand. Independently, a British newspaper correspond ent on the Franco-Spanish frontier gave the figure as 50 to 60 thousand. That seems good enough to talk about!

Dear 1; (i)_0ne member of the organization has told me that the Italian advance to Sidi Barrani has been a difficult subject. Admittedly ? after dunquarque and Berbers, it is not easy to talk about strategic withdrawals,. But it should not” be unduly difficult to avoid being forced into the position of trying to argue that we sxhould take the offensive by land in this area, il you put it to ycur ?? contact H that in this area the Army must be the defensi/e arm of the whole services &lt; 1. e., must keep a hostile army off the (JanaI: while the offensive is done by the havy(Blockade) and the counter-offensive by the K.A.F,(attacks on the hostile concentrations). One need not,of course,be alarmed at any of the following possibilities, but until we see whether the Axis axe going to make for Palestine via Turkey and Syria, or Gibraltar via Spain, we should be foolish to commit ourselves to a land offensive. There is even a possibility qf the Italians seeking to avoid the coast route, and making instead for Upper Egypt, via the western oases. ( 11 ) The' member who put in this report said that he had stressed the geographical and communications! difficulties of the Italians; and this point requires no comment. (iii) Things should be easier on this subject since Graziani’s ' ; bleat H to Mussolini that he is now confronted with an army of a quarter of a million. 2, For a counter-attack, I recommend the'Tfeliannair losses in Africa for September, 57 certain plus 44 probable; bringing their total losses for the war to 214 certain plus 124 probable. It would probably be correct to say that three hundred planes mean more to Italy than the German loss of three thousand means to them. 2. Paragraph 9 (i) of my last letter. A Ministry of Information telegram now^ gives “at least 6000' as the German loss in trained air personnel since the collapse of France. 4. Paragraph 6 of my last letter. It may have caused surprise that I Sid' not give figures for Russia: but her annual surplus to her own commercial and military consumption is authoritatively stated as only a little over ha If a million tons, sc it is hardly worth taking into account. 5.

Dear Bahrain has recently provided its own 'talking point' but here is some i 'aminunition n for when that is exhausted. a previous report, and says 'statistics are useless; give us stories.' material has to be truthful; but here are two (a) Graziani has acquired in Libya the reputation for having the evil eye, and Italian Sicilia and .Arab troops may now be seen furtively extending three (3) fingers towards him when he passes. Apparently this started at Benghazi when he stopped to pat a small Arab boy on the head, and the boy fell down in a fit. (b) A source usually found reliable states that a German who baled out over England, landed carrying his dressing case and a fur coat. Comment is superfluous. 3. The sending of 5,000 Italian pilots, with machines and groundstaff, to Germany may be read in conjunction with the increasing 'ersatz-ness' of the German planes being shot down over England. This point, however, should be only moderately stressed, as we are by no means through with the Luftwaffe yet. 4. The loss ratio is definitely dov/n lately. The reason is that German bombers, expensive to replace and easy to shoot down, have been replaced by fighters carrying bombs, heavily 2. One member of the organization has quite contradicted I cannot exactly turn them out to demand, as this ual Addressees.escorted by unlcden fighters. In severrl forinrtions of more then a hundred mrchines, not more then ten carried bombs. Stress, therefore, the damage ratio rather than the loss ratio. Last week’s raids by the B.A.F., in spite of difficult weather conditions, totalled 141. At the Magdeburg synthetic oil plant one salvo of bombs caused eighteen explosions. Contrast this with results obtained here J It is not officially announced, but it is stated in an article in the New York World Telegram that 'dozens of deadly gadgets recently considered military secrets have been released to our ally'. It is reasonable to express confident expectation that this includes the bomb sight. Certainly we are about to get the Air Cobra, which travels at 400 m.p.h., and carries one cannon and four machine guns.

The chief subject of interest last week is the air raid on Bahrain. At first most people thought that it was staged by the British with the object of inciting America against the axis powers, creating complications between them and Saudi Arabia and winning Arab sympathies. This belief became almost a certainty when no annoucements were made about the matter by enemy broadcasts that evening. But on the following evening when it was announced by Berlin and Rome people laughed heartily at all those exaggarated claims which gave them a sample of false enemy claims which hitherto they used to believe. It has increased the Arab belief of the cowardice of the Italians whose aif men mere thought to be in such terror themselves t that they were unable to aim properly at their target though they met with no opposition.

Dear Rushbrook Willianis, India Office, Whitehall,S.W.l. \ 17th September,1940. * v * Would you please refer to your letter of the 6th September, No.RP 2011/91, regarding the presentation of comments from the Persian Gulf on the B.B.C.Arabic broadcasts. When the Arabic broadcasts started early in 1938 we arranged that all communications from the Persian Gulf relating to them should be addressed to us and passed on by us vin the absence of any objection to their contents) to the B.B.C. The latter, how ever, v/ished, for the sake of promoting personal contact, to address communications to the political officers direct, and we raised no objection provided the letters passed through us under open cover. This arrangement is still working. I think it has been departed from only in one or tY/o cases in which a political officer has Y/ritten direct iand in unobjectionable terms) to the B.B.C. sending a copy of his letter to us. m accordance with the arrangement we have regularly passed on to the B.B.C.^and more recently also to your Ministry) copies of the reports of listeners 1 Committees and similar material, in effect, therefore we have been in a position to exercise control, if necessa-o, b^r being the channel for communications between the Gulf authorities and the B.B.C. This applied also in the past to nev/s items suggested by political officers for inclusion in the Arabic news bulletin, which were telegraphed to us and not direct to the B.B2C. When the Publicity Officer was appointed a few months ago we felt it was unnecessary for us to play in his case the same part of intermediary, and we accordingly agreed vas did the political Resident) that he should correspond direct with the Ministry of Information on all routine matters. We subsequently also agreed, on the proposal of the B.B.C., to direct communication between him and them on publicity matters, i note that he nov/ sends direct to the B.B.C. as v/ell as to you and to us a copy of the reports of the Bahrain listeners 1 Committee, and doubtless he als telegraphs news items direct to the B.B.C. You will see, therefore, that we act as intermediary in communications between Political of ficers and the B.B.vj* . it would be quite a simple matter for us to send copies of theii reports, etc., to you only, and not also to the B.B.C. it would however he perhaps rather embarrassing for us to break off the direct contact between the B.B.C. and the publicity ofixcer, an I should be glad to learn v/hether you think it. desirable to do so. I need hardly add that we welcome your proposal that you and Sir Kinahan Cornwallis should work up a case, based on any complaints from the Gulf, and put it to the Middle hast Committee of the B.B.C.

The pre-war position as betY/een jeolitical and Publicity Officers and the B.B.C. has been, i think, somev/hat altered by the creation of the Ministry of information, v/hich is now able to co-ordinate over a wide area comment and criticism on the subject of B.B.G.broadcasts.

Direct correspondence between Political and Publicity Officers on the one hand, and the B.B.C. on the other, has accordingly led to friction; and it would certainly assist this Ministry if such correspondence were in the first instance addressed by Political and Publicity Officers to their own Department - in your case the India Office - and subsequently passed to the Ministry for such action as might seem necessary. The despatch of news telegrams to the B.B.C. by Publicity Officers has also been affected by war time conditions: for such telegrams have now to be referred to the Ministry for censorship: and it saves time if they are sent here direct • el Bsq., India Office. xours sincerely, sd.

Dear I am putting this out in order to reach most members before the ’Id, when you may have a certain amount of talking to do, although I nave unfortunately not yet got any notable points on the Itelo-Greek position. 2 . (i) What you could perhaps put over would be the Greeks’ record in the last war:- 200,000 men under arms, who beat the Bulgarians in the opening battles, and played an important part in the September 1918 advance. (ii) There have already been indications of the Italian army being hampered by sabotage in South Alb^nic. (iii) The Fascist Government have recently had to send touring propagandists round a large number of Italian towns to explain the causes for Italy entering the war,and generally pacify public opinion. 3 . (i) According x - thxxoed Press reports from Bucharest, three Rumanian oilfields were burnt out near a place called Baicoi a fortnight ago. Sabotage may be inferred. (ii) The Istanbul correspondent of the New York Times says that Genp^ ^rgclll^n, one Head of the German Intelligence S ervice, has informed Iron Guard Rumanians that their country is to be a base for further advance against the Soviet; but that at the moment they must avoid giving Russia cause for offence. (iii) The Russians ere, however, r.pprrently not entirely blind to the danger, os they rre reported to heve occupied Chile, ,nd on the northern end centre! mouths of/- I Aaoressees.- 2 - of the De.nube respectively; end mry perhaps move on the Gheorghe (or southern) channel before long, 4* (i) Now for the rir again:- In case you hear it argued that the Luftwaffe are now giving us good as they get over Great Britain - their confirmed losses for week ending October 26th were 39 planes. We lost 18, of which 9,pilots are safe. (ii) In the same period, Berlin was raided on 4 nights, making 23 the total to date. Railway yards, electricity works and power stations were hit. The Fiat works at TURIN, and the Marelli electrical works at San Giovanni were raided in the same period. (iii) For raconteurs:- a Joke now current in Berlin concerns a condemned prisoner, who, vdien asked how he would like to be put to death, asked to be shot by an anti-aircraft gunner. 5. The Canadian Air Minister has announced that the Canadian Defence Department is engaged on plans for the training- of parachute troops ready for our offensive. 6. (i) As regards economics:- Moscow radio announced the other night that the Germans are using cement casings for bombs over Britain, owing to shortage of metal. This is unconfirmed; and in my opinion, more useful rs an indication of wishful thinking in Russia. (ii) The Air Ministry, however, quote 'well-informed foreign industrialists' for the statement that about 20% of Germany f s total productive capacity has already been affected by R.A.F.Raids. (iii) Ae regards our own economic position:- (a) Exports to countries other than Europe and the Mediterranean for the six months ending August 31st, 1940 were twenty pe r cent higher than the corresponding period of 19o9. (b)/-\ - 3 - (b) The increase rate appears to be rising, judging by these figures of total exports for:- September 1939 £.23,000,000 September 1940 £.31,100,000 7.

It is well known that Italy has since some time been trying to find an excuse to launch such an attack which is thought to be unjustified. Public sympathies are with Greece just because Italy is her attacker rather than any genuine feelings of sympathy. It is thought that unless immediate and active help is rendered to Greece by Turkey and Great Britain she may not be able to stand for more than a few weeks, and then Turkey will be the next victim of attack not only by the Italians through Greece but also by the Germans through Bulgaria which is thought to be in league with the axis powers and may herself join in the attack, then, it is thought, the fate of the east will be sealed. /%i h’GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department. ry B'—This is m ORIGINAL MESSAGE, sent by post to save telegraphic expense and undue use of the wires, but intended to be treated, on receipt, with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed, lo save time and formalities it is worded and signed as if it had been so despatched^ Confidential From The Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Political Resident, Camp, Bahrain.

Hitler 1 s speech last v/eek did not create any interest. It was thought to be dull and composed of the threatening parts of his previous speeches. The colour with which enemy broadcasts are trying to paint the death of the Egyptian Prime Minister did not hold water with the public because Sabri Pasha is known to be pro-3ritish and the British have no cause to 'kill him' as enemy broadcasts want people to believe.

I'Ll © The recent political activities of the axis, and specially their success in inducing Hungary to join the tri-partite pact, are supposed to be political victories aimed at isolating Great Britain from European politics and at keeping America out of the war. It is realized that Mussolini has placed himself in a precaiirious position by his Greek adventure and, it is thought, that Hitler, as is indicated by his conference with the King of Bulgaria, intends to go to extricate him. People are beginning to express admiration for Great Britain's endurance and strong resistance.

We have still 585 million dollars in cash in American banks, against 315 millions spent. This is in addition to our gold reserves in the United States of America, which we increased by 4,000 million dollars in the past year. A loan of 2500 million dollars to us has been proposed by the Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Bank. These facts should dispel any idea that our credit there is running low. (ii) l Reference Mr .Arthur Greenwood T s s tatemont on , the merchant shinning losses^ At their maximum, the weekly losses have boon only half of those of 1917, with which he drew a rather unfortunate comparison. Moreover, the cargoes now being carried are all for ourselves. In 1917, we were supplying our Allies, e.g. petrol for Franco and Italy. Point out that there is no unsolved technical problem about modern anti-submarine warfare; it is moroly a matter of sufficiency of escort vessels: also that it is France's dofection(i.e. the loss of the Atlantic seaboard) that has caused the increase, and not any failure of the Admiralty. Keep the Lorient raids before your hearers* eyes.1 (iii) Italy. (a) When discussing Albania, always romonbor that if the Gorman army (which has now got 80 divisions in Koumania) intervenes, Greece must fall. Wo are strict ly enjoined to avoid premature exultation for this reason. Emphasize on the other hand the effect which such inter vention would have on Turkey; the stiffening of Bulgarian (especially since Mr.Butler’s promises to respect her claims on the Dobruja at the peace conference) and Yugo slavian attitudes; and the fact that Germany would almost certainly demand concessions from Italy in the Trentino and in the Adriatic in return for her help. Such demands might end the Axis. The Roumanian assassinations also indicate very good reasons for Gorman unwillingness to increase their Balkan commitments at tho moment. (b) It is too early yet to put out any points on tho Libyan operations; but ono might arguo that Wavoll, who was strongminded enough to remain passive at the time of the advance to Sidi Barrani, would not now be taking tho / offensive without good reasons for optimisum* Prisoners list was over 1000 by December 10th(3 days’ fighting). (c) You will naturally be talking about tho Badoglio resignation. Remembor that ho took on tho Abyssinian cam paign when De Bono had como to a stop; so ho is obviously not a man to run away from a 'tough job' if ho can see a way to finish it. Put this in with tho resignation of Admiral Ccivavniari and of De Vocchi, Governor of tho Dode- &gt; j 1 1 ii i \ ; i % • anese, tho latter having advised Mussolini that tho Dode- anoso could not be hold. iv) Tho Navy again. Tho Carnarvon castle was paVT^y repaired ith steel plates taken off the Graf Spec. Every singJo local irm offered their help; whereas not one offered services o Graf Spee. b) For my racont rp . A merchant seaman chatting to a friend in tho bar. . m'I suppose you had a pretty tough time in tho channel”.

On the basis of reports received on the recent trial broadcasts it was proposed to the Meeting that the time of the Bahrain broadcast should be moved forward one hour, i.e. to 1500 C.M.T., in order to av&amp;id 'skip'. The Committee agreed to this and said that it was a very suitable time being approximately one hour after sun-set at the present season. 2. It was explained to the Committee that owing to the break-down of the Bahrain Bushire cable Messrs. Cable and Wireless Ltd., were getting a great deal of extra wireless traffic to clear. It was not, therefore, possible to expand the programme. The Committee agreed that a broadcast of approximate ly 40 minutes was long enough. 3. The Publicity Officer explained the difficulties he had experienced in trying to collect talks on subjects other than those connected with the War or politics in general. A brief advertise ment for local talent, to be broadcast and reprinted in the newspaper Al-Bahrain was shown to the Commi ttee and approved. 4. The Publicity Officer explained that owing to the attitude of the Shaikh of Bahrain towards playing of string instruments in his territory it was not possible to put on programmes of local music. The Adviser to the Bahrain Covernmenthas, however, offered to allow the Bahrain Police Band to play at our Studio. The Coinmittee express ed strong approval of this and asked for the fefcnd to play twice a week. It was, however, thought advisable to ask for it onlyonce a week in the first place and this was agreed upon. A member suggested that the Head-Mistress of the Moharrek Girls*s school, who has already volunteered to give a talk on female education, should broadcast for the children once a week. 5.

The opinion of the public is that after the fall of Greece, Turkey, whose attitude is supposed to be ver^' inconsistent, having seen the example set to her by the fate of her neighbours, might prefer to give way to axis demands rather than fight. It is thought that then the big battle would take place between the British and GermansTelegram Q. From Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Resident, Bushire. No. 94 Dated the 28th April 1941. Public Opinion. After fall of Greece, Turkey may give way to Axis demands without fighting. Battle between British and Germans on Iraqi-Turkish frontier may follow. Politicaly/eekly Repor t _pf Public opinion in Bahrain . The pu blic seem o0 pleased by the successes of axis operations in Greece and Libya. The reason is that they are anti- British and are therefore pro-German. The chief cause of their anti-3ritishness is that they feel being down trodden b^^ the British whom they feel are responsible for almost every act of local authorities not only in Bahrain but also in other Gulf states and,because of the closer relations between the British and the local Government and the presence of a British Adviser, this feeling is greater about Bahrain. Added to this is the feelings about Palestine which though not so intense during the past fewr months seem to be going to be intensified by propaganda broadcasts from Baghdad. Baghdad seems to realize the feelings in Arab countries about Palestine and how to take advantage of it. Thus a grim description of the execution of Yusuf Abu Durrah who is said to be a Palestinian leader was broadcast on Friday evening from Baghdad. The announcer told the story in such moving tones that a listner would picture him with his eyes full of tears. No time of this incident was mentioned and most people believed^to be a fresh case yet this story was told several times, in different versions, by Berlin and Bari since the outbreak of the war. From now it may be expected that Baghdad will look for many such stories for propaganda purposes to invoke Arab hatred for the British. The news of the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq seem to have pleased most people while the others are anxious about the safety of Iraq from British action. It has also increased anti-British feelings. It is generally believed that German p, lanes will soon arrive in Iraq to help xfeaHfc against the British. The reason for public pleasure about hostilities in Iraq is that this might be the signal for a greater and more extensive revolt against the British and that it might set an example for Egypt and other Arab countries. reports of As far as the 1 Italiansnare -concerned/their ‘defeats are received with pleasure because they are looked up oh as 'beinghwoise it than Jthe British28/7 Telegram 'Q' From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, Bushire No. 109 Dated 4th May 1941 Outbreak in Iraq appears to be welcomed among certain sections of the population here and has somewhat stirred up anti British feelings. These sections seem to hope for an extension of the revolt to other Arab countries. 2. Observations indicate that apart from usual reasons for being anti-British such as Palestine etc there is a deep seated discontent with the local administration here which is blamed as the British. 3. It is generally believed that German planes will soon arrive in Iraq. - Political - r . r o Publicity Officer. 'Office of the Publicity Officer, Persian Gulf, Bahrain, Dated the 30th April 1941• Local interest is naturally focused on that part of the war which is nearest to us, that is to say, on the Balkans and the iJiddlo East and by comparison with our brilliant series of victories during the winter, nows of tho present situation in these areas is naturally discouraging. Even so, there are sono bright spots which tend to be obscurod by tho shadows, Goman losses have been really heavy, so nuch so that it is obvious from the information available that the momentum of their original attack has slowed down considerably. Secondly, Germany has been for some tine in economic control over and to a certain extent dependent on the Balkans* This fruitful area has now been ravaged and upset by war and instead of obtaining her needs by diplomatic means, Germany must now police the areas she wishes to plunder. Again, we my draw considerable comfort from Mr, Churchill’s opinion that he would sooner be in the shoes of d-eneral Wavell than in those of the German Commander in Libya and although it is possible that our reverses in Greece, due in major part, as in Norway and Flanders, to lack of local air superiority, may have a dispiriting effect on Turkey, there seems no doubt that they have contributed very largely D.Q.No. 186**22, 1 / Dear (X^jv^r- Major R.G.E.W.

You havo already heard of the results of the latest Gallup polls in the United States of the estab- lishnont of the Fight for Freed on Cormittee and of Roosevelt »s 'kite-flying’* in the forn of speeches by La Guardia and others in favour of active intervention in the Battle of the Atlantic# The accuracy of the polls and the already considerable influence of that section of the United States opinion which is non isolationist is fully indicated by the decision to reconnoitre all waters in the Western Henisphere oven into the conbat zone if necessary and to give warning of any danger to all peaceful ships* By ’’peaceful ships' is neant, any ship which is not an actual warship, whether belligerent or not. This will relieve our naval and air forces of a very considerable labour and enable them to concentrate exclusively on the protection of convoys from actual attack. 3. The Aoarican ship-building programme is quite staggering its dimensions. In addition to opening their ports to British ships for repair and re-fit, eight thousand million dollars are to be spent on 446 naval vessels, totalling million tons, 2 thousand million dollars on merchant shipping to build 451 craft aggregating million tons and con tracts are out for 342 patrol craft, 166 coastal and mine sweeping vessels and 1,504 small boats, such as amphibian tractors, landing barges and rescue crafts. When those figures are read with their present naval strength of 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 37 cruisers, 159 destroyers and 105 submarines and are coupled with the knowledge that 368 more naval vessels, including 17 battleships, 12 aircraft carriers, 54 cruisers, 205 destroyers and 80 submarines, are actually building on the stocks, they are truly impressive.-3- yn _ Those prograrmcs will no doubt take tino to © oonplcto but ovon In 1918 Anorican shipyards had ovolvod a toohnictuo whereby they could produce a standard 1 norchant vessel in 36 days and nodorn nothods will certainly shorten this period. As a final indication of Anorican dotemination that wo shall win the Battle of tho Atlantic, sono newspapers are even urging that Anorican pressure should bo brought to boar on tho G-ovornnent of Eire to pomit us to uso Irish basos. What then does all this portend for Hitler and what should bo our reactions locally? Hitler knows that to win this war, ho nust first cut our supply routo with Aneriea and then conquer England by invasion. So far as the Battle of the Atlantic is concerned, our not loss of shipping by onoray action since the outbreak of war to 24th April of this year has been 297 ships out of a total of 60,229 convoyed, giving a not loss in tonnage of only ono nillion out of an original total of 21 nillion tons or just under 5%. This cannot bo vory encouraging for the Nazis and provided wo aro given the tino to consolidate tho Atlantic so that the strean of ships bringing aid from Anorica can flow as speedily and in any volume as roquirod, nothing can stop us from winning a decisive and final victory.

ON the 30th January, 1941, Hitler proclaimed that “ every ship, with or I without convoy, which appears beiore our torpedo tubes is going to be torpedoed.” i the face of it, this announcement appears to be uncompromising; and the only qualification provided by the context is that the threats immediately preceding it are specifically addressed to the peoples of the American Continent. German commentators, however, subsequently tried to water it down by contending that Hitler was referring only to ships which attempted to enter the area within which the German ‘ ‘ total blockade ” is alleged to be in force. From one point of view it probably matters little what exactly was Hitler’s meaning, since the only conclusion that can be reached after a study of the facts of enemy warfare on merchant shipping is that enemy action in this field is never limited by the principles which are proclaimed by enemy spokesmen, but solely by the opportunities (or lack of them) which exist at any given time. Thus, as a previous paper on this subject has shown, the Germans, in utter disregard not only of international law but also of their own rules as set out in their Prize Ordinance, were regularly sinking merchant shipping, neutral as well as Allied,^) in the waters round Britain for at least ten months before the proclama tion of their “total blockade.” Equally, as will be seen from this paper, now that the “ total blockade ” has been proclaimed, they habitually make illegal attacks on ships outside as well as inside its area. There can be little doubt, indeed, that the frequency of such attacks is controlled by tactical and material considerations, but certainly not by the fact that the Germans themselves have chosen to limit the area of their blockade. Just as, at the beginning of the war, the range of German attacks was to some extent controlled by the position of their bases, and as it was extended by the acquisition of bases further west and south, so it might be expected to extend in the future, even across the Atlantic, if the Germans were to acquire suitable bases. One may perhaps discount Hitler’s announcement as a statement of immediate policy, for it is, in fact, a description of what the Germans^ so far as they were able, have already been doing almost from the beginning of the war; but it is none the less worth remembering against |*“ le background of the possibilities which might be developed in a German- controlled future. The German “ total blockade,” which was proclaimed on the 17th August, 1940, is not strictly a blockade at all. A blockade by definition must be “ effective,” that is to say, it must be maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the enemy’s coast. Not even the Germans themselves can claim this for their blockade of Britain. The “ total blockade ” is, in fact, analogous with the German proclamations of February 1915 and January 1917. The former of these declared the waters surrounding the United Kingdom a military area, in which all Allied merchant vessels would be destroyed, irrespective of the safety of the lives of passengers and crew, and in which neutral shipping would be exposed to similar danger in view of the uncertainties of naval warfare; and the latter proclaimed that all sea traffic would be prevented in certain prescribed zones round the Allied coasts, and that neutral ships would navigate these zones at their own risk. Similarly, the proclamation of the 17th August, 1940, warned neutrals that all waters round England had become an operations area, and that navigation in this area consequently involved danger of destruction for neutrals, for which the German Government disclaimed responsibility. Further, the Germans appear to base their claim to the right to enforce this measure on the ground of their ( 1 ) “ Allied ” in this paper includes British. [15—37]right to retaliate for alleged breaches of the rules of warfare by Britain, and not on the rights generally recognised to accrue to a belhgeient as a consequence of an effective blockade. , , „ i ,11 • j 1 .,1 The legitimacy of the “ total blockade should be judged therefore not upon the basis of the rules applicable to a true blockade, but lathei as a factor in the proclamation of a “war zone. In this connexion the following points become relevant:— To what extent are the grounds for retaliation alleged by Germany valid ? IP ^ 1 n; use E g abon {SB I s1 Lroonvo: 1. Ge The only accusations upon which even the Germans appear to lay any weight are, first, that the British sought to enforce the “ hunger blockade ” against Germany, and, secondly, that the British navicert system is illegal, and that neutrals who comply with it are committing an unneutral act. As regards the first accusation, it may suffice to quote Bismarck (as we did to the United States Government in 1915). Referring to the treatment of rice as contraband of war by belligerents in Chinese waters in 1885, a measure which incidentally interfered with German commercial interests, Bismarck said : “ 1 j measure in question has for its object the shortening of the war by increasing the difficulties of the enemy, and is a justifiable step in war if impartially enforced against all neutral ships.” It is clear, therefore, that, quite apart from the fact that the stoppage of all food-stuffs is an admitted consequence of any blockade, Bismarck regarded a so-called “ hunger blockade ” as a justifiable measure. In fact, of course, the Germans themselves from the very beginning of the war have made no distinction between combatants and non-combatants, and certainly in Germany to-day there is no clear division between those whom the Government is responsible for feeding and those whom it is not. The Germans cannot have it both ways. If they consider themselves justified in destroying the lives and property of civilians in towns and cities, and in killing merchant seamen, then surely we must be at liberty to prevent cargoes of food-stuffs from entering German-controlled ports. fl As regards the second accusation, the Germans have never succeeded in making clear exactly why they regard the navicert system as an illegal measure on Britain’s part. This is perhaps hardly surprising, since it is a method of control which is compulsory only in the sense that neutrals who do not comply with it may have to suffer whatever consequences we are in a position to enforce. As far as neutrals are concerned, the argument apparently runs that by sub mitting to it the neutrals are helping one belligerent, and thus neglecting their duty of impartiality. The answer to this seems to be that the duties of neutrals are defined by The Hague Conventions, in which there is nothing to forbid neutrals submitting to such a measure of control as is provided by the navicert system. No one has ever suggested that they would not just as willingly submit to a German navicert system, if the Germans could produce one that was work able, instead of sinking neutral ships without warning, or occupying neutral territories. In any case, so far as neutrals are concerned, the advantages derive^ from the system by the British are merely incidental to the advantage game by neutrals in not having to submit to contraband control on the high seas. If these arguments are accepted, it follows that the main grounds relied upon by the Germans to justify a retaliatory measure are totally inadequate. 2. Even if it were possible to justify a retaliatory measure, can this particular measure be justified? The overriding principle governing all reprisals the effect of which is not confined to the enemy is that the reprisals must not inflict upon neutral States a degree of hardship and inconvenience which is unreasonable in all the circumstances. The effect of the German “ total blockade ” is to prohibit neutral ships from entering an enormous stretch of sea round Britain (the area extends to about 500 miles west of Ireland, and from the latitude of Bordeaux to that of the Faroe Islands), upon pain of having their ships sunk without warning and their crews killed. As a matter of fact, at least thirty-two neutral ships, exclusive of those sailing in British convoys, have been sunk by enemy action since the declaration of the “ total blockade.” Details are not available in most cases, but there can be little doubt that the majority of these attacks were carried out without warning, and the death-roll is known to be several hundreds. Thus, apart from the effect on neutral trade, the German blockade inflicts upon neutral subjects a wholly disproportionate amount of suffering. ^ of this] jiist is &amp; tf .•lufroinei i(0je that t .fi! to stop, if they are s I liner liastorpedof Hires, ineli Mm squalls fi In the si four of the people wei iifc 11 eh 1 in a hlity of this pjWit disrec % Proh Wo, that ididnoter : «havekno P ®ilian pas P%his to ioiisly dimi ^of such at % on the Celled wit] id as Mother ,7 e are hi -u^lanth3 % lar ^(asJ wbaii;'- •rtialfi* rtfu| fimm le lan of tlie® : gtkfe it »t: from (i? r siffij* illegal ii is a it: ^wJfl iesoff tiingteii' g lat oviig^ pro®* 4 iad# (70#; Ukf f ti 1 3.

The development of enemy tactics in the war on shipping is a theme outside die scope of this paper, but two aspects of the matter may perhaps be mentioned. The first is the increase m the proportion of torpedo attacks without warning to gunfire attacks by submarines on the surface. Whereas for the first twelve months the ratio was rather under 3:1, for the last six months it is .pproximately 8 :1. Whatever may be the factors which contribute to this increase, the result must be that in many more cases the last shreds of legitimacy are torn from enemy submarine attacks. Not even the Germans can advance the excuse that they were entitled to sink a ship on account of her persistent refusal to stop, if she has never had a chance of seeing the submarine. The deplorable consequences of this type of warfare have been illustrated so often that they have almost’become a commonplace. It is only when people’s consciences are shocked by what seems a particularly brutal attack that it is realised how deplorable they are. The sinking of the City of Benares on the 17th September, 1940, is a good example of this. The City of Benares was an 11,000-ton liner with 191 passengers on board, including nearly 100 children. She was torpedoed without warning just outside the “ war zone,” with the loss of 258 lives, including seventy-seven children. It was blowing a gale, with hail and rain squalls and a very rough sea when the torpedo struck her at about 10 p.m. In the darkness and owing to the prevailing weather conditions, at least four of the twelve boats lowered were capsized. Others were swamped and many people were washed right out of them. In one boat alone 16 people, including 11 children, died from exposure; in another 22 died, including 15 children, in a third 21 died. The point to be emphasised is not the unusual brutality of this attack but rather that such results are inevitable when a belligerent disregards the rules of sea warfare as the Germans have done and are doing. Probably the commander of the U-boat did not know, when he fired his torpedo, that there were children on board the City of Benares. It may be that he did not even know the name of the ship, although there is strong evidence that he must have been dogging her for some hours before torpedoing her. What he must have known, however, was that this was a large merchant ship, probably with civilian passengers on board, certainly with a crew of merchant seamen. Ne knew the state of the weather, and he knew that they were 600 miles from xand. Yet he followed them outside the blockade area and deliberately abstained from firing his torpedo until after nightfall, when the chances of rescue would be enormously diminished. The enemy cannot disclaim responsibility for the results of such attacks, any more than he can disclaim responsibility for attacks like that on the Severn Leigh, which was first torpedoed without warning and then shelled with shrapnel by the submarine while the crew were trying to abandon ship. At least eight of the crew were killed by the shell-fire, and nineteen died as a result of exposure during a thirteen days’ voyage in an open boat. Five others, including the ship’s cook, were left on a raft with only one biscuit and a small bottle of water between them. They were several times washed off the raft by the rough seas. Two of the five died and were thrown overboard. Two others died later. A fortnight after the sinking of the Severn Leigh, the raft was found with the two decomposed bodies and the cook still alive. There are hundreds of similar stories, stories of voyages for days in open boats in Atlantic gales, of men in the water clinging for hours to a raft and gradually dropping off one by one, of crews being machine-gunned as they tried to lower their boats or as they drifted away in them, of seamen being blown to pieces by shells and torpedoes and bombs. The enemy must know that such things are the inevitable results of the type of warfare he has chosen to employ. i i4 /j. The second development of enemy tactics which may be briefly referred to is the increSd use of aircraft against merchant ships. It is true that the German PrizrOrdfnance applies only to naval vessels, but it is a well-established rule of I nze ummaiiice FF Q h n nld not be sunk without being first summoned to suTrender^nd an attack without such a summons must be as illegal for aircraft as for warships The Germans have never attempted to conform to the rules of wa, TnThis respect Their attacks on merchant shipping from the air have never regarded whether the ship was a neutral or a belligerent, whether it was convoyed by warships or not, whether it was armed or whether it was an unarmed trawler actually engaged in fishing. In almost every attack the aircraft have used their machine guns or cannon, as well as bombs It is obvious that these machine-gun attacks, which oan do little damage to the vessel, must be primarily directed against the crew. It is true that most Allied vessels are now fitted with defensive armament against aircraft, but this was not so until some hundreds of attacks had been made on unarmed vessels A v The Fiihrer’s announcement that unconvoyed as well as convoyed ships w. in future be torpedoed is not exactly news. The avowed aim of the Germans, as announced by Admiral Raeder on the 28th January, 1941, is to cut oS mercilessly British imports and destroy Britain s power to live. The same speaker referred to the German war on merchant shipping as a heroic struggle ” Other Germans, U-boat commanders and aircraft pilots have described with relish how they singled out their unsuspecting victims, carefully choosing those of the largest size. We may be forgiven for failing to see anything very heroic in the torpedoing of the City of Beuoves, or the sinking of 'the Severn Leigh, or of the hundreds of other merchant vessels, from the A thenia down to a Faroese fishing smack with a crew of seven. Even the German officers who gloat over their successes do not make much pretension to heroism. One of them compared his work to that of a wolf among a flock of sheep. The comparison is the enemy’s, as the choice of warfare was his : and it is surely right that these facts should be put on record.

There are a few, however, who think that the decision is a very wise one and that it was made with the object of saving the country from disaster. There are mahy persons, both Arabs and Persians, who do not seem to have understood the situation and have been showing surprise at the news of the continuation of the British and Russian advance, as they thought that the Iranian decision would result in the immediate withdrawal of the British and Russian forces. There are some doubts in the minds of j&amp;s many about the sincerity of the Anglo-Russian assurances that they have no territorial aims in Iran. And many could be heard arguing about the matter with some such remarks as: r, would you believe that they will leave a country once they have occupied it' and 'do you think that they will leave Iran after the war without, at least, taking the oil district'. Iranian seamen and smugglers are very much pleased by the capture of the 4 Iranian gun boats and the sinking of the two sloops, they feel at last free ±bl of this hinderance to their operations.

Public opinion appears to be in confusion as regards Japanese successes in Malaya and Burma, but it is generally believed that the Japanese have been victorious for the present and might be able to overrun the whole of Malaya peninsula and even Australia if the Allies do not render quick help to the fullest extent. It is also thought that the arrival of American troops in Northern Ireland is either to relieve the British troops which are required for some other fronts or to launch a surprise attack either on Germany or on one % ■ of her occupied countries. The news of the evacuation of Benghazi by British troops has not been received with pleasure. ^T e l egram From Q. •Political Agent, Bahrain Political Resident, Bushire To No. 87 Bated the 31st January 1942.

The public are much impressed by the Japanese victories in Malay and the Far East and think that it may be difficult for the Americans to help the British in India if Singapore is occupied by them. They also think that after the fall of Singapore the Japanese will be more free to threaten the shipping by spreading their submarines in the Indian Ocean. As regards the Russian front some people think that the success of the Russians depends on the amount of war materials supplied to them by the Allies while others think that the temporary retreat of the Germans is due to winter and will again defeat the Russian^in the next spring.Telegram From To Q. * olitical Agent, Bahrain Political Hesident, Bushire Ho. 106 Bated the 7th February 1942.

The news of the defeat of the British in Libya, Singapore, Burma and the Dutch Indies has been received with much pleasure and the general opinion is that the British will not be able to check the advance of the Japanese whose next move will be to invade India and to blockade the Indian ports and the Persian Gulf. Some people think that the defeat is due to the slackness of the Americans to whom the defence of the Pacific has been entruste&lt; They also think that Marshal Kai-Shak will not get any benefit by his visit to India as the Indians are helpless themselves and depend on the support of the British. Most people feel almost certain that Germany will ultimately win the war though the British might be able to hold on for some time. dTelegram n o n From Political Agent, Bahrain.

In view of the Japanese victories over a vast area in the Pacific, it is generally thought that the British and the Americans have been defeated in the Far East and will not be able to check their advance towards .India as the Indians who are said to be sxiot against the British &lt;vill no- ^i„nt against the Japanese and will surrender to them. The escape of the “erman warships and the appearanc of German and Japanese submarines in American waters is thought to be due to the weakness of the British and American navy. The speeches of Mr. Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt are considered to contain nothing but an account of the Allied defeats. - ^ h~ P-&amp; k-*&lt;**/- 'A .

To The Political Agent BahrainWeekly report of public opinion in Bahrain In view of Japanese quick successes in the Pacific and Burma and the occupation of Java the public are of opinion and almost certain that the next Japanese target will be the invasion of Australia and the blockading of the Indian ports. They also think that the Indians, who will not be deceived by the British promises which are going to be given to them about their independence, will welcome the Japanese in India and will give them all possible help to hasten their occupation of India instead of fighting in defence of British Empire. They say that if the British promises were of any value they would not have left the Dutch in Java and elsewhere unaided and would have helped the* till the last moment. It is generally thought that even if the Americans send a large fleet to the Pacific they will not be able to shake the Japanese from the places which thsy have been occupied by then The public do not give much importance to the Russian successes as they believe that the Germans will carry out a large scale attack on the Russians next month and will give them such a hard blow in consequence of which they may not be able to revive. A small party of people think that the British might launch an attack on France in order to engage the Bermans on another front, and if they do so the Russians might be relie'wed to some extent, but if the British do not make any auazx move the Germans will win the war after defeating the Russians.=»■** Y *) GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, —_.
