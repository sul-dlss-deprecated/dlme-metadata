British Hmhassy, Bagdad. 22nd March, 1934 \\o K \ f fv I w V * ( ^ Sir, With reference to th»? last/paragraph of my telegram No = 3(Saving) of March 5ncl last, l have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Honourable the Political Resident in the -to • to me - ersian Gulf, (a copy of which has been sent/direct at the request of the latter), forwarding statements prepared by the Shaikh of Kuwait which purport to reveal the extent of the losses which he has suffered by reason of the imposition of the istihlak tax on the produce of his properties in Iraq which were covered by the promise of revenue exemption given by His Majesty's Government in 1914. 2. It will be observed that the Shaikh claims to have suffered a loss of IN. 5 ,626/ ,7 44 (the correct total of the items on Statement VI, the summary, is, however, IN. 5 ,654/174 in the two years 1932 and 1^33 during ^hi ch the new form of taxation has been operative. This total is inclusive of a number of controversial items, which, as the Political Agent explains, have been inserted at his invitation in order that the Shaikh should put on record full particulars of all losses which he considers he has sustained, whether direct or indirect. Whilst I am of the opinion that the figures contained in the statements are not exaggerated, 1 consider that it is open to grave doubt whether it would be correct f0 tal&lt; f the whole of them into account. 3. ''■•he object to be attained by the submisalon of the ShaikMs/ ‘^he Night Honourable Sir John Simon,G. (J.SIKJC.C.V.O. , otc. etc. etc.* C 2 &gt; 1 -p- Shailch’s claim is ar? assessment of the cash losses he has suffered as a direct refmlt of the taxation levied, bv means o^ the istihlak tax, on the produce of his tax-exempted gardens, and I have the honour to submit the following obser vations on them in this light» 4« Statements I and XI give particulars of the istihlalc tax paid on dates exported from Iraq by merchants who have bought them from the Shaikh. 'Tie argument in this instance is that if the istihlak tax had not been payable the Shaikh, would have received, that much more in the L * M\ r purchase price of his da^es. It is clear that the tax was 1 paid by exporting merchants, although from the Political ^esident’s confidential despatch ho.C/lt of 6th December, 1931, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, it was anticipated that the Shaikh would pay th&lt;* tax from his own resources, as the merchants were Kuwaiti dhow-owners who took the dates for sale on credit. Adequate Particulars of these payments are given and it would be possible to check them if this is thought necessary. am inclined to think, however, that checking is not necessary and would not be of much ^alue. it would be impossible to prove that the cargoes of dates on which the tax was paid were actually the produce of the 'exempted'gardens. Apart from this consideration 1 see no reason to question the accuracy of the figures contained in these two statements. 5* 'fhere is, however, considerable doubt whether the amounts mentioned are equivalent to the cash loss suffered by the Shaikh. It is open to question whether he would, in fact, have received a sale-price grater by 10% if the istihlak tax had not been payable X. : S ‘fhe pri ce would probably/-3- probably have been higher, but it in doubtful whether he would have received the whole 10%. -Prior to the introduction of the istihlak tax, the customs export duty- on dates was Z%; it was reduced to 1% when the istahlak tax of 10% was introduced. Dates exported by the Shaikh, or by merchants who purchased them from the Shaikh, have never been exempt from customs export duty except the relatively small quantity sent to Kuwait for his household use. The charge on exported dates is now 11^ as against the former Z% and the correct formula for calculating the loss in the sale ori ce of the dates is not 10% but 8% of thei: value. Applying this correction to the figures supplied, the totals of Statements I and II become IB.706/OS? and t b. 79?/l6° respeetivelv. 6. Statement III shows the amount of isti-hlak tax and 1 export dutiespaid bv the Shaikh on produce exported for his household consumption. The promise given on behalf of Fis Majesty’s Government only guaranteed him immunity from the payment of taxes onhis gardens and ? in my opinion, customs duties are not in the same category as the i*tahlak tax and cannot be construed as being a tax on the land. Fy an oversight on the part of t*e Iraqi Customs the Shaikh had -^or some years been allowed to export bis house hold requirements free duty, but the concession was withdrawn two years ago. The amount paid as customs duty for the two years is ID* 2 ?/ 430 and I suggest that this amount should be deleted from the statement. The istihlak il tax which the Shaikh paid on such exports is an admissible item, provided that all the exports came from the exempted gardens, and the full amount might be admitted, i.e. ID 0 162/?08 for the two years 1932 /8 ,/ 1932 o. 0 IB 45/499. 1933 IB.117/S09 o 7. The items in Statement IV are contentious. The Shaikh claims that, because of the introduction of the istahlak tax, he was obliged to give an extra one-tenth of the crop as compensation to certain of his cultivators who became liable to pay the tax on their share. He regards the value of the dates so handed over as a loss falling on him. It is arguable that these transactions, the details of which are only susceptible of proof by examination of the Shaikh’s books, should be regarded as a domestic matter affecting the relations between the Shaikh and his tenants, i.e. as a revision of share arrangements such as might be necessary at any time between landlord and tenant . Hi S Majesty’s Government have no responsibility for, or authority over, the division of the produce. It is very doubtful whether tMs revision can he accepted as affecting the promise of His Majesty’s Government that the Shaikh’s gardens shouid be free from taxation. If the Shaikh were compensated for the revision in percentage, His Majesty’s Government would in effect be buying a large quantity of datesfrom him for presentation to his cultivators. O n the other hand , the Shaikh can fairly claim that he has had to forego part of his saleable share of the pro du ce as a direct result of the istihlak tax. The amounts involved are large, IB.439/315 for 1932, and IB.531/595 1933, and if admitted in principle will represent a substantial annuity. ^he inclusion of this large item an assessment of the Shaikh’s recoverable losses on account of ifctihlak taxation r )sii d can, in ny opinion, fairly 'be resisted.Statement V is a list of losses sustained as a result of fhe recalcitrance of certain of the Shaikh f s cultivators, '''he difficulties encountered 'by fbe Shaikh are described in ray despatch ^o.477 of July 25th last, the Resident in the Persian Gulf ’s con di fen ^ia 1 despatch XJo. 943/3 of August fnd last t© the Secretary of State for India, and connected correspondence . I suggest that His rKa.l est'^s Government in thie Tluited Kingdom have never undertaken to insure the Shaikh against losses arising out of disputes between his cultivators and himself, whatever the cause of the dis agreement. Antj^ absentee landowner is liable to suffer loss if his ter an + s become rebellious, and the promise given to the Shaikh that his gardens should be held free of taxation cannot, in my opinion , properly be stretched so as to establish a claim against His Majestv T s Government for the refhnd of losses and expenses arising out of troubles concerned with the administration of his estates. It would not he unreasonable to exclude this claim entirely, 9.

No doubt all kinds of holes can be found by lawyers and destructive critics in the way the Shaikh has presented more than a Bedouin State, and the methods of his Agents and clerical staff are of the simplest imaginable. As things are the Shaikh has done well, in my opinion, to have kept serious accounts at all, and the case he has presented is to my mind a reasonable, and fair one, nor has he made the mistake of exaggerating. 5. I fcr one am in favour of accepting the Shaikh’s claims as they stand, and am not for damaging His Majesty’s Government’s prestige and good name further, by attempting to give with one hand, and take back with the other, which the process of fT wiittling” dom after ail means. 6.

Surely it is up to everyone of us to see that the fullest and most generous form of restitution is made, when we have the opportunity of doing so. 7.

What this date may be is not certain, but it might well be the 31st teay 1931, the ante on which the letihlak tax was introduced, and on which the Hhaikh was forced by the ’Iraq Government to pay taxes, the introduction of the Istihl&amp;k tax* detail, however, only on the claim under III (b) above since/-5- since while the miri we in operation the hheikh paid nothing to the ’Iraq Government* this argument i» correct # then for calculating the compensation which His Hajesty*® Government should pay to the Shaikh for the future we are only concerned with a computation based on wi^at he ha© paid under the Istihlak tax* This is 10 a» a© laid down by the ’Iraq Government* ‘7• A proportion of thi® tax the Shaikh, as producer, has presumably passed on to the consumer, as is the custom all the world over, and His excellency the Ambassador has referred to this at the beginning of his paragraph 5.

The inclusion of t is large item in an assessment of the Shaikh*© recoverable losses on account of latihlak taxation paid can, in my opinion, fairly be resisted**# fhe first sentence of this quotation would prim facie seem to be inconsistent with the last sentence. 12.

The Iraqi Government, however, did not consider the order of exemption issued fey the Civil Commissioner in 1917 as being binding upon them, and it was not included in the promise given to the Shaikh of Kuwait on behalf of His Majesty's Government in 1914. The Customd Department can only take cognisance of exemptions or concessions granted by law. The exemption had no basis in statute or agreement and was, in fact, illegal. Immediately it came to the notice of the British Director of Customs and Kxcise, orders were issued to the Collector at Basrah to discontinue the practice. The Director of Customs and Excise informed members ofthe staff of the late High Commission that the free export of these products had been permitted by the Collector of Customs irregularly, without the knowledge of the Directorate, and that it was a pure oversigilt that the export, free of duty, had been permitted 4.

If you will refer to the relevant passage in Sir Francis Humphrys’ despatch quoted above you will observe that his reason for suggesting that the correct formula was 8% was that at the time of the introduction of the istihlak tax the customs export duty was reduced by 2%. This ■ reduction in customs export duty, which has nothing to do with the previous miri tax and in respect of which the Shaikh was never promised exemption, was an integral part of the new system of taxation on dates introduced by the Iraqi Government. Had the merchants purchased the dates before ^ ----- ' the The Hdnourable the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B u s h i r e.i -2 the introduction of the isti&amp;lak tax they would have paid 3% of their value as customs duty on report.

The net loss to the Shaikh, through the merchants, is therefore 8% , ;&gt;/ ■ li of the value of the &lt;rop and not 10%, and this appears to be the correct percentage to take for the purpose of assessing his losses consequent upon the introduction of the istihlak system. 4.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith in continuation of paragraph 12 of Sir Francis Humphrys’ despatch of March 22nd last, No. 162, a copy of the correspondence which has passed between His Majesty’s Embassy and the agent in Basrah of the Shaikh of Mohammerah regarding the losses incurred by the Shaikh as a result of the levy of istihlak tax on the produce of his exempted properties in Iraq. 2. The agent of the Shaikh claims that his principal has been put to losses on this account to a total of ID.1,938/884 during the year 1932 and ID.2,554/708 during the year 1933. 3. The figures of quantity contained in his claim, in the absence of supporting vouchers, have not been checked. It would in fact be impossible to verify them without an exhaustive examination of the books kept by the agent, as, although proof might be forthcoming that he actually sold on behalf of the Shaikh the quantities of dates mentioned in the claim, there would be no certainty that they were the produce of the tax-exempted properties, or that they did not include the value of produce purchased by the agent from the share of the crop due to the cultivators on the estates. 4. it is pertinent to the consideration of the claim that it is in respect of a quantity of dates considerably larger than that covered by the similar claim of the Right Honourable Sir John Simon etc. , G-.C.S.I. , K.C.V.O. , etc., etc. ShaikhShaikh of Kuwait, although the exempted estates of the latter were assessed hy the revenue authorities of the Iraqi Government as having twice the hearing capacity of the former. Omitting the figures of compensation paid to cultivators in each case, the Shaikh of Kuwait's claim accounts for 2,625 tons of dates in 1932 and 2,024 tons in 1933, whereas the Shaikh of Mohammerah claims to have disposed of 4,264 tons in 1932 and 4,265 tons approxi mately in 1933. 5. It is also significant that the claim for 1933 is in respect of an equal quantity of dates as that for 1932, whereas it is well known that the 1933 crop was a poor one which on no estate produced a crop of more than 70fo of that of 1932, and in most cases considerably less. 6. The values at which the quantities have been converted into cash have been checked with those ruling in Basrah during the period covered by the claim, and there appears to be no grounds for questioning their accuracy. The items in the claim, when analysed, fall into the following categories.- 1932 . 1933 . ID. ID. Compensation paid to cultivators on account of their liability to pay istihlak tax on their shares. .. 759/613 968/214 Dates from exempted estates sold to merchants. . . 531/435 1,229/000 Duty paid on dates exported. . . 647/836 357/494 Total. .. 1,938/884 2,554/708 7 .'ft 7. Sir Francis Humplirys commented in detail in paragrapn 7 of nis despatcn No, 162 of Marco 22nd last regarding toe admissibility of item 1 in tne similar claim submitted by tne Snaikh of Kuwait and came to the conclusion tnat the amount of the claim could fairly be excluded in assessing the amount of compensation to be paid. Those comments are equally applicable in this instance. 8. Item 2, which represents 1Q&amp; of the sale price of the dates, is divisible into two categories: (a) Dates on which the purchaser paid the istihlak tax, and (b) Dates which were sold on the understanding that the purchaser would deduct the tax from the price. In each case the inference is that the agent would have received an additional !&lt;$&gt; in cash if the dates had been sold with no liability to istihlak taxation, but it is by no means certain that the full additional 10$ would have accrued to the Shaikh. It is not possible to effect any useful comparison with the claim of the Shaikh of Kuwait, as he, with his much larger estates, sold very little produce within Iraq, whereas this claim is in respect of 1,600 tons of dates in 1932 and 2,500 tons in 1933. 9. Item No. 3, which deals with the loss consequent upon istihlak tax having to be paid on dates exported abroad, needs revision in the light of the remarks contained in paragraph 5 of Sir Francis Humphrys f despatch of March 22nd last, which explains that the correct figure of loss should be Qf 0 of the export value and not 10^. The application of this correction reduces the claim under this item/item to ID.518/268 for 1932 and ID. 285/995 for 1933, 10. By the omission of item No. 1 end the reduction of item No. 2, the total claim is brought down to the following;- 1932 .. ID. 1,049/703 1933 .. ID. 1,514/995 11. I have, however, given reasons in paragraphs4 and 5 for doubting the veracity of the statements made by the Shaikh’s agent, wnose commercial morality is in many quarters suspect. Enquiries which have been made confidentially from the Manager of the African and Eastern Company, who are very large date buyers and possess considerable knowledge of all date estates in Basrah, go to show that it is extremely unlikely that the exempted estates of the Shaikh of Mohammerah have ever produced dates to the extent of the claim, and after mature reflection, I have reached the conclusion that the statements rendered by the agent are exaggerated and misleading. I am supported in this by the comparison with the figures contained in the carefully prepared claims of the Shaikh of Kuwait waich Sir Francis Humphrys has stated he considers represent a fair statement of the position. 12. For practical purposes it will probably be more suitable to ignore the so-called statement of claim and to assess the amount of compensation to be given to the Shaikh of Mohammerah at 50^ of that awarded to the Shaikh of Kuwait, this proportion being based upon the respective former land revenue assessments of the two sets of properties. 13. The Financial Secretary will, on receipt of this despatch, be in the United Kingdom on leave of absence and will/will be available to discuss any points on which you may require further explanation, I have, etc. (Signed) GEORGE OGILVIE FORBESp.z.5563/34 Enclosure in Bagdad Despatch Wo.390 of 12.7.1934.

The Financial Secretary to H.E.the British Ambassador Baghdad. Sir I am in receipt of your communication Bo.202/5/34 dated 24th February 1934 regarding this istihlak tax paid on the dates belonging to His Excellency Shaikh Sir Khazaal Khan during 1932 and 1933. I would beg to point out, at the outset, that it is almost impossible to produce the receipt for the istihlak tax paid on all the dates referred to, because of the following reasons:- (1) Before the istihlak was introduced, 1he fellahs used to supply the Shaikh with 60/o of the produce; but with the introduction of the istihlak tax, the fellahs supplied him with 56$ only, the difference being allowed to them to enable them to pay the istihlak tax on their share. The fellahs have not taken out receipts for their shares and it is not possible for them to obtain these. They must have sold their dates to various parties, who have paid the istihlak tax thereon, and it is certain, in my humble opinion, that they cannot trace the istihlak receipts for the quantities sold by them. I am, however, ^possession of the agreements made with the fellahs on different properties showing the fact that they have been allowed 4$ in excess of their previous shares to enable them to pay the istihlak tax. (2) Some of the dates belonging to the Shaikh have been sold to different merchants at Basrah and these merchants have themselves paid the istihlak tax to the Government when they exported those dates from Basrah together with other dates bought by them from other parties. The only method in which we can prove the fact is to obtain a certificate from each buyer showing the quantity bought by him, and the date and number of the customs receipt or declaration that he has paid the tax on the dates. I shall be glad to be informed as to whether I should take the necessary action to obtain such certificates. (3) Some of the dates have been sold to merchants on the understanding that they deducted the istihlak tax from the price. May I obtain certificates from the purchasers to this effect? Some /Some of the dates have been shipped abroad on the Shaikh’s account and I can produce the necessary customs documents showing that istihlak tax has been paid thereon. I shall collect these and keep them in readiness to be used ■ in case of need. With regard to para. 4 of your communication under reference, I beg to inform you that the statements submitted by me only relate to those properties now belonging to my principal which were in his possession prior to 1914. I must conclude with an apology for the delay which has taken place in submitting this reply. It was in part due to the fact that I have had to go to Kuwait for a few days in regard to the affairs of my principal at that place. I trust to be able to avoid such a delay in future.

JV]y object in writing now is merely to confirm what I said over the telephone; namely that, although I agree l that we want to get the whole of this question liquidated as quickly as possible, I think it would be Sl better, in view of the action now being taken at Bagdad, to await its results- If Humphrys is successful in. , settling the question of title, such settlement should be reached within the next fortni a ht, and the question of compensation can then at once be tackled. In that case there will be no real oelay. If, on the: other hand, Humphrys* efforts shoula fail, we should have to concentrate anew on the title question, and that of compensation woula therefore have to be postponed. In these circumstances I hope you will agree to our holding our hanu for a little while longer.GQBfmMlTUb * xoXxtlo&amp;l Kwmtt* Ttte ~mth iiurQh 19 »# From Uout-Colonal H.R*P.

A y a 4 tpl In contimoation of my Confidential letter No,0-77, dated^,the 26th March and your ccmfidential menorandum No. 342-S, dated idle 29th April 1935 in reply to same: I have the honour to forward herewith translations of the following letters which have passed between myself and H.E. the Shaikh of Kuwait on the subject of the 'losses' which he has had to incur in the shape of taxation, on his 'exempt' Bate Gardens during 1934 as a result of the introduction of Hie Istahlak system of Taxation, as well as A ^ ^ in figh'W.ttg his rebellious fellaheen:- : 'A' Confidential letter No.C-126, dated 8.5.35 from the Political Agent to H.E. the Shaikh. ^ ’ ( .

As regards 'A', *B n , and '0', these speak for them selves and I have little to add wo #h&amp;t 1 said in my confidential despatch Ho.C-87, when I forwarded the Shaikh’s 'claims' against His Majesty’s Government i or the years - 932 3 -/ and 1933\ 2 / 5, Begarding H.M*s Ambassador letter 162, dated 22nd M March 1334 in which he criticized the Shaikh’s figures for 1932 and 1933 and with which you were in part agreement, (Yiae Bushire confidential despatch No,477-a, dated 28th May 1934 to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India) I would refer you again to my confidential despatch No.C. 157, dated 1st May 1934 and would rery respectfully say that I feel compelled to still hold the same views as I expressed then. 4. In that letter I pointed out that for political reasons and especially for the s&amp;':e of our good name among Arabs we should not cavil at the .Shaikh’s figures, or attempt to 'whittle 1 down his claims, but accept them 'en bloc'. 5. I added that although it might be easy for those living at a distance to pick holes in the Shaikh’s figures and criticise the way he had presented his various claims , we should not forget that his was little more than a Bedouin States and that the methods of his Agents and Clerical Staff were of the simplest imaginable. That as things were the ohalkh had done well to have kept serious accounts at all, and that the case he had presented was a reasonable and fair one, nor had he made the mistake of exaggerating. —— 6. Just in the same way as I supported the Shaikh’s ^ 1932 and 1933 figures, so now I am in favour of accepting his 19 34 claims as they stand, seeing that we have already harmed the Shaikh and our good name to an immeasurable degree, by our third year failure to implement our promises in this matter of his gardens. We certainly want to give no encouragement to our Arab enemies (always active) to say, that even when His Majesty’s Government did at length decide to settle the gardens question and reimburse the iihaikh for his losses, she only paid him half what he claimed and got out of the other half by one sophist argument or another. 7. I quite realize - and 1 say this with all respect - that speaking from the British Taxpayers point of view, both you and H.M* s Ambassador, may find it somewhat hard to seeto see wliy His Majesty’s Government should have to pay the Shaiidi, for instance, for the immense losses (financial and otherwise) which he claims to have incurred in fighting his re calcitrant fellaheen. But, if we are to admit that the disturbances among the fellaheen originated, and have con tinued for the last 3 years as a result of direct encouragement and incitement of the Iraq Government, (of which in my opinion there can be no shadow of doubt) then surely His Majesty’s Government must accept the responsibility, seeing that it was up to her to see that Iraq did not behave as she has done and allow her spite to outrun her reason. Let us not forget that until the Iraq Government got control, successive Shaikhs of Kuwait had never had any trouble at all with their tenants. 8. The Shaikh’s own way of putting it is that, as all his date garden difficulties, have arisen as a direct result of His Majesty’s Government’s failure to settle the Date garden trouble, and that as such failure has each year given added encouragement to the Iraq Government to intrigue among his tenants, and instigate them to refuse to pay him his landlord’s share, and even challenge his title - therefore all expenses incurred by him in his lone fight for his rights, whether in the Basra Courts, or in the gardens themselves, should in justice be borne by His Majesty’s Government, who after all did promise that his gardens should free of taxation^be his, and remain unassailable. The least that His Majesty’s Government could have nr done, according to the Shaikh, should have been to appoint an English Lawyer to come out to Basra and conduct the fight that was going on in the local courts ann in the gardens. It was not enough to bring the diplomatic pressure they ha/e ^ done in Baghdad. ^ 9. I earnestly trust that while there is yet time, you will see your way to modify some of Hie remarks passed in your letter No.477-S of 28th May 1934 to H.M’s Secretary of4 Secretary of State for India, and will use your utmost endeavour with His Majesty’s Government to prevent any vital 'whittling” down of the shaikh’s old 1952 and 1955 claims, and now his 19 34 ones. 10. As regards statement n G ,f and enclosure: This I am passing on for your information only. Mr. Gabriel thought fit to send me at the beginning of the year a statement showing what he had done by way of service to the Shaikh s#inee he was appointed agent. Underlying the letter was his hope that I would speak to uiia Shaikh privately and get his pay raised. 11. The statement is interesting as showing among other things (a) Mr.Gabriel's conviction that the Iraq Government were behind all the garden troubles, and were therefore the last people it was wise for him to apply to for help: (b) The pitifully tortuous methods used by Mr. Gabriel in trying to get the better of rebellious fellaheen whom he knew were being supported by Gov ermae nt of f i c ials . 12. In putting forward Mr. Gabriel’s report, I wish it to be understood that it should not be quoted as an authority, firstly because it was sent to me for my personal use only, and secondly because'it contains a number of inaccuracies. 13. Mr.Gabriel, though apparently he has done his best in the face of many difficulties, for his client, has, I feel sure, been compelled to ran with the hare as well as hunt with the hounds at time$. He has even confessed to me on more than one occasion that he has received many warnings from high Iraqi officials, that his taking up the cudgels on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait was a definitely unhealthy and dangerous occupation and would end in disaster for himself. Unfortunately politics appear to be so mixed up with the administration of justice in Iraq, that I doubt if the Shaikh could have// 5 could have found a more satisfactory lawyer to serve him than Mr* Gab riel.

With kindest regards and due respects. I aiji, Yofcrs ever sincerely, Sd. J.Gabriel. Lieut-Colonel H.R.P* Dickson, Political Agesat, KuwaitCOPY SOBICTLY C ONfflDJUKTlAL.

CLASSIFIGATION. Note by P.A . Class (A) *Not to be con fused with (B) ’exempted’ gardens of same name (VAJERAWIYA) ■ originally given to Sharifa daughter of Mubarak as mb marriage portion when she took Saud al Mohamet al Sabah for husband. That garden is now in Maryam’s hands and is managed by her private agent in Basra, Thunaian al Ghanim. (Maryam another daughter of (D) Mubarak married Saud when Sharifa died). Fao date palms, unregistered in Tapu Departmen t. Dewassir called otherwise n ffarhania n and ' Koshaishia ' registered in Tapu Department; in the name of Shaikh Mubarak’s sons. ffADDAGHIYA registered in Tapu Depart ment, in tie hame of Shaikh Mubarak’s sons. MUTAW’A registered in Tapu Department, in the neme of Shaikh Mubarak’s sons. SUFIYA and*AJERAWIYA registered in the name of Shaikh Hamood al-Jar rah as- Sabah but mortgaged with H.E.Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir.-as-Sabah. Five houses and ten shops at ’’Basrah City” registered in Tapu Department in the name of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Ahma d al Jabir as Sabah. AGENCY I was appointed as general agent for H.E. on and from the 1st January 1933 for a yearly retention fee of Rs. 2100/- on the clear under standing that X was only to act as lawyer for H.E. in the Law Courts in such law suits as might be rarely necessary to institute against some few troublesome fellahins.2 i o’2 ] LA i SUITS IN 1933 . In February 1933, I was instructed through Abdul Aziz Salem a 1 Bader, His excellency’s previous general agent (dismissed for incompetence shortly afterwards) to file 25 suits fir the recovery of arrears of dates due by certain Ta f abs in Fao(who had undoubtedly been got at by certain agents of the IHAq Government). But owing to non-existence of written contracts, the defendents submitted a written statement objecting to the ex-parte judgement issued against them by denying H.E’s ownership to the Fao property (a step who were foreseen by those/behind them). At this stage the said Abdul Aziz, notwithstand ing my warning, filed an ejectment suit (through another lawyer whom he had appointed as sub-agent for H.S.) against the ring leader called Jassim Ala’ama who claimed in his defence (through his lawyer Ibrahim Naji) that be and certain of his colleagues were the rightful owners of Fao property and not H.S. the Shaikh, whereupon Court ordered H.B’s lawyer to pro duce a Tapu title deed to prove H.S’s ownership, and the right to claim the ejectment of the defendentj and Fao property being of class 'A* no title deed was in existence, and therefore as a choice between tfe© evils the suit was dropped, under my advice, by non- appearance of H.S 1 s aforementioned sub-agent ( It was for this that the Shaikh’s previous Agent was dis missed) . ADVICE . Having studied the whole position and under the circumstances X advised H.B. not to take any legal action unlessi- (1) The Fao property be registered in Tapu. (2) Letters of Administration be obtained inHis Excellency’s favour, (3) Transfer of the properties class 'B” and 'C* from th© name of the deceased owners be effected in the name of their respective legal living survivors. (4) The Shaikh’s local representatives at Fao be removed, (5) H.B’s secretary and his attaches be precluded from interfering in the affairs of administration of H. E’s properties in Basrah district, (6) A responsible agent be appointed and invested with full authority for administration and general management. CQITOPMCB &amp; iamiORITY . His Excellency very kindly placed his confidence in id me and not only appointed me his layer and agent but gave me full authority to do what I thought fit (a) In keeping up his prestige (b) In safeguarding his interests; but H.l* at the sane time pointed out that under existing circum stances it was practically impossible for him to comply with my aforesaid advice in the matter of paragraphs (1) to (S) above for reasons given elsewhere and known to you. REMEDY . Seeking redress in the Courts under the conditions and circumstances prevailing at the time, was in fact quite impossible, and as to the Government Administrative authorities, no assistance could be expected of them, so I was indeed in a very critical position during the 1953 (SEPT.) date season in as much as the crop was ripe, and the Ta’ab were at the height of their opposition and disturbance. I therefore adopted a diplomatic attitude towards them and appointed their abovementioned 7t ring loader n (Jassim A1 A’ama as my representative on a salary of Ps. 150 a month, and gave certain wages and privileges to his companions. He and his companions accepted the appointment provided (1) that all hhe law suits pending against them in the courts were forthwith dropped (2)—4— that they be allowed to divide the produce on 50 and 50 basis. To this I agreed on condition that they for thier part undertook in writing to deliver His Excellency’s share without specifying the basis of division in the contract. MTIQM/WT . The aforedaid arrangement was carried out quite loyally and peacefully almost by all the Ta’abs and every thing seemed bright. But due to the interference of His Excellency’s secretary, some fifteen head ta’abs presented themselves in Kuwait afcd offered to deliver 56% of the produce to His Excellency alleging that all other ta’abs would follow suit; and despite my appeal, His Excellency believed them and revoked my arrangements. I had therefore to submit to His Excellency’s will. The said head ta’abs returned to Eao. But only about 200 ta’abs out of nearly 1000 signed the contracts for 56%. Nevertheless, seme of these refused to deliver either the whole or part of the quantity guaranteed, for the recovery of which I had after wards to apply to the court. DIFFICULTIES . When my above plans were upset the ring leader and his companions became very furious, and resolved to carry out the battle at all costs, and being encouraged, chiefly by * * Abdulin Faleh As Sa’a&amp;oon’s*sons and also by certain other persons Beg and others who it is police not to mention, they set to work. At this time the Shaikh’s local headmen of Faddagliyeh and Mutawa properties with some of their followers joined, # # Jassim allfirst secretly and then openly with the above ring leader Awa land by the date season of 1934 aH the Ta’abs at Fao and Fallahins at Faddaghiyeh revolted openly. ACTION In view of the foregoing it seemed imperative to and decisive action take strong/and even though such an action would call forthe sacrificing of the whole produce of one season, otherwise there would be no end to all such troubles, were it necessary to depend solely and always on the locals drain istrative authorities who (although not without repeated petitions helped sometimes, and to ^ certain extent) did not seem very pleased with the job. I therefore decided to carry out the following plans:- (1) I appointed one Yusuf A1 f Ali (a strong and energetic ex-servant of Shaikh Khazal) as my representa tive for the time being at Fao. Another ex-police corporal as an assistant representative at Faddaghiyeh, and one of my own ex—servants as an assistant representative at Mutawa. Keshaishiya and ^arhaniya being two insignificant plots I attached them to Faddaghiyeh as they are situated in the neighbourhood thereof. (2) 1 sent out sixty watchmen to Faddaghiyeh and about five hundred others to Fao, with three motor launches to guard against danger of the FaUah f s selling the produce by land and by sea, and by this means the Ta f ab and Fallahins were prevented from tampering with the produce in any manner whatsoever. (4) I filed fifty three cases for 1he recovery of arrears, against tbs most troublesome of the ta’abs basing my claim on the documents taken from them the previous year, and I secured orders for provisional attachment, before judgement, of their respective shares in Idle present crop (1934). Some of these men were from those who had guaranteed last year to deliver 56$. BEgEJLTS. The watchmai at Fao continued at their posts for nearly three months, and when the ta’abs to their great astonishmait and regret found out that their Instigators were absolute ’’liars', and that others had deceived them in telling them that H.K. had rebuked me for my actions6 and for involving liim into a heavy expenditure, and that I had been bidden by H.E. to withdraw the guards both by land and sea*, they surrendered; but I declined to accept their submission unless (1) they delivered 56^ of the produce as H*E*s permanent rightful stare, and (S) they signed and registered with the Notary Public the Ta’aba (a contract whereby the ta*ab admits the ownership of H.E. and defines himself a ta’ab under certain conditions). RESISTI&amp;TION OF CONTRACTS. MUTAWA f A - Contracts have been completed and they are now in my safe. FADDAGHIYSH - are being registered and I hope to complete same very soon. FAQ - nearly half is in the course of registra tion, the rest are refusing to sign, but I am confident that they will sooner or later have to sign. PROMISE FOR LOAN. - Faliaheen as promised were given a loan of Rs. 2000/- immediately after complet ing their contracts before the Notary Public. - Fellahen will be given as promised about Rs. 6000/- immediately after their res pective admission of their contracts. - Failaheen have been promised a loan of j about Rs. 15000/- which will be given to them when all their respective contracts are completed with the Notary Public. COMMENTS . Usually every land owner who is in a position to prove his title to the land by Tapu Deed feoi has, according to law, to apply to the Court for an order of ejectment of his Ta’ab, provided he pays him the value of his labour and plantations, that may be assessed by a commission appointed by order of the Court. The minimum of such value- i tion is ten annas per palm tree. There are over 300,000/- piam trees at Fao alone the value of which would approximately come to Rs. 200,000/- but without title of ownership it is almost impossible to MUTA&amp;A’A FADDAG-HIYEH FAOclaim ejectment . Further the Government Administrative authorities, strictly speaking, are precluded by law from ejecting anyone who may rightly or wrongly be in possession of a landed property. TEE BM.SfITS OF CONTRACTS . The benefit of the registered contracts executed by the Fallaheens and/or the Ta f abs are:- (1) The establishment of legal title of ownership. (2) The defining of rights of ownership. (3) The prevention of disturbances affecting the rights of ownership. (4) The right to claim ejectmsit. (5) The non necessity for applying to the Government Administrative authorities for help. In as much as experience has proved beyond a shadow of doubt (^^-'thatVthe less one seeks Government’s help the better and safer it is. THE BENEFITS OF LOANS . Perhaps I might have displeased H.E. by my continual recommendations and request to increase the volume of loans to the ta’abs. The Ta?abs at Fao alone have been in debt to H.E up to date for about Rs. 30,000/- including arrears pt last gear’s crop. I have now promised to make to them a further loan of Rs. 15,000/- this year (excluding Rs.5000 worth of arrears of this year’s crop). So the aggregate amounts due by them will be about Hs. 50,000/—. This figure will never be increased in future, and I propose not to worry about its collection in this, and pefchaps in the next five years. The reason is obvious, seeing that any ta’ab who might be tempted to renew the past troubles will immediately be attached with a law suit for the recovery of the money due from him end his ta’aba (land) will consequently be attached and sold by auction, when I will step in to purchase same for and in the name of H.E. for one fourth of its real value, in satisfaction of the decretal amount, whereupon thexlacfc ta’ab will be ejected- 8 - by the execution department without further independent legal action, for his ejectment. ORGANIZATION . There is hardly need to describe the state of affairs when I took over the charge from the previous agent {Abdul Aziz as Salim). In one word there was nothing at all to take charge of, no accounts and no rent agreements, even for Basrah city properties, so that I could not even claim the evacuation of any building occupied any tenant. Today everything has been organized by me and no tenant can withhold H.E’s rights. There are in my office now about 1000 files ten registeres and account books, and other printed forms, receipts etc; all in connection with H.E’s Ta f abs, Fellaheen, tenants and other various subjects. CULTIVATION . Owing to the continuous disturbances and also the negligence of the last few years the date gardens have now decayed very badly; furthermore the ta’abs have been even permitted to build shops and houses, leasing them for their aHXii sole benefit and in their own name, as though they are themselves the rightful owners of the land. Effective steps are now being taken (1) to prevent the ta’abs from erecting buildings on H.E. the Shaikh’s lands, (2) calling upon those who have previously built to execute an agreement of lease, (3) erecting new suitable buildings in the name of and am behalf of H.E. and advertising same for a very low ^ rent with a view of entiwing the occupants of the shops ^ and houses, built previously by ta ? abs, to leave them and occupy those newly built by me, so that the ta’abs build ings may ultimately become useless and lastly (4) culti vating the gardens and preparing same for new plantations. PRODUCE . EAO - For years past has not yielded more than ten thousand maunds yearly, as His Excellency s share. This year the actual yield received as His Excellency’s share was about 20,000/-^ maunds, excluding the arrears of some 3000/- Monds.OTTAWA’A — Yielded lOOOmaonds more than the pro- dice of many years past. The actual previous yield has not been much more than 4000 maunds yearly. This year there were about 5000 maunds. FiiDDAGHrX'SH - This year the crop was damaged by the disease called ”A1 Humera” and there fore there was a natural shortage - yet even so there was about 10^ excess in comparison to the neighbouring estates. Year by year the produce will be increased, and I can confidently assert that at the end of the next five years the produce may be double of what it is this year. CONCLUSION. Before concluding I wish to express my sincerest thanks to His Excellency who having encouraged me by placing his valuable confidence in me and by investing his full authority in myxfesxd me has placed me in a position whereby I could go ahead and spend as much money as I may have thought necessary for:- (1) Safeguarding his interests. (2) Bringing the disturbers of his rights to their sense, and (3) Organizing the management and administration on a legal basis. SALARY . My office staff etc. costs me about Rs. 4000 yearly and -therefore there is hardly need to say that equity and justice alone may encourage mefto JDKHpxmpxayxBsfttBB ask for a very substantial salary to enable me to keep up my office staff and continue to carry out my responsible task as satisfactorily, in every respect , as may be exposed of me.cmfmmwiAL Hc.C~244* • 3 - FOLiTicii j&amp;mcr KWAIT. 1st Au^ist 1955.

I have the honour to enclose translation of a letter $0.11-4/2117, dated 26th July 1954, which I have received from the Deputy Ruler of Kuwait inclading enclosures as under:- A^l ,A r s ? l ’ s *A ,f Letter Lo.Ril, dated 25rd July 1935 tvmi Mr. J. Gabriel, Pleader, Basra to the shaikh of Kuwait. f B * Letter Ho.7551 dated SKiid July 1935 frcm the Mutasarrif. Basra to Mr.Gabriel. «0 W Letter Bo.7552, dated 22nd July 1935 from the Mutasarrif, Basra, to respectively Mr.Gabriel and K. B.Mirza moharned t Agent for H.K.ahaikh Khazaal Khan. From the above you will see that neither Mr. G&amp;brisl nor H.fi. the shaikh knows whet exactly the Mutasarrif of Basra is driving at, or what he means when he says that the enormous ®\m of I.D.7250.737 is due frcm the shaikh of Kuwait on account of M Land Taxes ,f and 'Badal Jareeb rt of hi© date gardens situate in the Fao Mahiym. Bor is it made clear for i&amp;xat period these supposed Taxes are due, and whether they were incurred during Turkish times, the British Occupation, or after the present Arab G-overnmsrtt come into power. 3* As far as I can make out, but this must be taken as pure conjecture at present, the bill I *1).7250.737 would seem to represent an attempt to extract i ro®. the Shaikh, the value of certain n Shawati t? or silt areas, which have been recovered from the river by the Shaikh 9 *- 2 - / / Shaikh’s Fao fellaheen, and which by Turkish Law had to be p\irchased (in practice this was scarcely ever done) by the owner of the property, which benefited* The transaction was known as 'Badal Mithal 1 * - and the figpre supposed to be paid per Jareeb (Acre) was Bs.IGG/- or thereabouts* Government were them supposed to give the garden owner a special Tapu deed for the new bit of land so acquired. 5. If this is what the Mutasarrif is after, then the Shaikh would appear to have every right to resist the demand for the following reasons:- (a) Silt Land acquired from the river is recovered very slowly indeed, and it would be quite impossible for the Shaikh to have recovered some 1000 acres (which the value of the demand presupposes that he has) unless the Mutasarrif is basing his calculations on something recovered in far off Turkish tiroes, and dating over a period of anything up to a 100 years. (b) The Shaikh has never been warned, that Government 'assessors” « were at work, or intended measuring up land considered to have been gained fran the river - nor does his agent appear to have been told anything about it at all. (c) Presumably the Iraq Government has the right to take n Badal Mithal' in cases affecting the Shaikh’s 'exempt' gardens, only frcm the date on which she became an independent nation, and not for any period of the British Occupation, or when Turkey was the paramount power (i.e* prior to 1914). (d) There is no attempt to show how the Mutasarrif’s figures have been arrived at. (e) No mention is made of the position or size of the supposed measured 'Shawatis'. 6./6• I should say hazarding a guasa, and from the vary largo &amp;ai&amp; iirvolvod, '\Tiz l.D.7^50,7^7, that saaeuhing of the following actually happendd. The Mutasarrif or dared the Mudir of fac l^ahiya to secretly measure up those river-side strips of the shaikhs ?ao gardens which he thou/lit looked like laud recovered frcm the river quite irrc^gpective of when it was so recoverod , and submit the value of them at the rate laid down by Turkish Law, namely the equivalent of Rs.lQO/- per Jareeb. This naturally vfould result in a monstrous injustice. 7. One thing is as certain as the light of day, it would be physically impossible for land to the value of I.D.7250.737 to have been recovered by the Shaikh’s Fellaheen in the short period during which the Iraq Groveminent has had its independence. 8. I greatly fear that, we have here another attempt on the part of the Iraq to get at the Shaikh, end I should not be at all surprised if there was a connection between H.E.Huri Pashas visit to Basra in the latter half of July 1935 with the Mutasarrif’s present demand. The latter’s demand it will be noticed is dated the 2^nd siuly 1935. 9. Whether however Nuri Pasha be involved or not, this fresh attempt to ’get at*’ the Lhaikh during his absence in Singland, shows up none too well, in the light of Mr. Hen del’s nove of Huh Juno 19 35 on the talk he had with Nuri P&amp;sha in London recently, copy of which was forwarded to me under your Printed Letter No.478-3, dated Bushire the 8th July 193b. 10. Whether I am right or wrong in assuming that '’Shuwati” lands are referred to the matter und x discussion, I nevertheless hold strongly to the opinion that until the Iraq Government have officially validated the shaikh’s title to his five ”exesn.pt” properties and issued him with brand new Tapu Documents, they should postpone all attempts to recover the value of land recovered from the river by ”Badal Mithal” method - And even then the work will have tohave to be most carefully done, to prevent land recovered, prior to the advent of the Arab Govexiunent being included. In the present instance the Mutasarrif would appear to be trying to extract money from the ghaikh for land recovered on the riverside of the Fao Estates which are not wen held under Tapu. 11. In the meantime and in answer to tbs Shaikh of Kuwait f s letter to me under reference, I have verbally told him to wx^ite, and instruct Mr.Gabriel to address the Mutasarrif officially and find out exactly what the meaning of this latest demand is. Further I have told the shaikh that on no account should he let his lawyer pay anything, so long as the whole question of 'title” of the al -Jubah date gardens is being fought out by His Majesty’s Government.

You will kindly note that the said Mutasarrif is asking for something he calls 'the remains of land Taxes', and 'Badal Jareeb'.

The Mutasarrif does, it i-fes true add that item (a) is still the subject of correspondence with the Ministry of Finance, 4. In other words this so called new claim of the Iraq Government against the Shaikh has risen from I.D,7250.737 in July last to I.D. 18678.527 on 1st October 1955 - a rather strange disparity of figures, to say the least of it. 5. One almost despairs of ever being able to arrive at any settlement at all in this vexed question of the Date Gardens, if these are the sort of claims, the Shaikh is going to be faced with. 6. In the meantime I still adhere to the view expressed in para 5 of my Confidential Letter No.C-244 of 1st August (referred to at the beginning of this letter) and cannot but advise the Shaikh to resist strongly the Mutasarrif’s demand, and for the reasons given in that letter. 7 . it my interest you to Imow that so dissatisfied is the Shaikh with the progress of his garden affairs generally, and especially with the reprehensible methods of Mr.Gabriel, his Pleader and Agent in Basra, who be now openly accuses of 'running with the hare and hunting with the hounds', and also of intriguing with the fellaheen against his own son Shaikh Mohamed who for some weeks past and by his orders, has been living on the Fao Estates, trying to bring about a better understanding between landlord and fellah; that he (the Shaikh) has cancelled the general r'ower of Attorney given to that individual, and has issued a fresh, and similar Power of Attorney to his son Mohamed giving him full powers to manage his Iraq Estates.8 In tiie above connection please see separate letter.

Compensation for losses incurred by tRe shaikh of Kuwait as a result of the introduction by the Iraq Government of Is table Jc Tax. Reference British ,inh&amp;say , Baghdad letter to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No.498, dated 17th Sept emb er 19 25 • As His Majesty’s Government will no doubt shortly be considering the question of the shaikh’s cXatos for compensation for losses incurred by him, as a result of the introduction of Istahlak Tax, whether these be direct or indirect, I venture respectfully to suggest that the best way to arrive at a fair and equitable decision as regards the admissibility of the Shaikh's ciaims, will be to refer the matter to a group of disinterested persons, preferably Law Officers. In referring the matter to them, the latter could be asked to examine the *hole correspondence from the beginning and give their considered decision as to what in fairness should be paid to the Shaikh and what should not. My reason for making the above suggestion is that in this question of the Shaikh’s claims for compensation, the matter is clearly one between the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government, and the former is trying to get something out of the latter which hehe considers is due to him by right. His Majesty’s Government as well as ourselves (H.M’s .ambassador, yourself and myself) cannot, I think, be considered as entirely free from bias since we cannot but have at the back of our minds the interest of the British Taxpayer. This is not unnatural. Hence and in order that the Shaikh may get a perfectly fair deal, and have no excuse later to coBiplain that judgement in the form of a decision was given against him by the very party against whom he was striving to get compensation, I suggest that a perfectly neutral body be summoned to decide the matter. If this is done the dhaikh, I am sure, will be fully satisfied whatever be the nature of the ”award* of such a parson or persons. 4. As regards the advisability of such a step on grounds of policy, my views are as given in paras 6 and 7 of my despatch No.C-242, dated the 29th July 1935, forwarding statements of losses for 1934, and at so many previous occasions. iV&gt;^ 5 , In conclusion 1 trust that you will examine my suggestion favourably, and if you see no objection, will pass it on to His Majesty’s Govermaesnt for their consideration. X should like to add here that if we failed to take this step of our own accord, the Ohaikh is sure later to turn round and say that His Majesty’s Government’s decision was far froa being a fair one, and he for ever afterwards will have a grievance. gd»—H.H.P.Di ck-son, i'* Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, KuwaitCONFIDENTIAL.

Il-OSASUHI CHAMBSHS, U ill X iJ-iJj J S • v i * 1 * 17til January, 1936. dear Bermett, Please refer to the recent correspondence about the question of compensating the Sheikh of Kuweit for the taxation of the produce of his date gardens, then we consider the Ambassador 1 s proposal for dealing with the possession difficulty, we shall have also to consider how much longer we can defer compensation in respect of taxation. If such compensation can be paid in a lump sum, which we should strongly favour, financial considerations point to an early settlement, since we shall presumably have to compensate for taxation losses already sustained in addition to compounding for the future at X years 1 purchase, and X will not diminish through delay. Thus the longer we wait, the more it will probably cost. On looking at the question, nowever, one possible difficulty in the way of lump sum compensation occurs to us. We promised the late Sheikh that the gardens would terndale Bennett, JSsq., C.M.G*, Foreign Office, S a i&gt; • a .remain in his possession and in possession of his descendants without being subject to the payment of taxes or imposts. The present Sheikh, who I believe is third in succession from the Sheikh to whom the pledge was given, is regarded as having a right to compensation now that he has been taxed. The point that troubles us is whether, if we compound with him in perpetuity for a lump sum, he can give us a good discharge binding on his successors. We should -want to be sure that if he accepted, say, f 10,000 in final settlement and then spent this money on himself, we should be in a position to turn a deaf ear to his successor who would continue to suffer from the Istihiak tax without having derived any benefit from the £ 10 , 000 . There is also the contingency that the weight of taxation may rise. If there is any question as to whether the sheikh can give us a good discharge on behalf of his successors, we shall have to consider whether the difficulty can be surmounted by some form of trust deed. This might not be easy, but an arrangement involving an annual vote for ever and ever seems impossible to contemplate. There hasbeen a good deal of discussion of the form, in which compensation is to be given - see especially3 Laitiiwaite 1 s letter of the 26th October, 1933, to Helm - but I cannot trace that the particular point I have now raised has ever been considered. If it has not, the question will, we think, have to be put to the lawyers, and this mijht as well be done at once as nothing can very well happen now to affect their answer. i am sending a copy of this letter to Clausen at the India office. fours sincerely, {21). } a.&gt;%;■ j iUd: 1123/36.

We agree that when we discuss the Ambassador*s proposal for dealing with the possession difficulty, we shall also have to consider the question of compensating the Shaikh for his taxation losses. If you and India Office can then suggest some way of settling the compensation question independently of any settlement of the possession difficulty, we see- no reason why we should raise objection. 3. Beckett has Icoled into the specific point you raise about possible claims from the Shaikh’s successors in connexion with the possibility of lump sum compensation* He considers that the point presents no real difficulty. If a promise to Ruler A to do something for him and his successors is an undertaking upon which his successor G can rely', it is equally the case that if Ruler G releases the undertaking for himself and his successors, the successors of C will be bound by what G has done. If,, for example, the present Shaikh of Kuwait were to cede some of his territory, his son, when he succeeded to the throne of Kuwait, could not claim it back again; similarly if the present Shaikh agreed to accept a lump sum payment in final settlement of all claims which he and his heirs might have on His Majesty’s Govern ment in respect of their taxation losses, his successors would have no further claim to compensation from us. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gleuson. Yours sincerely, sd. G .W.Rend el. E.Hale Esq.1363/36. In closure in Treasury covering letter Bo.3.32453/12, dated 24th February, 1936. 3.32453/12. °4th February, 1936. Bear Rend el, j~ : ~ ^ ^ ^ Thank: you for your letter of the 13th February U 327/ 18/93), on the subject of the Sheikh of Koweit* s date gardens. 2. Constitutionally, I think that any proposal to settle the compensation question without awaiting a comprehensive settlement of the possession question should come to us from the Foreign Office, as the expenditure involved would be a charge on the Diplomatic and Consular Vote. This, however, need not prevent me from explaining why we think th-t the question of compensation should not await a comprehensive settlement of the possession question or from making a suggestion as to how to go about matter. J F ' F/r m ! told the 3. In his note of the 28th Jaruar [umphrys Iraqi Government that if they would give the Sheikh a good title to the Faddaghiyah Gardens {less the Bashiyah section) l we would contribute up to £2,000 to expenses; and that provided th^t full effect was given to this arrangement, and provided further that the Iraqi Government would (a) claim no arrears from either ^heikh, and (b) give a written assurance thnt no discriminatory taxation would be imposed on either Sheikh in future, we would raise no further claim for exemption 4. W© have a very definite impression that, while the Iraqi Government may in practice be prepared to protect the Sheikhs in possession of their property, e.g. by putting spokes in/ .W. Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office.in the wheels of inconvenient litigants, they have not the slightest intention of taking any overt action that might b© politically embarrassing to them. If therefore we are to wait for a comprehensive settlement, all open and above board, it looks as if we shall wait indefinitely. If it were possible to keep the Sheikh of Koweit waiting indefinitely for his money, we should hare nothing to sey; but assuming that sooner or Inter we shall have to pay him, whether the possession difficulty has been tidied up or not, we had better pay him sooner, for the reason mentioned in my letter of the 17th January. 5. Clearly we cannot pay him without getting from the Iraqis a formal assurance with regard to provisos (a) and (b) referred to above. We think, however, that the Iraqis might be willing to give assurances on these points, since to do so would not involve any overt action that might be mad© the subject of criticism in Iraq. The suggestion we put forward is therefore that the Ambassador might again approach the Iraqi Government on the following lines. ,L ^/ / tj.ft* rft ■ s t sX*. 6. Referring to the note of the 28th January, he might say that it is now evident that a final sdntlon of the possession question cannot be looked for at an early date. Since the Sheikhs remain in effective possession of their gardens, (apart from the Bashiyah section} and since we know that we can rely on the promise made by King Fe1 sal and solemnly renewed by King Gha&amp;i, delay does not in practice involve any grave consequences so far as possession is concerned. On the other hand, settlement o i the taxation question does not brook delay, as the Sheikhs are paying annually considerable sums in taxation from which they have been promised exemption. His Majesty 1 a Oovarirr-enl * re prepared to settle this question, but before doing so they mu~t have formal assurances on points (a) and (b). If they can/can receive such assurances, they for their part will /S4* undertake to raise no further claim for exemption from taxation. (The actual drafting would of course need fuller consideration: I have not attempted to do more than indicate the line of argument). 7. As regards the form of ccmpensation, we should be strongly in favour of settling the Sheikh of Koweit* a claim once and for all by a lump sum payment» in return for which we should expect a formal discharge binding on hie successors! as well as upon himself, Fe do not find it easy to express an opinion as to the lowest amount that would be accepted in final settlement, and we should like to hear the views of those on the spot as to the figure to be offered in the first place. Ho doubt there will have to be bargaining. 8. I am sending a copy of this letter to Clauson at the India Office. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) 3.Hale.ileceived under I.O.F.L.

It seems to us, meanwhile, that the most urgent matter is to take the necessary action for a settlement of the question of the Xhaikhfs compensation for the loss of his exemption from taxation and that the best method of approaching this question iX’ the one suggested by / Hale in his letter to you of 24th February 1936 . .7e agree with him as to the desirability of separating the compensation question from the possession question and of settling the former as soon as possible. If we could obtain assurances from the Iraq Government not to claim arrears of taxes from the -haikh and not to impose discriminatory taxation upon him, and if we then proceed to honour our financial obligations by refunding to the 3ha ikh the equivalent of what he was already paid in taxation and by making a lump sum payment as a financial discharge of the promised exemption from taxation, we should at any rate have accomplished a good deal, and should have disposed of the most urgent aspect of the whole matter. »e coulci then car sue with the Iraqi Government a settlement of the question of the 3 haikh f s possession, pending which we might be able to regard with comparative equanimity a continuance of the present status quo in regard to the possession aspect, hich, as Hale points out , is not so urgent so long as the oh a ikh remains, u in defact o x )0f: ’ sess i oli -* ^ ^ You may be proposing to call an interdepa rtmental meeting soon to consider Hale’s suggestions: if so we shall be glad to attend. Meanwhile we think it would be- 2 - ■'' / | \ would be well to consult Fowle, and ii you see no objection I propose to telegraph to him personally on the lines of the enclosed draft. 5. '/hen we come to discuss figures, we ought perhaps to take some account also of the case of the shaikh of Mohammerah, who has bean out of the. picture lately. I see it was suggested in Baghdad despatch No.390 of the 12th July 19 34, that he should get half what the shaikh of Kuwait gets in the way of compensation. But the argent matter seems to be to settle the question of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s compensation (as I suppose it is doubtful whether there are in any case practicable means of enabling the shaikh of Mohammerah to enjoy the income of his property or the benefit of any compensation?). 6 .

But you will realise that from our point of view the danger is that there are few secrets in this part of the world and that once the Iraqi Government came to know that the Shaikhs had been paid compensation for their losses under the istihla q tax, any idea of a comprom se settlement of all the question relating to the Shaikhs * date gardens would lose for them what little attracriveness it might have had. 3. In this connection I think you should know that there has appeared recently in the local press, both in bagdad and at Basra, a series of articles drawing attention to the fact that a sum of about I.D# 30,000 remains out standing {^gainst the Shaikjs in respect of taxation on their properties for the yeats 1928-1931 and suggesting that the government intend shortly to take steps to collect this amount. You know too much about our local papers to take this sort of thing too seriously, but the appearance of these articles does show that the possibility of claiming arrears o I fully understand the opinion of Fowle andarrears of taxation has not been entirely lost sight of here. 4 .

After Compliments, I have with pleasure received your letter No.C-156, dated the 16th Safar 1355 (7.5.36), and have understood its contents in connection with the amount of tithes paid on the produce of our properties for the year 1935. Statements showing the said tithes will be forwarded to you in the same way as we did in the case of those relating to the produces of the past years, viz- 1932, 19 33 and 1934. But we regret to say that we have heard nothing as yet, about the recovery of the amounts paid as tithes during the abov©mentioned years, and the heavy expenses sustained by us on that account; and in consequence intrigues have played their parts in our properties which have became liable to ruin because of the rebellions of the fellaht;en. You must have seen the previous ocwmuiiication with your predecessors in this connection. In fact the application of the tithe ^rstem of taxation to our properties has caused us to sustain great losses in several ways:- First - It gave an opportunity to the fellaheen and encouraged those Insurgents of them to neglect -dieir duties and insist on their intrigues and seditions, and provided a wide field to those Impelled by motives, until the expenses we s.pent equalled or probably exceeded the income of the properties. secondly - In spite of our efforts to deal with the situation in the easiest way possible, matters have gone from had to worse, and we need not assure you that we are suffering the worst on account of the state of unrest now prevailing in our properties, whidx has become jp r,f +.be neople and newspapers.-E ~ Thirdly - We firmly believe that all these - fallacies and argumentations arise of nothing but jealousy felt towards us, because we Mve taken refuge under the shadow of H*M# f s Government, placing our confidence in their ds justice and relying on their sympathy wi th their loyal frien •/e presume that His I/iajesty’s Government and its honest men are aware of the maltreatment which we meet with patience, placing our confidence in the British Justice; and that the promises given us and our ancestors will not be enfeebled under the shadow of His Majesty* s Government’s protection, seeing that we adhere to them and their solemn Pledge to us both tt inwriting and in words’*• For all these reasons and their fallacies I request ‘that our violated rights be restored as also the tithes levied for the past years and the expenses incurred by us on that account, and that matters be reinstated as they had been before the application of the tithes system of taxation to our properties which were excepted by His M&amp;jesty’s Gov ernment * 3 Pie dge • In th is conne cti on we shoold like to draw your attention to the suppositions and false ^ rumours which are published in the newspapers about us and our properties, and which meet with encouragement in Iraq, while we always try to avoid whatever may give displeasure, being anxious to maintain Hie privileges of neighbourhood and to strengthen the bonds of friendship and brotherhood with our neighbours# In conclusion we request you -t kindly to submit what we have stated above to His Majesty’s Government in whose justice and goodwill we place all our confidence.

Dear Clausen, I enclose a copy of a self-explanatory letter to Hale, together with its two enclosures. You will see that the Intervention of Sir Arnold Wilson on hehalf of the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah has Drought to a head the question of future procedure in dealing with the question of compensation, for tax losses. As t his concerns the Sheikh of Kuweit equally with the Sheikh of Mo hammer ah we shall he grateful, to learn as soon as possible whether the India Office concur generally in our attitude and if so whether you agree with the terms of the relevant section of the draft reply to Sir Arnold Wilson. Tours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. G. Ward. Clauson, EsqZ. 1843/57. 3.1303/53/93)- roortant and Immediate . FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.W. 1. . &gt;v 18th March, 1937. / x / / Dear Hale, Following on our telephone conversation yesterday I send you herewith a copy of Sir Arnold Wilson's further letter to Lord Cranborne of the 28th February together with the draft reply which we suggest should be sent to him. The draft is not being submitted to higher authority here until we know whether you feel able to concur in it. 2. You will remember that the Sheikh of Mohammerah died when we were on the point of sending to Bagdad instructions for a new comprehensive settlement (Foreign Office despatch to Bagdad No. 359 of the 2nd June, 1936) and that we recorded in the last paragraph of that despatch that it would be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to examine how-far the assurances given to Sheikh Khazal in 1914 might be held binding in respect of his heirs. We subsequently went into matters very fully here and as a result we arrived at the conclusion that the first step must be to obtain more information about the heirs and the various technical questions connected with the inheritance to the Iraqi properties. We accordingly made the necessary enquiries of Bagdad and Tehran in despatches of the 7th October (copies of which were sent to you under our number E 6326/18/93 on the 9th October). We received replies to these despatches early this year (copies of which went to/ 8 i l ; i Hale, Esq.2. to you under our number E 215 / 53/ 93 of the 29th January) and when Sir Arnold Wilson’s further letter reached the Eastern Department we had just finished reconsidering the whole matter and were about to approach you again on the subject. 3. The position now is that we must return an early reply to Sir Arnold Wilson, but that at the same time we feel that it is essential to tell him something definite about the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the heirs and also to give him some idea of the procedure which we contemplate in the future. The enclosed draft shows the conclusions which the Eastern Department have provisionally reached in both these respects and you will see that we have at the same time included in the draft certain additional general explanations. 4. When we sent the despatches of enquiry to Bagdad and Tehran last October we were already under the impression that it would be extremely difficult to maintain that the obligation assumed vis-a-vis the Sheikh of Mohammerah in respect of his Iraqi date gardens was not legally binding, in respect of his heirs, who are explicitly mentioned in the original promise. It has been suggested in the past that as the 1914 promise was made to the Sheikh when he was in a special and semi-independent feudal position in Persia it might be considered to lap^e in respect of his heirs when that position was lost. ILis thesis seems to us very dubious, particularly in the light of correspondence between the Foreign Office and Sir/J Sir Percy Cox in 1927 which made it clear that the promise given in respect of Sheikh Khasal’s Iraqi date gardens was considered at the time it was given to he an unconditional obligation, independent of the promises also made in respect of the Sheikh’s position in Persia. At the same time we did feel that it might he extremely difficult, if not almost impossible, in practice to carry out the promise towards the Sheikh’s heirs, and for this reason we withheld any definite conclusion until we had obtained more detailed information from Bagdad and Tehran. 5. The replies, and in particular the despatch from Bagdad, show in our view that the administrative difficulties which we originally anticipated in dealing with the heirs need not materialise, and that provided the family estates in Iraq are maintained as an entity in the form of a family trust under the administration of an authorised agent (at any rate until such time as we have effected a final settlement relieving us of our obligations) there should be no more difficulty in paying compensation, and if necessary, in defending the title to the properties against the Iraqi Government, than in the case of the estates of the Sheikh of Koweit. The replies have also convinced us that however desirable in theory, it would in practice be impossible to discriminate between the 29 heirs, (male and female) on grounds of merit, and that there would, therefore, be no objection this score to paying any compensation into a family trust. We feel, however, that we must make the maintenance of conditions ensuring that the estate can be dealt with as a whole through a single agent an absolute condition of payment of compensation, and that we/4. i?*h. a * wg should in no c i pc urns! sine gs 'b© dpnwn into d© 3.1 inn with individual heirs. When we have disposed of the reply to Sir Arnold Wilson, we propose therefore to take up the suggestion in paragraph 8 of Bagdad despatch No. 612 that the heirs should he informed that they must agree to a family trust if they expect to receive any compensation from His Majesty’s Government. (The question of what our attitude would he if one or more of the heirs refused to come into a family trust and insisted on having his or their share of the property made over individually had, I think, better he left until it arises, since it is not clear whether in such circumstances it would still he possible for the rest of the heirs to incorporate the remainder of the property in a trust). 6 . As regards the question of future procedure, you will see that we have thought it necessary to mention in the draft to Sir Arnold Wilson that if the possibility of a comprehensive settlement covering both the ’’possession” and ’’taxation” issues continues to be remote, we may be ready to pursue the question of tax losses independently, subject, however, to our obtaining the necessary assurances from the Iraqi Government not. .tx&gt; collect the arrears of direct taxation and not to.levy discriminatory taxation in the future. You will remember that we had some discussion on this point at the interdepartmental meeting on the 15th May, 1936 ( a copy of the final record of which went to you on the 10th June, 1936). I see from page 9 of the record that you then stated that the Treasury would be prepared to consider a separate settlement of the compensation aspect if necessary, and it looks as though/though this may turn out to “be the best course. It will presumably be cheaper not to wait longer than necessary, and there would, of course, be political value in settling the taxation side of the promise, particularly in view of the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit (see Clauson ? s remarks on pages 7 and 8 of the same record). The present position is that we have instructed the Ambassador at Bagdad to urge our comprehensive proposals on the new Government (Foreign Office telegram ho. 16 of the 15th January to Bagdad a copy of which went to you under our number E 7797/18/93). When we learn the reaction of the Iraqis we shall be in a position to decide whether or not to go ahead with the idea of an independent settlement for the taxation aspect. 7. We should be very grateful to learn as soon as possible whether you share our view about the attitude which His Majesty’s Government should adopt towards the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and about future procedure and, if so, whether you agree in the terms of the draft letter to Sir Arnold Wilson ( who, as I have said, should be given a reply as soon as possible ). 8 . The India Office are not directly interested in the question of the estates of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, but they are directly concerned in the question of future procedure, since it will obviously be necessary to treat the Sheikh of Koweit and the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah on an exactly equal footing. I am therefore sending a copy of this letter to Clauson and asking him whether the India Office feel able to agree with the policy proposed. Yours sincerely, Sgd. J. G. Ward.E. 1308 / 53/93 March, 7, 1937. J.G.W. Personal and confidential. Wilson, M . P • In accordance with the promise in my letter Lord Ore anborn^of March 3, I write to let yon know the present position about the question of compensation for the loss of income from the date gardens in Iraq belonging to the late Sheikh of Mohammerah •easury Office ‘pence arising from the incidence of the new Iraqi 'Istihlak' tax on agricultural produce. 2* You may remember that I told you during our conversation at the Foreign Office on the 3rd December that His Majesty’s Government had always recognised the obligation incurred in respect of Sheikh Khazal’s Iraqi properties as a result of the promise given to him in November 1914, but that the position had recently been complicated by the Sheikh’s death. I explained that in the circumstances a formal decision was required by His Majesty’s Government before the promise given to Sheikh Khazal could be considered in principle as holding good in respect of his heirs. 3. Since our interviev/ we have gone carefully into the whole question in the light of further information which we have obtained about the Sheikh’s heirs and the technicalities of the inheritance. As a result I am now able to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have decided, in principle, that Sheikh Ahasal s heirs shall be treated in respect of the date gardens in Iraq no less favourably than the late Sheikh himself, provided, however, that the heirs furnish the essential degree of co operation2 . operation on their side 'by agreeing to the Iraqi properties being turned into some kind of a joint family trust under an administrator with whom His Majesty’s Government can deal direct. For obvious reasons it is essential that the Iraqi estates of the family shall not be partitioned. We could not possibly deal individually with the twenty-nine present heirs, male and female, let alone with their future heirs. Nor could we become involved with outside parties in the event of any of the heirs parting with their share or using it as security for borrowing money. 4. Now that we have recognized that the promise to Sheikh Khazal holds good in principle in respect of his heirs, we have to consider the extremely complicated question of future pro- cedure. As you are doubtless aware, the promise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah about his Iraqi estates followed immediately after a similar promise to the Sheikh of Koweit, who also possessed extensive properties in southern Iraq* The promises consist of a twofold assurance of continued undisturbed possession and oi future immunity from taxation. Unluckily no formal admission has ever been obtained from the Iiu,q- Government that they recognize that these obligations contracted by His Majesty’s Govern ment have now devolved upon themselves. Nevertheless the promises were observed in practice up to 1932, since the taxes payable under the old Turkish system of direct taxation on/ T'3 * on landed property which prevailed up to that year were not in fact levied upon the properties of the two Sheikhs, although the Iraqi Government consistently claimed that hy right these taxes should he levied and that the question of payment was merely in suspense. In 1932, however, the introduction of the present indirect 'Istihlak' tax on sales of agricultural produce in place of direct taxation made it impossible for the Sheikhs’ gardens on practical grounds alone to continue to receive exemption. At the same time it became clear that there were also risks in regard to the fulfilment of that part of the 1914 promise v/hieh related to the guarantee of possession, since the Sheikh of Koweit was divested by the Iraqi Courts of one of his estates, and various other suits, which have only been suspended with great difficulty, were brought against him in respect of other estates. 5. We have always recognised in principle that if the Iraqi Government could not he forced to assume our obligations in the matter of exemption from taxation we should have to compensate the Sheikhs for their losses, preferably in the form of a lump sum payment equivalent to so many years of annual taxation. But it was clear from the first that the only practical policy was to arrange for the compensa tion in respect of taxation to form part of a final settlement of the whole question and to be linked with assurances from the Iraqi Government that they would guarantee the Sheikhs against dispossession in the future, as well as against attempts to claim taxation for the pne-1932 period (during which, as I have explained, they enjoyed/ / I : &gt; ; i ! ■MMHaaiiienjoyed de facto exemption) or discriminatory taxation in the intnre* Otherwise there would 'be a constant risk of fresh claims for compensa tion which would create a sort of running financial embarrassment to His Majesty’s Govern ment. Moreover, if we were at this stage our selves to pay compensation direct to the heirs, we should greatly have weakened our thesis that the Iraqis have legally inherited the promises of 1914, which is at present our best lever for inducing them to co-operate in a final settle ment . 6 . Accordingly after prolonged negotiations with the Iraqi Government we put before them last summer nev/ and comprehensive proposals for a settlement of the whole problem of the date gardens. These included a scheme by which the Sheikhs would receive an unassailable legal title to their properties. They also in cluded (as I explained to you at our last meet ing) an undertaking from the Iraqi Government that no arrears of direct taxation payable before 1932 should be demanded of tbe Sheikhs and that no discriminatory taxation should be imposed on the estates in future. We had reached a stage where we had good ground for hoping that these proposals would be accepted, and the way cleared to a comprehensive settle ment of the whole problem, when the Government of Yasin Pasha was turned out of office. 7. ¥e are now trying to get the new Govern ment to fall into line. But although a comprehensive settlement of both aspects of the promise would be greatly preferable in the interests/ * m\5 . interests of all concerned it is clear that this may not be forthcoming without further delay and we are now considering the e expedient of attempt ing to settle the taxation aspect separately and in advance of the possession aspect.- But assurances from the Iraqi Government not to f claim arrears of taxation or levy discriminatory taxation in future are an essential condition even for this limited objective. B. Y/e are now doing our best to extract these assurances from the Iraqi Government. When we have obtained them we shall come up against the very difficult question of assessing the lass of revenue from the Sheikhs’ Iraqi properties through the fact that their produce has a slightly lower value owing to its having to pay the 10% 'Istihlak” tax when eventually sold in the market. ¥e began to investigate this question in detail in 1933, and the Sheikhs were asked, as a preliminary step to the consideration of ways and means of compensating them, to supply figures of the estimated losses from this tax. You will remember that in your letter to me of October 16th you enclosed copies of correspond ence on this very point between the oheikh Khaasal s agent and the Embassy at Bagdad and I should perhaps mention (for your own information) that the claims submitted by the agent are considered by expert opinion to be far too high. lor instance, the sales of dates from Sheikh Khazal’s estates are given as amounting to more than the quantity sold from the estates of the Bheikh ot Koweit, although the Sheikh of Koweit’s estates are assessed by the Iraqi revenue authorities at double/double the hearing capacity. We shall therefore have to give very close and careful attention to the detailed financial aspect of the question before fixing the amount of any compensation. 9. In the meanwhile it is important that the heirs should themselves take steps to fulfil the essential condition which I have mentioned above by retaining the family estates in Iraq as an entity under an administrator with whom we can deal on their behalf. 10. I have tried in this letter to explain the position as fully as possible and I hope that I may have convinced you that we are doing our best to dispose of a most complicated problem. I should perhaps emphasise the fact that the grievance of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to the 1914 promise only concerns the taxation aspect and even then only refers to the period after 1932 when the new indirect tax of 10% was introduced. For the whole period up to 1932 Sheikh Khazal’s uroperties in Iraq paid no taxes and his right to possession has never been challenged. 11. I should be grateful if you would treat this letter as entirely confidential. At the same time I have no objection to your informing Sheikh Khazal’s agent that in principle His Majesty’s Government have decided that the heirs shall be treated collectively no less favourably than Sheikh Khazal himself would have been treated, and that their claim to compensation for tax losses has not been overlooked. At the same time it would be well to add that it is essential that the estates in Iraq shall not be partitioned/P. 3.1843/193V India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. 19th March, 1937.

You may remember that I told you during our conversation at the Foreign Office on the 3rd December that His Majesty’s Government had always recognised the obligation incurred in respect of Shaikh Fhazal’s Iraqi properties as a result of the promise given to him in November 1914, but that the position had recently been complicated by the Shaikh’s death, and that before a formal decision could be taken as to the recognition of the claims of the heirs, it would be necessary to obtain and consider the facts relating to the Shaikh’s estate. As you know, there are twenty-eight heirs, male and female, each of whom may in turn have numerous heirs, and you will therefore x am sure appreciate the need for careful consideration. 3, Since our interview we have gone carefully into the whole question in the light of further information which we have obtained about the Shaikh’s heirs and the technicalities of the inheritance. As a result I am now able to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have decided, in principle, that Shaikh Khazal’s heirs shall be treated in respect of the date gardens in/ eutenant-Colonel Sir Arnold Wilson, K.C.I.E., G.S.I., M.P.in Iraq no less favourably than the late Shaikh himself, pro vided, however, that the heirs furnish the essential degree Of co-operation on their side by agreeing to the Iraqi properties being turned into some kind of a joint family trust undeir an administrator with whom His Majesty’s Government can deal direct. 4* Your letter of the 5th April suggests that the division of the Shaikh , s estates in Iraq among the heirs is inevitable. Hie information available to us on the legal position suggests on the contrary that the question whether or not the estates are divided depends on the wishes of the heirs themselves, the provisions of Mohammedan law being apparently equally applic able to the division among the heirs of the revenues from the estates as a whole, and to the actual division among the heirs of the estates themselves. it appears that the heirs would receiv financially much more from their inheritance if they did not divide up the estates since in order to exploit them most pro fitably it is essential that they should be administered as an entity by a reliable agent empowered to arrange to best advantage the packing and sale of the date crop. ihis could apparently be done by making the estates into a * , waqf% which would in this case amount to a family trust. At the same time it appears that owing to jealousies among the heirs there is a grave risk that certain of them may press for partition. 5. You will I am sure realise why it is essential from the point of view of His Majesty^ Government that the Iraqi estates of the family should not be partitioned. We could not possibly deal individually with the twenty-eight present heirs, male and female, let alone with their future heirs. M&gt;r could we become involved with outside parties in the event of any of the heirs, or their heirs, parting with their share or using it as security/security for borrowing money 6. i*ow that we have recognized that the promise to Sheikh Ehazal holds good in principle in respect of his heirs, we have to consider the extremely complicated question of future procedure. As you are doubtless aware, the promise to the Shaikh of Mohammerah about his Iraqi estates followed immed iately after a similar promise to the Shaikh of &amp;oweit, who also possessed extensive properties in southern Iraq. The promises consist of a twofold assurance of continued undisturbed poss ession and of future immunity from taxation. in the view of His Majesty*s Government these obligations have now devolved upon the Iraqi Government, but it has not been possible to obtain from the Iraqi Government any formal admission that this is so. nevertheless the promises were observed in practice up to 1932, since the taxes payable on landed property under the old 'Turkish system of direct taxation which prevailed up to that year were not in fact levied upon the properties of the two Shaikhs, although the Iraqi Government consistently claimed that by right these taxes should be levied and that the question of payment was merely in suspense. in 1932, however, the introduction of the present indirect “Istihlak’ 1 tax on sales of agricultural produce in place of the former direct taxation made it impossible for the Shaikhs* gardens, on practical grounds alone, to continue to receive exemption. At the same time it became clear that there were also risks in regard to the fulfilment of that part of the 1914 promise which related to the guarantee of possession, since the Shaikh of Koweit was divested by the Iraqi Courts of one of his es tates, and various other suits, 'which have only been suspended with great difficulty, were brought aginst him in respect of other estates. 7. We have always recognised in principle that if the Iraqi Government could not be forced to assume our obligationsin the matter of exemption from taxation we should have to compensate the Shaikhs for their losses, preferably in t he * form of a lurap sum payment equivalent to so many years of ann ual taxation. hut it was clear from the first that the only fully satisfactory policy was to arrange for the compensation in respect of taxation to form part of a final settlement of the whole question and to be linked with assurances from the Iraqi Government that they would guarantee the Shaikhs against dispossession in the future, as well as aginst attempts to claim taxation for the pre-1932 period ^during which, as I have explained, they enjoyed de facto exemption) or dis criminatory taxation in the future. Otherwise thertwould be a constant risk of fresh claims for compensation which would create a sort of running financial embarrassment to His Majesty^ Government. Moreover, if we were at this stage our selves to pay compensation direct to the heirs, we should greatly have weakened our thesis that the Iraqis have legally inherited the promises of I9i4, which is at present our best lever for inducing them to co-operate in a final settlement. 8. Accordingly after prolonged negotiations with the Iraqi Government we put before them last summer new and comprehensive proposals for a settlement of the whole problem of the date gardens. fhese included a scheme by which the Shaikhs would receive a unassailable legal title to their properties. 'fhey also included (as I explained to you at our last meeting) an undertaking from the Iraqi Government that no arrears of direct taxation payable before 1932 should be demand ed of the Shaikhs and that no discriminatory taxation should be imposed on the estates in future.

But assurances from the Iraqi Government not to claim arrears of taxation or levy discriminatory taxation in future are an essential condition even for this limited obj ec tive • 10. We are now doing our beat to extract theae aaaur- ancea from the Iraqi Government. When we have obtained them we shall come up against the very difficult question of assessing the extent of the loss in revenue from the Shaikhs* Iraqi properties caused by the fact that their produce now has a slightly lower value owing to its having to pay the 10^ 'Istihlak** tax when eventually sold in the market. We began to investigate this question in detail in 1933 , and the Shaikhs were asked, as a preliminary step to the consid eration of ways and means of compensating them, to supply figures of the estimated losses from this tax. You will remember that in your letter of the 16th October you enclosed copies of correspondence on this very point between the Shaikh Khaza^s agent and the Smbassy at Bagdad and I should perhaps mention (for your own information} that the claims submitted by the agent are considered to be far too high. For instance; the sales of dates from Shaikh Khazal’s estates are given as amounting to mere than the quantity sold from the estates of the Shaikh of Koweit, although the Shaikh of Eoweitfs estates are assessed by the Iraqi revenue authorities at double the bearing capacity. We shall therefore have to give close and careful/ 1 ^ I \\^ $ f (gs&gt;* careful attention to the detailed financial aspect of the question before fixing the araount of any compensation* 11. In the meanwhile it is important that the heirs should themselves take steps to fulfil the essential condition which I have mentioned above by retaining the family estates in Iraq as an entity under an administrator with whom we can deal on their behalf* 12. Your letter of the 5th April raised a further point by suggesting that pending a definite settlement of the in heritance the revenues from the estates are no longer being distributed among the heirs. We are not clear whether this is obligatory under the relevant local law. if so the best and quickest way out will be for the heirs to agree to the early formation of a family trust* if partition is attempted it seems clear from our information that lengthy wrangles and legal disputes will ensue among the heirs and the outside claimants * who will doubtless appear. in any event it is not clear to me why a settlement of the inheritance among the heirs need be delayed until a settlement has resulted of the claim for compensation for taxation. 13. I have tried in this letter to explain the position as fully as possible and I hope that I may have convinced you that we are doing our best to dispose of a most complicated problem. I should perhaps emphasise the fact that the grievance of the Shaikh of Mohammerah in regard to the 1914 promise only concerns the taxation aspect and even then only refers to the period after 1932 when the new indirect tax of 10% was introduced. for the whole period up to 1932 Shaikh Khazal*s properties in Iraq paid no taxes and his right to possession has never been challenged. 14 . i would ask you to treat this letter as entirely confidential.

In our view there are only two methods by which further progress can be made with the Date Gardens problem, viz:- (a) to expedite a settlement of the Saudi-Kuwait Blockade question, thus opening a way for the settlement of the Kuwait-Iraq smuggling dispute, and consequently of the Date Gardens question; (b) to leave aside for the present the proposals for securing a comprehensive settlement of the Date Gardens question and revert to the earlier j Rend el, Esq., C.M.G, foreign Office, suggestio n/3 suggestion of attempting to settle the 'taxation' aspect separately from, and in advance of, the 'possession' aspect.

In circumstances we are strongly of opinion that, without awaiting the conclusion of this triple series ox negotiations, an attempt should he made to secure a partial settlement of the Date Gardens problem on the lines suggested at (b) above; and subject to any observations which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (vno 4 . I 11 itis being consuloed) mny liav© io oifor f we suggest- txiat the Treasury .should be asked to agree to the following proposition. 4. His Majesty's Gowermnent should, now agree in principle to make a lump sum payment to the Sheikh of Koweit representing (a) the total amount of his losses since 1932 which are directly attributable to the imposition of the Istihlak tax p lus (b) an amount sufficient to compensate for his future losses, calculated with reference to his present annual average loss. In return for this lump sum payment the Sheikh should be required to give a written recognition that this payment released His Majesty's Government from their obligations under the 1914 pledge in respect of all future taxation. His Majesty's Government would, however, give their diplomatic support to the Sheikh should the Iraqi Government propose discriminatory taxation in future or claim for arrears of taxation for the period preceding 1932. The fact that the Sheikh was fixing an indemnity for the future might of course mean that the lump sum payment to the Sheikh might have to be somewhat higher than one basso, on a strict actual ial calculation, out oho Treasury/4 Treasury would no doubt prefer this to the possibility ox suostantial further sums having to be produced in respect of taxation at a later date. D . The proposed settlement with the Sheikh would not of course affect the possession question in any way. This would be left for disposal, when possible, by means of the land settlement procedure or by some other means. 6. It is not, of course, possible to forecast whether the Sheikh would be disposed to accept a solution on the lines indicated above, and in any case it is probable that there would have to be a good deal of discussion with him over the details. But we feel strongly that the proposal should be pursued, with as little delay as possible, if only to demonstrate that His Majesty's Government are really taking some steps to implement their undertakings. 7. As the position of the Sheikh of Moharamerah 1 s heirs must presumably be considered at the same time, we are inclined to think that it might be more convenient if the approach to the Treasury emanated from the foreign Office. It would also be more proper from the constitutional i^oinf of view (see in this connection5. Hale's demi-official letter to you of the 24th February, 1936, Ho.S.32453/12). We hope, however, that this letter will give you the necessary material for your c ommunic atio n. 8 .

The correspondence is mainly about the taxation imposed on the gardens by the Iraqi Government.British officials discuss statements of claims which cover the years 1932 and 1933, and which were submitted by the Shaikh of Kuwait and by Mirza Muhammad, Agent in Iraq to Shaikh Khaz'al, in respect of the losses both shaikhs suffered because of the imposition of the taxation system called
                           Istihlak(consumption) tax. The shaikhs claim that the Iraqi Government has imposed the
                           Istihlaktax system despite the fact that the gardens were exempted from taxations for the years 1932-1933.The volume contains statements on taxation paid on the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates in Iraq for the years 1934-1937. These statements are in Arabic and English and they were distributed among the Political Agency, Kuwait, and the Residency, Bushire. The volume also contains a report (ff 81-90) of the administration and management of the properties of the Ruler of Kuwait in the years 1933-1934 sent by the Shaikh’s general agent, Jacob Gabriel, to the Political Agent, Kuwait.The volume also contains correspondence between British officials discussing the question of compensation for the loss of income from the date gardens in Iraq belonging to the late Shaikh Khaz‘al, and the British Government’s decision to treat his heirs with the same level of respect.The main correspondence is between the Political Resident, Bushire, the Political Agent, Kuwait, British Ambassador, Baghdad, the India Office, London, the Foreign Office, London and the Ruler of Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Estates (land)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consumption</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Mohammerah</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Hakim of Kuwait Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh Emir of Mohammerah Khaz'al bin Jābir bin Mirdāw al-Ka'bī</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Taxation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Dates (fruit)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Date Gardens</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000055#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
