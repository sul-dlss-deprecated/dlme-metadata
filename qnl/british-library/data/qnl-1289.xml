Ctyy fr /JJL/ 'h British Consulate Basra, 2f7th January 1939. Sir I have the honour to report the following for information and such action as you may consider necessary. 2. On the 3rd January 1939 the Political Agent at Kuwait informed me by telegram that a German national called Mohamad had attempted to land at Kuwait without a visa. Although his entry was prevented he declared his determination^ to enter that territory, as also that fcf King Ibn Saud, by way 3. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom the Political Agent had addressed his telegram, requested further information regarding the individual, and after enquiries from a reliable source I discovered that 'Mohamed' was really Karl Stanek. styled as a student of entomology, who after staying sii months in Baghdad, embraced the Moslem faith and ther‘;dfter called himself Mohamed. 4. Herr Stanek called to see me on the 10th January and requested a visa for India on his German passport, No.158/38 issued at Bombay on the 10th December last. He told me that he had already received a visa for India from His Majesty's Consul at Baghdad in August 1938 and that he had then proceeded to Muscat, landed there, and after some days continued his journej to India where he surrendered his Austrian passport in exhhange for his present travel document. He left I n dia and then made an attempt to land at Kuwait, as explained in paragraph 2. Basra. The Secretary to the Govhr nmmt nf in the External Affairs Department New D„lhi, India.

I informed Herr Stanek that I could not give him a full wisa for India. He requested a transit visa. I then discovered that what he Really wanted was proof for my Iranian colleague that his intention of visiting Iran was merely to facilitate his journey through Afghanistan to India. 7. I have been unable to ascertain what this person's intentions really are. Nothing is known locally regarding the possiblity of his engaging in political activity but I feel that expensive circular tours, an abundance of funds and his religious convictions are matters which are not beyond suspicion. In the circumstances I have endorsed his passport with the statement 'Visa applied for India'. 8. I am sending cojies of this despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agents at Bahrain, Muscat and Kuwait, and to His Majesty's Consul at Baghdad.

Karl STANEK, Oerraan Aryan national (formerly Austrian), arrived here from Muscat by the S.S. H Bandra H on the 9th December 1938. He was then in possession of Austrian pass port No. 380577 issued at Tirana on the 17th March 1937, bearing a single journey transit visa for India No.1336 granted at Baghdad on the 30th August 1938. He was bom at Vienna on the 6th November 1914. His passport bore an endorsement made by H.M’s Consul at Baghdad 'That he leaves India by the same boat on which he arrives'. He did not come to notice in Bombay, and did not reside in any hotel which reports to this office the arrival of non-British subjects. His name does not appear in any ^passenger list of sailings from Bombay after his arrival. It is, however, possible that he travelled as a deck papsenger by a vessel leaving here for the Persian Gulf, as the shipping companies do not furnish a list of such passengers.CONFIBENTIAL . 2548 Copy of an Szpress letter No.C/96 oC1939&gt; dated/ the the 22nd February 1939, from Political Heiideht, Bushire, at Kuwait, to the Secretary to the Grovernment of India, External Affairs Department.

I enclose herewith a copy of a letter which I have received from Herr v attenberg, a member of the Iraq ^Subsi diary of F. Unduetsch Co., Bremen. Herr - attenberg called on me two days ago to Inform me that his Company wished to establish a branch in Bahrain, and I requested him to send me a written communication informing me of the scope of the proposed agency. 2* As you are aware there has been a great deal of German interest in this side of the Gulf recently, and several Gera&amp;n Journalists and commercial representatives have visited Bahrain in the past twelve months. I hear that the Hamburg - Amerika Line are considering reopening their service to the Gulf and the present communication is further evidence of German deter mination to establish a position in this area. 3. Instinct suggests that as many obstacles s are possi ble should be placed in the way of this venture. German firms may be satisfied with a smaller turn over than those of other nationalities but it is a little surprising that they should consider it worth while to establish a branch in Bahrain solely from the commercial point of view. I gather that the total/-(07) •2- total value of exports of shell to GemarQr ran, 7 QS about C 4000 annually a»d of Unduetsch* s M iaaln lines of Import business in Bahrain * 1 typewriters, radios, sewing machines and optical goods represent to them a microscopic business* One cannot help wondering therefore whether the wish to establish a branch in Bahrain has a solely commercial origin* 4. This is presumably a matter on which the views of His Highness should be obtained* But before approaching His Highness I would like to have instructions as to the line I myself am to take, for one may assume that His Highness will be guided entirely by our advice* I have no doubt that he could, if it is thought desirable, be induced to say that he is not anxious to see any more foreign nationalities represented in Bahrain and that if Unduotsch wish to establish a branch here they must appoint either a British or a Bahrain subject as their agent* 5. I am acknowledging the receipt of Herr Wattenberg* s letter and stating that I will communicate with him further in due course. Sd/- H. Weightman. Political Agent, BahrainCopy of letter dated Bahrain, 12th December 1938 from Herr Wattenberg, Manager, Unduetsch &amp; Co (Iraq) Ltd, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. We herewith beg to inform you that our firm has the intention to establish a branch in Bahrain and we should like to ask for your kind consideration of this undertaking• Please allow us to give you the following brief informations about our business and the purpose of the intended establishment* The firm P. Unduetsch &amp; Co., Bremen/Germany with whom we are cooperating is doing business in pearl shells with Bahrein Merchants since abt. 20 years. The said company used to be the main importers of Bahrain Shells for Germany and Germany is considered to be the main mar ket for Persian Gulf Shells. During the last years it has proved very difficult to sell the cheaper grades of shells which are mostly used for the manufacturing of small buttons. The reason is that these buttons are being imported in Germany as well as in other European countries from outside, specially Japan, at orices the European industry of buttons cannot compete with. As, however, from the lower grade shells large lots used to be shipped from this side the whole trade in Persian Gulf Shells is badly affected and suffering from selling difficulties. Our company has since long arrived to the conviction that an improvement of the business can be reached only by better selections end assortments of the shells overhere. Better prices and better sales would be possible then and at the s ame time our shippers here would be able to meet more successfully the competition on the German market of shells coming from other regions, f.i. Venezuela, La Paz, Panama, Massaua.- 2 - Our continued endeavours to induce our shippers to keep their consignments on a higher standard hve so far not lead to satisfacto y results# We therefore con sider it necessary to be in permanent personal contact with the Bahrein Shell Shippers to give them assistance and advice and to supervise their work at the spot here. So it is our desire to keep a permanent office in Bahrein for the said purpose. The office to be a branch or sub agency of Messrs# F. Unduetsch &amp; Co# (Iraq) JLtd., Baghdad, which is a priva-e Limited Conpaiay of Iraq under German Management and cooperating with F. Unduetsch &amp; Co., Bremen. The main business of the Bahrein Branch would be: to work as Agents of F# Unduetsch &amp; Co., Bremen in the pearl business of/shells, to cooperate with tl eir shippers in Bahrein end to improve generally the export of shells from this side. At the seme time the Bahrein firm to be established would carry on the import of general merchandise which was so far done by the above named two companies in Baghdad and Bremen through di ect communication with their customers or by their travelling representatives. Their main lines of import business in Bahrein are: Hurricane Lanterns, Household Articles, Typewriters, Badios, Sewing Machines, Photo Cameras &amp; Films, Optical loods, Pharmaceutical Goods, Building Material such as Water Pipes, Fittings, Iron Bars. We hope that these short informations might ex'lain the purpose of the branch v,e wish to establish in Bahrein. Please be so kind as to give your attention to this matt r as well as your recomnendation to the authority concerned. We should very much appreciate an early reply on the subject which please send to the undersigned who is at present staying in the Government Best House, Bahrein. Thanking you in advance.AIR MAIL P~~~7 ;o45 ?&gt; 12045/37 May, 1938.

The Hansa Line’s endeavour to negotiate a contract for grain reminds one of the German activities in this business before the European War 1914-1919 (see, for example, the enclosures to a letter dated the 14th November 1911 from the Board of Trade to the Foreign Office). 3. In April 1936 (see paragraph 47 of Bahrain Intelligence Report No.6 for the period April 1st to 16th 1936) the Hansa i, M|||| Line agent in Bushire (Herr H.I.Fritze) and the Line’s M&amp;nager for the Persian Gulf area (Herr Fritz Bruhn of Bremen) visited Bahrain on board one of the Hansa Line ships, which had brought material for the Bahrain Petroleum Company. 4. In a recent conversation with me the new Hansa Line agent at Bushire (Herr Johann-Kinrich Plate) showed considerable interest in Bahrain and rather hinted that he would like to visit the place. I am inclined to think that the Hh-nsa Line (who are now represented there by the Mesopo- tmU / 2 NOV 133® r' i A vJ' ^Mesopotamia Persia corporation) ma^r contemplate frying to open an agency at Bahrain* 5* Early this year in the case of a Japanese representative of the Mitsui Bussan Kaisha Limited (see paragraph 31 of the Bahrain Intelligence Report No* 4 or the period 16th February to 15th March 1936) the Bahrain Government took up the attitude that, while they were willing to permit new steamer agencies to be given to the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation(tfao have been long established in Bahrain and are well skilled in the land ing business), they wished to refuse to permit agencies to be given in future to any other firms who were not Arabs of Bahrain. 6. It seems undesirable that a German Line should open an agency with a German staff at Bahrain and so obtain a foothold at the heart of the Arab Littoral, and I would propose that, if the Bahrain Government are approached, they should reply that, though they are quite prepared to allow the Hans a Line agency to remain, as it is now, in the hands of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, they would not otherwise grant permission for anyone except a suitable Bahrain Arab firm to hold the agency* 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty’s Chargfe d*Affaires, Tehran, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf * * Division, and the Political Agent, Bahrain, and a copy of * Mr.Inman’s note to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Khorramshahr.

(a) . I am told that the ships for this service are to be taken from the Hew York-South Africa service which has been proving unprofitable. (b) . The Hansa Line hope to obtain the substantial Bahrain Petroleum company’s cargoes at present transhipped at Bombay* It appears, however, although the local Hansa agent seems to be unaware of this, that the shipment of these supplies is in the hands of a Jewish firm which refuses on principle to employ ary German shipping. It remains to be seen if this firm will be able to maintain its policy against the interests of the Oil company which dislikes exposing its material to the risks of breakage during transhipment. (c) . The service is likely in any case to hit the British India Steam Navigation Company’s export trade in dates, gum and other Gulf produce, sent to Bombay for transhipment to the United States# II. Export of Grain from Iran to Germany. The Hansa Line and the Iranian authorities have been negotiating a contract whereby the latter would ship about 3000 tons of grain a month from Bandar Shahpour by Hansa ships, and it appeared the deal was going through, when the Iranian authorities suddenly gave up the idea of a monthly forward contract, and told the Company that they would accumulate grain at Bandar Shahpour and ask for a ship when they wanted one. They were probably influenced in their decision by anxiety as to the future trend of world prices and as to next year’s harvest (this year’s (1936) was exceptionally plentiful), and possibly by doubts as to the ability / - 1- 2 - ability of the railway to deliver supplies according to schedule. The new arrangement appears to give less of a stranglehold on grain exports to the Bansa Line, and as the Iranian demand for shipping facilities is likely to be erratic and, from the view point of the Hansa Line, unpredictable, there may be some dissatisfaction on both sides. In any case the first attempt to use Bandar Shahpour for the export trade will be interesting to watch. III. Repercussions of German Raval Policy* Some of the Hansa ships on the Persian Gulf service are running with three engineers instead of four, as the demand for engineers for the Navy is causing a shortage. sd.

Foreign Shipping in the Gulf . Competition with Briti&amp;i shipping in the Gulf is at present confined to the Hansa Line (Germany) and to a few Russian and Japanese ships. Very shortly, however, according to a press message, Italy is to he represented in these waters by a regular monthly service of the Lloyd Triestino Line which will presumably be supported by a Government subsidy and will thus be able to offer lower cargo rates. There is already a marked absence of British goods in the Gulf. Provided that foreign goods are delivered by British shipping the situation has some compensating feature, but if subsidised foreign shipping has to be competed against as well as trade, this advantage will be reduced. As an example, at Bahrain, a few days ago, s.s. 'WOLFSBERG' of the Hansa line delivered about 240 tons of machinery (almost entirely for the Bahrain Petroleum Co.land a large quantity of Belgian sugar.Reference n.O.T..e 2 'fc£&lt;*.CV?

Initials. SECRET. POLITICAL DEPARTMENT. 19 SUBJECT. Previous Papers :— Persian Gulf» Inauguration of a regular service to the Persian Gulf by the Lloyd- Priestino Company &gt; Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The Foreign Office are consulting the Board of Trade and HJYI.Minister,Tehran, about this development which they regard as being of considerable potential importance, and we have also sent an express letter asking the Government of India and the Political Resident for their views. It seems clear that the Italian line is receiving a heavy Government subsidy, and it is considered that the Italian Government’s motives must be mainly political. The attached note prepared by the Department of Overseas Trade shows the foreign services at present running to the Persian/ 5041 2000 1.31Persian Golf with their ports of call as far as these can be specified. It will be seen that the German Hansa line is tne only one which hitherto has been maintaining what can be described as a fairly regular service. The Department of Overseas Trade think: that the Italian service will probably call at Bandar Shahpur and any other port for which they have sufficient cargo, and the possibility arises that they may wish to call at ports on the Arab Coast of the Gulf. We may, therefore, have to consider whether it is desirable that any steps should be taken to restrict the penetration of Italian influence into the Arab States. There can, of course, be no objection to Italian vessels landing cargo at Bahrain, Koweit or Muscat, but it might be considered necessary to prohibit the crews from landing at these ports, and some action may also have to be taken in regard to the Trucial Coast where, as far as is known, vessels belonging to foreign European States + have not hitherto made calls. The Trucial Shaikhs have in the past been generally hostile to the idea of visits being made by foreign vessels to their States and reference is invited to the papers at P.951/26 in the attached bound volume regarding the Shaikh of Debai l s refusal to allow the landing of cargo from a German vessel. There are precedents for excluding foreigners from the Arab Coast, and c a ■ 1 r ' ^ ^ after the war restrictions were imposed on Geiman nationals visiting any of the Arab States in the Gulf(please see Mr. Laithwaite 1 s note of 2nd October, 1930,f lagged). These restrictions on German nationals/. — ^ *^1 . - t»‘ •*'T ‘ - • ' i*' 4 ^ Minute Paper. nationals have since been withdrawn in the case of Bahrain, Muscat and Koweit. Restrictions have also been imposed on Soviet vessels, and in 1928 the Shaikhs of Xoweit and Bahrein were advised not to allow the crews of Russian vessels to land (B*2954/28). The Shaikh of Bahrein, who has a religious objection to Soviet citizens, went further than this, and in 19 29 the Bahrein Government issued a notification forbidding Russian vessels even to land cargoes at Bahrain.(P*320/30 ). Meanwhile we can await the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident, and the question whether any special action need be taken can be considered in the light of these.Secretary, E&gt; &amp; 0.Department » For information and any observations at tiiis stage. The question of the steps which it may be practicable and desirable to take to counter Italian efforts to develop their interests in the Gulf will need careful consideration once the views of the Resident and the Government of India have been received.

They will, therefore, probably call at Bandar Shahpour aid any other port for which they have sufficient cargo. The Sovtorgflot follow the usual Russian plan of butting in wherever they see a chance. The Swedish East Asiatic Co., made a few calls with Swedish railway material for the Persian Railway. They are not making further calls at present© While certain Japanese interests have their eyes on the Persian Gulf, they have not yet started running a regular line. 22nd January 1934</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000165_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3790</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000165</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3790</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/73 'German activities in the Gulf (inc Hansa line)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-17T22:06:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (83 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 84; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns various German activities in the Persian Gulf, principally the presence in the Gulf of German shipping, which was operated by the Hansa Line.
