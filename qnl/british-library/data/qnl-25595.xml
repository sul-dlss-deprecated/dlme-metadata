In assisting prisoners to escape in disguise to Persia from Russia, Persian officials and perhaps Persian Government are in agreement with the TurkishAmbassador and the Austrian Charge d’Affaires. Please refer to my telegrams Nos. 87 and 88; the three Austrian prisoners mentioned therein were sent here bv an ao’ent in Russian territory named Mirza Jawad Khan and were actually brought°by one Mohamet Sadie Beg via Kakhha to Meshed. Amm-uKah Khan is another agent in Russia. The whereabouts of these two agents are unknown to me but I have letter addressed to the former from Karguzar here in which he makes mention of Merv and Baku as places where he is most likely to meet latter. There are, however, I am informed by my coheague, no prisoners at Mery and that where there are prisoners the agents must be looked for At Askabad there are still some prisoners. The letter ^ 9 Kar'uzar bears his private seal apd is, I think m his own handwriting inmferb rliscmised somewhat. The receipt of the three Austrian prisoners is acknowledged by him with thanks and he praises Jawad Khan for the energy disSayed by him and encourages him to hope for handsome rewards from Turkish Ambassador and German and Austrian Legations. Zahir-ul-Mnlk is mentioned by Wm. Zahir is I believe in charge of the Turlnsh «ectaon o the Foreign. 6 Office as Agent who is conducting negotiations with Tmhish Ambassador and Austrian Charge d’Affaires in this connection .

Total expenditure incurred by me up to date is 138,000 tomans, o which 93,000 were drawn on Bushire and 40,000 on Tehran.

I may mention that Sonlet has informed me that German Consul, Ispahan, offered him 30,000 pounds to support Germans and to k ee P Mukhbir in Fars. And as already reported German Consul here otteie Kawam 100,000 tomans in return for similar services.

Secondly, secret service ex penditure proper. In this I propose to include following :—(1) Subsidising of local newspapers for which I have now arranged to counteract influence of four papers subsidised here by Germans. (2) Payment of extra guards for Consulate. (3) Rent of two gardens adjoining Consulate from which we were threatened with attack before arrival of Kawam and which are now occupied by his men. (4) Ordinary secret service expenditure such as payments to informants, &lt;&amp;c.

He was (1) uavoou ah i-n, on&gt;/-\ bv virtue of his strong anti given ttiis appointment some four montns a o 0 y British tendencies. .... (2) One Abdullah Khan has recently been appointed a Political Agent Borasjun by Herr Wassmuss. . ^ T?no-li«h at (3) One Aga Sufi, who has lost his right arm, is a ,! p 0 .

Be is very influential with the ersiSome 4 months a?o Haji Alt saw the three Indians mentioned above at Shiraz, where they attended a secret conference with Wassmuss. Aga Sufi and Wassmuss were shortly to proceed on a political mission into Afghanistan, where a number of German Military officers had already col- lected to take over command of the Amir’s troops. (S') Mr. Wassmuss had informed him (Haji Ah) that certain Greeks had recently arrived at Basrah, with false passports, Irom Shanghai. Ikey had instructions from the German Consul at Shanghai to set the Aiabs at Basrah against the British, but they had tailed in their mission as they had been arrested. Wote.-'f'hese Greeks were undoubtedly (1) Caravolos, now in iail in Bombay, who had a Greek passport, 0) Christos Nicolas Laondis, who had a Breach passport though he has been given a permit (No. 4/85 W., dated the 7th July 1915) to leave Bombay as a Greek subject (this man died at TWah't and (3) Neofitor Pisanis, who had an Italian passport, who left Bombay With permit No. 4819 W., dated the 8th July 1915. Pisanis was denorted from Basrah to Bombay, whence he sailed by the Italian Line for Eavut en route io Greece-wde permit No. 5560 W., dated ttie aOth August 1915. A separate report is being submitted in another connection on tue movements of these three men. (6) Mr. Wassmuss informed Haji Ali that a large consignment of firearms was on its wa^ to India from Snanghai. (7) Telegrams from Germany had been received in Askhabad to the following effect :— (a') Laro-e Turkish forces, under German officers, had collected at Baghdad, and it was believed in Persia that the Turks would soon reconquer the territory they had lost to the Biitish. (&amp;) There was strong anti-British feeling amongst the Indian Prisoners-of- war interned in Germany. (c) Seventeen thousand Indian Muhammadan soldiers had deserted to the Turks in the Dardanelles and were fighting against their former masters. (d) The Kaiser was very ill. (&lt;?) Great dissatisfaction was being felt in military circles against the conduct of the Crown Prince. (/) It was widely believed in Germany that a separate peace with Kussia was imminent. (g) Had it not been for the kindness of Roumania in permitting German officers and supplies to pass through, the Dardanelles would have fallen long ago. As regards item (6) above, Haji Ali did not divulge this information until he had been well primed with brandy (neat) and several glasses of bear at Delhi Station and was in a State of semi-intoxication. When he came to his more sober senses he was very much exercised at having said so much and hound Sub-Inspector Schiif to secrecy by all the oaths in the Arabic vocabul ary. He expressed great surprise at the extraordinary lack of arrangements existing in India for the search and examination of ships coming from the east. He said that the Germans had found it impossible to elude the surveil lance of the Customs approaching India from the west, but it was com paratively safe and easy to send ship-ioads of arms into the country from the Par East. He did not say that any arms had yet come into the country, but that the Germans had discovered an easy route by which to send them. Haji Ali also said that, shortly before the outrage at Bushire resulting in the assassination of two British officers, Wassmuss, accompanied by a number of Germans from Baghdad, distributed arms amongst the Persians in Bushire. Sub-Inspector Scbiff is of opinion that Haji Ali is not a true patriot and that kind treatment and bribery would probably induce him to make more revelations of interest.42 113 Telegram P. } No. S. 1081, dated the 25th October 1915.

Consul, Shiraz, telegraphs as follows:—“ No. 423, October 25th. General situation. “ I am I fear now forced to submit my opinion to you that it is im possible for us to remain here any longer unless Persian Government are prepared to take immediately vigorous steps to set matters right in Pars. Two outrages have now been committed with perfect impunity and that others will follow is certain. With the exception of my private servant and (?sowars) all have been either wounded or killed, and I am practically a prisoner myself. Together with our friends and employes, Kawam and I are constantly threatened with assassination. In fact situation is intoler able and is I‘'venture to think one to which no representative of Great Britain should be expected to submit. Of course I am most reluctant to recommend evacuation of Pars and I mvself am quite prepared to remain m region as long as agent of His Majesty’s Government at Tehran considers this desirable, but no useful purpose it seems to me can be served by our remaining here in sue circumstances any longer, and I am reluctant that our filends an °y e ® should be exposed to further risks. I do not think as long as German Consu43 and agents remain in Pars that any improvement can he expected in situation. Unless Persian Government are prepared and able to have them removed, in my opinion it is better for us to withdraw. I fear neither Kawam or Soulefc can be relied on to deal with situation adequately. “ One advantage of withdrawal would be that it would enable our author ities in Gulf and elsewhere to undertake such military and other measures as may be considered advisable. Persian Government, I would suggest, should he informed of expulsion of British from Shiraz and that it entails on the part of His Majesty’s Government following measures: — “ A. Military occupation of Sistan and Arabistan Gulf ports. “ B. Stoppage until situation in Persia is satisfactory of all trade with Southern Persia both import and export. “Withdrawal from Kerman and Yezd might he also necessary. Addressed Minister; repeated Resident, Bushire.” Ends. N. P ,—Of course if we can no longer look to Soulet and Kawam to save situation in Pars I see nothing for it but to direct Consul and British Colony to leave but though position of Consul is beyond question very perilous I can hardly think after his repeated expressions of completion (confidence ?) in them that these individuals are really incapable of taking effective action provided we are ready to finance them and that they understand that we look to them to administer province almost independently of central Government. We must expect if Consul leaves to see both Kawam and Soulet fall into enemy’s camp and effect on Kuhgelus and even on Bakhtiari would be deplorable. Of course I am most reluctant to ask Consul to remain in a position of so much danger, but interests at stake make it necessary it appears to me to hold out as long as possible. I think Kawam should be able to provide sufficient force to protect Consulate if we can find requisite money. Unless Indian military authorities can find sufficient force to undertake expedition inland simultaneous ly with contemplated reinforcement of Russian troops at Kasvin, I can see no advantages in evacuation. Occupation of Gulf Ports would have little useful effect and indeed would probably only result in adding fuel to hostility which has been raised against us by Germans. Repeated Petrograd and Sir P.

Some of Turkish o eers (my telegram No. 402), His Highness also admitted, might be taken into service of Persian Government. Purther I have received some evidence from Meshed which suggests that Minister for Foreign Affairs who has hitherto showm himself friendiv is also playing into German hands by assisting escape to {in no ?)

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Twenty Hazaras are being despatched to Birjand by Consul-General, Meshed, to join the 80 already received and Consul-General is of opinion that He can supply another 50 if we can equip them. He has also made an offer to permit Captain Thorburn to remain for some months in charge of these levies. The proposals have been discussed by the Officer Commanding, Nasratabad, and myself and he gladly welcomes both. In view of objections of the Chief of the General Staff to locate regular troops at any place other than Birjand, Sistan and Kacha, his idea is that levies should be posted in parties of about 20 at every stage along the trade route up to Kain, having the cross roads watched by scouts. Our present number of levies is not sufficient for this work. The services of Thorburn as Inspector of levy posts and Commander of same would be most valuable as he understands the local conditions and the men, while none of the military officers with the Column can speak the Persian language. Bor the present his headquarters wuuld be at Birjand where there is also no officer of the Indian Medical Service. Our Martini ammunition is unreliable, old and not enough in quantity. It is suggested by Colonel Wikeley that all levies may it possible be armed with Lee-Enfield rifles of old pattern, the supply of which can perhaps be obtained from India. It is understood by me that the General Staff are of opinion that the Com manding Officer should spend more money on arrangements for obtaining intelligence but the difficulty is in obtaining men who can be trusted. On both questions very early orders are solicited. Addressed to Government of India. • - , -No. 10125/3/A. .J JL. Headouarters Lahore Divisional Area. A Cj , dr . if fc * Mjutsnt General’s Branch.

Darya Begi, has handed me a letter from the Governor of Kasarun enclosing copy of a telegram from Kavvam to him as follows:—“ To-day, second Mnharram, the gendarmarie occupied and seized the citadel and government garden, the police department, and all fortified positions of town, and then warned British Consul, the Bank Manager, and the Superintendent of Telegraphs that they must leave for Bushire within an hour. Am hour later they arrested Consul and all foreign subjects and after taking them to barracks they were sent in the direction of Bushire.. I telephoned gendarmerie asking them for reason and they answered that it was done by order of Government and that Persia had entered into war. “ To-day also they have totally cut wire to Teheran ; I have no informa tion at all. Also there is no wire by which orders can reach me from my Government.” 1 hear from native sources that a detachment of about 40 gendarmes escorted Consul of Shiraz and party to Borazjun ; that there are about five Englishmen and four ladies there ; that the party had to come by a devious route to avoid Soulet who tried to intercept them, and that hostile Khans proposed to send Englishmen to Ahram for better security. Darya Begi has also sent me a letter from Shaikh of Jafar acknowledging the receipt of Darya’s letter giving information contained in your unnumbered telegrams dated 15th and 16th November. He expresses extreme astonish ment and states that people at Shiraz firmly believe that a state of war exists. Now he himself does not know what to believe. Think that it would be a good thing if Persian Government sent detailed telegrams explaining situation and issuing orders for guidance to J^let K a warn Shaikh Jafar and Ghazanfar care of Darya Begi, with instructions to latter to forward them at once to addresses by quickest possible means.V 1 Telegram from Bushire, Dated the 18th November 1915.

Other Ministers and the president of tire Council remain unchanged. parma Parma is now acting with great vigour and he feels fairly confident that with.our unstinted support he can save the situation so long as we can keep the Shah in Teheran and the troops at Kerej.

Arrival of Russian troops at Kerej twenty miles from Teheran and advance of a few outposts beyond that point caused great alarm here and the Shah made prepara tions to depart to Kum. Russian Minister and I were in vited to the Palace where the Prime Minister, President of the council and other Ministers (? groups omitted) we came to the following agreement: Troops will not advance beyond Kerej and meanwhile the Cabinet will be strengthened by the inclusion of Ain-ed-Dowleh and Parman Parma whose presence in it will be a guarantee to us of a policy of benevolent neutrality. As soon as our conversation with the new Cabinet for the purpose of agreeing as to the measures required for giving practical effect to this policy has begun, troops are xo withdraw from Kerej to Yengl: Imam viz., about half way to Kasvin and eventually to Kasvin. I earnestly (? group omitted: ? hope) that these arrangements will be approved,. It is quite certain that if the troops are not removed further from the capital the Shah will leave. We then saw the Shah to whom we explained the pro gramme and assured him that we would exert all our ef forts to obtain the assent of our Governments to it. His Majesty was very agitated but we left him with his promise that he would not leave the capital until we received a reply and he gave us assurances of intimate and cordial relations in future, still change his mind if the troops remain long a* I hope reply may be sent without delay as he Kerej.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majest y^ Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] PLUSI;, €.1 f POLITICAL.

Germans have been showing great activity for last few days. Large quantities of ammunition and arms and, it is said, bombs are being imported and German agents have increased considerably in number. Of course exact figures are not obtainable, but from reports received by me it is evident that Germans are constantly arriving in compara tively large numbers and in all Persia there cannot, I think, be less than two hundred and fifty Austrians, sixty Germans, most of whom are escaped prisoners of war from Trans-Caspia, and perhaps fifty Turks, renegade Indians, &amp;c., with eight thousand rifles, seven or eight machine guns, bombs, &amp;c. Insignificant as this force would be elsewhere, in Persia it is formidable with gendarmerie is entirely, and police probably disaffected, and with rigorous pressure and the worst elements in the country in the enemy’s pay. In addition to above, funds are being more lavishly spent than ever. Probably this spurt is due to their fear of the imminent fall of Baghdad which event would (include ?) present release eastward of line of communica tion with Constantinople and also to probable arrival of Grand Duke in Caucasus-which may imply military measures of a more rigorous nature in Persia. If I am correct in this surmise, Germans’ supreme efiort would appear to be imminent. I have not enough material to foretell wdth certainty the direction it will take, but for the present Hamadan appears to be present focus of attack. British Consul there is being openly threatened by German Consul w T ho gives out he is going to avenge arrest of Turkish Consul at Besht. The latter is said to have three hundred tribesmen who are led by a German in his pay and against these the Governor, who is timid though well disposed, has pohsidly extremely ill led men while police and gendarmerie forces are untrustworthy. Though Persian Government have sent a hundred Persian Cossacks from Tehran they admit the gravity of the situation and that the Consuls are in great danger. Bussian Minister is requesting permission from his Government to despatch a regiment of Cossacks from Lasvin. Provided they are not detained for an indefinite period there, I think, that would he good (move?); but we must not be led into undue weakening of our only force which is within striking distance of Tehran. Wassmuss is making great efforts in Ears to prevent new Governor of Bushire from going to take up his post. Sultanabad is threatened. It seems evident that Germans intend to make a move of some kind in Tehran, from fact that Swedish commandant of gendarmerie has been making enquiries of Armenians as to what attitude they would adopt if Persian Government should declare themselves on side of either of belligerents or if an attack were to be made on Christians. In month of Mouarram which begins now attempt would be certainly made as this is the time religions fanaticism easily roused. Is there any prospect of any more troops being sent to Kasvin by Russian Government ?

The following has been received from Consul at Shiraz. “For preserva tion of order in Fars we must now depend on Kaw^am and Soulet and we could not remain in Shiraz any longer without their goodwill and help. Both of these men have professed friendly feelings for us and Kawam especially has given evidence of his good faith. Therefore as matters are at present we'must continue to depend on these two chiefs and to help them financially. Till end of present financial year I suggest following rough programme :—(1) As cost of maintaining garrison at Shiraz subsidy to Kawam to defray expenses of sav 1,000 men. We could not, in present circumstances, stay here a day if his men were withdrawn. (2) To defray cost of expedition carried out either bv himself or by one of his brothers to restore order in littoral districts and on* Bushire road subsidy to Soulet. (3) To maintain order on main road subsidy to both Illkhanis.

Directly we hand over here the customs, revenue will pass to control of bank as before and none of it will be available for local administration. At the same time general revenue is nil. When custom bouse handed over business of Finance Department the balance was two tomans and except for small sums from Bunder Abbas and Liagah no revenue has been collected since. Needless to say none of hostile Khans has paid his revenue for years (?). Consequently Darya Begi will be entirely without funds and will not be able to carry on administration properly. I venture to suggest if we are giving a loan to Persian Government or a monthly dole, that a portion of this should be earmarked for Bushire administration. If we are not, I would suggest custom-house director should be authorised to contribute a fixed sum monthly towards local administration. , Custom-house receipts are very large now, and balance should be enough for interest on the loan ; but if it is not, the shareholders of bank, or whoever get interest, will not be the only persons who are losing interest on their money now a days.

With reference to correspondence regarding the occupation of Bushire, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of an article in the “ Jam-i-Jam ” describing the occupation ard the subsequent events. It is interesting as showing the length the pro-German papers will go in fabricating narratives of events and in falsifying facts. Nothing in this account, however, quite comes up to the Berlin report (published in the “Times” of September 6th) that we lost 2,000 casualties in the occupation of Bushire. Of course, as a matter of fact, not a single shot was fired. Sub-Enclosure. Translation of an article from the “Jam-i-Jam' entitled “The lamentable occurrences at Bushire'. (The following is from a torn letter sent us by our Bushire correspondent, which has reached us with great difficulty. It should be read by the Persians, and even if they have no feelings for Islam, they should feersorry for their fellow creatures and their humiliation. No century in history has ever seen Persia in such humiliation.) The lamentable occurrences at Bushire. On Sunday morning, the 26th Eamazan (August 8th), a number of British troops arrived at Bushire from the sea. Some of them went to the Customs House, some to the Post Office and some to the Telegraph Office and took possession thereof, and a proclamation was issued at noon of the same day by the Residency stating that they occupied the town of Bushire in comnliance with instructions from the Government of India, and that all the Government Departments would be under the control of Major Trevor, who had been ordered by the Government of India to govern Bushire on behalf of the said Government, and that he, Major Trevor, was Governor of Bushire and Bushire was under the occupation of the British Government. . Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh, knowing as he did that he had inflicted what misfortune hecouid on the people of Bushire, pretended sickness on that very night of the 26th, and did not come out of his house. 3 The British troops occupied the Amiriyeh, which is the Government House, some of them took up their abode at that place and the British flagwas hoisted °n the flagstaff. There were no private effects of the Muwaqqar- ud-Douleh in tiie Amiriyeh, they had already been removed outside, and tho only things which fell into the hands of the sepoys were the official files which were all removed to the Residency. The Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh himself received a reward of £7,000 from the Residency, and it is rumoured that he left yesterday for India. Oh ! God take revenge for the people of Bushire on him I At present there is an officer sitting in the Customs House, and all papers must be signed by him and all papers bear the mark of the Residency, and the receipts of the Customs have to be paid into the Residency. The British troops plundered the goods of people the very first day in the Customs. Pour sepoys were posted as guards at the Post Office. All the stamps and cash in the Post Office were removed to the Residency, and now jfn official has been placed by the Residency in the Post Office who opens all the people’s letters, reads them, and keeps those containing news, and sends those which do not contain any news to their destination. The stamps have been surcharged in English, which of course you will see, and weep for the stricken people of Bushire. All the income of the Post Office has to be paid to the Residency. All the members of the Postal Stall, including the head of that Department, are under the orders of the Censor on behalf of the Residency, who is in turn subordinate to the Residency. The British flag is hoisted on the Post Office flag-staff also. The Telegraph Office having been occupied, all the telegraph papers for 15 years back were sent to the Residency in three carts. Even waste and torn papers were collected from various corners and taken away. The telegraph instruments, old and new, were all carried away, and now there remains nothing except mats in the Telegraph Office. May God destroy Muwaqqar- ud-Douleh’s house in the same way as he destroyed the houses of the people of Bushire ! Oh 1 may my hand break I The Gendarmerie barracks are full of “ thin-legged ” sepoys, who, God is witness, have no knowledge of discipline, rifle, ammunition, guns or gunpowder. They do not know how to shoulder their rifles and when they hear the name of the Tangistanis they tremble with fear. They cannot sleep at nights through their fear of the Tangistanis. May God ruin Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh’s house! (It is a form of curse.) Now these thin-legged fellows are in the place of the Gendarmes who are like lions ! Oh God ! send us death, or blind our eyes so that we may not be able to see! Bags stuffed with sand have been placed on the Gendarmerie barracks to serve them as sangars. There were 13 sepoys in the Sarbazkhaneh, but they were all removed after 3 days. There are a few men in the Chahar-Burj to watch the flag-staff. British flags are hoisted on the flag-staffs of the Chahar- Birj, Post Office, Gendarmerie, the Customs and Amiriyeh. May God ruin Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh’s house! The people of Bushire are dumb-founded witl silence like stones. They are right, because they had protested so often, and‘pointed out that the Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh had sold the ports and that the after ports were no longer ours. No one gave them a hearing, and in particular the Ministers and Government authorities put cotton wool in their ears, and it seemed as if the ports were not under Persia. Alas for the state of the people of Bushire! Oh God ! give us either death or independence ! Oh! people of Shiraz ! it is a well-known saying “ When your neighoour’s head is shaved, you should wet yours ”! Eor God’s sake come to help us, tne people of Bushire ! The cry of us, the people of Bushire, does not reach Tehran! The valuable articles on board the Persian man-of-war “ Muzaffari ” have been removed to the Residency, and the British flag has been hoisted on her masts. Her crew have English badges on their caps, and wear English suits. Haji Yusuf has been appointed as Kalantar, and is installed at the Amiriyeh. Ear be some irreligious men from God ! Most of the people were willing that the English should be their masters. Also for them in the next world 1 Oh God 1 do not let them succeed in their desire!92 For tlie last 4 nights some religions men have proceeded every night to ransack the houses of the British even though the paths are barred, and many outposts have been erected. They went one night to the house of the Manager of the Bank and took away all the articles available there; and also 4 horses, 2 donkeys and 2 mules belonging to the xManagers of Gray Paul &amp; Co. They ripped up the stomachs of 2 out of the 4 Indian sepoys and took away 2 with themselves. They went to the house of the Manager of the Bank on another night, took away many articles and killed 3 Indians. They attacked the Malik’s house, which is the camp of the British troops, killed 35 Hindus, and carried away 12 men with them. However much the officers called to their men to fire, the rifles dropped from the Hindus’ hands through fear. It shows great bravery and enterprise that 10 or 12 men should proceed to a place where there are guns and which is the camp of troops and oppose more or less 2,000 Hindus, while not a single man of themselves should be hurt! There is now not a single foreigner outside the town ; they atl have had to come to town through fear. The foreigners said to the B.esidency :—“When you have landed so many troops, guns and munitions, and have closed all access, how is it that you are unable to prevent a band of 12 Tangistanis from worry ing us ? What force is this, then ? ” The Resident replied “ I am at a loss to know by which way they come in, when I have closed access by all the paths.” The Residency has been arresting people for the past 3 days and sending them to Ahmednagar in India. Some men who were formerly friends of the Germans and who talked evil of the British were arrested 3 days ago. At present the persons arrested are : Karblai Ghulam Reza Attar, Agha Bashi Bazzaz, Seyyid Safa and son Shah Nasri Agha Ali Akbar f Haberdasher and Aglsa Abdul Hussain Kazzaz. Some other men who held the same opinions as these persons and whom the Residency intended to arrest, left Bushire at once. 1 am too pressed for time to give a full description of the state of these persons, io be brief, they had ropes round their necks, and were taken to prison at the butt-ends of the rifles and in great humiliation wffiile their wives were crying and weeping after the manner of the family of Imam Hussain. These poor ladies were thrown on each other by the Hindus with the butt-erds of their rifles. They were all crying aloud and it was like the day of Ashura. Indeed it was a grievous spectacle to see. Oh God! I ask you in the name of the Holy Five that no Mussulman should live to see such a day ! x ^ owever they sent these men to Basrah, where they issued a notice saying u of war ca P tured at Bushire and that they had killed a ou » Tufangchis at Bushire. These were the pro-Germans whom I mentioned. Long live Persia, Turkey and Germany, and long live Unitv ?

T7mm pnrdosures Nos 7 and 8 it appears that on hearing of the appoint- ment ofthe Kawam and Nasir-ul-Mulk the confederate Khans and Shaikh Jatfar of Shiraz (now at Borasjun) telegraphed protesting and asking that the Mukhbir might be retained and the Darya Begi kept as Governor of the Gulf P &gt;rt The last enclosure an extract from a letter from Haidar Khan with which copies of certain telegrams Irom Kawam-ul-Mulk ana others were enclosed ^ent herewith) seem to show that Shaikh Jaffar has become a very influential Taking the whole correspondence (and of course there is a good deal more in the same style on record here), I think that the fact that the friendly Khans consider that the Darya Begi is not a nominee of the kawam or o the Persian Government but of Shaikh Jalfar and the hostile Khans, is not to be wondered at. Enclosure No. 1. Dated the 19th Shawwal 1333 (1st September 1915). From—The Darya Begi, To— Ahmad Khan of Angali. Inshallab, your health is good. I arrived here yesterday.

You should not of course neglect about it. Enclosure No. 2, Dated the 20th Shawwal 1333 (2nd September 1915). From—The Darya Begi, To— Haidar Khan of Hay at David. I do not know by the deceit of what devil you have lost your senses knd obtained a had name for yourself in Persia. As I hold a high opinion of your sense, I write plainly to ask you whether you are ready,, in return for your evil actions in the past, to give the hands of unity to your brethren in religion, and cheek the unbelievers who have invaded our country, or whether you prefer disgrace ? I am not in the least dependent on your co-operation.As I have maintained my friendly regards for yon since olden times, I am not content now that you should lea ve a stain on yourself in history, and write these few words to you as an ultimatum to ask you if you are ready to make reparation for the past and obtain a good name for yourself with the Persian nation, or not. If you are a Muhammadan and Persian, and regard me as your well-wisher, you should at once prepare yourself to serve your beloved land, and re-assure me with your word. If you are not, you should write to me plainly so that I may proceed to carry out my duty as a Muhammadan.

I will not write more than this. I am sending Mirza Mahmud Khan Sultan, and you can hand him the reply in writing. Enclosure No. 4. Extract from a letter from Muhammad Khan Hayat Daudi to Ahmad Khan of Angali, dated the 1st Zi Qa'adeh 1333 (l 2th September 1915). The news here is that yesterday evening Ali Khan Sultan came with a letter for the Sartip (Ismail) Khan, containing a telegram to the Darya Begi from the Governor-General of Pars. The telegram was briefly as follows *&lt; t 0 Governor of all the Ports, Dashti and Dashtistan. « From what I hear the conflict between Ismail Khan and Ghazanfar-us- Sultan is simply on account of their personal hostility and is not actuated by any other causes, according to the letters which he has^written. You should soon put an end to it thereby ridding Ismail Khan of it.” The letter also stated that he (Darya Begi) was whole-heartedly inclined towards Ismail Khan and that it was necessary that a place should be appoint ed for a meeting place, and an arrangement made for the settlement ot the whole affair and thet Ismail Khan should not listen to devils^ by which he means us ourselves. This is the purport of Darya Begi’s letter. The Sultan said that Darya Begi had strongly advised Mirza Muhammad Khan to cease to afford assistance to Agha Khan, and that he should be handed over to Ismail Khan, so that this trouble might be ended. He (the Sultan) was saying that they would surrender Agha Khan to Ismail Khan and the latter was at 'liberty to deal with him as he wished. I do not know if he was telling the truth or lying. I do not know what the Khan will reply to him _ * * * So much I know that he will hardly agree to an inter view with him, until Agha Khan’s affair has been brought to a definite issue.96 He also stated that the Darya Begi had received a telegram from the Government that he should himself proceed and not to allow anyone to fight with the British troops as they (the Government) were themselves trying to settle the matter. It is now decided that the Darya Begi should go to Sar-i- Bast and remain there so that no one should commit any hostile action there. fs Enclosure No. 5. Enclosure to Haidar Khan’s letter, dated the 16th Zi Qa’adeh 1333 (27th September 1915). Telegram, dated the 24th Somboleh 1333 (16th September 1915). Ffoin — The Prime Minister, Tehran, GhazaNbar-us-Soltaneh, Borasjun. (Copies to Ismail Khan and Agha Khan of Shabankareh.) It appears that the differences between you still continue to exist. At this juncture when the Government is busily engaged in diplomatio steps and other measures in order to effect a settlement of the question of the south and complete the arrangements there, it was expected that you would of your own accord stop your conflict in view of your respect for your Govern ment, and help to preserve order in your districts. I now call upon you as one who has been always counted as one of the servants of the State to cease these differences on receipt of this telegram and put a stop to your fighting. Of course considering your insight into the exigencies of the situation, you will not fail to cany out this order in the interests ot the country and ourselves. Enclosure No. 6. Dated the 10th Zi Qa'adeh 1333 (*21st September 1915). From— Shaikh Jaffar of Shiraz, Borasjun, To —Haidar Khan of Hayat Daud, Bandar Rig. After compliments. —In accordance with my duty to the Shara, I left Shiraz for these places in order to preach the orders for the assistance of Islam, and have now arrived at Borasjun. In view of my position, now I write to inform you that it is incumbent on all Muhammadans and especially the occupants of the frontiers to take steps without hesiiation and to give their lives and properties in order to ward off the unbelievers and remove their cruel hands from Bushire, and to stop their in trigues and deceits in Muhammadan lands, and their rule over Muhammadans. If anyone fails to follow this Divine order, it is obligatory on all who can to compel him to obedience to Divine orders. I therefore invite you, as one of the headmen of the tribes and chiefs of the people and a magnate amongst the inhabitants of these places, and in fact a treasure-house of Islam, to proceed to help our religion by the speediest means and to co-operate with me, so that we may carry out our sacred end with the help of other volunteers, and that thereby you may obtain a good name in this world, and be blessed in the other, and counted as one of. the helpers of God and ihe protectors of the Divine doctrines. It is obvious that after the receipt of this letter you will have no excuse to make and in view of my good opinion ot your devotion to Islam and devout ness, I trust that you will acclaim this Divine invitation with acceptance and make God and His Apostle pleased with yourself.

The day that they telegraphed tha the Darya Begi and others should return, the Darya Begi wanted to leave Mirza Muhammad Khan and Shaikh Jafrar went to the British telegraph office at Borasjun, and consulted with the head of the Gendarmes, who was also present at that meeting. They also sent for Darya Begi, and af e consultation they prevented the Darya Begi from going to Shiraz, and sent telegrams to Shiraz and Tehran. They have made tne British telegraph office the place for their consnltalions : and meet there every day, and bring about mischief, and at the instigation of Mirza Ali Kazerum telegraph to Shiraz and Tehran.

I said that there was little to add, as regards A, to what Russian Minister and I had told Minister for Foreign Affairs already, that is, that it did not lie with Uo. To me it seemed as if the hint thrown out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the Government retiring to Ispahan was nothing but a threat that Persia would throw in her lot with Germany it we did not agree to Persia's requirements in return for her benevolent neutrality. I was not much impressed by the threat as I was convinced that the Shah would not care to take a left seat m Prince Reuse’ carriage and I knew the Cabinet did not wish to see Persia involved in a war which could only have dis astrous results for her. If the Government was sincere in its professions towards us, it should have uhe courage sto declare its policy openly and let the world know that it frankly accepted our assurances that the troops had heen moved merely to ensure the safety of the Legation, etCr and had not an unfriendly purposer \7e had already given proof of our friendship hy according Moratorium and we must have some corresponding sign from Persiac His Excellency said that approach of troops might have a disastrous effect in the provinces., to which I retorted that the position ol our Consuls could hardly he worse than it is, thanks to the en tirely passive attitude of the Government and the open hostility of gendarmerie P As to Br the whole thing looked like blackmail, hut we were now in a position to defend ourselves and it was ridiculous to ask us to abandon be i^the trnnns now withdrew to Kasvin I should., probably, oe in une SKSt, S the consul at Shlras who toe leave his garden far 2 months, I should he position, and the nearer troops came tetter isnouic iaiPTapri a.s to the vSUhstance of the Persian proposals, the more I thought of them the less h^Fn°° d in h principle in which they had been framed.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 306. On proposed Bakhtiari agree ment I venture to make following observations :— 1. With reference to requirements of His Majesty’s Government and these of Khans. Attention is invited to Cox’s telegram 1082 B. It would not, I think, be impossible in respect of those of a general character and referring to protection of British interests to obtain from Khans here written assurances without our having to give any special undertaking in return on our part, but Kliaus would always find pretexts for evading fulfilment of their assurances if they should deem it advantageous with or without such undertaking. As regards a pledge from them to live on good terms with Sheikh of Mohammerah same observations apply also. Question of Liravi is different; in that direction Khans’ ambitions are well known and they sounded me only two days ago relative to acquiring it by purchase. I question whether the inducements which His Majesty’s Government are now prepared to hold out to them, would suffice to induce them to abandon their ambition formally. 2. In regard to our commitments. In eyes ol Khans a guarantee of internal autonomy would be valueless, as notion of any interference in tribal administration is a contingency quite unthinkable to them. It might, * Amir Habibulla Khan.however, he possible for us to succeed in representing guarantee of their territory as advantageous, although it is possible Khans might view such guarantee as a limitation of their expansion in future, especially when taken in coniunction with our stipulation (s) respecting Liravi territory. Contem plated promise of assistance to obtain appointments for them as Governor mig t prove embarrassing to us in (future ?) when ( ?) zone disappeared. _ Only available provinces in our gift will be Kerman (and ?) Yezd. In Cox s original sugnestion the one solid attraction for Khans was guarantee ot Ispahan Governorship and that being now ruled out small residue would give compact of not much value in their eyes. Moreover, question of Ispahan is to them ot such importance that it would come up inevitably in course of negotiations and from our refusal to give guarantee respecting Governorship no evasion on our part would avail to prevent Khans from deducing^ the conclusion that Ispahan is to fall definitely under influence of Russian Government. On our relations with Khans the effect of this would be disastrous. 3. Tor reasons given Consul-General Graham could not conduct nego tiations with Illkhani and Illbegi. Negotiations would have to be conducted in Tehran where two most important Khans now are and where Sirdar Jang will very soon ioin them. To negotiate with tribe, without letting them and all Persia see too far into our band, will, I think, be impossible, but I also think that without running above risk we can probably get assurances on some of points suggested by Cox, though I do not attach much value to such assurances, even'if we can obtain them. As a more practical and ess dangerous course I would suggest that Graham and Doctor Young in Bakhtian (country and ?) in Tehran (should?) endeavour to keep'tribe loyal to us by secret (?) service inducements. Khans are displaying a more satisfactory disposition here than they have shown for some time past.

Consul at Shiraz sends following message which is addressed to you No 77 (and with which)? I entirely agree:— Begins. In general terms I have explained in my telegram No. 353 to Tehran the nature and purport of the measures hitherto adopted by me. As desired I now submit the following further details :—Ex-Gorernor- General had long ago in German interests been engineering an agitation against us and had succeeded by means of the democratic party of which he was head in organising in town of Shiraz force over two thousand persons who were ready to carry (out) his programme. Besides this the Gendarmerie were hostile to us and manv Mullas were with him. A considerable force locally hostile to our interests was thus at his disposal. Before the occupation of Bushire matters were serious enough, but they became critical (after ?) that event. The occu pation of Bushire was used by pro-German(s) as a useful^pretext for more active agitation and under Gendermerie officers a corps of local volunteers was organised. Matters were made still more difficult owing to a lack of respons- ibfe Government. Threats which were made against us daily culminated in the murder of Vice-Consul.17 Programme was to drive British out of Pars altogether, and to kill Consul, and had It not been for the assistance rendered by the Kawam and his son it must have succeeded. In my telegram No. 353, I have given a general outline of the measures taken by them which have hitherto been a complete success and have (been) (? our salvation) at least temporarily. As to future we must continue to rely on support of Kawam and I hope of Soulet j if we wish to remain Shiraz. The situation here is still far from satisfactory, and the agitation would, were Kawam to withdraw his force, immediately revive and our position would be made untenable. The friendly co-operation of two Chiefs should, I therefore propose, continue to be invited and paid for. Of the measures proposed and taken I will keep Minister fully informed. Under the authority conveyed in your telegram No, 327 D. S. to Sir P. Cox funds have hitherto been obtained by bill(s) (of exchange) on Bushire. Except the last twenty thousand tomans which, at the request of Bank Manager, I drew on Minister and have requested Minister to adjust the amount in exchange with the Government of India. Accounts of all expendi ture have been kept and will be submitted in accordance with your telegram No. 774 S. Hoads are safe. Ends. 48 Telegram P., No. 184, dated (and received) the 9th October 1915.

Compared with Jang who appears to be the paramount figure ? Illkhani and illbegi are cyphers. Amongst the people the feeling is pre- , dominately anti-British and strongly pro-German. Set impression is that eventually whenever Jang gives the word the Bakhtiari will move against us. Regret is expressed that they were not permitted by Jang to capture oil-fields this summer. Ends. I arrive at the conclusion that in the event of a declaration being made against us by Jang we may, even if Illkhani is with us, expect an attack on the oil-fields and possibly on Ahwaz. | Repeated to Mohammerah, Bushire, Tehran, and addressed to Basrah. 54 Telegram P., No. 190, dated (and received) the J2th October 1915.

With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 590 C., dated 30th September 1915, regarding the arrest of Haji Ali “Germani ” near Lino-eh I have the honour to forward herewith a report from Mr. Vice- &amp; ’ Consul Howson, on the subject, together No. sio, dated 25 th September 1915 . w jth a non-committal statement made by Haji Ali. The arrest seems to have been smartly effected and the Tangistani Chief Tufangchi has been suitably rewarded.19 As already reported, Haji Ali “ German! ” is believed to be half German, bavins been (according to report) born of a German circus rider by a Moor or Algerian. Some notes about him appear on page 40 of the Persian Gulf Ad- ministration Report of 1912. Since he joined the Lingeh branch of Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Company fly he has always been the righthand man of the respective Managers, entering with zest into all their nefarious schemes. He was of great assistance to Mr. Brown in collecting (and possibly fabricating) documentary evidence in the Abu Musa case. He also used to assist and often arrange any little arms smuggling operations in the time of Mr. Randall and other Managers. I also remember when Gray Pauls first started at Lingeh Haji Ali frequently used to get up rows with their coolies, and on several occasions he tried to seize boats loaded with shells which were brought for Messrs. Gray Paul and Company against a loan. He accompanied Herr Manicke to Shiraz towards the end of May, and there is fairly good ground for supposing that when they passed through Bastak, he put up Ali Kambari and other notorious ruffians of the district to attack the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s Camp at Salak on Kishm. It is, however, impossible to prove this. As Haji Ali considered himself a German and identified himself absolutely with the firm of R. Wonckhaus and Company, I beg to suggest that he should be interned in India until the end of the war in the same manner as the superior employees of the firm. A copy of this has been sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and to the Chief Political Officer, Basrah. Enclosure. No. 310, dated the 25th September 1915. From—M r. W. R. Howson, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Lingeh, To— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Officer on Special Duty (in the absence of the Resident, Bushire). With reference to my telegram No. 106, dated the 24th September 1915, I have the honour to inform K you that on the 21st instant I received information from two sources that Haji Ali Germani had left Lar for Lingeh. The same night I despatched three Tangistani sowars under their chief Kaiyid Muham mad Hussain with two local men as guides with instructions to arrest Haji Aii who would probably be travelling in disguise, and to take him to Kung. The party met Haji Ali disguised as a Persian at Chumpa some 20 miles north of Lingeh on the 22nd and brought him in the same night. I rode out with a small escort and met the party at Bardagoon and took them on to Kung where the prisoner was handed over to the Haviidar commanding the Vice-Consulate guard. The same night I questioned Haji Ali and also took an inventory of his belongings. Lnclosed herewith is a short summary of the prisoner’s statement. It will be seen that he has given no information of value but this can be accounted for by his fear of punishment from his own countrymen, in fact he told one of my men that he would be killed even after the war if it were known he had given us information. The arrest was planned and carried out with secrecy and no one in Lingeh had an\ inkling of it till the morning of the 23rd. The same day the Deputy Governor wrote to me officially expressing his surprise at my action which he said constituted a breach of Persian neutrality and requesting me to release Haji Ali. He at the same time promised to despatch him into the interior without delay. I replied to the effect that the reason of Haji Ali’s visit to Lingeh was to foment trouble, and seeing that he (the Deputy Governor) was powerless, owing to the existing relations between himself and his tufangchis, to take the necessary measures, I had taken it up on myself to have the man arrested. I said I calculated my action was in the interests of both the Persian and British Governments.Regarding Ms reference to breach of neutrality I told him I considered e nmse 5 by holding' a public meeting in Lingeh at which he declared his intention of fighting the British in the event of their landing troops, had done his best to cause complication between our respective Governments. I drew his attention to my letter No. 275, dated the 27th August 1915, a cony of which I forwarded to you with my letter No. 277, dated the 28th August 1915. Ihinking it possible that the Deputy Governor might be foolish enough to attempt the release of the prisoner I gave orders for him to be embarked on a buggalow which was to be anchored outside the three-mile limit, there to await the arrival of S. S. “ Chakdarra”. On arrival of the steamer I shall have the prisoner put on hoard and conveyed to Bombay or elsewhere according to instinotions which I may receive from you in reply to my telegram under reference. Haji Ali claims to be the offspring of a German mother (still alive and residing in Germany) and a Moor father. He is fair, though now very sun burnt, and has grey eyes and light hair. He speaks German, English, Persian and Arabic fluently. He was formerly a professional acrobat but has been for years in the service of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company as interpreter. Haji Ali is a clever scoundrel and must have been very useful to the Germans in their attempts to stir up the Persians against us. As long ago as August 1914 he tried to bias the people of Lingeh against us and I was compelled to get the late Deputy Governor to put up public notices warning the people not to listen to him. Prom the papers found on Haji Ali, it will be seen that he had been appointed agent of the firm of Wonckhaus and Company with full powers. The firm have still got a large quantity of goods and considerable outstandings, and, according to Haji Ali’s own statement, he was instructed to collect and remit all monies due to the firm to the German Consul at Shiraz. Kaiyid Muhammad Hussain, who carried out the arrest, is a petty Tangi- stani chieftain. He was up to quite recently employed as Bais of Tufangchis at Bandar Abbas w hich position he resigned owing to a quarrel which he had with some of the Deputy Governor's favourites. On my arrival in Lingeh Kaiyid offered his services to us and as I liked his appearance and thought he might be of use to us I promised to do what I could to get him re-installed in Bandar Aboas. When I heard about Haji Ali’s movements I sounded him and he readily agreed to arrest him and he went about it in a workmanlike manner and with surprising secrecy. By his action Kaiyid has certainly made enemies of the Germans and probably of his own tribe and of the Persian authorities. As a reward for his services I have paid him Kraus 800 (about Bs. 200) in addition to Krans 200 for miscellaneous expenses, such as hire and feed of animals. I also promised to try and get him the post of Bais of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s guard at Salakh. This guard is at present supplied by the Deputy Governor, Bandar Abbas, with whom I anticipate no difficulty in making the new arrrangement whereby Kaiyid and his following of some ten men will find employment. I do not consider Bs. 200 was an adequate reward for the services of Kaiyid and his men, but 1 did not wish to spend more on him without sanction. I would like to bring to your kind notice the valuable assistance rendered to me in connection with this case by Khan Bahadur Agha Bedr and Assist ant Surgeon Johnstone. Sub-Enclosure.

I hear £rom a good source that a sine qua non of Persian reqiirements in return tor benevolent neutrality is to withdraw Russian troops. II this should be the case it will be clear that there is nothing to hope for by diplom atic means unless possibly some extraordinary concession on our part such as taking over of Persian debts and a pro mise of a nominal share in possession of Mesopotamia. Bo strong however is German position in the capital and in the vital parts of the country that I doubt much whether even so cabinet which is- I think sincerely anxious to avoid being dragged into war-, is strong enough, to stand them. And I fear that Ministers conscious of their own Impotence will put forward impossible demands so as to be able to lay on us responsibility of refusing them and so save their own face* Still as I understand His Majestyts Government desire to gain time I think we must respond to their overtures and show ourselves friendly and it is with this object in view that Nussian Minister and I have agreed to put moratorium into force.

There are however people who believe that risk may be taken provided that reinforcements are on the way. General Officer Commanding will move two regiments to Teheran if he receives instructions from headquarters but this step should not be taken without notice being given us here.

Persian Minister was informed yesterday that His Majesty’s Government were convinced from recent events in Persia and other symptoms that our enemies were de termined by various means to obtain full control of Persia and force her into a breach with Great Britain and Russia, Such a situation should not continue. It was a matter of* common sense for a country like Persia to keep on good terms with her two powerful neighbours and if she allowed herself to be forced into a quarrel she would one day bitterly repent having been duped by the machinations of the Central Powers. Persian Minister was urged to Impress this on his Government and to recommend them to follow your advice and that of your Russian colleague in a situation which might have very serious consequences for Persia.

If Germans intend to invade Sistan this winter, Officer Commanding, Nasratabad, does not think force under his command can safely hold Sistan as well as the road up to Kain. It is necessary to make very early arrangements for their accommodation if a portion of our troops are to remain at Birjand. I believe Russians will consider themselves justified in withdrawing to Meshed if our troops are withdrawn from Birjand. It will then be possible for Germans to establish themselves in force in Birjand. I beg early decision on this question may he formed.

Towards the end of May last he accompanied Herr Manicke from Lingah to Shiraz and we have reason to think (though there is no proof) that thev put up some cut-throats of Bastak to attack Anglo-Persian Oil Company Camp in Kishm. At Lingah I believe he was not treated by Germans as one of themselves but was regarded as a cut above the clerks and Mirzas of the office.

From —His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. On September 23rd the Officer Commanding, Sistan column, was ordered not to interfere with Persians unless they are escorting Germans. I submit that this order should be modified as he is now precluded from stopping Persian carriers of despatches. « Mr. New has interviewed Ali Akbar Tehvildar in his village (see my tele gram No. 24 F.). Latter stated that Paschen in disguise of a shepherd or camelman begged assistance to pass through our cordon as he had most important telegrams and despatches to send which on no account must fall into the enemies’ hands. He was advised to abandon the attempt. He then made his way back to Afghanistan. Another attempt has no doubt been made to get these despatches through, probably with an Afghan or Persian courier. I am persuaded that embargo still exists on export of wheat. We still require to send supplies to garrison at Kacha Koh. Some time ago I told Revenue Director that though we would give him a statement of wheat exported, we would oppose (with ? ) force any attempt to prevent export at Koh-i-Malik Siah. The Officer Commanding now states that he will not resist injunctions of Mirza. Consequently we shall have to ask Quetta to send supplies (?) at much heavier cost to Kacha Koh. As they also know that embargo is unreasonable, local Persian officials will entirely fail to understand this change of policy. In reply to my telegram of 27th September, No. 99. His Majesty’s Minister has telegraphed (No. 73, dated September 28th) '.—Begins. With the Persian Government I can do nothing. Ends. Before I sent my telegram 99, Shaukat told me that without permission of Persian Government he could not sanction building on Persian lands. The position now is that our troops will not be able to remain encamped on Consulate football ground, as this site becomes a lake in winter, and that no Persian subjects will dare to rent land to us unless we inform Persian authorities that we insist on taking it. The policy of Russians is in my humble opinion much better suited to the local circumstances though doubtless sometimes individual officers carry it to abuse and excess. In Gunabad Russians deported to Meshed an obstructive Mulla. In Kain they flogged Syads who refused to give them transport; everywhere they take a strong line which seems to be effective. A Customs Mirza assaulted and dragged from his house a levy in the service of Sistan column on August 30th. Revenue Director proposed that Mirza should be fined the sum of one toman. Pending a reference to Tehran I pressed Karguzar to keep Mirza under arrest. In spite of my reminders 26 days passed and no orders for his punishment arrived. I then permitted release of Mirza. Local authorities may be less amenable next time and I think we would have to take the law into our own hands, but this of course cannot^ be done without modification of existing orders. It seems to me that Persians cannot fail to notice present difference of policies of two powers. It signifies to them that in spite of all assertions to the contrary we still are not in (agreement ?) in some respects. 18 Telegram P., No. SO F„ dated the 2nd (received 3rd) October 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to Minister’s telegram No. 135 F. of 30th ultimo.Motor cars could hardly reach Afghanistan though they might with difficulty get as far east perhaps as Birjand. Germans only contemplate using them I think, on the Lut for instance between Ravar and Naiband or Neb which journey could be accomplished in a day. Thus in a very short time they would deposit considerable numbers of men east of desert. Importance of holding in force whole eastern fringe of Lut from Lehaneh Bagheh to Tabas seems to be accentuated by news in question. 19 Telegram P., No. 110 K., dated (and received) the 2nd October 1915. ]p rom The Hon'ble the Chief Commissioner and Agent to the Governor-General in the North-West Frontier Province, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. A Peshawar mistri employed in Amir’s powder factory who left Kabul on Tuesday last arrived at (Peshawar ?) to-day. He is exceptionally intelli gent man. He reports that a party of Germans, Austrians, Persians and Turks, all of whom were armed, arrived at Kabul about 10 days ago with one field gun drawn by 10 horses. Twenty of the party wore European clothes, the remaining 200 Turks, Pathans and Persians were dressed in oriental garb. Pour out of the 20 dressed in European clothes are leaders. Party was, on arrival at Kabul, accommodated at Babar Bagh where officials sent from Paghman made arrangements for them. *The party was at once joined at Babar by Sardars Inayatulla Khan and Nasrulla Khan who came from Paghman and they have remained with them ever since. The four leaders have not moved out of a house in Babar Bagh where they have most of the time been closeted with Inayatulla and have also frequently been visited by Nasrulla Khan. Correspondence passes between Sardars and the Amir, who is at Ozai Kas, five miles beyond Paghman. The 20 in European dress do not leave Babar Bagh but the native members of the party go about the country freely and talk. The latter say four leaders are high German Austrian and Turkish officials with letters from their sovereigns demanding alliance or at least free passage for an Army % Those who came before and who are still interned in Heh Afghanan, are in no way connected with this party. 20 Telegram P., No. 96 C., dated (and received) the 3rd October 1915.

Mabuho, Esq, C.B., His Britannic Majerty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. German Emissaries. I have the 12th September honour to forward, for your perusal, a copy of a letter, dated the 1915, from Mr. P. E. Dormer of the Indo-European TelegraphDepartment who is attached to this Consulate, reporting on his trip to Naihand in charge of 30 armed sowars for the purpose of gaining information about Germans’ movements and of seizing a small stock of supplies which was rumoured to have been carried from Tabas to Naiband by five Persians in German employ. 2. As regards the second of these objects, Mr. Dormer thinks that the rumour was untrue, but it is apparent that if the supplies had been in Naiband he could not have seized them owing to the hostility of the townspeople. 3 . I think that the information which he has brought hack is of great interest and that the expedition has served a good purpose in showing the people of this Province that we are ready to take the offensive against the Germans whenever suitable opportunity occurs in spite of the attendant risks. In this instance we had heard reports (since apparently found to be untrue) that the Germans were encamped in considerable force further north in the same district of Tabas, whence they might have attempted to intercept our party on the return journey. 4 . Mr. Dormer, in my opinion, led his party with great circumspection * For ir stance, 140 miles in so hours on the and courage, and the rapidity with which return journey. they moved* and the cheerfulness with which they endured the hardships of the journey are entirely the result of his own good example. Sub-enclosure. Dated Birjand, the 12th September 1915. From—P. E. Dormer, Esq., Indo-European Telegraph Department, To— Major F. B. Prideaux, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, Birjand. I have the honour to report on my journey to Naiband. I left Birjand, accompanied by S. A. S. Pazal Ilahi, ten Indian Cavalry including two Dafedars, 12 Afghan and Baluch Levies, five Persian Levies, one Vice-Consulate Ghulam, one Hospital attendant and two camel drivers, all mounted on camels at 11 p.h. on the 21st August 1915, and arrived at Khusp at 7-30 a.m. the following morning. Ten of the Governor’s sowars caught me up on the road and were subsequently relieved at Khusp by 10 Jambazes. At Kalata Khan (six miles from Birjand) a camelman bringing in firewood from Garmab informed me that he had heard that a party numbering about 50 had arrived at Kbur to purchase provisions. No one in Khusp had beard anything of this party, and I therefore decided to proceed. I however took the precaution of sending one Persian Levy and four Jambazes to Khur with orders for three of them to follow straight on to Garmab with confirmation or otherwise of the report, and for the other two to follow the day after with any further news. Me left Khusp at 8 p.m. having been delayed over the purchase of ' Golour ” for the camels, and arrived at Nali-Nau at 9-30 on the morning of the 23rd. We left again for Garmab at 5 p.m. reaching the latter place° at midnight. This march, performed after dark, is an extremely difficult one, the road passing through many river beds where signs of previous caravans having passed through are difficult to discern. My advance guard, guided by two pf the Governor’s Jambazes, experienced no difficulty, but the main body lost its way, the remaining four Jambazes with me asserting that they were unfamiliar with the route. An Afghan Levy would have been hopelessly lost had 1 not been able to follow him up with the aid of my glasses. At 8 a.m. on the 24th, whilst we were preparing to leave Garmab, our informer stationed at Naiband arrived with a report that five sowars of the Germans (three Tabrizis and twx) Ispahanis) had arrived from Kerman in advance of a party of 45—including a German—then said to be at Dehaneh Chehupai, two stages from Naiband on the Kerman road. I considered this number was exrggerated. The sowars had also stated that another party of 300 were seven or eight days behind and that both parties would unite at Naiband and proceed to Birjand.Another report given by our informer was to the effect that three or four hundred Germans had arrived at Duhuk and were also proceeding to Birjand. From enquiries subsequently made at ISJaiband and from recent arrivals from Meshed and Kerman I am satisfied that neither of these ever existed. I felt quite certain that both of these reports were grossly exaggerated and therefore decided to push on with caution. We arrived at Shand Ali Khan at 10 p.m. on the 24tb. I expected to find sufficient water for my party at this place, but the two small water holes in a river bed were almost dry, only about a pint of muddy brackish water being extracted from the two. All water carried in skins having been consumed during the early part of the afternoon, I was unable to proceed at dawn as planned. I sent off four men to a Haoz, two farsakhs distant, for water and these men only returned at 5 a.m. the following morning. At 6 a.m. on the 24th I despatched two of the Birjand Levies on foot and unarmed to reconnoitre Naiband and with orders to return and meet me at a spot out of sight of that place, but not less than four miles distant. At 8 a.m. the advance guard, and at 8-30 the main body, with the exception of a small rear-guard, moved forward. At about five miles from Naiband 25 to 30 camels were seen grazing and a party was sent to bring them in. They proved to be in charge of three Naibandis who had been engaged by the owners to look after them. They stated that a caravan of grain had come in the day before from Birjand, and that the grain had been sold in Naiband, and dates bought for return journey. I took one of the three men with me, promising to release him when I had proved the truth of his story. At this place the two scouts I had sent forward early in the morning rejoined me and reported that Naiband was clear of Germans and that their advance guard of three Tabrizis and two Ispahanis had left. We arrived at Naiband at 3-30 p.m., and camped in a date plantation below the village. It appears that we were at first taken for Germans, hut later on the Indian sowars were recognized as British soldiers. The people then showed extreme hostility towards ns. One story brought to me was to the effect that at evenin 01 prayer a meeting had been held and it had been decided to attack ns after dark. Another was that the Governor of Tabas, Imad-ul-Mulk, had issued instructions to the Naib of Naiband Naiband is under the labas Hukumat—to render every assistance to any German party, even by force of arms. Comments were made on the method of prayer adopted by the Sunnis of my party, some saying we were not Muhammadans but British troops in disguise! In view of the above I decided to immediately move my camp to a date plantation two miles below the village on tbe road to Shand All Khan. For- tun a tel v, on arrival, I bad given orders for each man to provide himself wi h bread sufficient for four days, and for all the water skins to be fit ed. With the exception of the theft of a blanket, ghiieem and overcoat belonging to a sowar (the two former were afterwards recovered) no hitch occurred in moving 1 posted five sentries round the camp and personally went the round every half an hour to see that all was well. Nothing happened during the At 10 A M (26th) I decided to visit the Naib and obtain from him, if possible, a clea^r idei of the situation. Accordingly I procured the assist- ance of a local man then in the camp and accompanied by S. A. S. haz nahi and four armed men proceeded to his .^ d o the Naib was very ill, consequently I thought it best no. to give any warnm 0 of my intention which might have been met with a leiusal. 1 found him suffering from an enlarged tumour in the abdomen and nartial v blind It was impossible to do much for him, hut medicines were partially m K Tavil Ilahi’s opinion was that he would be ,«l» doubtlul b. -bid “r 10 operation even if he consented to undergo one. I tried to induce him to come into Biriand for this purpose. Some other cases were sin fully treated by S A S Rzal Ilahi, including a nasty street accident to a child. I consuler the ore ence of the doctor did a lot to allay the suspicions of the crowd who had collected outside, some even entering the room where we were seated. I exnlained to the Naib that his people had mistaken my party for Germans! but that in reality we were British; that we had come to investigate the movements of German parties, and that I regretted to see the hostility shown towards ns on the previous evening. He denied any knowledge ot my arrival or of my business, and said that I had been misinformed legarmn the attitude of his people. I pointed out that he could not expect to gam anything hv siding w-itlAhe Germans. They might spend money freely to-day and would be gone to-morrow but it was not so with the British and Russian Governments who were Persia’s neighbours. It was those Government he should support and not the Germans who were too far away to be able to carrv out any promises they might make. I told him it was the object of the Germans to ie!d Persia into war with the Russians and British and I showed hfm“ OW impossible it was for Persia to emerge successful He was visibly imnressed by what I had said and remained silent, but an old man Sitting in the room remarked that they had seen no Germans. I replied tt was no use Iving over what had happened. I had the previous evening heard from several sources that 12 . days prior to my arrival two Germans, one badly wounded, with three or four servants, had stayed two or three days at Raiband before continuing their journey to Kerman ; also that many small parties-some said including Germans—had passed through Irom both sides. The interview lasted nearly an hour, and I think gave those present to understand the seiiousness of the situation. On my departure I remarked that I would probably return. No relreshments were offered. The specific purpose of my journey was to ascertain what had become of a party of five sowars accompanying a caravan of 11 camels carrying giain to Naiband for the use of the Germans, and if posssble to apprehend it. I defi nitely ascertained that no such caravan had arrived. It doubtless went from Khur to Duhuk, the departure from Klmr towards Naiband being merely a 'blind. The five sowars previously mentioned as having arrived at Naiband on the 22nd really arrived on the evening of the 21st, and not from Kerman but from Tabas. It appears that at Duhuk a dispute arose between them and one of the party was disarmed and made to walk into Naiband. Dour left for Kerman on the 23rd and the 5th only left in the early morning of the day I arrived. He travelled on a mule and was unarmed, therefore I did not consider him sufficiently important to follow, even had there been a reasonable chance of catching him. This party gave out that there had been a fight between a German party near Tabas with the Russians and they were going to bring assistance. On my return from my interview with the Naib it was reported to me that a party of 4 fi Germans were approaching Naiband from Duhuk. The origin of the report was obscure, but 1 thought it best to send out a man to Chashmeh Gazu and also one to Hauz-i-Khan. These left on foot in the early afternoon. At sunset 1 moved my camp a further three miles from the village into an open plain commanding the Duhuk road, from which spot I could make the best use of my force. Nothing however happened. A Darwesh pilgrim from Meshed who reached Naiband the same evening confirmed my suspicion that no hostile force was approaching. The following morning (27tb) I returned to my camping ground two miles from Naiband. At 9 a.m. my messengers to Chashmeh Gazu and Hauz-i-Khan returned and reported no signs oi any Germans. With regard to the camels seen grazing outside Naiband, I ascertained that they had arrived on the 23rd from near Gunabad. The owner was well known to the headman of my Persian Levies. His original intention was to sell the grain in Birjand, carrying out his annual programme, but having heard at Kain that the Russians were at Eirjand and that they would con fiscate his camels and loads he decided to dispose of it at Naiband. I wasat first inclined to regard him as being in German pay, but enquiries showed that he had sold^ the grain in small quantities to various people. I therefore did not feel justified in taking any action against him. 1 would here beg to urge the necessity for stopping caravans going to Naiband by blocking all roads from the Kainat. The Naibandis could doubt less get sufficient grain from Duhuk and Ravar for their own needs but not sufficient to supply to German parties. Duhuk, I am inclined to think, must now be almost devoid of grain. Owing to the Russian occupation of Tabas and Tun, Naiband will possibly become an important stepping off place for the Germans, therefore to prevent supplies in any great quantity reaching that place should have good results. I think, with the Germans in occupation of Naiband, the place would he an exceedingly difficult one to attack without mountain guns. From the Birjand side it is approached through low hills for two miles, practically the whole of this distance being commanded by the village. The village itself is built on a hill commanding a wide stretch of country on all sides, the houses reaching to half way down at which point the date plantations start. The streets are extremely precipitous, tortuous and narrow. There are several fort-like turrets on a small scale at various points in the village, but I saw no fort. These turrets would only hold a few riflemen. The approaches from the Kerman and Meshed sides are exactly similar with the exception that the Meshed road is hidden from the village until it emerges into a river-bed about a quarter of a mile distant. The fighting men are ^ said to number 300 each armed with one modern and one old pattern rifle with 20 to 30 Kaini maunds of cartridges, mostly locally loaded. A suspicious character I met at Naiband deserves mention. He called himself jyiuhammad Jan and stated he was an Afghan residing at Saidaki in Sistan. He informed me that he was returning to his home from Kerman, where he had stayed for two or three months. With him were two women, some children and three followers, all of the latter being armed. Muhammad Jan himself had an almost new Mauser pistol! He had eight camels with him. Kerman to Sistan via Naiband, Sar-i-Chah and Neb seems to be a very roundabout route. The five remaining Jambazes supplied by the Governor (four were sent to Khur and never rejoined me and one returned to Birjand from Garmab with a note) deserted from my camp on the night of the 26th and were not seen again. I afterwards learnt that they bad proceeded to their homes at Sar-i- Chah. They had evidently been frightened by the hostile attitude of the Naibandis. I left Naiband at 4 p.m. on the 27th and reached Birjand at 8 a.m. on the 31st August without incident. In concluding I would like to mention the great assistance rendered me bv S. A. S. Fazal llahi, who, besides attending to his own duties, was most assiduous in collecting news. Dafedar Muhammad Khan also worked very hard with the transport and maintained excellent discipline throughout. I am submitting under separate letter a statement showing sums expended in small presents. The total only amounts to about Krans 200. 25 Telegram P., No. S. 1015, dated the 4th October 1915. p rom qhe Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla, To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran.

His Highness knew that such a payment was materially impossible and it looked as if he wanted not to proceed- with the arrangement but hoped to get better terms elsewhere and I must tell him frankly whalmy Russian colleague had told him already viz: that local report said that the Government was negotiating with the German Minister. This he vehemently (?group omitted ?denied). He declared that money would not suffice to pay seven or eight months arrears of payment due in Government Departments, that it was absolutely necessary for Government to get it at once and that he knew for a fact that Bank could find the money. I said he was mis taken and he then made various suggestions essence of which was that the above-mentioned sum should be paid over within six weeks, I said that the two Governments were ready to give Persia financial assistance on the understandingunderstanding that the Persian ovenment would take sueps uo sooe the Gerraan campaign here but that nothing Wuatever had oeen done tc that end. uennau importation oX arms continued unchecked, Gendamcrie was as hostile as ever, proper support was noe given to those provincial Governors who tried to check German agents, condition of Shiraz was as bad as ever, Persian officers who had been educated in imicey nad oeen presented to the Shah by tine Turkish military Attach^ and ware to be appointed to the new national force, Karguzar-of Meshed was smuggling escapted Austrian prisoners of war to Teheran.

Prime Minister's explanations of the facts I put Defore him were very lame and inadequate and his general attitude unsatisfactory.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. I have to-day received the following from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz :— Begins. No. 332. Soulet. I respectfully venture to express my entire concur rence in views which have been put forward by the Government of India regard ing undesirability of entangling ourselves with local Khans, and it has always been my opinion that (taking ?) sides for or against insignificant Khans like those of Shabanara and Borasjun, &amp;c., and identifying ourselves in their quarrels has been (? greatest) mistake possible. This policy has been source of much of our trouble in south and has been brought about as I venture to think in great part by misapprehension of Persian affairs as a whole by officers serving at Bushire and by anomalous system of Consular representation in Pars. But I venture to submit that it is entirely different matter as regards question of relations with Illkhanis of great tribal groups of Pars. These (Chiefs ?) effectually wield influence over very large tracts of country over thousands of armed men and scores of smaller Khans and in fact they may be said to be virtual rulers of South Persia. With regard to these two powerful Chiefs 1 have long advocated adoption of some definite line of policy (and ?) at present time force of circumstances compel us to do so. ^ If satisfactory agreement with Soulet and Kavam can now be made, our position in the pro vince of Pars will become a comparatively secure one and minor difficulties in the nature of those enumerated in Bushire telegram No. 560 C., will unravel themselves, especially after restoration of Bushire to Persian Government. But we must naturally expect Germans to take advantage of our failure if we allow this opportunity to slip and in this eventuality situation will probably become impossible in inland of Pars. You might impress fact on Government of India that in no circumstances would an agreement with Soulet impose on us obligation to despatch troops inland into Pars. The chief difficulty which I foresee is vis-a-vis Persian Government and different Governors-General of Pars who might intrigue against our protege and who might not approve our protection of Soulet or favour guarantee of Illkhani. For this we should have to be prepared and be ready to take necessary stens to render either Soulet or Kavam as case might be, independent of such intrigues Eventual situation which will crop up in South Persia will ot course depend on result, but meanwhile it is absolutely essential as I venture to think if we wish to remain here at all that we should seize opportunity to cement friendly relations and have powerful Chief as Soulet on our side. The foreooing is addressed to Foreign Office, London, and is repeated to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. 272 Telegram P., No. 153, dated (and received) the 22nd September 1915.

Prideatjx, C.T.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistas and Kain, ip 0 Tta Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Mustaufi, the Governor-General, and Sahib Jam, his Chief Camel Corps Officer, are letting out on hire to Birjand traders 120 camels o go and bring back loads from Nushki. lam providing camel drivers with a letter of recommendation. Similarly Vice-Consul, Sistan, has been in negotiation with Sardar Khndadad Khan to send 730 camels for Meshed and Sistan loads. Sardar says he will gladly send his camels to Nusbki and will also recall his tribes men who are now in Afghanistan if we will afford him protec ion against Shaukat. He is even willing to accept a slightly reduced rate of hire for his camels. He can probably get some of Taj Mahomedi s, if his own camels are not sufficient in number. Sardar is only afraid at present that Governor may try to appropriate some of his camels, if they appear on the trade route(s). The position would appear to be that the Sardar has no intention of carrying out the written promises, which he gave to Shaukat, as regards paying for property looted by Naruis from Kainat. He has considerable influence with Imailzais of Sarhad and the Narms. Sardar is sure to side with Germans should they threaten Sistan, if we do not come to an arrange ment with him. I was giving all the moral support X could to the Governor until last June in his efforts to reduce Baluchis to submission in order to prevent recrudescence of raiding. Shaukat on the other hand, however, declines to help us against Germans. I therefore see no reason why we should not enter into friendly compact with Baluchis of Sistan, which will entail to a certain extent our supporting them against local authorities, when Baluchis come within latter s reach in consequence of their commencing to work on our behalf. 1 will also give sanctuary to Sardar Purdil Khan here and will send him to Sistan, which act will also gratify Khudadad very much if I am permitted to embark on a policy of rapprochement with these Baluchis. We should I think spend money freely among these Baluchis in Sistan to secure their co-operation. In last Afghan war Purdil Khan assisted ns. It appears that the people of this province do not regard German menace seriously at present, to judge from the anxiety of traders in Birjand and Sistan to get their goods from India and from the fact that Governor own&amp; that men are willing to send camels. 275 Telegram R., No. 128, dated the 22nd (received 23rd) September 1915.

New and Hale from Kain to Birjand, 1 have the honour to enclose a copy of Mr. New’s report describing the events which occurred after the Germans’ arrival in Kam up to the time of the Russians’ departure. 2 It has been established that the Russians took up their quarters, and ni first even stabled their horses, in the Jama Masjid, and also that they instituted a house to house search for arms and German property which may have been carried out in some cases rather harshly. No doubt the Officer Com manding was extremely indignant at the Germans being helped to escape while all information was carefully held up from himself. The accounts which reached Birjand of women being raped seem to be untrue and the general looting was evidently not of great magnitude. A’pertain amount of pilfering naturally occurred, and a number of privately owned rifles have P been carried oif by the Cossacks to Meshed, to recover which the Kainis will probably experience considerable difficulty. The matters which have created the greatest harm are the unfortunate deaths i of two Persian subjects, both of whom were servants ot the Governor himseit. The Persians unanimously believe that the Cossacks shot these two men, and as the truth cannot be satisfactorily established one way or the other, I and as the ill-feeling engendered against the Russians on thR acco^nt is eradicated.

Prideaux, C.I.E, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for S.stan and Kain, Birjand. I have the honour to submit the following report on my journey to City - “t? •sr night at Hruuj (12 miles) where our Persian escort of 30 sowars under Haider AU Khan picked us up at midnight.w i 104 Next day, the 6th, we moved on to Siddeh, arriying there at noon. Here we heard the Eussian troops at Kam bad evacuated the city m great haste and that the German party were expected to return to Kam at any moment. This led us to suppose that a strong German force from Tabas might be advancing on Kain. Two Persian sowars were sent out to Kam, and we decided to move on to Bum on the 6th morning and wait there for news. We ao t no information at Bum, and the situation still seemed alarming, but we decided to push on cautiously. The sowars sent to Kam met us six miles from the city and reported all was quiet there although there was no reliable news of the Germans or the Russians. We reached the city at 8-30 p.m. on the 6th. Mirza Assadullah Khan, who was deputed by the Governor to accompany us and temporarily take up the Deputy Governorship of Kain, joined us at Siddeh on the 5th evening. 3. At Kain we heard the Russian troops had reached Gunabad, hut no reliable news of the Germans could he obtained. Special Kossids were sent out to Bey hud and Tun. The Beyhud Kossid returned on the night of the 7th and reported that a party of Russian troops chased the Germans as far as Sarayun, but the latter had about two days start and apparently got away to Tun. 4. On the afternoon of the 7th two suspicious-looking persons, one of whom appeared to he a Sistani, were seen loitering near the house we occupied, the same house where the Germans stayed. They were first detected by Mr. Hale’s servant Ismail, who did good work, and I would recommend him for a present if Mr. Hale has no objection. I ordered the two men to be arrested and sent them to the Deputy sent the men back to me with a verbal known to his servants and the other a local perfectly innocent people. The men were found they were contradicting themselves. My Mnnshi, Saiyid Ghulam Reza, was exceptionally smart in cross question ing these suspects, and eventually under threats he prevailed upon the Sistani to tell the whole truth. I was very pleased with the intelligent work of my young Mirza and would strongly recommend him for a bonus of one month’s pay. I attach (Appendix B) the statement made by the Sistani, Muhammad Taqi, son of Kerbelai Ali Ahbar, resident of the village of Taghazai in Sistan, who took service with the German party at Tabas. 5. At Kain I took the statement of the Persian Telegraph Master, Muhammad Yali Mirza, who appeared to he a clear-headed, honest, and impar tial person, and his story of recent happenings at Kain in connection with the arrival there of the German party and of the Russian troops, is attached (Appendix A). The account is very complete. Independent enquiries from other sources also showed that the stories we had heard of the behaviour of the Russian Cossacks were very greatly exaggerated. All were of the opinion that the Telegraph Ghulam Muhammad was responsible for most of the thefts which occurred and that he also blackmailed many people. I personally visited the Masjid and could not detect that any damage had been done to the building hut I was told a prodigious amount of refuse had been cleared out. It is not true that the Cossacks cooked their food inside the Masjid, hut the outer wall in places was blackened by fire. 6. ^ On the 7th instant, when visiting Mirza Assadullah Khan, we found the chief Mujtahid, Haji Saiyid Jowad, and many of the leading Saiyids were with him. Haji Saiyid Jowad delivered a long sermon beseeching the British Government to protect the people of Kain from persecution and recounting the alleged misdeeds of the Cossacks. Mr. Hale, with his fluent knowledge of Persian, rose to the occasion and in a very tactful address in a voice that all could hear, calmed the Mullas’ fears. M e were fortunately able to say M. Samsonoff was expected to arrive the next day and that he was the proper person to hear any complaints, men Governor for examination. He message that one was a Sistani Kami, and both appeared to be further interrogated until it was105 The Mulla and the Deputy-Governor strongly pressed me to take the statements of several persons who had complaints to make, but this I refused to do. At the conclusion of the interview the Mujtahid was smiling and pleased. He dismissed the congregation of Saiyids and told us confidentially the populace looked to him to do something in the matter of their grievances I It was only at the end of the interview, almost as an afterthought, that the Mujtahid mentioned the Cossacks had occupied the Masjid and that it would cost 2,000 Tumans to repair the damage 1 7. Monsieur Samsonoff arrived at Khidri on the 7th instant. Prom there he sent a note in Russian to the Officer Commanding the Cossacks, which -reached us in the evening by the postal courier who was told to say M. Samsonofl: would stay at Khidri until he received a reply to the note, ap parently also fearing that the Germans had possibly returned to Kain. I sent .a letter off to M. Samsonoff the same evening informing him of the position, and he reached Kain the following day at 10 a.m. At noon we accompanied M. Samsonoff on a visit to the Deputy Governor. He announced he had been specially sent by his Government to act as Political Officer to the Russian troops, and to investigate any complaints people had to make. He further stated an additional force of about 1,000 Cossacks would arrive from Turbat in a few days, and exhorted the Deputy Governor and the people of Kain to give him every assistance in procuring provisions for the troops. I gave M. Samsonoff all the information we had gathered, including copies of the statements of the Sistani we had caught and the statement of a German “ syce ”, who was brought in later, together with a copy of the letter found on the Sistani (in veiled code, with explanations of the terms used) and a copy of the cypher telegram sent by the Germans while at Kain. We were able to smooth the way for M. Samsonoff by showing the people he was coming to rectify their grievances ; to introduce him to the Deputy Governor (a personal friend) and to induce him and the people of Kain to greet M. Samsonoff with open arms and extend to him the same friendship thev had for us. Indeed, l am perfectly sure Mirza Assadullah Khan would not have remained at Kain if we had not been there to induce him to do so, and the absence of a representative of the Governor would have created an impossible position for M. Samsonoff, who would have been forced to take up a role of Dictator. M. Samsonoff arrived at Kain with only one _ Cossack and a personal servant. He told us he had practically no ammunition, having expended all he had in driving off a band of robbers who attacked him near Gunabad. At his express desire we remained at Kain an extra day, the 9th instant. I was able to send some cypher telegrams for M. Samsonoff and altogether X think he had cause to be grateful for the assistance we v ere able to give him. The Sistani’s statement particularly was of the greates importance to him and enabled him to wire to Turbat and effect the arrest of Herr Jaeger and t Armenian, Khwaja Ibrahim. 3 The Sistani’s statement disclosed the fact that a syce (groom) off^e Krimanj and he was brought back to Earn. His statement (Appendix c; attached, but it is of little value. 9 We left Kain on the morning of the 10th instant accompanied by Haider A?Ehan and n ten sowars, and reached Birjand on the mormng of the 12th without incident. rc • n 1 10. In conclusion, I ^Syouwiilhesogoodas to conyey officially to Mr. Hale an expression of my smeere uianKs m J dered the services. t^Tvarious^totements and reducing them to writing.

He was most friendly and loyal and has pro mised to keep us secretly informed of everything happening at Kain. X would, recommend him for a good present in recognition of his services.. At Kain I made the following presents :^ Krans^ Telegraph Master, Muhammad Yali Mirza ... 1,000 Telegraph Peon at Kain ... ... ... 30 Muhammad Sharif Beg, special messenger to Beyhud and subsequently sent to Tun ... ... 100 Present to a Tuni for information ... ... 20 Total ... 1,150 I would specially recommend the following for presents Krans.

If you would he pleased to sanction a distribution of 100 Tumans among them I think they deserve it and it would also make a good impression among the local forces. On nearing Kain and after our arrival there the absence of any reliable news of the whereabouts of the German party made our position most critical and as an incentive in order to obtain the best and early information, I let the sowars, understand they might expect presents if they worked well. Appendix A. 7th August 1915*. STATEMENT OF THE TELEGRAPH MASTER AT KAIN, MUHAMMAD YALI MIRZA. Germans’ arrival.—R q says he was at the Masjid at noon the day the* German party arrived. Six of their men came in first,, four of whom came to&lt; the Masjid and tried to induce the gentry of Kain to go out and meet the two Germans, who claimed to be Consuls. No one went out and subsequently the Telegraph Master explained to the Germans’ interpreter (named Abbas Mirza, son of Jehansouz Mirza) that the Deputy Governor of the town was absent and there were no big people here. Aga Muhammad Taki (brother of Haji Muhammad Husein) gave the Germans the Deputy Governor’s house to live in and moved out himself. The whole Germau party consisted of about 60 persons, of whom 30 were Bakhtians. Of the two Germans, the younger, short and stout, who signed the telegram sent to Ispahan as Pischer, appeared to be in command of the party, while the other was older and had a beard. The Pmance Agent, Mirza Ghulam Husein, called on the Germans the obtaining fodder,‘ ao. 1 ^ ^ ^ he ^ for them in the way of f !i er o elai Muhamma ?

In the them to go to Shookat’s telegram demanding whence they came and where they were going. The Germans said they did not know themselves where they would go. The Telegraph Master said Shonkat would expect some reply to his enquiry,, to which they answered that they hoped to meet him soon. The day after receiving Shoukat’s telegram, in the evening, both the Germans, accompanied by about 20 sowars, went to the Telegraph Office and sent their reply to Shoukat’s telegram. The same day (the 3rd day after their arrival) they sent a cypher tele gram to Ispahan, which was brought to the Telegraph Office by the Officer in charge of their sowars, Muhammad Khan. The Germans received no reply to their cvpher telegram, but they received some other telegrams en clair addressed*to various persons of their party. The two Germans went out every evening for a walk to different points around the town. They informed people that other parties would arrive shortly from Ispahan and one party would go north to Meshed and another to Birjand. The fifth day after their arrival, the Germans got news of the Kussians advancing to Kain from the north and the same evening themselves went out some° distance on the Khidri road. The same night they engaged six Bazgars with spades and took them out of the city in the direction of Kalata Hail Mir Saiyid Hasan to the north of the city. Their intention is not known, but apparently they had some idea of burying some of their money, ammuni tion, &amp;c., but they are said to have returned after without doing anything in the way of digging. Russians’ arrival—Next morning at 2 a.m. the Telegraph Master heard firing from the town which seemed to last half an hour, after which there was quiet. The Germans with most of their party escaped just leaving four Bakhtiari sowars and all their Arab muleteers sowars and Arabs remained in the town all day and left at course of the day the Germans sent back a sowar who told Beyhud. On arrival at the town the Kussians, whose party consisted of 80 Cossacks, remained about 500 yards from the main gate and sent forward a party of ten Cossacks with an interpreter, and Kerbelai Muhammad Ishaq also went with them. According to the Russian interpreter Kerbelat Muhammad Ishaq did not bring the party to the main gate by a straight road, and they suspected him of treachery. On reaching the gate the ten Cossacks were challenged and fired on by the Germans’ sowars posted on the gate to defend it. Ihey retired to the main party and left Kerbelai Muhammad Ishaq.. The main party of the Cossacks then opened fire and the engagement lasted about half an hour after which the Cossacks withdrew to a Burj about two miles to the north-west o the town from where they moved later on to a Kalata, named Aliabad, a short farsakh west of the town. The Cossacks are said to have had two men wounded and it is probable the casualties occurred among the ten men who advanced quite close to the gate. , Kerbelai Muhammad Ishaq KKed.-When the engagement started Kerbelai Muhammad Ishaq made an attempt to get through a ho e in the wall fnd was accMentally shot, probably by a stray bullet.

After the early morning engagement the Russians remained at Kalata Aliabad the whole day, and it was only the following morning when some of the Cossacks were patrolling they heard that the Germans escaped, some 30 hours after they had fled. Russians’ entry .—The Russians entered the town on the 31st July, and went straight to the big mosque. (This is a very high building in the middle of the town commanding a view of the whole valley and seems of great strategical importance.) The interpreter with the Russians is said to have informed the Officer Commanding that the building was a mosque and they should not enter it, but he insisted. At first they took their horses into the mosque, but when the people raised much objection they removed them. Search .—Immediately after their entry the Russians commenced a house to house search, which continued till the following day. On the second day of their entry the Officer Commanding while at the Telegraph Office was informed that a crowd had assembled outside to complain of the behaviour of the Cossacks. He immediately paraded his men at the mosque and severely reprimanded them. Further he is said to have taken away the Cossacks’ rifles and confined them to barracks (the mosque), or rather those suspected of misbehaviour. One man said his watch had been taken and others that the Cossacks were unnecessarily threatening and frightening the people. Second Russian party arrive .—Two days after the arrival of the Cossacks (80) another party of 40 Cossacks arrived at the city. Their Officer in Com- jnand who seemed to be the senior ordered a fresh house to house search to be made, which seems to have been conducted in a more orderly manner. There are many complaints against the Russian Telegraph Ghulam of Kain, named Muhammad, who assisted the Cossacks and indicated likely houses. This man is accused of having stolen much himself and extorted blackmail from many people. Germans’ baggage .—The heavy baggage the Germans were unable to carry off was found in the house they occupied. The house was locked up and the Russians are said to have got the key from the Rais of Malia. The contents of the boxes found is not known, but it is said there was much money, rifles and auununition, and that each box was marked with the Turkish star and cresent. The Russians had great difficulty in obtaining transport to carry away their loot. They sent two Malia sowars to obtain camels but without success, Eventually they ordered Haji Saiyid Eakhr to procure 20 mules for them. He said he only had one mule but after being detained in the mosque for some time he undertook to collect the mules from various people, which was done. Before leaving the Russians asked Haji Saiyid Fakhr to give them his bill for supplies, over which there was a difference of opinion. The Russians eventually paid Haji Saiyid Rakhr 96 Tumans, but he contends they owe him over 400 Tumans. The Russians beat a few people but in each case there seems to have been • Dried inceme. cause for it. Haji Saiyid Ibrahim was beaten because he swore he had no “Bida”* and it was subsequently found he had a godown full of it. Haji Saiyid Mashum was beaten. He was caught in the act of pricking his mule with a pin to make it restive with the hope that the Russians would discard the animal as unsuitable for transport. Chief Mulla. The Mujtakid of Kain, Haji Saiyid Jowad, visited the Russians in the mosque and requested them to release the prisoners they had; some servants of the deceased Kerbelai Muhammad Ishaq and two men of Hisam-ud-Howleh which they immediately did at the Mulla’s promise to see that they made no mischief. The Mujtahid offered the Russians a present of 50 maunds of barley, but they declined and said they could not take presents.Russians* departure.-^Alter three days’ stay the Russians left, not in a hurry as reported, because for two days they had been trying to obtain trans port. They travelled in the direction of Khidri, and it was thought they were going back to Turbat with the captured loot. Many people complain of having lost valuables and money when the search was made, but many also think the Russian Telegraph Grhulam, Muhammad, who accompanied searching parties, took the opportunity of lining his pockets. Young girl .—A young girl of about 14 years complained of having been violated by two Cossacks, but the Telegraph Master is not inclined to credit the story. Rais Malieh .—The Rais of Malieh, Ghulam Husein Khan, assisted the Germans as much as possible in the way of supplies. He seemed conscious of this and did not go near the Russians. The Russians are said to have taken away the rifles of four Malia sowars, but they were returned soon after. The Russians went to the Malia Office and looked round, but they took nothing. Ghulam Husein Khan is said to have bolted simply because he feared the Russians might hear how he had helped the Germans and befriended them. Appendix B. City Kain, 8th August 1915. STATEMENT OF A CAMELMAN, SISTANI, NAMED MUHAMMAD TAOI, SON OF KERBELAI ALI AKBAR, OF TaGHAZI VILLAGE, SISTAN, CAUGHT AT KAIN TO-DAY. He says he is a servant of Aga Muhammad Mehdi of Sistan. He left Sistan with a big caravan for Yezd and travelled ^ Tabas. At Tabas he met a nartv of Germans who offered him service at Krans 12 per camel per diem, Krans 15 per day personal pay and Krans 5 each per diem to each of h s camelmen. He was badly in debt and was tempted by this offer of service He and three other of his Sistam camelmen with their camels took service* with the German party to come to Kain, and the other members of his Kafla went on to Yezd. (Two of the bistanis caught near Birjand are the servants of this man.) , t n i n +i He savs on arrival at Tabas the Germans were given an Istigbal by the ex-Governor Imad-ul-Mulk, who showed great respect for them and ^d what ex governor xm The Germans told the son of Imad-ul-Mulk that they the Persian* Government for leave to go to Birjand and Sistan to ha nl^ the /a“the British and Russian Consuls.

At Tun tbe Germans met a Persian infantry officer, aged about 25, whom they tngaged on a salary of 50 Inmans a month.On arrival at Kain the Germans sent out the following spies :-—One man, named Mirza Ali Khan, to Birjand (our friend the Saiyid we cought) and another, named Muhammad Husein Bahluli, accompanied by Mirza Agha Tehran! to Herat. - The people of the city of Kain who helped the Germans are— Kerbelai Muhammad. Kerbelai Abuzar (Merchant). (Another) (Butcher). After staying three or four days with the Germans at Kain they sent him (the Sistani) to Turbat with a letter for Khajeh Ibrahim, an Armenian. He delivered the letter to the Armenian who gave it to a German, named Jaegar. The German said he could not understand the letter and that the German party at Kain had not sent him reports as they should have done. They gave him a reply for the Germans at Kain. (This letter was found on the Sistani. I gave the original to M. Samsonoff to whom it is of more importance and kept a copy, attached herewith.) On his return from Turbat he heard at Krimanj (11 farsakhs north of Kain) that the Germans had fled from Kain towards Tun. From Krimanj he went to Beyhud but failed to find the Germans there and he came on to Kain. On the way from Turbat he heard that the Bussians had caught a man, named Haji Agha, son of Haji Mulla Sultan, Gunabadi, and taken him to Turbat as he was a supporter of the Germans. The Sistani was seen near the house we occupied (the same the Germans lived in) and as his actions were rather suspicious we collared him. Appendix O. City Kain, 10th August 1915.

In continuation of my despatch No. 96, regarding the local situation here, and in amplification of the information contained in the Ispahan weekly report No. 33, of the 15th instant, I have now the honour to submit the following items of news : The usual weekly meeting of the clergy took place on Friday evening, 13th instant, this time at the house of Sadr-ul-TJlama. The following members of the clergy were present:— Haji Agha Nourullah, Haji Mirza Muhammad Ali (Kalbazi), Saiyid- ul-Araghein, Mirza Ahmad Doulatabadi, Haji Mirza AbouT Qasim Zanjani. No Bakhtiari Khans were present nor was Jaaferzadah (the German Munshi bashi) though it had been arranged that the latter should be. On the same date the Governor-General, in the course of a conversation on the telephone with Doulatabadi, assured him that the question of changing the Chief of Police (Sultan Mahsoud Khan of the Gendarmerie) had been discussed with Major Killander and a change would shortly be effected. With reference to paragraph 291 of the Ispahan News, No. 33, and to my telegram No. 234 of to-day’s date, I would inform you that the Clergy took very extensive measures to secure a large attendance at the monster meeting convened yesterday morning, 16th August, at the Masjid-i-Nou (and subse quently at Haji Agha Noumllah’s own house), a certain Haji Agha Muham mad Lambani, a wealthy proprietor of the Lumban quarter, and Shukrullah Khan, the head of the “ Democrats ”, being amongst their active Agents ad id* According to the reports received by me of the proceedings at that meet ing, the leading Ulama inveighed chiefly against the Finance Department and the Opium Administration (opium dealers and dallals had mustered in force). Haji Agha Nourullah contented himself with confirming these complaints and summing up to the following effect: “ It is not a question of grievance against this or that particular pub lie office. We have one main complaint. Is there a Government ? Is there a Majlis ? ” I am informed that the telegrams despatched to Tehran at the close of the proceedings were drafted in accordance with this formula. As yet I have not been able to get an authoritative report as to their contents. So far as I have been able to ascertain there were no Bakhtiari Khans present. Sardar-i-Muhtasham calling on me yesterday said that he had declined an invitation to attend the meeting abovementioned but he had empowered Amir-i-Mujahid to seal telegrams on his behalf, adding that there had been nothing of an objectionable nature in these, merely a petition that Persia at this critical moment should not be kept waiting for a Ministry. 278 Telegram P., No. 154, dated (and received) the 23rd September 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to Cox’s telegram to Government of India, No. 2068 B., which repeated substance of your telegram. Prom a military point of view Cox is of course in a far better position to judge expediency of proposed compact with Bakhtiari than I am, and I quite concur as regards political aspect that any agreement would be of great value that could bind tribe more closely to our interests. I feel however grave doubts whether it would be possible within any useful time to negotiate such a compact and in urging that present moment is an opportune one I am inclined to think that Cox has not all facts in present situation before him. He assumes in first place that Amirjang has been appointed Illbegi which is not the case; he is merely acting as such as a temporary arrangement and definite appointment is under discussion still. But Illkhani and Illbegi would pot have power to negotiate compact (of ?) this kind even if definite appoint- inent were made; their authority is limited in practice to internal affairs of tribe and pact of kind suggested would have to be submitted to committee of senior Khans and their assent would have to be obtained. Much time would be lost in discussions between Khans as at this time Khans are scattered. Samsam and Bahadur (latter practically acts for his fast failing father Sardar Assad) are now here, they represent one of chief branches of tribe, and gave very guarded reply when tentatively sounded as to possibility of closer relations with us, and 1 think it extremely unlikely that although they have shown a more satisfactory attitude (during ?) last few days, they will (not ?), without knowledge and approval of Government, abandon their determination to do nothing in their relations with us. They are indeed nervously anxious that they should not be regarded as actively pro-British so much so that they have actually declined to accept money from me which is required to pay forces for which Government have asked them to Tehran and Ispahan and have preferred to find amount themselves, relying of course on my reimburs- ing them later (and then only in shape of loan through Imperial Bank ot Persia! if Government are not able to do so. So long as these two Khans are in (?) this frame of mind it seems to me to be idle (?) to expect that they would agree to a compact with (?) British, the proposed stipulations ot which could not be approved by Government of Persia. From Khans at Ispahan there is even less to be hoped for. Though I scarcely believe that they would take active steps against us, they would be even less willing than Bahadur and Samsem to declare themselves openly with us which by entering into negotiations with us they would have of course to do, as fact could not be^kept quiet. They labour very much under the impression (of German (?) boasts of victory (?) and invincibility (?)] and of the local influence at Ispahan which Germans display of force, and contempt tor Persian authority has achieved. But they after the manner of then; relatives 16 ' ■ course of events and a decisive success on our side would Like rest of Persia they want to be on (?) side w T hich wins. It seems to me that Cox’s proposal offers very slender hopes of success and a safer course 1 think will be to endeavour ( secure ? ) loyalty of Khans bv gifts and promises of more gifts and by guaranteeing to them any expendi ture which they may incur at the request or with assent of Persian Govern ment and I think bv this means that (there is a chance of .) securing something more than ‘their benevolent neutrality without assuming obliga tions which would prove inconvenient hereaftei.

He sugsested that the Consulate Munshi should accompany him to the Hukoumat where, after inter- rogating Sardar-i-Ashjaa and Salar-i-Asliraf, he would sign a document in the iorm drawn up by me, with or without the names of Sardar-i-Ashiaa and Salar-i-Ashraf as circumstances might require. To this I somewhat unwillingly assented. The Munshi returned bringing me a paper in the name of Sardar- i-Jang only. Reflecting that such a document might perhaps fail to satisfy Sardar-i- Jang, I sent my Munshi early the next morning to Amir-i-Mujahid’s garden, w 3 ere His Excellency had been residing for some days, with a few lines saying that the instructions originally received hy me having been to obtain an engagement on the names of all four Khans, I thought it preferable that these instructions should be carried out to the letter. My Munshi having sent me word that His Excellency refused to sign such an engagement, I rode over myself to see the Sardar whom I found in °a verv obstinate frame of mind. On my pointing out that it might create a had impression with you if the first request I made to him on your behalf were refused, His Excellency replied that I might cut off his hands but he would not sign such an engagement in reference to the four Khans mentioned. If it were known in Bakhtiari that he had signed such a document his position would become impossible. No one would obey him. Sooner than do so he would send word to his wife to come back and would resign his appointment. Seeing His Excellency so determined, I suggested that the name of Amir- i-Mufakhkham at least should be added to that of Sardar-i-Jang. This compromise was accepted. With regard to the actual form of the document the proviso inserted by me was the result of representations made to me some time ago by the Sardar- i-Muhtasham to the effect that Sardar-i-Jang’s object in asking for such an undertaking is to be able to continue to afford asylum in his properties at Ram Hormuz or elsewhere to parties inimical to the Sheikh of Mobammerah. On the afternoon of the 21 st August Sardar-i-Jang called on me hy appointment. I conveyed to him your recent complimentary messages which evidently afforded him great satisfaction and reminded him of his former promise to refrain from doing anything to damage Sardar-i-Muhtasham’s position. Sardar-i-Jang effecting to make light of former differences between, himself and Sardar-i-Muhtasham, gave me fresh assurances and I then handed him a copy of the engagement taken from the latter, the original of which is in the Archives of this Consulate. Sardar-i-Jang read this over attentively and put it in his pocket, merely remarking te very well T \ He informed me before parting that he proposes to leave this on or about the 26th August for Kanareh and to stay a short time there with Amir-i- Mufakbkham to whom he had already proposed that they should go together to Tehran. Sardar-i-Jang doubts very much if his brother will be willing to make this journey but looks forward himself to the pleasure of a personal interview with you before long. I have, &amp;c., G. Grahame.

Por following reasons it appears to me quite impossible to negotiate such a compact: (1) Notorious discord among Khans of which evidence is afforded in your telegram No. 2040 B. (2) Present dispersal of Khans. Owing to reasons one and two, for months negotiations would drag on, and I infer that your suggestion is based on present and urgent political and military considerations. Your telegram No. 2040 B. seems to offer me more hope of success than I have entertained hitherto that best course we could adopt in order to secure immediate results is to persevere in policy of endeavouring by means of cash inducements to secure loyal Khans and as soon as X can get into touch with Grahame I would propose to instruct him to use those inducements to best advantage and to keep in as close touch as possible with Muhtasbam.

Your telegram of 20th October. I t appeals ^ to us that the evidence of German intentions to concentrate on Seistan in vf winter may refer rather to what was their original plan than to what they can actually accomplish in view of the presence of our troops in Seistan and Birjand. When the troops now en route arrive we shall have 350 sabres, 600 rifles, with six machine guns, distributed possibly one squadron, one double company, two machine guns, each on Bnjand, Seistan, and Kacha, and should Germany really seem likely to concentrate on Seistan, the Birjand detachment could move to Seistan. But we regard Baghdad as the key to the situation in Persia, and we believe rumours and information as to German intentions in that country to be spread deliberately by Germans with the idea of distracting our attention from Baghdad and causing us to disseminate our forces.

Great quantities of arms and ammunition and, it is said, bombs are being imported and the number of German agents has -been increased considerably. Exact figures are of course not to be obtained but my reports show that Germans in ccrnp^ratively large numbers are constantly arriving and I think in all Persia there cannot be less than 60 Germans, 250 Austrians mostly prisoners of war escapted from Transcaspia and ^perhaps 50 Turks renegade Indians etc., with 80,000 rifles, 7 Dr.8 machine guns bombs etc. Contemptible as this would be elsewhere in Persia with gendarmerie . ■ a. \ entirely and-police probably disaffected and with Yellow Press and all worst elements in enemy pay, it is formidable. Besides which money is being more lavishly spent than ever. This spurt is probably due to fear that Bagdad is about to fall into our hands which event would (?group 'omitted interrupt) their present relatively easy line of communication with Constantinople and also to conjecture that arrival of Grand Duke in the Cau casus may imply more rigorous military measures in4 It' peibia.

In Pars wassmus Is making great efforts to prevent new G overnor of Bushire from taking up his.post. That Germans intend an attempt of sane kind in Teheran seems to be clear from the fact that Swedish C omnandant of Gendarmerie has been enquiring of Ar menians what their attitude would be if Persian Govern ment should declare themselves on the side of one of belligerents or if an attack were made on Christians* Attempt would be certainly made In Hie month Mo harem which begins now when religious fanaticism is easily roused.

Late yesterday afternoon my Eussian colleague and I called by invitation on Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. There was a complete change in their attitude. They professed utmost anxiety to put an end to German propaganda and to protect Consul and almost implored that we should give them financial assistance and arms. In fact they spontaneously offered the assurances which you directed me to demand in your telegram men tioned above. While my Russian colleague took up the attitude that before giving any reply he must first consult bis Government I held out hopes to them that former accommodation could be arranged but as Russian Govern ment were of opinion that it would be impolitic to give financial support for moment I did not feel justified in making definite promise. Until end of war Persian Minister desires moratorium or its equivalent, i.e., about 200,000 Tomans as from January 1st last and 10,000 rifles with ammunition. As regards arms, I believe that we should find it very difficult to supply any to Persian Government at once as those arms which were captured from Turkish forces have already been disposed of and on this point my Russian colleague also does not seem very hopeful. ^ Russian Minister and I are agreed as regards money that it would be politic to at once assent to request and he is telegrahing strongly in this sense to his Government. 1 ie sum which is required by Persian Government each month is less than that which His Majesty’s Government themselves were P re P ared ^ subsidy audit would be an easy enough matter to arrange that 200,000 Tomans per month should be advanced in name of two Governments m guise of a moratorium and should Russian Government agree to share in arrange ment proportion which they would bear could be settled later. Retrospective effect of the moratorium which Government of Persia asks, for involves a sum of about £300,01 G and it would be impossible without giave risk of another run for Imperial Bank of Persia to f nance , 0 P™ tl0 b “ t a t “-ii Russian Minister is however urging his Government to assent to it, but it wiU only he possible to promise Persian Government whole or part of above sum as soon as Banks have made necessary arrangemen s. . n It must not be expected that against Germans y, ers j a “ .^XwaTS b P ablpho do much but moral effect produced might be consideiabie by reason influences, has had to appeal for . ass ^?f C t e en ^ to encourage our friends and to counteract German campaign ; it u ou d attitude of Government has discourage German supporters as hitherto the dual attitude ot govern bppta,.

At the present time at Kerman there is actually only one party. It consists of Zugmeyer and either Lisstock or Greisinger. Ostensibly they have a following to the number of about forty, but they have secretly been recruiting men, who are, it is understood, to turn out at call. A daily news sheet of false war news is published by them ; periodically they spread reports that the Governor has been dismissed and in a general way they are supporting any one who is in opposition to local authorities. That they have directly incited individual crimes I have no reliable evidence to show, but they are inciting people in general against us. pO 235 Translation of a letter from His Majesty the Amir* of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, No. 215, dated the 27th Shawal 1333 Hijra, corresponding to the 8th September 1915.

In this friendly letter Your Excellency has written as follows [His Majesty quotes the whole letter.] I have acquainted myself with all these particulars. As regards the entry of the party mentioned above in the territory of the sublime Government of Afghanistan, I write to say that the Governor of Herat reported the matter to me and asked for fresh instructions. In consideration of the great friendship existing between the two exalted Governments, and the preservation of the neutrality of the sublime God-granted Government of * Amir Habibulla Khan,85 Afghanistan during the present war, I have sent stringent orders to the said Governor enjoining on him to carry out my previous instructions and to send the persons in question to my presence. The Governor will, please God, send p them to me, as directed. When they arrive in my presence, they will of course give vent to the feelings and ideas concealed and reposed in their minds, and I shall understand and know what they have to say and what their intentions are. In any circumstances and in any case Your Excellency may rest assured that, in accordance with the assurances contained in mv letter, dated the 18th Ramazan 1383 Hijra, corresponding to the 31st July 1915, which have given Your Excellency satisfaction, the entry of this party into the territory of the sublime God-granted Government of Afghanistan and the revealment of what is in their minds will, God willing, have no detrimental effect whatever on the attitude of neutrality of the sublime God-granted Government of Afghanistan. As regards Your Excel lency’s statement that you have caused the assurances contained in my friendly letter, dated the 18th Ramazan 1333 Hijra, corresponding to the 31st July 1915, to be brought to the notice of His Majesty the King-Emperor, who will warmly appreciate them, I shall he very grateful if Your Excellency will hereafter intimate and communicate, for my information and for strengthening the relations of friendship between the two Governments, the manner in which His Majesty’s appreciation is made manifest.— Usual ^conclusion* '236 Telegram R., No. 2024 R, dated (and received) the 17th September 1915.

Please refer to Foreign and Political Department’s telegram No. 946 S- Until Germans learn that their deputation to Kabul has been successful, 1 am inclined to think that they do not intend to send any more parties into Afghanistan. If this supposition* is a correct one the only enemies who will be passing within reach of Birjand for some weeks will he individuals between Herat and Ispahan. I requested Colonel Dale to endeavour to close the roa for Paschen, both to the north and to the south of Birjand and informed im that most southern road for Naiband would probably diverge from Dumb, across the hills, which are passable for mules and horses to Sarehah a place which is famous for the number of times Baluchis have raided ^ it. I learn to-day from Sarah that fact of Paschen having gone back is entirely due to excellence of our military dispositions. We have only to watch roads leading to Khur and Naiband under arrangement with Russians. Our troops cannot carry out this arrangement if they are to remain concentrated at Birjand for German travellers who get about twice as quickly as our men who are only mounted on baggage camels. If we had outposts at Sarchah and ur believe we could arrange to get timely news of approach from the west ot any overwhelming force of Germans and that our parties before being attached could concentrate near Khusp. There seems little advantage in keeping a force at Birjand if we are not to attempt to intercept couriers^ We ought, in my opinion, to keep an outpost near Naiband on fastest camels. There is not much fear that the townspeople, who are mostly shop keepers and only keep arms for defence of their town, will attack outpost. A short intervals all down the trade route I would also have scouts who woii carry their information direct to Khur and Sarchah. To-day I hear tha a German doctor was actually concealed in Naiband when Dormer went there. I beg that I may he informed by Government of India whether they desire the column to intercept couriers or not. Some more definite instruction should he sent to Officer Commanding if it is to he done.

They were on the way back to Afghanistan. I hear from two other sources that a dozen Afghans have been purchasing stocks of fodder and grain in various Persian villages between Duroh and Yazdan. They left stocks in Situ. In some villages the Persian Sunnis of Sunnikhana have not sold as they feared that they would incur the Shaukat's displeasure.

This morning I discussed situation in Arabistan with Sheikh of Moham- merah with particular reference to proceedings of German parties and attitude of Bakhtiari Khans. As regards his personal relations with his tribe, viz^ Bani, Tnruf, Chab, Bawi, Muhaisin, he left that his general position was more favourable and satisfactory at the present moment than it has been for five years past. Referring to attitude of Bakhtiaries, he showed me following telegram from Samsam, Tehran, to Ilkhani and Illbegi jointly assuring them that by common consent of Khans as a whole they were assured of undisturbed total enjoyment of their appointments for at least five years to^ come, and were given full power to take necessary steps to control Bakhtiari and Kuhgala under their jurisdiction. Samsam went on to give them stringent and explicit instructions to proceed South as soon as possible and make anange- ments for maintenance of order and security of their boundaries. Second telegram was a lengthy joint message in cypher from Ilkhani and Illbegi, informing Sheikh of the terms of their appointment, welcoming expulsion of Sardar Jang and his brother from council of tribe and then going on to assure Sheikh of their readiness to co-operate with him in their joint affairs and to join him in co-operating with the British. In return they asked for Sheikhs good offices to obtain assurance from us that they would he retained in their appointments for five years. In connec tion with above can any prompt reply by telegraph be conveyed on behalf His Majesty’s Government either by Minister or myself in the above sense. I trust it may he possible. As regards activities of Germans, Sheikh expressed view that such small parties could not move openly with hostile intention without an escort of Bakhtiari sowars and having regard to attitude of Illkhani and Illbegi above- mentioned, he was of opinion that all they would get would be a few adherents of the Sardar Jang to whom friendly Bakhtiari would be opposed. Sheikh considered most they could do would be to break up into twos of threes and disguise themselves and endeavour to incite sympathisers to (commit ?) acts of lawlessness. He agreed that parties needed watching and would assist to that end, hut did not consider that these scattered Germans were good for more than that. I have made arrangements to have an efficient emissary to keep a watch for Germans should they approach low country, and to keep us furnished with prompt information. 249 Telegram P., No. 346, dated the 18th (received 19th) September 1915.

I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning after consultation with my Russian colleague, and told him I believed I could promise that wish oiPersian Governmsnt could lie met so far as montliljr sum of two ^^undrecl* , (?^ thousand tomans was concerned but that financial difficulties in the way would delay operation as regards sum accruing since beginning of year. I also told Minister for Foreign Affairs that both my Russian colleague and I were some what concerned (at ?) prospect of seeing whole gendarmerie force of Persia concentrated at capital, for the characteristic of this force was well known to Persian Government, who must see that it would give Germans upper hand in Tehran. And we must have full assurances that Persian Government would prevent it before going further into the question of a moratorium. Minister for Foreign Affairs began by feigning ignorance of the orders which were given by Commandant, but finally he admitted fact to be true. He gave me a promise that Commandant would be asked to furnish an explan ation and said that Commandant ought to be dismissed if his reply was unsatis factory. He complained to me that Swedes as a whole behaved in a manner which gave impression that they were independent of Persian Government. I strongly urged on Minister for Foreign Affairs that he should get Com mandant dismissed. I think it is not impossible that under our proposals we might get rid of some of Swedes, for instance Commandant of gendarmerie and Sonessen, who is known to have supplied German Vice-Consul, Kermanshah, with a machine gun for the purpose of attack at Kangavar (on ?) two Consuls. As regards Sonessen, we should be justified (in ?) making official demand for his dismissal. It was explained to me by Minister for Foreign Affairs that request of Persian Government was that moratorium should take effect as from beginning of Persian year so that total sum would be not million eight hundred thousand tomans but million two hundred thousand.

I replied that (such ? ) a step would require careful consideration as it would be great innovation in our policy in Persia. The agents repeatedly pressed for an early answer. . I am inclined to the belief that this step indicates that Soulet is being urged by German emissaries to join them in working against us, Uiough his agents naturally asserted that he has consistently turned a deaf ear to all their overtures They admit that the man Pugin was very active in dress of Sunni viHao-er in ^neighbourhood of Kumisheh.

The following has been received from Minister at Tehran No. 295, dated September 17th. Your telegram No. 1961 B. Attitude of Government and of Shah has undergone a marked change ; thev are genuinely alarmed at danger into which Persia has been thrown by their toleration of German intrigues and now are sincerely desirous of undoing the harm which has been done. But position of Persian Government is very week. With an irresolute if well meaning Prime Minister who by reason of his present policy is brought into conflict with pro-German democrats and with gendarmerie frankly pro-German in attitude Persian Government are powerless at present to take effective measures. Por four months gendar merie has not been paid and Commandant is said to have ordered entire force throughout Persia to come to Tehran in order to enforce payment of their salaries, and His Majesty’s Consul Shiraz has been told by a Swedish Officer at Shiraz that similar order has been passed as regards the province of Pars also. It is obvious that gendarmerie could be used for German purposes if they are concentrated at Tehran. It may be only bluff however. At Kasvin there are only 3,200 Bussian troops and there seems little pros pect of more being sent. Persian Government has asked us to give them 200,000 tomans a month in form of suspension of services of Russian and British advances and loans which is to take effect as from January 1st last. My Russian colleague and I have recommended scheme to our respective Governments so far as monthly instalments is concerned with promise to advance large sum accru ing in respect of first eight months of the year, or a part of it, as soon as Imperial Bank of Persia can without risk of a run on Bank finance operation. We think that very considerable moral effect night be produced by nominally democratic Government being forced to apply to us for money. Attempt to buy over the Bakhtiari to our side has proved a failure. Khans here are not unfriendly nor have they opened their mouths very wide. In my opinion they have been overborne by their relations at Ispahan who not only were impressed by display of force and vigour and money of Germans, but who did not care to tacide German “ Army ” with its machine guns as we might have required them to do. Confidential. My private opinion is also that his invincible mistrust of Bakhtiaris made Bristow too cautious about spending money upon them. I incline to belief that while Khans will not do much for us, possibly nothing at all, they will certainly not side in an active way with the enemy* and that they believe that our having to depend on them to protect oil fields will force us in future to overlook any present infidelities on their part. Our policy would seem to be to prevent any alliance between them (and ?) Kashgais and to keep on as good terms with them as we can. Aipong minor Khans of Kashgai tribe I hear German agents are very active but not actually with Soulet.91 255 Telegram P., No. 5 F., dated (and received) tie 19th September 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kam, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depait- ment, Simla. Please see telegram 955 S., dated September 17th, from the Government f India in the Poreign and Political Department. I had no evidence which lad not already reached Government of India from various places m Persia, at ime of despatching my telegram 210 C.B2 T think however that my opinion is founded on fair deduction and not mere surmise. The salient facts which are on record I will now mention- m On June 26th I learnt from His Majesty’s Minister that one party of Germans had left Ispahan for Birjand and Tabas and that another party had left Yazd for Kerman. (2) From time to time other parties have arrived in Kerman. (3) Germans in Kerman have been tampering with Sistani traders and asking them to co-operate with them, when they approach Sistan this winter (in this connection see my telegram 12 F.). (4) Daud Khan, a German emissary, was arrested on road to Bam by Governor-General, Kerman. (5) About August 15th a letter was intercepted by British Agent, Turbat- i-Haidari The writer was a German in charge of operations having their base in Tabas. The scheme of the Germans, which he adumbrates, appears to be that first step is for a deputation to enter Afghanistan, and that subsequently his own contingent and an Afghan force should co-operate against Meshed. The conjecture does not seem unreasonable that Kerman supervisor of operations in south hopes similarly that Afghans will co-operate against Sistan in the first instance and then British Baluchistan. (6) A large party escorted by 80 Europeans on September 1st was being prepared in Ispahan for despatch in an eastward direction. While there is a chance of their being interned there I doubt the probability of this party entering Afghanistan. (7) Large parties left Ispahan on September 6th, September 7th» September 8th “ ostensibly making for Kerman but in all probability for Sistan.” (8) See Ispahan telegram, September 8th. Herr Nidermayer seems to have been formerly nominated as German Consul for Sistan. (9) On September 10th I heard unofficially from local Bank Manager that all Englishmen were about to take their departure from Ispahan for Ahwaz. (10) Reinforcements from Kermanshah are still reaching Ispahan. Germans, it seems to me, have an easy task to clear all Central Persian cities of Englishmen. After Ispahan, Germans will make Yazd, Kerman and smaller telegraph stations too hot for them. Bunder Abbas can be afforded protection from His Majesty’s ships. Bunder Abbas is probably not their objective. Undoubtedly it is German aspiration to lead an army of Afghans into India. Is it conceivable that they will leave Sistan untouched on way ? Moreover Sistan once in their possession can be used as a lever in two ways. It will be made over to Amir of Afghanistan as a gwd g'wo for alliance. It will he taken away from Persian Government if she continues to observe an attitude of neutrality. I have received following news subsequent to despatch of my telegram No. 210 C.: — (1) Paschen has made arrangements for collection of supplies down the Persian-Afghan Frontier for a long distance, (2) one or more Germans have been lurking in Naiband and it is within the bounds of possibility that they are trying to enter into communication with Sistan. At present I am pre cluded from interfering with operations of Germans over there. Our force in Sistan is dangerously week in my opinion. We ought, I think, to hold the whole trade route in great strength np to Meshed, not only because telegraph line is an important factor, hut also because a natural line of defence is offered to us by the presence of “ Lut” across which, if we hold five or six points strongly, no German invasions should succeed. We should at the same time have to be on the alert for attacks from south and east. Repeated to Tehran.Telegram P., No. 350 F., dated (and received) the 20th September 1915.

Consul, Shiraz, urges earnestly that Soulet be accorded protection as “ if we are to remain in Southern Persia there is no alternative, and if we do not make arrangements with Soulet, Germans will seize opportunity to do so and could make our position untenable”. As ex-Governor-General and democrats are hatching a plot which is to he put into execution by help of gendarmerie, he describes situation as very critical. As no mention is made by Consul of Kawam, I presume Consul does no anticipate that there will be any immediate objections from him.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Ali Akbar Beg Tavildar of Hissam-ud-Daulah and Ali Khan, son of Mir Husain .Sultan, are the two men who gave Germans most help in Kainat. Both these men live in the vicinity of Sarah and both of^them sent letters to Shaukat after Germans had crossed the frontier. _ I am inclined to suspect Ali Khan of forwarding a letter from Germans in which Governor was threatened. I received information on September 12th that replies to both men had just been sent by Governor. Ali Khan had in the meantime gone down to Sistan. For two or three days from September 7th Paschen made the house of Ali Khan his headquarters, but at the time the owner was certainly in Sistan. Vice-Consul, Sistan, was recently instructed by me to keep a lookout for Ali Khan, and to advise Officer Commanding if possible to arrest him as I did not think that Deputy Governor could be trusted to do it. I sent communication to Shaukat on September 18th remonstrating with him (1) for permitting 12 Afghan sowars to make a halt at Yazdan in Persian territory, while Paschen was here. (2) For permitting Paschen and his Afghan Agents in the border villages to purchase stocks of grain. (8) For not inflicting punishment on Ali Khan and Ali Akbar for their services to Germans. His Excellency in his reply states that he has no knowledge of (1) and (2) ; that he does not know Ali Khan and that he cannot punish Ali Akbar because he is a servant of Hisam ! I heard from Vice-Consul, Sistan, yesterday that in house close to that of Deputy Governor Ali Khan had been located. Twenty sepoys attempted to form cordon round the house. They were able to apprehend four men but one managed to get away over a wall. These men were taken for examination to Consulate and released when not identified.95 1V , A „ remonstrance was sent by Deputy Governor to Vice-Consul savins that aii his soldiers were in a ferment and that they would have created troublf but they had no ammunition fortunately, as they were about to be paid their wages, and their cartridges had been returned into store for check He added that Ah Khan was in Sardar Khudadad Khan’s village This we know is not true. &amp; * Vice-Consul was also informed by the Chief of Police that a large number of soldiers m Sistan (who are all Kainis) are of family of Mir Husain Sultan. It thus becomes clear that Germans possibly have commenced intriguing with most formidable Baluch Sardar and are also trying to suborn all the Persian troops in Sistan. 269 Telegram R., No. 3113 B., dated (and received) the 22nd September 1915.

Shortly before 5 a.m. to-day I left this Consulate on horseback accompanied by two mounted men of my Escort viz Chowdri Khan and Painda Khan. (Since 23rd August in deference to the particular request of the Native Officer, I have been riding in the early mornings with two orderlies - both armed with rifles - instead of by one only as theretofore.)' I rode down the Hospital lane turned to the right, crossed the river bed near the Mar no on bridge, rode through the woods on the south side of the river and on arriving at the point where the road to Julfa joins the path along the river, I ordered Painda Khan to go up to the Telegraph Office and bring down to the Consulate a telegram, the arrival of which had been notified to me by telephone the previous evening. It was then a quarter to six by my watch which is about a quarter of an hour fast by telegraph time. I rode across the river bed Chowdri Khari riding a little distance in the rear. It was just 5.50 by my watch when I turned into the'Hospital lane. I trotted, ohowdri following me. Just before reaching a spot where this lane takes a slight bend I saw a man walking before me in the middle of the path going towards the Hospital. He was wearing a- long darkish blue 'sardari', trousers of some lighter colour and a black 'kolah” of medium height. He waswas of medium stature# Caen I had approached within a short distance perhaps five or six yards of him, he suddenly turned his head and looked at me over his right shoulder# I caught a glimpse of a sallow, dirty looking, half shaven face with thick eyebrows# He turned right about;and stepped to the side of the path on my left. I suddenly saw his arm. raised, heard a shot and felt a twinge under my left arm f I turned my head to the left saw him moving towards the direction of Chowdri Khan, stop turn for a moment towards me as if doubtful whether to fire on me again or go for Chowdri Khan# My horse frightened had broken from the trot into a canter# I turned the bend in the lane and just after doing so saw a tallish man with a thick moustach and a clear complexion, apparently going towards the Hospital, who as I passed him at the canter, raised both arms as if to give a signal to some one unseen. Suspecting that confederates might be waiting for me at the cross road a few yards further on leading to the Hospital, I put my horse to the full gallop (just as I passed this latter individual I heard three shots fired - presumably on Chowdri Khan. I slackened my gallop a little as I passed a policeman standing near the Police office close to the Bazarche PaC^asr calling to him. to go and assist my man. Galloping on I entered the Khiavan i Koush and gave a similar warning to a policeman standing there. I also saw one of the Indian sowars (Peroze Khan) whom 1 told to run to the Resaidsr ana get help for Chowdri Khan# On arriving at the door of the Consulate I ordered assistance to be sent at once to Chowdri Khan.'CIDBNT OF 2nd SEPTEMBER 1915, TATEMENT No *2 • I I S E A H A.N, 6th September 1915• In continuation of the account taken down from my dictation on September of the incident of that date in so far as I v/as personally concerned in it or cognizant thereof, I now give herebelow a brief statement of the lattet part of this incident compiled by me from information verbally given to me by Major Killander and others in the course of various visits paid to me by him and others between 3rd and 5th September inclusive and from a written report furnished by Dr* Aganoor, British Vice Consul at Isfahan under date of 3rd instant. Seven shots in all were heard from the C.M.S. Hospital situated about 400 yards from the spot, viz one shot, then an interval, then three shots in rapid succession, then three more shots in rapid succession. The first shot was of course that fi^ed on me: the subsequent shots would appear to have been fired not by the man who fired on me but by two others who were lurking about the lane, possibly under cover of partially broken down wall on the west side of it. It has been stated by one informant that two of these three men were wearing German badges. Hews of Chowdri Khan's death was brought to me while „ , o-incr dressed by the doctors about 7 a.m. ijiy wounds were being aresscu Subsequently I learned (from the native Officer) that oo„ar Chowdri Khan had not been able to fire in self defence. I attach the statement of Resaidar Rad Sawaz Khan, XI E . E .o. Lancers regarding the final phase of this incident.r ISFAHAN, 6th. September 1915. From Resaidar Malik Rat Fawaz Khan, To His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General. On 2nd September in the morning when I was getting ready for parade, Dafadar Shahbud din Khan reported to me that some one had fired upon and wounded His Britannic Majesty’s Consul General and Sowar Chowdri Khan. I immediately ordered my men to fall in. I went to the Consulate gate and at that very moment the Consul General reached the Consulate, informing me that Chowdri Khan had been fired on and Sowar Painda Khan had been sent to Telegraph Office and orders were given to search for Sowars Painda Khan and Chowdri Khan. Sowar Khan Mohamed Khan was the first to be ready at the gate and to ask permission to go and search for Sowar Chowdri Khan and having obtained permission he left the Consulate all alone. The rest of the Sowars were divided into two and sent out to search for Chowdri Khan. Sowar Khan Mohamed Khan regardless of dangers, had already found Sowar Chowdri Khan, wounded, though still alive and had lifted hiiji up in his arms. Sowar Chowdri Khan had asked hup, 'I am done for, but where and how is the Consul Genera^?'. Bowar Khan Mohamed Khan had replied that the Consul General was slightly wounded hut safe in the Consulate. On hearing that the Consul General was safe, Sowar Chowdri Khan could only thank and praise God and said 'Ho matter if I die so long as the Consul General is safe”. TiieI i I 7 ' ' • .

The searching parties reported that on their arrival at the Hospital Chowdri Khan had already died. Khan Mohamed Khan states that when he reached the spot where Chowdri Khan had fallen, he saw three men, armed with pistols, some 100 yards away. On seeing him. they moved as if they wished to return hut as at that time the sun hah already risen and there were men passing up and down the road, they went on, apparently fearing that men would he in pursuit hy then.

Colonel GushchinTas declined to send Cossacks to Khur. Both Colonel Haig and myself have heard that in vicinity of Tabas two or three Germans are lurking, who are still holding communication with west and Afghanistan. X am informed that some of the Germans who joined mission into Afghanistan came by Naiband route. ^ The road to Tabas from Naiband is quite open to Germans at present. The road to Sistan from Naiband is via Garmab Sarichah (see map Volumes one and four, “ Routes in Persia ”). Colonel Dale has received orders from Colonel Wikeley to advance to Khusp from fNeh. I shall meet Dale at Khusp. In your opinion is it necessary that any special (arrangements ?) should he made to cut German communication between Tabas and Naiband ? If so, orders should be sent to Colonel Gushchin through Russian Legation at Tehran to arrange with Colonel Dale. Por their support of Germans I would like to see Imad-ul-Mulk and his son Imad-ul-Mamalik receive severe punish ment, but I do not know if it is possible to punish them with force which we have at our disposal. It is not difficult, I understand, to block ail roads leading to the town of Naiband, although place itself cannot be reduced (without ?) a field gun. We ought also to put a stop to caravans taken supplies to Naiband from Kainat. In regard to this can we ignore objections of local authorities? Shaukat-ul-Mulk naively said to me 10 days ago that he was in correspondence with Imad-ul-Mulk and that latter would certainly let him know about any more German parties which might intend to enter Kainat region.

I am informed by Colonel Wikeley who is commanding the troops at Sistan that some time ago he recommended that two mountain guns should be attached to his force. In view of possibility of Sarhaddis making trouble this winter under German influence, and of great difficulty in attacking fort-like Persian villages without artillery, I beg strongly to support the recommendation. Both Colonel Wikeley and I believe that very great moral effect will be created by such addition. If possible I would like to see a larger number of guns supplied to troops.

As long as Cabinet remained passive, Persia believed that it approved of the German propaganda against two Powers. With regard to question of Bushire he urged strongly the withdrawal of our troops from that quarter. I replied that Prime Minister and I had talked matter over and that i declined absolutely to recede from the arrangement offered yesterday to His Highness. Again His Excellency appealed to us for money. This afternoon a visit has been arranged between the Shah and the Bussian Minister.

From— His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Urgent. The conversation which the Russian Minister had with His Majesty the Shah of Persia yesterday was not satisfactory. Shah seems to be somewhat under influence of enemy. Russian Minister and I are of opinion after a long and careful consideration that an attempt at Ispahan following on other attacks on our Consul(s) discloses a state of affairs that demands strong action without delay on the part of British and Russian Governments. It is plain that object of enemy is to bring about a rupture of relations between Persian Government and the two Powers by infamies of this kind so as to enable enemies to announce union of two Islamic peoples. No action whatever is taken by Persian Government to restrain German proceedings or even to influence public opinion against them; Government's one idea on the contrary is to use Germans as a means to squeeze us unless we can bring some kind of pressure to bear on them and offer them substantial inducements also. If we applied pressure in the nature of say occupation of another port, such action would defeat its own object, because it will only (provide ?) Germans with another pretext to inflame public feeling against us as in the case of Bushire. Unless numbers of Russian troops at Kasvin are very greatly augmented say up to 15,000 men same considerations would also apply to their being used, and even if Russian troops were available there is no time for this. Only course wUich is left to us (is to ?) offer Persian Government the choice of declaring herself on our side or on the side of enemy. It would be insufficient to ask (?) Persia to break off relations with the enemy Powers ; distinction is of too subtle a nature for the average Persian intellect to grasp and step would be so signal a one as to leave no room for doubt or half measures. If Persian Government wants to join us, she must make a declaration of war on enemy Powers and we would in that case agree to moratorium from now to be in force until say three years after the conclu sion of the war. In contrary case the British and Russian Legations would leave the country at once holding Persian Ministers responsible for safety of our Consuls and colonies on their journey, for safety of any of our nationals who wished to stay back and for safety of all British and Russian property in Persia. . , . , , Persian Government would be allowed say 48 hours in which to arrive at a decision. # i n • n Mv Russian colleague and I believe there is a chance that Persian Gov- eminent would accept-these terms though that Government would very likely stipulate for military assistance, for a sum of money to he paid down, for a59 guarantee of territorial integrity at end of war, and for eventual mmovzX from Persia of all foreign troops: some or all of these points would be stipulated for by Persia. It is a matter for Allied Powers to decide whether their interests which are at stake make some such arrangement as that defined above necessary or ? desirable, but unless some very drastic measure is taken or a, decisive military success occurs to shake Persian belief in German powers invincibility Russian Minister and I are agreed that we shall not be able to remain mucn longer m Tehran and it at least (will?) be less damaging to prestige of our respective Governments for us to leave Persia by our own doing than to be compelled to do so. Belgian and Prench Ministers are in accord with these views and latter has wired to his Government that situation is becoming critical in Persia. A message identical with foregoing is being sent by Russian Minister to Petrograd. If Persian Government declares for us, enemy missions will probably make for Ispahan, and grave disorders may ensue if they succeed, though I do not think that these disorders would last very long if Persian Government had plenty of money to use among tribes. At Shiraz and Ispahan there would be some danger for Consul and colonies and former would have to depend on Kawam for assistance and latter on Bakhtiari Khans. I do not think there would be much danger elsewhere. In the event of our proposals (not ?) being (accepted ?) by Persian Government, I presume policy which is laid down in Government of India’s telegram No. 483, dated May 15th, would hold good, while in regard to our troops in the east of Persia, British and Russian Governments would decide whether operations should be carried on or not.

Wonderful tales are being circulated by Germans of their having marched across Persia and having defeated British at Bunder Abbas and some people are kissing hands of the party and otherwise behaving in a foolish manner, but public opinion in favour of the visitors is by no means unanimous. Kandahari and Kabuli sepoys are at present pro-German, but the Herat! sepoys are unanimously inclined for quietness and peace and it may be hoped wiser counsels will prevail among all. If other parties of Germans and Austrians can be prevented from crossing frontier into Afghanistan this one should soon lose credit with the people. The judicious expenditure of a little money in Herat should have a good effect, and I have taken steps to have this done. Telegram P., No. 2 F., dated (and received) the 5th September 1915.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 244 regarding Bushire. This morning I saw the Prime Minister. I said that as anticipated by me the solution he had suggested could not be accepted by His Majesty’s Government, hut I was glad to know that a proposal practically indentical with one I now brought with me had been put forward by the Persian Minister in London. The dismissal of the Governor-General of Pars as a necessary condition of the restoration of Persian Civil authority in Bushire was agreed to by His Highness without very serious demur, hut he then boggled over the punish ment of the Khans and insisted that our troops should be withdrawn at an early date. He would not promise that further punishment should be meted out to the Tufangchis who had actually taken part in attack and in regard to the Khans who were responsible for it he would give no kind of promise. As regards the troops he said they must he withdrawn in order to appease public opinion. The news of an attempt on the life of the Consul-General at Ispahan was received by me at about this point. I at once communicated the information to His Excellency and pointed out to him that the public opinion he wished to placate was that which had brought about occurrences such as this. It was the opinion aroused and paid for by German gold and to his making any concession to it I could not consent. Until all danger was past the British troops must remain. Gendarmes would, His Excellency said, be sent to which I replied that he was setting wolves to guard His Majesty’s llepresentative and that the suggestion would not be entertained for a moment. Especially in view of the attack on the Consul-General I consider His Excel lency’s objections as tantamount to a refusal to give us any satisfaction and as an indication that there is no intention on the part of the Persian Govern*- ment to carry out the policy of neutrality which they have so often proclaimed and I regret to have to telegraph to this effect to you. The attempt at Ispahan was, I warned His Excellency, the fourth of a series of attempts on the Consular Officers of the two Powers for which no adequate satisfaction had as yet been given. It revealed a most serious situation and the Persian Government had now to make the choice as to whether or not they were going to permit the achievement by the Germans of their object of making our position here impossible. Should it be decided by His Excellency now not to give us very moderate satisfaction circumstances required that we should draw our own conclusions from his attitude, viz., that Persian Government contem plated the possibility of relations being broken off between Persia and her two neighbours without serious misgiving. Without consulting his Colleague His Excellency said he could not give a reply.

It should be clearly understood that the object of sending troops to Sistan is merely to counteract the influence of the Germans and, it possible, to intercept their parties where this can be done with reason able hope of success ; but that there must be no idea of attacking Persian subjects who show sympathy for the Germans or Persian towns. By such action a situation might arise with which our force would be quite inadequate to deal. At Tehran the situation is very critical, and if relations are broken off with the Persian Government, the question of our future action in Sistan will have to be very carefully considered.

From— His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Clear the line. Urgent. Please refer to telegram from Government of India No. 912 S., dated 6th September. My Bussian colleague and I have had in mind constantly the importance which Afghan and Indian consider ations possess in relation to the Persian problem and the proposals we thought out were framed entirely with a view to hold up situation m Persia. That there is no small element of chance involved in proposal must be readily admitted but how policy of drift which Government of India advocates can meet the difficulty I entirely fail to see. Every day the Germans are strengthening their position here and by employing same methods as those which they have resorted to at Ispahan, could even now render our position impossible. The question therefore is not one of drifting but of how long our enemies will stay their hand and it is scarcely to be hoped that Germans will wait for the occurrence of some signal success to alter position such as forcing of Dardanelles. What would be much more to the purpose w^ould be the capture of Baghdad in my opinion. An alternative course lies open to us, but it seems to me to labour under same disadvantages as to the policy of drift which has been suggested. That course w r ould be for us to inform Government of Persia that we are prepared to give them support which they are always hinting at, viz., arms and money or in other words to confess to surrender on our part and allow ourselves to be blackmailed mercilessly. We should ask Persian Government in return to close the Mejlis, suppress hostilities, newspapers, &amp;c., and at first sign of such action on part of Persian Government, Germans would strike their blow. That Persian Gov ernment will go to considerable lengths to prevent the British and Russian Legations from leaving Tehran is (as a) matter of fact only element of present situation in our favour. Germans are endeavouring to overcome even this reluctance and two inopportune incidents have just taken place which are calculated to assist German policy as they will give Germans further ground for exciting Persian opinion. The first of these incidents is the landing to-day at Enzeli of a Russian regiment, a force w r hich is insufficient to command respect but whose advent is provocative. The second incident is the intentional deportation of Turkish Consul-General, Resht, but Russian Minister tells me he will use his efforts to get orders sent from Caucasus. Indian Government consider our proposal involves playing game which Germany wants; on the contrary we see game is already in hands of Germans and we believe in the course which we suggest, by utilizing only element of situation that is favourable and promising financial assistance at same time and other inducements (for ?) pulling chestnuts out of the fire which we have offered to Persia. Chance of its being a success is but a small one, for I can scarcely believe when moment comes so flabby Minister as Mustaufi would find courage put his name to a declaration of war against Germany, to say nothing of Turkey, in spite of half hints from Persian Government that they would at a price become our allies. At the present moment disposition of Persian Government towards us may be gauged by fact that I have just received from Minister for Foreign Affairs verbal message that Persian Government reject our proposal to settle Bushire question, and prior to recall (of) Governor-General, Ears, insist on hoisting of Persian flag at Bushire.64 1 however our respective Governments decide against our proposals I subm.t that we should at least try to induce Persian Government by K ivlne them assistance in money and arms which they ask for ratoer than adopt a policy c£ dntt and an ever (increase ?)ing drift. Sooner or later this wifi of uomse involve settlement of Bushire question on Persian terms, but it offers a slight chance on the other hand of inducing Persian Government not to tacitly encourage pro-Cxerman teelmg in country. J It may however just as well have a contrary effect as it will show Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government are wholly dependent on goodwill of Persia. * * o Initial money inducement will have to he large, and will he necessarily limited by power (to) Imperial Bank of Persia to make advance. Advance must^ also be given immediately and without waiting for concurrence of Russian Government. Addressed to Foreign Office; sent to Government of India, Sir P.

A f the request of the Prime Minister I called on him this Clear the At the q ^ to tbe following agreement with him. ^rirbr;^ T Acting e = ^t^ir^Tylatr-The name oiVe person selected will hecommunicated to me by the Persian Government and I am to transmit it to the Military authorities (?) at Bushire by whom the administration will be made over to him. The Persian flag will then be re-hoisted. In order to ensure the safety of Consulate and community the troops will remain as long as required. An undertaking is given by the Persian Government to punish the guilty Khans and to endeavour to put an end to the intrigues of the German but they express hope we shall not insist with excessive severity (?) on former point. About the indemnity nothing was said but I consider it as accepted tacitly. I shall be grateful if necessary instructions are conveyed to the Military authorities at Bushire, if this arrangement is approved of by you. The landing of Russian troops at Enzeli is very largely responsible for this surrender on the part of Persian Government.
