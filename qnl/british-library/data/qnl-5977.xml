Confidential . D.O. No. C/281-4/9 2. I have examined my records and I can find no corres- ponlence other than that quoted hy you in your Express Letter under reference that throws any light on this subject. The lease of the Bandar Shuwaikh area was terminated on 14th July, 1922, in accordance with article III of the agreement. The termination of a lease normally means the immediate cancellation of any conditions which may be binding on the parties to that lease unless there is a specific clause in the lease, or it is clearly expressed in the clause allowing for the termination of the lease, that certain specific conditions shall continue to have effect after the termination of the lease. There is no such provision in the Bandar Shuwaikh document, further, in Major More’s letter to Shaikh Ahmad dated July 14th 1922, no phrase occurs which in any way indicates that we considered clause X still in force nor have I seen any communication on this subject which has been made since that date. I have consulted His Highness * Secretary unofficial ly and he has informed me that the Kuwait Government have no record of any letter from us expressing the view that clause X of the agreement is still in force. The Hon’ble Lt-Col. N.B.

I shall be grateful if I may be furnished with a copy of this document before I make the communication ordered in your letter under reference for I anticipate that His Highness may deny that any obligation exists as the Agreement ceased to be an effective instrument in 1922 and I would like to be in possession of all the facts so that I can convince him immediately that such is not the case and that he is still bound by clause X. -CV Yours sincerely,i &gt; Telegram From To political Agent, Kuwait, No. T/338 Uated 21st received 23rd April 1942.

After Compliments, Ref. to our discussion of 30th April,1942,I wish to inform four Excellency that as my country needs some improvments and owin^ to the mo dern urgent necessities, I decided to increase the Custom Duty charged on both the import and export to &amp; from Kuwait ,from^5i %\ to 6-£ ^as from 25th November 194/. The real reason for this increase of duty is to use the c- extra charge for the betterment of Health and Educational Institutions. This simple duty is enforced equally on all merchants exporting and importing, both those who reside in Kuwait and those living abroad ***5 and have trade communication with Kuwait,exe;t some private goods imported by some prominent Brtishers living in this country. I am very glad to inform Your Excellency that Health and Educatio nal Institution* are offering their services free to all peple residing m Kuwait,what ever their nationality may be. It is therefore,necessary tnat foreign merchants should not receive a special treatment which will* distinguish them from Kuwaities and which .ill mean inquity in respect of the public. I am quite certain that H.M.’s Govt, will agree to this and will not ask any exemption to her subjects from this rule,in order to protect her friends’ rights,especially as we wittness how she encourages and helps the charity schemes whenever she gets the chance to do so. I hope that Your Excellency will communicate with the authorities concerned informing them the real reason for the the increase of duty and I believe that this step will meet with the approval of H.M’s Govt.and the Hon’ble the Political Resident and Your Excellency’s as well.

Prom Major T. Hickinljotham, O.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Honourable the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to recall our conversation of the 12th May at Bushire and to enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. 2. On the 21st August 1907 an Agreement was signed between the representative of His Majesty’s Government in Kuwait and the Shaikh of Kuwait which provided for the occupation by His Majesty’s Government of a considerable area of land at Bandar Shuwaikh, some two miles from Kuwait town, in return for an annual payment in the form of rent by His Majesty’s Government to the Shaikh of Hs. 60,000. As is usual in such Agreements there were various subsidiary clauses some of no moment and some of considerable importance; among these latter there are three of which special mention must be made. Clause 5 by which in H consider- ation of the rent” the Shaikh of Kuwait re-affirmed his former promise not to lease or otherwise alienate any part of his territory to any foreign power without His Majesty’s Government*! permission, Clause 9 by which His Majesty’s Government recognised that the town of Kuwait and its boundaries were the property of the then Shaikh and his heirs and agreed not to levy Customs dues in the leased area or in any area to be leased in the future, and Clause 10 by which •’in consideration;v 4 8 consideration of the above promise' (note that Clause 10 follows immediately below Clause 9) the Shailch binds himself and his heirs not to levy Customs dues on goods imported or exported by British subjects in excess of 4% on the invoice value of the goods at the port of export. 3. On the 14th July 1922 the Shaikh was informed that His Majesty’s Government had no further use for the land leased under the 1907 Agreement and that the lease would be terminated in accordance with Clause 3 of that Agreement. Ihe lease was terminated and His Majesty’s Government ceased to pay the rent, in fact they went further and persuaded the Shaikh to refund such of the rent as had been paid by error in advance before the termination of the Agreement. It is therefore somewhat surprising to hear that although His Majesty’s Government do not consider that they have any longer any rights in the Bandar Shuwaikh lands and most certainly do not consider themselves liable for any monetary payment in the form of rent or otherwise they do consider the three clauses mentioned in paragraph 2 of this despatch as still in force and binding on the original parties to the Agreement. This attitude is legally unsound for the termination of the Agreement meant the immediate cancellation of any conditions which were binding on the parties to the Agreement by virtue of that Agreement unless there was some specific clause in the Agreement which provided for the continuance beyond the life of the Agreement of any or all of the conditions binding on one or the other or both of the parties to the Agreement or it was clearly expressed by both parties when the Agreement was terminated that certain conditions should continue to have effect after the termination of the Agreement. There was no such clause in the Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement nor were any conditions laid down with regard to Clauses 5, 9 and 10 when the Agreement was terminated.\ V © ^ ^ 3. 4. An examination of the three clauses referred to in paragraph 2 of this despatch is enlightening. Clause 5 clearly and categorically states 'in consideration of the rent', the rent has ceased and with it the consideration therefore as far as this Agreement is concerned the ^haildi niay dispose of his property as he likes hut fortunately for His Majesty’s Government Clause 5 was only a re-affirmation of the 1899 undertaking which is still binding on the Shaikh and his heirs. Clauses 9 and 10 must he considered together for one is dependent on the other hut not I venture to suggest in the way that Sir Gilbert Laithwaite has Indicated in paragraph 2 of his note, India Office ^o. 427 P.'S. 6535/33. In my opinion Shaikh Mubarak did not give his undertaking in regard to Customs dues in return for His Majesty’s Government’s recognition of the town of Kuwait as his and his heirs property hut with reference to the last part of Clause 9 by which His Majesty’s Government agreed not to levy any Customs dues in the leased area and in return tne Shaikh agreed not to tax unduly British subjects in his area, a very suitable and appropriate arrangement. Faturally when we cease to lease the area we are no longer in a position to levy dues and any reciprocal arrangement must be considered as null and void and no longer binding. The vague promise made in regard to the town of Kuwait etc., belonging to the Shaikh and his heirs is just as void as the rest of the Agreement and its place was taken before the termination of the Agreement by the 1914 undertaking by which His Majesty’s Government recognised and admitted that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait is an independent Government under British protection. A much more clear and definite statement. 5. Prior to the 1st of April 1931 the Customs dues were4 were 4# ad valorem for British and Kuwait subjects alike but on that date the Kuwait Government decided to raise the dues to 4| per cent to offset a loss caused by the abolition of a house tax, 7ive years later in 1936 a further rise was ordered and yet another on the 1st January 1941 ;vhile on the 23rd November 1941 the Kuwait Government decided that they must raise additional funds to pay for the expansion and improvement of their health and educational facilities and the dues were raised to These increases were noted by the various Political Agents in residence at the time and assurances were given in 1931 and 1936 by His Highness that they would not be applied to British subjects. I find however that some British subjects have in fact been paying the full amount of duty, up to 4% as a legal impost and the extra per cent- age as a voluntary contribution, presumably to obviate any cause of friction between themselves and their brother merchants. 6. In my opinion the Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement of 1907 is defunct and it has no value except as an example of how not to make use of the English language. I believe that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in assuming that Clause 10 is still operative is not only legally unsound but it is politically inexpedient for it is not in accord with our declared policy that we should insist on preferential treatment for our own subjects in an Independent State to the detriment of the interests of the natives of that State. Not only will it cause bitter feeling between the two communities in Kuwait but it will be exploited to the full by our enemies who will delight in warning the Arab world against the British who in Kuwait insist that their subjects should only pay 4% Customs dues while Kuwait merchants have to pay in order that sufficient funds are raised to carry on the Government.5. G-ovemment • 7 # I have discussed this subject at some length both with His Highness and with his Secretary and found them both in considerable doubt regarding how far they were in fact bound by any of the clauses of the 1907 Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement. They both stressed how difficult it was in these more enlightened days to grant preferential treatment to foreigners to the detriment of Kuwait subjects and the Secretary asked for my advice in regard to the on legality of our insisting/His Highness obtaining His Majesty’s Government’s permission to the taxation of British subjects equally with his own. I referred him to Clause 10 of the Bandar Shuwaikh Agreement 1907. Whatever my own personal views, and I have explained them T trust clearly in this despatch, I have carried out my instructions and His Highness has written a letter, a copy of which forms an enclosure to this despatch, asking for His Majesty’s Government’s concurrence in the payment of the full Customs dues by British subjects and I request and advise that such concurrence be obtained with all due despatch and that the question of the legality and advisibility of our insistence on the observance of a clause in an Agreement defunct these twenty years be examined. I further recommend that as soon as practicable after the present hostilities have been terminated we enter into a comprehensive agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait which will supercede the vague documents which now are supposed to define the ties which bind the two countries together, and will clearly and concisely define our relations and individual obligations to each other.

Sir, I have the honour to state that it was reported in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary for the second half of November 1941 that from the «i3r&amp; November the Kuwait Customs import duty liad been increased from 5t# to 6-£, valorem in order to provide additional funds for the Education and Medical .Departments. Itjwas stated tha increase did not affect British subjects. In a subs ecu out Nummary however viz. that for the first half of February it was stated that the increase applied equally to British and Kuwait subjects. 2. As soon as this came to my notice I pointed out to the Political Agent that the application of this increase of duty to British subjects was against the terms 10 of the Bandar Shuwailch Agreement of 1907» Which c* was still regarded as being in force in spite of the termination of the lease, and asked him to ensure that increase was not applied to British subjects. The upsl of conversations between the Political Agent and the Shaikh on the subject is that the latter has written letter asking that in the circumstances of the case Majesty’s Government should agree to the incre applied to British subjects. I end os e a trr the letter in question. 3. The Kuwait import duty was first to 4t/ff in 1931, on which occasion as tt6 /-Ji V &amp; acting under the esi denw tae Shaikh promiaed ^nse be levied from British ant of India mde enquiries je in their letter Do.P*556-11/34 f ^4 and were informed that it did ed hy British suhjeots. The import in 1336 vide paragraph IV(a) iot applied po British suhjeots. In 1940 the r was raised to vide paragraph lV(c) of the jini strati on Report for that ye art hut it is not ether the increase was applied to British suojeats I enquired from the political Agent v/hether British .s have in fact Been paying import duty in excess of ot and he has informed me that some of them 'have ying the full amount of duty» up to 4# as a legal ind *whe extra percentage as a voluntary contribution, )ly to obviate any cause of friction between them- aud their brother merchants *. British subjects doing ass in Kuwait are very few . a number and I rather anpeut that they nave been paydm the extra duty for some onsidorable time either because they were not aware of the reuption to which they were entitled, or because the extra amount of duty was comparatively small and they did not wish to get themselves into disfavour with the loc^J. authoiutieu *by making a fuss over it, 5 . The Political Agent reports that the Shaikh is in considerable doubt regarding the extent to which be is still any of the clauses of the 1907 agreement. He y in 1931 acted as if he ware still bound by clause I think in the present oas% If we were to insist he * 0 t continue to observe the provisions of that it^Maa iiepoft for that year, but this increase 1 9 and by implication clause 10 of the- a - / ing still operative of. paragraph 6 of letter from the oreign Office to the India Office tfo.23.3382/119/91 dated the 3rd September 1927 but their continued validity is at least questionable and It would seem very desirable to incorporate in some new agreement so much of their pro visions as it may be deemed necessary to retain* The present time however is clearly not suitable fbr initiating negotiations for such an agreement and it is necessary only to consider what reply should be sent to the Shaikh’s letter* 6. There appear to be two courses open; we can reply either (a) that we regret that in view of the undertaking given in 1907 we cannot agree to British subjects being charged import duty in excess of 4;£ f or (b) that in the special circumstances of the case we agree to British subjects paying the duty on condition that the Shaikh agrees that in accordance with previous practice no further increase in duty should be applied to British subjects r without the consent of His Tlajesty^ Government. In the latter case we should ask for a formal acceptance by the Shaikh of the condition imposed. 7. The position at Bahrain is that in accordance with Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861 British subjects cannot be called upon to pay duty of more than 5$ ad valorem on goods imported by them. In 1932 however with the consent of His v Majesty f s Government the Bahrain Government increased the duty on certain luxuries to 10/S ad valorem and on alcohol to 15,£ and these increases were made applicable to British subjects. There is here in any case no differentiation between British subjects and others as all alike pay 5% import duty on articles other than those mentioned above. In Muscat under the Treaty of 1939 British subj entitled to most favoured nati or z' fact pay the eaice import auti^§ ir- 4 - 8. The increase of import duty whioh the 'ihaiich of Kuwait now asks to he applied to British subjects is a small one «— viz, from 4,£ to 6i# f and part of this is specifically for beneficent objects. I am inclined to think that it would be invidious to refuse agreement and that such refusal would tend to make British traders unpopular with the Kuwait authorities and merchants and would also provide^propaganda for the enemy. I accordingly recommend that the Shaikh^ request to be permitted to recover duty on goods imported by British subjects should be concurred in on the condition stated in para graph 6. 9, I should be grateful for telegraphic instructions, * 10.
