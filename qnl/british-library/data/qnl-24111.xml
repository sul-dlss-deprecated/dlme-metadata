The material is In all 4 packages (1 cardboard and 3 drums of varying size) now lying with me in the office, having missed the R.A.P. plane that took off for Sharjah last Wednesday. I have had a very unpleasant experience with the R.A.F. authorities in Bahrain last week when I carried many similar unvieldy packages, that were received from Messrs.Jashanmal, most of them addressed to D.L.S. and probably for namesake one for P.O.T.C., for delivery to them for onward transmission to Sharjah. These packages had to be taken as they were received because it was not possible for all of ^jhern be included in the diplomatic bags mainly due to their vrfmT sizes. Though the R .A .F. authorities were a little bit relectant at the outset, finally they agreed to received the packages for onward transmission, after I, in the way of request, persuaded them to do so. However they have made it clear that they would not accept similar packages in future unless they were sent to them a couple of days earlier. This, I think is quite reasonable, but at the same time I cannot but think what an amount of difficulties this would involve. As it is the Agency motor transport is being used twice in a week, altogether 2 trips to the R.A.F. Station, Muharraq, for sending and collecting mall to and from Sharjah. If we are not under any obligations either to the D.L.S. or the local merchants, I suggest, if P.A. X&amp;iOC sees no objection, that we better stop receiving similar packages in future and that the packages already forwarded to us by Messrs.Yousuf Almoyyed for onward transmission to Sharjah may now be returned to them, mxA instructing tkJBe that they are not to forward packages as such in future for onward transmission to any destination that we are closing Diplomatic Mail Bags, unless otherwise they are addressed to any of the Agencies or their officers in charge. The merchants can very well afford to make their own arrangements, owing to the fact that British India Steamers are now calling at ports like Sharjah every fortnight once and in addition Country Crafts are also sailing almost daily from Bahrain to the various Gulf ports. f P.A.

Dear Stobart, We have recently been experiencing trouble with the R .A .F. over the number of heavy parcels and packages, many of them personal, which they are asked to send dov;n by air bag for members,of the Desert Locust Survey. Requests to Include these packages in the air bag do not come to us, but the first notification we receive is usually from the merchant who says that he has had a request to send such and such package urgently down to Sharjah by air. I feel that it would be impolitic for us to strain the goodwill of the R .A .F. too much over this point, particularly as communications between her6 and Sharjah are quite tenuous enough. I will be grateful therefore if you will discuss this matter at your discretion with Lee Cldfield and let him know that for the moment at least we are having to divert heavier packages to sea-mail, as the B.I. Steamers make not infrequent calls now-a-days. You might perhaps call his attention to the recent strict circular from the Foreign Office on the subject of parcels and packages being despatched by air bag and also suggest that in future he might contact us direct if there is anything heavy that is particularly urgent and must be flown down by plane. A Yours sincerely, 05^- v- m P.D. Stobart, Esq., M.B.E., Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah,iCs British Agency,Sharjah. 6th July, \ 19^0. i . f Your 2084 Dt.26th^^une, 4- 2. i i I quite agree witlkyour point. I have seen at • V \ '' ^ , ^1 various times he'eiy parcels of groceries in the bag. The answer is, I think, to instruct the merchant to send the goods air-freight at his customer's expense, either by RAF or by Bosworth. I have spoken to Lee Oldfield on the lines you suggested, 3. I hepe it will still be possible for McCaully to receive his medicines by bag, as nearly every package contains Penicillin or vaccines which require urgent delivery to avoid deterioration through heat. 12 '?
