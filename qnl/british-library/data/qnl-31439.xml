I have now discussed the situation with K.H. Sultan thinks that it would be inadvisable to reduce the garrison at present moment and suggests that it would be more prudent to wait and see what comes of the meeting at Bidbid. To reduce the strength of the troops just now might,he thinks, cause the rebels to look upon such an action as prompted by fear and might encourage them to take offensive. Should they attack, the present number of troops would probably be able to administer severe punishment on them while reduced garrison could not do so.

There was n© attack by the Kuna enemy last night ®r throughout today (12th.January). They are however still in the vicinity. I have discusaed the situation with the O.C. Troops at Bait al Falaj. Enemies casualties are estimated at 500. It is reported that Isa bin Saleh has been woundedand Imam to be retiring much disheartened. Some lett ers which the Sultan received tonight confirm this report and state that enemy’s casualties were ' countless ', mainly among people of Fanjn and the Hajriyin. The fighting was most desperate and the conduct of compara- ••mall number of troops agAinst enemy’s strength which is estimated at 3000 was most admirable. The enemmy’s attack was carried to pbint of bayonet. They proved to be both brave and enterprising. Their recklessness and the vigour of the ir att ack was undoubtedly due to a Jihad having been preached among them. ^his^evidenced by a statement which a wounded prisoner made to me and also by the fact that they carried only white standards as their emblem. Another significant fact is that in a communication received by Sultan there is indication that German influence had been at work. There was also a general report locally that the Imam had preached that as the Germans were fighting for Turkey on the side of Islam,it behoved his followers to fight against the enemy of Turkey,. They were al so inced that ewing te our preoccupation elnewhere,neither naval or military assistance c.uld he sent here.

The present experience has taught us at least two things (l) that the enemy are brave and enterprising, and Mwardes tells me excell ent shots and adepts at taking cover (2) that the present garrison is insufficient to hold more than Bait al &gt;’alaj and even that Id ward- es considers very difficult.

My denr Benn, Very mnny th^n^s for your interesting account In your D/0 of the 12th: January of the affair at Masqat and Msttrsh . A? you have sent a cony to Si r P erC y ^ i no doubt he will deal with it , so this Is a mere acfcnoriedgement . You dont say which hill it w«s that wsp surrounded and ag«in retaken hut I should have liked to know, w as It the one on the extreme right flank watching the sea route into Muttra but X suppose it c~u 1 d hardly h^ve been that otherwise one would have thought that the rebels would have actually penetrated Mattra? The ^nly possible point I b^ve to criticize is wh^re on on- of your telegrams you s^id th r t you were diacouraglng the Multan from sending his troops in pursuit. 1 s^id nothing »bout it to Foreign as , wh.en all is said and done » it is « matter of Judgment and the man on the spot probably knows best. But it struck me t hat the Bolt n ought to be bble to guage the strength of fueling in the interior better t.h-'-n any SngliPhrnan and it w^s perhaps dangerous to interfere with his discretion. X do not suppose that anything would came of the despatch of his troops but the country ~i'•■'ht h ve been ready to ris^- on a defeated army and Bis Highness * men might have h^i a triumphal progress . After ail R*R« must ^till have some sympathisers toe rebels sr^ not only divided into half reconciled factions but 01^0 their le^le^s must h^ve made many enemies during their regime. A^d even if, as you anticipated , some Buitan’s troops or Banl u ma r h§a. been cut up , I am callous or cynical enough to a ell eve that no great harm woul ’ have been done . The rebels, even flushed with victory over some catch ’em alive pee , wovld have t e sense to know that the real nut to crack was the Beyt ai Foi p&gt;.i garrison and that tribal fights affected(2) I put these vie^s tn n short telegrem to Cox hut he h s not replies, forwarded them os for ^s I v n ow # He mey disagree with them or, even If he agrees , s»my thlnh that the opportunity , If there ever as one , n*s now gone and th e t it 1^ not worth 'while raising a very disputed point. I felt much thr-t w»y mysel^ when telegraphing to him. Still the opportunity might recur and, 1^ it does you might thlnK that the situation was worth thinking over again. A mounded Isa bln s „leh might find hi.rself in retreat very exhausted ^n' in a d°nger6usi position when Mnoqat cut throats would b ft quite equal to polishing h'm o^f and bring ing his head in to His H 4 ghnes^ on a charger and an episode liKe that would give H^wysr furieusement a penser.

I do n^t think H..H. serious- ly meant t© send his force against.^ I believe he intended all along to send the emissary,referred to in one of my later teleg -rams,into the interior to first guage the feelings of the defeated rebels. It now seems,as you will see from my report, that negotiations are on foot and the Imam,much chastened,seems anxious to bury the hatchet and come to terms. Let us hope that these negotiations will materialise. If H.H. can only obtain possession of the Bidbid and Samal Forts without further fighting it will be agreat achievement.

Please refer to your telegram No 192 B, dated 5th.February. I was on the point of sending you the following telegram in con tinuation of my telegram No.37 of 27th.January ( which please se^, jj when your telegram arrived. Telegram begins ' The emissary sent has by the Sultan to Sib/returned from there having accomplished little or nothing. It now transpires that invitations to meet emissary were not addressed to the Imam,as stated in para. 10 of my report No.31 of 25th.January, nor to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh or Shhikh Hamyar but to a few tribal chiefs only. Of the latter ' ( \ only the Beni Jabir and 4 ©there responded to the invitation, The remainder did not meet the emissary at Sib having been intim idated by threatening lett**s from the Imam ant Harayar. Those who did meet him gave their assurances that they would help the Sultan in the event of his marching a force against Samail, ^ The Sultan has replied to them that he would very shortly put their loyalty to the test. H.H. has however informed me that the recent heavy expenditure he has had to incur will prevent him from undertaking any further operations just now. For the next two months or so he proposes ©nljr t© watch events. :’e has allowec the emissary and his Beni Umar followers t© depart to their homes, and negotiations are therefore at an end for the present. The Irnai* is now living in the Fort of Samail. The position is that although the tribesmen are undoubtedly in a chastened condit -ion and will not willingly cooperate with the Imam,except under intimidation,by him, the three principal rebel leaders are xI xh: defiant* As they are masters ©f the situation { in that they h©l&lt; possession of the Samail valley) it is not unlikely that they will r.fuse t. negotiate; n.r is H.H. in a position t. use compul- :|| -sion.

An advance by us in Samail in suppert ef the Sultan is what the rebels really fear. * Telegrain ends. It will be observed from the above reisarks that while the Imaa holds the trump card in Samail the chances of bringing him to negotiati# are not so favourable as they were. Your sugg estion for the Political Agent to act as intermediary would I am sure be gratefully welcomed by H.H, It certainly appears the only chance of effecting an understanding between the Sultan and the rebel#. But here again the strong position of the Imam to gether with the bigoted religous views which both he and his ad herents hold is,I fear,not unlikely to militate against your pro posal materializing . With all deference I submit that propos al would stand better chance if it were understood that we would not hesitate to assist H.H. to reoccupy Saaail in the event of rebel# refusing to accept our offer of intervention. Samail is the key/ of the situation. Offer of fixed allowances may possibly not prove attractive to | Imam and his two chiefs. Religious reasons may influence the former while the latter already enjoy good incomes from their J jpr present positions. If these allowances had in consequence ft** to be large,the Sultan’s subsidy,which is at present largely ab sorbed in paying off his debts, would possibly be unable to bear sa# a strain. All the grievances of the rebels, except a few,are fi as far as is known at present- capable of adjustment if the Imam and his ad herents, Isa and Hamyar, could be brought to accept negotiations.

Hitherto ©ur policy has been to hold aloof from tribal leaders for fear of exciting Sultan^ suspicion# and the French accusation of undermining his independanee and taking over the country. In consequence I doubt if any Englishman at present knows enough of the politics of the Interior to be able to ap-^^ -predate value of rebel leaders, or to what extent fixed allow- -ances would tempt them to loyalty. Sultan consenting, or is forced to admit principle, policy v^ould have to be gradually introduced by system of joint tour by H,li # c , n g ^he P.A. to important centres, Sultan would follow analogy of the Khan of Kilat and the 'Primus inter pares' princi- ~Ple and it might be considered whether it is not worth while to accept situation frankly and pay allowances ourselves, insisting in return on - (i) Fair treatment for British merchants; (2|) Right to arbitrate between the Sultan and the Sheikhs; &gt; (3) Free passage and friendly reception for P.A. throughout tribal territories.

Reply not yet received ano &gt; in view oj. improbability oi my being able to submit com ments before B.E. the Viceroy leaves Basrah, I venture to anticipate Bernes viev/g by following. suggestion of fixing allowances for tribal headmen is in teresting one and promises in my opinion success but will take time to carry through. Hitherto our policy, if I mistake not, has been to hold aloof from tribal leaders for fear of exciting Sultan's suspicions and French accusations of under mining his independence and taking over country. In conse quence, I doubt if any Englishman at present knows enough of politics of interior to be able to guage value of rebel lead ers or to what extent fixed allowances would tempt them to loyalty. If Sultan consents or is forced to admit principle, policy would have to be gradually Introduced by system of joint tours by H.H. and P.A. to important centres. Sultan would follow analogy of Khan of Kalat and 'primus inter pares' principle and it might be considered whether it is not worth our while i to accept situation frankly and pay the allowances ourselves, insisting in return on/fair treatment for British traders, (2) right to arbitrate between Sultan dnd Shaikhs, (3) free passage and friendly reception for P.A, throughout tribal territories (4) general subordination toyf our interests and advice in all external politics and in regard to Masqat and its ruler. Expense involved in these tours and allowances would be heavy. They would involve giving P.A. political assistant to take current work from his shoulders, while he is engaged ( 1 ) inin these important tours and, until Masqat Levy Corps is established, a double company Indian Infantry with two maxims would have to be placed at P.A's disposal for escort duty during cold weather* further &gt; these Arabs are traders and have resources other than their barren hills and rare oases; they are therefore far more expensive to buy over than their Baluch confreres but the gradual results of such a system would be to create for us friends and intelligence centres in Oman* who would be invaluable in the crisis we are now surmounting and pre vent or paralyse similar outbreaks which w© must otherwise expect, from time to time in the future. Knox.Telegram, P, From Knox, Bushire. To Cox Basrah. No. 35-C. Dated 9.2.15. it is clear from Masqat telegram No. 46 of February 7m that this year we can only hope to fix general trend of po licy but tour, say next November to Samail, should not be difficult. With Masqat strongly held, Sultan and Fblitical Agent moving independently could meet at Bidbid. Fteaceful character of tour could be made clear, and subsequent with drawal and good behaviour. of troops should do much to dispel false ideas. Advance to Samail is inevitable and this would appear least objectionable method. As Benn suggests it could be made clear that if Sam&amp;ii wanted more troops they could have them by attacking peaceful advance party, and in that case I feel fairly confident of success of scheme. , I would negotiate with rebels singly and by special invi- tation, latter to be casual and express desire for friendship and establishment of better relations. Present comparatively peaceful state of Persian Gulf I attribute to success of our blockade, which shows that enor mous sums spent on it have not been thrown away. We might now spend something in pacifying Oman by means of subsidies. Time is in our favour and rebels will be worse armed and hungrier by next November. But policy of subsidies will be useless without establishment of friendly relations with Shaikhs. Sultan must recognise this and not be suspicious of our efforts. I trust that French, who used to be chief obstacle, have been disarmed.

In continuation of correspondence ending with my confidential letter No. 122 , dated 17th May 1915, to your address, I have the honour to submit 2 . When my last report on this subject was submitted, the position was briefly as follows :— A circular letter had, with your approval, been addressed* to the Imam, * vide ^enclosure to this office letter No. ico. Shaikhs Uamyar and Isa bin Saleh, the friendly relations between themselves and His Highness the Sultan restored and offering our intervention in the cause of peace. To this communication replies had been received from the Imam and t Vide this office letter No. 114 , dated the 29 th Shaikh Hamyui only. That of Shaikh The Imam in acknowledging my letter represented the necessity of referring the proposals it contained to the religious leader^ of the people whose views he promised to obtain and forward in due course. Shaikh Hamyar suggested the advisability of our sending a representative into the interior to discuss matters. Neither writer expressed any satisfaction at or even approval of our friendly offer. 3. Since then a reply, purporting to he from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, has been received. W’e have also received various reports from the interior show ing the nature of the reception accorded to my circular letter and indicating the general feeling of the people with regard to it; white we have at the same time been able to obtain indirectly an insight into the main grievances of the rebels and the probable nature of the demands that they will make. ^ In this connection 1 attach copies of four (as being the most interesting and informants from the interior. They tend to throw considerable light also on the general condition of affairs in Oman. 4 . A translation of the reply received from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh is attached. (Enclosure “ A ” ). The letter was delivered to me by a messenger of the Imam to whom it seems to have been sent under “flying seal by Shaikh Isa. It is neither signed nor seated ; nor is it in the handwnimg or Shaikh Isa bin Saleh. But from the statement§ of the informant, Hamad bin Sayad, there The letter is friendly in tor' nn d ^ rl icates a desire to open negotiations* Enclosure. the following report on affairs connected with the “ Imam’s rising ”. dated the 12th April 1915. rebel leaders, expressing our desire to see Isa bin Saleh was then still awaited.f X Enclosures B, C, D, E. representative^) of the numerous tetters received from and statements made by § Enclosure E. seems little reason to doubt that its author is any other than Shaikh Isa bin Saleh.2 No reply has yet been sent to it, partly because of the anonymous nnfure of the communication, but mainly because it would seem more appropriate to await the further communication promised by the chief leader of the rebels, the Imam himself, which should embody both his own views and those of all his following. His Highness the Sultan has also received a friendly letter from Shaikh Isa bin Saleh in which he informs him of the despatch of a messenger, one Abdulla bin Haned, to interview His Highness. 5. With regard to the reception accorded to my circular letter by the inhabitants of the interior, reports received are contradictory. In some quarters cur motive was deliberately misrepresented and our offer of intervention in the cause of peace was construed to indicate “weakness” and a desire on our part to find an excuse to set free the British troops quartered at Maskat which, it was represented, were urgently required for service in Persia where trouble was also said to be brewing. In this connection a reference to the statement of the informant Haji Abdulla Bastaki, a resident of W T adi Maawal, is invited (Enclosure “ C ”). This man’s statement, it will be observed, also indicates the existence of German influence in the interior, and it would not be unreasonable to attribute the unfriendly attitude of the Omani people now evinced towards our friendly offer to this cause. The existence of German agents in the interior is also corroborated by the letter (Enclosure “ B ”) addressed to rae by a Kazi of Sur, Makomad bin Ahmad, and by the statement of Nasar bin Suleiman attached herewith (Enclosure “ H ”). On the other hand, the letter of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh and the information obtained during the visit to me of Hamad bin Sayad (Enclosure “ E ”) indicate a more friendly attitude. They clearly betray—whatever the Imam may have caused to be publicly announced to the contrary—an inclination on the part of the people and of at least one of the rebel leaders to welcome the opportunity of our intervention with a view to an amicable settlement. 6 . The views, grievances, expectations and probable demands of the rebels as elicited in the course of an interview with Hamad bin Sayad are recorded in the memorandum attached at Enclosure i( U”. W r hile too much import ance cannot be attached to this man’s statements—as, by his own showing, be was in no way authorised to speak on behalf of the rebel leaders—yet his views and opinions reflecting, as they probably do, those of the Imam and Shaikh Isa, are important and have therefore been considered deserving of official record. There is little doubt that lie had been sent by the rebels to ascertain to what extent their demands were likely to be accepted. He showed much anxiety to obtain information with regard to these demands and begged to be entrusted with a reply to take back to “ the people of Oman ”. He was informed that no details could be discussed except with a duly authorised representative sent by the Imam and that as he was not in possession of any credentials, any such discussion with him was out of the question. He was, however, informed in a general way what demands it would pro-, bably be unwise for the rebels to include in any statement that they might feel disposed to submit in due course. These will also be found embodied in the memorandum at Enclosure “ E ”. He was also assured that any representa-s tiops made in the proper way would receive our sympathetic consideration. The man left Maskat for Awabi, where the Imam is now residing, on the 4th June. He promised to return “ with furtlier information ” in due course, and hirded that a statement of such of the rebel demands as lay in our power to grant w r ould be submitted to me direct and that others, affecting tiie Sultan only, wnmld be sent to His Highness; but that a copy of the latter w T ould also be sent to me anonymously fpr informatiou. His Highness w r as informed by me at once of the purport of my interview with this man. His Highness entirely approved of the action taken and of the reply given to Hamad bin Sayad. The Sultan’s view is that while a few ot the more intelligent people may possibly desire a reconciliation, the religious element, headed by the Imam, who are still engaged in preaching a jehad, are opposed to peace and will exercise their superior influence to render all efforts at an amicable settlement abortive. In any case His Highness isTOTi''mctd that the rebels will never surrender the Samail vallev, for which His otaimr m 8 ° U 88 3 S COndltlon of Peace, except under force 7. Of the movements of the rebels in the interior there is little to record For several months they have shown no activity there, nor are there any st ns ot any desire on their part to renew combined hostilities. Small bamls of raiders have given trouble in the vicinity of the military picquets and have on ,wo occasions succeeded in carrying off herds of goats belonginsr to the garrison J bey have also looted cattle from the coast village of Rautha, while qu'te recently a somewhat serious encounter took place between the Sultan's troops and Beni Battash at Kuaryat. On the 4th June the militarv nice,nets engaged a smal party ot about 40 raiders near the Kurram villLeand reported that they had killed or wounded two of the enemy. There were no casualties among the troops. H. M. S. “Dalhousie,” '(hen not required for duty on the Mekran Coast, ms been stationed in xVlaskat waters and her presence here has undoubtedly had a deterrent effect on the inhabitants of the iuterior. J The progress of the war is watched with much interest locally The general feeling in the interior would appear to be entirely pro-German. In &gt;1 ask at it is the same but to a very much less extent. Distorted accounts of the war and anti-British propaganda have undoubtedly been circulated in the interior, hut His Highness has loyally co-operated with this Agency in indenti- f\ ing offendeis. Several arrests of suspected persons have been made and severe punishment has been meted out by His Highness in each case. These vigorous measures are having a very salutary effect, 8 . A copy of this report is being sent, for information, to the Hon’ble the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Enclosure “A.” Translation of an Arabic letter from Isa bin Saleh to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 23rd Jamadi 11 1333=11th May 1915. After compliments .—Peace be to him who follows the righteous. I have received your letter and understood its contents, namely, that you express regret that differences should exist between the Ruler and the people of the interior and that the British Government love peace and harmony. This (of course) is desired by every man of sense. But you have not explained the means whereby jou propose to bring about a reconciliation. So please do this that we may consider the matter and, God willing, we will give you our answer thereto. I only received your letter a few days ago and some words of it I did not understand.

The following are Ihe names of these persons and I have obtained them from the records of the Customs Superintendent at Sur, Probably some of these are German spies; we may perhaps presume so; for it seems that some of them, if not all, had in Dieir possession papers or certificates of German protection. These papers ^ ere shown to Jairam, the Customs Superintendent at Sur, and were taken hack (by the owners)*4 Mk, /.; : I It is a pity that they were not then withheld as there was no war then and all were at peace, but there being then no occasion for any suspicion, thev were allowed to go. Another rumour that I have heard since my arrival here is that two persons from the interior arrived secretly here, at Sur, and embarked for some place up the Gulf, intending to join the Turks and then bring back with them German officers in order to take them into the interior of Oman. God only knows the truth of all this. I submit the news as it was received by me and you may take it for what it is worth. lam always ready to carry out your orders whenever you may be pleased to send any.

They were landed at Tawi whence they proceeded to Oman on 22nd Jamadi II, 1332, just a little over a year now. Another man— No. 8 . Khamis bin Mahomed el Khamisi is a clever scoundrel and a German subject and arrived in the dhow belonging to Khamis bin Rashid, named “ Wadal Ayar ”, on the 28th Jamadi II, 1332, just a year and a few days ago. Enclosui'e “ C Summary of information given by Haji Abdulla, Bastaki, of Wadi Ma’awal, to the Political Agent, Maskat, on 25th May 1915. I am a resident of Wadi Maawal where I do business. I have just come from there.^ The fact of the British Consul having written letters to the Imam, Shaikh Isa and Shaikh Hamyar suggesting overtures for peace is generally known throughout the interior. The contents of the letter were publicly made known. The Consul’s letter is generally regarded as evidence of weakness on the part of the British Government. It is generally stated that the British have already had to reduce the number of their troops in Maskat owing to the war and that as they now wish to remove rest of the troops also and cannot find more reinforcements, they are desirous of coming to terms. Hie religious leaders are preaching a jehad. They say that the “Imams’’ of Maskat are non powerful and that the present opportunity is a favourable one tor attacking Ma$kat and driving out the Syud (Saltan) and the infidels. Iliey recommended immediate action, but other people advised postponing the attack uijitil after the date harvest and Ramazan, and this was decided upon. Their present attitude points to a determinatiou to renew hostilities in the autumn. German agents have been at work in the interior. A sum of $4,000 was offered to the Imam, through Isa bin Saleh, last year by one Habib bin Sulayim of Muthahadamat, a German agent, who is known to have spent many years in the Congo,. A message was sent with the money to the Imam to the following effect:—“ The money now sent you is only an advance. More will be sent you as much as is required to enable you to stir up trouble in Maskat against the English. We will help you, but you should first send us a signed paper assuring us that you will do as we wish. You shall have justice and peace when we are established in Maskat.” ^ijtiNo written reply or signed paper was given but a verbal message was t in replv through Babib bin Sulayim to the effect that “ nothing can be o^enin writing but if Maskat comes into our hands it will be well The nOOO was not accepted by the Imam. The above is what I have learnt regarding the feelings of the Oman Arabs. Eecorded by me, R. A. E. Benn, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. Enclosure “ D ”. Statement of Nash bin Sulaiman, Siyabi, Wadi Samail, aged 60 years.. I live in Wadi Samail and have come from there to give information to His Highness the Sultan of the state of affairs in my part of the country. It is generally known throughout the interior that the British Govern ment wrote a letter to the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar asking the people of Oman to make peace with the Sultan. All these letters were sent to Shaikh Isa for perusal as he is thought to be better able to understand these things. The Imam and Hamyar said they would accept whatever Shaikh Isa advised. The Imam, however, will never surrender and the people will never openly admit that they want peace. But they aH s_ee the hopelessness of their cause and of their trying to fight against the British troops and in their hearts they really welcome the offer of negotiations, Eor this reason they have left the decision to Shaikh Isa as he is not an Imam and never can be. Sliai k Bamam it is said, has been selected to succeed the A1 Kharusi as Imam should fhe late be killed. Since the late Imam died the tribes have become disunited and there is therefore hope of negotiations being genera y accep ec. The Imam is not preaching a general jehad, but he will fight to the end to overthrow the present state of affairs in Maskat where there is no Muhammadan law or justice of any kind, only favouritism. J^^t offen s religions leaders more than anything else is the drinking of spirits and smokm wMchls nermitted in Maskat. As regards the war, it is generally believed that the Germans have been victorious and that the German 6 ° 0m ^rg Muhammadan and has assumed the name of Hap “““^nd to have also been told that all the Allies are begging Germany to put an e the war, but the German Emperor has refused to do so. Germany stronger than all the allied Powers owing to eisupeno reaches the tions for killing her enemies.

Enclosure “ B”* . ■ a -a Vw Hamaid bin Saiyid el Faleti, resident of Wasit, Wadi lorandum regarding a visit paid by Ha ,, ^ 9^5 Maawal, to tbe Political Agent, Maskat, on £9th May m*. , ’ ^ , v. el Eaieti asked for and 1. On the 29th May 1915 one Hamaii bi c( . o£ his Tisit W as granted an interview with the Bo i ica S Government ; hut, as his msibly to express his friendship to ® r, r obablv to obtain, on behalf of sequent conversation proved it was m P ^ g our recent offer ot rebel leaders, some further ^formation regard S of the rebels o£ srvention and to ascertain to what extent certain6 the details of which he appeared to be in possession were likely to he granted. While denying that he was in any way authorized to speak on behalf of the Imam or his party, he emphasised the fact that he had great influence with them through friends, and was prepared to convey to them any proposals that might be entrusted to him. 2 . He appeared to be a man of some standing in the interior and has trade interests in Socotra. He stated he was known to the Aden authorities and said that on one occasion he had successfully been employed by them as an intermediary in a long standing dispute with regard to Socotra. Incidentally he had a fairly accurate knowledge of the present European situation except with regard to the reasons for Turkey’s participation in the war on the side of Germany, on which point opportunity was taken to correct his knowledge. He also believed that the German Emperor had become a convert to Islam. 3. After some conversation on general topics, he introduced the subject of my recent circular letter to the rebel leaders and stated that it had been publicly read out and discussed in the interior. The people generally, he said welcomed our intervention, hut being unintelligent, they suspected that some ulterior motive lay behind our offer and were wondering “ what the British Government wished to gain out of it”. He was aware, he said, that replies had been received from the Imam and Shaikh Hamyar and enquired whether a third reply had not quite recently been received from Isa bin Saleh through the Imam. On being informed that such a reply had been received hut that it was neither signed nor sealed, nor in the hand writing of Shaikh Isa, he stated that he could vouch for its authenticity and that it had been written by Isa’s brother-in-law. He stated that he was present when it was received by the Imam and forwarded on to me. The contents had been skowm to him by the Imam and in proof thereof he proceeded to quote quite accurately the purport of the letter. He said that Shaikh Isa hoped to receive a reply to his enquiry as to “wliat terms we were prepared to offer”. I. Further conversation elicited the following information from him:— “ The ^ views, grievances, expectations and demands of the rebels are the following:— “ ( 1 ) The Sultan is not really anxious for a reconciliation. He says he wants peace only to please the British Government. There is too much dirty linen to be washed, and this the Sultan wishes to avoid doing in public. Ihe course of the negotiations will disclose matters of which we are not now aware. s&lt;: ( 2 ) The Sultan is generally regarded as a heretic. He does not conform to the Muhammadan Faith and has greatly incensed the people of Oman thereby. ” (3) The rebels would naturally prefer to have peace, but would only agree to it provided the following demands were accepted :— “(a) The full recognition of the ‘Sharah’Law as practised by the Imam in the interior and its establishment in Maskat in substitu tion of the existing unjust system of dealing with civil and criminal cases. No favouritism to people connected with the Palace as now exists. c£ (b) The removal of the British troops and the land blockade on imports in to the interior. “ (c) The full settlement of financial claims due to inhabitants in the interior. “ (^) absolute prohibition of the import of wines, spirits and tobacco into Maskat and Oman. The use of these commodities to be strictly forbidden. “ (e) The present Sultan to be regarded a the! c Euler of Oman ’; but the Imam to administer the country according to the religious Law, as recognised in the interior, either personally or through a representative at Maskat. (/) As the tribes of the interior live in a state of conflict with each other and as some tribes have rifles and others have not, it isessential that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be permitted to the inhabitants of Oman. ” He then asked if a reply could he given to him on these points and what my views were. 5. It was explained to him that the rebel leaders had already been invited to submit their grievances, that the Imam had promised to consult his followers on the subject and to communicate with me further. The Imam’s reply was still aw ait ell and pending its receipt it would he premature to discuss details with him, especially as he appeared to be in no way authorised to speak on behalf of the Imam and his party. 6 . The opportunity, however, was taken to inform him in general terms what demands and conditions it would probably be umcise for the rebel leaders to include in any proposals that they might wish to submit in due course. These were — (1) Any demand that suggested the non-recognition of the Sultan’s legitimate rights in Maskat and the interior of Oman. (2) Any demand that suggested the contravention of Treaty rights between the British Government and Oman, in which connection we recognised no one hut His Highness the Sultan, SyudTaimur. (3) Any demand that would cause injury to or hamper British interests or trade with Oman. ( 4 ) Any demand for the discontinuance of the existing Arms Ware house arrangements or the non-observance of its Bales and Emulations which would continue to be rigorously enforced. It was also explained to him that the British Government were now, as always, anxious for peace, and would use their best endeavours to bring about a reconciliation between His High ness the Sultan and the rebel leaders, and that beyond that they had no other motive whatever. 7. After requesting me to obtain permission from the Sultan for him to return to his country, Hamad bin Sayad took his leave. 8 . The following day the Sultan was informed of the purport of the above interview. His Highness approved of the action taken and of the reply given to Hamad bin Sayad. 9.

Enclosure II indicates that the rebel leaders are finding some difficulty in deciding how to treat our offer of intervention and that, owing to the reports of British reverses in Europe, evidently circulated by German agency m the interior, the commencement of negotiations with the rebels may be attended with some difficulty.

The Sultan has t;one off on a short cr .is® and says he will be back in 2 or 3 days time. There has been trouble in Dasht (north of Gwadur) as the Dizaki Sardars have been raiding badly.

Troop# Gulf to state the minimum strength to which he could reduce the garrison here B on the assumption that a man-of-war will be retained in Mascat waters*. I understand: that a reply was sent and a reduction of the garriso agreed to on the above assumption. $he Dalhousie since then has been stationed here,making periodic al visits to J&amp;sk and Chabar. Shw was however suddenly ordered to Gwadur the other day without any intimation being given to us and now she has without any warning whatever left for Bushire. My object now in writing is to suggest that,if not inconvenient, some intimation might be given to us here of any intention to mov the ship away from these waters -especially if her absence is lik - ly to be long duration. Formerly we used always to be consulted and asked if the ship cod d he spared; hut that practice seems now to have been discontinued. As a master of fact the Sultan was rather relying on the presence of the Dalhousie here Just now as he is undertaking operations i| against the Beni Battash who have been giving a lot of trouble / lately. Personally I do not think that these operations will come to much. Just at present too the rebels in the interior do ^ot seem in dined to give trouble; but if they did the reduced garrison migl t \fnfrrri1fft^f to meet the situation. The O.C.

E. Benn, C.I.E., Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. L - , i In continuation of my confidential letter No. 120f'dated the 14th June 1915, I have the honour to submit the following report on Maskat affairs more especially in connection with the correspondence recently initiated with the Imam and other rebel leaders on the subject of negotiations for a settlement of their differences with the Sultan of Maskat. 2. In paragraph 6 of my above quoted letter it was reported that I had received a visit from one Shaikh Hamaid bin Sa’id al Palaiti of Awabi in the interior, who, while denying that he was inrany way authorised to speak on behalf of the Imam and his party, appeared to have been expressly sent by them to make known their views regarding terms of peace and to ascertain how far these were likely to be accepted by us. These views were summarized and will be found in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum (Enclosure E) attached to my last report. Shaikh Hamaid appeared extremely anxious for me to commit my reply to paper forthwith and to entrust him with it as our emissary to the Imam, hut, lacking as he did, any credentials from the Imam I deemed it inadvisable to comply with his request and confined myself to explaining to him that as correspondence had already been initiated between myself and the Imani on this subject and as the latter had promised to favour me^ with his own views and those of the other leaders personally, it would be both premature and in appropriate to discuss details with him meanwhile. Shaikh Hamaid left Maskat on the 4th June and promised to return. He has not yet done so. 3. On the 26th June, however, I received a letter from him and also one purporting to he from “ the Qazi of the Imam ’ . The latter letter is both unsigned and sealed, and though the views expressed therein may possibly represent those of the Imam, there is nothing whatever to show that this is so, and I venture to think that, in the absence of any endorsement thereon by the Imam, we should not be justified in acting on them. Shaikh Hamaid does not appear to have been very successful in his interview with the Imam ; for his letter admits that when he attempted to discuss matters with him the Imam « turned his face away ” from him. In these circumstances, I have refrained from doin 01 more than sending to the Shaikh an acknowledgment of his letter and that of the Qazi pointing out my inability to treat with him and repeating what I had already told him verbally in Maskat that I stiff awaited the pro mised reply from the Imam himself. In reply to this I received a somewhat118 % indignant communication from the Shaikh, A suitable reply has keen sent to him and it is not proposed to continue further correspondence with him. I have also addressed a brief note to the Imam reminding him of his pro mise to submit his views and informing him that certain letters purporting to represent his views had been received by me from Shaikh Hamaid bin Said and others, hut that in the absence of any endorsement on them by himself it ■was impossible for me to accept or place any confidence in them. 4. I now attach copies of three of the abovemen tinned letters.* Enclo- . Enclosures I, II, III. 3,1,1 111 eml, ° d y th «“ ''ms ’ ’ upon winch, according to Shaikh Hamaid and the Qazi of the Imam, the Imam and the rebel leaders are said to be prepared to proceed with further negotiations. Until we have it from the Imam himself that he endorses the views expressed it wdll serve no useful purpose to discuss those terms here. We should, I venture to think, continue to await the reply promised by the Imam himself. Meanwhile the letters now received are interesting as showing the very bigotted and anti-Christian spirit with which the followers of the Imam appear to be imbued, and as indicating what we may expect to receive from the Imam himself if and when he fulfils his promise to submit his views. 5. Since my last report was submitted a month ago, activity on the part of the rebels has been confined solely to the Bani Battash tribe who have given a good deal of trouble in the Wadi Hatat district where they were reported to have done considerable damage to date gardens owned by adherents of His Highness the Sultan. Khan Sahib Nasib bin Mahomed, the Naval Contractor, who owns valuable property at Hajjar in the Hatat, received a letter from the Bani Battash threatening him with the destruction of his gardens there unless he forwarded a considerable sum of money as the price of exemption, The amount, eventually reduced by frds, was paid by the Contractor. On the §7th June, a gang of Bani Battash visited the neighbourhood of Sidab and sniped at the detachment. The tribes more immediately connected with the Imam gave no trouble during the month. 6. His Highness the Sultan is now on the point of undertaking punitive operations, on what would appear to be on extensive scale against the Bani Battash. His Highness’s intention is to send four columns into the interior from different points on the coast as under — (1) Irom Mathra .—The Bani Buhaha tribe under the Wali of Mathra. (2) From Iti.—The Siyabiyin and Bani Jabir under Shaikh Bashid. (3) From Qaryat.—The Bani Aamir and Bani Ali under one of His TIighness’s brothers. (4) From jD a ghmar.— The Bani Bu Ali under the Wali of Sur. All the coin inns are to concentrate by different routes on Hail Ghaf, the stronghold of the Band Battash, rounding up any of their marauding gangs on the way. His Highness has himself left Maskat in his steayn yacht to supervise the above arrangements personally. Beioie his departure His Highness explained to me that he was not unmindiul of the fact that peace proposals had been initiated with the Imam and that while these were still pending punitive operations such as he contemplated might be considered out of place; His Highness said that he quite recognised that it would be inappropriate for him to take the offensive in the case of those rebel tribes of the interior who always looked directly to the Imam for their orders; but that as the Bani Battash, against whom alone these operations would be directed, were practically independent of the Imam and were pnere hands of marauders whose deprei dations were not instigated by the Imam, ofiensive operations against them were justifiable and could not, he thought, in any way be regarded as a breach of faith on his part. 7.

Translation of a Utter from Hamaid bin Sa'id al Falaiti to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, dated the 5tli Shaban 1333 (19th June 1915). After compliments .—I went to the men whom I expected to help me. I let them know what was my object and they agreed with me. I then went to the Imam and briefly explained matters to him ; hut the Imam turned his face from me, as the subject seemed (to him) against the principles of our Muhammadan law. A certain man, who is one of the strong supporters of the Imam and who was one of those who had appointed the Kharusi as Imam, told me that there was hope of a settlement being arrived at, as the conditions (as explained by me to the Imam' did not seem to be very much in opposition to “ Shara ” and the laws of Islam and that the Imam would consult the Mullas and the tribal heads. If you wish for peace slave dealing should be allowed or in short if a slave escapes from his master (and takes refuge with you) he should be returned to his master. Arms, ammunition, gun-powder, lead, saltpeter, caps and such like may he allowed to be sold in Maskat and at their former prices. The excess duty now levied (by the Sultan) should be stopped. That is to say all trade allowed by “ Shara” should be permitted. Whatever “ Shara ” allows and disallows must be observed. Oman affairs should always be conducted according to the opinion of the “ Ulema ” of Oman. The Ulema will administer justice to all (Muham madans) as long as they are resident in Oman. Other particulars will be explained to you on my arrival at Maskat. Your authority (lit. protection) will not be recognised when “ Shara ” does not accept it, as all Muhammadans are under the religious law and they are bound to abide by the “ Shara ” and not by any other law. If vou will reply assuring me that you agree to the above I will go to the leaders of Oman and collect their views and those of the Imarn; but .some of the conditions will, no doubt, have to be changed to suit Shara .

After compliments .—I beg of our leaders who are wise and who are capable of being of one mind and of one opinion, with the help of one another according to the Muhammadan law and religion, to stop the bloodshed of Muhammadans without delay. You are able to negotiate for peace and God will unite all hearts together. I cannot offer advice to the heads of the people, but you have influence with them and with the Imam. They will listen to you and accept what you propose. I hope that all of you will try to induce Shaikh Isa bin Saleh to propose terms of peace and not harm the people on the Coast of Oman. You know that the Coast of Oman is under the pro tection of the British. Can Oman people fight with the British ? The guns fire shells like rain. Can we hope for success in such circums tances ? Perhaps these words will arouse you and induce you to think about saving yourselves and others. This is my humble advice to my religious brethren and to my people. T. &amp; P. Dept.

I ahve of course submitted separate reports to Government on the general situation^the Sultan^ operations against the BeniB attash and their surrender to him; as also about H.H. *8 visit to Sib where the Beni Jabir and Siyabiyin from Samail, after offering H.H. all sorts of help and volunteering to ad vance against the Imam &amp; the rebels,proved utterly disloyal and deserted to a man. This however was only what H.H. had anticipated. The Sultan is engaged in building a defensive tower at Sib. He has no intention of taking offensive measures against the Imam and is probably rather glad to have the sgxxx excuse that we are now engaged in trying to arrange an amicable settlement for him with the Imam,not to proceed beyond Sib . The peace negotiations however are not proceeding very rapidly and I fancy will not come to anything until xx the Pol .Agent proceeds to Samail with a 'strong escort'. I ahve suiggsted that this should be done. are said to ^eahwhile Sheikh ^^amyar and the Imam/have collected axiacxg a large force at Bidbid and as I informed last night were re ported to be moving to a place near Boshar.

The correspondence is mainly concerned with the rising of the Imam of Oman, Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi against the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Taimur bin Fayṣal bin Turki al-Bu Sa‘idi, and the former’s attack on Muscat in 1915. The Imam’s coalition included Omani tribal leaders, Himyar bin Nasir al-Nabhani, and ‘Isa bin Saleh al-Harthi, who were rising against the existence of the British forces in Muscat and the Sultan’s reliance on the British in his rule. The Imam’s forces met at Sama'il and led their way from there to attack the British forces’ garrison at Bait al-Falaj. Upon the attack, British officials, the Political Agent, Muscat and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in particular reported on the number of casualties from both sides. The attack has raised concerns of more attacks to take place in the future.Among other issues raised in the volume are:current situation in various regions including Sama'il, Nizwa, Sib and othersprevious rising led by the Imam, Azzan bin Qaisthe communication made with the Government of India about the possibility of sending more troops to Muscat in order to assist the existing ones, and the expenses involved in such a stepthe position of the French in Muscat'Isa bin Saleh’s efforts for peacethe suggestion that the Political Agent, Muscat, could act as a mediator between the two sidesthe possible peace negotiationsthe Imam’s conditions for making peace, including: the full recognition of the Sharia Law as practiced by the Imam in the interior, the settlement of the financial claims due to the inhabitants in the interior, and the absolute prohibition of the import of wines, spirits and tobaccosnews of the First World Warthe influence the Imam has on his followers and his anti-British propaganda, seeing the British as enemies of Islamthe spread of pro-German feelings among the tribes of the Sharqiyya regionnews that the Emperor of Germany has converted to IslamThe majority of the correspondence in the volume is dated 1915.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Himyar bin Nasir al-Nabhani</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Hināwī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Ghāfirī (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Nizwa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bait al-Falaj</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sama’il</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bidbid</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seeb</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ibadism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Sharia law</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Āl Bū Sa'īd dynasty, Imam of Muscat and Oman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Shaikh 'Īsá bin Ṣāliḥ al-Ḥārithī</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>First World War (1914-1918)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Rebellions</topic></subject><subject><topic>Internal politics</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000285#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
