During the x'.H's and the P.A. , Kuwaits absence in the U.K., Holmes successfully extracts a useful letter from the Shaikh which seems to point to the fact tnat have prompted the Shaikh to keep out fort igners and that il they (HMGj are pre— pared to waive this clause.

Dated 2^th May 191 Colonel Bisooe will have gone when tliis reaches you, but for record purposes, I write to say that Holmes* sailed for Bahrain yesterday 24th May 1931. in a long rather defiant talk gave me to understand, that he did give the Shaikh the last yea^s draft agreement as well as the new one (sent Biscoe by me) deliberately, as he wanted the Shaikh to decide which of the two he liked best. 3. He said he was aware that last years draft had been turned down by His Majesty's Government for having no nationality clause and the new one was like unto it but that did not worry him, and he was determined to return to Kuwait in about 15 days to see what he could do as regards a special 'National!ty n clause of his own that would suit the Shaikh's 'qualms' (his words). 4. He added that he had been told by the authorities at Home (I've no doubt a lie) that he could again go and try his lucK with the Shaikh even though His Majesty's Government had thrown out his 1930 agreement. By this I suppose he meant that he intended to persuade the Shaikh to waive his objection to a ' British ' clause by hook or by crook. 5. I confess I cannot understand the man's goings on and consider him dangerous. Certainly, (I only get this as hearsay., in fairness to Holmes) he seems to take / pleasure in running down all British Government officials and especially Political Officers of the Indian Government Captain J. R. L. Bradshaw, Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 2 Before he left he came and saw me, and1/, for being 'danmed interfering gentry', whenever he discus 's se(J 'oil' with Arabs, and tries to make out we are all rogues and rascals trying to prevent honest men trying to do business with and bring grist to the pockets of the poor Arabs.Conf identiaiU B.O.No.316-8 of 1931.

I am eoiTy that I hare not had an opportunity of seeing you before you left, and that also I shall not have the benefit of your support at Kuwait during my tenure of Bushire. However, I am sure that Oreenway will prove a good substitute. It is curious that you and I have never met consider ing that we were alongside one another more or less in 'Iraq in neighbouring districta for some time, and have now been together in the Gulf. However, I hope we shall meet when you come back from leave. I have just been going through the Kuwait Oil Concession which is filled with Holmes* activities. Colonel Biscoe before leaving also put me wise to these. The situation, as I understand it, is that the Shaikh insists on the Inclusion of the 'British Control Clause' 1 , which of course we are all out for, and that the Eastern and General Syndicate are not prepared to swallow it; which is all to the good. If at any time be did accept it then the other objections to their proposed agreement pointed out by you and endorsed by Colonel Biscoe could be taken up. The ... Lr.Colonel H.H.P. I)iokson,C.I .E.

The ownership of these islands is generally looked upon as not having been determined. During rqy 4 visit to Kuwait, I had received a report that Major Erank Holmes of the .^astern and General Syndicate had visited some of t.h.ese islands and had talked particularly of Farsi, describing it as his island. Major Holmes has shown clearly during the past six or eight months that he has no desire to meet any of the officers from H.M.Ships. If ships arrive at Bahrain or Kuwait he invariaoly leaves the same day and does not return until they depart. This was particularly noticeable at Kuwait on 17th May. He had been there for some time, possibly trying to open negotiations with the Shaikh, he had been invited by His Excellency to meet me at dinner, but he left for ~asrah at once without any adequate excuse. As he seems to be taking an interest in the islands referred to above I mentioned the matter to the Political Resident, with particular reference to their status, he informs me that the matter will be taken up with the Government of India and the Home Departments.86/ 1 Ko.13 jt 19S1.

We formerly explained to you in our verbal disousBion about the points that H. B. M.

's Govt which is my sincere government, always do their best for the welfare of my country and protect my rights. We, therefore, should not give up what they think interesting to us and our country (best in our interests). t Therefore, should you and your Company come into agreement with H. B.

In the course of conversation, it transpired that ^ajor -olmes had put forward the sug estion that if Ii.E. was agreeable to the abandoning of the nationa lity clause from the agreement ) the British Govern ment would also be agreeable to do so. he Shaikh, however, replied that if the British Government were willing to let this question drop, he woulc abide by their decision^as he had implicit faith and trust in is -la.jesty's Government, but as His --ajesty's Government required such a clause he would insist that it be inserted l^rom this it would appear that H. 3. was weakening though 0 'eceatedly told me that hetpould not arree unless .ne nationality clause was inserted in the agreement, and he gavels his reasons ^ the same as those he had given Qolonel Biscoe who embodied them }n^Hl'S~'No• 40-T dated at Bahrain 9th November 1930. I certainly gathered, that should H.M. Government decide to give up this clause then, the Shaikh, though acquiescing, would himself put forward the above mentioned reasons as a clause in the Agreement and this he has stated in his reply to Major Holmes, xhe ohaikh to my mind, appeared a bit worried owing to Major Holmes having said that he the Shaikh had promised him verbally-and now he required it in Major T.C.V/.Fowle, C.B.S., lolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire,li v^ri ting. This, I feel sure, is onlv ajflother of this gentleman T s artifices to gain his object, but I do^t think the Shaikh can be hustled. 7 /e have now^in writing ( the Shaikh T s decision, but as it is only a draft letter, I will obtain a copy of the actual reply he sends Major Eolmes.

Our representative found upon nis arrival in Kuwait, after some discussion regarding tne British Control clause, that tne Sheikh was willing to omit the British Control clause, provided Hi s liaj esty 1 s Government were willing to agree the omission. It is the opinion of our representative that the Sheikh has 'been influenced by the pressing demands of the people to develop without delay the natural resources of Kuwait and tue severe trade depression and v unemployment experienced during the past two years &lt;A W &gt; y'/ within the Sheikh 1 s territories have accentuated the necessity to promptly meet these demands.

Before any action could be taken on receipt of t is derpatc^, I r. Jan son of tne Eastern and ueneraX Syndicate called on Sir John Shuckburgh ai^.d s tated t xt t they interpreted tne Shaikh's letter as intimating that subject to tne approval of iii s Laj esty' s Government, ne was prepared to viraive the condition about 3ritisn control. He went on t o say that before taking any action ne was anxious to know what could be done to meet our v/ishes and that if it was made olain to the Americans that % His lajesty's Government was opposed to an American concessicm, they would probably accept the inevitable and ling tieir negotiations to an end. Sir John Shuckburgh told them that the best step would be to write in officially, in which case we would consider what could be done, and ossibly arrange for an informal discission, out refused to commit imself on that or any otner point. We have not yet got tue official letter but Colonel Dickson came in on Saturday and I snowed nim tne despatch and its enclosures. He said tnat ne.w%s not at all sure that tae interpretation put on the Shaikh's letter was the correct one and tiv t it was open to tne interpretation 'I am sick of being botnered by you, so go and talk to tne British Gov: rmnent, and if y ju can get them to agree to anything, come back and we will see about it rt , and in view of this, I think you ought to nave tie stuff now, even though we have not yet got any letter from the Eastern and General Syndicate. Dickson was generally ofof the opinion thhD tne Syndicate, as represented by iolnes, were very persistent and sligntly nderhand negotiators- The matter 'is complicated by tne fact tnat His lajesty's Government has recently decided as a g nersl rule not to insist on tne '•British control clause even in Colonies, S3 it would be lather illogical to insist ujon it in tiis ^articular case but v/e can wait and see.

Both gentlemen are of opinion that the Syndicate are placing an unduly favourable ^from their point of view) interpretation on the Sheikh^ letter and that before any answer can usefully be returned, it is advisable to ascertain exactly what the Sheikh^ intention was. This matter, they suggest, might very well be deferred until their return. 3. 1 have accordingly to request that this despatch may be brought to the notice of Colonel Dickson when he returns in the course of September, and to Colonel Biscoe f s notice on his return later, and that 1 may eventually be real informed of the exact position and the Sheikh^^intentions.

Dated the 3rd October 1931• From Lieutenant-Colonel H. R.P .Dickson, C.I.E., -'^'T^ESiDtNCY To - Political Agent, Kuwait. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. /jTZro /i/io/*! Dai COHriOl'i i i Major Frank Holmes* activities in Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have received intimation that Major F. Holmes is now on his way to Kuwait from England, and has probably by now reached Baghdad. He telegraphed this fact to his Persian Agent in the town. 2. In connection with this individual's activities, I have to report that I recently had two long talks with His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on the subject of his much dis cussed letter of 2nd July to Major Holmes. 0 3. As i suspected was the case, the Shaikh explained that Major Holmes worried him so often and so long, that to get rid of him gracefully, he told him to go and fight the matter out with His Majesty's Government. He felt confident when he wrote 1iie letter that His Majesty's Govern ment would see him through and give the Eastern and General Syndicate a clear and definite refusal to allow any agreement without a British Nationality Clause. He felt, he said, that this would be the easiest way out in dealing with this very persistent person. Arab politeness, he said, forbade that he should rudely 'turn him down', especially as Major Holmes had twice made handsome personal gifts to him in the shape of a £ 1,000 Sunbeam car in 1929, and Rs 10,000/- in cash in 1930. The Shaikh added that Major Holmes was such a 'difficult' person at taking a hint that nothing short of deliberate rudeness to his face, would have had any effect. Arab etiquette of course forbade such a course, especially as Major HolmesJ Holmes was a kind of guest in Kuwait, so he had deliberately decided to write the letter he did, put ting his reliance on His Majesty's Government to step in and do the needful. 4. Lastly the Shaikh assured me that the meaning of the last paragraph of his letter (which incidentally should read as per translation in the margin, and not in the free way given by Major Holmes* lawyer) was that in the possibly unforseen event of His Majesty's Govern ment weakening in the matter of the 'Nationality Clattse', he the Shaikh would himself insert a clause in any J agreement granted to the effect that the Company must V&gt; . ^ be entirely and altogether a British one as he had r V already verbally assured Colonel Biscoe (vide Bushire confidential No. 40-T dated Bahrain 9th November 1930/ to H.M's Secretary of State for the Colonies). The Therefore if you and your Company cone to an agreement with His Majesty's Govern ment on the clauses mentioned to you by me and should they (His Majesty's Govern ment) allow you to omit them, then there will have to be a further discussion with you . v \ same point was emphasised in Dr. Greenway's demi-offi cial letter No. 87 dated 2nd July to the Hon'ble the Political Resident. 5. Whether the Shaikh really meant to do what he says he intended is open to conjecture. But knowing dm as I do that he is easily swayed and not possessed of much strength of character, it would, in my definite opinion, be far too risky for us to leave it at this, and I still Hiink that it must be made quite clear to the Shaikh that we expect him to insist on the in sertion of the 'Nationality Clause'. 6. A point,which in fairness to the Shaikh,must not be forgotten, in judging him over the letter .r business, is that he has had it in writing, vide Bushire ^ confidential letter No.290-S dated 4th August 1928 to the Political Agent, that His Majesty's Government would always insist that any oil agreement come to with^ syndicate must have a British Nationality Clause in it, He was again told this in 1930, vide the Hon'ble the dthe Political Resident's confidential demi-official No. 593-S dated 1st August 1930. He therefore, I think had no reason to suppose that His Majesty^ Grovernment would recede from this view. that Major Holmes (according to tie Shaikh) again and again rubbed it in directly and by suggestion that he, Major Holmes, had had it on the highest authority in the Colonial Office that if the Shaikh did not want the insertion of tbe Nationality Clause, His Majesty's Government would not insist because they would under take to see that his interests «ould and would be properly protected by other diplomatic means. 8. The Shaikh, though one cannot entirely excuse him of weakness and vascillation in this matter is really a simple Bedouin at heart, and there is some excuse for his having succumbed to the continuous and direct attack of a man of Holmes' calibre. 9. The Shaikh's simple faith in us is patheti cally sincere, and if I may suggest it, he can hardly be expected to appreciate the finer points of our diplomacy which apparently in the present case require that he (the Shaikhji of himself should insist on the necessity of a Nationality Clause, while we look on and commend his efforts. 7 Another point worth mentioning perhaps, is I hsve the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Kuwait.CONFIDSNHAL• Political Agency,Ku7mit. , D.O.No.127.

The latter only reached me yesterday midday the 7th October 1931. 2. It is satisfactory to know that the Sec retary of State for the Colonies has decided to await Colonel Biscoe's return. 3. His stay in Kuwait will give us the chance we want, and beyond preparing the ground for him I shall wait for his arrival and ket him tackle the Shaikh himself. ble Major T. C. Fowle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Precis of a cornrersation held at Kuwait on 24th October 1931 between the Honourable the Political Res' lent in the Persian CJulf and Fis Excellency the Huler of Kuwait. The r.ctiTities of ''^,1 or Holmeg and the letter written by the jhaT - h to ::a.1or Holreo dated Ist Jul:; 1931 . (1) m he Hon'ble the Political Resident started by discussing the situation in Arabia generally and other rnatters of local interest, (2) He then led up to the question of Major Holmes cjid the letter which he, the Shaikh, had ^iven to him during the absence of the Political Agent in England. (3) The Hon'ble the Politicr. 7 Resident pointed out thf t ICuw^it was an independent Arab State, and that he, the Shaikh, was an independent 'luler, and that it had always been his, the Political Resident*s, earnest desire to see Kuwait stand on her legs and to encourage him ( the Sliaikh ) not to fear to take responsibility in matters affecting the welfare of the local administration. (4) He reminded the Shaikh that on his last visit to Kuwait he had discussed with him the activities of T^ajor Holmes and the question of foreigners getting into the State. (5) Also that he (the Shaikh) had then in very forcible language, and without in anyway having been prompted to do so, declared that he was entirely against giving any sort of oil or other concession to a foreign Concern, and that if he ever ....(9) • • § * ever did so he would insist on proper safeguards beinj insert in any agreement come to. ^ ^ urtlier 'hat life, the Shaikh, had impressed on him (the Political Resident) that these safeguards would ta're the fcr.n of a nationality c-1 ause or clauses after the style given him in 19 n .8 and 1930 by the Hon'ble the Political Resident ard •'pproved then by His 'ajesty's Government. (7) In view of these spontaneous and very satisfactory assurances which he, the -olitical Resident, had reported verbatim to His Majesty's Government at the end of his visit (vide letter ^o .40,T, dated the 9th November 1930) he, the political Resident, had felt surprise not to say astonishment when he saw in London the Shaikhs letter to Major Holmes. He as ■eel therefore if the Shaikh could in any way explain how he had come to write such a letter, which he must confess did give the impression that it was His Majesty^s Government that were preventing his granting a concession to Major Holmes, ana that if he(IIaJ or Holmes) could only M so ua re 'His ilajesty's aoverninent, he, tne Shaikh, would be ready to grant the concession sought after some further discussion. (8) The Shaikh in reply started by saying that he had never meant to oonTey such impression, and that if the letter were perhaps unfortunately worded his meaning by the last paragraph was obviously that in the unlikely event of His Majesty's Government taking so little interest in his State aa to waive any 'nationality Clause' that he, the Shaikh. •vou^J then 3^ep in and insist on further conditions which In themselves would be as good as a 'Nationality Clause',(9) The lhaikh here seemed to find himself in difficulties and ohvxour:ly ^.ried to avoid further discussion of the letter in question by remarking '♦But enough of the letter, let us coMie down to the actual facts of the situation, w Having oeen invited to speak all that was in his mind, the Shaikh proceeded as follows* (10) He assured the Hon'ble the Political Resident that ^ ' r ' 0 — i' airway at all gone back on his previous state - -rents to h^m. That he was neither a fool nor a liar, and entirely and fully stood by every single word that he had said to the political Resident on his previous visit at the end of 1930. (11) He knew he was an independent Ruler, and was fully awa^e that His -a J e sty * s Oovernment were anxious for him to stand on his own legs in all matters affecting the interests Co. nj.s State, yet he realized today more than ever in the past, that it was up to him to work in co-operation with is I-ajesty's Government. The very existence of Kuwait epended on r is 'ajesty^ Government's continued friendship and advice - and this he would never jeopardise by any foolish act on his part. He feared foreigners and any form of -oreign influence, in his State, and similarly trusted His Majesty's Government and Englishmen generally. How much lore therefore lid he trust in and desire the friendship and advice of the Political Resident, The latter must therefore put away from his mind any suspicion that he, the aikh, had intended to go back on his word to him, (13) lastly as he was an independent Ruler and confidence was placed in him by the Hon'ble the Political Resident, he trusted that His Majesty's -SoTernment would trust him fully-4- in the present matter^ Let them say to him ' Do you 30 rhead and deal with this person 'Taj or Holmes, bearin in. mind your owr interests and 'is I'ajesty 's Government interest.' I shall then pray 'od prove to His Majesty's Government that I not only know my business, but that I can be trusted,* In particular I know how to retain the good-will and friendship of His Fajesty's Government which above all is of value to me and my State. (13) The Pbove and much more by way of protestation was said by the 3haikh, who lastly hinted stronrly that His Majesty's Government should not leave him always to fight his own battles* That as His ''ajesty's Government expected him to act in a certain way, so he expected His Majesty*s Government to not only help and support him morally, but by deedsi ( He of course referred to the delay on His Majesty's Government's part in implementing their promises to bring him relief from. Bin Saud's blockade). My ancestors made treaties with His Majesty's Government, and these have been faithfully kept. ' But I, in ray rei c :n, wish to see His Majesty's Government do somethir.;; for me, beyond giving me moral support.' (14) Throughout the conversation was conducted with the utmost 'riendliness and good feeling* Jated the 26th October 1931 sd/- H.K... .D$ Confid e ntial * British Residency &amp; Consulate-General» Bushire, the 3rd Uoverater 1931* Ko &lt; 19&gt; Sir 9 I hare the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Cunfidential despatch of 14th September 1931, regarding the desire of the fiastern and General Syndicate to obtain an oil concession in Kuwait4 2 # I have recently spent fire days at Kuwait and took the opportunity of discussing the matter at length with the Shaikh in the presence of Colonel Dickson* I began b^ reminding him of our preTious conversation on the subject 9 and told him that I had on that occasion gathered from the manner in which he spoke and for the reasons which he gave that he was just as anxious to insist on the retention of the nationality clause as His Majesty^ Government 9 and that 1 had reported in that sense* X pointed out that the letter nhich he had now given to Major Holmes, while in some ways rather vaguely worded, was certainly susceptible of the interpretation that the onus of responsibility for the retention of the clause rested with His Majesty^ Government, and that if they were willing to waive the clause the Shaikh was willing to do so too. jt 3« 1 then went on to say that after all every man is entitled to change his mind, and that I was really desirous of ascertaining what his personal feelings and views of the matter really were, and I pressed him to speak to me absolutely His MaJesty^s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, L^JON.-8- abaolutely frankly* Shaikh Ahmad began by saying that he absolutely stood \sy erery word he had said to xoe on the prerious occasion, and under no circumstances did he desire the presence of a company other than an English one in his principality, and ^ he reiterated the reasons which I had reported in my despatch Ao 50 .40 -1 of 9th HoTember 1930. 2 then asked him why he had given this letter to Major Holmes and what he actually meant by it. His explanation was somewhat lame and weak and, I think, may be summed up as follows. Major Holmes had for some time past been pestering the Shaikh both directly and through intermediaries to come to terms* His methods are somewhat derious and at time he undoubtedly draws the long bow in his endeaTOur to impress the Shaikh with his own importance and his influence uong high personages in London and America* He has done a certain amount of propaganda 9 among the notables of Kuwait and has assured them that the grant of a concession would bring much money into the principality, and during the present difficult crisis he has found the soil already sown, and deputations have visited the Shaikh urging him to come to terms with Major Holmes, and finally the Shaikh has received two handsome presents from Major Holmes, first a Sunbeam car and later Rs« 10,000* Finally, Just before he was leaving Kuwait, Major Holmes came and called on the Shaikh in person and again made a final effort to get something in writing out of him, and the Shaikh yielding to his importunity and anxious to get rid of him gave him the letter which certainly does not commit him to anything definite but is of that evasive stylte in which the Arab mind seems to delight and may be interpreted in different senses by the writer and the addressee* The Shaikh himself explained the letter by saying that the meaning of the last paragraph was that in the possibly unforeseen event of His Majesty^ Government weakening in the matter of the *• •-3- the nationality clause he (the Shaikh) would himself insert the clause in any agreement granted to the effect that the company must be entirely and altogether a British one* The Shaikh had spoken in this sense to Doctor Greenway, the Acting Political Agent, before sending the letter and I think he certainly felt that the letter did not commit him one way or the other; his explanation however is not conTincing and I think the long and short of it is that he wanted to get rid of Major Holmes* importunities, and therefore gave an evasire reply which really committsd him to nothing said left the matter in suspense* 4* I took the opportunity of reminding Shaikh Ahmad that he had all the adrantages of an independent ruler, since we did not interfere in the internal affairs of his State, and that he must accept some of the responsibilities of that poeition* I em however quite convinced that the Shaikh really does not desire the presence of an American company in his State, and will not willingly agree to any abrogation of the nationality dauee, and I submit that there is absolutely no need for us to bring any pressure to bear upon him in this matter* His Sxeellency told me that just before his interview with me a deputation consisting of some of his relations and leading men of the town had called on him again urging him, in view of the grave distress prevailing, to c ome to some agreement with Major Holmes* But he had given them a very short reply and informed them that in this matter he intended to take his own line* 5* He is very gratified indeed to learn that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company contemplated a geological survey of the State, a fact which apparently reached the ears of Haj or Holmes and had caused him some consternation* I trust the Anglo«Persian Oil Company will not delay in carrying out the survey, * * *•urvey, wbich will strengthen the Siiailch's hand® and f if the survey i» euccessful and results in a definite application by the Anglo-Persian Oil Coapary for a concession, it will eliere the British authorities from the somewhat delicate position in which they bare been placed by the activities of aj or -olmes on behalf of American interests* 6. I should like to mention in conclusion that the Shaikh ^ made a most earnest appeal to me that His lAajesty's Government should take some steps to relieve the blockade which £• yressing V- \% so hard upon this small principality. He reiterated that he had consistently endeavoured to follow their advice end to meet their wishes, and that in return he did think that it was incumbent upon them to relieve him and his people from the grip of Bin Saud* I am sending a copy otf this despatch to the Gover#* ment of India* Z have the honour to be f Sir, Tour most obedient^ humble servant, I Political Resident in the Persian Oulf ivy ATTSSTSD.

Views of Ma.lor Frank Holaes of the Eastern General Syndicate on the possibility o^Oil** being found in Kuwait, Ba hrain and the gulf generally . Sir, I hare the honour to forward the substance of a con- rersation which Major Holmes recently had wiUi me prior to his departure for Bahrain, on the subject mentioned at the head of this letter. 2. I also enclose three sketch maps of the Iraq and Persian Gulf areas to illustrate -wfeA* Major Holmes 1 ideas. 3. I feel somewhat diffident about submitting this repftrt, as the Information contained may after all be common knowledge to people in the n oil n world. Nerertheless as Major Holmes gave them as his own views, and emphasized that certain experts would by no means agree with everything he said, I think it worth while to give you a short resume^ of what he said. 4. In the first place Major Holmes gave it as his consider ed opinion that the re was a close connection between the 'Sii' and the numerous fresh water springs (all of which were warm, some also very hot), which were to be found everywhere in the sea off the on the Islands of Bahrain, North-East coast of Arabla,7on the mainland of Hassa, both in the vicinity of Qatif, and up the whole length of the Wadi al Miyah (valley of waters), which series also obviously stretched up through Kuwait( where they weakened) and the country South of Euphrates right up to the vicinity of Nejef, (as Instance the wells of-2- of Shagra Abu Ghar, Ruhba eto) # 5. This water Major Holmes was of opinion oame from the Persian Mountains and not from the highlands of ^ejaz and Nejd as hitherto supposed, and passing under the Persian Gulf and the lower end of Iraq, at a great depth (as instance the heat ) was eventually forced up again on the line described in the preceding para by a sort of fault in the earth's surface which took the form, to use an easily understood simile, of a great rocky wall or cliff, which came up from a great depth and ran in a North and South A Easterly direction following the general line of the Persian Gulf and the valley of the Euphrates. 6* The same w cliffformation was in the same way trying to help n Oil n to the surface, as witness the w Bitumen w seepages which are to be found stretching from Hit on the Euphrates, past Tel al Mugaiyir (Ur) / Bxirgan in Kuwait territory also Qatif and Bahrain. This line which he said followed the same course as the water springs mentioned in para 4 above. Major Holmes was of opi nion formed the Southern edge of the ,, Oil w bearing zone or line, and it was close to this line that the underground cliff so to speak ran. 7. There was however another probable series of water and oil surface springs, said Major Holmes which took the centre line of the Persian Guif f / and passing through Halul Island, yj Arabi and Ffersi Islands, Qamr Island, Mudaira on the North side of the bay of Kuwait and Jebel Sanam, proceeded in a North-Westerly direction and parallel to the line mentioned in para 6. At all the places mentioned except Jebel Sanam, traces of oil or bitumen springs are / he said, known to exist. 8. The third great oil bearing line said Major Holmes, was of course the well known one which passed through the Kirkuk Shustar region and North of the Tigris and Persian Gulf and went in a South Easterly direction. This line as far as Major Holmes could see probably also took a parallel course to his mid Persian Gulf midland Iraq line / and his Arabian coast and Euphrates line. 9. With the above data to go on Major Holmes was of opinion that chances of striking oil either in Bahrain or at ^atif or in the vicinity of Kuwait, were very bright.10 -3- In spite of the fact that oil oxperts always pretended that siirfaoe oil indications never really meant any thing, he Major Holmes said that he had yet to find an oil geologist who did not carefully follow such indications, or an Oil Company which did not find its eventual n spouter rt in the vicinity of such indications. 11 • As regards the formation of Jebel Dukhan at Bahrain where he was now boring Major Holmes volunteered the statement that never in his long and varied experience, had he found such a perfect example of an oiliferous ^ene - Everything including general strata and formation of the under surface rook etc. etc. promised success. His^ore'' had gone down 800 odd feet or so and already n olly Shales' were been extracted. surface ooze of oil both at w Bahra ,, (close to Mudaira vide para 7), and also in the sea close to Ras al Abid (visible at low tide) near the southern boundry of Kuwait. This apart from the extensiwe bitumen deposits at Jebel Burgan on the Southern border of Kuwait. All of these indicated every likelihood of oil being found if bored for. 7116 attached sketch map the original in the rough of which I persuaded Major Holmes to draw for me, will probably show better than I have been able to explain above, the theories and hopes held by Major Holmes.

You rill appreciate that the Sheiklij of 'oweit is aii independent ruler, ! althouji hi'? special treaty relations 1 ith His ' ajesty's G-overnnent, whose protection enjoys, lead him to seek their advice on important questions -f policy, and have caused him to give them an assurance that he will not grant an oil concession in his territories without their consent. I understand that the Eastern and General Syndicate interpret the Sheikh's letter of the 2nd July last to Major Holmes as indicating t^at he is prepared to grant to the Syndicate a concession m the terrs which they havu suggested,provided only that prior agreement is readied on the subject between His Majesty 's Government an the Syndicate. As I told you in l : letter of the 22nd December, it has al^ 5 appeared to us doubtful v r hether this does in fact represent the Sheikh's intention. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was in England on leave at the time when the Sheikh 's letter to Fajor Holmes was received, was therefore instructed to ascertain/- ascertain from the Sheikh himself at the next convenient opportunity the precise meaning to be attached to his letter. From the report which has now been received from Lieutenant-Colonel Biscoe, r, appears that the Sheikh does not regard himself as in any ray committed by his letter to Major Holmes to £-rant the syndicate the concession ,r hich they seek, even if they succeed in coming to an agreement with His T !aje c, ty' s Government. You ' 111 observe that the Sheikh's attitude on the point is borne out by the final sentence of the letter, which merely indicates his readiness to discuss the . atter further with I'ajor Holmes after agreement has been reached between the -Syndicate and His 'ajest v ! s Government. As the Syndicate are already aware, another company, which had r .anifested interest in Kov;eit oil before the Eastern and General Syndicate had even appeared on the scene, is also considerin 3 the possibility of applying at an early date for an oil concession from the Sheikh of Koweit, and is indeed at the present time carrying out a ^eological exploration of the territory. In these circumstances the Sheikh v ;ill naturally desire the opportunity of considering any application which these other interests : ay rake ana, should such an application be addressed to him, sufficient time will be required for a careful consideration of the relative advantages/1 advantages offered by the two applications, 'before he reaches a dedsion in a matter which must greatly affect the general prosperity of his State.

Dear Warner, Thank you for your letter of yesterdays date enclosing a draft of the letter v/hich it is proposed to send to the United States Charge d 1 Affaires in regard to the proposed oil concession in Kuwait. I think the reply is generally on the lines agreed at the inter-departmental meeting held last week, but it occurs to me that it might be possible to strengthen the paragraph on page 3 of the draft and I would suggest something on the following lines in substitution for the first sentence of that paragraph: n As the Syndicate are already aware, another Company is also considering the question of applying for a concessicn from the Sheik of Kuwait. I may say that this company manifested an interest in ioiwait oil and indeed made a formal application irr a concession before the Eastern and General Syndicate had even appeared on the scene. ^t that time the negotiations were not brought to a satis factoiy conclusion, partly because of difficulty over the terms of the concession thus affording an indication, that in the matter of the development of the mineral resources of Kuwait, His kajesty's Government is concerned to give the best possible advice to the Sheik in connection with any applications for concessions which he may receive. The company referred to has, however, not lost interest in Kuwait and is at the present time, with the sanction of the Sheik carrying out a geologiceL exploration of the territory'.' Yai may also like to consider the following two further suggested alterations* (a)/ F.A. Warner Esq., Foreign Office, downing Street, S.W.I.7 • • • • (a.) Paragraph 2 of tlie draft&gt; Lines 6 and 7 to read 'policy and caused him many years ago to give them an assurance that he would not grant an oil concessi ai (This alteration is intended to mcke it clear that this assurance was given before the Eastern and General Syndicate came along) . (b) Paragraph 3. I would suggest omitting the y/ords 'even if they succeeded in coming to an agreement with His Majesty's Grovernment', which appear near the bottom of page 2. If Oliphant were seeing Atherton again on this matter, I suggest that he might, without offence, put it to him that the activities of the Eastern and General Syndicate in Kuwait and Bahrein have not always been carried on on the same lines as other companies adopt and that by direct approach to the Sheik they have endeavoured to secure undertakings and promises by somewhat doubtful means. You will remember that in connection with Bahrein, after the Eastern and General Syndicate had been given quite a good concession, they came along again, before they had done any serious work, and pressed to be given rights over the whole of the territory, thus seeking to exclude any other company from a share in any oil which might be found in that territory. It looks as if they intend to do the same in regard to Kuwait. There can surely be nothing unfair in His Majesty's Government taking the line that to allow such a position to arise would not, until more definite information is available regarding the supply o± oil, be in the best interests of the rulers of these territcries.

Dear Warner, I delayed replying to your letter of the 6th of January No.E.6414/325/91 about the oil in Kuwait because Starling rang me up on the telephone and said that he was suggesting some verbal alterations. He has now sent me a copy of his letter to you and I write to say that we concur in the draft with btarling's amendments, subject to the following alteration:- In the long sentence which Starling v/ants to insert on page 3 of the draft we think that the words, 9 lines down, 'partly because of the difficulty concessions which he may receive' are rather self- righteous and would like to amend that sentence to make it read 'at that time the negotiations were not brought to a satisfactory conclusion chiefly because the terms suggested were not satisfactory to the Sheikh'. This has the merit of being shorter and preserving the suggestion to which Starling attaches importance, that it was the Sheikh's wish and not ours. In addition we have an alteration of our own as follows - At the top of page 2 of the draft it seems advisable to expand the question of the Sheikh's real 4 intention COPY i- J K ' AIH MAIL at I 5 JM7v intention and we suggest the addition of the following words after the words 'the Sheikh's intention' 'especially in view of the very emphatic terms in which the Sheikh has consistently expressed himself on the subject tothe local British authority'. We are further inclined to agree with Starling that if there is any further interview between Sir Lancelot Oliphant and Mr.Atherton, Sir Lancelot might suggest that the Eastern and General Syndicste are not reallj'' the sort of Company which we like, since they are not themselves direct exploiters of petroleum and avowedly intend to get rid of their concession as soon as they have got it, while the means they have adopted in dealing with the Sheikh are perhaps a little doubtful.

Ur. Atherton, after mentioning the temporary difficulties which had arisen in the couse of the Syndicate's negotiations in regard to the Bahrein oil ccncession on the question of the inclusion of the 'British nationality clause', referred to the reappearance of the same difficulty in the discussions regarding the proposed ccncession in Koweit. According to his inlormation, while the Colonial Office had infomed the Syndicate that the stipulation as to the inclusion of such a cLnse was made by the Sheikh of Koweit, the Sheikh had informed the Syndicate that there must have been some misunderstanding, since he had never made such a stipulation. Llr. Atherton added that, although your department, upon bein^amrOached in the matter by the Syndicate, had replied that a further communication would be addressed to them w as soon as possible', no such communication had in fact been received. 3. Under the instructions of hiaGovemment, I'r. Atherton said that the State Department desired to emphasise the right of United States interests to particulate in conceaaions The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office. TconcesBions in Koweit on an equal basis to British interests. The State Department did not wish however to i r 3ply by this that they were desirous of favouring any one United States interest as dietinct from some other. Mr. Atherton expressed the hope that your department would, in view of the above, be able to address a satisfactory statement on this matter to the Eastern and General Syndicate. I 4. Sir John Simon hopes that Sir Philip Cunlifle- Lister will be willing, in view of the represnntations made by Mr. Atherton, to have expedited the reply of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the despatch, a copy of which was enclosed in your letter o. 89178/31 of the 14th September. I am also to enclose a draft of a letter, which Sir Join Simon proposes, subject to the observations of Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister to address to Mr. Atherton, in order to correct certain inaccuracies in his statement of the present position of this matter. 5.

My dear Atherton, In the course of our conversation on the ^ December, you raised the question oi' the application Eastern and Greneral Syndicate tobe granted a con cess: respect of exploration for oil in Koweit. I find on enquiry that some doubt exists as to the correctness of the interpretation placed by the Syndicate upon the letter adn'ressed to their representative, Ilajor Holmes, A by the Sheikh of Koweit on the 2nd July, regarding the inclusion in such a concession, if it were granted, of a clause stipulating that the concession should not be transferred to a non-British company. In these circumstances it has been necessary to obtain a report from the Political Resident in the Persian U Gulf and the Political Agent at Koweit before any further co;nraunication can be made to the Syndicate, Steps are however beiat; taken to ensure that this report is received with the least possible delay, and a further communication will be addressed to you as soon as it has been received and considered.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOYERNMEN1 EASTERN (Arabia).

Telegram No.384 of 3rd February from Secretary of State for India. KIMAIT OIL. 2. Reference paragraph 4 . Oil interests are unlike ordinary commercial concerns. They have infinitely larger resources frequently wield much political influence and demand much more extensive concessions. For instance in draft concession submitted by Holmes to Shaikh he sought not merely permission to explore X / / / s s and prospect for oil but to construct roads, railways, ports, lighthouses, telegraphs and telephones and to establish coaling stations. If foreign companies* operations approached scale of Anglo-Persian Oil Company establishments at Abadan there would be enormous influx of foreign labour, much of it of an undesirable type. Shaikh could certainly not exercise control and we should have to assume charge. After company had obtained control of all means of communication transport etc. in state Shaikh would be puppet in their hands. While I do not attach much importance to risk of isolated incidents of which foreign nationals would have to take their chance there is always possibility of dis turbances on large scale such as occurred four years ago and as may well recur if Ibn Saud's kingdom breaks up. In such event Royal Navy could not protect establishments in hinterland and foreign interests might well call on their own government for protection, ...protection, and very difficult situation would arise. Further if foreign interests obtained footing all down Arab littoral their Government might consider it desirable for their warships to show the flag. In any case Arab Shaikhs would in short raJKcZ time look to foreign interests who would doubtless not stint X money than to British Government as dispensers of favours and we should lose to large extent that influence which we now exercise and the whole position which we have labo/iriously built up would be threatened. Having regard to strategic importance of Persian Gulf nowadays it would seem Essential to avbid this risk. 3. As regards particular case of Kuwait discussions hitherto have been Icerbal. I would suggest that Political Agent should write to Shaikh to effect that his letter to Holmes is somewhat ambiguous and seems to be at variance with the views expressed verbally to me. His Majesty's Government would therefore be glad to know whether Shaikh is fcr is not prepared to grant concession to company controlled by foreign interests. If he replies that he is not prepared to do so I presume it is not the intention of His Majesty's Government to force him and reply could be communicated to Americans, emphasis at the same time being laid on his independent status and fact that we do not interfere in his internal affairs. - RESIiffiNT - p -aConf identiai. ■-^Y, Mo. i 1 . 28a-H/2t fl'.

Ex tract will be found in Lorimer's Gazetteer Volume I Part I page 369. It will be noticed that even then suggestion that our efforts should be di-rected towards exclusion of legitimate trade of other Powers was emphatically repudia ted. If we attempt to define what cohstitutes lefitimate irade we can find nc more satisfactory criterion than that which is genuinely beneficial to interests of principalities in Gulf region. 3. proceeding on this line, although we must admit force of many/ arguments and anticipations to which BisCoe has given expression in his telegram of 7th February No. 93, and are under no illusion that if conce^ion were granted it would ^ prove unmixed blessing either for Koweit or for His Majesty's Government and ourselves, yet drawbacks which he pictures are likely to arise in matters incidental. Moreover some of them at least could be avoided by maintenance of good relations with foreign Government concerned. If attention ' is confined to essentials, we incline to opinion that, sueject to certain reservations, balance of advantage lies in admiss ion of American interests. For if project does not develop, no harm will have ensued. If it does, engagement of American capital on considerable scale in Gulf will make for stabil ity and world peace, which we regard as His Majesty 's Govern ment's and our own supreme Interest, and protect 0xO v promote local prospGrit/y R-ncl doveloprnent v^/lt/h v/hlch both thoy and we are especially concerned. We therefore agree to omission of British control clause. 4. We are addressing you further on various aspects of this nuestion hy mail, hut desire to take this opportunity of offering certain observations for your immediate consider ation and communication to Foreign Office, if you accept cur views. 5. In first place omission to have made proper provision at Bahrain for exclusion of foreigners has undoubtedly queered Koweit pitch and we are inclined to think that it was perhaps mistake of tactics to attempt to raise nationality bar question over Koweit agreement. In view o: Shaikh's tortu ous attitude it is anyhow now no longer possible ^ c pretend that objection comes from him and at present juncture we therefore advocate dropping this line altogether. 6. This however is by no means to be construed as acquiescence in immediate grant of concession in proposed form. Shaikh has not yet signed anything and is under nc obligation to give any concession at all to Eastern ana General Syndicate, unless they are prepared to offer him ternx which are genuinely to his advantage. If he can get better offer from A.P.O.C. or any other quarter he is quite at liber ty to accept it. It might now, we suggest, be represented to American Ambassador that our chiel concern is not so much with questions of nationality as to secure best terms possible for Shaikh of Koweit and other Arab Rulers of Gulf whom we regard as our wards, and our opposition to admission of foreign interests hitherto has been at least in part based on anticipation that they would prove less amenable to our guidance than British concerns. Approaching question of Kov : eit concession from this stand point ' e notice that terms are open to criticism on many points in that they are too vague and comprehensive, giving too much to Syndicate andand reserving too little for Shaikh. Detailed examination of proposed lease fol ows by post, hut discussion of main issue need not perhaps he delayed for that. N. and U.D4 M.

Atherton stc -ted his imderstanding that on th t occasion ;ir Lancelot Oliphant had replied that he had no information on the particular point out tht Mr. Atherton*s representation would oe brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities, with an idea of deterraining whether Ar* ^thepton's pos sibly unaue apprehension was in fact founded. In the course of a subsequent conversation ir Lancelot informed Mr. Atherton that he understood th t the activities of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had in fact increased auring the month of ' ecember, since, in fact, the beginning of the conversations between the Foreign Office and the American j tnba. sy on the question of a Koweit oil concession.

Sir Lancelot Oliphant replied thet he had no knowledge of this increased activity by English companies in Koweit, whereupon Mr. Atherton asked that the matter might be brought to the attention of the approprif te authorities, together with the fact that he could not but feel from this latest information that his representation made on December 29th as set forth above was indeed founded. On February 26th Mr. Atherton called hy appointment on Sir Lancelot Oliph nt at the Foreign Office and under instructions stated he desired to emphasize the opinion of his Government as to the correctness of the views that Mr. Atherton had exprersed to Sir L ncelot Oliph nt on December ^9th f as set forth ^hove, and to urge that the activities of the Company in Koweit be suspended pending the receipt of a reply to the representations first wade through the American Kmbassy in London on December 4th and subsequently continued by Ambassador Dawee nd .r.

The proposed concession agreement appears to me to he open to so many serious objections that, apart from the question whether ultimately this Syndicate will obtain a concession at all, I strongly recommend that this form of agreement should be scrapped entirely. It may be too late to advocate the introduction in Koweit, and elsewhere in the PersiM Gulf, of agreements following closely the lines of the draft prospecting licenses and mining leases given in the Indian Mning Rules. But we must realise that in agreeing to a concession in any particular terms now, we axe in effect agreeing to the type of Mining Rules that should apply to Koweit territory; and the absence of any such rules appears to necessitate that cm agreement for the grant of mineral concessions in Koweit territory should be self-contained with its own embodied mining rules, as in the case of Mi scat and Bahrain. As I have said above, I strongly recommend scrapping the present draft agreement and the drafting of a new one following the general form of the Muscat and Bahrain agreements with such additions as seem necessary to make them conform more closely to the necessities of the case as judged by our experience in India.lie (v\£) 17. How with reference to the terms of the proposed concession agreement of which two forms are presented and of which it may 1)0 presumed that the Sfyndlcate would prefer the second edition as it is of later date. The chief ohjections appear to me to 'be as follows t- (a) The use of the term 'conceded territories* appears to he open to the gravest objection» as the use of such a term would do mor ^han anything to create an imperium in imperio . The form used in the earlier edition i of the proposed agreement namely 'Kbweit territory* appears to me hardly less objectionable* No necessity for any such terms was discovered in the Muscat and Bahrain leases» where the term used is 'leased area 1 in small letters 9 and it seems to me exceedingly undesirable to make use of any terminology 9 the mere existence of which would help to usurp and derogate from the authority of the Shaikh and give the inuression locally that a new power has been created? consequently if this form of lease is to be retained, 'conceded territory 1 should be replaced by 'leased area' in lower case throughout. (b) In clause 1,paragraph 3t the right to select 640 sq* miles is granted, under what should be termed a mining lease. Whatever area be specified here, there should be an explicit statement that at the end of two years, the exclusive right to explore and search the territories of the Shaikh for natural gas, petroleum, etc. should cease outside this area, and that, in addition, this agreement is not at any time to operate to prevent prospecting by other persons for other minerals either within or without the leased area. (c) With respect to the area, I agree that it is excessive, and that a reduction could be induced by charging an appropriate rent. In our mining leases we provideprovide for rent charges for two purposes. Surface rent is charged only for land actually occupied for mining opera tions, buildings, etc. and depends upon the local rates of rent in force, and if rent is to 'be charged for the whole area of this concession, it should not be called surface rent, but minimum dead rent; there would then seem to be no reason why the rate so charged should be lower than the rates given in Schedule C of our mining rules, from ^lich it will be seen that the minimum dead rent should be Re • 1 per acre for the first 10 square miles, Rs • 2 per acre for the next 40 square miles, Rs* 5 per acre for the next 50 sq* miles and Rs. 10 per acre for the excess over 100 sq« miles. The footnote to the Schedule states that these minima are purposely fixed low, but they are liable to be largely exceeded, according to the value of the deposit and degree of development of the country. It will be agreed that as this is completely undeveloped country, the minimum rates cited above should not be enlwuiced in the present case* Ems on an area of 640 sq. miles the minimum dead rent would amount to Rs. 30 ,49 ,600, a sum which seems absurdly high, and would nn/doubt deter any company from attesting to acquire a concession over a completely unproved area. The teaning of this is, of course, that prospecting and mining eriods arc mixed up in one lease, as a result of which a much greater area is being sought for inclusion in this concession than would be finally held on mining lease, if a- period were provided for prospecting, during which a fee * not exceeding one rupee and not less than one anna per acre would be leviable under our rules. A fee of two annas per acre would amount to Rs. 51,200 annually over 640 square miles, and might be regarded as suitable if joined with a minimum royalty of Ri« 50,000 as recommended later. (d) Clause 1, para* 5, prescribes a period of 70 years for the concession. This would be in addition to the 2 yearsyears proTlded for exploration. I suggest the reduction of this period to a figure conforming with our customs in India® namely a maximum period of 30 years with a clause permitting renewal for a further period not exceeding 30 years f with provision for a revision at the time of the renewal of the rate of royalty. On this point I should mention that the MUscat and Bahrain agreements provide for revision of the royalty after 10 years. The omission of any such provision in the present les^ae appears indefensible. In addition# there should be provision for a prospecting period prior to the grant of this mining lease; and as we know prospecting licenses for oil are apt to he extended for many yeers before mining leases are taken out. (6) Clause 2 (c). The righto granted to the leasee for water should not be such as to interfere with the possibility of other prospectors subsequently searching for oil or searching for other minerals at any time. There is no easier way to block the work of other people than to obtain control of water resources. (f) Clause 4. The Shai&amp;i retains the right to grant permission to others besides the company to import oil and lay pipe lines for these purposes. It is meet important that this provision should be adhered to. (g) Clause 5 appears to me to be thoroughly objection able# as its retention in this form would preclude the exercise of the right of pre-emption for oil in time of war either by the Shaikh of Kowelt or the British Oovernment. The rate of export customs duty on oil exported should# of course# be levied not on the value of the oil at well-head as provided# but on the value of the oil and its products as exported# especially if under clause 6 the company is to have the right to import free of customs duty# the machinery# plant and materials required to enable the value of the crude oil to ber /&lt;3 (\7^ be enhanced 'by refining. Or? whether \% is suitable rate A I eaqpress no opinion. (h) Clause 7. It has already been suggested that surface rent should be charged over the whole area of the concession. I have suggested above that instead a minimum dead rent should be charged over the whole area and in addition surface rent where ground is actually occupied. (i) Clause 3 contains no provision for advioe to the Shaikh concerning the terms of transfer. This clause should, I think* provide that the British company or com panies to which the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. desire to transfer their rights should be approved by the Shaikh acting under the advice of the British Government# AS the term 'Oanadian 1 is included in British 1 , I suggest that the words •or Canadian 1 should be deleted. (j ) Clause 14. This contains no provision that on the abandonment of any excavation pit or any well by the company § such excavation pit or well shall be properly fenced or enclo sed. (k) Clause 15. For the grant of such an enormous concession what amounts to a salaami of Rs. 30,000 appears to be a con^letely inadequate sum, and unless the maximum ar«a to be leased is grjat^ly reduced, I suggest that this figure should be enhanced to one lakh. In addition, a sum of Rs. 20,000 prescribed as an annual payment thereafter seems also completely inadequate. Ae this sum is subsequently to give way to royalty, it is evident that It represents a miniiaim royalty, that is, a minimum dead rent, which at the rates prescribed in our Indian rules would be, for 640 sq. miles, Rs . 30,49,600 as we have seen abovet If the final \ area to be retained were# however, limited to 100 sq. miles, the minimum dead rent would be reduced to Rs# 1,9 3,600, and if the concession were split up into separate blocks and each assessed for dead rent and royalty separately, then the total mini mm/'M minimuia dead rent would be much smaller. Thus on 5 blocks of 20 sq. miles each, the minimum dead rent would be Ks. 19200 x 5 » Bs. 96000, It seems impossible, therefore, to reconmend that this figure of Es. 20,000 should be en hanced to less than 1 lakh even with a leased area restrict ed to 100 sq. miles. If, however, it were decided eventually to treat this concession in a different way from that pre vailing in India and to exatct a permanent dead rent to continue irrespective of payment of royalty,then I should suggest 2 annas an acre permanent dead rent over the whole concession, as suggested above in paragraph 17(c),and a minimum royalty of £s* 50000 in addition. (l) Clause 16. It is evident from this clause that the Es. 20000 which, I suggest, be increased to Es. 50000, is by way of being a minimum royalty. (m) Clause 17. If the minimum royalty be left at Rs.20000, until the company declares that it has found oil in commercially exploitable quantities, which raay be assumed to be in the opinion of the company the quantity of oil that should produce Es. 70,000 as royalty at the rate prescribed, then as fis. 20,000 corresponds to 5/714 tons and Es. 70,000 corresponde to 20 , 0 00 tons, any quantity between these two figures in excess of 5714 tons would escape paying royalty at all, until the company had declared its success in finding oil in commercially exploitable quantities. I may mention that the rate of royalty of Es. 3/8/-per ton agrees with the royalty charged in India of annas 8 per barrel on the basis of 7 x 40 • 280 gallons to the ton. AH that is necessary is to amalgamate clauses 16 and 17 to the effect that the royalty is to be atEs. 3/8/- per ton subject to a minimum royalty of Es. 50 , 0 00. (n) Clause 19(b) contains no provision for the deposit of plans and information with^the Shaikh on abandonment of the work. Also this clause would require radical modifi cationmodification if the lease be remodelled to conform to the Indian lease of 30 years with right of enhancement of rate of royalty on renewal for a further 30 years. (o) Clause 21 does not suggest how the Shaikh's arbi trator is to be selected. I suggest that it should provide that the Shaikh in such a case should receive expert advice and that his arbitrator should be approved of by the Poli tical Ag en t at Koweit. 18. In addition to the points enumerated by rae above as the result of perusing the lease consecutively, there are others of which by far the most important is the right of pre-emption in time of war concerning which I strongly urge that a clause be inserted. 19. In addition, a comparison of this projected agree ment with our standard form of mining lease shows the following omissions:- There is no clause analogous to Part III, clause 4,of the standard form of mining lease; perhaps this can be omitted. Part IV, clause 2. Liberty to make railways and roads is not reserved. Part VII, clause 2. There is no reference to the demarcation of boundaries. Part VII, clause 6. There is no provision for inspec tion on behalf of the Shaikh. Part VII,clause 5. Ko provision exists for reporting accidents: there will be no expert body to whom such re ports could be made; nevertheless good government requires that the Shaikh should know what happens in his territory. Part VII,clause 8. There is no provision to report to the Shaikh the discovery of other minerals. Partfib Part VII, clause 13. Ko provision for payment of compensation for injuries to third parties. Part VII, clause 14. Ho provision that the company shall noai not obstruct the working of other minerals; this might prove a serious omission if other prospectors discovered other minerals in the area leased for oil. Part^II,clause 18, which is the British control clause of Indian leases, l8,d)f course,missing,as also clause 20 of Part VII, granting right of pre-emption in time of war,and clause 9 of Part IX granting power to take possession in event of war or emergencies. 20. Apart from the numerous specific defects in the fliaft agreement between the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. and the Shaikh of Koweit,my chief objection to this agreement is that it appears to be in a form that will not work. There is no provision for an adequate prospecting period and this appears to be the raal reason why it is necessary to provide for the selection of so large an area as 640 sq. miles. If this agreement were to be remodelled on the lines of the Muscat and Bahrain agreements so as to provide for an exploration period of 2 years with a possi bility of extension, and a prospecting period of 2 years also with the possibility of extension for the reasons given in the Muscat and Bahrain leases,we should be pro viding the company with a longer period within which to selectjthe tracts they require to take up on mining lease and the total area to be granted could then be much smaller. In additionalth the provision of a longer period for exploration and prospecting, the period of the Mining Lease could be reduced from 70 to 60 years, split up into 2 periods of 30 years, as already suggested,and if this is to be done, it will be seen that by far the simplest procedure, in view of all the objections, is to start with the material of the present Bahrain agreement and modify it so as to take account of the various points brought out. XXX X X' ' : (^0 IV. Ri^ht of ^re-emption Clause * 25. I note that the Anglo-^e rsia n 0 il Company are again in the field and the ma-Ives be applicants for a xqacBMXXc concession. This shouldbe welcomed; but if eventually a portion of Koweit is granted to the Eastern and Oeneral Syndicate Ltd., in spite of their entanglement with an American Company, it will evidently prove impossible, in view of the -Sahrain precedent, to include a British control paragraph. Ife verthele ss, this should not preclude the addition of clauses providing the right of pre-emption and possession in case of war. I noticed somewhere on the file the suggestion that if the company were registered as a British company, this would automatically render possible British control in case of war. Our previous experience in dealing with the Syndicate shows that anything not specifically included will be difficult to claim later and I suggest for consideration that though the Goverment is prepared to waive the Britidi control c^^use, they should insist on the explicit inclusion in the concession of a clause providing right of pre-emption. V. Chief Local Representative . 26, If a concession for a portion of Koweit is eventually granted to the Sastern and General Syndicate Ltd., and transfer is permitted to American interests on conditions similar to those arranged in the case of the -^ahrain^lea se, providing for a shadowy sort of British control with provision for a Chief Local Representative, I venture to suggest that Government should object to Ifejor Frank Holmes being Chief Local Representative in Koweit as well as in Bahrain. It has already been suggested in these papers that it is impossible for him to carry out satisfactorily . idsatisfactorily his duties as Chief Local Representative at Bahrain if he spends a considerable portion of the year elsewhere. This provides sufficient reason for objecting to his holding the same post inKoweitf and in the event of the Government adopting this point of view, I suggest that provision should be made for a Chief Local Repre senta^ive who is a persona grata to the Government, as in the c^se of the British Director of the -Bahrain Petroleum Company.j ^■-r ^ ^ ^ f Extract from D.O.

(No. 389.) gi r Foreign Office, March 30, 1932. Mr . ATHERTON saw me this morning- with reference to the transfer to the Eastern Gnlf Oil Company of the oil concession which the Eastern and General Syndicate are seeking to obtain from the Sheikh of Koweit. General Dawes had mentioned this matter to me last December, and I had referred what he had said to the Colonial Office. Mr. Atherton indicated that the State Department were concerned at the lapse of time which had taken place without a reply from the British Government, especially as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a rival concern, has been in the meantime conducting geolooical investigations in the area, and has been following these up by an expedition equipped with drilling machinery and plant. Mr. Atherton left with me a note which he had been instructed to deliver, and observed that inasmuch as a satisfactory arrangement had been made in reference to Bahrein, his Government considered that there ought to be no objection in the case of Koweit. I explained to him that my own absence at Geneva had to some extent delayed the reaching of a conclusion on the matter, but that I had, since my return, been studying it afresh. Several Departments were interested in the question and I hoped to have the opportunity of bringing the matter before the Cabinet at its next meeting in a week's time, after which T would communicate with him again. I am, &amp;c. JOHN SIMON. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Atherton to Sir John Simon. United States Embassy, London, March 29, 1932. ACTING under instructions, I have the honour to inform you that m\ Government recalls the enquiry which it made through this Embassy in 1929 as to the policy of His Majesty's Government in the matter of the holding and operation of petroleum concessions by American nationals in British-protected Arab territories such as Bahrein. His Majesty s Government is aware of the solution subsequently arrived at in the specific case of the Eastern and Geneial Syndicate which, on behalf of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, was at that time seeking a modification of the so-called ' nationality clause, the inclusion ot which in any oil concessions granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein was being insisted upon by the 'Colonial Office. The arrangement then agreed upon had appeared to my Government only just in view of the extremely liberal treatment accorded in the United States and in its possessions in reference to the operation ol petroleum concessions by British companies. My Government had therefore supposed that the policy of His Majesty's Government would be no less liberal in the matter of according open-door rights to American nationals in Koweit than it had shown itself to be in the almost identical case of Bahrein. The American Government sincerely trusts that it has been correct in this assumption and would appreciate an earlv indication that such is the case. My Government understands that it is the policy of His Majesty s Govern ment to require the companies seeking concessions in Arab States, such as Koweit, that such companies obtain the prior consent of the rulers of such States to the entrv and operations of such companies in the territories in question. The American Government is informed that contrary to the impression that seems to [408 gg—1]have prevailed in the Colonial Office, the Sheikh of Koweit is understood to be quite agreeable to the specific entry of the Persian Gulf Oil Company and to the granting on behalf of that company of an oil concession without the inclusion of the ' nationality clause. The American Government trusts that, in view of the apparent willingness of the sheikh in this matter, His Majesty s Government will see its way clear to taking up, in the case of the Koweit concession, no less liberal an attitude than was assumed in the case of the Bahrein concession. The American Government understands that, despite the fact that the Colonial Office as early as 1925 gave its full and unqualified consent to the nego tiation by the Eastern and General Syndicate of an oil concession with the Sheikh of Koweit, that office later qualified its consent by insisting upon the inclusion of the nationality clause in any agreement arrived at with the sheikh for the apparently specific purpose of preventing the entry into that territory of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, which had meanwhile arrived at an under standing with the syndicate as to the transfer of any concessions that it might obtain from the sheikh. The continued insistence of the Colonial Office on this point and its apparent unwillingness to accord to that syndicate the same treatment as was accorded in the case of Bahrein has seriously handicapped the syndicate in bringing to a conclusion with the sheikh the negotiations which that concern was authorised by the Colonial Office to undertake. The above situation' is further complicated by the fact that at the very moment while His Majesty's Government had under consideration the petition of the syndicate for the elimination or modification of the nationality clause, permission was granted the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, a rival concern, to send a small partv of geologists to Koweit for the purpose of studying the surface geology of the ground. It will be recalled that this Embassy on repeated occasions requested 01 the Foreign Office that the company in question should not be permitted to proceed with Its operations, pending a decision by His Majesty's Government on the question then before it regarding open-door rights for American nationals in Koweit. Now my Government has been informed that this study of the surface creologv has been followed by a second expedition equipped N\ith drilling machinery and plant. The Government of the United States greatly regrets that no effect has been given to this Embassy's request in this matter, but would appreciate being assured by His Majesty's Government that this fact will not be allowed to militate against the position of the syndicate and its affiliate, the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, in the eventual granting of an oil concession in Koweit.

S ection 1. ^32 ! [E 1733/121/91] No. 1. Sir John Simon to Mr. Atherton. I J n/ij gj r Foreign Office, April 9, 1932. WITH reference to your note No. 1696 of the 'i&amp;th March regarding the application of the Eastern and General Syndicate for an oil concession in Koweit, which they propose, if granted, to transfer to United States interests, i have the honour to inform you that His Majesty s Government have given caretul consideration to the representations made by General Dawes and yourseli on this subject, and I am now in a position to return you a reply. ou -i v # 2. Your Government will appreciate in the first place that the bneikh or Koweit, though an independent ruler, is in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government and enjoys their protection. These special relations lead him to seek their advice on important matters of policy, and place His Majesty s Government under an obligation to watch over his interests. Many years ago the predecessor of the present sheikh gave an undertaking that he would not giant an oil concession in his territories without their consent. 3. In paragraph 2 of your note of the 29th March you mention that \oiir Government are intormed tliat the sheikh is agreeable to the entr} of the Eastern Gulf Oil Company and to the granting on behalf of that company ot an oil concession without the inclusion of the nationality clause. As was explained to you in a semi-official letter of the 22nd December last from my Department, His Majesty s Government, on learning this, felt some doubt as to the correctness of this interpretation of the sheikh s attitude, since the sheikh had consistently expressed himself emphatically to the local British authority as desirous of confining any oil concession to entirely British inteiests. In youf letter of the 30th December you were good enough to transmit for my information a copv and translation of a letter from the sheikh to Major Holmes, the repre sentative of the Eastern and General Syndicate, on which the American interests apparently based the information on this point given to your Government. Majesty's Government have caused enquiry to be made of the sheikh, who replied that he was still averse from receiving in his principality a company other than an entirely British one and' that he did not consider himself as in any way committed by his letter to Major Holmes to grant the Eastern and General Syndicate the concession which they seek. It will be observed from a reference to the sheikh s letter that its final sentence only expresses a readiness to discuss the matter further with Major Holmes after agreement has been reached between the syndicate and His Majesty s Government. i • i 4. When examining the necessity for the continued insistenceon the inclusion in any oil concession in respect of Koweit of a clause confining it to British interests, His Majesty's Government have been concerned not only with their own interests' in the matter, but also with their duty to secure the best terms possible for the Sheikh of Koweit, and, in particular, have had regard to the possibility that it would be less difficult for the local British authorities to control the activities of a purely British concern and to reconcile them with the sheikh s interests. On a balance of all the conflicting considerations. His Majesty's Government are, however, now prepared, for their part, not to insist in this case that any concession must contain a clause confining it to British interests, if the sheikh for his part is willing to grant a concession without such a clause. 5. I wish, however, to make it clear that this decision does not imply agreement in the immediate grant of the proposed concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate, to which'the sheikh, as stated above, considers himself in no way committed. His Majesty's Government indeed do not consider that they could properly advise the sheikh to give prior or preferential treatment to the Eastern and General Syndicate, but hold it to be necessary that any application for a concession which may be forthcoming from any quarter be examined with [435 i—11 '—^ 1 L j I WEEKLY LRTTER No. 21 APR 1932 FROM 8E0RETARY, POLITICAL ANf SEGH tEPT. INDIA OFFICEa view to decide which, if any, will best serve the interests of the sheikh and his principality. 1 should add that the draft concession submitted to the Colonial Office by the syndicate would in any case need revision, both in respect of the provisos designed to safeguard the interests of His Majesty's Government (clause 8) and on many points affecting the interests of the sheikh. 6. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of your note of the 29th March you have referred to the operations now being carried out by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Koweit and reminded me of the requests made to my Department that this company should not be permitted to proceed with its operations pending a decision by His Majesty's Government as to the exclusion of all but British interests. I would explain that the Angio-Persian Oil Company manifested an interest in Koweit oil, and, indeed, made a formal application for a concession before the Eastern and General Syndicate had even appeared on the scene, though the negotiations were at that time not brought to a conclusion, chiefly because the terms suggested were not satisfactory. Several months before any representa tions were made by General Dawes or yourself in the matter, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company made a request for permission to carry out a geological survey in Koweit with a view to decide whether to submit an application for an oil concession. In order to ensure that any oil concession which the sheikh may grant shall embody the best available terms, it is, in the view of His Majesty's Govern ment, desirable and proper that any interested companies be given every opportunity in advance of satisfying themselves, whether or not they wish to submit an offer. His Majesty's Government therefore raised no objection to the grant by the sheikh of the application of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. I understand that their present activities in Koweit are confined to such a geological survey. 7. The position therefore is that His Majesty's Government, for their part, are prepared to agree to the omission from any oil concession, which the sheikh may be prepared to grant, of a clause confining it to British interests. ]f, therefore, the Eastern and General Syndicate desire to renew their application to the sheikh for a concession, which they would subsequently transfer to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, His Majesty's Government w r ill raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration together with any other applica tions for oil concessions which may be forthcoming from other quarters.

Activities of Major Holines . yjr- HI In continuation of my confidential Despatch fl* No.53 dated 15th April 1932 and para 8. I have the honour to inform you that Major Frank Holmes arrived from Bahrain on the 27th April,(see also my D.O. No.60 dated 2S.4 32.) and dined with his Excellency the same evening. 2^ Holmes called on me on the iollowin^ ^ay the 28th April, and i returned his call on the 29th April. s At this second meeting, i found Major Holmes in cheerful and talkative mood. After discussing certain topics of general interest, which included a rather unnecessary set speech in praise of Mr Mellon the American Ambassador, who was described as the most popular man in England to—day, he made a gratuitous attack on yourself and Political Officers in general, whom he styled 'out of date persons who think of nothing else but how to maintain their personal power over local potentates',(«• ajor Holnies . ^ graciously excluded me from his remarks!} 4^ After about twenty minutes of this sort of thing. Major Holmes changed the subject and with an air of childish triumph called his confidential clerk, who produced a telegram (typed out and without date)which he (Major Holmes) said he had just received from the Eastern General Syndicate .uondon. The wording of the telegram was to the effect that the Gompanys11^ Companys ^erioan principals had been informed by the .americain State Department that the London Foreign Office had addressed them as follows on the subject of the Kuwait oil Concessio n, c^ote , 'H.IvI.G. on their part are prepared to agree to the omission,from any oil concession which his Excellency the Sheikh of Kuwait may be prepared to grant, of a clause confining it to British interest; if therefore the Eastern General Syndicate Ltd.,desire to renew tljeir application to His Excellency the Sheikh of Kuwait for a concession, to be subsequently transferred to the Eastern G ulf Company, (underlined portion, actual words as far as my memory serves me) H.M.G. will raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration, together with any other application for an oil concession which may be forthcoming from other quarters w unquote- 5. . Major Holmes then handed me an official letter(in duplicate) addressed to myself, the original of which I am forward ing as an enclosure to this. The letter speaks for itself, though you wil] doubtless observe that there are two important omissions. (a) Firstly Major Holmes makes no mention of the Eastern Gereral Syndicate Ltd having received their so called extract of Foreign Offices letter, from America, but on the contrary he states that H.M.Go have been in direct communication with the Eastern and General Syndicate and have supplied the extract quoted, direct to them. (b) Secondly . He has been careful to omit the words under lined by me in the original telegram^ Both these omissions to my mind are significant, as without them the letter appears fairly straightforward, and if shown to the. Sheilh as it undoubtedly must have been by now, will convey the impression that H.M.G. has come to an agreement with the Eastern General Syn dicate, and will no longer insist on the British Nationality clause. This in itself can be counted not to alarm the Sheikh, as any mention of the news having comefrom America, ((a),above)or that that any con cession granted could subsequently be transferred to an ^imerican concern pure and simple,(b,above)would certainly be calculated to dodo* 60 The olever part of Major Holmes letterto me, which I repeat he mustbhave already shown to the Sheikh,lies in the fact that the Sheikh must now think that Holmes and his hackers are more powerful than he ever gave them credit for and that they have forced H»M.G,to go back on their original decision to insist on the National ity clause. This I submit will not only shake the Sheikhs faith in us badly but knowing him as I do will certainly set him wondering whether he can really count on that assistance from H.M.G., which he « 1 hopes and expects to get in other important matters such as the n Date tr tt Gardens^ and blockade questions. 7. That Major Holmes believes that he has triumphed wass very evident from his subsequent conversation for, he talked about the n wonderful victory' that his company had now won and quite openly described the Foreign Offices letter as w t he most abject climb down that i t had been his fortune to see ', and admitted that he never thought 'they would surrender like this'. 'What did astonish him', he added,'was the way the Admiralty had raised no objection'. 8. On the other hand Major Holmes seemed annoyed,(if indeed he was not acting a part,) at the inclusion by his company in the telegram that was sent him, of the words 'To be subsequently transferred to the Eastern Gulf Company'. He declared that he did not approve of such wording at all, nor would he tell the Sheikh or ask him to agree to the insertion of any such or similar clause in any agreement entered into by him, as that would be going against all the promises made by himself to the Sheikh, which were to the effectii to work the concession^ that though the money might be found in America / the company A would be a British one and would refer to the British Government only, and to no other in the event of any difficulties or dissagreements arising between it and the Sheikh. ■ 9. This curious attitude of Major Holmes struck me as very strange, especially when he turned round and begged me not to divulge the underlined portion of his telegram, or what he had said about it to me. It is possible of course that we have here the begin nings of a breach between Major Holmes and his principals, but I am inclined to think that he was trying to pose as the champion of the Sheikhs interests and so get me on his side.4. . n°@ ■ side* i, IQ # » During our subsequent talk Llajoir Holmes touclieJ- on the^famous' Arabic letter which he had got out of the Sheikh during my absence in England last year. He appeared to think that he had done a very 'smart' thing, and admitted that he had only waitedtt till I went, to bring off his 'coup'. 'I knew' he said, ,T that I could( get past Dr Greenway, a good but simple sort of fellow'. When I suggested that to decent people his conduct on that occasion savour ed distinctly of the 'shady', he denied that this view could be takei by any sensible person. ^ Having given you the substance of my talk with Major Holmes, I would ask that I be favoured with very early orders,as to how I should reply to his letter to me. Major Holmes is aware that | I am referring the matter to you and you can rest assured that he has already given the Sheikh a translation of his telegram from the Eastern General Syndicate, omitting those portions mentioned in pure 5 above as well as a copy of his letter to ne. xf it is an actual fact that H.M.G. have also told 1 Major Holmes Company, the Eastern General Syndicate London, that they can go ahead now without a British nationality clause, the onjr course would appear Nfco be to tell the truth to the Sheikh and to allow Major Holmes to reopen negotiations for his oil agreement. Both parties however should be informed officially, and for pref erence by you direct I think, that H.M.G. still reserve the right to examine and approve of the actual terms of any agreement come tbo before it is signed by either party. In this way only can we insure that the Sheikh gets a fair deal, does not sign away his birthright and that our interests are safeguarded. 13# i am sending you 4 copies of this despatch.

I am to refer, in the first place, to the letter which the Sheikh of Koweit sent to Major Frank Holmes on the 2nd July, 1931, a copy of which was enclosed in your letter of the 4th August, 1931, and which you interpret to mean that the Sheikh is willing to omit the British control clause from any concession which he may be prepared to grant to your Company, provided that His Majesty's Government are also willing to agree to its omission# Feeling some doubt as to the Th£ SECRETARY, THE EASTERN AND GEHERAL SYNDICATE LIMITED. ^ v .r ^ A v- &gt; r 37&gt;;J- ,the correctness of this interpretation of the Sheikh 1 s attitude, since the Sheikh had consistently expressed himself emphatically to the local British authority as desirous of confining any oil concession to entirely British interests. His Majesty's Government that he was still averse from receiving in his principality a company other than an entirely British one and that he did not consider himself as in any way committed 'by his letter to Major Holmes to grant to the Eastern and General Syndicate the concession which tliey seek. It will be observed from a reference to the Sheikh's letter that its last sentence only expresses a readiness to discuss the matter further with Major Holmes after agreement has 'been reached between the Syndicate and His Majesty^ Government. 3. His Majesty's Government have now considered the question in all its bearings and have decided that, for their part, they will not insist in this case that any concession must contain a clause confining it to British interests• Whether the Sheikh for his pc.rt is willing to grant a concession without such a condition caused inquiry to be made of the Sheikh, who replied is i YHAT;iiHOa ;iaaT8Aa $ CCTiYE.YHATSHOSu ; lH5Cr8A£ 3;IT 16'? is therefore now a matter entirely for the Sheikh's decision. It should, nevertheless, he made clear that this decision of His Majesty's Government does not imply agreement in the immediate grant of the concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate, to which the Sheikh, as stated above, considers himself ir. no way committed. His Majesty's Government indeed do not consider that they coul d properly advise xhe Sheikh to give prior or preferential treatment to the Eastern and General Syndicate, but hold it to be necessary that any application for a concession which may be forthcoming from any quarter be examined with a view to deciding which, if any, will best serve the interests of the Sheikh and his principality. 4. The draft concession which you have already submitted would in any case need considerable revision, (a) in respect of the provisos designed to safeguard tne interests of His Majesty's Government which will need considerable amendment on several, important points; and (b) in respect of many points affecting the interests of the Sheikh. 5. 5V7 5, If, therefore, the Eastern and General Syndicate desire to renew their application to the Sheilch for a concession, His Majesty^ Government will raise no objection to the application being taken into consideration together with any other applications for oil concessions which may be forthcoming from other quarters♦ I am.

Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. The Hon'ble the Political Resident in liie Persian Gulf, Bushlre. Ma.jor Holmes* Activities . N 1 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I duly received your telegram No # 286 dated the 23rd May, and passed on the contents under official letter to Major Holmes. 2. I enclose fcr your information a copy of his reply to me dated 84th May 1932. 3. Major Holmes saw me on 25th May at 11 *00 A.M. and said 12ie Shaikh was lunching with him at noon when he intended showing his new draft n concession ,, . 4 # On my asking him whether it was the same as the one he had previously submitted, he said '♦no - nor does it follow the Bahrain Concession, in as much as the Exploration Prospecting and Mining Licences are not mentioned separately, but are merged into one concession'. mi 5. Bearing in mind what you told me on your last visit about these three licences, and that it was customary to mention them separately in any oil concession sou^it for, I enquired why he had made the alteration. His reply was that the Bahrain concession had turned out to be most unworkable and cumbersome, because of the three different licences having been mentioned separately.|G1 —B- Major Holmes tiien proceeded to show me the draft concession which he was about to show to the Shaikh* As I i*rtusC^\. had less than a quarter of an hour to read it through, I naturally could not take in much. 7 # Three things I did note however, (a) Major Holmes offered RsSO^OOO/- to the Shaikh a year instead of RslO f OOO/- as given to the Shaikh of Bahrain. (b) The nationality clause was of course non existent; instead there were clauses per mitting the concession to be sold to a third party provided such were registered in Great Britain or Canada. (c) Major Holmes was to be Resident Director for the Persian Gulf as a whole (i.e. Kuwait and Bahrain). 8. When I said to him that I presumed the third party would be the American Eastern Gulf Company, a branch of which would be registered in Canada for the purpose, he admitted that this was probably so. 9. I then asked if he had a spare copy of his draft agreement which I could study, and send on to you. He replied that he had not, but would get one ready and let me have it in due course. 10. In case Major Holmes tries to make out later, as he is quite capable of doing that, he showed me the draft agreement before it was presented to the Shaikh, and that I passed no adverse comments on it - I widi to make it quite clear, that I only had a bare 10 minutes in which to read it, and was quite unable in such a short time to take in anything except one or two main details* The impression I did get however was that there were several highly objectionable clauses still. 11. Immediately previous to his showing me the draft agreement. Major Holmes touched on the Anglo Persian Oili^ 5- 4 a~ JL 011 Compaiiy, while emphasizing that he never spoke against a sister company in any way, he said that in his opinion and in the opinion of many better men than himself, the A # P # 0.C. were w doomed n « That it was only a question of time now, when Russia would come forward and demand of Persia Uiat she throw out the A.P.O.C. lock stock, and barred (his words). When this demand come, as it would assuredly come within the next 5 years, he said, no resistence could or would be made, for His Majesty^ Government would not go to war merely for the A.P.O.C 1 s sake. After the 'crash*', Bahrain would come into her own, for he (Holmes) was absolutely confident that oil would be found there, in large quantities and he would see to it that such oil was not lost to the Briiidi Government or the Royal Navy. 12. The above pretty sentiments, as well as the 'dreadful fate' prophesied for the A.P.O.C., are I think worth passing on to you, as they diow Major Holmes* methods of progress.

Sir, With reference to recent demi-official correspondence concerning the grant of an oil concession in Koweit to 71 ' Americ interests, 1 am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to forward for the information of the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs a copy of a memorandum which has been prepared by the Admiralty on the question of the application of the British Control Clause to this territory. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Colonial Office, India Office, Air Ministry, Petroleum Department. l am. Sir, Iomt obedient Servant, Sd/- S.H. Phillips. The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office.r2r\ . Secret OIL CONCBSSIOH IN KOY^EIT CMemorandum by Admiralty j Hepresentationa naving been made by ttie U.S.A. Ctiarge d* Affaires on tkie subject of tue grant of an oil concession by the Sheik of Koweit to Major Holmes ia British subject) on behalf of American interests, it is now necessary to decide whether or not the Sheik should be advised or permitted to waive what is known as the 'British Control Clause' in any concession he may grant. in this connection it should be remarked that the Sheik is, by virtue of an undertaking specifically given by his predecessor, precluded from granting any concession at all without the consent of iiis Majesty's Government. The right of iiis Majesty's Government to insist upon the retention of the 'British Control Glause ,, is therefore clear on the basis of this agreement quite apart from the Sheik's other treaty obligations to us ana, furthermore, would appear to marcn wita the Sheik's personal inclinations. 2. in Telegram P.Z.710/52 of 3rd February, addressed by the Secretary of State for India to the Government of India, it is stated that the .Foreign Office is now M on general grounds strongly in favour of waiving the British Control Clause' 1 in any concession which may be granted by the Sheik of Koweit. In the same telegram the 'risk of possible complications result ing from necessity of having to protect foreign interests in a British protected State on mainland of Arabia' is referred to, but the opinion is expressed taat 'if this difficulty were explained in advance to the U.S.A. Government it might not in itself be a conclusive reason for excluding AmericaJ interests. The Admiralty, on the other hand, consider that the probability of such complications and the possible magnitude of the difficulties arising therefrom provide in themselves sufficient cause for insisting upon the maintenance of the 'British Control Clause'. There are, however, in addition strategical objections to allowing a potential oil supply soconveniently situated to pass out of British, control. 4. One of the moat important duties which would devolve upon the JNavy in time of war would be that of ensuring delivery to the various parts of the Empire of the many millions of tons of oil, which, even under the most drastic system of rationing, will be required in order not only to enable the armed forces to maintain their mobility but also to permit the civil populations to continue in operation their essential means of transport. The total production of oil from territories or by companies under British control amounts, at present, only to a fraction of the estimated minimum annual wartime consumption of the Empire, it is of the greatest importance that this fraction should be increased in order that the ability of neutrals to obstruct our supplies may be reduced. Moreover, it is of special importance that our sources of supply should be strategically well placed and from this point of view Koweit ia of N particular interest as it is exceptionally favourably situated, furthermore, oil fields there coula be much more easily protected than those in Persia or even Iraq. -British control of the development of these fields is therefore particularly important. 5. The main source of supply at present under British control is the Anglo-Persian field in South Persia whose f product ia shipped from Abadan at the Head of the Persian Gulf. The naval dispositions made to protect supplies from this source would concurrently afford a considerable measure of protection to supplies emanating from any other ports in the Persian Gulf. The acquisition therefore of further sources of supply under British control is particularly desirable in this area. Koweit owing to its proximity to Abadan is exceptionally favourably situated in the area. Furthermore, should the Anglo-Persian output for any reason be interrupted, Jioweit would provide an immediate and convenient alternative. qbxxxjd&amp;oueax -6-.(T h)^ 6. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to empliasise the vital importance of bringing under British control at least sufficient potential output to ensure the mobility of our armed forces in war* 3y as much as further supplies can be brought under our control by so much will the task of the navy in war be lightened and the security of the Empire improved* 7« On broad strategical grounds, therefore, the Admiralty are very strongly of opinion that British control of oil development in the Persian Gulf generally, and at iLoweit in particular, should be retained. 8. On the subject of the complications which the advent of purely America^, interests into the x^oweit Sheiicdom is likely to create, the Admiralty are in general agreement with the views expressed by the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, in his -telegram to the Secretary of State for India, dated 7th February 1932. They also concur in the opinion expressed in the letter iio.5156/30 of 11th September, 1930, to the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies by the Secretary of State for India that he 'adheres to the view which he has consistently taken in the light of the considered opinions of the Government of India and the local Political Authorities as to the complications &gt;v likely to arise from the activities of Americajt oil interests in the Bahrein Archipelago'. The Admiralty are of opinion that the complications liable to arise from the operations ?v of an America^ Company on the mainland of Arabia might well be of considerably greater magnitude than any which would arise in the Bahrein Archipelago. ^hile nxXbuut^xtiULfc noting that the Government of India are not wholly in agreement with the views put forward by the Political Resident, the Admiralty find themselves unable to agree that the arguments put forward in their telegram *lo. 623 of 25th February 1932, provide adequate reasons for this change of outlook. 9. -From the peace point of view also the Admiralty are therefore convinced, in the interests of security and the maintenance of general tranquility in the Gulf, of the desira- bility of retaining tHe iJritiah Control Clause in anyconcession which may be granted by the SheiK of Koweit. 10. It will be recollected that the Committee of imperial Defence at its 250th Meeting on September 29th, 1930, had under consideration a memorandum CC,I.D.1017-B) prepared by the Petroleum Department of the Jioard of Trade in regard to the entry of foreign capital for the development of oil production in British territories and that subsequently the Cabinej^t approved in principle the policy proposed by the President of the Board of Trade in the memorandum. iVhen agreeing to the reference of this memorandum to the G.I.D,, the Admiralty pointed out that they were not in agreement with all the arguments and conclusions contained therein and, further, that they consiaerea it essential that conditions (c), (d), ie)» if) and (g) in paragraph 6 of the memorandum should be retained and, if necessary, strengtaened. in paragraph 30 of the Appendix attached to the memorandum, which presents the views of the Government Departments, it was agreed that 'as regards general oil policy in territories such as Bahrein, His Majesty^ Government must reserve the right to consider each case on its merits'*. !!• The Admiralty while fully appreciating the difficulty of excluding America^ interests from participation in the development of the oil industry in Koweit are strongly of opinion that the terms upon which their participation should be permitted require the closest consideration and that in addition to the conditions contained in paragraph 6 (c), ^d), i e )» if) and (g) of C.i.D. Paper .NO .1017-B, endeavour should be made to ensure that over 50&gt; of the capital of the Company shall be British owned ana that we should insist upon the local Managing Director being a British subject. 12. in connection with this question, the following quotation from Captain Mahan, U.S..Navy, is of interest and may be of value in discussion with the U.S.A. Charge d 1 Affairess- 'A concession in the Persian Gulf by arrangement, or neglect of local commercial interests, which now underlie political and military control, will imperil Great Britain's naval situation in the22nd inarch, 19532 • Dear Warner, Than]; you for your lottGr of tlia 18'th i&lt;l£irch cnciosing' copy of the interim reply which Oliphant hao sent to Atherton# We have now received from the Aomiralty and the Air Ministry copy of their memoranda on Kuweit and i understand that you would be glad to have any observations which we may have to offer upon them* You will remember that when you sent me t with your letter of the 3rd March, the draft reply which it was proposed to send to Atherton, I expressed the view, in a conversation which we had on t;;e telephone, that it aid jlo 4 seem necessary to inform tho Americans that we no longer insisted on a British Control clause® 1 should li^e t put this on record because in your letter d the 4th March to Cunningham you only nentien that the J etroloum .Jepai ti-ent wished to make one alteration rfgarding the date on which the Anrlo-Persian had macie their request to be allowtd to carry out a geological survey, and the impression nay have been created that we were otherwise in favour of the draft. As I pointed out at the naetiug held at the Foreign Office on the 11th Karch, the whole question of the policy of the British Grovermaent in regard to oil concessions had been under review and the proposed new policy is included in a memorandum prepared by the etroleum .Departient which had been approved by the various Departments concerned and also in principle by the Comjolttee of Ii^perial defence and the ^ Cabinet. The Cabinet, however, intended that this memorandum should be discussed at the last Imperial \ Conference but apparently this waa not found to be possible owing to pressure of business# I suggested a* ' e foreign Office/r r Office Conference that what had been decided in the interests of British territories generally should be also in the inter ats of any territories which either accepted British protection or British advice in regard to xoatters such as oil concessions* Until the new policy has been finally endorsed by lUU. Groveminent, there is a difficulty in intimating to the American CrovermDentUBt we have the whole of onr policy under consideration and hope to be able to discuss with them a modified basis which we hope will be acceptable to than aid which would lead them to regard the British J &amp;aplre as a reciprocating country under the provisl ons of their Oil Leasing Act, 1920. The (jiestion of the status of Kuweit is not a mtter upon which the etroleum itepartment will be expected to express any views, but if the suggestion I made at the Foreign Office Conference is accepted it does not seem to me to matter very much because if we are not in a position to insist on the insertion of some form of British control claus we can at least suggest to the Sheik that here is something that wc consider desirable in the case of tenlto. lea which are definitely part of the British i!$&gt;ire # and I imagine he would not be likely to Ignore advice of that kind. The admiralty, apparently however, want to go, in the case of Xuweit, rather further than we suggest is necessary in the case of British territories and to insist that more than 50 per cent, of the capital of any company which lay be given a concession shall be British owned. If H. (JovernrraBnt deoide that the position of Kuweit is so important, from a defence point of view, that this additional safeguard is really necessary # we have nothing further to say. I think # however, we should bear in mind that the conditions already included/included in the memorandum by the Petroleum Department are very stringent and there may be seme difficulty in inducing the jnerican Government to accept them as a reasonable basis for admitting the British Empire as a reciprocating country# As things are at present it is possible for &amp; me foreign capital to be invested in British companies ich obtain oil concessions in the iSmplre and really the only change in policy is the withdrawal of the ban agd. nst companies which may contain more than 50 per cent# oi for eign capital* It seeins possible, however, that, provided the Admiralty and the Air Ministry could accept the position of a majority of foreign ca ltal being allowed, a way ou of the difficulty might be found by ^he inclusion in the Kuweit concession of a British control clause on the lines suggested in the Petroleum Jepartiaent 1 s memorandum. We should then be able to keep our policy in line, when the time comes for discussing the general question of reciprocity i ith the Aoericans# I do not think the remaining conditions shouid present much difficulty. The iiastem and General Syndic ate have raised no objection to having a company registered in Canada and this would comply with Condition (d) of our Memorandum# They have also accepted, in the case of Bahrein, the Condition that one D1 ector and the company^ chief local representative shall be British aibjects and that as many employees of the Bahrein Petroleum Company as is consistent with the carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheik of Bahrein. This substantially complies with Condition (c). As regards Condition (f), which relates to ^ * oil companies now usually prefer, for economic reasons, to refine as much as possible at the point of production si tee the/i the transport of crude oil for refining elsewhere and the subsequent distribution of the refined products involves additional transport costs. There should y I think, be no great difficulty on this point# We may have to say Kuweit instead of British Territory^ The right of pre-emption mentioned in Condition (g) only arises in the case of an emerge ncy» It would doubtless be an advantage to have this condition in a concession but in the event of trouble we should, I have no doubt, see that the oil in Kuweit was kept under our control whatever was the basis of the concession# But as the condition would presumably appear in the concession in the form that the Sheik reserves the right of pre-emption, that would avoid any mention in this connection of H.M# Government# Yours, &amp;c., (Sgd. ) ^C. 3TAHLING#Confidential. ^// No»75» Political Agency, Kuwait. t -io.

I am sending a copy of this letter to the CrOTernment of India. I have the honour to be 9 Sir, lour most obedient 9 humble servant, Jf ^T ^ £/ Lt.Colonel, « Political Resident in the Persian Oulf* His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, fc COLONIAL 0F7ICS, ^7 hsMS*'Sf British Residency and Consulate-tieneral t Bus hire, the 10 th June 1932&gt; Ho. Sir, j.11) 1 I have the honour to invite a Reference to my / despatcih Mo. 20 of the 7th June, with which I forwarded a draft of the concession presented hy Major Jfrank Holmes to the Shaikh of Kuwait, and to submit herewith certain comments thereon# 2c This is the third concession that Major Holmes has suhmitted to the Shaikh since I have 'been here. The first was . forwarded to you with my despatch 3fo. 38 of the 17th September 1930• The second was sent with my demi-official letter Ho. 298 -S of the 26th May 1931 to Sir John Shuckburgh as I was on the point of leaving for England. The general conditions of these three concessions are similar, and I would invite attention to the suggestions put forward in my despatch ^ Mo. 42, dated the 6th October 1930, which with the exception of the reference to the nationality clause, apply equally to the present concession. 3. The chief distinction between the three con cessions is in the area to be leased. In the first concession no specific area is mentioned and the refer ence throughout is to Kuwait territory: in the second the area is 640 square miles divided into as many blocks as/ His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.-t' - 2 - i 5) i as the Company chooae #iile in the present concession the area is no less than 1640 square miles. 4 # The prerious concession was «ery seyerely i /0 ■ criticised by the Director of the Geological SurYey of India from the technical point of view# I would venture to state that I entirely agree, from the political point of view, with his view that the expression ^conceded territory' is open to the gravest objection, and with that expressed by the Government of India that anything suggesting an imperium in imperio should be avoided, and that it should be definitely laid down in the agreement that the Company's employes shall be subject to k ! administrative and legal authority of the Shailch to the same extent as other foreigners resident in Kuwait territory. 5. The area of 1640 square miles would certainly seem to be very excessive, but if the proposal made by the Director of the Geological Survey of India is accepted and a dead rent charged, it will presumably be very considerably reduced, 6« Doctor Termor points out that clause 5 would preclude the exercise of pre-emption in time of war, • ifclner by the Shaikh of Kuwait or the British Government. As it is proposed to insist on this right of pre-emption —•vide your telegram Ho. 3, dated the 9th May 1932— I presume this necessary amendment will be made. In para graph 26 of his note the Director of the Geological Survey of India has further suggested that His Majesty^ Government should object to Major Frank Holmes being Chief Local Representative in Kuwait as well as in Bahrain. I entirely agree with this view. The Company have apparently struck oil in Bahrain and it is probable that they will in consequence in the near future consider ably extend their operations and increase the number of their employes. If so, there will be many matters of detail arising for discussion between the Company and the Bahrain Government, and it is e8seri1i £gl a 1[^a' fclocal Representative of the Companty should be perwanent ly located at Bahrain. At preseHt Major Holmes only visits it periodically, and it is obvious that he cannot attend to the work in Jaahrain if he also occupiei a similar position at &amp;tf ?ait* I mafr mention that I do not Qonilider MaJ or Hollies a particularly desirable person, and should be glad to see him replaced by some one else in Bahrain when occasion offers. In any case, however, he should not be the local Kepresentativc in Kuwait. 7. I would suggest that in view of the opinion expressed by the Director of the Geological Survey of India in paragraph 15 of his note an entirely fresh concession should be drafted embodying those hif his suggestions which His Majesty's (Jovemment consider desirable to incorporate and also the safeguards and that it should be discussed with the Syndicate in London on the understanding that it does not necessarily bind the Shaikh. I regard discussions out here as very unsatisfactory, as the Shaikh is a child in the hands of Major Holmes, vtiile neither Colonel Dickson nor I possess any technical knowledge.

In the light of the information contained in Colonel Dickson's letter, the Secretary of State is now disposed to suggest that the Politics.! Resident should be asked to proceed with the preparation of a revised draft concession which will be available for the consideration of His Majesty's Government if the Sheikh of Kuwait decides to dispense with the 'Britisn control' clause, and to consider further the grant of a concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate.

Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political Agent, Kuwait.Letter dated 17th Rabi II 1»544 (4-11-25), from the Shaikh of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait, conveyed the former's consent to the exercise by the latter of jurisdiction over the subjects and protected persons in Kuwait of all non-Muslim Foreign Powers. It is further amplified in the excnange of letters between the two,forwardea unaer cover of P.A f s. memorandum No. 424/32/11, dated 12-12-2o. This is satisfactory vis a vis the Shaikh but under sec. 8 (l) (2) of the Kuwait Oraer in Council the Political Agent f s jurisdiction extends only over non-.Muslim such foreigners * with respect to whom the Shaikh of Kuwait and any State, King, Chief or Government whose subjects or under whose protection they are have agreed with His Jtfajesty for , or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction by His Majesty.* As in 1926 - vide India Office letter No. P.808, dated 11-3-26 - so at present, no Foreign Power has con sented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Kuwait by His ^Majesty, and the Govt, ol ( P t F'£.Jd&amp;-r nrc Zio-rf, India orders^are that when the necessity arises steps should be taken to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desire that tne case should be dealt with under the Order in Council. This state of affairs has hitherto led to no inconvenience but it will in the event ol the influx of a large number of Americans into Kuv/ait and, ii It is necessary, it would be as well to obtain tne torraal consent of the U.S. Govt, to the exercise of jurisdict- -ion over its subjects in Kuwait by His .Majesty. It will be seen from Foreign Office letter No. S.2406/31/9^ d. 11-4-22, to the Colonial Office that the Foreign Office considered this point in 1922. I have said n if it is necessary' in the pre- -rceding paragraph because an alternative mucn to be preferred, if it is practicable, would be the amendment ofoi ^ec. 8 (i) (2) of the Kuv-ait Order in Council to read ^ tne same as the conesponding section of the Bahrain ' Oraer in Council i.e. omission of the necessity for the consent of Foreign Powers. So far as the subjects of non-Muslim Powers are concerned the right of jurisdiction ceuea to H.M.G. by the Shaikh of Kuwait is no less than that ceded by the , i t* • /t I Shaikh of Bahrain, and if in Bahrain H.M.G. xaniiixexercises such jurisdiction without the prior formal consent of • i? 01 eign Pov.ei s it seems illogical to seek such consent in the case of Kuwait. Further, it seems to me that the attempt to secure such formal consent from , say, the Govt, of the U.S.A. in regard to Kuwait would lead that Government to question the right of H.M.G. to act without it in the case of Bahrain. Section 6 (2) of the draft Bahrain Order in ' /T' 7 7// Council arawn up by the Govt, of Inaia in 1911 contained a restriction similar to that contained in sec. 8 (l) (2) of the present Kuwait Order in Council. The Foreign (P*c. tiMJy oi . /Z- 3-Co' /-Oj) i^i 5 b' f Office howevfr helc in 1912^that the section was unneceee- / r -arily elaborate, that our right of jurisdiction over foreigners was claimed ky under grant from the Shaikh and not under agreement with other Foreign 2bkkxx Govts, con- -cerned and suggested the form v/hich was eventually adopted i.e. ignoring the necessity for the consent of Foreign Powers. In a personal letter d. 26-11-12, Col. Trevor /- ~~L pointed out to Sir P. Cox the objection that a Foreign ^ Pov^er might make to this assumption of jurisdiction by H.M.G. but the point does not seem to have been pursued further. The war intervened and the introduction of the Order in Council was delayed for many years. In 1922 the F.O. had the same set of facts . before them as in 1912 but drew the opposite conclusion. It is a decade later now, and perhaps too late ever to go back to the outlook of 1912, but if it can be done it would save a deal of trouble not only in regard to Kuwait but probably also In regard to Bahrain.£ Si</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000265_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/639</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000265</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/639</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 86/1 II (D 78) Kuwait Oil.

This leads to substantial correspondence on the matter between the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the India Office and the Government of India, as well input from the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Petroleum Department over the need for such a clause and the military and strategic implications of non-British interests in Kuwait.Also included with this correspondence are letters between the Foreign Office and the US Embassy regarding the United States of America's concerns that Americans are being excluded from negotiating concessions in Kuwait, and their expectations that any concession in Kuwait should be on the same terms as those granted in Bahrain.Further correspondence and documents of interest include:A new draft agreement, drawn up following the decision to drop the Nationality Clause (folios 180-204);Copies of correspondence regarding the question of jurisdiction in Kuwait over non-Muslim foreign powers and referencing an agreement by the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1925 which granted the power of jurisdiction to His Majesty;s Government;The Senior Naval Officer's confidential proceedings of 31 May 1931: 'The status of the Islands of Farsi, Harkis, Al Kuran and Arifi';Correspondence relating to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company who are undertaking a geological survey of Kuwait and considering whether to apply for a concession;A letter by Colonel Dickson, Political Agent in Kuwait, detailing a conversation with Major Frank Holmes in which he outlines where he believes the oil to be in the Persian Gulf, and including, on folio 58, a sketch map of the three principal oil lines that Holmes believes to exist (folios 55-57);Proposed amendments to the clauses of Holmes second draft agreement (found in IOR/R/15/1/638), written before the agreement to drop the Nationality Clause was reached, written by Dr Fermor, Director of the Geological Survey of India (folios 114-126);A letter from the Air Ministry, 19 March 1932, requesting assurances that all possible steps will be taken to maintain the British position in the Gulf and highlighting the need to safeguard oil supplies as they are the main propellant of the RAF (folios 133-134);Memorandum by the Admiralty expressing their concerns over future complications which could arise in the Gulf and their strategic objections to potential oil supplies not being in British control, and outlining current arrangements for obtaining and protecting those supplies (folios169-173).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Eastern and General Syndicate Limited, oil company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Embassy to the United Kingdom, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Kuwait</topic></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military policy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000265#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
