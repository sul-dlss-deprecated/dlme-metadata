The recent meeting at Dhuid between ohaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, Regent of Kalba and Shaikh Muhammad bin ’Ali of the Bani Qitab tribe brought pressure to bear upon Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr about the allowance due to the first. On 20th Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr sent his brother to request the Shaikh of Ajman and uhe She ikh of Um al Qf iwain to mediate. The above t*o Shaiichs agreed to mediate provided Shaikh Sultan abided by their decision. They were then joined by Shaikh sultan bin Salim and arranged a meeting between Shaikhs Khalid c&gt;nd Sultan bin Saqr in Ajman. On 24th the Shaikhs of Urn al !^aiwain,Ajman and Has al Khaimah sent for Shaikh Sultan bin Seqr and Shaikh Khalid and heard their case in the Shaikh of Ajr.ian’s Fort. They found Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr to be in fault but requested shaikh Khalid to forego part of the amount due to him on account of arears. The case was decided as follows and the parties agreed to abide by it:- (a) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr to pay Rs.1000/- in settlement of Rs.1650/- due to Shaikh Khalid and his brother ’Abdullah, and to rn^ke regular payments in accordance with terms of the agreement* (b) Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr also admitted that the house (Gharbi) in which he is living in Sharjah, belongs to Shaikh Khalid ; nd ’Abdullah and will surrender it to them whenever they wanted or pay its value according to the valuation of experts. 3. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr then asked Shaikh Khalid to enter into ’Ahad al 1 AsabahCdefensive and offensive alliance) but he deferred the matter until six months to see if Shaikh Sultan would carry out his obligations faithfully.

In the course of talk the Shaikh of Fujairah advised Ali bin Abdullah whose daughter the Shaikh of Fujairah is going to marry soon that the Bani Qatab should adopt a better attitude towards the British Government# Ali bin Abdullah said that the Bani Qatab have been the victims of the Qawasim intrigues and requested the Shaikh of Fujairah to speak to me about the intention of the Bani Qatab to change their attitude# On 23rd Septembei^*Shaikh of Fujairah went to Dubai to pay a c courtesy visit to the Shaikh# Ali bin Abdullah came to Sharjah in disguise to see me but as the Shaikh of Fujairah was at Dubai he did not disclose his name but went back^aving one of his men behind to inform the Shaikh of Fujairah on his return# The Shaikh of Fujairah returned from Dubai on 25th# On 28th September Ali bin Abdullah sent a special messenger that both he and Shaikh Muhammad bin AH Chief of the Bani Qatab, were wait ing to see hinCDhaid on his way back to Fujairah. The Shaikh of Fujairah left for Fujairah on 29th but camped at Muraqabbat where he met Ali bin Abdullah and went to Dhaid to see Muhammad bin Ali# I gave the Shaikh of Fujairah a friendly and polite message to Ali bin Abdullah and thanked them for their attitude. On the Id Day (i.e# 1st October) Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali declared in a large gathering of all the Bani Qatab at Dhaid that he would no longer be a victim of intrigues# That whatever work the “Saiyid 11 (Residency Agent) asks them to do within their area which stretch es from the f, Sabkhah rt (means near the Coast) to Buraimi they would gladly do for him or the British Government. That he was sending Ali bin Abdullah to meet me to give a pledge^pn his behalf which will be binding on the Bani Qatab. On 2nd October Shaikh of Fujairah sent me a special messenger from him and one from Bani Qatab that Ali bin Abdullah was with im at Muraqabbat and asked whether he should send him to me to Sharjah# I thought that as he had already ceme to Sharjah it would not be polite to ask him to come and went to Muraqabbat in the evening on 2nd October and returned from there at night# Ali bin Abdullah said that Muhammad bin Ali wanted to see me and arranged with the Shaikh of Fujairah to accompany him some time this month# He gave me a pledge on behalf of all of them to allow all the people connected with the British Government to travel within their territory provided he or Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali were informed in time and a guide or guard taken from them while travell ing in their territory# Muhamnt d bin Ali was then at Wushah near^ffujairah.

NS.No.140 British Agency, Sharjah Dated 9th February,1948 To, Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah. After Compliments, I have observed, with much regret, that security and order in your territory is getting worse day by day. Cases of robbery and assault by the bedouin against caravan and motor transport are allowed to pass without any action. This will naturally encourage the bedouin to indulge in more and more activities of this nature, thus rendering your territory unsafe for travelling. Within a short period the following incidents have taken place in your territory in respect of which you have taken no action at all:- (a) The assault by the Awamir on the Batini caravan which took place on the 14th January at the plain near to the entrance of Wadi el Q,aur. (b) The robbery of the car of Ubaid Ballaham which took place on the 20th January in the vicintgy of A1 IVbrra water well, by the Beni Q,itab. (c) The attack on the car of Ahmad bin Abdur Razzaq Bahrani on the 31st January, the looting of passenger’s luggage and the stripping and smashing of the car, by the Beni Qitab. 2. The neighbouring Shaikhs are highly dissatisfied at your attitude which tends to encourage the bedouin in their depredations; and some of them have complained to me. They state that most of the Beni Qitab guards employed by you are robbers and abductors and that by keeping them in your service you connive at their actions. Two of the most notorious are Rashid and Hamad as Saman who are responsible for several cases of abduction. I think that the least you can do is to dismiss both of these persons- 2 - and prevent them from coming to your town in future. 3. I also advise you to take action immediately to secure the return of the stolen articles referred to in para 1 (c) above and to compensate the owner of the car for the loss he has suffered in your Shaikhdom. 4 . Unless this subject of Bahrani is compensated, I shall be compelled to report the matter to the Hobble the Political Resident for such action as he may think fit to take. Usual Ending. Cr Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah.Translation of letter No.526 dated 30th Rabi Awwal 1367 (10.2.48) from Ruler of Sharjah to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast. /■s After Compliments. Reference your letter No. 140 dated 28.3.1367 corresponding to the 9th February 1948 on the subject of the incidents that took place in the desert regions. (a) The assault by the Awamir on a caravan at the plain near to the entrance of V/adi el Qaur. These areas are unprotected and assaults by the bedouin against one another are not an unusual thing, are not the first of their kind and I had not in the past undertaken (to prevent them)• (b) As regards the looting which was committed by the Beni Qitab on the Dubai car in the vicinity of A1 Mirra water well. You are aware that good relations exist between the Government of Dubai and the Beni Q,itab who still frequent Dubai. Y/hen the Dubai people arrested the culprit they imprisoned him and recovered the stolen articles. They can now claim from them or arrest them until the articles stolen from Ahmad bin Abdu Razzaq’s car are restored. The report you have heard that the Beni Q,itab employed by me are robbers is untrue. The Beni Qitab are not employed by me only but most of them are employed by the neighbouring rulers. Rashid as Saman is not one of my men but is a member of the Beni Qitab. I have already prevented him from coming to the town. Hamad as Saman has nothing to do with this matter; he did not leave the town to commit fcicts leading to a breach of the peace. I shall dismiss him if anything is proved against him. I do not agree to such acts and do not connive at their commission. Neither the owners of the cars nor the people of the caravans are residents of this place.
