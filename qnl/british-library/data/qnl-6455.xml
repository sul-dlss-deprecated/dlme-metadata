Having been permitted to proceed to tbe north-eastern frontier of Persia and the Tekeh Turkoman border with a view to report upon the Turkoman tribes in that quarter, I proceeded to Constantinople, and from thence via Trehizond and Erzroum through Armenia to Teheran. feheran T found gloat difficulties would arise if 1 continued my journey as an Englishman, and that I should have very little opportunity of mixing with the Turkomans and of acquiring really good information if I went 'in that character. I therefore determined to travel in the disguise of an Armenian horse dealer. I left Teheran, avowedly on my way to India, and proceeded to Isfahan, where I lived nearly two and a half months in the Armenian suburb of Isfahan called Julfa. I had been in Julfa on one of my previous visits to Persia. I here very quietly made my arrangements for visiting the Turkoman border as an Armenian horse dealer I secured a young Armenian, who could be trusted, to act as my clerk and partner and also an Armenian servant. I did not inform them where I was going, but simply engaged them to travel with me wherever I might wish. I also procured some suits of Armenian clothing. I left Isfahan on the 80th September 1880 in European dress, having given out that I was going towards Hamadan and Kurmanshah in the west of Persia. I however only marched about lj marches towards Hamadan, and on the second day turned round and went almost due east, steering by compass towards a town called Nam on the edge of the Kavir or Salt Desert. When I reached a piece of desert I changed my clothes and threw my helmet, which would have been difficult to hide, down the shaft of an underground canal. I was dressed in regular Persian dress, with black lambskin hat, just such a dress as is worn by Armenian merchants of the better class in Persia. At first I rather feared discover}’, but after a few days I got quite accustomed to my new character as an Armenian, and* was able to travel with the greatest comfort and convenience in this manner I was not suspecte d of being anything but what I represented myself to be, viz., an Armenian horse dealer from Calcutta purchasing horses for the Bombay market. I had been in in Baghdad and Mesopotamia, and knew the ways of the horse dealers who supply the Bombay markets from Turkish Arabia. The price of horses having within the last few years risen very considerably in the country about Baghdad, there was nothing extraoidinary m one of the merchants engaged in this trade trying a new field In fact, a party of Bombay horse dealers had previously visited the part of the country in which I proposed to travel. I spoke Persian to the people I met, and behaved exactly as an Armenian would have done. From my long residence in the East and travels in Turkey and Persia, I was well accustomed to Oriental manners and customs and could copy them well. Mhen 1 wanted to speak privately to either my clerk and quasi partner or servant I spoke Hindustani to them, which they both knew and which is not understood in Persia. If by any chance it was understood by some one who had visited India, there would be nothing peculiar in our speaking that lan^ua«*e as we traded with that country, and I was supposed to be of a family of Armenians who had emigrated fiom Julfa and settled in Calcutta, as so many hundreds have done. Any peculiarities of accent in speaking Persian would also be attributed to my having first learnt it in India. My servant and clerk addressed me as Agha, which is the way a person of my apparent position is addressed in Persia, and gave my name as Khwagah Ibrahim, and described me as a well-to-do horse dekler on the look out for horses to export to India. I had three good ponies, one for my own riding, one for my partner, and one for the servant, who carried on his pony a large pair of saddle bags with m} limited kit contained in them. I reduced myself to the lowest limit as regards baggage or impedimenta of any kind. The first night after assuming the Armenian dress I passed in a very dirty caravanserai in a village called Habibabad some 11 miles from Isfahan* though we travelled some 30 miles on the roundabout road by which I reached it. About 2£ miles from Habibabad a small stream of &lt;, 0 od water is passed, tnen for many miles there is nothing but salt desert, and thereVas2 no sweet water until the village of Varton is reached, 16 miles from this stream. About eight miles from Habibabad we came to some remarkable salt pans. At this spot, as water was available, it had been conducted to the beds of salt, and a highly saturated solution of salt was produced. This, after a very short exposure to the burning sun overhead, appeared in the form of a beautifully white salt, the cake formed'being about a foot in thickness. Men armed with pieces of hooped wood wxre scraping up the salt into heaps, ready to be carried off by donkeys and camels which were present for the purpose of transporting the salt to Isfahan and other parts of Persia. The quantity of salt produced is enormons, and is practically only limited by the demand. For two miles the salt pans were in full working order. I do not know why this portion of the desert was worked, as the whole surface for many miles seemed eqiially fitted for the manufacture of salt. Probably the presence of water rendered the manufacture easier at this point than elsewhere. I inquired the price of the manufactured article, and was told it varied from a penny farthing to a penny half penny for 260 lbs. These salt beds are a curious feature in the Persian landscape, and also in the geology of Persia. In comparatively rainless lands, when it does rain, the water dissolves the salts contained in the soil and brings them by capillary attraction to the surface. This action, which takes place in all arid lands, is intensified in Persia by the peculiar formation of the country. Persia has little or no drainage to the sea, and consequently few' rivers of any volume. Most of the rainfall of the country, which is at best but scanty, forms small torrents, and these run down to the lowest point they can reach and there form swamps. These sw T amps are alw r ays salt, and when exposed during the torrid heat of summer to the full blaze of the sun they dry up, leaving a thin coat of salt on the surface. This process repeated each year soon forms a thick bed of salt. I consider that all formations of rock salt, wherever found, have been formed in this manner. I believe the whole of this Kavir or Great Salt Desert of Persia was at one time the bed of a shallow inland sea or lake, similar to what the Sea of Aral is at present. After several miles of this salt desert we at last reached firm ground. This salt soil after rain is quite impassable, as it becomes so sticky that progress through it is impossible. The sun w r as intensely hot, and w r e w'ere delighted to see m the distance a “ haoj ” or covered reservoir for w T ater, and very pleased at the idea of quenching our thirst. We feared that as it rarely rains in Persia during the six summer months, and it was now the end of the dry season, the water in the haoj might have dried up. I however sent my servant down the steep steps into the tank, and he joyfully called out “ There is plenty of w'ater.” He brought some up, which was clear and cold, but, alas, it was bitter brine. Not simply salt, but essence of Glauber’s salts. We hurried off to Yarton, wdiose few T green trees we could see in the distance, some six miles off. After a very hot ride we reached Varton, w hich w r e found to be a small village with a stream of good water. This stream is brought from the neighbouring mountains by an under ground canal as is usual in Persia and Afghanistan. These canals are very curious, and are known in most parts of Persia as khanat, though in Khorasan and Afghan istan they are called “ kariz.” The people w ere at first unwilling to receive us, but, after some delay, I managed to secure a small room and a place to tie up my horses in a peasant’s house of a superior sort. Some five miles from Yarton there is a hot sulphurous spring of much local celebrity as a curative agent in cutaneous disorders, and also in rheumatic complaints. There are no houses or villages near the spring, but patients live at Varton and visit the spring daily to bathe. Shah Abbas the Great, to whom everything great or good is attributed, had built a small palace here to which he used occasionally to resort for the purpose of taking these baths. The palace is now in utter ruin. I halted at Yarton on Sunday the 3rd October, and marched the next day to a village named Feshark, distance 16 miles. We skirted the range of hills which we have had on our left hand almost ever since we left Isfahan. These hills are very peculiar in appearance. They have the jagged serrated appearance so common in this country, but besides this they are wonderfully red, staiued with ferruginous oxide. I believe that the explanation of this curious colouring to be that each grain of the clay of which the mountains are composed is coated w ith a very thin pellicle of peroxide of iron, This peculiarity of the mountains also bears out my idea that all this country w T as once the bed of an inland sea or lake, as this redness is peculiar to strata formed in ancient geological periods at the bottom of seas or lakes. About six miles from Varton an “ ab umbar,” or haoj of sweet w r ater, is passed, and at this point a road turns off to a village called Zifreh. Zifreh can be seen some four miles to the left in a break of the hills. Through this pass a road goes to Ardestan and Nathenz, a town of some importance, in ancient times a very beautiful sort of faience was4 doubtful,, and even if it was true, it would by no means prove him to be a prince of any sort. He is well known in Persia, and is a man of very doubtful veracity. Feshark is a series of scattered hamlets, having about 400 inhabitants altogether. On the 5th October I marched to Mushkinun, distance 18 miles. The country was rather barren, but very far from being a desert. Many small villages with a little cultivation round each are passed. Mushkinun is a very ruinous place of 150 inhabitants. I found very great difficulty in getting shelter. Very few of the houses were habitable. Formerly it had contained 400 inhabitants, but a very large number had perished during the years of famine eight years ago. Though I was given one of the best houses in the village, it bad no door, and the owner said, “ I sold the door for bread in the famine year.” Few people who were not present during the terrible two years of famine which Persia endured can, 1 fancy, realize the utter horror and dread of that time felt by the people. They often speak of it as “ the year of judgment.” In the richer parts of the country the traces of the famine are bemg effaced, but in this part of the country, where the soil is naturally barren and the rainfall very scanty, as it borders the desert, the marks of that time of want are painfully evident.' The next day I marched through a fairly fertile country for*this part of Persia, still there are miles and miles of utterly barren land. The people, however, make the most of every drop of water that can be obtained, searching for the springs in the mountains which to-day bordered the road on both sides, and tunnelling underground canals to carry the water to their small enclosures, where a few mulberry or willow trees are grown, and a little barley, also poppies for making opium. I had purposely left the regular Isfahan and Yazd road for the first tw’o or three days of my journey, as I did not wish to meet travellers for a few days, until I had got accustomed to my new clothes, but yesterday I returned to the regular road. I went towards Nain, a town celebrated for its pottery, both in ancient and modern times. Some of the best of the faience for which Persia was formerly famous was made in Nain, and the best of modern Persian pottery is still made in this place. I stayed the night in a very poor little village called Bullabad, about 15 miles from Nain. I wuis anxious to take the short cut across the desert from Nain to Tabbas, which I believe has never been travelled by any European, but I received so bad an account of the scarcity and saltness of the w^ater that I determined to go by Ardekan to Tabbas, as it is only a little further, and the desert is not quite so trying by that road. I also wished to avoid any town in which there was a telegraph office, as I was aware that a description of every remarkable traveller is sent to the Government at Teheran from each telegraph office, and there was a telegraph office in Nain. On the 7th October I went back to the Yazd road and marched through a place called Kudunu, from whence I got good view of Nain, to the village of Bonwiz, distance 11 miles. There are two villages of the name of Bonwiz, distinguished as Balah and Picn, viz., upper and lower. A rather curious mistake is made in the map I have, as the name of the village is written Bonwizbalah, as if it w r as part of the same name. Bonwiz is a place of some 500 inhabitants, and did not seem so distressed and poor a place as some of the villages I have passed through. I actually was able to purchase a small piece of good meat here which was a luxury. A very curious thing I observed, not only in this village, but in very many many others in various parts of Persia, is that the smallest streams, sometimes only a few inches in width, are full of fish, and often fish of a considerable size. Persians seldom eat fish, there seems to be some prejudice against eating them, and the fish are unmolested and very numerous. They swarm round the place where the underground canals are brought to the surface and the stream issues from the kariz or underground channel, and run in for refuge on the slightest alarm. Many of these fish are blind, showing that they live in these underground channels and only occasionally- come out into the light. These fish breed underground in the dark kariz which extend for so many hundreds of miles in Persia, and probably in the course of a few generations from the disuse of their eyes lose the power of vision. It w r ould be a very curious experiment to collect some of these blind fish and try whether the offspring, if bred in the light, would be produced from the spawn blind or not. Many reptiles would, I think, be found in these underground kariz, which would also be well worth study bv a person who was interested in natural history. Marched on the 8th October to Naugumbaz, distant 12 miles, through a very barren country. At Naugumbaz I found a Persian regiment with their officers on the way to Teheran, to be mstructed by the Austrian officers who are at present occupied in training the Persian troops. I did not stay at Naugumbaz, which is a poor village with a caravanseri and post horse station, but went on to Chah Nau, 13 miles further. Here there was a very fine earavanseri and a magnificant covered tank for water lately finished, but the tank; was(°7 5 empty. The only water to be procured came from a small kariz, but it was as bitter and salt nearly as the sea. Even the horses could not drink it. However, our horses &lt;;ould not well proceed any farther, so I was obliged to stay here. There is a small fort in which some irregular infantry, known as “ tof unkchis ” live. However, only two were present, the rest had gone away, as the men said, to get a drink of sweet water. No food for the horses could be procured here except beet root. There was a small garden in which cotton and beet root flourished. I was informed that the extreme saltness of the water killed everything else. These tof unkchis are kept here because parties of Buktiari robbers come up from the Shiraz district occasionally and plunder along this road. We passed rather a miserable night from thirst, as it was almost impossible to swallow the bitter salt water, and started early in the hopes of getting something better. At the end of nine miles we came to a small village and got a drink of water which tasted delicious (though it was slightly brackish) after the water we had previously taken. At this hamlet we left the Yazd road and went towards Ardekan. We left the small town of Agda, where there is a telegraph and post horse station, on our right, and marched through a much more fertile country than we had previously passed through to a pretty little village called Sarb, where we got very comfortable quarters in a pomegranate garden in the house of a priest. I halted here the next day, and marched on the 11th October to Ardekan, distance 17 miles. Ardekan is a town of 20,000 inhabitants, in a fairly fertile country, carrying on a great deal of trade w T ith Yazd, Kirman, and even with India. A large number of Geubres, known in India as Parsis, live here, and many of them have visited India. Even of the Mussulman inhabitants many have been in India. Opium, assafoetida, and a red dye root called in Persian “ rhonas,” are the chief exports. Great complaints are made by the people of the quantity of land devoted to poppy cultivation. They say all the good land is taken up for opium, and so little is left for wheat, that there is a permanent scarcity in the Yazd and Ardekan districts. Many of the people say, “ We “ do not care to grow grain, it pays us much better to grow opium for the China “ market, and to import our wheat from Khorasan,” but this must have a limit, as the people in Khorasan now grow a very large quantity of opium, and the breadth of land devoted to cereals is yearly decreasing. Poppy is far the most paying crop that is grown in Persia. The Persian opium a few years ago w r as limited in quantity, and very bad in quality, but now the quantity grow n has enormously increased, while the quality has much improved. The revenue raised by the Persian Government from opium is considerable. The Government take one chest of opium in ten, in kind, but besides this the local Governors manage to get various sums out of the cultivators of poppy, beyond what is paid for land cultivated w 7 ith cereals. Poppy cultivation is therefore encouraged by the local authorities. Ardekan is defended by walls with a ditch, and has many gates. The walls are the thinnest that I have ever seen, and w ould offer no resistance to anything more serious than a Turkoman foray or a Biluchi raid. About six miles from Ardekan there is a small towm called May bud of some 5,000 inhabitants, with a telegraph office. The road to Mash-had, for which place I am marching, passes through a very desert country between Ardekan and Tabbas, and even beyond Tabbas the country is barren up to the Turshiz district. I was informed that the distance to Tabbas was 75 farsaks, and as a farsak is usually 3.^ miles this would be over 260 miles to Tabbas, over some of the most desolate country upon the face of the earth. The distance proved to be less. I believe the road from Ardekan to Mash-had, by which I am going, has not been travelled by any European traveller in its entire length, except perhaps Christie, who some 70 years ago travelled over it in disguise. Colonel Mac- gregor went over a portion of it, and some members of Khanikoff’s mission also travelled over portions of it. I wdll mention where the road I am following, and that lollowed by Colonel Macgregor, coincide. I left Ardekan on the 12th October. Eor the first few miles there is some cultivation, but this soon ceases, and the bare desert is reached, which stretches aw T ay for hundreds of miles, with only a few small villages scattered over its surface at long intervals. The road leads over a plain until the 12th mile is reached, when for a short distance the hills approach the road, but not very nearly. At the 13th mile they open out, and the small desolate plain is reached in wdiich is situated the reservoir know n as Haoz-i-Sufid. There are three reservoirs, but only one at this season contained water. After leavim; these reservoirs the road continues over this same plain until the 22nd mile, v 7 hen the hills are entered and a wide open pass is travelled through for many miles. At the 27th mile from Ardekan there is a small spring of sweet water with a rather ruinous caravanserai. This place is known as Chasma. At 33 miles the country opens out, and at 35 miles the pretty little village 5757. B6 of Homin is reached. On the left hand there are high mountains, and on all sides there are hills at some distance. Homin is a place containing about 20 houses and 80 inhabitants. Almost all the available land is employed in growing fruit. Some barley of a very curious description is grown. It is known as bitter barley, and might well be called summer barley. It comes to maturity in the most astonishingly short time after being sown. The ordinary barley is sown in October and reaped in April, but this variety is sown in July and reaped at the end of September and commence ment of October. I was assured that from the day of sowing to the harvest was only 70 days. It would be a very good variety to introduce into Northern India, where the climate is similar to this part of Persia, as two crops of barley can be taken in one year. The bread made of this barley has a very slightly bitter taste. In all other respects it is similar to ordinary barley. A species of ibex, with very line horns, is plentiful in the hills near Homin. It is not the ibex found in the Himalayas Sibirica), but a different species. I have brought home some horns, and hope to have it identified. Wild sheep (ovis cycloceros) are also very abundant, and the common Persian antelope. No signs of “ markhor ” (capra megaceros), which are so common in Sulevmani and other ranges of mountains in Afghanistan could be found. It is curious that this fine goat does not extend to Persia, while it is so common in Afghanistan. I left Homin on the 15th October. The road follows a great ravine for many miles, and in this ravine is the only spot where there would be any difficulty for guns. The whole road from Isfahan to Mash-had is perfectly practicable for guns, and I have heard of Persian ladies driving from Yazd to Mash-had when on pilgrimage. The few spots, as in this ravine, where the road cannot be passed by a wheeled conveyance, can always be avoided by a detour. Khanina, a village through which the direct road from Yazd passes, is a few miles to the right across a range of hills. The Yazd and Ardekan roads meet in this ravine at the seventh mile from Homin. At the ninth mile there is a spring of water with a char coal burner’s house, situated in a lateral ravine. I was travelling at night over this piece of road, and though it was bright moonlight, not having a guide, I failed to find the spring. As soon as I discovered that I must have passed the spring, which is known as X)oh Knlli, I lay down and slept by the roadside and returned at dawn and found the water. After watering our horses and feeding them we pushed on. At 12 miles from Homin we left the great ravine we had been passing through, and passed over a bare barren plain. Several fine reservoirs for water were passed on the road, but all at this season dry, as there has been no rain for six months. The road travelled by Colonel Macgregor joined this road near Doh Kulli. At 29 miles from Homin the caravanserai of Rizab is reached. It is merely a caravanserai in the desert, with a small spring of slightly brackish water. Formerly there was a village near here, but it was destroyed by Biluchis many years ago, and has never been rebuilt. This is the furthest point that the Biluchis seem to have reached in their raids, and when it is considered how very far this place is from Seistan from whence the raiders came, I think it is very wonderful that they ever came so far. On the 17th October I marched to Sukand, a poor village, distant 13 miles from Rizab, over the usual desert country. Sukand means sweet water, and takes its name from the fact of its having a fine spring of fresh water. It could not supply provisions to troops, as the place does not produce enough grain to feed its own inhabitants. There is a half ruinous fort in which the inhabitants live, and a fine caravanserai which would contain many hundreds of men. The fort is in bad repair, but is quite sufficiently strong to resist attack by Biluchis. The population exists by feeding flocks of sheep in the more fertile spots in the desert, and importing food which they sell to the caravans of pilgrims on their road to the shrine of Imam Iliza at Mash-had. I found the population in a great state of excitement in consequence of a band of marauding Biluchis being in the country, somewhere betw r een this place and Tabbas. I was not aware that the Persians were in such fear of the Biluchis. I knew that the sight of a Turkoman, or almost his very name, will scare Persians from the southern provinces, like a flock of pigeons are scared by a falcon, but I did not think a band of marauding Biluchis would have created such consternation as was very apparent in this place. I had the greatest difficulty in getting a guide to the next village, Pusht-i-Badam, but after pointing out that the Biluchis were not as yet reported to be between this place and Pusht-i- Badam, I at last, by paying highly, succeeded in getting a man to accompany me. A messenger came in from the deputy governor of a small place called Robat-i-Khan, asking that all travellers might be stopped, as the road was unsafe. However, as I had secured a guide, J determined to press on. I left Sukand, or Sagand as it is usually pronounced, though the former is the correct rendering, on the 17th October. Thecountry between Sagand and Tabbas can only be described as a terrible descent. At the end of 14 miles the country slightly improves, and a little tamarisk scrub and a few other bushes are seen. Here there is a ruined village called Illahabad, plundered and burnt by the Biluchis about 25 years ago. The village is situated on some rising ground, and the fort is far stronger and better than the forts ordinarily are in this part of the country. This place is a wonderful instance of how long mud buildings last in this dry land, as the fort is in very fair repair, though it is 25 years since it has been repaired. There is a fine caravanserai, but the only water is from a deep well, and the water is very brackish. Illahabad reminds me of the more desolate parts of the frontier between India and Afghanistan, so few bushes are seen in this desert, that the few tamarisk bushes make one look upon Illahabad as a sort of oasis, though it really is a wretched enough place. In ordinary times camels and sheep are brought here to graze on the scant herbage, but just now all animals have been driven away in con sequence of the Biluchi raid. If travellers remain in the caravanserai they have to bring water from Sukand, the water in the well being not only brackish, but the well is very deep, and there is no means of drawing w r ater unless the traveller comes pro vided with apparatus. The people I have conversed with tell me that formerly Biluchi raids were very frequent, but for 25 years they have been unfrequent. There was one five or six years ago. Soon after passing Illahabad I reached a piece of kavir or salt desert. Though the whole country I am travelling over is known as the Kavir or Salt Desert, that is a misnomer. It is certainly a desert, and some parts of it could be surpassed by no desert tract in the w T orld, still it is not really kavir or salt desert. Kavir or true salt desert only occurs in patches here and there. Some of these patches are, however, of very great size, extending perhaps 100 miles in length, and from 25 to 30 miles in width. The larger pieces of kavir are all to the northward. In the southern portion the rainfall being so small the pieces of kavir are much less in extent. The kavir I am now crossing may be taken as a type of salt desert, and I will describe it, and point out what I consider is the cause of this curious formation. I believe at a former period the whole of the country I am travelling over was the bed of a shallow sea. The mountains have all the signs of strata formed in lakes or shallow seas during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic periods. When the upheaval took place which raised the bed of this ancient sea to its present level, the portion of country known as the kavir still remained considerably lower than the high plateau of Persia, and the rivers which originally fell into this sea continued to pour their waters into the lowest parts of the desert and formed marshes. The waters of all springs and rivers contain salt in minute quantities, and the rivers of Persia often are so salt as to be quite undrinkable. The salts brought down by the rivers were deposited in the marsh, and as there was no outlet the salt accumulated each year adding to the quantity of salt contained in the marsh. Every summer the marsh dried up, and the surface of the marsh when dry formed the sort of desert known to the Persians as “ kavir.” Where a comparatively large river forms the marsh, the extent of country affected is great, the area of salt marsh depending upon the volume of water brought down and the saturation of the soil. One sort of kavir looks as if the ground had been ploughed up, left for some time, and that afterwards a thin glazy coating of salt clay had been laid over it. When this coating is trodden upon, it gives way, and the horse’s hoof sinks into a powdery sort of soil, containing much salt. When riding over this sort of kavir, a continued crackling sound is heard, caused by the horses’ feet breaking through the glazy surface. At other times the whole soil looks rotten, the horses’ feet sinking deeply into it, salt showing on the surface. Sometimes a damp spot is come upon, looking as if it had sweated up from below, which I believe it has. Crossing over this salt desert on a bright moonlight night, as it was to-night, the appearance of it is very peculiar. As we had a long march in prospect, I halted in the kavir to rest the horses for a few hours. At 1 a.m. I started again, and marched over the same desolate country. On the road two small holes are passed, containing very bitter water, which only camels will drink. These water holes are permanent, being filled by percolation from a water-bearing strata, but the water is almost useless ; one of my horses drank a little. Soon after passing these small water holes, an open pass between low hills is entered. Then, after the pass, which extends for 34 miles, the road leads over a bare stony plain, and at 38 miles from Sukand the poor desolate village of Pusht-i-Badam is reached.8 CHAPTER II. Pusht-i-Badam is one of the most miserable places it has ever been my lot to visit. It contains 150 inhabitants, and nearly the whole place is in ruins. Heavy rain fell some years ago, and the place collapsed like a house of cards, and the people have never had the energy to build it up again, and have contented themselves with repairing only a small portion. There is a dirty had caravanserai, just outside which there is a spring of slightly brackish water. Inside the village, which is situated in a sort of fort, there is a spring of good water. From these two springs about a square mile of ground is irrigated and cultivated, but the place does not produce enough food even to feed its own inhabitants, and could supply nothing for an army. I found it difficult to get supplies of any sort, and the people were not particularly civil. Pusht-i-Badam is a depressing sort of place altogether, and when one thinks of the great extent of miserable country to be passed over before one gets out of this desert, one’s thoughts are not particularly cheerful. The horse I was riding to-day fell with me about three miles from the village from sheer fatigue, though I had made two short halts and fed the horses twice between Sukund and Pusht-i-Badam, but 38 miles is a very long march for horses carrying heavy saddle hags, besides their riders. Also, the want of water on the road is very trying to the horses in this hot weather. The road I am travelling and that passed over by Colonel Macgregor have coincided for the last marches. From this point they separate, as Colonel Macgregor went off the road from here to visit some villages in the desert to the westward, called Beabannak. The people were in a very excited state about Biluchis declaring that it was impossible to travel just now, as the Biluchis were between Pusht-i-Badam and Robat-i-Khan, the next stage. I had very great difficulty in persuading any one to accompany me as guide, but after a great deal of trouble a man was found who consented to go, on being paid about three times as much- as he usually would have received. I would have gone on without a guide, only I required a donkey or pony to carry a pair of saddle bags, as one of my horses had a bad sore hack, and I had to have him led without a load. At last a guide and two donkeys were procured, and I left on the afternoon of the 20th for Robat-i-Khan. This is the worst march on the whole road; the desert is more terrible and trying both to man and beast, and the march longer before any human habitation is reached. This part of the country may be considered the dividing line between the Dasht-i-Kavir, or Great Salt Desert, and the Dasht-i-Lut, or desert which extends far away to the great Seistan swamp, if the spot where two deserts meet can be called a dividing line. After leaving Pusht-i-Badam, the road leads over the usual barren plain for 4^ miles, when a poor little hamlet of four houses and a tower is reached. Here there is a small spring of brackish water, and a little patch of cultivation, but the people trust more to feeding a few goats and sheep on the edge of their cultivation on some tamarisk scrub than on what they can raise from their fields. At 18 miles a tower with a fine reservoir for water, but which is now empty, is reached. It is built on a small ridge of firm ground, the country before arrriving at it and after passing it being very sandy. Ibis ridge is the dividing line between Khorasan, the ancient Parthia, and the government of Yazd. Pusht-i-Badam is in the government of Yazd. My guide was in great terror of the Biluchis, and declared that this was just one of the places they were likely to be hiding, to pounce upon unwary travellers. I went a few hundred yards off the road, and rested the horses for three hours in a small ravine, and started again about midnight. The moonlight was almost as bright as day, and we pushed on. I, and one servant, want on ahead w hile the guide and the other servant followed with the two donkeys, who delayed us a good deal. Soon after passing Haoz-i-Shah Abbas w r e came to some of the worst sand dunes that I have ever seen. The road leads up one sand lull and down another, each so like the other that it was very difficult to keep the track. The guide had been left far behind, and w r e toiled on for several miles, our horses sinking almost to their knees in the sand. At 24 miles the road ascends a low rocky ridge of hills, and the relief of getting upon firm ground once more was very great. This piece of sandy desert is the only impediment to guns or wdieeled conveyance over the whole of this desert country. The sand can, however, be avoided by a considerable detour. At 32 miles the road descends into a plain, and at the foot of the descent is a tiny spring of good w-ater. I had been especially warned about this place at Pusht-i-Badam. It was said that this little spring in thett)^ 9 desert, which is known as Chasma Shuturan, or the camel’s spring, was a favourite lurking place for marauding Beluchis, and that the hand at present raiding was sup posed to be in the neighbourhood of this spring. I therefore only watered my horses, filled my leather water bottle with water, and went on about half a mile, then turned off the road, and rested the horses and donkeys for two hours and fed them. The place I chose for this rest was a splendid place for hiding in, as it commanded a view of the road, and we could not be seen. I would have preferred pushing on, but the heavy sand had tried the horses’ strength So much that we were obliged to halt. Near the spring of Chasma Shuturan there is a tower and the ruins of an old fort. After passing this place the road continued over a plain, with occasional patches of heavy sand, for three miles, and then there was an open sort of pass with low hills for two miles. At 39 miles from Sukand the small village of Robat i-Khan is reached. Here there is a fine caravanserai and a tower. The water from the spring, which gives a good supply, is rather brackish, There is a fine covered reservoir, from which good 1 water can be drawn, a little way from the caravanserai. At this place the alarm of the people about Biluchis was intense, and I received the first authentic news about them. Robat-i-Khan is the first village in Khorasan, and is under the Khan of Tabbas. He has placed here a sort of petty governor to look after the road, who has an escort of half a dozen sowars. The man himself is not uncivil, but the people are very boorish and uncivil. One of my servants was beaten by some of the people, and, though great apologies were made, I could get no real redress or punishment of the offender. This was the only place, except Tabbas, where I found the people inclined to be uncivil, because we w r ere Armenians. I here met two men and two women who had been in the bands of the Biluchis, of whom I had been hearing so much. The men declared that they, with their wives and two other men, were on their w r ay from Kirman to Tabbas, when they were captured by Biluchis, some 80 miles to the southward of this place. They said they were suddenly attacked by Biluchi plunderers, stripped of everything they possessed, and one of the party who gave offence to the Biluchis, by refusing to act as their guide, was hacked to pieces with swords in their presence. Another traveller, not of their party, was also murdered by the Biluchis, while they were with them, and they heard that a third had been killed before their capture. The Biluchis carried them about upon camels for three days, and at last released them in the desert, not very far from Chasma Shuturan. They said the Biluchis were a party of 37 armed men, nearly all mounted on swift riding camels, trained to go at a great speed. These Seistan camels are celebrated all over the East for their speed and endurance. They can travel 70, or even 80, miles a day for many days together. I have myself knowm a camel, with a man and light load, cover 92 measured miles of ground in one day, but this pace could not have been kept up. With these trained camels, which only require water every other day, and which, on a pinch, can go three days without water, the Biluchis can scour the country for incredible distances, lying hidden in some ravine, and pouncing upon unwary travellers, driving off sheep and camels. They feed their camels on balls of barley meal, mixed up with a little water into a paste, and can find enough grazing here and there in the desert for their hardy camels. They only visit some lonely spring every other day, water their camels, fill their skin with water bags, and then retire again into some unknown spot in the desert. Biluchis are not so much dreaded as Turkomans, as they do not ordinarily kill their victims, if the victims are submis sive, w hile the Turkomans always carry off, or kill, every one who falls into their hands. Biluchis are ordinarily content with stripping and plundering travellers. The petty governor of Robat-i-Khan, who came to see me, said that, besides the band of 37 Biluchis who were plundering near here, and wriio carried off a large flock of sheep from Chasma Shuturan only the day before I passed that place, there w^as a large band of several hundred Biluchis plundering the country to the northward of Tabbas, between that place and Bajistan on the Mash-had road. 1 was most anxious to get on, but I could get no guide, and could hire no animals of any sort to replace my horse, who was laid up. I was detained here sorely against my will for three days. The caravanserai, which was a large clean one, w as crowded with caravans of pilgrims on the way to Mash-had. One large caravan attempted to leave, but was stopped by the Deputy Governor, who declared he had received orders from Tabbas to stop all caravans. One day a man w r ho had been out near Chasma Shuturan, gathering assafoetida on the hills, came running in to the village, and reported that he had, from the hill above Chasma Shuturan, seen a large party of Biluchis come to the spring, water their camels, fill their water skins, and then go away. I here met a very civil camel man named Aly Kuli Beg, of Kain, near the Seistan border. He was on 5757. C10 his way to Birjand, with a caravan of merchandise from Yazd. I made a good deal of acquaintance with this man, who was a very superior sort of person, and I believe a bra\rer man than most Persians. He determined to go- on in spite of the Eiluchis, and I hired a camel from him for the carriage of my saddle bags. He told me he would not be mixed up with pilgrims, as they were such a helpless set of people. He kept the hour and route by which he was going secret. He muffled the bells of his camels, and, as soon as it was quite dark, he set off. Carefully concealing from the villagers the road he intended to take, he started off across country. In fact he so concealed his movements that I was almost left behind. He started about one and a half hours before the time he had told me he would, so that I had to hurry my depar ture. I very nearly missed the road in the dark, as he started a little before me, but Aly Kuli Beg had left a man on the road to show me which way he had gone. The night was very dark, and strict silence was preserved. There were about 50 camels, but the padded feet of the camels made no sound. After a weary march of hours we reached a small village called Jafliru or Jaffirabad. We had travelled over a very rough and desert country, crossing a pass which was very trying to the camels, known as Tung-i-I)n. Jaffirabad contains some 60 inhabitants; it is a fairly fertile village. The men go about armed, which is unusual in Persia. A fine looking man gave me a description of an attack by Biluchis on this village 20 years ago, when the place was plundered and burnt, and he himself carried off captive to Seistan, and only released on payment of a ransom of 25 tomans. The Biluchis attacked a strong tower which was shown to me in ruins, piled brushwood, against the wooden door and burnt it and then rushed in, capturing the garrison. They have now a fine new tower, and in the evening eight of the men paraded and marched off to garrison the tower. As they were all dressed alike and were fine men they had a very soldier-like appearance. They told me they did this every night whether Biluchis were in the neighbourhood or not; they said they were very much exposed to raids, and that three years ago, when all the men happened to be out of the village looking after their sheep, the place was plundered by Biluchis. They spoke most disparagingly of the Khan of Tabbas, saying, he was a woman and no man, and that though he drew an allowance from the Shah for the purpose of keeping up 500 cavalry, he pocketed the money and allowed his subjects to be plundered. The marauding Biluchis were reported to have taken up their position at some water near Kalpiarz, on the direct road some 13 miles from Jaffirabad, and might have a party out to watch for caravans on this road also. As soon as it was dark we started again with the same precautions as the night before, and had another weary night march. We were informed that the Khan of Tabbas had sent out a party of sowars to garrison a place called Shurab Ahmad Sultan through which we should pass ; this place is some 12 miles from Jaffirabad. When we reached Shurab, however, we found that there were no sowars there, and that even the two men who ordinarily live in a tower to sell provisions to travellers had fled from fear of Biluchis. After a march of 14 hours, though the distance is only miles, we reached a small cluster of villages known as Char Deh or the four villages. The names of the villages are Jowcar, Targhinun, Tushkanun, and Madiabad. Jowcar is the largest, and the four villages contain an aggregate of 800 inhabitants. It is very pleasant to get here and again taste water that is not salt. In any other country this place would be considered a very undesirable place of residence, but here it is looked upon as a sort of terrestrial paradise. The whole country is composed of sand, but there being a fair supply of good water, with which the sand is irrigated, dates are produced in great abundance, and a few other trees can also be grown. The date palm is not a handsome tree, but a clump of date palms does at all events look green, and after the many desert tracts I have lately passed over, anything green is very pleasant to the eye. A few mulberry trees and pomegranates are to be seen. Tobacco and grain are grown inr small quantities, and dates in very large quantities indeed, and exported to all parts of Persia. Tabbas, the chief town of this district, and the seat of the Governor, is about 10 miles from here. There are two caravan roads from here to Mash-had, ordinarily used by pil grims; one via Bajistan, and the other via Nishapur. Neither pass through Tabbas, which is left 10 miles off by either road. I have, however, determined to travel by neither of these roads, but to go by Turshiz and Turbat-Hidari, which is a route very little known. In fact, I believe the road from Chardeh to Turshiz has never been travelled by any Englishman. I halted two days in Chardeh to purchase a mule to replace the horse which was knocked up, I had been so troubled by the difficulty of hiring animals. On the third day I rode into Tabbas, as I11 no wanted to see that place. Sir John Malcolm has thrown a sort of halo round Tabhas by his account of the Khan and place, hut I found it rather an ordinary Persian town in appearance. Sir John Malcolm never visited the place himself. The Governor, who is of an Arab family from the shores of the Persian Gulf, is noted for his stupidity and bigotry all over Khorasan, and many amusing stories are told of his mistakes, and of the bulls that he makes. The Government is always called in Persia Tun and Tabhas, from the two largest towns in it. Tabbas is, however, much the most important place, and the residence of the Governor. The Governor is named Mirza Mahomed Bakhir Khan, and he has the title of Imad-ul-Mulk or Pillar of the State, from the Shah; he is himself at present away at Mashad, and the place is ruled by his son during his absence. The government of Tabbas is hereditary in the same family, and has been so for many generations. The Governor, though appointed by the Shah, is always chosen from this particular family. There is no Persian garrison in Tabbas or in all the territories of the Khan of Tabbas. The Khan or Governor pays a fixed sum to the Shah, and as long as that is paid he is left very much to do as he pleases. The Khan has no army or guns, and the population is excused all military service as being very unwarlike. No conscripts are furnished by the Tabbas district to the regular Persian army. Tabbas reminds me certainly more of Arabia than Persia. I suppose it is the sandy soil and date palms which cause the resemblance. The only Englishman who has visited Tabbas besides myself is Colonel Macgregor, who was here in 1875, and a portion of whose road here corresponded with mine. Erom Tabbas he went towards Birjand and Herat. The tobacco grown in Tabbas is very celebrated in Persia, and 3,000 camel loads are exported each year, chiefly to Teheran and Mash-had. It is considered inferior to the tobacco of Shiraz, but superior to all other Persian tobacco. I myself prefer the Tabbas tobacco to the Shiraz. It is of the same flavour, but milder. A little silk and opium are also imported, but, after tobacco, the chief export is assafoetida and dates. Assafcetida is produced in very large quantities on the borders of the desert, and sent to India. The Persians cannot imagine of what use the stinking gum known as assafoetida can be, and asked what w r as done with it in India. I told them it was used in medicine, and also that a very small quantity was put into certain sorts of food as flavouring. I was asked if I had ever tasted food so prepared, and on my replying that I had, and that I thought it rather good, I was looked upon with horror. Assafoetida is the produce of a plant which growls in the most arid tracts. The plant is cut down, and a sticky very evil-smelling gum exudes, which forms small lumps on the cut stems. This is carefully collected, and the stems cut again and again, so as to cause more gum to exude. A fine plant will bear cutting fourteen times in the season, which lasts about eight months from spring until autumn. Tabbas has a fortified portion, which is surrounded by a wall of sun-burnt brick with many towers. There is a narrow r but very deep ditch, and twm gates, stronger and altogether better constructed than is usual in Persia. Inside this fortified portion is situated the ark or citadel, the walls of which are in very bad repair. In this resides the eldest son of the Khan. A large portion of the town is situated without the walls. The people are a very peaceable set, and, when not troubled by Biluchi raids, the government entails no trouble, and nothing is done beyond the collection of the revenue. That portion of the duties of Government is carefully attended to at all times in Persia. First, the sum necessary to be paid to the Central Government, then a good sum for the Khan himself. There is rather a fine covered bazaar in the city, but most of the shops are unoccupied. There is a large mosque, with one of the tallest and largest minarets I have ever seen, but this fine minaret is fast going to ruin. The fortified portion of the town contains 1,000 houses, which would give a population of between 5,000 and 6,000 inhabitants. Outside the fortifications the town extends for about a mile. There is an open street, with trees extending for about a mile from the town gate, which has a fine appearance. The Khan’s hall of audience was described to me as a splendid building, but I did not visit it, knowing well what such places are, and considering that what was wonderful in the eyes of the inhabitants of this desert land would probably appear nothing extraordinary to me. The people were a boorish uncivilized set. Many of them were fairer than I should have expected them to be. Very few wore the Persian lambskin hat; most people wore turbans, the peculiar Yazd pattern of turban being the commonest. They were just such a people as one would expect to find in such a place, shut in as they are from all civilizing influences in their desert-girt home. Even the following of Teheran men which a Persian Governor usually brings with him is here wanting, as the Governor never goes to Teheran, and the same stupid family succeeds one another in the government. Even ‘the small amount of polish brought by having a garrison of officers and soldiers wh*&gt;12 have been drilled by foreign officers is here wanting, as Tabbas has no garrison. On all sides this country is more or less surrounded by deserts. The only direction in which the place is approachable is from the north-east, where Mash-had lies, and the very small amount of civilization the place possesses filters through from Mash-had, not itself a place of much culture. There was a good caravanserai in the town, but the man in charge would not permit of our putting up there, as he believed us to be Armenians. I could no doubt have found another place to put up in, but I did not care to stay in the town. On entering the place I was afraid that I might be recognized as a European, but these people never suspected me, and fully believed me to be an Armenian, and in consequence were not civil. I purchased a mule here, to replace one of my horses, and I rode back to Jowcar, one of the Chardeh group of villages where I was staying. This not permitting Christians even to stay in their caravanserai is a sample of the bigotry of the inhabitants. Except in Iliad, in Central Arabia, I should doubt there being any town in Asia where European influence or any influence tending towards enlightenment was so little felt as in 1 abbas, the number of the population I could not ascertain with any degree of correctness, the number mentioned to me being so much in excess ot what was pro liable. The place flourishes in a dead-alive sort of way, and is a specimen of what a town becomes when under Mahomedan bigotry untempered by any outside influence. Some members of Khanikoff’s Russian mission visited Tabbas, as they- did most towns in Khorasan. Colonel Macgregor and I are the only Englishmen who have been here. He gives a most unfavourable account of it, and I entirely endorse his statement. The country between Tabbas and Yazd or Ispahan which I have lately passed over is utterly impracticable for the passage of an army, as there would not be sufficient water*at the different stages to supply even a very small body of men with this necessary. ..... I left Chardeh on the 30th October, the road leads over the usual sandy plain haying a high range of mountains on the right hand known as the Shutari mountains. They were about nine miles distant, and the highest peaks are probably 10,000 feet in height. I am told that even in summer snow is found in the clefts on the highest peaks. On the left the Nastandgi range were about 14 miles distant. The Nastandgi range are not so lofty as the Shutari range, probably the highest peaks are not more than 8,000 feet‘in height. A third range of mountains was in sight, named the Shorab range, but these mountains were lower than the others. At the fifth mile a village is passed called Deh Shorab. The Shutari and Nastandgi ranges of mountains approach one another, the road keeping near the former range. At 16 miles the road turns more to the eastward, and at 18 miles passes through a gorge in the Shutari chain of mountains. Here a road goes off to X)eh Mahomed and Eajistan, but as I wished to visit Sultanabad in the TUrshiz district, I left the Deh Mahomed road and went to a village called Shirkisht. It is a very small place, with a large tower, and three or four houses for travellers. Only two families inhabit this place, and support themselves by selling provisions to travellers. The tank, which is filled by a small spring, is full of leeches, and this was also the case at Ilobat-i-Khan. My horses are suffering much from these leeches. They get into the throat and nostrils of the horses, and cause great annoyance and loss of blood to the animals. Sometimes a leech fixes itself so firmly in the nostril, and in so out of the way a position, that it cannot be removed for several days. This occurred to one of my horses. On the road from Chardeh to-day I was pointed out a whitish spot on the hills know r n as Nastandgi, and was told that the village of Nastandgi, from which this range takes its name, was situated just below that spot, though the village cannot be seen from the road. It is most difficult to find out the names of ranges of mountains in Persia. The real fact is, they do not generally have names for ranges of mountains, but only for the more prominent peaks. From Shirkisht the road runs about 30 east of north, skirting the Shutari range of hills for some seven miles. This range here ends, but a spur is thrown out, which is virtually a continuation of the range. At the end of the 14 miles the poor village of Pashna Dorun is reached, situated in a small mud fort. There are three other small villages near it, knowm as Nasratabad, Futtehabad, and Mahomedabad. The four villages only contain about ,100 inhabitants. These villages, though small, are fairly fertile. Very good tobacco is grow r n here. On the 2nd November I went on over the same desolate plain, the mountains on the right approaching the road more nearly. At eight miles the towm of Dasjirdun is passed on the left, but it is far off the road. There are roads which cross the desert to Sam nan and Damghan from Dasjirdun. The camels which carry the tobacco of Tabbas to Teheran go by this road. A man who had travelled the road told me it was 10 days’ journey to Damghan. r l hat there was water at each stage varying from 20 to 24 miles apart, and that at eight marches iromDasjirdun and two from Damghan a village called Tuhrute is passed. He said the road was an easy one for camels and much used for camel caravans. Horsemen never used this road as no food for horses can be procured on it. He said that ordinarily there were no inhabitants along the road, but that camps of wandering Iliats of Biluch descent sometimes pitched their camps near the springs in the winter season. No kavir or salt desert was crossed by this road, though some was skirted. My informant had not travelled by the road from Khur to Damghan, but he had heard there was much kavir on that road. This confirmed what I had been told in Tabbas that the road from Khur to Damghan was very trying, and that much kavir or salt desert had to be crossed on that road, and that there was one space of 70 miles without water to be passed. In the spring there is water at one or two spots, but it only lasts a short time after the winter rains cease. The road usually taken by the inhabitants of Tabbas and all this part of the country when they wish to visit Teheran or other parts of Western Persia is via Sabazawar. This road, though longer, has little or no kavir on it. I now return to a description of the road I am at present travelling. After passing Dasjirdun, which is some miles to the left of the road, the track continues over the same plain country until the fourteenth mile is reached. Here there is a flourishing village of about 250 inhabitants called Deh Nobun. Supplies could be procured at this village in small quantities, and a large quantity of supplies could be drawn from Das jirdun and its villages, as they are rich for this part of the country and numerous. Dasjirdun is the head-quarters of a petty governor appointed from Tabbas. The hills to the right of the road are a spur from the Shuturi range, and are here called Kuh Nobun, Irom the village of Nobun. I passed the night in a small hamlet called Abid, a little to the left of the road. It is a poor place, and the water is bad and salt. It is 21 miles from Pushna Darun, from whence I started to-day. On the 3rd November I had a long and trying march of 30 miles through a very barren country to Zungi Chah. There is no water the whole way, though water can be found at a well known as Chah Sherin, if a considerable detour is made, but I did not visit the well. Zungi Chah has a fine caravanserai and a very poor village, where provisions of the most necessary kind are obtained with difficulty. I here came upon the largest expanse of kavir I have hitherto met with. It extends for some 25 miles, I am told, in breadth, and for more than a hundred in length, but its limits are unknown exactly to the people here. The population of this place sup ports itself chiefly by the collection of assafoetida, which grows very plentifully in the neighbouring hills. Assafcetida only seems to flourish in very desolate places. In fact, where nothing else grows there, the plant which produces assafoetida may generally be found, and enables a poor population to obtain a livelihood by its collection. The road after leaving Zungi Chah turns away from the kavir, and enters a low range of hills, which are a continuation of the range known as Yakuh. At about 14 miles there is a well of bad stinking water, known as Kubogish. Twenty camels had almost drank the well dry. Perhaps, wdien there is more water in it, the smell and taste may not be so offensive as when I visited it. The water was strongly impregnated with sulphur, and the odour was very disagreeable indeed. At the end of 20 miles I lay down for a few hours, and rested the horses during a part of the night. At the earliest sign of dawn we resumed our march. The whole country was much alarmed by the raids of the Biluchis, a party of some 200 of whom were plundering in this neighbourhood. A few days previously they had captured a very large caravan of 200 camels, said to be laden with goods to the value of 12,000 tomans, or about 4,400/., at a place about 20 miles to the eastward of Zungi Chah. I had no guide with me, only my servants, who were much alarmed at the reports we heard. A few days later we met a number of people of the plundered caravan. They said the Biluchis had carried off everything, even searehing the women for concealed valuables, and stripping them of all but the most necessary clothing. No harm was done beyond this, and no lives were taken. The 200 camels with their loads were carried off. The alarm is very serious, and it is very discreditable to the Khan of Tabbas that these marauders are thus permitted to plunder the country. When at Mash-had, I subsequently heard an account of the cause of these Beluchi raids from one who was behind the scenes, and I will here mention wdiat I then learnt. The Amir of Kain, a Persian Governor of much impor tance, formerly had Seistan added to his Government. A few years ago the Shah took Seistan away from him, and appointed a Kajar, one of the Shah’s own tribe, to be Governor of that province. The Amir of Kain was also deprived of some of his own villages, which were made over to the Khan of Tabbas. This enraged him much, and he incited some of his old subjects, the Biluchis of Seistan, to plunder the territory of the Khan of Tabbas, giving them a free passage through his own territory. Subset14 quently, when found fault with by the Central Government, he seized and restored the 200 camels carried off, but not the property with which they were laden. After this, another party of Biluchis, having heard of the great success of the former bands in plundering, attempted to emulate their deeds, but without first coming to an under standing with the Amir of Kain. These were almost all killed. When I stayed to rest my horses, I was warned by a passing caravan of the danger of halting where I did, but I went a little way off the road, and lit no fire, so as not to attract attention. At 30 miles from Zungi Chah I reached the first village in the Turshiz district, called Allahabad, and, at 34 miles, Abdullabad. The whole of this Turshiz plain is very fertile. Everywhere bushes grow naturally, and there is good natural grazing for camels, which are found in very great numbers in this district. The Aim antelope I also saw in great numbers. Wherever water is brought great crops of grain are produced, and all sorts of fruit and vegetables are plentiful and good. The Turshiz district is celebrated for its grapes. I halted one day at Abdullabad. It occupies a portion of the site of a city called Eerozebad, which is said to have been destroyed by Tamerlane, or the Amir Timour, as he is always called in Persia. There are some remains of fine brick minars of ancient mosques still standing, and the situation of the ancient gateways, many miles apart, can still he traced. In the village of Abdullabad is an ancient Zoroastrian fire temple, built of small bricks. It is now used as a mosque, but it is evidently a fire temple, and is not suited to its present use, as it is not turned towards Mecca. The people all acknowledge that it was a fire temple, and has only com paratively lately been transformed into a mosque. There are not so many ruins here as I should have expected. Persian cities, being built of sunburnt brick, leave very little trace behind after a few hundred years. One of the brick minarets to be seen about two miles from Abdullabad has apparently been covered with encaustic tiles, pieces of such tiles being scattered about near it. It is a great pleasure to get into a fairly fertile land again after all the desert and barren country I have been passing through for so many weeks. Cows and oxen are seen in the fields, and ploughing is done by oxen, not by hand, as in the poorer country to the southward, where camels and goats, sheep and donkeys, are the only animals to be seen. On the 8th November I marched over a fertile plain, with mountains on all sides, to the prosperous village of Khalilabad, distance 22 miles. On the road the village of Kundur is passed. Kundur has two good canals of water, each running in a full stream about six feet wide. These streams are brought from the Shishdraz river. The Shishdraz, which is marked in maps as passing Kundur, certainly does not do so as a large stream, only these two small streams from it reach that place. It is called Shishdraz because it is divided into six streams or channels, and two of these reach Kundur. Khalilabad, where I stayed the night, has been a very strong place. There is a fine old fort, much stronger than is usual in this part of the world, hut it is fast falling into ruin. The many years of peace which Persia has enjoyed during the reign of Nasur-ud-Din Shah has made the people careless of repairing their forts, and they now prefer to live outside. The mountains surrounding this Turshiz plain are known as Kuh Bejwird and Siah Kuh to the northward, and as Kuh Begou to the south. On the 9th November I reached Sultanabad, the chief town of the Turshiz dis trict. It is a clean, well-built town, strongly fortified, but the walls and ditches have fallen into a state of utter disrepair.* Sultanabad is a place of some 6,000 in habitants, surrounded by many flourishing villages. A very large quantity of silk is here produced, which is exported to Constantinople, and the countries bordering the Caspian and Black Seas. Very little if any silk is sent to Western Europe, the price of silk being actually higher in Persia than it is in Lyons and Marseilles, the European seats of the silk trade. Silk waste is very cheap in the Turshiz district, and this can be exported at a good profit. The Persians are unable to make any use of the silk waste, which is therefore of little or no value to them. In Lyons, I am assured by one engaged in the Persian silk trade, goods as high in price as 32s. a yard are manufactured from silk waste and refuse silk. In Khalilabad I visited a silk reeling factory, and made inquiries as to the prices of the raw silk, cocoons, and eggs. In the Turshiz district more money is made by the export of silk worms’ eggs than by any other product. No disease has ever appeared among the worms in Turshiz, and the worm is celebrated as resisting disease better than any other, even when hatched elsewhere. In consequence the eggs are in much request, and fetch an exceptionally high price, being worth 18 tomans, or * Though on all maps a town called Turshiz is marked, there is no such town. Turshiz is only the name of the district.15 6/. 13$., a mund of 13 lbs. The cocoons are worth from 1/. 10$. to 11. 12$. a shah mund of 13 lbs. The silk that is broken in reeling is sold for 8$. a mund of 13 lbs. This seemed wonderfully cheap to me, but this waste silk can only be procured in small quantities. The actual case of the cocoon, after all the silk has been reeled off, is also exported. While in the Turshiz district I made a good deal of inquiry into the way that soldiers are recruited for the Persian army. One regiment is furnished by Turshiz and one by Turbat Hidari, the neighbouring district. In each of these districts I stayed in the house of a naib or lieutenant of one of these regiments. The con scription falls very unequally upon the population of Persia. 'Many districts do not furnish any soldiers at all, the population being considered too unwarlike to furnish efficient soldiers. For instance, the towns of Kashan, Isfahan, and Yazd furnish no soldiers whatever, though a sum of money is paid by those towns for the privilege of being exempted. The Turk tribes o*f Azarbijan furnish a very large proportion of the soldiers of the Persian army, the Iliats, or nomad tribes, also, whether of Persian or Turk descent, have to supply an undue proportion of soldiers, as these nomad tribes make far more efficient soldiers than the inhabitants of cities. There is no rule by which the men are conscripted. The Shah orders a certain dis trict to furnish a regiment of one thousand men, and appoints a Colonel known as Sartip, or a Lieutenant-Colonel known as Sarhang, to command the regiment. The regiment consist of 10 companies, each company consisting of a Sultan or Captain, and 2 Naibs or Lieutenants, and one hundred men. Besides this each regiment has two or three Yavirs or Majors. The battalions are never complete, 800 men being the utmost number that are ever produced, and I believe often even 600 men are the total of effectives, though pay is always drawn for 1,000 men. The Colonel appointed by the Shah visits the district apportioned to him for the raising of his regiment, and roughly apportions to each village the quota of recruits to be furnished. A very few come forward and enlist voluntarily, but the great majority have to be pressed into the service. The Colonel visits the village with a party of soldiers, and takes the men he requires, willing or unwilling. Those who wish to escape pay him a handsome sum to escape the conscription. Those who cannot pay have to serve for life. In some cases the villagers collect a sum of money, and pay the men who go a certain sum. Also some money is occasionally paid by the Colonel as enlistment money. The sum paid varies. One individual soldier I spoke to told me the sum he had received was five tomans, something under two pounds. He said, “I was not willing to enlist, but as I had to go, whether I took the money or “ not, I took it. 5 ’ For this sum he had become a soldier for life, or until extreme old age prevented his serving. No pay is paid to them while in their villages, but they are furnished with 325 lbs. of wdieat each annually. This is less than a pound of wheat a day. When serving in districts far from their own homes they are supposed to receive enough wheat to make 3| lbs. of bread daily, and seven tomans, or about 2,1. 12$., in money yearly, but neither the money nor the wheat reach the soldier except in a very diminished quantity. My informant told me had been aw r ay garrisoning Sarakbs and Daragez against the Turkomans, and in two years, a portion of which • had been spent On active service, he had received 10 tomans, or about Zl. 15$. Also when on the march from one place to another no food is supplied, and the soldiers are obliged to plunder to feed themselves, no rations being supplied until their destination is reached. No uniform is supplied, the men furnishing their owm, except once in two years a thin blue cotton coat, worth about 2$., is furnished to them. My in formant w'as dressed in a very neat uniform, but he had provided it himself. He 'told me that he was a small landowmer, and that during the tw r o years he had been away from his home that he had spent 30 tomans, or about 11/. 2$., out of his own pocket to supply himself with food and necessaries. In Sultanabad I met the first Russian trader whom I came across. He was a Russian Mohomadan from the Government of Tiflis, and purchasing corn in large quantities. The next day I made a short march of five miles to Furk, the last village in the Turshiz district. On the 11th November I marched 23 miles, to Kushdureh. The road leads over a barren stony plain for 14 miles, a few poor villages being seen. At the fourteenth mile the flourishing village of Azghan is passed. Azghan is situated about 1^ miles to the left of the road. At 18 miles from Furk I crossed a stream with a rapid current running in a very deep bed. This is the first stream of any size which I have crossed since leaving Isfahan. The stream is about 50 feet wide, running with a strong current over a pebbly bottom, and from the depth to which it had eroded its bed and the width of the ravine, it must in spring time bring down a large volume of water. The course, as far as it can be seen, is nearly due north and south. It is saidto rise in the Derby mountains, near the Kuh Surkh range, but not from them. It passes through the Siah Kuh range, and runs towards Faizabad, where it is used up in irrigation, but probably its surplus water runs into and forms the kavir, seen near Zungi Chah. I believe also that the surplus water of the Shishdraz stream which is not used up in irrigation runs into this kavir. The Kuh Surkh must be a high range of mountains, as it produces these considerable streams, which, even at this dry season, still contain plenty of water. I am sorry I cannot get a view of the Kuh Surkh hills. The part of the country between this place and Nishabur has not been surveyed, and is a blank on all maps. This stream is known as the Azghan Rud, and there is said to be a very fine waterfall, where it passes through the Siah Kuh range, not many miles from this. Just over the stream is a large fort in ruins, which was destroyed by an earthquake seven years ago, when many of the inhabitants perished. At Furk also, where I slept last night, the fort was in ruins, and I was told it was destroyed by an earthquake seven years ago, and that twenty-two of the inhabitants were killed. At twenty-three miles from Furk the fort of Kushdurreh is reached ; it contains about eighty inhabitants, and the fort is in better repair than usual. Mulberry trees are grown in great numbers, and about seventy-five munds of 13 lbs. each ot silk uocoons are produced yearly. It furnishes seven soldiers to the Turbat Hidari regi ment. I was very civilly received and put up by a Naib, or Lieutenant, of that regiment, named Aly-Jan-Beg. He had only three days previously returned from service in Seistan, where he had been quartered at a place called Hussainabad, the new capital of Persian Seistan. He told me that his regiment had lost many men, chiefly from sickness, while quartered in Seistan. In the early morning, towards the eastward, I saw a high range of mountains; they were called Kuh Kakht, and are said to be seventy-five miles distant. I marched from Kushdureh to Turbat Hidari, distance 18 miles. At 14 miles the road leaves the plain near a village called Buriabad, and passes through some low hills to Turbat Hidari. CHAPTER III. Journey from Turbat Hidari to Daragez. Turbat Hidari is a place of some importance, the seat of a Persian Governor, a prince of the Kajar family, named Shazada Mohomad Mirza. A good deal of trade is carried on in silk and wool with Sabzawar, and in indigo with Kandahar. I here met a Panjab Hindoo, who had come from Bokhara via Maimana, Herat, and Khaf. He had been away from the Panjab eleven years, the greater part of the time in Bokhara. He told me that at Khaf, which is three da) s’journey trom Turbat Hidari, on the Herat frontier, twenty Hindoo traders are settled. He was himself on his way to Kirman, where there are many Hindoo traders. He was a native of Amiitsur, in the Panjab. The silk of the Turbat Hidari district is particularly good and white ; it fetches a higher price than that realized by any other Persian silk. The quantity exported from Turbat Hidari is great. Both in this and the Turshiz district the produce of a fairly flourishing village is about 75 munds of 13 lbs. each of silk cocoons, many villages furnishing much more. Yesterday, at Kushdurreh, my host, Aly-Jan-Beg, of the Tuibat Hidari regiment, gave me a graphic description of the taking of the small fort at that place, 30 years ago, by the Turkomans. They burnt down the door of the fort by piling brushwood against it, and captured the place, which seems to have made little or no resistance, only two Turkomans having been killed. The narrator, then a lad, was carried off with his mother prisoners to Merv. His father was killed in resisting the attack on the fort. Turkomans never raid in this part of the country now. Aly-Jan-Beg and his mother were only released on payment of 300 tomans ransom, or about 111/. At present the ransom ordinarily paid to Turkomans for the release of prisoners is much less, slaves having fallen in value, the markets for slaves in Khiva and Bokhara having been practically closed hy the Russians. Some slaves are still sold in Bukhara, but not openly. The trade in slaves in Khiva has been .entirely suppressed. Thousands of Persians are still held in slavery in Bokhara and Met v, and a few in Afghan Turkestan. The Russians liberated all Persian slaves in Khiva ; it is said to the number of 40,000; a great and noble deed, which has brought them much honour and a great accession of piestige among the Persians. In the neighbourhood of every village small towers are still seen, dotted about amongst the cultivation, where the people used to seek refuge when surprised by17 Turkoman raiders. In this part of the country these towers are allowed to fall into decay, being no longer required. The fortifications of Turhat Hidari are in a very ruinous condition, and can never have been formidable, a weak curtain wall connecting a few small mud towers being all the fortification it can boast of. For miles round Turhat Hidari the whole country is taken up either with mulberry plantations, for feeding silkworms, or else covered by fruit orchards, peaches, apricots, cherries, pears, apples, nuts, almonds, and walnuts being produced in great quantities. Nor are the cucurbitous fruits wanting ; melons, water-melons, and cucumbers, are plentiful, cheap, and good. The melons which ripen in the autumn, and which can be kept through the winter, are particularly good, very superior to the variety ripening in the summer. I have never seen this species of melon in Europe, the European melon being of the summer variety. I left Turbat Hidari on the 13th November, and marched to Sbor Hissar, distance 19 miles. A large plain is passed over until the tenth mile is reached, when the road winds about among some hills. At 15 miles an old and dirty caravanserai is reached, called Kesh Kuk. After K- sh Kuk is passed the road rapidly ascends, and at 17 miles the crest of the pass called Godar Baidar is reached, at a height of 6,700 feet. The road for about a mile would have to be made for guns, and they would have to be passed over by hand if this road was used ; there is, however, another but longer road, turning these hills. After leaving Godar Baidar the road rapidly descends, and at 19 miles enters a plain, where is situated a ruinous village, called Shor Hissar, with a poor caravanserai. On the 15th I marched from Shor Hissar to Kafir Kala, distance 24 mile*. At three miles the caravanserai of Miandasht is reached, and at five miles the fort of Kala Shazad i. The fort is a very weak one, but new and in good repair. At eight miles a ran^e of hills is entered, and 11 miles the crest of the pass called Godar Mahomad Mirza, which is 6,400 feet in height, it is a low easy pass, but the road would require making f..r guns in parts, especially near the crest. Alter leaving the crest the road rapidly descends, there are sever.il places on this road that could be held by an active enemy. At 16 miles the caravanserai of Robat Sufid is reached, situated in a plain, and at 24 miles the fort of Kafir Kala, which is on a steep hill. It is a small mud fort, not in very good repair, but its position renders it decidedly strong. It is inhabited by Turks, whose scanty beard and Tartar features proclaim them as being of pure Turk blood. The fort would be difficult to take without artillery. There is good grazing near this village, and I found a large camp of Iliats or nomads Tencamped near it; they were of the Timouri tribe, and had come Irom beyond the Persian border towards Herat for the,sake of the grazing. The next day I marched to Robat Turukh, distance 28 miles. At first the road leads through some low raviny ground, and at six miles the ruinous little caravanserai of Shah Tuggi is reached ; the road then passes over a plain, and at 10 miles, near a tower, it meets the main Teheran road; the road then enters some low hills, and at 12 miles passes the village of Sharifabad, where there are two large caravanserais and a post horse station. After passing Sharifabad the road is very bad, a series of low hills and ravines have to be crossed but at 28 miles the plain on which Mash-had is situated is reached, and here there is a large caravanserai called Robat Turukh. The road between Sharifabad and Turukh, though bad, is passable for guns. The whole road for some 14 miles was thickly covered with pilgrims, probably to the number of 4,000. I remained a few days at Robat Turukh, and sent my servant into Mash-had, distance about six miles, to get some information 1 wanted. On the 19th November l left Robat 1 urukh and rode toward IVlash-had, and went round two sides of the town, keeping about a mile from it. Neither of my servants were acquainted with the country, and I took no guide, as I did not wish any one to know where I w as going. I therefore could not even make inquiries as to the road. I however steered by compass to where I believed the Kuchan road to be, and struck it nicely. About ten miles beyond Ma*h-had I halted for the night at the village of Kazimabad. The population of this place were Taats. A great part of the population in this part of Khorasan is either Kurd or Turk, this place was not held by settlers horn outside, but by aborigines. Many of the villages near here have traditions of having been brought to this part of the country by Shah Ismail or Abbas the Great, but these people had no such tradit on. They understood the ordinary Persian language with difficulty; their tongue is evidently an older form of Persian, though many individuals understood ordinary Persian. Alter Khorasan was depopulated by Jenghiz Khan it seems to have been very 5757. Esparsely inhabited until the time of Shah Ismail and Shah Abbas, who brought large colonies of Kurds and Turks from other parts of Persia and settled them in Khurasan, •though undoubtedly there were Kurds in Khorasan previous to the time of Shah •Ismail. These were probably located here by the earlier kings of the Sassanian •dynasty. Many colonies of Turks were also settled here by Nadir Shah. The Kurds were brought and settled on this frontier, both as a protection against Turkomans and also against the Usbeg Turks of Khiva and Bokhara, who used periodically to plunder this part of the country. On the 20ih November I marched to Shangullah, nine miles. In this village there is a good room for travellers, with some Russian and Armenian writing scribbled on the walls. I heard that a party of 1,000 Turkoman horsemen and 500 footmen had just made a most successful raid into the Persian territory called Barkharz, situated between Mashad and Khaf, and carried off 3,000 sheep and 30 of the inhabitants as slaves, also some goods belonging to a trader. On the 14th November was the festival of the Eed-i-Kurban, when Mahomedans commemorate the sacrifice of Isaac, or, as they say, Ishmael, by Abraham. The Governor of Mash-had blew a Turkoman from a gun; the Turkoman had come into Mash-had of his own accord to trade, but was recognized as one who had attempted to carry off a Persian soldier into captivity, and was thus punished for the attempt. On the 22nd I marched to Radkan, distance 27 miles. At 16 miles the large village of Chinaran is reached, here I left the main Kuchan road, and took the road which leads to Daragez. The road, after leaving Chinaran, crosses a swamp, one of the sources of the Kashaf-rud river. At 25 miles the tower of Radkan is reached, a very fine specimen of ancient brickwork. It is a circular cone-shaped tower. The circle is formed of fluted brick columns. The roof has been covered with blue porcelain tiles, and there are the remains of an inscription in the Cufic character in blue porcelain letters. The inscription is illegible, but a few of the letters can still be traced, showing plainly in what character the inscription had been written. The inscription was in giant letters, each letter having been several feet high. I cannot at all imagine the object of this tower. It is not intended for defence, as there are no loop-holes or openings of any sort, except two doors opposite one another at the bottom. As the tower is very lofty and placed on rather high ground, it might have been intended as a look-out tower. The brickwork was in wonderfully good preservation, although ’it had lasted for so many centuries, as is proved by the character of the inscription. The interior had originally been divided into three storeys, hut the wooden floors had fallen in. A pair of ravens had built their nest at the apex of the cone, and wheeled about in the air frightened by my approach. There is a stair in the thickness of the wall, and the tower can be ascended for a considerable height though the stairs are in a very ruinous state. Tradition points to this tower as a shooting lodge of one of the Turkoman Kings of Persia. At 27 miles the small town of Radakan, of 4,000 inhabitants, is reached. The whole country between this place and Mash-had is very fertile and well cultivated, villages being very near one another. Every village is strongly fortified, the towers .and walls being kept in good repair. The walls are also higher, and the towers stronger, than in the parts of the country situated farther away from the Turkoman border. The gates are also strong, and closed and locked as soon as it is dark, every precaution being taken against surprise. The doors of these forts are their weak points, ami the Turkomans know this well, and always commence operations by p ling a heap of brushwood against them and burning them down. A slight plating of sheet iron would prevent this, but iron is too costly for this precaution to be taken except in considerable towns. The whole country from Mash-had to Daragez is rich, and would afford supplies even for a large army without difficulty. Cattle and corn are plentiful, and camels and donkeys for carriage could be procured in large number s. Tire donkeys in this part of the country, though small, are very efficient beasts of burden. An ordinary donkey will carry 150 lbs. without difficulty, and they could be procured irr almost unlimited numbers. A few’ mules and baggage ponies could be had. The camel of this part of Khorasan is a magnificent animal. The best camels are a cross betu een the two humped Bactrian camel and the one-humped Arabian camel. The produce is an animal superior to either of its parents in size and carrying power. A fine camel ot this breed is a magnificent looking animal, and stands cold and exposure far better , than the Arabian or Persian camel. The breed rapidly deteriorates if allowed to breed among themselves, the first cross being far the best. The ordinary load of a Persian camel is 320 lbs., of a good Indian camel 400 lbs., while these cross-bred19 camels carry with ease a load of 600 lbs., and I have even heard of a fine specimen carrying 800 lbs. when short marches are made. Persians make much longer marches with their camels than I have ever seen done in India. In India 18 or 20 miles is considered a long march for camels, but in Persia 30 miles, or even more, is not considered too long a march for them. Persian camels will continue marching at this rate for several days together, but in Persia camels are very differently treated. They are carefully fed on barley meal and chaff when ever forage is scarce. They also have warm clothing, and in very cold weather are stabled. The Khorasan variety being covered with long hair can stand very much greater cold than the Arabian camel, which is the variety common in India. The mortality amongst the camels during the first year of the late Afghan war was terrible. 1 have heard it estimated at from 70,000 upwards. A great part of this loss I attribute to ignorance. Our natural history books have taught us that camels require very little food and less water. This is totally untrue, camels require about the same bulk of food as a small horse, that is to say, a camel to be kept in working condition must get about 22 lbs. weight of food each day. It is true he will be contented with food of an inferior quality to that supplied to a horse. Bushes, twigs, and thorny leaves are the food the camel prefers and thrives best on, but, when these are not procurable in sufficient quantity, he must be supplied with about 5 lbs. of grain and 17 lbs. of chaff per day. Water also in hot weather should be given them at least twice a day. A camel can go without water for 48 hours and work. After that it requires to be watered, otherwise it suffers terribly. 'Phis is my own expe rience, and I have had a pretty wide one, both in charge of camels, the property of Government, and with hired camels in different countries. I have heard of camels who have, been trained to do so, going four days without water, and being only watered on the fifth morning, but this is an extraordinary feat. If camels get the whole of their food by grazing, they will require at least seven hours’actu d grazing besides the time required to go and return. If camels come in only half full from grazing, at least 4 lbs. of grain and 10 lbs. of chaff should be given them. From Hadakan 1 man hed, on the 3rd November, to Dautli, distance 22 miles. The road the whole way skirted the hills, just keeping in the plain. Dautli is a village inhabited by Turks, and the men are some of the finest specimens of humanity I have ever seen. It is a rich village, and contains about 400 inhabitants. The next day I marched to Derbendi, di&gt;tance 19 miles. At eight miles the village of Badkhor is passed, arid at 10.^ miles the village of Towarik. Between Badkhor and Towarik the road skirts a fine stream, which is the Atrek river. The Atrek is crossed at Towarik by a small bridge. The source of the Atrek is situated in the mountain range a few miles beyond Towarik. After passing this village a high hill is climbed by a very bad road, impassable to anything but mountain guns. When the crest of the h ll is reached, there is a plain called Maidan Kuni, or the Bloody Plateau, from the number of people who per ish here every winter from the cold. There was a hitler north wind blowing that chilled one to the very bones. It also sno*ved while we were on the march to-day, but, fortunately, not while we were on the cr e-t of the pass. This pass, difficult though it is, is the easiest road between Persia proper an 1 the outlying province of Daragez, but for many weeks in the winter all communication is closed. The plateau of Maidan Kuni is the watershed of these mountains; the rivers, as the Atrek, which rise on their western slopes flow into the Caspian Sea, while th »&gt;e which ri&gt;e on the eastern slope flow towards the Tcjend river, and are lost in the Kara Kun desert. Persians have on one or two occasions taken field guns over these mountains with great difficulty, but not by the exact route travelled by me. After passing the Maidan Kuni plateau, the road descends very abruptly to the village of Derbendi. Th re are three small villages all bearing this name some little distance apait. On the 25th November, I marched to Mahomadabad, the capital of the small Persian province of Daragez,distance 20 miles. After four miles the ascent of the Allaho-Akbar pass is commenced. This ascent is very steep and had, and lasts for about 3| miles. As soon as the crest of the pass is reached, there is a good winding hill mad to the plain of Daragez, which is reached at 11^ miles from Derbeudi. There is a splendid view from the top of the Allaho-Akbar pas*, which is at this point 4,200 feet in height. The Maidan Kuni pass is considerably higher. The day was not a par. icularly clear one, but a good view was obtained ot the gieat Turkoman plain stretching away in the far distance. There are several low ranges of hills crossing the Daragez plain, but no mountain ranges. In every direction villages and cultivation are seen, showing it to be a fertile and well watered country. Every one speaks of Daragez as one of the most fertile districts of Persia, and as a country which, if freed from Turkoman raids, would be the garden of the Land. A very peculiar leature of the20 country was the number of small towers dotted in every direction to enable the people to seek refuge from the Turkomans if surprised by them in the open. Soon after the plain is reached the village of Chapashli is seen some distance to the right. Eight years ao-o 300 of the inhabitants of this village were carried off into slavery by the Turkomans. The vineyards of Chapashli are celebrated all over Khorassan. Forty- five pounds of good grapes can here be purchased for 9d. At 10 miles the village of Hakwerdi is passed, the road running through a low range of hills, beyond which the whole country up to Mahomadabad is a series of vineyards and fruit gardens, each garden containing one or more high towers for defence. Close to Hakwerdi the small refuse towers are extraordinarily numerous, one being placed in every square of 150 yards over the whole of the fields. These refuge towers are worthy of de cnption. They are quite different from the defence towers, which are also numerous. They are small and about 1*2 feet high ; they have no opening or loop-hole of any description, except a -mall hole at the bottom, through which a not very stout person could force himself with some difficulty. If surprised by Turkomans the cultivator or traveller creeps through this hole, and closes it with two large stones which are there for the purpose. Even if these stones are wanting the occupant is safe, as it would indeed be a brave Turkoman who would wriggle himself through the hole with the certainty of having his skull cracked by a blow from a stone, supposing the occupant was provided with no better weapon. The defence towers are much higher and larger, have a parapet at the top, and loop holes, also machacoulis, to enable the defenders to fire, or drop down stones on the heads of their assailants who may be trying to burn the door of the tower. I reached Mahomadabad about three o’clock in the afternoon, and took up my quarters in the caravanserai. CHAPTER IV. Account of Turkoman Slave-raiding. I propose to make a considerable stay in Mahomadabad, and to purchase Turkoman horses and Turkoman carpets to keep up my character of an Armenian trader Mahomadabad is a particularly good place to obtain information, both of the Akhal Tekeh country and of the Merv Tekeh country, it being situated two marches from Askabad one of the chief places of the Akhal tekeh, and six marches from the Merv Tekeh country. Caravans continually arrive from both places, while the Akhal Tekeh come in, both singly and in small parties, to make their purchases in the bazars of Mahomadabad. It is a place of about 5,000 inhabitants, and the bazars are well supplied with goods both from Russia and England. Daragez projects beyond the ran r e of mountains which forms elsewhere the boundary of Persian Khorasan. The Persian dominion in Daragez and the Atak, or plain country beyond, is a survival of the Persian dominion which once embraced the whole country to the Amu or Oxus river Nadir Shah, the last King of Persia who ruled it in its full extent, and whose orders were obeyed from Georgia to Kandahar, and from Bagdad on the banks of the Tigris to the banks of the Oxus, who humbled the pride of the Sultans of Constantinople, and plundered Delhi, the capital of the Great Mogul, only died in A.D. 1747. He was horn in a tent about one mile from Mahomadabad, ot an lliat, or tent-dwelling family of the Turk tribe of Afshar. He himself built a small fort to mark the site of his hirth place, which I visited. It is in ruins, and is known as Moulud Nadiri. I have called him of the Turk tribe of Afshar, but Nadir Shah always described himself a Turkoman. In those days the AEhar tribe, with many other Turk tribes of Persia called themselves Turkoman. In the history ot Nadir Shah called the Jehan’msha, written by Mirza Mehdi Khan Astrabadi, he is always spoken of as a Turkoman of the ti ibe of Afdhar. In a letter still preserved, w ritten by Nadir Shah to his son after the capture of Delhi, he speaks of treating the Emperor of India with courtesy because they were both of Turkoman descent. Also, in the wars of the Turkoman tribes called “Turkomans of the White Sheep ” and “ Turkomans of the Black Sheep,” from the figures of those animals which they carried on their standards, many tubes were included which are now no longer known as Turkoman. Uzun Husain, the chief of the “ Turkomans of the White Sheep/' whose capital w as at Diarbekir, in Kurdistan, was King of Persia in A.D. 1475. And the “ r l urko-US 21 mans of the Black Sheep” had their head-quarters at Van, in Armenia. This shows that the name “Turkoman” had a much wider significance in former days than it now has. At present, the name Turkoman is confined to the Turk nomads who inhabit the country between the Caspinn Sea and the Oxus river. Some Turkomans are found on the further side of the Oxus towards Bokhara, but their chief seat is in the before- named tract of country. The name of Turkoman, so much dreaded by the inhabitants of Persia, who have suffered so severely for many years from the slave stealing inroads of the desert Turkomans, is now never applied to themselves by the Afshar or any other Turk tribe of Persia. Since the death of Nadir Shah these barbarous warriors have ravaged Persian Khorasan almost at their own sweet will, carrying off the inhabitants in thousands into hopeless slavery. The number of Persian slaves held in Bokh ra, Khiva, and the Turkoman country itself was estimated years ago to be at least 100,OUO. During the last thirty years the incursions of the Turkomans have decreased in frequency, and have not extended so far into the country as they formerly did. Turkoman bands used formerly to ravage and plunder almost up to the gates of Isfahan, which is situated more than -500 miles from the nearest Turkoman border. It is not surprising that the Turk tribes of Persia, to which the Kajar or reigning family belongs, do not wish to be confounded with these savage man-stealers, though they descended from the same sto^k. Many causes have contributed to curb the power of the Turkoman tribes for mischief. The Goklnns, one of the most notoiious slave stealing tribes in former times, have quite fallen under the power of Persia, and now seldom or never engaged in slave dealing. The Yomuts, who formerly dealt much in slaves and raided frequently into Persia, have also fallen under the power of Russia. The same may be said of the Chowdur tribe of Turkomans, and the same remark applies with even more force to the Akhal Tekeh, whose country is now r incorporated into the new Trans-Caspian province of Russia. The Merv Tekeh and the Saruk tribes are the only ones w'ho still engage in slaving raids. A great deal has been done by Russia to prevent the slave trade by the closing of the markets in the towns of Bokhara and Khiva. A few slaves, especially females, can no doubt still be sold secretly in Bokhara, but the capture of slaves has ceased to be profitable an occupation as it formerly was. They are still carried off for use in the Tmkoman country itself, and for the sake of the ransom paid by their friends for their liberation. Not only has the price of slaves fallen, hut the difficulties of capture have vastly increased. The causes of the increased difficulties are twofold. Firstly, one of the best places for slave catching, and the.place whence many were formerly carried off, was between Miandasht and Sabzawar on the Teheran and Mash-had road, where the great pilgrim caravans pass. Now that hunting ground is entirely closed to the Turkomans, the Russians occupying the country to the north ward, across which the slaves would have to he carried. Second, the Persians have established telegraph stations at so many points on the road that the nesvs of a raid is flashed far and wide on the wires, and Persian horsemen can be summoned in time to prevent the successful carrying off of slaves and booty. Even the bolder spirits of the Merv Tekeh and Saruk Turkoman tribes prefer to raid on the Russian line of com munications rather than organize slaving parties in Persia, in consequence of the reduced value of slaves. In spite, however, of all this, more human beings are carried into captivity and a cruel slavery than one likes at all to think of. During my residence of three months on the Turkoman frontier I heard of more than sixty people being carried off. 1 tried to rent a house in Mohamadabad, as I did riot like the publicity of living in the caravanserai, hut I could not succeed in getting one. I called upon the Persian Governor, who is named Mahomad Aly Khan, and has the title of Begler Begi from the Shah. The governorship of Daragez is hereditary in the family of the Begler Begi, and though the Shah occasionally changes the Governor he always appoints a man of this family, who, besides the title of Begler Begi, holds the rank of Surtip-i-awul or general &lt; f the first class in the Persian army. He received me very civilly, and 1 presented him with a double-bar relied gun and silver-plated revolver of the newest pattern, with which he was much pleased. He ordered a house to be provided for me, and gave me a shop in the bazar tor the trans action of business. Many inquiries were made by him about India and the position of Anmnians in that country. 1 soon took possession of the house given me, where I used to receive Turkoman and other traders from Merv. 1 also used to visit the 5757. F22 bazars daily to converse with the Turkomans who came in both from Merv and the Akhal Tekeh country. Though I accepted the shop, I never occupied it, as I had no goods to expose for sale. My time was chiefly taken up in examining horses of Turkoman breed that were brought to me for sale, and collecting information. CHAPTER Y. Turkomans. The country inhabited by the tribes now known under the name of Turkoman extends from the Caspian Sea to the Oxus river. It bears no general name and a great part of it is taken up by the sands of the Kara Kum or Black Sand Desert; it is bounded on the north by the kingdom of Kbarezm, known to Europeans as Khiva, and on the south by Persia and Afghanistan. It is watered by two considerable rivers besides the Oxus, one of these, the Murghab, rises far away in the Safid Kuh or white mountains of Afghanistan, and after a long course it loses itselt in the sands of the Kara Kum Desert, but before doing so it renders fertile a long narrow strip of country on both its banks. From the point where the Murghab river crosses the Afghan border to the point where it is lost in the desert, the country has always been celebrated as one of the most fertile in the world. It was known to the ancient Greeks as Margiana, and was visited by Alexander the Great. Balk, Merv, and Seistan were the earliest seats of Persian civilization. Merv, the city on the Murghab river, has always held a high place in Persian history. It was during the reign of the Sassanian kings of Persia, the seat of a Christian Archbishop of the Nestorian church up to 666. During the Arab dominion, when the Khalits ot Bagdad ruled over Khurasan, their deputy or governor lived at Merv, and the Khalif A1 Momein during the lifetime of his father Harun-ur-Rushid dwelt there. Phis city was captured by the Arab invaders about A.D. 666. The last king ot the old Zoroastrian dynasty, named Zedegird, was slain near Merv by a treacherous subject with whom he had taken refuge. The enormous sums of money taken back to their own land by the Arab invaders who after the capture of Merv plundered the country up to and beyond the Oxus river, in A.D. 666, show how rich these lands must have been. Merv was known to the Persians under the title of Shah Jehan or “ King ot the “World,” in honour of its fertility and natural wealth. Tului, the son of Jenghiz Khan, when he captured and plundered the place in A.D. 1221, is said to have put 700,000 of its inhabitants to death besides those he carried away captive. Merv, Herat, and Nishabur are always mentioned as three of the wealthiest cities of Central Asia in former times. I only bring forward these facts to show what the country once was, and what it may again become under a civilized Government. The Turkoman country watered by the Tejend or Huri-Rud river is not so rich as that watered by the Murghab. The Tejend or Huri-Rud rising in Afghanistan in the Siah Kuh, or Black Moun tains, has a longer course than the Murghab, but only a small portion of it flows through the Turkoman country, and in that part its volume is much diminished by the numerous canals drawn from it to water the country near Herat. The Huri Rud, after passing Herat and Ghurian, turns northward, and from Toman Agha forms the boundary between Afghanistan and Persia. From a point a little northward of Sarakhs both banks of the Tejend until it is finally lost in the Kara Kum desert are Turkoman property. The ancient city of Syrinx was situated on the eastern bank of the Tejend river, probably opposite the present Persian post of Sarakhs. The ruins of a town formerly known as Sarakhs are to be seen here- It was destroyed by the Persian Crown Prince Abbas Mirza in A.D. 1830. The whole of its population, who were Turko mans of the Salor tribe, were either slain or carried away captive. The ruins of ancient Syrinx would probably be found somewhere near the ruins of this place. Formerly a canal from the Tejend river ran a long way out into the desert country between the Tejend and the Murghab, rendering the journey from Sarakhs to Merv jnuch easier than it is at present.lit % 23 In a land the rainfall of which is so small as th;»r of this part of the world, cultiva tion depends entirely upon the keeping up of canals, and the most fertile land relapses into desert if the irrigation is not maintained. The banks of the Murghab and Tejend have been for ages the battle fields where the contest for supremacy has taken place between Iran and Turan, or the Aryan and Turanian races, and no land has so often been devastated by conquering hordes. CHAPTER V |. Division into Tkibks. The Turkomans are divided into tribes who have little or no connection with one another, and these tribes are again subdivided into sections. I will give the names of the chief tribes, with a rough estimate of the numbers of tents belonging to each. This list and enumeration was given me by the Begler Begi, and it was corrected by long conversations on the subject with Allah \ ar Beg, a confidential servant of Makdum Kuli Khan, the Chief of the Akhal Tekeh. Allah Yar Beg, who is himself of the Eyrsari tribe of Turkomans that inhabit the left bank of the Oxus, had been sent into Mahomadabad by his master on some business with the Begler Begi of a confidential character. 1 also went over the subject with many other people who had any knowledge of it so as to correct mistakes. So far as the Tekeh Turkomans are concerned, I can rely upon my information being correct, as I was able to converse with so many people of this tribe, and with many Persians who had lived as slaves amongst them; also with traders who dwelt there. Of the Salor, Saruk, and Eyrsari my information is also reliable, but of the Yomut, Chowdur, and Goklan tribes I know much less. This is not important, as the Yomuts and Goklans have been written about bv many other travellers, while the Tekeh, who I know best, are probably the least known, while they are the most important tribe. The Turkomans are divided as follows:— Eyrsari, left bank of the Oxus Tekeh Damam-i-Kuh and Merv couni-i \ Salor (5,000 tents—have been enumerated amongst Merv Tekeh). Yomut, near Caspian Sea and Atrak river Saruk, banks of Murghab river Chowdur, near Caspian Sea and Khiva Goklan, near Atrak river - - - - Kara, in desert beyond Murghab Alehli, neai^ Andkhoy, also near Abiverd Tents. 75.000 65.000 40.000 11.000 12,000 8,000 2,000 2,000 Total - 216,000 1 believe five persons to a tent would represent the population. If we multiply 216,000 by 5 we have 1,080,000 as the population of the Turkoman country. Con sidering the enormous extent of the country oceupied, 1 do not at all think this an excessive estimate, but rather below the truth. Besides these recognized great tribes, there are many small tribes which I have mu ^numerated, either because they are counted with other tribes in the enumeration, or are not of sufficient importance to be enumerated. 1 will first describe the Tekeh Turkomans before proceeding to a description of the other tribes. Tekeh means wild goat. It is the name of the Persian ibex in Turki, and is also applied to the old goat who leads tin* flock of tame goats. Many of the minor subdivisions of the tribes have the names of animals, and “ wild goat ” is an appropriate name for this wild people. The Tekeh are divided by their position into Akhal Tekeh and Merv Tekeh, hut this is only a geographical divbion. The Akhal Tekeh have 25,000 tents, and inhabit tho Daman-i-koh, or Atak country. Daman-i- Kuh means skirt of the mountains, and is the name of the country skirting the moun tain range which borders the northern part of tin* Persian province of Khorasan.Many small streams take their rise in these mountains, and flows towards the Karu- Kuni desert, where they are lost in the sand. These small streams in their course fertilize the country they pass through, and the Daman-i-Kuh is far from being the desert which it has generally been represented. No doubt, to a person fre^h from the green fields of England, this country might appear barren enough; it produces, how- ever a very considerable quantity of corn and fruit, and in previous times, before it became the home of the wild people who now dwell the re, supported a lar-e Persian population, who have been driven out or carried away into slavery. I have met the descendants of many Persians who had fled into Persia from the Daman-i-Kuh when it was occupied by the Tekeh, and v\ho still cast a longing eye on their ancestral lands, and who, now that this country has become a province of Russia, will return and cultivate those lands. Kizzil Arvat is the first Tekeh village to the westward, and the Akhal Tekeh country extends from that place to the Tejend river. Between the Tejend river and the Merv Tekeh country there is a desert, which has cau-ed a geographical separation between the two parts of the tribe. All Tekeh Turkomans, whether living in the Akhal or the Merv country, are firstly divided into Otamish and ! ocktamish. Otamish and Pocktamish weie two bro.lurs, from which these two divisions claim descent. These ore again divided, the Otamish into Suchmuz and Bukshi, and the Tock- tamish info Wakil and Beg. It is important to remember these four Tekeh clans. Suchmuz and Bukshi, Wakil and Beg, for all the politics of this part of the world hang upon the alliances or disunion of these four subdivisions of the 1 ekeh tribe. In the Daman-i-Kuh, where the fighting against the Russians has necessitated the election (fa single chief with supreme power to control the whole of the population, Mukdum Kuli Khan, who is of the Wakil subdivision, has been chosen chief, and given the power of life and death, which power he exercised repeatedly during the . siege of Yangi Shahr. He is the son of Nur Verdi Khan, who was a most powerful chief both in the Akhal Tekeh and Merv Tekeh country. Nur Verdi Khan only died a few years ago. He married an Akhal Tekeh wife, by whom he had Mukdum Kuli Khan* He also married Jamal Baie, a woman of the Beg clan, living in the Merv country, and bv this lady had a son named Mahomad Yusuf Khan, w ho is at present the chief of the Wakil subdivision in the Merv country. This family is, therefore, much the most influential in the whole country. In the Akhal Tekeh country, beside Mukdum Kuli Khan, who w'as the paramount chief, there was a fighting chief, Awaz Murad, called Takmeh Sirdar. r l his man is a notorious free booter, and leader of alamans, as their plundering parties are named. He formerly marie a name by leading forays and kidnapping many slaves, on the great qaravan road betw een T&lt; heran and Ma&gt;h-hari, near Miandasht. He is the man who once carried off an Oude princess. He is undoubtedly an intrepid leader of alamans. Some years ago he entered the service of Rus:da, and commanded a party of Turkoman horse in the service of that Power. However, on the defeat of General Lomakine, near Geok Tepe, in 1879, he deserted the Russian service, and joined Mukdum Kuli Khan. Mukdum Kuli Khan at fir&gt;t bad some idea of putting him to death, but. on second thoughts, he determined to forgive him and employ him himself. He was, I believe, partially persuaded to take this course in consequence of a btter he icceived from Abbas Khan, the British Agent at Mash-had, v ho wrote to him iccommending him to forgive Takmeh Sirdar, as, putting to death so renowned a leader, would cause dis union amongst the r l ekeh tribe. Abbas Khan wa§, himself, when a boy, can ed off by the Turkomans, and kept a prisoner in the Akhal Tekeh country until ransomed for a large sum, so he is a&lt; quainted with 1 urkoman ways. Awaz Murad, called Takameh Sirdar, is the man who has now again joined the Russians, and headed the deputation of Akhal Tekeh who have visited St. Petersburg and seen the Emperor of Russia. He is also the man who is said to have made a speech to the Czar on the subject of the Akhal i ekeh, showing their taithfu ness to Russia. The speech did not come particularly well from one who has changed sides three times in four or five years. 1 he necessity of union to meet the Russian invasion, and the election of a single paran ount chief, has rather broken down the clan distinctions in the Akhal 1 ekeh count!y, 1 ut, in the Merv country, the distinctions between the four subdivisions of the tribe are very marked. 1 will i ow describe the location of the subdivisions in the Merv I ekeh courttry. Cn the wextern l ank of the river Murghab live the Suehmuz and the Buk.^hi sub divisions. r J he Bukshi to the south and the 8uchmuz to the north. On the east, side side of the Muighab live the Beg and Wakil subdivisions. I gather that the most25 fertile land is on the eastern bank of the Murghab, and the Wakil and Beg have more importance politically amongst the Tekeh than the other two clans. This is partly owin&lt;; to their more complete subjugation to a paramount chief, and their acting together. The strength of the Tekeh population in the Merv country is always stated as follows:— Suchmuz Bukshi Beg Wakil 10,000 tents. 10,000 „ 10,000 „ 10,000 „ Total - - - 40,000 In this are included 5,000 tents of the Salor Turkomans, whose history is an instructive one. The Salor were formerly a very powerful tribe, and were settled in the country between the Murghab and Tejend rivers long before the Tekeh appeared in the country. They lived in the town of Sarakhs, the ruins of which can now be seen on the eastern side of the Tejend, a few miles from the present Persian fort which bears the same name, but which is situated on the western side of the Tejend river. Their town was captured and a large number of them put to death by Abbas Mirza, the Persian Crown Prince, in 1830. He carried away captive some thousands of families, and settled them at Zohrabad, within the Persian frontier. In those days the Tekeh were rather friendly to Persia. About A.D. 1834 the Tekeh commenced settling in considerable numbers on the Murghab river, crossing over from the Akhal Tekeh country, where they had been settled for about 100 years. As they gained strength on the Murghab they drove the Saruk tribe further up the Murghab, not allowing any Saruk to live further down the river than Yullatun. After a time they found that the Salor Turkomans who had been settled within the Persian borders by Abbas Mirza were a great hindrance to their plundering raids into Persia Khorasan, in the neigh bourhood of Mash-had. They therefore determined upon a bold stroke, and, partly by force and partly by persuasion, the whole of the Salor trihe settled within the Persian border were carried away to the Merv country, and settled amongst the Tekeh on the Murghab, a few families in each division. The power of the Salor, who are now supposed to number only 5,000 tents, was completely broken. At Yullatun, which is situated some 45 miles further up the river than the Tekeh head-quarters, there are said to be 4,(XX) Saruk tents, and five days’ journey still further up the Murghab river, at Punj Deh, there are said to be 7,000 more tents of this tribe. The total population of the Merv country, or that fertilized by the Murghab river, may thus be put down at Tekeh, 40,000 tents, and Saruk 11,000 tents, or a total of 51,000 tents. This, at five persons each, would give *255,000 persons as the popula tion of the tract. I know that this is a very small number in comparison with the population that this country once supported, but it is large when one considers that there are no towns, and that these are all nomads dwelling in tents. Having given a rough estimate of the population, and shown the position in which each tribe or subdivision dwell on the Murghab, I will now proceed to speak of Merv. There have been several towns or cities hearing this name, but at present there is no such place. A great deal of confusion has been occasioned by the loose way in which the Persians speak of and describe Merv, and the few travellers who have visited the place have rather added to the confusion. One Merv was destroyed by the Moguls. Tului, a son of Jengiz Khan, laid siege to it on the 25th February 1221, and captured the place. He is said, by Ibn-ul-Ethir. to have put 700,000 of its inhabitants to death, besides those he carried away captive. In eastern countries a town is seldom built on its ancient site, as it is considered unlucky ; it is also far easier to build on a fresh one. The ruins of the town destroyed by the Moguls is situated in the country of the Wakil clan, east and a little north of Kala Koushid Khan. # The next town called Merv was the one now known as the Merv of Bairam AH Khan, from the noble defence of it made by that chief. The ruins of it are also situated in the country of the Wakil clan. Shah Tamasp I., a king of the Suffivian dynasty, transferred a portion of the Kajar tribe to Merv about A.D. 1530, and entrusted the defence of that important city to them. The Kajars were one of the Kizzil Bash tribes of Persia, and were of Turk origin. When Shah Ismail, the first of the Suffivian kings of Persia, obtained the 5757. 6 *26 throne he gave permission to wear a distinguishing dress, including a red cap, to seven of the Turk tribes who had helped him most in the wars which led to his obtaining the throne. The Kajar tribe was one of those who were permitted to wear this dress, and from the red cap which formed a portion of the dress these tribes were known as Kizzil Bash, a name which has in many eastern lands come to be employed for almost any Persian, but which was originally used for these particular tribes. The Merv defended by the Kajars was attacked by Beggi Jan, also called Amir Masum, of Bokhara, in 1874, and was nobly defended by Bairam Ali Khan Kajar and his son, Hoosein Aly Khan. Bairam Aly Khan was killed outside the town, and his son con tinued the defence, but in vain. After the most heroic resistance, in which even the women joined, the place was taken and the population was carried captive to Bokhara and sold as slaves. Beggi Jan broke down the great dam on the Murghab which filled the canals, and tried his best to render the country a desert. At this time no assistance could be sent from Persia to Hoosein Aly Khan, as the country was distracted by the struggle going on for the kingdom between Agha Mahomad Khan Kajar and Lootf Aly Khan. Well did the Kajars defend Merv until all hope was fled, and Hoosein Aly Khan was honourably received after his escape from Bokhara at Teheran, where he found another branch of the Kajar family in possession of the throne of Persia. After Beggi Jan had destroyed Merv and the dam, the country did for a time become desert, but it was too rich a land to be left entirely desolate. Some Salor and Saruk Turkomans lived in it, and gradually, after a good many years, the band or dam over the river was repaired, and a certain amount of fertility restored to the country. In these lands fertility does not all at once return to a country. Much labour is required in making canals and irrigation works before fields that have once relapsed into desert can be reclaimed, and the sandy soil refreshed by the alluvium brought down by the rivers. Beggi Jan, the Amir of Bokhara, plundered Khorasan in every direction. The ruins of 350 villages in the piece of country between Mash-had and the Tejend river alone are pointed out as his work. The Persian population of the whole country was carried away into captivity, and Khorasan and the Merv country have never recovered from the fearful blow then inflicted. The lands along the Keshuf Rud, an affluent of the Tejend, the Tejend itself, and the Murghab, only await a civilized Government and protection from Turkoman raids to be what they once were, the fertile homes of millions of people. For many years after the loss of the Merv country no effort was made by Persia to recover it, and the almost deserted land was nominally subject to Bokhara. After a time it was, however, taken possession of by the Khan of Kharizm, or Khiva. I have not been able to ascertain the exact year when the Khivans became possessed of the Merv country, but it was only a few years before it was visited by Abbott, Thomson, and others. Abbott visited it in 1840. At that time the Khivan officials lived in a wretched village called Mowr or Merv, of about 100 mud huts. This place was a fort of the Saruk tribe, and was captured by the Tekehs when they drove the Saruk tribe further up the river to Yullatun, probably about 1855. It has been for many years deserted. This is the place which was found unoccupied and was taken possession of by Persian armies in 1857 and I860, and a great parade made at Teheran of the captur e of Merv. By Merv, this deserted village was meant. At present, in all the Merv country, there is no place that is worthy to be called a town. On the eastern hank of the most westerly branch of the Murghab river, on the lands of the Beg clan of the Toctamish subdivision of the Tekeh, a very large fort has been built. It is called Kala Koushid Khan, or the fort of Koushid Khan, that having been the name of the Turkoman chief who persuaded the whole of the tribe to unite in building this fort. It is 25 miles below the great dam on the Murghab. The place where the dam is situated is called Benti, and is a Turkoman settlement of some importance. Here is also Allasha, where there is a ferry over the Murghab for a few weeks in the spring when the river is in high flood. The Turkomans commenced to build the fort of Koushid Khan in 1860, when the Merv country was invaded by Hamza Mirza Hashmut-ud-Dowlah, but very little was then done, as the Persians were disastrously defeated when attacking this place, then in a very incipient state, so there was no necessity for a fortress of refuge. After the capture of Khiva by the Russians the Turkomans were alarmed, and great eff its were made to complete the fort, which was worked at lor several months by some thousands of men. The death of Koushid Khan, however, was a blow, and the fort though made strong was nut com pleted. I here insert a short account of the fort extract* d from a letter dated 1st May 1881, which I have within the last few days received from Mr. O’Donovan, the “ Daily News ” correspondent, dated Kala Koushid Khan. This description talliesgenerally with what I have heard from the Turkomans. He says, “ The fort is a “ quadrangular place, about miles long by about wide. The greatest length “runs nearly N.E. and S.W. The great loop of the river forms a natural fosse. “ The embankment of the fortress,” he says, “ is 60 feet thick at the base and 30 feet “ high. The top is crowned with a parapet of loamy mud four feet thick.” He says, “ Faulty as is the construction, in view of its remoteness and the difficulty of bringing “ up a battering train, it is now a formidable fortress, within which 50,000 or 60,003 “ men can be concentrated and provisioned for a couple of years.” I received a good account of this place from Sari Beg, a Turkoman merchant, and also from Syd Alv Khan, a Persian official who had been sent to Merv to negotiate with the Turkomans a treaty by which they were to place themselves under Persian authority. This arrangement broke down, not from any unwillingness of the Turkomans to agree, but because the Shah was afraid to accept the submission of the Turko nans for fear of offending his powerful neighbour Russia, who would have objected to any extension of the'Persian frontier towards the Merv country. There are no houses in the fort except a house or two belonging to the family of Koushid Khan, and perhaps a few guest houses belonging to another chief. In this fort, or sometimes outside it, on the bank of the river, a market is held to which some Jew r traders from Herat and Mash-had resort. They have built small enclosures without any roofs, where they sit and expose their goods. Sheep and camels are also bought for sale. When Turkomans speak of the bazaar at Kala Koushid Khan this open air market is meant. The Jew traders that I have spoken of live with different powerful Turkomans, who protect them. Each Jew trader has, as a rule, one protector. Two Jews are seldom under the protection of one person. If any one takes goods without full payment from the Jew, or insults him, it is looked upon as an insult by the Jews protector, who immediately takes the part of the Jew. In the fort there are some alajaks, or felt tents, pitched; often those of Turkoman traders or carriers. Goods for Bokhara, and a small quantity for the Merv country, are entrusted to Turkoman carriers, who own a number of camels by merchants of Mash-had, and those goods are delivered safely at their destination, and the price brought back by the carriers to the merchant at Mash-had. Of course the amount of trade carried on is not very great, still many hundreds of camels are engaged in this traffic, and some of the Turkoman merchants are fairly rich. Sari Beg, a merchant who trades between Daragez and Bokhara, talked much with me, and in Mashad I collected a great deal of information from Baiza Beg, a camel owner, who carries goods between that place and Kala Koushid Khan, and whose alajak is generally pitched in the fort itself. Outside the fort of Koushid Khan there are numbers of tents pitched, generally about 6,000 in number. Each chief man, besides his tent, has a small guest chamber, where honoured guests are installed; these are often built of sun-burnt brick. They are not collected together, and there is nothing that can be called a town or even village, but they are scattered about the country. The chief Mahomedan priest of the Beg clan has built a school for boys near the fort of Koushid Khan. His name is Mollah Turah, and he and the priests who teach in the school have five or six houses together, surrounded by a wall. This is the only place that has any resemblance to a village. The Persians mean Kala Koushid Khan when they speak of Merv. The name Merv, as applied tp a town, is quite unknown to the Turkomans, who, when they use it, mean a tract of country. Persians who were in this part of the country, either with the armies of Sultan Murad Mirza Hissam-U Sultunut, in 1857, or with the army of Hamza Mirza Hashmat-ud-Dowlah, in I860, when they speak of Merv, mean an old fort now gone to ruin on the other side of the Murghab, where these armies remained, but applying the name to this place is quite incorrect, and was, 1 believe, done to convey a false impression at Teheran as to the magnitude of the success achieved by those princes. There are several wooden bridges both above and below the fort, by which communication is kept up from the side of the river belonging to the Beg clan with the side of the river owned by the Suchmuz and Bukshi clans. The v\ooden bridges are private property. No charge is made for foot passengers, but a small charge is made for horses. About seven horses would pay a kran, value ninepence. When the Murghab comes down in flood boats have to he used for crossing, but this does not last long. The boats are regular wooden boats. In summer the Murghab is sometimes dry in the lower part of its course. The dam at Benti I have no doubt is the remains of the old dam destroyed by the Amir of Bokhara in 1784, and now repaired. A regular levy of the population is made every year, and a workman is supplied by each group of tents for tne repair of the band or\ n Tan thousand men are about the number employed in this work yearly. The Wakil dan* have* the first right to the water, and their branch of the river or large canal 'ors north-east from near the band to their chief camp, which is called Oubah Wakif or the camp of the Wakils. Here lives their Chief, Mahomed Ynsuf Khan the s„n of Nur Verdi Khan. The Wakil are the most powerful clan of the lour 1 ekeh o ans but there is no fort like that of Koushid Khan in their country. The old ruined for of Merv the city of Bairam Aly Khan Kajar, can still be traced, and is (con- siderine the time that' has elapsed since its destruction) in good preservation Near it are some more ruins, said to he those of the Merv of the time ot the Khahf A1 Monrein* destroyed by Tului, the son of Jenghrz Khan. A third Merv of still older “ate called Kala Goehr, or Fort of the Fire-worshippers, is said also to he found in the same neighbourhood. In the Wakil tribe there is no chief to compare with Mahomad Yusuf Khan. I suppose now that his half-brother, Mukdum Kuli Khan, W X , refuge in the Merv country, he will have a share of the power ,n this tribe hut 1 do not feel certain of this, as he is of the Akhal Tekeh division of he Wakils In the neighbouring clan of Beg the chief men are the sons of Koushid Khan ' There are three sons of Koushid Khan, who are men of influence, Baha Khan’, Kalah Khan, and Nawhut Khan. Three other sons also live in the Beg country, ^Every^ection'of the Afferent clans has a sort of sub-chief called a khetiskoda, and these Jen have a good deal of power. There are, I believe, 24 khetkhodas m the Merv country, hut there may he more. These men meet and elect a chief in times of [rouble. A man called'Kayar Khan held power for a short time, but „ow he has been ousted, and the rulers at present in authority, forming a duumvirate, in it Merv country are Baba Khan, the son of Koushid Khan, and Aman Niaz Khan. Besides the ketkhodas, the grey-beards have much , es P®;;! a ! ly J [[ 7 ,^ rich. One of the most influential of the grey-beards is Killitch Mojek, ot the Beg clan Killitch means sword, and Mojek wolf. Mahomad \ usut Khan has a good dea of influence even amongst the Beg clan, through his mother, Jumal Bhai, as she 1 , a woman of an influential family of that clan. , , , Proceeding up the Murghah river after leaving Kala Koushid Khan, at about 45 miles, the Sarnk encampment ofYullatuu is reached; here there are gineia y Ditched some 4,000 tents of the Saruk tribe. The tents are scattered about and the whole is known as Yullatun. Above Yullatun is the band or dam of the Saruk tribe, hut it is not properly finished, and is a poor affair 111 comparison with the Tekeh dam near Allasha. Sirdar Sultan Niaz Nahung is one ot the chief men ot the -aiuk tribe at Yullatun. The largest settlement of the Saruk tribe is five days journey furtiier up the Murghab river at Puug Deh or the five villages. At Pung Deh there are about 7,000 tents of Oils tribe, one of the chief men at Pung Deh is Ahman Khan. The descendants of Kurim Verdi Ishan, a family of priests, have much influence amongst the Saruk 1 uiko- mans, and they are addressed as Kalif Oglu, or sous of the Khalit. Pung Deh is s.tua ed above the junction of the Kushk stream with the Murghab. If, instead ot follow mg the Murghab to Pung Deh, the Kushk stream is followed, the town of Kushk is reached, and this fs the best road to Herat. The distance from Kala Koushid Khan to Herat is about 250 miles bv Kushk, less if the direct road is taken. Ayub Khan has a garrison of his regular Afghan soldiers in Kushk, which is a poor place. It is the capital of the Jamshedis, a tribe very similar to the Turkomans but not considered so brave ; they generally live in tents, and are nomads, though there are houses in Kushk. At present the Jamshedis, are very hostile to Ayub Khan. Ayub Khan marrted a daughter J the chief of the JatUedis who was named Khan Agha, but tn January las he put him to death. The son of Khan Agha, with a large number ol followers, fled to the Sat uk Turkomans, and the Jamsbedi camps were plundered by the troops of Ayub Khan. 4 he Jamshedis, who are a division of the Char Aimak tubes of Herat, would rise if Abdur Rhaman Khan, the Amir of Cabul, appeared before Herat, and the son of Khan Agha would join him with a considerable following of Jamshedts, and some Saruk Turkomans would also join, with the hope ot obtaining plunder. On the western bank of the Murghab river, opposite the fort ot Koushid Khan, are the quarters of the Bukshi and Suchmuz clans of the Tekeh ; these clans it is said, can bring as many warriors into the field as the Beg and Wakil clans, but they have not so much importance politically. They have no one paramount family, andscem o he even more impatient of restraint than the other clans. Amongst the Buksh. tube Aman Niaz Khan is a powerful chief, and a person named Mahomad Durd. Klnm, whom I met in Mash-had, has some influence. In the Suchmuz clan Adnayar Khan Kazak is powerful, and Niaz Mahomad, whom l met tn Mash-had, has some power.I will now proceed to describe the roads from Persia to the Merv country. Foimerly the canals from the Tcjcnd and Murghah ran a long way out, and there was very little desert, but now there is a serious amount of desert to encounter. All canals from the Tejend having fallen into ruin, and the canals from the Murghah not ex tending nearly so far as they used to do. Firstly, I will describe the road from Mahomadabad in Daragez to Kala Kouchid Khan which was given me by Sari Beg. I myself met Sari Beg on the road from Kala, Koushid Khan to Mahomadabad, near Lutfabad, in the Atak country. On this occasion his camels had made the joueney in six marches from the .Merv country to Mahomadabad. This is, however, unusual. Eight marches is the regular number. Horsemen sometimes do it in four when they are carrying letters. Route No. 1. From Lutfabad to Chash Tepe, 20 miles.—No water ; is only a resting place for camels. At Keran, 21 miles.—No water. It is only a halting place. Chungul, 22 miles.—Water in plenty. A large hole filled with water from a branch of the Tejend river. There are tents, and cultivation ; this place is sometimes called Oubah Tejend. The inhabitants are Merv Tekeh ; they generally go away in summer after they have harvested their crops. Yol Airtee, 22 miles.—No water. A mere halting place. Kumi Yap, 21 miles.—Ditto, ditto. Birkuz Chah, 21 miles.—A well of water. No inhabitants. Kara Yurmah, 21 miles.—An inhabited place, chiefly by camel owners of the Tekeh tribe who come here to graze their animals. Water from a canal from the Murghab river. Kala Koushid Khan, 22 miles.—This day’s journey is through a thickly inhabited country. Cross Murghab river. Total, 170 miles. A slightly different road was given to me by Fasheh Khan, the chief man of Askabad, whom I met at Lutfabad at the house of Syd Aly Khan, the governor of the portion of the Atak country which belongs to Persia. Syd Ali Khan is the deputy governor for his brother, the Begler Begi of Daragez, under whom both Daragez and Atak are placed. Fasheh Khan is a relation of Mukdum Kuli Khan, and belongs to the Wakil clan of the Akhal Tekeh tribe. He had come in to pay a visit to Syd Aly Khan when I met him. Route No. 2. Fasheh Khan said, 1 go from Lutfabad to Adana Awaz, 40 miles.- little water from a small branch of the Tejend river, generally dry, fills a hole where water is found. Mahmur, 36 miles.— Water from Tejend and also from a fine well, times of some importance. Birkuz Chah, 42 miles.—Water from a well. Karayab, 22 miles.—Water from canal from Murghab. Kala Koushid Khan, 24 miles. Total, 164 miles from Lutfabad. Fasheh Khan said “ I do not understand about distance, but these are the stages for horsemen.” His account was corroborated by Syd Aly Khan, who had, six months pre viously returned from Kala Koushid Khan by this road. The distances moreover tally very nearly with those given by Sari Beg. Sari Beg, in Route No. I, gives 170 miles as the distance from Lutfabad to Kala Koushid Khan, and Fasheh Khan gives 164 miles from the same place, but by a slightly different road. Turkomans are always vague about distances, and these distances can only be approximate. I asked Sari Beg, “ Why do you not go by Mahmur as other people do ?” He answered, “ I am afraid of my mer- “ chandise being plundered by Akhal Tekeh, as Mahmur is nearer their country, so I 4 ‘ go by Chungul, instead of by Mahmur. I know about Mahmur; it is a place situated “ about 20 miles from Chungul.” He said, “We cross the Murghab near Kala Koushid “ Khan by bridges ordinarily, but sometimes the Murghab is crossed in the spring in “ boats.” I asked Sari Beg if he had ever been from Kala Koushid Khan to Charjui. He said he often had, and that the distance was a little more than that to Lutfabad and that he did the distance in nine marches with his camels, instead of eight which is the usual time to Daragez. He said, “ 1 much prefer the journey to Daragez.” On the 5757 . H -Here there is a which, however, Was in formerroad to Chargui there is much sand and many sand hills. The water is also far apart, and brackish when found. I will here give the roads from Mash-had to Kala Koushid Khan, which I obtained during my stay in Mash-had from a Jew trader and from three different carriers who traded between Mash-had and Kala Koushid Khan. Route No. 3. Mash-had to Kuzkan, 14 miles.—Village marked, in European maps, Ghuskan, but, as it is spelt in Persian with the two-dotted kaf, it must be spelt with k, not^. Karabokah, eight miles.—Village. Char Gumbuz, eight miles. Robat Mahi, nine miles.—Large old caravanserai. Mozdaran, 14 miles.—Persian fort garrisoned by from 50 to 100 men, according to the time, whether peaceful or otherwise. Shurukh, 13 miles.—Cross mountain pass from Mozdaran, spring of brackish water. Haoz or Gumbuzli, 10 miles.—Water in the spring season. Kundukli, 13 miles.—Ditto, ditto. Sarakhs, 10 miles. Total, 99 miles. Sarakhs is a Persian fort held by 400 regular Persian infantry, *20 Shamkalchis or irregular infantry, and 20 irregular cavalry. Besides the above, there are a few artillerymen in the fort who work the six small guns which are kept here. There are 400 inhabitants in the fort besides the garrison. Some 20 families of Turkomans, who have settled here, live outside the fort and cultivate. The Persian inhabitants can only leave the fort or go beyond the reach of their artillery when they are in large numbers, or else with a military escort of considerable strength. The Persian fort of Sarakhs is situated about 1,000 yards from the Tejend or Huri Rud river on its western side. Sarakhs to Kal Haoz, 16 miles.—Cross Tejend river, which, in spring, contains a large body of water close to Sarakhs fort. At Kal Haoz, water collects in a pool after rain and remains for some time, especially in spring time. Haoz-i-Khan or Haoz-i-Abdulla Khan, 32 miles.—Water in spring, at other times dry, but at Shur Kala, a ruined Turkoman village, two or three miles off, water can always be obtained from a brackish spring. Shur Kala was formerly inhabited by Turkomans of the Salor tribe ; now it is deserted. Road hard and good for camels. Kucha Kum or Shaitli, 23 miles.—Road from Haoz-i-Khan has much sand, and near Kucha Kum there are sand hills. Water always found here in shallow wells, about 12 feet deep. Rather brackish. The name of the district about here is Kucha Kum, and refers to the sand. The actual wells are called Shaitli. Dash Robat, i.e., the stone caravanserai, 7 miles.—A fine stone caravanserai built by Abdulla Khan. Th^fe is an inscription in caravanserai. No water. Road improves after leaving Shaitli. Kunju-Kulun, 12 miles.—Road improves as Kunju Kulun is neared. This is a large place. Many tents of Turkomans, and water from a canal from Murghab. Kala Koushid Khan, 10 miles.—Pass through an inhabited country and cross Murghab river near Kala Koushid Khan, by wooden bridge, except sometimes in spring, when boats have to be used. «Bridges both above and below Kala Koushid Khan. Total, 100 miles from Sarakhs. The other road from Mash-had to Kala Koushid Khan is a rather longer one, but is is apparently a preferable one. The distance from Mash-had to Kala Koushid Khan is 199 miles by the first and 213 miles by the second; both these roads are shown upon accompanying map. Route No. 4. Mash-had to Gugki, 20 miles.—Village. Sunduk Shikast, seven miles.—This place is only a spring of water in the hills where the roads to Khaur and Chacha separate. Amirabad, 20 miles.—Road very bad across mountain. Amirabad is a small village. Chacha, 20 miles.—Road from Amirabad fairly good for camels. Water plentiful. Kara Chacha, 19 miles.—Large village of Turkomans who come from Merv country to cultivate, and pay a tenth as revenue to Khan of Khelat Nadiri, in whosegovernment it is situated. Plenty of water from stream. This stream is lost, and does not reach Tejend. Kangali, on banks of Tejend river, 32 miles.—No inhabitants. It is just a resting place for caravans on the bank of the river. The bed of the Tejend is here some 200 yards wide. Camels cannot reach the Tejend in one march from Kara Chacha. They generally halt a few miles short of it. Dashlalung (the stony place), 30 miles.—Merely a stony place where caravans halt for a few hours’ rest for the camels. Sometimes in spring some water is found here, but this is not common. A good hard road. Kucha Kum or Shaitli, 36 miles.—Wells of brackish water. These wells are peiv manent. The road via, Sarakhs joins here. Dash Robat (the stone caravanserai), seven miles.—A fine stone caravanserai in not very bad repair. No water. There is a stone inscription telling who built the caravanserai. Kunju Kulun, 12 miles.—Inhabited place. No houses; people live in tents. Canal from Murghab river. Kala Koushid Khan, 10 miles.—Cross Murghab river by wooden bridges, except in spring, when boats have sometimes to be used. Total, 213 miles. There is another road by Mehna, in the Khelat Nadiri district, but it only differs a little from that by Kara Chacha, and has no water from the time the Tejend is crossed until the Merv country is reached, as it does not pass the wells at Shaitli. I will here mention a place called Artyk Kala. It is of some importance, as it is situated on the direct road from Kara Chacha to Sarakhs. It, like Kara Chacha, is cultivated by Turkomans, who pay one tenth of the produce to the Persian Government as revenue. It belongs to Persia. While I was staying at Lutfabad with Syd Aly Khan, the Begler Begi’s brother, I had much talk with Fasheh Khan about the course of the Tejend river. It seems very curious that so little is known or can be discovered about what becomes of it. When it passes Sarakhs it is still a good sized stream flowing in a wide bed. Much farther down at Kangali, where the caravan road from Kara Chacha crosses the stream, it is said to be 200 yards wide, or as my informant said, it was a gunshot across, meaning a shot from an ordinary Persian rifle. Beyond this point, opposite Mehna, where crossed by Mr. O’Donovan, it was still a considerable river, but soon after this it must divide. Fasheh Khan, the Akbal Tekeh chief from Askabad, says it divides into four small streams, sometimes there is water in one, sometimes in another, sometimes in all four. The nearest of these branches to Lutfabad is the smallest, and rarely has water in it; this is the one that fills the pool at Adna Awaz, the first halting place on the Route No. 2. Beyond this is a second branch of the Tejend, cailed Kizil Jar, beyond this again is a third branch, called Ketchelli. The fourth or furthest branch of the Tejend passes near Mahmur. In this branch there is almost always water. The other branches are often dry. In spring and early summer there is plenty of water in the Tejend. At Mahmur there is a fine well besides the water which comes from the Tejend. On the branch of the Tejend passing near Chungul there are large pools of water and great reeds. The Turkomans leave this neighbourhood in summer, as their cattle are much troubled by the heat and insects. The branch of the Tejend which passes Adana Awaz is lost in the Kara Kum desert, near a place called Ker-Kui. From Askabad to Ker-Kui it takes 2+ hours of riding. The country where the river ends is very heavy sand, and would be quite impassable to guns. The part of the country where this branch ends is known as Minara, from a ruined minar or pillar which used to be there. The Kizil Jar branch of the Tejend river ends at a place called Palwanthi, in the Kara Kum desert, to the eastward of the Adna Awaz branch. The Ketchelli branch ends at a place called Musa, still more to the eastward. The Mahmur branch goes past a place called Togul to Khurgojaz, where it finishes in the Kara Kum desert. There is very heavy sand where these streams cease, but no marshes. Although a horseman can go in 24 hours from Askabad to the point where the most western branch of the Tejend ends, it would take him much longer to reach the point where the most eastern branch ends.* • All the Turkomans I spoke to said they knew of no large marsh where the Tejend ends, but that it is finally lost in the sand of the desert. However, the Russiaus in their latest map, published in 1881, show a marsh. There is some small amount of water and large reeds near Chungul, but this is far away from the swamp shown on the Russian map. I was much puzzled by this, as the Russians should know, as they were closer to the marsh, if it exists, than I was.Before leaving the subject of the Turkomans I will devote a short space to the Eyrsari Turkomans. They live on the left bank of the Oxus, and are more or less subject to the Amir of Bokhara^ who has much influence with them. They are said to number 100,000 tents. 1 had much talk with an Eyrsari Turkoman at Mahomad- abad, and from inquiries made from him and other people I cannot estimate their numbers at less than 75,000 tents. During the siege of Yangi Shahr by the Russians, they sent a deputation to Kala Koushid Khan to offer a contingent to assist in the defence of Yangi Shahr. The Tekeh, however, declined their assistance. If Kala Koushid Khan were attacked there is no doubt that they would render material aid to the Merv Tekeh. The Akhal Tekeh country is too far off for them to be much affected by its capture by Russia, but it would be different with the Merv country. The chief use the Eyrsari would be in the defence of the Merv country, is that they would prevent a Russian army from the side of the Oxus, near Charjui, operating to assist the Russian army advancing from the Tejend. This road is nine very long marches, the sand hills are described as very difficult even for camels to cross, and the water, which is brackish when found, is at very long intervals. If to this we add a number of hostile Eyrsari Turkomans, I think that road may be considered as out of the question for the advance of an army. The Eyrsari are divided into many small clans, of which I only took down a few names. Sukkur settled near Charjui, Kopekli ditto, and the Khatab near Kerki, on the Oxus. The road from Khiva to Kala Koushid Khan, 350 miles, generally done by camels in 14 marches, is, though longer and also across a desert, not so difficult as the road to Charjui. This road is, however, also a terrible one for an army to attempt. CHAPTER VII. Seige of Geok Tepe by the Russians. I will now more particularly describe the Akhal Tekeh country, and the proceedings of the Russians while besieging Yangi Shahr, or Geok Tepe as they called the place. Geok Tepe is a small village near Yangi Shahr. Yangi Shahr was a fortification similar in construction to Kala Koushid Khan (but not as formidable), and it had not a river as a wet ditch as the latter has. The chief Russain road, in the earlier period of the campaign against the Akhal Tekeh, Jed from Chickishliar, on the Caspian, following pretty nearly the course of the Atrak to Chat-i-Atrak. Chat means meeting, and is where the Sumbar river meets the Atrak. From thence the Russian road follows the Sumbar until the second chat, or Chat-i-Cbandir, is reached, where the Chandir river meets the Sumbar. At this point the Russians built a fort called Duslolum. From Chat-i-Atrak until the range of hills near Bami is crossed, the whole road leads through Persian territory. As this country is very sparsely inhabited, and is not of much value to Persia, no objection was made to the use of it by the Russians. It was of great importance to R ussia, in the earlier part of the campaign, to use this road, as water was found along it, while the direct road from Michailof, on the Caspian, to Kizil Arvat was over a desert where water was scarce and bad. During the latter part of the campaign the direct road was used. The road vid Chat and Duslolum was kept up, though not much used latterly because it was useful for bringing supplies from Bujnurd and Sabzawar, in Persia, vid Duslolum to Bami and Beaurma. A railway has been constructed for some 64 miles from Michailof towards Kizil Arvat. A horse tramway has also been made over the greater part of the line from Michailof to Kizil Arvat, where the railway had not been completed. Great quantities of provisions were collected at Bami and Beurma by General Skobeleff, previous to his advance on Yangi Shahr. Early in December last, the Russian troops appeared at Kariz Yuganah Batir, about seven miles from Yangi Shahr, and trenches were opened before Yangi Shabr on the 2nd January 1881, according to the Turkoman account. I will not here give a detailed history of the siege of Yangi Shahr. Firstly, because I have already written of it in previous letters sent from Mash-had, and, secondly, the subject of the siege is no longer of interest. The Turkomans on two occasions captured guns from the Russians, also many rifles and much ammuni tion. They actually in one attack possessed themselves of the trenches, driving the Russians out of the greater part of them, but finally, on the *24th January, the Russians captured Yangi Shahr. Their position before Yangi Shahr about the 15th January was a very critical one indeed; they could not get up supplies enough from theirIll m 33 base at Bami and Beunna, seven marches away, to feed their men, as the Turkoman Horsemen made communication along the line most difficult. T. he Persian Governor of Bujnurd and FCuchan forwarded provisions at the urgent request of t,eneral Skobeleff, and these provisions, not being liable to attack while passing through Persian territory, were brought up close to the Russian camp by the Persian authorities, and only had to be conveyed over a narrow strip of country by the Russians to their camp. ^ J J „/// ap '! C , 0 , f ^ P^isions rose in the camp to almost famine prices, and the resistance of the Akhal T^keh was most obstinate. The Russian loss, I believe, exceeded 1 400 men according to their own officers, though a smaller loss, I understand, was stated in tie official despatches If the Russians had been commanded by a less able general than General Skobeleff they would probably have retired. The Turkomans allow 4,000 men on their side were killed. A very large number of women were captured by the Russians in the town. Most of the men escaped. The Russian columns pursued the flying Turkomans almost to the Tejend river, and General Skobeleff entered 1 ersian territory and occupied the the small Persian town of Luttabad, where I had been staying with the Persian Deputy Governor, Syd Aly A Russian force advanced through Persian territory for many miles, and also occupied Kahka, where they remained in considerable numbers up to the time of mv leaving Persia. J 1 have lately reemved letters informing me that the Russians have retired across the Persian frontier. Their advanced post at this moment is at Gawars, about 25 miles in advance of Askabad, and not far from Lutfahad. Reconnaisances were pushed beyond Kahka, and it is said reached the Tejend river, though no force was stationed beyond Kahka. The Russian garrison at Kahka consisted of 1,000 men. Kahka is well fitted for an advanced post. It is situated in the Khelat Nadiri district of Persia, and being near the Tejend is a good point from which to organize an advance either on the Merv country or on Herat. A Russian force in the Khelat Nadiri district of Persia very seriously threatens Herat, in fact the advance from Kahka to Herat is much easier than an advance on the Merv country. The distance from Kahka to Herat, in a direct line, is exactly 250 miles. There are no physical difficulties whatever to be encountered, no deserts of any sort to cross, as there are between * Kahka and Kala Koushid Khan. Herat is situated not far from the banks of the Hun Rud river, the same river which is called Tejend by the Turkomans From Kahka a good road leads by Mehna and Kara Chacha to Sarakhs on the Huri Rud river. If it was thought necessary to avoid Persian territory, the march of an army could be conducted along the further bank of the Huri Rud river, the river itself bein«- struck at a point lower down than Sarakhs, but the Rusians have never scrupled to make use of Persian soil for their operations, and have hitherto been much helped by the Persian Governors along the border of whose provinces their road has passed It is openly said in Persia by the people that Sarakhs fort would be surrendered on the appearance of a Russian force before it. This could be done by a friendly arrange ment with the Shah, which has probably been already made. Every assistance is bemg given to the Russian advance by the Persian authorities, even when a Persian town like Lutfabad is actually entered by Russian troops. The Governor of Bujnurd was rewarded by the Shah (at the moment that he was pushing forward provisions to Yan°i Shahr or Geok Tepe,) with a title and dress of honour. The Prince Governor of Mash-had, the Shah’s own brother, while l was in Mash-had, ordered 2,000 camels, the owners of which had been hired by the Russian consular agent. Kurrim Beg, but who made some difficulty about proceeding to the Russian camp, to start at once, thus using his authority to force camels to be furnished to the Russians. The bed of the Tejend would furnish plenty of good water and grass and wood to the Russian troops on their advance, and provisions would be procured in almost unlimited quantities in the rich Persian province of Khorasan. Camels are also very plentiful in Khorasan, and could be furnished in large numbers by the Persian authorities. From Sarakhs alon^ the bed of the Huri Rud there are no physical difficulties to the advance of an army oa Herat.^ The whole difficulty of the enterprise was in the country near the Caspian Sea. The railway now in course of construction from Michailof on the Caspian to Bami, which is the capital of the new trans-Caspian province, is completed for about 64 miles. Beyond that point there is a horse tramway for the conveyance of materials and every effort was being made, when I was in Baku, on the Caspian, in April last! for the completion of this line as far as Bami without delay. The continuation 5757. this34 railway from Rami to Askabad is projected. The country between Michailof and Kizzil Arvat is desert, hat there are do serious difficulties in making a railway over it. There are sandy pieces, hut a great portion of the desert is hard clay, and over this a railway is very easily made. Deserts are difficult to traverse with camels, travelling miles per hour, but present few difficulties to the laying of railways, as provisions and water can he carried along the line as it is laid, and when once Kizzn Arvat is reached there is no desert between that point and the Tejend river. CHAPTER VIII. Description of Daragez. From the 25th November to the 27th December 1880 I stayed in Mahomadabad -collecting information, and buying a few horses and carpets to keep up my character. I often visited the Begler Begi, or Governor of Daragez, who was most civil, probably in consequence of the presents 1 made him. I also lent him a small sum ot money. He did not suspect me to be anything hut a well-to-do merchant ot Calcutta. Mr O’Donovan the “ Daily News ” correspondent, who was living in Mahomadabad, did not suspect me, though T saw him frequently. At the end of a month l told him who 1 was, and showed him my passport. He was very much surprised to discover that I was an Englishman. Mr. O’Donovan; though treated with all respect, had always a guard over him, and was not permitted to go about without it. It was stated that the guard was to do him honour and protect him, but they had orders not to let him communicate with any Turkomans, and he, as an Englishman tound it most difficult to get any information, while I was permitted to wander about and sneak to any one 1 liked without let or hindrance. Mr. O’Donovan made an effort to escape into the Akhal Tekeh country, but was brought hack a prisoner by the 1 ersian cavalry belonging to the Governor. ^ . . . On the 26th December I heard that the Begler Begi was going on an excursion in the direction of Askabad, to a group of villages known as Kalta Chmar, and I asked permission to accompany him. He gave me leave to do so, and I rode out with him on the 28th December. He had an escort of 50 cavalry. We proceeded to the village of Nakundan, some nine miles from Mahomadabad. # r Nakundan is a flourishing small town of some 2,000 inhabitants, where a brothei o the Beeler Be^i, called Surruk Khan, resides. I was given a comfortable room m the village, and was well treated. On the 29th the Begler Begi rode out to visit a holv shrine, a few miles in advance, and I went on in the Askabad direction to a village called Julfan, which is said to have been formerly a Christian village. I rode out until 1 was near the village of Tojanlu, some 14 miles from Mahomadabad, and then returned towards Nakundan. Near Julfan I visited a mound which is known as Tene KalEsa or the church mound. Tradition declares that formerly a Christian church was here situated, and that it and the Christian village of Julfan were de stroyed by Jenghiz Khan in the 13th century. There were Christian bishops of the Nestorian church at Tus and Merv in Khorasan previous to the Mahomadan invasion in A D 666 but I should doubt there having been Christians here so late as the 13th century. However, all destruction is attributed to Jenghiz Khan, and the ruins of villages to be seen in this place in all directions are said to have been his handi work. °The present inhabitants are Kurds, who say they were brought here by ^hah Abbas to repeople the land, and know nothing beyond the tradition that this was a Christian village, and that a Christian church existed on the mound still known as Tene Kalissa. The Christian suburb of Isfahan is called Julfa. The Armenian Christian town near the Araxes is also called Julfa. It is curious that this village, said to have been Christian, should be known as Julfan. We have no positive know ledge when Christianity ceased to exist in these regions where once a considerable Christian population existed. r *-i i * The country passed over between Mahomadabad and 1 ojamu is very fertile, nit covered with refuge towers, showing how dreadfully the whole country is harned with Turkomans. Almost every fifth person one speaks to has at some period or other been carried off and either sold as a slave or ransomed. I met many slaves who had, alter years in Khiva, been released by the Russians. All these men were loud m their praises of the great and merciful Russian Government, and the prestige of Russia has been enormously increased by the release of the Persian slaves. 1 he slaves ave met here declare that 40,000 were released, that 10,000, who tried to return throughthe Turkoman country, were all killed, but that the rest actually reached home. A large number were taken by the Russians across the Caspian, and sent home through the Caucasian provinces of Russia. This was not only merciful but a good stroke of policy, as it showed them something of Russian power. I do not know the numbers actually released, but 40,000 is the number usually stated. This is probably an exaggeration. 1 have met. these released slaves in all parts of Khorasan, and some are to be found everywhere in Persia. So far from being averse to the idea of being Russian subjects, I can safely state that the majority of people in this part of the country would be much pleased to become Russian subjects. Of course the governing classes and the Mahomadan priests object to the idea, but all other people would like it. Persians are really very doubtful Mahomedans, and, beyond the outward observ ance of their religion, care very little for it. •The Kajar dynasty, who now rule Persia, is very unpopular in Khorasan. It was the last province of Persia to fall under the Kajar rule, and they have always treated Khorasan as a conquered province. Everywhere the people said, “We are squeezed of every penny that can be screwed out of us to fill the Kajar treasury. w No doubt this is true, but I do not know any other Persian family who would rule Persia even as well as the Kajars, and I look upon Nasur-ud-Din Shah as a very good specimen of an Oriental sovereign. There are dreadful abuses in Persia, and matters, according to western ideas, are in a bad way, but, after a careful study of the circumstances and reading Persian history, I have come to the conclusion that Persia, badly governed as it certainly is, is better ruled at this moment than it has ever previously been. It was curious to meet here Mahomadans who would welcome the Russian rule, while in Christian Armenia, through which country I had passed on my way to Persia, the case was quite different. There the cry of every one was, “We are dreadfully oppressed by the Turks and Kurds, but better that than Russian rule. The cause of this is that the Armenians have a strong feeling of nationality, and long to be a people, and they feel that, once absoibed into Russia, all hopes of being a nation would be gone. Also, they know much about the Russian rule in Georgia, through constantly crossing the frontier into that country, and they fear the conscription. The Persians know nothing of the conscription, and only se€‘^ the comparative order and personal safety established in Khiva by tlje Russians. They also like the Russians for con quering the Turkomans, whom they naturally look upon as their enemies. No doubt great good has been done by Russia in Khiva, Bokhara, and the Central Asian Khanates, and now the new trans-Caspian province, though not a rich country, will flourish, as a Persian population will soon flow in. The Russian Government, though, according to European standards, a very corrupt one, is an immeasurable improvement on the very best Asiatic Government. The cruelties exercised on the slaves while in transit to their destination is very great. The women, I am told, who may have been born in a proud family, and have never let any one look upon their faces, are stripped naked by the I urkoroans, to examine theii points, just as a horse would he examined, and sold lor the host price that can be obtained for them. It is not wonderful that people who have suffered such wrongs are pleased to see the success of the Russian arms. The country near here is watered by canals, from a stream called Durungar, which comes from the neighbourhood of Kalta Chinar. I met the Begier Begi at a iiiincd mosque, some miles to the westward of the road. He told me had received news of 6 000 Tekeh and Saruk Turkomans, with ten guns, being on their w ay from the Merv country to Yangi Shahr or Geok Tcpe, to assist the Akhal Tekeh against the Russians, and that he was afraid that on the way (as they would skirt the edge of the Atak country beyond Lutfabad) they might plunder some of his border villages. He had sent urgent orders to all his cavalry to assemble at Mahomadabad to-morrow morning, and that he must return at once to Mahomadabad. We returned by a different road from that by which we came. _ On the 30th, some 400 cavalry having assembled, we started tor Luttabad, the chief place of the Atak country, which belongs to Persia, and forms a portion of Daragez. Daragez, though be) ond the mountains, has many small ranges of hills crossing it. The Atak is a part of the great plain which stretches away to the Oxus river. A strip of this Atak country, which is here rich and well watered by the small streams which pour down from the tlazar Musjid range of mountains, belongs to Persia, and this part of the plain was where we were bound to to-day. As we might meet some Turkomans at any moment, every precaution was taken, an advance guard was sent out, mounted scouts scoured the low hills on both flanks. About half way the Begier Begi inspected his cavalry, and made some of the men race their horses, giving prizes to the winners.■'Vt^JPGWI 1 ‘'?5S?T^^i^!f5®S^255i^5 '• &gt;*‘^A'x '. . -v ' j .*. *v• * •■ -. : '-n-Vv. : ~ ~'' V. . - ' . ■ \ . -- .' .-o-L'.

After these were passed we got out into the plain, and went past the villages of Khyrabad and Mir. At Mir the Deputy Governor of Lutfabad, Syd Aly Khan, the Begler Begi’s brother, met us, escorted by a party of some 20 cavalry. We afterwards went by the small village of Mianabad to Lutfabad. Lutfabad is a very small town, with a small bazar, and contains about 1,800 or 2,000 inhabitants. It is fertile, and grape vines and fruit trees were abundant, also wheat is largely cultivated. It is dreadfully exposed to attack from Turkomans, and people are constantly carried off from the very gates of the town. A horse of Syd Aly Khan’s was actually stolen from within the fort only a short time previous to our arrival. So many Turkomans are always going in and out of the town and lounging about the place that great opportunities occur for Turkomans to snap up a man or a horse, and carry him or it off. The town of Lutfabad is sometimes called Babajik. Strictly speaking, Lutfabad is the name of the town, and Babajik of the piece of country or parish, so to say, where it is situated. I stayed with Syd Aly Khan, the Deputy Governor, who was most civil to me. I presented him with a good Enfield rifle, and some English gunpowder, and he gave me two small Turkoman carpets in return. I was much interested in his account of a visit he had paid to Kala Koushid Khan, some eight months previous to my meeting him. He said that he had been sent by the Persian Government to, negotiate with the Turkomans. He gave a very clear description of his journey, and of the country passed over, but was very reticent about the negotiations on which he had been employed, but subsequently I met a Turkoman chief of the Bukshi clan at Mash-had, from whom I heard a full account of the negotiations that had taken place, and I will enter into that subject in its proper place. Mr. O’Donovan, the correspon dent of the “ Daily News,” accompanied the Begler Begi on this visit to the Atak country, though he did not accompany him on the excursion to Julfan and Nakundan. In the evening a number of Turkoman chiefs came in, amongst whom was Fasheh Khan, an Akhal Tekeh chief, of Askabad, who evidently was not a friend of Mukdum Kuli Khan’s, though he was his relative. The next day the Begler Begi had horse races, and gave many prizes to the winners. Some very handsome horses from Merv were shown, and I examined a good many horses w ith a view to purchase. A very handsome black horse was the one I Jiked best. It belonged to a petty chief of the Alehli tribe of Turkomans, who are settled near Andkho, on the Afghan border, towards Balkh, but many have within the last few years settled about Abiverd, and this man belonged to that section. The Begler Begi was much vexed at the town of Abiverd having been taken from him, and made over to the Governor of Khelat Nadiri. He felt this the more keenly because Abiverd was the home of his ancestors, and the place from w hich they had sprung. He told me that his great great grandfather had led the Turks of Abiverd in all the battles of Nadir Shah, and that his great grandfather had been killed by a Turkoman arrow. He declares that up to 40 years ago the Turkomans had no fire-arms, or hardly any, and trusted entirely in their spears. The charge of the Turkoman horse, which hardly any Asiatics have been able to resist, was what made them most formidable. However, within the last ten years, since the Turkomans have so largely supplied themselves with breech-loading rifles from the Russians, their tactics have undergone a con. siderable change. It is now the Turkoman infantry which is to be feared. The Persian cavalry cannot meet the Turkoman infantry armed with breech-loaders, or else with a good muzzle-loading rifle of very large bore called a “ shamkal,” made* in the Merv country and Bokhara. I was assured that the Turkomans in Yangi Shahr had 3,500 Berdan rifles, which they had captured from the Russians. Many of these rifles w ere brought in for sale to Mahomadabad, and the Begler Begi purchased a few. Some breech-loading revolver pistols were also brought in for .sale. These were of the pattern worn by Russian officers, but the price asked was so high that the Begler Begi did not purchase any. I did not myself see the pistols, but I did see some of the rifles. The Begler Begi is very anxious about the 6,000 Turkomans who are said to be at Chungul, on the Tejend river, on their way to Yangi Shahr with 10 guns. They will pass through Gawars on their road, and he very much fears an attack on Kuren or some of the villages near Lutfabad. There are* supposed to be 500 cavalry here. Every mounted man in the Daragez country has assembled, and there are really between 400 and 500 cavalry. The men are, as a rule, well mounted on Turkoman horses, they are dressed in their ordinary clothes and are badly armed. About 20have breech-loading: rifles (Chassepots), the rest have every imaginable description of weapon, and it anything like 0,000 Turkomans make an attack our chance of success would indeed be bad. Turkomans seldom attack a fortified place that is held in any force, so the Begler Begi is safe inside the fort at Lutfabad, but he does not dare to move about the country freely until he hears of the departure of this body of Turko mans who are threatening his frontier. The history of the guns in the possession of the Turkomans is as follows :—32 guns were taken from Hamza Mirza Hashmat-ud- Dowlah when his army was destroyed or captured near the Murghab in 1860. A few guns were taken from the Khan of Khiva, in 1855, when that individual was killed and his head sent as a present to the Shah by the Tekeh Turkomans. All these guns are in the Merv country. The Akhal Tekeh have also one gun which they captured from the Persians in Yangi Shahr, and, I believe, sometimes actually use it. The carriages of all these guns have rotted, and when used they are fired from a heap of mud. These guns are, of course, of no use whatever, but all Turko mans have the most wonderful opinion of the power of artillery, and treasure up these old guns. Cast-iron pots are collected and shot made from them. Many shot also are hammered, 1 believe, into a roundish form for these guns. It is a curious circumstance that no Jew trader will visit the Akhal Tekeh country. The Turkoman theory about slaves is, that it is lawful to sell as slaves all infidels, and Mahomadans of the Shiah sect are held as infidels by the Turkomans. However’ this is only a theory, and I believe that if a descendant of the Khalif Omar, whom they particularly revere, was to fall into their hands they would sell him as readily as any one else. It is said that in former times Jews were not sold, but this is certainly not the case now. I myself know of a case of two Jews who attempted to pass through the Akhal Tekeh country, from Khiva to Daragez, and who were carried off, kept as slaves, and not released until a ransom of 360T was paid. The contemptuous immunity of Jews from being sold as slaves, if it ever existed, has long since passed away. The Jews about Kala Koushid Khan make arrangements to accompany a powerful protector to whom they pay a sum of money. Any person, even Persian Shiahs, visit the Merv country in this way. Mr. O’Donovan, the “Daily News” correspondent, left Daragez for the Akhaf Tekeh country after many difficulties; though orders were sent to the Governor of Daragez by the Persian Government to permit him to visit the Akhal Tekeh country, he was not permitted to cross the frontier until the Russians were known to be in possession of the whole Akhal Tekeh country, when, of course, he could not cross. No doubt, while public orders were issued to allow him to pass, private orders were sent to prevent his doing so. I strongly advised him not to visit the Akhal Tekeh country, as I believed it would certainly lead to his being killed, but I told him that after making proper arrangements he might, I considered, safely visit the Merv country. He started for the Merv country soon after I returned from Daragez to Mash-had, but I understand he had made no arrangements whatever, and simply trusted himself to a guide and the people. He has been detained as a prisoner in the Merv country, and I fear will not be released without a ransom of considerable amount being paid. It was, I think, very unwise to trust himself to the Turkomans without placing himself definitely under the protection of some powerful chief. Mr. O’Donovan only knew the Turki language imperfectly when he started, but no doubt can now speak it. His information when he returns will be most valuable. I consider him safe where he is, but I fear there will be con siderable-difficulty in obtaining his release. While I was at Mahomadabad the Begler Begi showed me a letter he had received from a Russian prisoner, called Kidayeff, who is in the hands of the Turkomans. He has been their prisoner for eight years, and was captured near Khiva. Four thousand tomans, or about 1,480/., was demanded for bis release. Now, however, I believe one thousand tomans, or about 370/., would gladly be accepted for him. I persuaded the Begler Begi to send him a sheepskin coat and a pair of shoes, which he begged might be sent to him. Through Sari Beg, a merchant of the Suchmuz clan, I forwarded him three tomans, or 30 francs; 1 would have sent more, but I was informed if I sent a larger sum it would probably be kept by his master, whose cupidity would be aroused. I was told that Kidayeff was well treated, being given tea every day, which is con sidered a luxury by the Turkomans, that he had an alajak to himself, and was only chained up at night, being allowed his freedom by day. 1 he Governor at last received information that the Turkomans had passed on to Gawars, and did not intend to plunder any part of the Atak country. He was much relieved and became quite gay, and proposed that we should ride along the edge of the Atak country and visit some of the villages inhabited by Turkomans, but who 5757. knav revenue to Persia. We rode out the next morning with an escort of some 250 cavalry in the direction of Abiverd. The country passed over was rich and well watered • in fact, too well watered, for a good deal of it was swamp. In every direction great mounds and ruins of villages were to be seen. The largest mound is called Khosru Purwez, from the Sassanian king who was a contemporary of Mahomad Houses were still to he seen on the summit. The people said it had been inhabited as late as 15 years ago, but it is now in ruins. Many villages have within the last 10 or 15 years been harried by the Turkomans, and their inhabitants carried off m such numbers that the people have deserted them. The present Governor, who is friendlv as a rule with Turkomans, has succeeded in getting Turkomans to occupy these villages and to pay revenue to the Persian Government. We rode over some very swampv ground, and had a good deal of difficulty in getting our horses over it. We* passed a pl^ce where a battle had been fought between the Daragez cavalry and the Turkomans two years and a half ago. # , lA , Dowlut Murad Khan, a cousin of the present Begler Begi, who had revolted against the late Governor of Daragez and seized Mahomadabad, was driven away by a large Persian force under the Shah’s brother, Rukun-ud-Dowlah, the Governor General of Khorasan. Rukun-ud-Dowlah, however, was not satisfied with the conduct of the Governor of Daragez, an elder brother of the present man, and sent him a prisoner to Teheran The present ruler was installed in his place and given the title of Begler Begi by the Shah, a payment of 6,000 tomans, or about 2,200/., being made to Rukun-ud- Dowlah bv the new Governor for his appointment. No sooner had the Persian army under the* Prince Governor of Khorasan retired from Daragez, than Dawlut Murad Khan the cousin, who had once before seized Mahomadabad, appeared on the scene again at the head of 800 Tekeh horsemen. The Begler Begi attacked him with 700 cavalry near Lutfabad, and after some desultory skirmishing the Turkomans fled. 1 saw some of the prisoners thus captured still unransomed at Mahomadabad. Dowlut Murad Khan himself escaped, but two of his brothers were taken and stoned to death by the Begler Begi’s orders. The, heads of the slain were collected and skinned. The skins of the heads were forwarded to the Shah, who paid five tomans, or 1/. 17s:, each for them. A dress of honour and a handsome standard were sent by the Shah to the Begler Begi as a mark of approval of his conduct. This cutting off the heads of their enemies after a battle is a horrid custom. . . The road lay over a most fertile country, though a great deal is uncultivated, as it is almost impossible for the people, though refuge towers are numerous, to escape capture by Turkomans. It was covered with a small thorny bush, called in India « jowasa.” In this, pheasants were numerous and we flushed several. One of these was ridden dowm by a small party of horsemen. After the third flight it allowed itself to be picked up bv hand. It was an ordinary pheasant, quite similar to the English pheasant, except it had a white patch on each wing. Great numbers of pheasants are ridden down in this way, the Begler Begi assuring me that 100 was not an uncommon number to be captured in one day. To-day, however, we were anxious to get over the ground, so went on at a good rate, and did not delay to capture pheasants. We went bv a village called Hissar, inhabited by Turkomans, and entered the village of Mukdum, Here the'people were living in “alajaks,” or Turkoman tents, amidst the ruins ot the Persian village. The whole of the cattle from this village of Mukdum had been carried off about three weeks previously by Turkomans. The Tekeh who have occupied these villages are safe from being carried off as slaves, as Persians would be, but their cattle are not safe. 1 am told that this living amongst the ruins in tents is exactly what happens in every village or town occupied by Turkomans, they never repair the houses. Askabad is said to be in a similar state. Some of the tents were the regular felt alajaks, and some were tents made of thick grass mats, not nearly so comfortable. I hear many of the dwellings in the Merv country and on the Fejend, where reeds are plentiful, are made of reeds and grass mats. The Turkomans were most civil, and a handsome carpet was spread for me to sit upon. I, however, alter ' a short time left the tents and went to lunch with the Begler Begi, who had lunch, consisting of pilaf of rice and mutton and very good melons, on a carpet in the open air. , , . .- T ^ u ir 1 could not see Abiverd from here, though I was told I should see it if I went halt a mile further. The Begler Begi, however, declared that we must return at once. I was pointed out where Abiverd was, and took the bearings ot the spot indicated. Abiverd is now a town of the Khelat Nadiri district. It has lost its former importance since the seat of government of Daragez, which was formerly at Abiverd, has been transferred to Mahomadabad.Some confusion has arisen about Abiverd. The old Persian town of Abiyerd is still inhabited, but a great deal of it is in ruins. A small village inhabited by Turkomans, and also called Ahiverd, is a few miles to the rear. I also took the bearings to Khelat Nadiri, the hill of Khelat Nadiri being visible in the distance. Many traditions are current about the great battle that was fought not very far from here between Kai Kaos and Afrasiab in the very earliest ages of Persian history. Near Mukdum is another large Turkoman village called Kussowlie. We returned by another road, passing by Mehni, which is also a I urkoman village, to Chilian. Chilian is a charming place, with plenty of trees and numbers^ of pheasants, though the village, which is contained in a fort, is wretched enough. We got back to Lutfabad about sunset The Begler Begi was very anxious to get in before dark. A Russian force arrived in Lutfabad in February, accompanied by General Seobeleff himself, and Russian troops were pushed on beyond Abiverd to Kahka. We left Lutfabac), and returned to xVlahomadabad on the 3rd January by a different road to that by which we came, the Begler Begi being in a joyous frame ot mind at the idea of having got rid of the large body of Turkomans who had been threatening his country. # A small party of Persian cavalry, who had been raiding near Annau, returned this day with four captives, some camels, and the head of a 1 urkoman, having had one of their own men killed in a fight. On our return to Mahomadabad I went to visit the prison where the Turkoman prisoners are kept. There were about 14 captives. Each man had a heavy iron collar about his neck, and a band of iron round each ancle. A. long chain depended from the neck, and separate chains were fastened to the, leg irons. The chain round the neck could be fastened to a tent peg, or held in the hand of the captor. This is the way that slaves are chained by the Turkomans. Some of these Turkomans had been here for more than two years, but the majority were recent captures. I accompanied Mr. CTDonovan, who wished me to act as interpreter for him. We found one of the recent captures had a bullet in his thigh, and, while we were speaking to him and giving him some money, we were distressed to find that the head of a Turkoman, which had been brought in, was being skinned. The poor wounded wretch evidently thought it would be his turn next, and was much frightened. However, a live Turkoman is worth from 30 to 100 tomans, or from 1U. to 37/., for ransom, while a dead Turkoman will only fetch 1/ 17s., which the Shah pays for the skin of his head. I was very disgusted at this proceeding, and sent a message to the Begler Begi that he had often said he wanted to give me a present, would” he give me the wounded Turkoman prisoner. He sent to say that he had already been offered a splendid Turkoman horse, worth 100 tomans, or 37/., for the wounded man by his relatives, and that he was sorry he could not give him to me, but that l might have any other Turkoman prisoner I liked. I answered that I only wanted the wounded one, and that, as he was about to be freed by his friends, I did not wish to interfere further in the matter. The wounded man was released and taken away by his friends. The prisoners, beyond being heavily ironed, are not ill treated. They are fairly well fed, and are sometimes allowed to go out for a walk with an attendant, of course all chance of running away is prevented by the heavy . chains The skins of the Turkoman’s heads are sent to the Shah to show that his frontier cavalry are doing their duty and killing raiding Turkomans, and the price is sent as a reward to the soldiers for slaying marauders. The Persian cavalry are constantly employed in raiding in the Turkoman country. The Begler Begi assured me that a very large part of his income was derived from the camels, horses, and sheep captured by his cavalry, and from the ransom derived from captured Turko mans. Just after I left Daragez he sent a large party of 60 horsemen to raid near Annau. These men fell into an ambuscade, and 30 of them were killed or captured. In the course of a year much larger numbers of men, women, and animals are carried off by the Turkomans than are carried off by the Persians, but everything captured from them is a perquisite of the Khans, while the loss ot cattle carried off by the Turkomans falls on his subject and not on himself. Persians do not make excursions expressly to capture Turkomans as they do not keep any slaves, except a veiy tew African slaves, but any prisoners that may fall into their hands, in the course of seizing cattle and property, are held to ransom.CHAPTER IX. Persian Troops in Dakagez. The Persian troops in Daragez, who consist of 500 cavalry, are not paid in money. Each man is furnished by the Governor with a horse, arms, and ammunition. He receives a piece of rent-free land, generally as much as can be ploughed by a pair of bullocks, or else a piece of garden land instead of pay. Sometimes, but not always, besides this land, he receives some barley and chaff for the horse’s food. He must be ready at a moment’s notice to turn out to repel a Turkoman attack or to raid for the Begler Begi’s benefit into the Turkoman country. He receives five tomans, or 11. 17s., for each head of a dead Turkoman, and 10 tomans, or 3/. 14s., for a live Turkoman. All plunder must be made over to the Begler Begi. A man who had been in the service, but had left, said, “ I was sent out to plunder for the Begler Begi, but our party “ was attacked by a superior force of Turkomans, and I was badly wounded and “ carried off to Annau. A message was sent to my father to say if 30 tomans, or 11/., “ was not paid at once my head would be cut off. My father took the money and “ ransomed me. The Begler Begi, who had sent me to plunder for him, utterly de- “ dined to pay any part of the ransom. I did not see the advantage of this “ sort of service, so 1 left it.” The Begler Begi collects the revenue of Daragez for the Persian Government, but he is allowed to spend it in keeping up 400 cavalry, who are to be always ready for the Shah’s service. He really does more, for he keeps up 500 cavalry, and his brother, the former Governor, kept up 1,000. He has also to pay an uncertain sum annually as a present to the Governor General at Mash-had. Last year he paid 6,000 tomans, or 2,200/., but that is a much larger amount than usual, as it was his first year. He, I understand, expects to get off much easier this year, or with about 4,000 tomans. Frequently half a battalion of regular troops are stationed in Mahomadabad, and sometimes two or more, but at present there are only the cavalry. I cannot say very much for them, except that they are pretty well mounted. Daragez may be described as a sort of military colony of Persia. The Turks and Kurds who form the mass of the population were brought over here from Azarbejan and Kurdistan by various kings of Persia, and settled here on condition that they defended the frontier against Turkomans. The Begler Begi is their feudal chief. Kuchan, the neighbouring Persian Government, is held very nearly on the same terms, but Kuchan being very rich, the Governor is not allowed to keep the whole of the revenue lor the payment of the troops, 400 cavalry, which he has to keep up, but makes over a certain amount of wheat to the Persian treasury, l believe 1,000 karwars of wheat. A karwar is 750 lbs. Before I left Mash-had, I heard that a large Increase was to be made to the sum paid by the Governor of Kuchan, and that the Begler Begi of Daragez would not be permitted to keep the whole of the revenue col lected by him, as it was known that the sum collected for the Government was far in excess of the amount expended by him for the maintenance of the cavalry. News of the siege of Yangi Shahr, as the Turkomans call the fortress—Geok Tepe, as the Russians call it, from a neighbouring village which bears that name—continually arrived, and I saw at last that the place would probably be taken. I believed it must fall, and, in that case, the Russians would probably enter a portion of the province of Daragez, as the easiest road to the Tejend river passes through Lutfabad. I felt that my presence here after their arrival wonld be undesirable, so 1 determined to return to Mash-had. Before doing so, I will describe Mahomadabad, where I had so long resided. It is a town of 5,000 inhabitants, surrounded by a high wall kept in very fair repair. Besides the original town, there is an outwork beyond the old walls. This new portion is also surrounded by a wall, which is not so strong as the wall of the town. The streets are regularly laid out and run parallel to one another, and the cross streets all lun at right angles. Mahomadabad is the only town I have seen in Persia which is regularly built. In one corner is the ark or citadel, where the Governor resides, and which forms a sort of keep in the event of the capture of the town. Just outside the walls there is a high circular mound which dominates the whole place. On the top of this very curious mound there were formerly some buildings. It is, no doubt, one of the mounds raised as a base for an ancient fire temple. The Turkomans discovered that these buildings were a most convenient place from which to fire down in the town, so they have been levelled, but the fiat top of the mound still rises far above the town wall.V a* 41 I took leave of‘he Begler Begi, euuI he enfreatcd me not to go without an escort though I had come without one, as I might be carried off bv Turkomans I was verv’ unwilling to take one, but I consented to do so at the Governor’s urgent reuuest ' I known in the town as a weli-to-do Armenian merchant and ' eq ' est : , l w;ls improbably ha ve been made by Turkomans to carry me off for ransmn'T I’ha?/’ 1 001 without protection, on my return journey. Some little time before leaving 1 I h j°m IndT kn ?h g er eg r W I - Was - 1 P ro P° 6e(1 “Bering Mash-had as an Englishing* and I knew the news of my being one would be brought to him from that if,™ preferred that he should hear the news from myself and not f^m oll^s P Whe^ told him who I was, he begged me not to let it be known in the town as he would J found fault with by the Governor General of Khorasan for not having reported the arrival ol an Englishman in Daragez, if he was supposed to know it ^ I was obliged to visit Mash-had because I had spent all the money I had brought with me, and could obtain no more without visiting that nlonp i i* 0U ^,^ known to the English Agent. 1 had obtained all he^nfoLfe I wanted andThl was no further object in concealment. U 1 wanted ’ and there Before leaving the Daragez district, I will describe an ™ r i . . tT.nt Ch and ‘''l ' l \ “ the village of Mukdum we^e Hving blueh tints, and f was much struck with their convenience and portability. ^ hour segments of a circle are constructed of a sort of lattice wnrk i each rather thicker than an ordinary walking stick. These pieces of lattice wiXare abo„ s ,x feet in 1,eight. Two of the segments are rather larger than the other two The two larger ones are placed in the ground, forming a half circle then the two smaller ones, and they are lashed together, forming a complete circle’ except in one , whlc , h ‘ s . tlle . do ® r - I rom the t0 P of this circle of lattice work small curved rods are led to a thing just like the outer portion of a cart wheel, which forms the apex of the tent. These rods either fasten into holes in the outer circumference of the cart ‘ wheel, or else are lashed to its rim. The skeleton of the tent is now ready and it looks like a bee-hive of lattice work; over this thick felts are fastened the space at the top surrounded by the cart wheel being left open for the smoke’to estate and ig it to enter. A separate felt is ready to be drawn over this open space m case of ram or snow. A thick felt is hung over the door Out oil sort of mat of stiff reeds similar to what is called an outside “ chick’Mn^ndTaU bound round the tent. This mat of reeds is bound round the tent only to a height of six feet, and gives stability to the whole structure The slonimr nart *1 ^ c IS of felts only After all this has been done, ropes are bounT^nd I whoTe and fasten it down to the ground. A fire is lighted in the middle of the tent’ and the smoke escapes through the hole in the roof. These tents arc very warm in the winter, and fairly cool m summer. They have no pole in the middle which is the gieat discomfort of an ordinary tent. I know of no form of tent so thoroughly com- fortable and can quite understand how almost all people of Turk race delighf in'them and dislike giving up their tree and independent life as nomads. 8 ™ ’ Everything necessary for the construction of a tent of this sort of the largest size can be carried easily on two camels, and a small one requires only one camel se . en ' to !l,&lt;e to P ltoh these tents amongst ruins or in a hollow between sand hills, or m some place where a certain amount of shelter is obtained from the rtemendous blasts which sweep over the country bordering on the Kara Kuin desert These tents, when securely fastened down, will stand in spite of a very severe gale. CHAPTER X. Thi-: Turkoman Horse. 1 must devote a chapter to the Turkoman horse, as he is the means bv which hi* .'is; s sr sssst vtz rs 5757. L r42 , These horses are not prepossessing ; at first sight they are decidedly leggy, long in the back, and long in the neck, but they soon grow on one, and when the wonderful feats of endurance they can perform are seen they are appreciated at their true value. Most grossly exaggerated statements of the feats performed by Turkoman horses are current and no one has erred in this respect more than Colonel Grodekoff, the cluet of General Skobeleffs staff. He says, in his book, “If the victim is human the « Tekkin firmly binding the hands of the prisoner, places him behind his saddle, “ securing both his legs under the horse’s belly ; fastens a rope with two long ends “ round the man * waist, and sitting in front of the victim passes the end of the rope “ under his own arms, and thus sets off on his long homeward journey. Lntil he “ reaches a safe retreat, the Tekkin, when his alaman is over, never draws rein except “ for a few seconds to water his horse. As to its food it has to eat it on the move, a “ ba' with either cakes or barley being tied under its mouth. If the Turkoman “ happens to return home by the' road he came, lie stops to recover his buried pro- “ visions, otherwise he never gets off the horse’s back, neither does he allow the “ prisoner to do so. Mustaffa, who has had personal experience, said, and other “ ex-prisoners of the Tekkins confirmed his statement, that ‘ for five days and five « ‘nights, during which time the horse never ceased galloping, his captor never once « . i e f t his saddle, neither did he drink, and only occasionally ate a handful of roasted “ ‘ millet.' ” Now the slowest pace that can be described as a gallop is not less than eight miles an hour, and this would give for the first day and night 192 miles, and for five days and nights 960 miles, carrying two men and food, which is of course absurd. It is a pity that any traveller should allow the exuberance of his fancy such wide play. I have no such feats to record of a Turkoman horse, still they are good hard working horses. I do not consider them fast. Their best pace is a quick walk ; they also have a long cantering pace'. They never trot. The best distances that I have heard accomplished is from Kala Koushid Khan to Mash-had, about 200 miles, in three^days, carrying all that the rider and horse required as food on the way. Also from Kala Koushid Khan to Khiva, 350 miles, in six days, doing the same. I have heard of a Turkoman horse covering about 100 miles in 24 hours, carrying his rider, body clothing, &amp;c. I believe a reallv good Turkoman horse will do 60 miles a day for several days together, eating very little food, but anything beyond this is pure fiction. There are no milestones in the desert, and all orientals are prone to exaggeration. The Begler Begi presented me with a horse, which was a fine specimen though old, and I purchased two Turkoman horses, one was of Akhal Tekeh breed and the other came from the Merv country. The Akhal horse was a very tall one, standing about 15 hands 3 inches. If 1 was asked to point out a distinguishing feature of the Turko man breed of horses, I should say their greatest peculiarity was their hairlessness. They have naturally very little mane, and what they have is always carefully cut off ; their tails are generally scanty. The skin is very soft and thin, and the hair on it very fine indeed. If a patch of hair is rubbed off it only grows again very slowly, and if rubbed off more than once often does not grow at all. Bare hairless patches are common, especially behind the saddle, where saddle bags are usually carried. The horses are never stabled, hut picketed out in the open. The greatest care is taken of them, and they are well clothed. First a thick felt body covering is put on of the size an English horse wears, over this an immense piece of felt is fastened, covering the hurse’s^ears and his whole body down to his hocks. This clothing is secured with a long roller, which is passed three times round the body. However little clothing a Turkoman may take for himself, he always takes all this clothing for his horse. Generally, for himself, he takes nothing hut a long sheepskin coat called a “ poshtin,” and he will sleep even in snow with nothing but this. Cer tainly Turkomans are a very hardy race, and when on their alamans do with wonder fully* little food and clothing. The horses, when in their “ oubahs” or camps, are fed on barley and chopped ? traw. On a foray they have nothing hut the hushes, or some- time* rough grass which they can pick up, hut some grain is always given them once a day. 1 made inquiries as to the barley meal and sheeps tail fat halls, which the Turkomans are said to give their horses. The Turkomans 1 saw were not accustomed to give their horses this mixture, hut flour and sheep’s tail fit or clarified butter are given all over the East to horses, when required to go through great exertion, so there would he nothing extraordinary in a Turkoman occasionally giving it. I myself in India have often given my horses 1 lb. flour, 1 lb. coarse sugar, and | lb. clarified butter made into halls when I have ridden them far and wanted them to go on again.It is, I believe, easily digested by the horse, and he is ready to start sooner than if a feed of corn is given him, and it is supposed to give great strength. Turkomans give their horses almost anything they may eat themselves. A Turkoman horse belonging to a cousin of the Governor of Daragez he assured me would eat the boiled rice of a pilaf; this is rice over which melted butter has been poured. The Turkoman horses, though hardy in respect of food, require a good deal of care as to clothing, their very fine coats* and fine skins, when at all well bred, predisposing them to catch cold during the winter season. The Russians captured a good many Turkoman horses in their various expeditions, and some were given over to the Cossacks, but as a rule they were not found satis factory. Many of them died, I believe, because they had not the amount of clothing as cavalry horses to which they were accustomed when in Turkoman hands. In h t weather these horses do well, and when well covered stand cold well also. They are said not to thrive in a stable, but I consider this is only a prejudice. Wonderful stories are related by the Persians of the Turkoman alamans, but I could not get an authentic account of any really great feat. Turkomans are un doubtedly brave men, as they have shown in their defence of Yangi Shahr, or Geok Tepe, and in many a hard encounter with the Russians, and they are held in great dread by ordinary Persians, though the Turks and Kurds of Daragez, Kuchan, and Bujnurd are always quite ready to meet Turkoman cavalry on equal terms. At pre sent, while a party of Tekeh horsemen ride over the country and drive off cattle and slaves, a party of Turkoman infantry is usually not far off. The infantry are brought up either on camels or strong donkeys, and take up a position in some ravine. The horsemen, if pressed, retire as fast as possible on the infantry, driving off the cattle The Persian horsemen press on in hot pursuit, probably in great disorder, and are presently met by a volley from a number of concealed infantry armed with a good muzzle-loading rifle, or perhaps some of the men have breech-loaders captured from the Russians. Twice while I was on the Turkoman frontier did the Persian cavalry fall into such an ambuscade. Once it happened to the Sowars of the Begler Begi of Daragez, and once to some sowars of the Khan of Khelat Nadiri. I hese tactics are quite new, and have been learnt by the Turkomans in their fighting with the Russians. The Persians of the border complain of it very much. On the 14th January 1881, I left Mahomadabad, the capital of Daragez, taking an escort of a few frontier sowars with me. I crossed the Allaho Akbar pass and stopped at a village named Derbendi the first night. The next I sent back my escort except one sowar whom the Begler Begi had asked me to take to Alash-had with me. On the 15th January I crossed the Maidan Kuni pass. The cold was intense. 1 returned to Mash-had by almost the same road by which I came, passing not far from Kuchan, but not visiting that town. As 1 have previously described the road I will not go over it again. I visited the ruins of Tus, formerly one of the chief towns in Khurasan, the place is utterly ruined and is not worth visiting. There is, however, a large mausoleum in good repair ; in it is a fine stone coffin broken in pieces, which I hear was only discovered a few years ago. Abbas Khan, the English consular agent, to whom I had sent a note in the morning, telling him I was coming, had kindly hired a house toi me. 1 remained in Mash-had from the 19th January to the 9th February. Abbas Khan was much surprised to hear that I had managed to live in this part or the country without his being aware of it for two months. He sent for one of his men who had passed through Daragez twice while I was there, on his way from Geok Tepe, and asked him why he had not told him of my being there. The man, when he saw me, said, “ I know “ that man well, 1 used to* see him in Daragez, and he used to talk to me, but I never “ thought he was anything but an Armenian, so I never mentioned him to you.” On the 29th January we heard of the fall of Yangi Shahr on the 24th, and o( the quick Russian pursuit to Askabad, and later of the arrival of General Skobeleff at Lutfabad, in the Atak district, and Kahka, in the Khelat Nadiri district.CHAPTER XI. Stay in Mash-had. T find the Persian authorities here are at present rather excited by the state of Seistan, where they expect trouble. Taj Mahomed Khan, hereditary Chief of Seistan, has arrived in that country from Kandahar. About 14 years ago, when the Shah was on a visit to Mash-had, he summoned Taj Mahomad to meet him, and when he arrived imprisoned and sent him to Teheran. Two years ago Taj Mahomad escaped, and, having some of the Biluch riding camels concealed near Teheran, made good his escape to Kandahar, in spite of the most strenuous efforts made by the Persian authorities to capture him. Some of his followers were captured. Taj Mahomad has suddenly appeared in Seistan with 100 footmen and 100 horsemen. The Chief of Chikansur in Seistan is much troubled by his arrival, as is also Jafar Khan Kajar, the Governor of Persian Seistan. Hashim Khan, the Afghan Governor of Furrah, is also much put out by the arrival of Taj Mahomad, as he looks upon him as a friend of the English and wishes him driven away. Hashim Khan has written to Jaffir Khan Kajar, saying that if he wants help to drive away Taj Mahomad he will send 1,000 horsemen to help him. A few days ago, after my arrival at Mash-had, I heard of the consternation caused in Herat by Ayub Khans having put to death Khan Agha, the Chief of the Jamshidi tribe. The Jamshidis are the most powerful of the nomad tribes near Herat. Their chief places of abode are at Kushk, on the stream of the same name, falling into the Murghab, and on the Murghab river near Bala Murghab. These Jamshidis, though really of old Persian origin, ikw consider themselves Turks. In this part of the world to be a Turk is to be noble; to be a Kurd or Ajemi is to be only respectable. The Chiefs of Kuchan, who, l believe, are undoubtedly of Kurd descent, are always called Turks on this ground. The hold of the Afghan rulers over the Jamshidis has always been ot the loosest, and Ayub Khan tried to strengthen his power by espousing the daughter of Khan Agha. Shortly previous to my arrival at Mash-had a plot was discovered, of which Khan Agha was accused of being the ringleader, to surprise Herat. News was brought to Ayub Khan that one ot the guards of the gates had been tampered with, and that the gate had been left open to a late hour. The adherents of Khan Agha had proposed to enter by this gate and surprise the town. The plot was revealed to Ayub Khan, who relieved the guard and shut the gate. Ayub Khan having put Khan Agha to death, as well as six other chief men of Herat, has caused great excitement here as well as in Herat, and fer some days it was reported that Ayub Khan had been killed, but this proved untrue. His position at Herat was at this time most critical, any one appearing before that town with a very moderate force indeed would have captured it. The son of Khan Agha, Yalantush Khan by name, fled as soon as he heard of his father’s death, and took refuge with a numerous following of Jamshidis with the Saruk Turkomans, at Punj Deh, on the Murghab river. The Jamshidi oubahs, or camps, near Kushk were plundered by Ayub Khan’s regular troops, and that tribe rendered thoroughly hostile to him. The whole of the nomad tribes in the Herat district seem to be disaffected to Ayub Khan, for, beside the Jamshidis, the Taimouris were equallv hostile to him, and he has had a great deal of difficulty in keeping them at all quiet. I met, while at Mash-had, the chief of the Persian branch of the Taimouris, w ho is a most intelligent man. ’ In case an advance was made on Herat by Isak Khan, the son of Amir Azim Khan who now rules Afghan Turkestan for Abdurrhaman Khan, and who is said to be threatening an advance by way of Maimana, the assistance of the son of Khan Agha with a numerous following of Jamshidis and probably some Saruk Turkomans, might be reckoned on by him. From what I gathered in Mash-had, Ay ub Khan’s position in Herat was a very precarious one. There was a strong combination of chiefs against him. He, however, was making head against his enemies, and in the Furrah district and in Zamindawar had a strong party in his favour. Hashim Khan, the Governor of Furrah, had much influence, and was using it for Ayub Khan, who was making every effort in his power to cast guns to replace those lost by him at Kandahar. He w’as also very much in want of percussion caps. A very large number of percussion caps45 were sent him from Mash-had, but were seized on the road and brought back to Mash-had by order of the Governor General of Khorasan, at the instance of Abbas Khan, the English consular agent. The exporters of the caps, however, were not punished. A hundred camel loads of iron were sent to Herat from another part of Persia, in spite of notice having been given to the Persian authorities of its despatch by Abbas Khan, the English agent. A few guns have been cast by Ayub Khan with this iron, but he is much crippled for want of iron, and Abbas Khan is doing his best to prevent this export, but he is not loyally supported by the Persian authorities, and, though they have forbidden the export of iron, will not punish the people who export it. I hear that the powder made by the Turkomans in Merv is very good; that they have regular mills worked by water power where it Is manufactured ; very fair rifles are also made, but percussion caps they have not as yet succeeded in making. It is, however, very curious that I have never heard of their being in want of caps, though they have almost all percussion rifles. Caps were made in Kabul, but not in Herat. They cannot manufacture any detonating compound fit for the purpose, but if fulminate of mercury, or some other detonative, were procured by them from Europe, I fancy they could manufacture and fill the caps. It is much to be regretted that we have no English officer either in Mash-had, or still better in Khaf, some seven marches to the southward, to keep our Government informed of what is really taking place in Herat. Khaf is the Persian town which has more immediate communication with Herat than even Mash-had. There are a good many Hindoo traders in the town who trade with Herat, and through whom arrangements might be made for obtaining good infor mation of all that passes there. These Hindoos would naturally be only too glad to assist any English officer who was in Khaf, as they would feel his presence a protection. During the approaching struggle between Ayub Khan and Abdurrhaman Khan it is most important that some one should be stationed there. Abbas Khan, the English Consular Agent at Mash-had, I consider to be a very able man, and he tries, in every way in his power, to obtain information, but he has not the necessary knowledge of Europe and European affairs to enable him to judge of the importance of news. He also has very little power to prevent the export of muni tions of war. The mere presence of an Englishman in Khaf, even in an unofficial position, would have a very great effect in stopping this trade. At present we have not even a native agent there. Khaf being far to the southward, and not near Turkoman territory, a British officer stationed there would not raise the suspicions of the Russians that he was placed there with the object of encouraging the Turkomans in resistance to Russia, while he would be in a first rate position as regards collecting information. There are no Turkomans anywhere near Khaf, though plundering bands of that tribe harry the caravans on the road between Khaf and Ghurian. No complications of any sort would be likely to take place if a British officer, in an unofficial way, were allowed to reside in Khaf for a short time while the struggle which is impending between Ayub Khan and Amir Abdurrhaman Khan takes place. When Azim Khan, who was afterwards Amir of Kabul, was a refugee in India, I made his acquaintance at Kohat, and I then also saw his son, Isak Khan, who is likely to play an importantq)art in the operations against Herat. If I was permitted to live at Khaf I should be able, in a private way, to open communication with him. That I am not likely to do anything that would cause a difficulty for the Government I think is shown by what I have already done. While in Mash-had I made the acquaintance*of two Tekeh Turkomans of some importance. They were Khetkhodas, or head men of families. They were Durdi Khan, of the Bukshi clan, and Niaz Mahomad Khan, of the Suchmuz clan. Durdi Khan was a typical Turkoman, with round bullet head, small Tartar eyes, and a square face; a face not all wanting in intelligence, but in which cunning was strongly marked. He had more beard than is usual amongst his countrymen. A beard always shows some mixture of Aryan or Semitic blood, as typical Turkomans, like other pure Turks, have little or no beard. 1 have observed that the Bukshi tribe seem to retain their Tartar features more markedly than other clans of the Tekeh. I heard from these men what the business was on which Syd Aly Khan, the brother 5757. Mof the Begler Begi of Daragez, had visited Kala Koushid Khan accompanied by an agent of the Persian Foreign Office. The Merv Tekeh are willing, they said, to receive a Persian Governor in the Merv country, and to hoist the Persian standard, and acknowledge themselves subjects of Persia, on the following conditions :— Seven hundred Merv Tekeh horsemen are to be taken into the Persian pay at 20 tomans, or 11. 5^., each a year. Five hundred of these men would reside on the frontier of Persian Khorasan, and guarantee Persia against any raids made by Turko mans. The remaining 200 would reside in the Merv country, partly as a guard to the Persian Governor and partly at once to bring information if any raid was con templated, so that the 500 men on the border might turn out and prevent any plundering by other tribes than the Tekeh. A good deal of plundering is done by the Saruk tribe. Fifty of the chief men of the Mferv Tekeh tribe, to be chosen by the Persian Govern ment, would live in Mash-had as hostages for the good faith of the Tekeh. These hostages would be paid a small subsistence allowance, as is usual in all eastern lands, during the time they were detained* in Mash-had, and they were to be occasionally changed so that they might visit their homes. These two men said they, as well as their tribe, were quite ready that the above arrangement should be carried out, and the Persian authorities in Khorasan were also anxious for the carrying out of the compact, but difficulties were raised in Teheran. It was believed that the Persian authorities were willing to carry out the arrangement, but it met with opposition from Russia. If the above agreement could be carried out, it undoubtedly would be for the advantage of Persia. I can well understand that Russia is averse to Persia getting any footing in the Merv country. I do not myself believe that Russia intends at present, or for some years, to occupy the Merv country. She found the Akhal Tekeh, who have only 25,000 tents, a very formidable enemy, while the Merv Tekeh, in cluding the Saruk Turkoman tribe, who act with them in any foreign w r ar, have certainly 50,000 tents. The Russians would also be further from their base of ope rations than they were in the Akhal country. The desert between the Tejeud and the Murghab extends for 85 miles, with only one spot where there is permanent water, and that is brackish (Shaitli). Even if the desert is crossed at the most favourable place, it is too formidable an obstacle to be lightly faced. The difficulties of transporting provisions across this waste would be enormous, harassed as the convoys would be by the Turkoman cavalry, and the Russians received a lesson on this subject when besieging Yangi Shahr. The Persians believe, and I do also, that the object of Russia is Herat and not Merv. The road to Herat from where they now are is far easier than the road to Merv, as there is no desert to pass, and wood, water, and grass, three of the most urgent requirements of an army, would be found in the bed, and along the banks of the Tejend or Huri Rud. The Persians would give every help, as they are persuaded that Russia intends to make over Herat when captured to Persia. The possession of that town would be ot immense importance to Russia. It would give her enormous influence in Afghanistan, which advantage might be used to trouble England, and check mate her if any differences arose between the two Powers on the Eastern question. If the conquest of Merv were determined upon by Russia, I have no doubt it would be carried out, but the advantages would be so small that I do not think it will be attempted for many years. Of course, if the Turkomans could by an intrigue be persuaded to voluntarily accept Russian dominion as they were ready to accept Persian rule, the case would be very different, and Russian agents are trying to bring this about. I am informed by Mr. O’Donovan, in a letter dated 1st May, from Kala Koushid Khan, that the Turkomans, composing a deputation favourable to the Russian cause,' no doubt men of the Akhal Tekeh‘tribe, were dismissed by the Merv Tekeh. Russian intrigues with the above object will no doubt be numerous, but I cannot think they are likely to prove very successful. A conquest of the Merv country would be very easy from Herat, after the Russians attained possession of that towm as the advance would then be made up the Kushk stream and Murghab river instead of across a desert. Persia has always stated that she could not control the Turkomans until she had possession of Herat, and a very able article written by a Persian official in support of this contention appeared last year in the “ Revue des deux Monde.” I am not at ail surprised at Persia not minding the presence of Russian troops on her frontier. They act as a protection to her most exposed frontier against Turko mans, who have hitherto rendered life there most miserable.The Russians pay for all they take, and supply a market which was much wanted for the surplus grain of Khurasan, and as the Persian Government wring every penny out of the peasant beyond what is required for a bare subsistence, the money eventually finds its way into the coffers of the State. The Shah does not fear the Russians on the Khurasan side of Persia. He knows well that the Russians have an easy road by the Caspian Sea for an attack on Persia when they please, and that the danger is not at all increased by having them as neighbours in this direction. He feels he must please his powerful neighbour, and he thinks that he rather lessens the danger to himself than otherwise by providing the Russian army of the Caucasus with employ ment in fighting the Turkomans. The Persian peasant looks upon the Russians as deliverers from his enemies. Under these circumstances it is not at all surprising that the Russians are helped iri every way by the Persian authorities. In case* that Russia considered the possession of Merv was necessary before an advance on Herat wa« made, though this is certainly not the view I take, her easiest way of proceeding would be to take possession of Sarakhs, which would be surrendered without difficulty by the Persians, and repair the canal which formerly ran from the Tejend far out into thenlesert, and reached as far as Kucha Kum, from whence it is only 20 miles to a canal from the Murghab river. Hamza Mirza Hashmut-ud- Dowlah did this when he invaded the Merv country in 1860, and a dam was raised across the Tejend in a few days by his soldiers, which filled the disused canal from the Tejend, and though the water did not reach as far as it used to do still the water from this canal was of material assistance to his army. What a Persian army was able to accomplish by three or four days of unscientific work, the Russians would do more thoroughly and completely, but even then the advance to Merv would be a very serious undertaking and a very objectless one. A few weeks previous to my first visit to Mash-had in November last, there were two Russian officers there, but they had left before ray arrival. They did not give themselves out as Russian officers, but called themselves Russian merchants. One of these was, l believe, Colonel Grodekoff, chief of the staff to General Skobeleff, and the name of the other I could not discover. I could only hear of it from Persians who mispronounce European names, they called it Colonel Demidoff oi Demikoff. In conclusion, I would add a few words about the present state of affairs at Herat. Ayub Khan seems to have overcome his difficulties, and has marched with a few battalions and some guns in the direction of hurrah. No doubt he is unpopular in Herat itself, especially with the nomad tribes, but his strength is in Furr ah and in Zamindawar, where he has many followers, and where Hashim Khan is using all his influence, which is great, for him. The man he has left in charge of the lad Moosa Khan, in Herat, and who is of course the real Governor of that place, is known as the Low eh Naib. He is a man of no great family; his name is Khushdil Khan, and he is always called Loweh Naib, which means “ Great Deputy ” in the Pushtu language. He is a great favourite of Ayub Khan’s. CHAPTER XII. History of Attempts to SuBEtuE Merv Fekeh. I will give a concise account of the attempts that have been made in modern times to reduce the Merv Tekeh country to subjection. The results have not been such as to encourage any other power to try to conquer this country, though when it is reached it is a fertile land. These attacks were, it is true, not made by a first-class power, still the lesson they teach are not without interest. The first attempt of Persia in this century to subdue the Merv country was made bv Abbas Mirza, the Crown Prince of Persia, in 1830. He left Khorasan with a large army with, I believe, the avowed intention of marching not only to Merv but to Bokhara or Khiva, and much alarm was caused in those places by the threatened Persian attack, but, as a matter of fact, he never got further than Sarakhs. He destroyed the town of Sarakhs and carried away captive a large body of Saior 1 urko- mans who inhabited that town, which must not be confounded modi err* Persian fort of Sarakhs, which is situated on the western bank of the river, and is quite a different place. The Persian fort was only built in 1850. 5757. *Vamberry, who is generally very accurate, says, “Abbas 'Virza captured Mery,” but this is a mistake. Affairs were so threatening in his own province of Khorasan that he had to return from Sarakhs without going to Merv. In 1855, the Tekeh hav ing now got the upper hand of the Saruk tribe, who formerly held the Merv country, an attempt was made by the Khan of Khiva to re-assert his authority over that fertile land. Mahomad Amin Khan, the Khan of Khiva, marched with a large army of Osbeg Turks and Turkomans to conquer the Merv country. He at first had some success, but one day his camp was surprised and himself killed by the Tekeh, who sent his head as a present to Nasur-ud-Din Shah, the King of Persia, as the Turkomans considered it would be acceptable to him. The Osbeg army retreated, and no further effort for the conquest of the country has been made by the Khans of Khiva. In 1857 a Persian army, under Sultan Murad Mirza Hissam-KSultunut, the only able general Persia has produced in modern times, marched into the Merv country. He had, in 1856, captured Herat for Persia. 1 know Sultan Murad Mirza. He is an uncle of the Shah, but is not now in favour, though allowed by all to be the ablest prince of the Kajar family. He reached the deserted Saruk fort, known to the Persians as Merv, and occupied it. Persia at this period was at war with England, and neither men nor munitions of war were supplied him, and after a time he had tb return, having accomplished little or nothing, but he brought his army back, in which he was more fortunate than the next Persian general who attempted the conquest of the Tekehs. In 1860 Hamza Mirza Hashmut-ud-Dowlah, a brother of Sultan Murad Mirza’s thought he could obtain glory by the conquest of the Merv country. He marched with an army of 20,000 men from Mash-had on the 19th May. This is much too late in the year for a march across the desert. In May the heat is very great. In the spring water is sometimes found in the desert, but in May there is no prospect of water. An advance to be successful should be commenced very early in the spring, in the beginning of February. This army did not cross the Tejend river until the 14th June, having taken nearly a month to march a little more than 100 miles through Persian territory. A small portion of this time was, however, welf spent by the Persian troops in building a temporary dam on the Tejend river, so as to turn a portion of its waters into an old canal which existed. This canal formerly reached as far as Kutcha Kum, a halting place for caravans in the desert, where there are a few brackish wells, and from whence it is only some 20 miles to the nearest water, a canal from the Mur^hab river. The canal, only hastily repaired, was fairly successful, and the water reached a place called Kourk Tepe, as it is written, though generally pronounced Gourk Tepe. No doubt with a little more skill in damming up the Tejend, and some cleaning of the canal, the water could again be made to reach Kutcha Kum. Hamza Mirza himself, a weak and incapable prince, had, as wazir and chief of his civil and military administration, a man whom all Persians curse, Kwam-ud-Dowlah, a man notorious for his cowardice, peculation, and incapacity. The military leaders were hostile to one another, and in fact everything was as unfavourable for the Persians as possible. The Persian army, which met with no opposition worth speaking of while crossing the desert, reached the deserted Saruk fort of Mowr or Merv on the 19th July, having taken more than a month to march considerably less than 100 miles. News was sent to the Shah of the capture of Merv, and great rejoicings took place at Teheran. The Saruk Turkomans at Yullatun and Punj Deh were favourable to the Persians, and the enemy consisted of oniy the Tekeh tribe. From the 16th July to 10th September the Persian army remained in this fort inactive. Urgent orders were sent for an advance on the Tekeh stronghold, now known as Kala Koushid Khan, then a mere entrenchment. Though the distance is quite inconsiderable, I believe about 16 miles, the Persians were four days accomplishing it. The country was flooded from the Murghab, and the number of the canals rendered the road almost impassable for guns. An unsuccessful attack on the Teke position was made on the 16th September, in which the Persians were worsted. * On the night of the 2nd October the Persians attempted to retire back to the fort they had formerly occupied, but were ignominiously defeated en route, and a large number captured. Mr. O’Donovan mentions that the captured guns are still lying near Kala Koushid Khan, almost on the spot where they were captured. He says there are 36 guns, varying from 4 to 18 pounders, together with some howitzers and two mort ars.The Persians declare that they only lost 32 guns, so thdse probably include some taken from the Khan of Khiva. Hamza Mirza, with a portion of his army, made good his retreat to the Saruk encampment of YullatuUj where he was well received, but after a time a quarrel ensued between a Persian soldier and a Saruk Turkoman about some provisions. The Persian killed the Turkoman, and w'as himself killed by another Turkoman. An affray ensued. Hamza Mirza, the Persian leader, on being informed of the affray, instead of trying to quell it, mounted his horse and fled up'the Murghab in tile direction of Herat, followed by the remnant of his army. The Tekeh, and also the Saruk Turkomans, joined in the pursuit, and only a very few of this army ever reached Persia again through the Afghan territory. A portion of this army was met in its flight by an English officer, Sir Lewis Pelly, who had gone out to try and render them assistance. Even as late as March last I met three men on the road to Teheran, who were soldiers of Hamza Mirza’s army, only now released after 20 years’ slavery. ’ I took one of them for a few days into my service as a groom to lead a spare horse, and had much conversation with him. One told me he had been released by his Tekeh master, in consequence of 20 years’ faithful service. Another said he had* been sold into slavery in Bokhara, and after 20 years had saved up 111., with which he ransomed himself. These poor men had had no news of their homes or families for 20 years.' They were Turks of Azarbejan, and were trying to get to their native province. One of the first pieces of news they received on entering Persia was that the Kurds had lately been plundering their homes, and that their unworthy general, Hamza Mirza Hashmut- ud-Dowlah, had died while in command of the Persian army, which was sent in pursuit of the Kurds. They were anxious to get news of their wives and families, but up to the time I last saw them near Teheran had received none. On the 9th February 1881 I left Mash-had on my return journey, and I marched via Nishabur, Sabzawar, and Sharud to Teheran. From Teheran I went to Enzelli on the Caspian. At Finzelli I embarked on a Russian steamer and went to Baku. I could not get a steamer on to Astrakan, so had to remain at Baku for nine days; during this time several steamers arrived on their way to Petrofsk laden with troops returning from the the Akhal Tekeh war. They said typhus fever of a bad type had broken out amongst the Russian troops, and that the posts were still maintained, but the number of troops w as diminished. ' This reduction has taken place every suinmer, as it is cheaper to keep the mass of the troops west of the Caspian, and send them back in the autumn when the season for campaigning arrives. Steamers on the Caspian are so numerous that there is no difficulty in transporting a large body of troops across in a few days whenever required, and if the railway to Bami is finished by the autumn, which it certainly ought to be, a large body of troops could be placed there in a very few days ready to advance wherever ordered. The troops who remain to garrison the posts are still numerous, and can be reinforced at any moment. 1 was informed that the peculation by those employed in the construction of the railway was beyond belief, and that General Scobeleff had found the engines running on the line, except two, were burning wood, which was very expensive, instead of petroleum, which was very cheap, and is always used near the Caspian. A pood, or 35 lbs., of petroleum can be purchased in Baku for about one halfpenny. All steamers burn it. The quantity of petroleum produced at Baku is prodigious. While l was there no less than 31 wells were overflowing, and the petroleum running to waste all over the land. In consequence of this product Baku has suddenly risen from an insignificant village, which it was when [ visited it 15 years ago, to be a place of more than 30,000 inhabitants. , The chief difficulty, I understand, in the construction of the trans-Caspian railway is not physical, but is caused by the peculations which goes on amongst the military engineers employed on this work, and this was spoken of as a scandal even by Russian officers. Whether the death of the late Emperor will cause a cessation of the advance of Russia next winter I cannot say, but there is no doubt that Russia is in a posh ion to advance on Herat by the Tejend river whenever she wishes, and that the difficulties of such an advance are very much less than those that have already been successfully surmounted. I forward a map with this report, which will be of use in following the report. This map has been prepared from the following sources. About 700 miles of the country traversed by myself from my own route surveys with prismatic compass. The country\ &gt;, : v v .y &gt; V.O. . •' ' v V ^ N ~ .. • watered by the Tejund and Murghab rivers from information collected from the Turkomans. The country near the Atrak river, partly from the map prepared by Major the Honourable G. Napier and partly from the Russian map. The country beyond the Persian frontier north of the Atrak river is taken from the Russian map published by their Topographical Department in 1881. C. E. Stewabt, Lieutenant-Colonel, 4th July 1881.

Its purpose being to convey the results of his intelligence gathering mission to the North-Eastern Frontier of Persia.The report largely consists of a narrative detailing Stewart's journey from Tehran to the frontier, which he undertook under the guise of an Armenian horse dealer from Calcutta. The narrative details events that unfolded during the course of his journey, but also includes detailed observations on the landscape and settlements he passes through. This includes general observations on the local economy, fauna, geology, history, and politics. Military matters are also a consideration, and it therefore includes details on Persian armaments, fortifications, garrisons, and how easy an army could be transported through the region.Much discussion is given to raids undertaken against Persia — primarily by the Biluchis and the Turkoman — and efforts by Persian authorities to defend against them. Some attention is therefore given to slave trading in the region, and how recent Russian activities have curbed the opportunities to profit from the practice. It also concerns itself with Russian expansion in the region and the extent that the Persians are willing to assist them.On folio 106 is an extract from the Times (August 1880) concerning the Indian Prince Ram Chunder; Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart claims to have met him during the course of his mission.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Edward Stewart</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Balochs (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Tekke (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Russian Turkmenistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Merv</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mashhad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Daragez</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Agriculture</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00006b#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
