I will wire the precise date as soon as possible* We should like him to proceed from Maskat Northwards to Sohar, and as much beyond that place as possible making excursions Westwards wherever conditions admit to the coastal range. We hope to send a Mohamedan surveyor of the Survey of India with him who will also make a rough reconnaissance along the route taken on 1/4 inch scale : he will if need be be left behind after Lees has gone on elsewhere, to complete aigilB...

Could you see your way to suggest this to the ^ Government of India ? When Lees has got as far North as he can he should either charter a dhow and go up the coast to Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets, or should return to Sohar or Maskat and charter a dhow thence. If any of H« 1*8 ships are available and could without inconvenience ferry him to llalcolm or Elphinstone Inlets we should of course be very grateful. If condition admit we should like him to cross the Masandam Massif from Dibah Fujairah Shinas or Sohar - but this need not be arranged for at the moment : we should, however, be much obliged if you could collect any information re current political conditions for our guidance when the time comes. lay we also ask you to be so good as to arrange for- 5 - for hired transport for the party from Maskat Northwards; males for riding and camels or donkeys for kit # I will wire precise composition of the party and amount of transport required later, I presume that H»H.

I understand from you that 'Triad' would be leaving Bombay for Dhofar about January 11th and that you would ask the S # H # 0. to be so good as to permit Lees to go in her to Dhofar with his party - viz-. Indian surveyor, interpreter, and probably 2 or ^ servants. We would probably leave the surveyor at Dhofar to make a 1/1}. inch reconnaissance of such parts of the hinterland are accessible and return to Maskat in the 'Triad' after a cursory examination of the locality. Should he find it necessary to stay longer we would send a tanker to pick him up later # As regards Masirah # We have received as you know vague reports of oil shows in this locality, it is of great importance to us and to H,H.

I can see no other way at present of getting this locality examined. The discovery of oil would be of such im portance however alike to ourselves, to the State of Maskat and to H.M's Government that I hope the authorities may see their us way to lend/assistance in the direction indicated.

Then he will charter dhow to proceed Elphinstone and Malcolm inlets and survey Masendan massif as far as possible. Then returning to Sohar try to cross to Abd Dhabi or Dibai or elsewhere on Trucial Coast. This latter journey 1 consider most problematical. He proposes party take Government of India surveyor to make quarter inch survey along Muscat Batina Coast, who will be left behind geologist's party,if necessary,to complete work. Can transport up- to about 20 Camels - and guards be supplied onr payment for journey 'so far as Muscat territory is concerned ? As regards Dhofar, same geologist with surveyor suggested to go Dhofar in January possibly when Sultan is fetched back, and will survey hinterland as far as possible, being brought back by tanker. .Necessary arrangements required for transport and guards. As regards Masirah, Wilson asks for cursory examination of this place, where oil has frequently been reported, and., proposes 'Triad' stops there while • returning farom Dhofar with Sultan.

It appears to me that your sending a geologist anywhere outside the limits of Muscat State would practically amount to your taking the advantages of what is termed an •Exploration License 11 , without the same having been granted by the Arab Chief concerned* If this view is correct,it seems to me that the Colonial Office will have to be consulted as to whether the Arab Chiefs concerned should be approached regarding the passage of your party without a proper Oil Concession being first negotiated with each one on the lines of the Muscat Concession. I fully appreciate the endless delay which would be occasioned If we were to try to get separate con* -cessions from each and*all of the petty chiefs concerned.

The same conditlonc appear to apply to your proposals regarding uatar, and here again, a proper oonoesslon involfing an Exploration License would appear to be necessary before your geologist enters that tract because« when all Is said and done, the travelling of your geologist through that territory In reality and technically amounts to ••exploration'.

I take this opportunity to say that if the Survey of India could see their way to complete the 1 million series of India and Adjacent Countries by adding thereto sheet 3, 4 and 11 it would make the series of much greater general use as wall maps etc., and series of standard sheets covering Oman is much needed - e.g. the Southeastern Arabia sheet of the Southern Asia series.1950. , COPY v 3 i - 11-9-25.

Capt., Under Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. jT' \\J -i^uract from Muscat Diary . • 1, dated the 4th. 1926. * * * -it 9. Reference diary entry ^o. 278 of 1925, Messrs. Lees and ^ray, geologists in the employ of the An^lo-tersian Oil Company, or more correctly of the D f Arcy Exploration Company --the parent Company responsible for all ex ploration work, -- returned to Muscat from their two months 1 travelling on the 26th December 1925. I attach a sket chm ap showing the places visited by &gt;C them. l&amp;r. Lees informs me that they had a most successful expedition and were universally well treated by the Shaixchs and tribesmen, Captain jiccles, Co/fiaiandi .a^ the Muscat Infantry, acco. i.panied the party and superintended all the social and political part oi their travels, while Abdulla Williamson (an Snjlishman who nas become Muslim and who is employed. ^ the An^lo-Persian Gil Company as a 'Sales Superintendent') assisted him and looked after the trans port. Mr. Lees was naturally reticent on the subject of oil and I equally naturally did not question him. It would appear however that no indications of oil were found. Imo minerals' were found except two worked out copper mines, whose existence even was not known to the neighbouring villagers. Mr. Lees told me that the persons who had found the copper mines must have been tFerv knowledgeable as the indications of copper were very meagre. There. i~ a jood deal of- iron in the mils and the ideologists found that this seriously affected their compasses if placed o • - -.e ^round, an It is/interestin^ fact that.the jeolo^ists were invited by the Shaikhs of Baraimi to visit that tract, butbut the invitation was due to a hope that their presence would stop Isa 'bin Saleh coming to Bar&amp;imi, as the latter was then successfully advancing up the Bhahira in the direction of Barimi. Mr. Lees tells me that on ifewo occasions shots were fired across the advance of their caravan by Bedouins, but ..hen they raade themselves known, the Bedouins were quite friendly. On one occasion Mr. Lees was on a hill collecting specimen rocks alone when a very uncouth shepherd bejan to throw stones at him. This nuisance bein^ continually repeated, Mr. Less charged the shepherd .vavii^ his geological hammer, wnereat the shepherd fled. This was the only incident of,the sort, and this lonely shepherd ♦ had probably not heard of the arrival of the travellers and could not make out what' strange being had invaded his solitude. The party were accompanied by a botanist, a Mr. Fernandez.-of the Bombay Natural History Society. Mr, Lees appears to c'licw been generously provided with presents for the Shaikhs and all concerned by 'his Company, and the expedition was a great success from the 'political' point of view. Messrs. Lees and Gray left Muscat on tne j^ritibh India Mail steamer on the t 3rd instant for Bombay. T^ere they Join H.M.S. 'Triad 11 which is proceeding toDhofar to fetch His Highness the Sultan bacic to Muscat. The geologists will now explore Dhofar. The length of their stay there will depend on the character of tne geological formations, and whet er the same w ive hopes 01 oil* The country round Sur anu Masira Island will be explored later if the tribesmen and Shaikhs are amenable.H'' 1, Tel., D.T.
