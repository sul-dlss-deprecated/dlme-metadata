Each report, marked secret, opens with an introductory statement consisting of notes on the global food supply situation, including political developments. The reports are then divided into two sections, with information on the food supply, on the one hand, and that of materials on the other. Each section is broken down into parts relating to a particular food or material type. Many reports also include notes on recent or upcoming changes to the allocation and supply schedules.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Supply Mission (Middle East)</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food supply</topic></subject><subject><topic>Reports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00015d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
