Ministry Finance interrogated confirmed that property in question was situated within FAO NAHIYA and said that judges were evidently prepared to follow/ precedent of judgment enclosed in my letter November 3rd and to transfer case to Land Settlement. However when case opened opposing lawyer pleaded that appeal was not valid as security for costs (which has to accompany all appeals) was incorrectly worded (point was that document declared, surety would accept all liability for costs instead of that he accepted all liability - future tense was used instead of present). Court admitted this plea and rejected appeal. British Judge agrees that this was a proper and unavoidable decision and attributes gross ignorance of complicity to Shaikh’s lawyer for having drafted Hi documents as he did. Privately he indicates one possible loop-hole. Judgment given Court assume first instance at Basra has not yet been served on four of named defendents. Shaikh’s lawyer should arrange for service and then mafce new appeal on behalf of these four persons. If judgment is given transferring case to Land Settlement appli/2 application could then he made to court on similar ruling to he applied on all defendants. This device has not been revealed to Shaikh's lawyer since ; having regard to Judge's comments mentioned above, Shaikh or his advisor may wish to entrust case in other hands. - PRODHO^ffl -Telegram - S.

To The Hon’ble the Political resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrain. Subject: - Pate Gardens Appeal Case. In continuation of my tele- ram No. 44, dated the 3th February, 1939, I have the honour to inform you that I have seen Abdul Jalil Partu, Lawyer to His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, and discussed the recent appeal case. I attach to this report a trans- found out of order, and so disiaissed the case, the lawyer has pointed out in his letter that in fact the definite future tense was not used. I attach a copy of the document, in Arabic and English. Both in its form, and in the oruinary written usage, 0j —^ * is imperfect tense. To make it definite future tense as the Kevd. G.T. THATCHER says in his well known Arabic Grammar, adding, page 73, paragraph 4, ’•The imperfect in itself denotes only unfinished action”. Sir, lation of a letter from him to the Shaikh in the same cormec** — 2 . With regard to the document, which the Court f: ~ or u* should be placed in front of it «tr./r. Vm ::83 of 'Snsr* 9 U 10 wil known authority on the Arabic language, I have consulted privately, holds the vietf that the construction put on the sentence by tho Court, ooourring as it does in a dated document, md in its context, is an incorrect one, and he agrees that the my toe rhaixh^a lawyer views toe use of .£1 in the sentence conoenaed is correct* ■Mrther, as you will see frora rxis letter, % the lawyer points out that many times without question the Baghdad Appeal Courts have accepted the surety In the form in which he put it* In any Oise no special form is laid lo?n, although some lawyers, he tells me, do use the past tense in the 'urety document. He also quotes the decision in Case Ho. 247 of 1920 in toe Appeal court which ma as follows: - 'A surety bond is effective when the surety accepts to be so. Buoh acceptance should incl&amp;ie toe wort surety' or any other equivalent word - sections 621 and 622 of tho HJallah Code* 1 . 3* The Judgment of toe Appeal Court quotes article 622 of the Civil Code of Iraq - M Hnjallah - and article 186 of the Civil j rocafrire Law of Iraq. I attach Arabic and English oopias. These articles seen to me to contain absolutely no warrant for toe Judgment given by the /ppeal Court, and therefore it would further appear that it is the Appeal Court, who, in lightly dismisaini the case in tola manner, have shown irregularity. Ir. 0 •Hearn, the Judge of the Court of First Instance at Basra, informed me, only this week, that/% - 3 - that the Shaikh’s lawyer has the reputation of being the straightest lawyer of the Basra bar, and is well known to be at enmity with the notorious Salman Shawwaf f the opposing lawyer. He himself, if he had to pick upon a good lawyer in Basra, would choose P\BTU. 4. Tith regard to the course suggested in Ambassador, Baghdad’s telegram No. 4 of the 7th February, the remaining defendants concerned are: - (a) The inheritors of the late HAMAD bin MUBARAK as SABAH, who died after judgment of Court of First Instance. (b) Mariam, Ayesha and Sabika daughters of Shaikh Salim as Sabah, and Hussa bint Shaikh Salman al Eamud, whose names apparently omitted in error by the opposing lawyer. 5. Meanwhile I suggest that the course proposed by the lawyer in his letter is also worth trying. He quotes, for authority for this course, article No. 3 of the law of 30th July 1329 A.H. and article 254 of the Iraq Civil Procedure Law. Judge 0’MEAHA informes me that such action must be taken within thirty day$s of delivery of Judgment by the Appeal Court; so no time should be lost, if an attempt to obtain revision is to b&lt; made. In this, we could, of course, seek the aid and advice of the British Embassy, Baghdad, where PARTU could be instructed to go pending the arrival of AHMAD RUSHDI BEY.

Aftar QompliiaQnts. X h£*ve received your telegram, ■». wrote a letter to you in which 1 mentioned the details of the case which are as follows In view of what had happened, it appears that the Court of Revision have intentionally passed their judgment against us* When the resolution of the Land Settlement was published and they had no power to deal with the case on its merits, they turned to the form of the AppeM Case.i.e., the appeal cannot be accepted unless a surety bond concerning ex senses has been attached with the memorandum of appeal. We had executed a surety bond bearing the signature of Layid Hamid Bey an-Naqib, but the Court objected to the form in which it was drawn up saying that it was incorrect vas it was put in the future tense, whereas a surety bond should be put either in the past 02 present tense). It was, therefore, considered that the memorandum of appeal was submitted without a surety bonu anu, in view of this, it aid not fulfil the legal conditions, ana was thus rejected. The judgment of the Court of First Instance is deemed as not appealed from conclusively within the recognized period. This order of the Court i* contrary to law and fact since, firstly, the surety bond was written in this way, ”1 hereby undertake to be a surety and guarantee etc. n The Court held that it was written in the future tense as the word ” ^^1 was whereas the wora ' Is a present verb which gives/-' ,-ivos both present ana future meanings. It shall never naan a future tense unless the prefixes ' ^ ' n « bave been acideo. to it. ihe use oi Cgr* with the expression ”1 hereby undertake ,t which very distinctly means the present tense t does not make it possible of being used as a future tense, but its meaning would be restricted to that of the present tense. This annuls the statement of the Court in this respect. In any case, the Article to which the Court referred,i.e. , 622 of 'AL ilAJALLAlf does not contain any requirement that the wording of the surety bond should be in the present or past tenses, but the said Article is in general terms and accepts as correct any expression indicating surety according to custom and usage. I used to write surety bonds for all the oases which I used to submit in the past in this way anc the Court used to accept them as correct. I can obtain from the Liotury Public certified copies of the surety bonds executed in this form in the cases which have met with success This is a summary of the case. As regards the way in which we can deal with it, there is one course,i.e., the opinion of experts in the language should be obtained about this expression and then a demand for* the revision of the Order is to be made after consulting the Law Committee about the question of revising this Order. According to law, it is admissible to adhere to it in respect of judgments passed by tne Court of Revision. The Order in question was passed by the Appeal Court but, as the judgments of the Iraqi Appeal courts are conclusive ana not liable for revision, I prefer that we should adhere to the course of demanding a revision of the Order. If we do not succeed/-succeed, we will then file a attach the property at once. Usual Ending.Translation of th$ surety Bond.

Here is a query,i.e.,if, for instance, the memorandum of appeal was submitted 10 days prior to the expiry of the recognized period and, after service of documents on the respondent and appointment of a day for hearing, the 10 remaining days of the period passed,and during the hearing the respondent objected that the surety bond was incomplete, as the Notary Public had not certified the suitability of the surety, and the Court considered this his objection justifiable, will the memorancum of appeal be rejected on the ground that the period which is ‘60 days had passed as having commenced from the date of the announceinent of the judgment until the date of giving out this Order, or the submission of the plaint to the Court makes the period tM$xm current and, therefore, admissible to complete the surety bond within the remaining 10 days which start from the date of the announcement of this Order? A similar question came up before the Court of Revision at Constantinople which issued a decision on the 14th November 1318 to the following effect:- The applicant for revision applied for a revision of the judgment 17 days prior to the expiry of the/-the revision period. He should, with effect froia the date of the announcement of this order to him, submit a fresh plaint containing revisional requirements as provided in the last paragraph of article 225 of Civil Procedure Law. This order of the Revision Court concerns the revision and its requirements. If we accept the opinion given in the appeal ana its requirements, we will be making a move nearer to justice anu law. The Iraq Court of appeal confirmed this opinion in several decisions, thus the requirements which are not fulfilled were completed during the remaining period which commences from the date of the announcement of the order passed regarding the existence of unfulfilled requirements.

Subject: - Date-gardens of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that during a recent visit to Basrah, the Shaikh of Kuwait's lawyer, Abdul Jalil Partu, gave me the following details about the position of the Shaikh's opponents. The original claimant is the deceased Ayesha az-Zuhair who left behind one son, Abdullah az- .uhair, and two daughters j, 'Ayeda and Najiba, daughters of Jamad az-iuhair. Abdullah is dead but has one surviving heir named Kamal, and Ayeda is also dead but has one surviving son, whose agent is Abdur Hahman an-Na'mah. Najiba is still alive. Sulaiman ash-3hawaf is the agent of Najiba and Kamal. In her lifetime, Ayesha was indebted to certain people at Constantinople to the extent of 16.000 Dinars. When her creditors came to know that the Shaikh's appeal had failed, they applied for and obtained an attachment of the Shaikh’s property upto the sum of 10.000 Dinars. The Shaikh's lawyer informs me that, according to law, these creditors will have to be ready2 to ‘bear their share of the value of the property if the Shaikh files a suit for its value.

I wish to infonn you that the period allowed for appeal is 30 days as from the date of the announcement of the judgment. The judgment was delivered to me on 13/9/1938 and I submitted an appeal on the same day. Therefore, not even one day of the appeal period has passed. If you choose that a fresh surety 'bond is to he prepared and a fresh memorandum of appeal submitted in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 186 of the Civil Procedure law and the opinion of Baud Samrah, who made comments on this article, a copy of which I had already handed to you when yom visited me on 11/2/1939, we should submit same within 30 days with effect from the day on which the previous memorandum of appeal was rejected,i.e.,the 6th February 1939. This hope will he quashed and this course will no more become within our reach on 7/3/1939. To he known to you. ' &gt; If, on the other hand, you prefer the course of amending the decision under Article 3 of the Temporary Law published on 30th July 1329, the request is to he submitted within 30 days as from the date of the announcement of the Order of the Appeal Court to us (which has not yet been done). If you wish to have my advice as to which course we should adopt now, I beg to say that I recommend the former course,i.e., preparing a fresh surety bond and submitting a fresh memorandum of appeal, as this course, firstly, stops the contention that the Court had erred in the interpretation of the wording/*worcling of the surety hond. and, secondly, it does not give way for adopting the latter course,i*e., amendment of the decision. It further necessitates an extra expense of 300 Dinars. It is necessary to get the advice of three distinguished lawyers of Baghdad on this point. I prefer asking the following lawyers: - His Ex&amp;llency Us tad Muhammad Ali Mahmud, ay- Minis ter of Finance. His Excellency Nusrat al Barisi, Ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs. Us tad Yusuf al Kahir. If they decided that a fresh plaint should he submitted and that the Court is compelled to hear the case when such a plaint is submitted, we will submit it, otherwise we will not do so but will adhere to the latter course as it will not cause any material or moral loss to us, save a sum of 5 Turkish Liras. In any case, we must adhere to this course. If you consider consulting the said lawyers and taking action in accordance with the last paragraph,i.e., submission of a fresh plains, it is necessary to get the advice of the said lawyers and submit the plaint at once; but, if you prefer adopting the other course, we have ample time as the recognized period has not yet expired.

I believe the court’s ruling to be obviously erroneous from the linguistic point of view, there being no special form of future tense in the Arabic language, and the so-called fudhari (quasi-present) form serves to indicate both the j resent and the future. &amp;hen the future is to be indicated in iarticular the prefix 'ea* or w aauf' is used with the verb.

J 13 1 Copy forwarded with compliroente to the Political Agent,.1044/39. 17th February 1939. V-it-i reference to your letter of the 31st January, Ho.144.S, about the matter of compensating the Sheikh / of Kov/eit for taxation losses on his date gardens in / xraq, I hasten to send you the enclosed copy of a demi- Oi_icial letter from the Foreign Office to the Treasury which has just reached me. The Foreign Office consider that the way is now open for an approach to the Sheikh, and as you will probably wish to attend to the matter while you are in Koweit we will endeavour to send you instructions very shortly. 2. bou will see that the enclosure confirms your view that the Sheikh is merely to be told what compensation His Majesty's Government propose to make. We understand that the Treasury letter of 12th January was not intended to suggest that there should be any argument with the Sheikh about the amount of compensation: the reference/ m’ble Jut .Colonel Sir T.C.W.Fowle, KCIE.,C3E., Political Agency, Koweit.reference to negotiations alluded only to the arrangements that will have to he settled with the Sheikh for the setting up of a family council and for the execution of a form of discharge which will terminate His Majesty’s Government’s liability. y*. 3. With reference to paragraph 3 of the enclosure we assume you are still of the opinion which you expressed here last September that the whole of the compensation, and not merely that for future losses, should be paid to the family council. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter and enclosure to Metcalfe and to de Gaury.POP.EIGI-T OFFICE, S.W.l. 15th February, 1959. 941/39/93) Dear Hale, f ' Will you please refer to your letter to Baxter S.32453/17 of the 12th January regarding the amount of compensation in respect of future taxation to he paid the heirs of the Sheikhs of Howeit and Huhammerah. To the figure you mention there will, of course, have to he added tax until the present time. 2. The way now seems open to approaching the Sheikh of Koweit, and we assume that the India Office will go the lines decided upon at the interdepartmental meeting last year ( cf. paragraphs 8 to 11 of the record enclosed that the Sheikh shall he told that His Majesty’s Government that, as the estates belong to all the heirs of the late Sheikh, we make it a condition that His Highness shall set up a family council, to whom the payment will he made. last sentence of paragraph 9 of record) that it migh'c he necessary to distinguish between the amount to he paid as compensation for taxation losses from 1932 to the date of the payment of compensation, and the amount to he paid on account of future prospective losses, the first being paid to the Sheikh himself, and the second only to the council. This is not a matter on which we have any very decided views, and for our part we are quite ready to proved past losses since the in reduction of the Istihlak ahead with the preparation of instructions to Bushire, on in our letter to you E 2751/28/93 of the 5th August), i.e. are prepared to make this payment in respect of taxation losses on the late Sheikh Mubarak’s estates in Iraq, hut You will remember that it v/as also agreed (cf. accept/ E. Hale, Esq., Treasury.accept whatever the ±ndia Office decide to he the proper solution, 4, You will also remember that in paragraphs 15 to 17 of the record it was stated that the Iraqi Government would have to he informed of His Majesty's Government's proposals to pay compensation, and also of the amount of compensation which they propose to pay 3 before the Sheikh of Eoweit and the heirs of Sheikh Khazal of Muhammerah were approached. The reason for this was that we did not wish to prejudice our right to claim hack from the Iraqi Government any compensat on paid to the two Sheikhly families. The position in this respect has heen altered to some extent hy the terms of the note from the Iraqi Government accepting the comprehensive settlement proposed to them in 1936 (cf. copy in our letter E.6576/29/95 of the 25th ITovemher last). As you will remember* the British proposals with regard to the taxation issue were that His Majesty's Government were prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two Sheikhs from taxation in Iraq* provided that the Iraqi Government would, for their part, (a) give a formal undertaking, in writing, to make no claim for arrears of taxation against either Sheikh in respect of their properties in Iraq, and (h) provide a formal written assurance that no discriminatory taxation will he imposed on the properties of either in future. This would mean that the settlement of the financial compensation to he paid to the Sheikhs on account oi the incidence of the Istihlak tax would become a matter for settlement/(%V settlement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikhs themselves. 5. However, although the Iraqi Government have said that they are prepared to give the undertaking requested at (a) above, they have only given it conditionally, i.e. if the legislation, which they say they are prepared to propose is passed. If they do not introduce the legislation, they could not without a breach of the undertaking in their note revive their claims for pre- 1932 taxation. It is however possible, though we hope unlikely, that the legislation might be introduced but rejected, and in its absence we are, I suppose, still in the position of wishing to reserve a theoretical claim to recoup ourselves from the Iraqis for anything we pay to the Sheikhly families, as a weapon in case the Iraqis revived their taxation claims. 6. Y/e think therefore that, v/hen the time comes, and unless the legislation has been passed by then, the Embassy might inform the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, unofficially, of the payments that we are proposing to make to the Sheikhs and of the amounts. They could add, if they think it discreet, that this is done in view of the contingent claim upon the Iraqi Government, which we do not wish to prejudice until the legislation about pre-1932 taxation exemption was passed. We shall be glad to learn whether you agree. 7. To turn to the heirs of the late Sheikh Khazal, we were glad to see that you are able to agree that the same interest rate should apply to them as to the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak. We realise that the news of any approach made to the Sheikh of Koweit is likely to become generally known, and that when they hear of it the heirs of/4* of Sheikh Khazal will no douht for their part press us to make an immediate payment in respect of compensation. If they do so ? we shall have to tell them that v/e cannot pay them until we have decided what a fair estimate of their average annual loss is (although when this decision is taken they will he paid on the same principle as the heirs of Sheikh Mubarak) 3 and we do not propose that the approach to the Sheikh of Koweit should he delayed on that account. However, it seems desirable to press on as quickly as possible with the Muhammerah investigations, and we are therefore asking the Mrnbassy at Bagdad to expedite a reply to the enquiries in our letter E 6330/30/93 of the 15th Hovember last. 8. This letter was drafted before the receipt here of Peel's letter P.Z.306/39 to Baxter of the 3rd February. I have not, however, thought it necessary to alter its terms since it seems to answer Peel’s two questions 5 , our view, in fact, being that it is not necessary to hold up action vis-a-vis of the Sheikh until wc have spoken to the Iraqis, but that all the same we should tell the Iraqis what we are doing. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to Peel at the India Office. Yours sincerely, 3d. Lacy Baggallay/ p.z. 982/39. India Office, V/hitehall, London, S.W.l. 15th February, 1939.

In his telegram of the 13th February T/26, Fowle has misunderstood our telegram of the 11th which of course was intended to convey that the Foreign Office suggestion meant taking the case completely out of the Sheikh’s hands, out , Sri ** you will see that at the end of his telegram No.T/20, he suggests that Rushdi Bey (or a substitute) should be fetched from Egypt as soon as possible to conduct the case, at the expense of His Majesty’s Government. T 7e agree that this should be the immediate step to be taken and we are inclined to think that if this is done, and the Sheikh’s lawyer in future proceeds under Rushdi Bey’s instructions, this should be sufficient to ensure that the case is handled/ ggallay Esq. , oreign Office, S.W.l,handhandled properly, without going to the length of finding an Iraqi lawyer to replace the Sheikh’s choice, v/hich would probably add to the expense, give the Embassy some further trouble, and perhaps cause some embarrassment with the SheikhV But if you would prefer to have Fowle's views on the point, we will of course consult him again. With regard to the question of the Sheikh claiming recovery of the purchase price of the property one would a&gt;A( infer from Fowle’s telegram T/26. that no such action has yet been taken (cf. the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Basra Court’s judgment, copy enclosed with India Office letter of the 11th November, P.Z. 7489/38)• f If that is so, it would soem desirable that something should be done in the matter without delay and it is for considerstion whether the Sheikh should be advised to take up this question immediately with his lawyer - irrespective of any decision that may be taken to assist or even replace the latter at the expense of Governmen€\.

DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE.Translation of judgment passed Py the Application Department, Court of Revision on 11th November 1318 A.H. The Application Department in the Court of He vis ion, on examining the application and its appendices submitted by applied for revision of the judgment passed on 13th April 1318 in the case occurring between him and Khaja Zadeh Khalil Effendi, resident of Orfah, found that the said applicant ^ undertook to pay Court expenses, any loss and damage that might be sustained by the plaintiff, whose properties have been attached on account of this application for revision. As the monetary surety is considered to be an acceptance of liability by one person for another and an undertaking given by a surety for what might be claimed from the original person, and as one nerson cannot be an applicant and a surety at the same .. time, the surety bond which is required to be connected with the application for revision, under article 222 Ox the Civil Procedure Law, is, therefore, not in existence. Petitions which are not prepared in accordance with Article 221 and 222 of the said Law are rejected, but, if the | al 2 0 - We( L f , or revision has n ^yetexpired ^,,^6 app licant^ can su ' bm ^ ^ a r ^ esh application containing the conditions required by law. As the i ii i mu judgment in question was communicated to the applicant on 15th April 1318, and application for .revision was submitted to and registered at the Court of that place on 28th July 1318, and as the judgment in a^estion is appealable and was announced in the presence of the parties, the 60 days, which is the period for revision, start from the date on which the appeal period fixed in Article 219, expires. After counting, it transpired that the application for revision was submitted 17 days prior to the end of the period allowed for revision. Therefore, the applicant, with effect from the date of the communication of this judgment to him, has the option to do the needful within the remaining period, in accordance with the last paragraph of Article 223 of the said Law. Hasdar Effendi bin A1 Haj A s dd Effendi, resident of Orfah, who &lt;In the circumstances, and under paragraph 1 of the said Article, it has teen unanimously decided to reject the application for revision and the applicant is to hear revisional expenses paid hy him.

No.5. Dated and received 28th February 1939 Moat Urgent Resident’s telegram Ho.T/49. Following represents beet opinions I have been able to obtain in stricteat confidence. (a) Unable to comment because law referred to cannot oe identified. (b) Procedure outlined by Daud atuar&amp;h page 628 does not seem to apply (see page 626) because document was hel4 to be not an incorrect guarantee but no guarantee at alii consequently appeal documents fere quoted sb initio (c) Court of Appeal appears to be only authority competent to transfer case to Land Jettlement Committee. (d) All or aoeae of defendants on \*h om Basra judgment has not yet been served should appeal at once (this I am told can be done without service or after service has been obtained on application). (e) I suggest that consideration of this course can wait. 2* Further course strongly recommended to me is as follows: Appellant should at once file fresh appeal (documents being correctly drafted) with application to Preaident of Court of Cassation to admit time expired appea. under discretion given to him by /article 7 (2) repeat Article 7 (2) of Courts’Jjroclronati on of December 27th 1917 ^amended /(amended by Court*s (revision of) proclamation of 1921). If thia application is admitted appeal would be re-heard end (we may hope) case transferred to Land Settlement. It cannot however be guaranteed that President of Court would accept application. 3. Best course therefore seems to be combin&amp;tl&lt; of (d) and above. surety bond mentioned in Resident’s telegram T/54 wis probably accepted by Court because no ob ection was raised by opposing Counsel. 4. Thoee whom I have consulted agree that nothi good could come from action through diplomatic channel. Government have no power to compel Court of Appeal to revii judgment and such action would antagonise Court of Appeal. p^irmscK.Teleepraia ’Tom To ‘t pouted Jopy by poet to vJopy ^iven to lo.T/TO 3 oiltical HtBldoatt at l uwalt. ^mbaoeador^ ba^ad* Secretary of 4tate for India, london, Government of India, :*# Delhi, lolitical *^ent f Kuwait.

Ii through no voluntary act of their own they should be subsequently dispossessed of lands covered by the 1914 pledge and His Majesty’s Government should become liable to compensate them His Majesty’s Government will hold themselves entitled, in assessing the amount of compensation, to take into account the amount included in the present offer in respect of the future taxation of such lands.

Finally there is the question of a possible Iraqi claim for arrears of taxation for the years before 1932, which His Majesty’s Government are endeavouring to avert by negotiation with Iraqi Government. You should not volunteer any reference to this point, and if Sheikh should himself raise it you should merely say that the risk is hypothetical, that His Majesty’s Government cannot say in advance what action they would take if it materialises, but that position of the heirs in regard to it is in any case not prejudiced by leaving it aside now.

That might not concern us, but tfilly nilly it did concern those others, the heirs of the collateral ancestors, whom the family had always recognisod as necess rily benefiting by the promise ^iven by us to Mubarak. As responsible administrator of the estate he did not feel that he could agree to the Council suggested, Shaikh Abdulla 3 n .lim, he subsequently told us, entirely supported him. 3. The aspect, mentioned by the Shaikh, has particular reference to the Farhaniya (and KUSHASHIYAH) Estate, bought some 65 years ago, and to the al Fao Estate held, for over a 100 years, under a deed of gift to the whole SUBAH family, who number some two hundred or more persons. 4. No doubt what the Shaikh fears is the opening up of claims for cash payments from distant branches, (see, in this connection, the mention of a claim at page 2, paragraph 4 of / ^ n /fc 3MF'' the annexure 11 to Kuwait Agency letter No. 0-294 of the 15th November, 1934) contrary to the local and Subah family inheri- ^ tance practice, whereby to save the uneconomic breaking up of estates at death, through piece-meal distribution, as could be demanded under Shara Law, it is often decided, as it has been in this case, by the heirs in agreement, that the head of the family shall continue to administer the estates aM periodically distribute the net income, in kind, to the heirs concerned. Thus the heirs of the collateral ancestors have not only benefited by our promise to Shaikh Mubarak (who was^as head of the family ^administrator of the estates on behalf of his co-heir^ but also, in recent years, suffered losses due to the imposition of the ISTIHLAK law of taxation by the Iraqi Govern tent. 5. In effect the Shaikh, as I understand it, meant to say 'are you going to recognise our old family and quite customary system, or do you intend, by insisting on a family council ofof Mubarak’s heirs, to invite claims for a cash distribution, an! hence considerable trouble and a most uneconomic result. Some people, if the money is to be distributed, will be due perhaps only £ 30/- out of the £.30,000, and there will be endless squabbles and in any case we are, as a matter of fact, incapable of working it out satisfactorily, or agreeing that it is satisfactory even if it were proved to be distributed correctly. Moreover, if you mm confine the Council to the heirs of Mubarak the other inheritors of the Farhaniya and Fao estates will have a great deal to say, anl put in petitions to you. If you insist on proceeding on these lines, tiiere may have to be much further correspondence on the subject with His Majesty’s Government, you will land me in diffi culty, help to break up the SUBAE family, and defeat your om purpose, equity'. 6. An alternative plan is that the signing of the formal dis charge by the Shaikh should be done with some formality and local publicity, i.e, bn the presence of all the grown up male members of the Subah who are in Kuwait at the time. 7. This little ceremony would naturally have to take place at some days notice, and therefore there would be time for any of the Subah to approach us, and make representations if they v/ished. I do not think that they will do so, because I believe that they think that the Shaikh is right, but they are now sufficiently emancipated from his control to speak up without fear if they wish. Should any of the heirs of Mubarak make a protest, we can hold up our discharge, and ask what Shaikh Ahmad has to say about it. 8. If this course is agreed upon, the form of the discharge will have to be amended, and the words 'to the Council which has been set up to represent in this matter the heirs of the late Shaikh Mubarak which consist of the following persons' be deleted.

Their Agent Advocate Abdul Jalil Bartu. Respondent:- Advocate Suleiman ash Shawwaf, Guardian of the insane Kamal bin Abdullah bin Isa az Zuhair in relation to the estate of Abdullah az Zuhair and estate of Ayesha az Zuhair* Subject:- The Court of First Instance, Basrah, decided, on 15th July 1938 in Court of First Instance Case No*373/932, to prevent my clients, the appellants from raising objection against the heirs of Ayesha az Zuhair, and cancelling Tapu documents No.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, dated August 1915 (for properties) situated at Faddaghiyah^raising their hands frcm them and registering the same in the name of the heirs of Awasha az Zuhair* The judgement of the Court of First Instance was communicated to me on 13/9/1938 and on the same day I submitted a memo* of appeal and paid the necessary fees* When the case came up for hearing by your Court it was decided that the Surety Bond attached with the memo, of appeal waswas written in the future tense and it was, therefore, oonsidered that a Surety Bond was not present, that the memo* of appeal was devoid of the necessary conditions and for last this reason it was rejected. As the/para of article 186 m of the Civil procedure Law declares that if the appeal period has not yet expired, the unfulfilled requirements can be completed and, that should there be necessity for the preparation of fresh application, the appellant is entitled to do so# In view of this clear legal statement and the comment oil this article by Ustad Sayid Baud Samra, who said, **A decision was passed by the Court of Revision at Constantinople on 14/11/318 allowing the completion of the Surety Bond during the rest of the period of 30 days commencing from the date of the announcement of the order in respect of the rejection of the application, and the Iraqi Appeal Court upheld this opinion in several decisions of theirs; thus the unfulfilled conditions were completed within the remaining period*# As the decision passed on 14/11/318 was in connection with a case ahich was exactly identical with this one (as can be seen from the copy of order attached) the Court of Revision considered that the Revisional Surety bond was not in existence and your honourable Court held the same view in this case too# As I prepared a fresh Surety bond in which the surety undertook to accept liability for all losses, damages, necessary expenses, travelling expenses, fees and Court fees which might be sustained by the Respondent when my clients have been found unjustified in their appeal, I request that a day for hearing may be fixed, the Respondent be summoned, an order be passed reversing judgement appealed frcm^the case of the plaintiff ( the Respondent) be rejected and he be made to bear all Court fees, Advocate fees for conducting the litigation before the Courts of First lAtanoe and Appeal and fees for theI ■ III II ■ •5- the preparation of this petition for the following reasonss- (1) My client - the appellant - is the Chief of an Kmirate (the Stairate of Kuwait)^ independent in all her atfairs from IRAQ and the Government of Iraq has no &gt; sovereignty over it* In view of the general International Law the ordinary Courts have no jurisdiction to try any head of Government or pass a judgement against him* This is supported by the views of all lawmakers* The Cyclopedia of English and Imperial Laws states (as translated) as follows in this connection:*- w It is not permissible to try Governments and their heads before the Courts as that goes against the sense and principles of the International Law* No exceptions are to be made to this except in 2 cases, i*e* when Gcwrernmente or their heads enter into litigations before the Courts as parties to a case, the defendant is empowered to submit a demand to them.; and, if such a Government or its head owns properties in the hands of a third person, they can be tried with this person* This also applies to Headsof Protected States and Districts f *s it does to kings.* Part 1.4805 sub para: 404 and 405 of the said authority. There are other views and decisions to this effect which I mentioned in my petitions to the Court of First Instance# The Respondent agreed with me on this point and showed his readiness to except His Highness Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sub ah from the case whereas the International Agreement to which I referred, as can be seen by your honourable Court in para 2 of this petition, is an agreement concluded with Shaikh Mubarak as Subah, the bequeather of the appellants, which contains a provision making it applicable to him and to his heirs. The acceptance of the Basrah Court of First Instance of a case against the head of an independent Government in spite of his objection to it, is contrary to Law and its judgment is liable to be reversed.(2) The hearing of the oase, the whereof has been appealed from, is outside the jurisdiction of the Court as the British Government, on 3/11/1914, concluded a treaty with Shailch Mubarak as Subah, the bequeather of the appellants contain/a clear undertaking by the British Government to protect the properties of Shaikh Mubarak as Sabah and his successors in Iraq which were under their disposal when the said treaty was ratified* It is as promises concerning your good self from the High Government, under your control; the date gardens situated between Fao and Qurna will remain under your and your successors f control* of First Instance. Therefore, the High British Government is the guarantor of the Emirate of Kuwait and particularly of the family of His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait, Mubarak as Subah, his sons and grandsons in respect of their properties situated in the Vilayat of Basra. According to the terms of General International Law, the guaranteeing Government has right to interfere if any other Government, through its legal authorities, attempts to touch that which the Government has guaranteed. If we admit this, the dispute in this case would then, in fact, be between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq, which may be considered as having power to protect the rights of her subjects who live under her aegis* If we say so, it would be necessary for us to refer to the Treaties which settled matters between Britain and Iraq* On 30/7/30 a treaty was concluded between the British Government and Iraq. The Iraqi Government, at article 9 of the Treaty, undertook not to injure the existing undertakings and previl€ges, which may exist/ in respect of the British Government, provided such ing v follows word by word?** Moreover, you demanded certain namely (1) ( ) which is at present I submitted a certified copy of this text to the Court noundertakings do not oppose the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Prevention of War signed at Paris. This is the text of Article 9 in question. 'This Treaty does not contain anything which might, in any way, injure the existing rights and undertakings or those that may exist for or against any of the two Contracting Parties in accordance with the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaty for the Prevention of War signed at Paris on 37/8/1929'. As the properties,for the cancellation of whose documents a case has been filed, were in my clients' possession on the date of the ratification of the Treaty, as admitted by the Respondent himself, it is undoubtedly one of the undertakings given by Britain to someone else prior to the ratification of the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Britain as also it is one of the undertakings which Iraq undertook not to injure, as the Iraqi Treaty is a law which the Iraqi Courts should act upon. It may be said that the present case is in connection with a private property in Basra owned by H.H.Sfeaikh Ahmad as Subah, the Ajuir of Kuwait, in his private capacity. This statement is incorrect, as H.H.The Shaikh of Kuwait is the Head of a State. Should he go to another State and own property there, his official designation cannot detach from him. On thl other hand, the undertaking of Britain to the Head of the Kuwait State in regard to his properties in Basrah cannot be regarded as an ordinary matter, but it is purely an international matter. Therefore, to disregard this defence and to hear the case in spite of the existence of this undertaking binding the Government and people of Iraq is against law and should be cancelled. ( 3 ) Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty clearly says as follows. 'Should any misunderstanding take placein regard to its application or interpretation and the two Contracting Parties have not been able to arrive at a settlement between themselves by direct negotiation, the difference is to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Covenant of the League of Nations. w No doubt, in view of the adherence to this defence of my clients who are the Heads and Members of the Ruling Family of a Foreign State, it is incumbent on the ordinary Courts to desist from settling the dispute in the ordinary way, and should ask those concerned to approach the Irat j. Grovernment for addressing the Chief of the Kuwait State or the British Government in a diplomatic way. Therefore, to disregard this point and to proceed with the case in the ordinary manner is contrary to law and should be cancelled. (4) This case is to be rejected for another reason,i.e., the properties In dispute belong to the appellants - my olients- and have been under their control since 15 years and more, with which they have been dealing without any objection. This their disposal is based on formal Tapu Document issued from a competent authority and by the order of a competent official. The plaintiff - Abdullah az Zuhair himself was present in Basrah all that time and was witnessing the appellants dealing with these properties. Also his beaueatheress, who is said to be the owner of these properties haa numerous agents, out of whom/were lawyers licenced to practise, and others were distinguished personalities who exercised influence in this country. The bequeatheress actually filed a number of cases in the Basra Courts and was represented by a number of lawyers on the strength of general powers of attorney. She was n.t in an isolated town distant from Iraq and she was quite aware that my clients - the appellants - were disposing these properties treely. Mor.o.er, st. dll »■&gt;* »«*»“ d 1 * 1 ' until the tl». ot her de.th. Th.r.rore, mils of •-9- after tlie expiry of the recognized period of limitation, is contrary to the terms of Article 1660 of al Majallah Code. The reply given by plaintiff’s agent - the present Respondent - on this point was (1) that 'There was an admission by me that these properties were owned by Awwashah az Zuhair.' This is against fact. If your Honourable Court examined all my plaints and petitions, they would not come across any admission in respect of the ownership of those properties by Ayeshah az Zuhair. I believe that the Respondent wants to obtain such an admission out of my statement that my clients owned these properties in a legitimate way from the bequeatheress of the plaintiff many years prior to the expiry of the period of limitation. The difference between the two versions is not indistinct. Article 1674 of Liajaxlah Code, on which the Respondent relied, is clear and goes against his contention. The admission that invalidates the limitation, in view of the rat clarity of the article in question, is the admission regarding existence of rights for the plaintiff against the defendant at the time of admission. This is the text of Article 1674 in question. 'No claim will drop by reasons of limitation. Therefore, if the defendant makes a clear aomission before the Judge that he owed the plaintiff at that time in a time-barred case, as claimed by the plaintiff, the time limitation is not to be considered, and judgment is to be given on the admission of the defendant.' The Commentators of the Majallah considered this a precautionar binding. The late Selim Bazqi, who made comments on the Majallah, said as follows. 'The phrase 'at present’ is a precautionary binding and is construed to mean that the admission of the defendant does not Invalidate the limitation of time unless he admitted his indebtedness until the present time. For Instance, if one claims property from another sayihg that he owned it or inherited it from his father andthe defendant replied that he bought it from his(plaintiff’s) father and uncle from whom he(plaintiff)inherited such and such thing , and that the property has been in hisldefendant T s) possession since 40 years, it needs no proofHe further said, 'If he(defendant)did not admit the property at that time, his admission does not invalidate time limitation*' No one of us made any confession to the Respondent or to the bequeather of the insane, who is under his guardianship, regarding the existence of any right for anybody to these properties* The whole of my defence is a total denial of any right which the plaintiff claims to these properties which were registered and owned by my clients who have been disposing of them freely and without any hindrance for a period more than the recognized period of limitation* Then where is the admission on which the Respondent relies? (2) That his client was absent and that the absence debars time limitation. This statement is to be rejected too. The absence that debars time limitation under Article 166.} and 1664 of A1 Majallah Code is the absence which does not enable the absentee to claim his right through an attorney, such as being in confinment or in a place having no means of communication with the place at which the case is to be filed or confined in a quarantine on account of epidemics etcetera. This is clear from Article 1663 of A1 Majallah Code. The said article quoted various decisions about minors and absentees. It is said that time limitation does not apply to minors at all and more definitely declared that time limitation is not applicable to minors whether they have guardians or not, but in the case of the absentees, it is legally applicable to their representatives. The object of these two different rulings is that the case of an absentee is different from that of disability. In the case of disability it makes no difference whether there is a representative or not, but in the case of the existence of an attorney, who may either be an absentee-li es 'that the right came to him through her', had access to her properties in Basra and had numerous formal attorneys there who held general and legal powers of attorney from her, and she had filed several cases in Basra through them. Therefore, the action of the Court by disregarding the above and issuing an order for the cancellation of the Tapu Documents on the authority of the alleged admission, is * V 1 against law and should ha sat aside. (5) As regards the contention of the Respodent that defence about time limitation in respect of a Royal Document (Sanad KhaqaniUs not to be heard. He could not substantiate this opinion by quoting any provision of law. Article 1660 of A1 Majallah Code clearly defines that cases about properties, estates and inheritances cannot be entertained after 15 years. We have no other law amending this article. ? This article is in general terms and stands as it is. It is incredible that your honourable Court should pass such an order which is contrary to law. The agent of the Respondent mentioned this point and alleged that many similar decisions were passed by your court but he neither produced nor/ a were passed by your reference to any such decision. The only decision which he reference to any such decision. The only decision which he from this one, as my clients* disposal from this one, as my clients* disposalproduced in Case No.77 of 1930 referred to above except a sale deed executed outside the Tapu Department, and no question * was raised regarding possession by limitation period. One of the cases, Nos.73/1921, 119 and 155, was between partners. Your honourable Court decided at that time that disposal by a partner is not subject to limitation. This case is,however, quite different from that one. The other two decisions were to the effect that no personal evidence is to be heard for the cancellation of formal documents. I did not ask for personal proof of my clients’ disposal of this property, but my defence is supported by a Tapu document recogized by my apponent. Where is the resemblance between the two cases? It would, therefore, appear to your honourable Court that the Respondent wants to benefit from judgments passed by your Court in cases quite unlike this one. This is not admissible. On the contrary I have come across several decisions passed by your honourable Court accepting defence on a question involving time limitation d&gt;n respect of disposal of an immovable property registered in a document. One of the decisions in question is the one issued under No.251/1925 and published in A1 Majallah al Adliyah (Law Gamette), Part XIII, 2nd Year, page 10, which runs as follows*- 'No defence about disposal after the period of limitation will be beard in respect of property registered in a reliable document unless defence about tbe expiry of the period of limitation depends on any of the authorities of ownership on the strength of a written document.' Is there any written document more authentic than a sanad issued by an official department? Another decision issued in Case No.597/1936 and published in Parts 3 &amp; 4 of the Law Gazette, 2nd Year, is as follows:- 'If the plaintiff filed a claim asking that the-13- defendant be prevented from raising any objection in respect of a house belonging to her and admitted that he had taken it from her by force 18 years ago and included it in his own house, it is necessary that her case should be rejected, as this period is above the period of limitation. w There are other decisions which we need not quote as they are better known to your honourable Court. It would, therefore, appear to your court that the defence of the Respondent which was heard by the Court of First Instance, is against law and should be set aside. (6) The case, as defined by article 1613 of A1 Majallah, is a claim submitted by one person against another. There should exist a condition that the thing claimed is a right of the claimant. The plaintiff in this case entangled his case with tha estate of Ayesha az zuhair which was transferred to the plaintiff, Abdullah az Zuhair, without the existence of any right of a claim to these properties as, according to the Share’ division, Ayesha died on 21/10/1931 and the plaintiff - the Respondent - admits that we have been possessing these properties ainoe 15th August 1915 on the authority of the documents produced. The right of putting a claim is, therefore, ijuashed. Ayesha az Zuhair was alive and her estate was transferred to the plaintiff. Therefore, the right of putting a claim did not exist in respect of this estate. The result is that this case was filed by a person not entitled to do so legally. The action of the Court of First Instance in disregarding this point and passing an order nullifying the Tapu documents, is against law and should be set aside. (7) If we took it for granted that the Appellate Court, in other cases, nullifies documents in respect of immovable properties executed outside the Tapu Department, those findings, according to principle, cannot form a basis for judgment in this case. If we leave Judgments of the14- A$pellate Gourlj aside and refer lo the Law applied in this Country we do not find a single Law annulling sale deeds executed outside the Tapu Department. All what is there, as is evident from certain Appellate Cpurt decisions, is that they relied on Article 1 of the Law Concerning Disposal of Immovable Properties. If we were to examine this Article carefully, we would not find it to apply to pure properties, but it concerns State and Waqf lands only. The sentence, n And as disposal without a document is not admissible, so the hearing is not admissible too etc.7 may be interpreted to concern disposal of pure properties, but this interpretation is wrong, as the disposal to which this Article refers is ’defined disposal’ which was referred to above,i.e., State and Waqf lands. Some decisions are based on the High Decree(Iradah)issued on 10th September 1318. I searched Cor a text of this Decree but could not get it. I, however, got a copy of the instructions issued by the Ministry of Interior to the Vilayats putting this Decree into operation. On going through it^ I found that it did not annul deeds but it prevents hearing of cases. No doubt there is a great difference between hearing of a case and annulment of deeds. As we were not claimants in this case, the provisions of this Decree are not applicable to us as they have no legal strength. If we admit this point and take up the question of how my clients possessed and dealt with these properties, we will find that they owned them by a legal and authentic deed dated 21st Muharram 1327 given by the Agent-General authorised to execute the said deed on the authority of a genuine and formal power of attorney. W e will also find that he was approached in due course about the registration of the property in the Tapu Department and the Ministry approved the registration as can be seen from the letter of the Vali of Basrah Vilayat submitted with the papers of First Instance case. While arrangements were being made for the registration, Basrah was occupied by the British Forces and the Controller of Finance of the Expeditionary Force issued orders for the registration of the property in-15- quest Ion In the Tapu records, which was done. No doubt the British Government, when occupying Basrah, was an Invading Government entitled to organize the affairs in the territories that fell under their control according to their own desires. The General Officer Commanding.the Kxpeditionary Forces issued a circular in August 1915 titled 'Law for the Occupied Territory of Iraq'. Part 6, item 47 of this Law, under the heading ••Miscellaneous Items', is as follows:- 'Courts established under this Law do not apply the Ottoman Penal and Civil Procedure Codes and what relates to statements of law'. In view of this, the officials of the Expeditionary Force were not using their power according to law but were acting on instructions received from the General Officer Commanding or his representative. The Tapu officials in Basrah received written instructions from the Finance Officer (Sir Henry Dobbs) to register these properties in the name df the sons of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait which was done. This act of Sir Henry Dobbs is a legal one at that time as a declaration was issued confirming similar acts performed by Sir Henry Dobbs. The declaration in question is No.32 dated June 1919, and from its text it would be implied that prior to its promulgation, this duty was performed by the said Controller of Finance. The formalities under which the properties were registered in the name of my clients do not &lt; -m rm of sale deeds executed when the Tapu differ from registration or saxe Departments were closed on account of the occupation, and such formalities were considered by the said declaration of 1919 and Law made by the Iraqi Government in 1932 as proper and the properties have to be registered in the Tapu Department without the presence of the parties but simply on the attestation of the Political Officer. It would appear to your honourable Court that sale deeds executed outside the Tapu Department are not null and void but, as said by the Egyptian Court of Revision, would remain as they are until after registration and would not concern anyone not a party to the transaction. As for parties, V !■ v-16- they are considered to be genuine and valid deeds like other genuine deeds. (8) The Tapu documents which are in my clients* possession were issued under the written order of the Controller of Finance (Sir Henry Dobbs)during the Military occupation of Basara by the British. No doubt the officials of the invading Government carried out their duties properly. The authors agreed to the genuinness of the functions of the conquering power, Ustad Ahmad Nasha’t Bey, Lawmaster in the Law School of Egypt, states in his Book *Hisalat-al-Ithbat* as foliows:- 'If the legitimate Government was overpowered and the conquering power appointed an official, the written instructions of such an official are considered to be legal as he is in fact an official ♦ If we say that his actions are illegitimate, this would cause the public interests to be delayed and the works stopped, as there is no one else to perform the duties. Jf they wrote documents containing civil rights for or against the public, they should be accepted. - No doubt it is in the public and special interest that such papers and documents be regarded as official.** According to the Shara* of ZjbxxZ Islam, judgments passed by a Qadhi appointed by a conquering power are acceptable. This opinion is also upheld by the English author, Goodnow in his book ^Contemporary Law of Administration** , Part 2, page 25, under the Heading 'Office Defects'. (9) This case is also subject to Indian Limitation Act. The Tapu documents on the authority of which my clients have been dealing with the said properties, were given to them under Order No.504 of 14th June 1915 from the Inspector of Finance(Sir Henry Dobbs)who was acting for the General Officer Commanding in the administration of the Finance of the country. The Tapu Department was one of the departments under his purview. Therefore, the order passed by Sir Henry Dobbs is an order passed by a♦competent Grovernment servant as far as his duties were concerned^. The Indian Limitation Act specified one year as the period during which one can file a case for the cancellation of such an order, as is clear from item 14, Article 1, Part 1 of the Indian Limitation Act. In view of this, the right of raising an objection against the campetemt Grover-nment servant ceased on 14th June 1916 on which date the Indian Limitation Act was still applicable in Basrah. In view of the clarity of ♦♦Regulation for the Cancellation of Laws n , the period cannot be extended and, accordingly, the right of putting up a claim in this case has elapsed. Therefore, the action of the Court of First Instance of Basrah in disregarding this point is deliberately against law and the judgment should be set aside. In view of the above and to the petitions which I submitted to the Court of First Instance and the reasons that I will put up before your honourable Court, it will be clear to your Court that the judgment appealed from is contrary to law in several respects and liable to be^ set aside* I repeat my request for setting it aside and rejecting the Respondent!s (Plaintiffs) claim and making him bear all Court Fees of First Instance and Appellate Courts, advocate fees for conducting both the First Instance and appeal &lt;ses, fees for preparing the petitions and travelling expenses. The order rests with you. Sd. Advocate Abdul Jail}. Partu Attorney of the Appellants.Telegram - Q, From - Political Agent, Kuwait To - Political Resident, Fushire.

I send you herewith translations, as well as the original, of the Kaimakam of Ahul Khaslb's demand note for £.19,480 dinars 900 fils from the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak. 2, This method of demanding a large sum of the money, on a little huff form, filled-in in pencil, is, I believe, even more insulting in Arab eyes than in ours. 3 , Moreover, the demand is directly contrary to our recent understanding with the Ira&lt;i Government. Description of the Estates which were to be attached, and the method of the calculation of the taxes which were claimed, are omitted from the demand note, but as has been reported to you by telegram, before the ten days was ended, the complete Eao ^.nd IPaddaghiya estates were seized by the Mudir of Eao, on behalf of the Iraa Government. The tenants were evicted and others installed, and according to the Shaikh’s evicted sub-agent from Eao, the Mudir immediately announced that he would welcome offers of purchase. 4 , j ho not know what action His Majesty’s Government will take, but, in view of our 1914 promise, if the two estates (Signature) are/ S. 44.

KABIR has never conducted case. He was merely consulted by PARTU on point of procedure and never appeared in Court as leader. Best course therefore seems to me to be that Shaikh should now ask PARTU to hand over case to another lawyer who could (come to?) Baghdad for hearing of new appeal. He ( Mutilated) can consult K.ABIR here I do not think that conscription of PARTU is necessari ly malicious.

He, however, said that the absence of Daud Samra does not matter as there are other judges on the Court and it was possible to hear the case if the President knew that I was present. I wanted to go to the President and ask him to Hear the case but I thought the matter over and found that my appeal was based on a legal opinion written by Daud Sanra in his book and we could catch him on this point should he be hearing the case. But if he is not present the other judges may not bind themselves with the opinion of Daud Samra which he wrote in his book. I, therefore, agreed to the postponement of the case and asked the clerk to inform the Head-master of the Military School about the summons. I then went to see Captain Holt but could not find him in his place. I left him a note, giving him my address and asked him to send for me if he so wished. On the 2nd day I received a message from him at the school asking me to go and see him on Wednesday at 6 P.M. At the exact time I reached the Embassy where I met him and had a long talk with him on the subject. He asked me whether it was necessary for another lawyer such as Yusuf al Kebir to join me. I replied that I was quite agreable to that. I actually spoke to Yusuf al Kebir but he refused to do so in the beginning. Then he promised to do so^but was not definite. I requested him( Captain Holt)to get into touch with him and rejjuest him to joi# me in fighting out the case. He promised to do so. I then left him.

Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, K.C.I. c.s.I.’, Huler' of Kuwait• After Corapiiiaents. x forward herewith a co Py of a letter sent by the British Embassy, Baghdad, to Advocate Abdul Jalil Bartu, in which they stated that Advocate Yusuf al Kebir has declined to appear on the day of hearing, but that he agreed to act as a legal aaviser for this case. The ^bassy asked Advocate Abdul Jalil to engage another lawyer to help him in conducting this case, and that both of them should appear on the day of ^ hearing, as Advocate Abdul Jalil might perhaps be prevented by some unforeseen event from attending on that day. The case is now subject to two courses. The first is that Advocate • Abdul Jalil should conduct the case alone, and, if this course ia to be adopted Abdul Jalil requests that I should write him a letter In that sense, and that he need not appoint another lawyer. The second course is that another lawyer should j oln Abdul Jalil m which case he asked me to pay such . lawyer not less than 150 dinars out of which 50 dinars are to be paid in advance and the balance, 100 dinars after the case succeeds, and that the 50 dinars may be remitted to him, and for the balance we execute a written undertaking. In case we agreed to this course, he wants me to send him a letter authorising him to engage another lawyer who can conduct the case. As the decision rests with you, I have reported the matter to you with the request that you may pass orders on the subject as early as may be possible, though by wire, as tine is very short# Usual ending.Translation or letter dated 8th Rabi el i^wwral 1358(27-4-39) from ohaiKh Muhamruad al Ahmad as-oubah, iimaxikxx^Basrah # to H.H.Shaikh Sir Ahmad al Jabir as-Subeh, K.C.I. , c.3*I. f Ruler of Kuwait. After Compliments, At y.00 A.L. the British Consul askeu me on telephone to go and see him. X went to him and the following conversation took place between us. He said, 'I called on the Mutasarrif yesterday and spoke to him about the question of the seizure (of the date- gardens). He apologized and said it was not a real seizure but a nominal one, that it was carried out as some Basrah people owed the Government Miri taxes and Baaal kithi, and that everyone was saying why did the Government not recover their dues from the shaikh of Kuwait. I n order to stop the people from saying so, he caused a nominal, and not a real, seizure to be made. That the Government have no intention of disposing of the property, and that there is no objection now if as-oubah agents returned to their properties provided that every agent is in possession of a certificate duly attested by the Kotary Public, Basrah t n The Consul added,'The ^utasari ii said that he presumed that even kuhaiamad son of Shaikh Ahmad was not in possession of a power of attorney.' I replied the Consul that X had a power of attorney from my father. He thought it desirable if both of us went together to the Uutasarrif. Then he sain it would be better if I go alone and show him the power of attorney, ^fter leaving the consul X called on the liutasarrif and showed him the power of attorney but he was displeased with the phrase, this power of attorney does not empower hKi to accept service. The said agent,Muhammad, is not allowed to accept service on my behalf in respect of the suits and cases that may be filed against me in the Courts,or judgments and legal documents passed against me.'Whila I was speaking with the Mutasarrif at his office, the Consul came to visit the liutasarrif ana there was a lengthy conversation between them. The Mutasarrif asked the Consul to read the power of attorney and said to him, 'Is it proper for him to file cases and recover his dues from the Iraqis, whereas the Iraqis are not entitled to sue him as his son is not authorised to accept service?' He requested the Consul to write to the *abassy about this matter. *hcn the Consul asked him how they brought in new farmers and evicted as-bubah farmers, the Mutasarrif said that he would turn out anyone xh against whom we have a Court judgment. Then the Consul said, 'lihat about the others?' The Mutasarrif began quibbling and giving out of the way replies about the others• The result is that he did not give us a satisfactory answer about the other farmers. Then the Consul asked him why they prevented as-Hubsh agent from collecting rents of shops and houses in j’ao. He said he thought he was prevented from doing so, as he Uau no formal power of attorney. This Mutasarrif will give us much trouble by his quibbles. The Mutasarrif told the Consul that the shaikh of Kuwait had no Tapu documents for ail his properties. Later on all of us agreed as follows:- I should prepare a power of attorney for the ?ao agent empowering him to deal with the properties and collect rents, and another power of attorney for the iTaddaghiyah agent empowering him to deal with the properties, and get both of them attested by the Notary Public. Afterwards I should take them to the Mutasarrif, get a letter from him to the qaimmakam of Abul Khasib who will give me a letter to the Mudir of Fao Nahiya. I will inform the Consul of further developments# Usual dndiug.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000064_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/150</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000064</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/150</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2/5 XI 'SHAIKH'S DATE GARDENS'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-20T11:18:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (260 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the front to the rear of the volume.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 262; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
