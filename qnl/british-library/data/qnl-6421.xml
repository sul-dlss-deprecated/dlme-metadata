Th© French Envoy was profuse in his promises of aid, brought with him several Officers to drill the Persian soldiery, and for a time obtained great influence at the Court of the Shah. Markham's Persia, Jt was with the view of counteracting this French P* 371 - influence that the British Government, both in London and Calcutta, were induced to send missions to the Court of Persia, and in 1808 Sir J. Malcolm was despatched thither by Lord Minto ; owing, how ever, to the power of the French at Teheran, he was unable at first to advance beyond Bushire. Almost at the same time. Sir Harford Jones left England on the same errand, and succeeded in reaching the Persian capital in the beginning of 1809. The Peace of Tilsit had been concluded in the interval, and thfe French were no longer able to promise aid against the Russians, consequently General Gar danne received his dismissal from Teheran a few days before Sir Harford Jones entered it. On the retirement of Sir H. Jones in 1810, Sir John Malcolm visited the Persian Court and was ac companied by several British Officers, who were em ployed during the war, which was still lingering on between Persia and Russia,, in the task of disciplining the Persian soldiery. Among them we find the well- known names of Majors D'Arcy and Stone, Captain Christie, and Lieutenants Lindsay, Monteith, and Markham 'sPersia, Willock.

It may be stated that in the draft of this Treaty, as arranged by Sir Gore Ouseley, but which was altered in England, was an article that the King of Persia's allowance per annum to the different ranks of Officers, Sergeants, &amp;c. engaged in disciplining the Shah's army was to be as follows:— Lieut.-General - Major Brigadier - Engineers.

This article was subse quently virtually annulled by an agreement con cluded between Sir J. Campbell and Prince Abbass Meerza, by which the latter engaged to employ none but British Officers.* An overture from Russia at about this time, offering to send Officers to Persia, however, met with a categorical refusal. There were no considerable number of British Officersf in the camp of the Shah after 1812, until the year 1833, when several commissioned and non-commissioned Officers arrived in Persia (in cluding Sheil, Farrant, Rawjinson, and Todd), under the command of Colonel Pasmore. The Biitish detachment was placed on the following footing, viz., one Commandant, a Second in com- inana, au Adjutant, an Officer of Artillery, an Officei ot Engineers, a Medical Officer, J and two Sergeants from each branch of tl^e army. They were soon joined by Sir Henry Bethune (the Lieu tenant Lindsay of former days), and were employed in disciplining the troops and restoring order. In cluding Sir H. Bethune and a Medical Officer thev were twelye in number, with different allowances, the east of which was Rs. 500 a month, consoli- dated Indian pay, exclusive of Persian staff pay.

This took place in 1H38, under Mr. McNeil's orders, when, in conse quence of the attitude assumed by Persia towards Herat and Affghanistan, he broke off diplomatic relations with the Court of the Shah. They appear to have left in arrears of pay, which was subse quently granted them at the peremptory demand of the British Government. Since that date no British Officers in the Government service have been similarly employed. About this time, a discussion took place as to the payment of the Officers attached to the Mission in Persia. The East India Company contended that the expenses of their maintenance should be de frayed out of the 12,000/. a year which they had consented to pay towards the expenses of the British Mission in Persia on its transfer to the Imperial Government. Ultimately they agreed to pay the charge* for one year, on the understanding that an endeavour should be used to obtain from the Shah of Persia reimbursement thereof. This arrangement was further continued for another year from the expiration of the above period; the records do not appear to state what happened after this. In the instructions given to Sir Henry Rawlinson on his appointment as British Minister at Teheran in 1859, his attention was directed to the influence of French Officers established in Persia, and the .advantage which would be derived if English Officers could be substituted for them. Writing to the Foreign Office on the subject on the 27th April 1860 (No. 72), he stated that the Shah was very anxious for such an alteration. Austrian, Italian, and French Officers had all been tried without any favourable result, chiefly owing to their taking little interest in their work. The Shah pro posed that 40 British Officers should be substituted for them, to whose management a force of 10,000 men should be assigned, and that the British Government should furnish a sum of about 100,000/, a year for the maintenance of the Contingent. With regard to the effect upon Russia of such an arrangement, both the Shah and his Ministers stated that they must expect the displeasure ot that Power • but as no infraction of Treaty stipulations would be incurred, her ill-humour could only be expended in hard words and sullen looks. Sir H. Rawlinson expressed himself as favourably disposed to entertain the proposal of the Persian Government, particularly as the bargain would made terminable either in three or five y ear . s - ^ the same time he pointed out certain objections to the carrying out of the plan, particularly the difficulty of dealing with the corrupt and gree y officials of the Persian Government, who would 16029.

He, however, considered that the money would be well laid out if it even ^ 110 further result than committing Persia thoroughly to the English alliance;—and if the formation 01 the Contingent really confirmed the independence^ Persia, and constituted an effective barrier agamst the further extension of Russian power towards India, he thought that it would be the greatest political object that was ever achieved at so lit e expense. As a mere abstract question of expe diency, he considered that it would be to ,the advantage of Great Britain to see such a Contingent Established in Persia. In these views, however. Her Majesty's Govern ment did not concur, and some of th^ reasons stated by Sir H. Rawlinson against the proposed Contingent and subsidy were considered as decisive. In the event of any aggression by Bussia, Mr. Alison, who had succeeded Sir H. Rawlinson at Teheran (the Persian Mission having been transferred to the Imperial Government), was informed that Her Majesty's Government would greatly prefer sending a subsidiary force from India to support Persia, to paying a subsidy in time of peace. Such a force, it was observed, would be, in regard to pay, dis cipline, and premotion, under the control of Her Majesty's Government, and would only be employed when wanted. The Shah, Mr. Alison was informed, might always rely on the friendly disposition of the British Government, but the proposed grant of a subsidy could not be entertained. On the 5th January 1863, the subject was revived by Mr. Eastwick, then acting as Charge d'Affaires at Teheran, in a letter to the Foreign Office, ' in which he stated that the Shah was extremely dissatisfied with the present instructors of his army, and desired to return to the old systerh, under which the Indian Government lent him a certain number of Military Officers to drill and discipline his troops. Mr. Eastvvick, thinking it a favourable time for complying with the Shah^s request, recommended that four Officers should be despatched for the purpose, who should receive, in addition to their regular Indian pay and allowances, about 180/. a year as field allowance, if below the rank of Major, and, if Majors, double that amount. Lord Russell, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in forwarding Mr. Eastwick's proposal to the India Office on 20th February 1863, stated that he was inclined to coincide in opinion with Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires as to the advantage to be derived from a compliance with the wishes of the Government of Persia. He accordingly invited Sir C. Wood's consideration to the subject, with the view of determining whether the measure of employing Officers of the Indian Army in the proposed service could be effected without incon venience oi objection. In commenting on Mr. Eastwick's proposal, Mr. (now Sir J.) Ka^e remarked that ' of the ad- To Mr. Alison, No. 46, 3rd July 1860. Note.

The Secretary of State for India stated to the t^reign Office, in reply to their reference, that he had no objection to the employment of such Officers as might volunteer for the service, and might be approved by the Government of India, to whom, accordingly, the necessary instructions would be sent for the furtherance of this object; at the same time it was pointed out that Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran should communicate the wishes of the Shah to the Viceroy of India, together with the proposed terms of service, with reference to pay, rank, and the nature of their employment. Sir G.Wood expressed his willingness to defray from the Indian Exchequer the ordinary pay and allowances of the Officers, while all extraordinary allowances should be paid by the Government of the Shah, it being left to the Officers themselves to decide whether the advantages held out to them would be sufficient to induce them to volunteer, the Govern ment of India, of course, determining what Officers could be spared for the service. Finally, it was to be clearly explained to the Shah's Government that any British Officers placed at their disposal were on no account to be employed against the allies of the British Government, who reserved the right of recalling them whenever circumstances might dictate such a course. The purport of the above was communicated by the Foreign Office to Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran on 8th April 1863. In fulfilment of the promise contained in the India Office Letter of 4th April 1863, instructions were sent to the Viceroy ot India that, after receiving a communication on the subject from Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran, he should take such steps as might seem expedient to meet the wishes of the Shah, if there should be no special circumstances to render unadvisable the adoption of the proposed measure. To this the Governor General of India (Lord Elgin) replied that he saw no objection to the employment of British Officers in Persia in the manner suggested; on the contrary, he thought the measure would be attended with advantage. He added, however, that it jvaB obvious that Officers employed in such service should be men of steady character and good judgment, as well as nnlitaiy competence; he feared that the allowances olfeief8 by the Shah were not sufficient to induce Officers so qualified to give up even temporarily their Indian prospects for service in Persia. He promised, how ever, to make further inquiries. Copy of this letter was forwarded to the Foreign Office on 24th August 1863. Shortly after this Lord Elgin forwarded copy of Letter from India a memorandum by the Secretary to Government in ^ed ^sth July the Military Department, showing that, unless a 186 3 higher rate of pay were to be given by the Persian Government, it would be impossible to secure the services of Officers of the Indian Army of sufficient standing and experience for the performance of duties of so delicate a nature as those which would devolve on them if employed in the army of the Shah. Copy of this letter was forwarded to the Foreign Office on 9th September 1863. Meanwhile the Foreign Office had stated that Letter from the Secretary of State for War considered that ^creu ^ti advantages would be gained by the employment by septal863. the Shah of Persia of British Officers to instruct his army, but that the Officers should be obtained from India, great care being exercised in their selection. We now pass on to 1868, when Sir H. Rawlinson See Letters from wrote the elaborate memorandum on Central Asia, Vs69 ^ suggesting, amongst other things, that Officers should be sent to drill the Shah's Army. Copy of this was duly forwarded to the Government of India (on 24th August 1868), and elicited a variety of opinions, extracts of which are given in Appendix B. (Letter from India, No. 1,4th January 1869.) In the former year (1868) also, the Persian Charge d'Affaires Letter from at this Court expressed to the Secretary of State for ^ ore j^ Foreign Affairs the wish of his Government that jggg n ' uy Military Officers should be sent to organize and direct the Persian Army, whereupon the Foreign Office invited the attention of the India Office to the subject. Sir S. Northcote in reply referred to the Letter to Foreign correspondence from India, enclosed in the India Office, dated 21st Office letters of 24th August and 9th September ' u y 1 8 * 1863, adding, that he had a strong sense of the importance, in the then state of affairs, of affording the Shah the opportunity which he sought of im parting, through the agency of English Officers, better military organization to his troops; but he was of opinion at the same time that the Officers selected for such service should be men of proved efficiency, or, in the case of the lower grades, of high .promise. It could not reasonably be expected that men would abandon their prospects in India unless the allowances attached to the Persian In- structorships were fixed upon a liberal scale. In furtherance of such an object, the Secretary of State for India expressed himself as willing to grant from the Indian revenues the ordinary pay and allowances of a certain number of Officers whilst employed with the Persian Army, leaving it to the Government of the Shah to fix such an additionalLetter from Foreign Office, dated 23rd July 1868.

This decision was com municated by the Foreign Office to Her Majesty's Minister at Teheran on 23rd of the same month On the 6th October that Officer telegraphed to the roreign Office that the Persian Government re- qiured a Colonel and about 15 Commissioned and Non-Commissioned Officers. Mr. Alison at the same time inquired what scale of allowances would be deemed sufficient for them ? The matter was referred to the India Office. While it was under consideration, Mr. Alison again telegraphed to the Loi eign Office to the effect that it would greatly en hance their position were they paid entirely by the- British Government. The opinions of Sir H. Raw- linson, Mr, Kaye, and Sir R. Montgomery, who were consulted in the matter, will be found in extenso in Appendix C. It will suffice to say they all agreed as to the expediency of meeting the Shah's wishes as far as possible. Sir S. Northcote, however, did not feel disposed to lay such a charge on the Indian revenues. Accordingly, he consulted his Council on the matter. The result was a letter to the Foreign Office in the following terms :— ' I am directed by Sir S. Northcote to state, for the informa tion of Lord Stanley, that he has had under his deliberate con sideration in Council your letters of the 6th, 7th, and 30th of October relating to the expediency of appointing certain Officers of the Indian Army to instruct and to organise the military forces of the Shah of Persia, and to the circumstances and conditions of such appointments. ' With reference to these important questions I am instructed to state that Sir S. Northcote is of opinion that it would be advisable, in the present state of our relations with Persia, to revert to a system which, from the commencement of the century up to the year 1839, was observed with good results, and which was suspended only in consequence of a temporary rupture with the Persian Court. But it is necessary that the Officers selected for this service should in every respect be qualified for the pecu liar duties which they will be called upon to perform, and it cannot be expected that Officers who have good professional prospects in India will abandon them for an employment which, however inviting in some respects, must be more or less pre carious, without sufficient inducement being held out to them in the shape of superior emoluments. ' The question then is whether, in the event of duly qualified Officers being willing to undertake this especial duty, the addi tional allowances which must be granted to them should be paid out of the Treasury of the Indian Government or disbursed by the Shah of Persia. Mr. Alison states that 4 it would greatly * enhance their position and influence if they were paid entirely ♦ by the British Government.' It is possible, however, on the other hand, with reference to the position of other European Courts represented by their Ministers at Teheran, that some political embarrassment might arise from such decided action upon our part as would be suggested by the entire payment by ourselves of our Officers in Persia. _ Upon this point Lord Stanley must have the best means at his disposal for forming a correct opinion. I am desired, however, to acquaint you that the Secretary of State for India in Council is willing to sanction the employment of a certain number of Indian Officers in the manner suggested, and to pay them from the Indian Treasury a consoli dated allowance, on the scale of the arrangement sanctioned with reference to the establishment under Colonel Pasmore, but that, in the opinion of Sir S. Northcote, it is desirable that some addi tional allowances should be granted by the Shah, of such a kin 16029. C10 I as could not incooveolence His magnitude of the demand. Si • , j tt f the 2l8t modify the Tiews orpre^d m ^rd Ckntoa lotWr ^ ■s: r satr-ssi fi., ^ matter for future consideration. «I am directed to add that, if Lord Stanley concurs in these views Sir S. Northcote will lose no time in addressing vernment of India in order that immediate steps may be take give them effect.' Lord Stanley replied, on behali of the Foreign Office, that he was clearly of opin ,on t . hat ., a portion of their pay should be defrayed Persian Government; he therefore suggested that Sir S. Northcote should determine what should be the sum to be assigned by the Persian Govern ment to each Officer and instructor according to his rank. Lord Stanley then promised, when informed of this decision, to instruct Mr. Alison to state to the Persian Government that, on their signifying the Shah's concurrence, and engaging that the Persian pay should be regularly placed at the disposal of Her Majesty's mission at stated periods, so as to admit of its being punctually issued when due, arrangements would forthwith be made for sending the party from India to Teheran. Meanwhile there was a change of Ministry in this country, and Sir S. Northcote desired to leave the matter to be settled by his successor, consequently no replv was sent to the above letter till 5th March 1869, when the Duke of Argyll expressed his views as follows:— ' With reference to previous correspondence &lt;c on the subject of the renewed expression of ' the Government of Persia to entertain the ser- ' vices of a certain number of Officers of Her ' Majesty's Indian Army, with a view to the &lt;c organization and discipline of the forces of the ' Shah, I am instructed by the Duke of Argyll to ' state that the subject having again been under ' the consideration of Her Majesty's Government, ' and it having been deemed advisable that the &lt;c request of the Shah should not be refused, he has iS considered the question submitted to the Secretary ' of State for India, in the Foreign Office letter of ' the 21st November last, respecting the strength &lt;c of the proposed establishment of British Officers, ' and the amount of pay and allowances which &lt;c they should receive from the Government of the ' Shah. ' I am now directed to state, for the information ' of Lord Clarendon, that the Duke of Argyll is of ' opinion that the following is the strength of the a establishment of British Officers required to give u effect to the wishes of the Shah, and that the ' local pay to be received from the Persian Go- »the ^ ^ be reck 01 Letter from Foreign Office, dated 21st Novem ber 1868, p. 547.

On the line of march, or when ' travelling on duty, carriage should be furnished ' to our Officers by the Government of the Shah. ' It might be stated that it does not appear, on ' full consideration, that any terms less favourable &lt;c than these will induce Officers of the Indian array &lt;c possessing the necessary qualifications for the ' efficient performance of duties of this important ' character to accept service with the Shah's army, ce and that Her Majesty's Government could not &lt;£ permit any Officers to be so employed except « those of proved capacity in the upper grades and ' of high promise in the lower. ' If these terms should be acceptable to the ' Persian Government, the Duke ot Argyll will ' place himself in communication with the Governor General of India with a view to the immediate a furtherance of the contemplated arrangement. Shortly after this the Foreign Office invited attention to a Despatch from Mr. Alison, in which he stated that the Shah was most anxious that the relations between the British Government and his own should once more be placed on the same cordial footing as the'y were in the time of Futteh Ah Shah, when a detachment of Military Officers were employed in that country by the English Govern ment in organizing the Shah's army. His Majesty honed that the British Government would follow a similar course now, and send the Officers required to Persia, without stipulating that they should be paid by the Shah, who would, on his part, not Jail to make such a return for this friendly act m the manner in which they would be received and treated12 whilst thus employed, as would be gratifying to them. His Majesty was well aware that when the English Government decided upon any particular course, or had an object in view, money was not with them the consideration, and he thought that they might consider the present a suitable occasion for showing the friendly interest they took in the welfare of Persia by adopting the course suggested, in deference to the wish expressed by the Shah after deliberately considering the proposal he was making. Whereupon the Earl of Clarendon suggested that it would be better to await Mr. Alison's arrival in London before taking the matter into consideration. To this the Duke of Argyll agreed, but nothing further having been heard of the subject, on the 2nd August a reminder was sent to the Foreign Office, who thereupon invited an expression of Mr. Alison's views, which were as follows:— 'London, 5th August 1869. 'I have the honour % to state, in reply to your Lordship's communication of yesterday's date, that there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the Officers required by the Shah could improve the organization of the Persian army, and that if those Officers were to^be made totally independent of the Persian Government it would materially improve their position, entitle them to greater consideration, and would enable them to exercise a degree of authority which would be attended with beneficial results. ' The Persian army would appear to be at present in a very pitiable condition. Its only instructors are a few Italian refugees, who are sometimes subjected to insulting language, and who pass half their time in running after their pay and allowances. Indeed the failure of the late French Military Mission may be mainly ascribed to the unpopularity incurred by them owing to the unpunctuality of the Persian Government in money matters. They eventually had recourse to abusive language, and the Foreign Minister told me he had materially impaired his position by dunning the Persian authorities for moneys due to these gentlemen. The Shah became so annoyed on this subject that he ordered them to be speedily paid off and allowed to depart. ' If Her Majesty's Government should consider it desirable to incur the expense which the Shah now wishes them to undertake with reference to these Officers, I do not think it would be de sirable that it should be so openly stipulated with the Persian Government. This fact would not improve its political position with regard to Russia, and, looking to the ever recurring subjects of dispute between the two countries, Russia could at any time find a plausible pretext for making the Shah feel its displeasure. The Persian Government might, for instance, allot suitable pay and allowances to the Officers required, but it might be arranged that Her Majesty's Government would not press this subject. ' I may add, on the other hand, that the Shah has been for some time labouring under great anxiety owing to the progress of Russia in Asia Minor, and that a mark of interest, such as that under consideration, would be very acceptable to His Majesty. It would not only afford him an opportunity of organizing his army, but it would also raise him in the consideration of his own subjects, and that is a matter to which he attaches a great deal of importance. ' I am not prepared to state whether, in the event of the Officers in question not being paid by Her Majesty's Government, the Shah would still wish to have them sent to him. The King's desire on this subject was repeatedly pressed upon the attention of Her Majesty's Government, and a certain rate of pay and allowances, somewhat below our expectations, had indeed been proposed by the Persian Government, but on the occasion of my taking leave of His Majesty he expressed a desire to establish his relations with England on the best possible terms, and his Minister for Foreign Affairs afterwards explained to me that the payment Letter from Foreign Office, dated Ilth June 1869.

' (Signed) C. Alison.' The Earl of Clarendon, in forwarding to the Duke of Argyll this last-mentioned communication, stated that the question of pay was a point on which an understanding seemed in the first place necessary. In February 1870, the Duke of Argyll inquired whether the terms suggested in the India Office letter of 5th March 1869 had ever been communi cated to the Shah's Government, and, if so, whether any opinions had been expressed by His Majesty with respect to them; further, His Grace invited attention to Mr. Alison's statement as above, that he was not aware whether, in the event of the Officers not being paid by Her Majesty's Govern ment, the Shah would still wish to have them sent to him,—a point upon which it was suggested that further information should be obtained from the Government of Persia. To this the Foreign Office replied that, on the receipt of the letter of the 3rd March 1869, Mr. Alison was informed that, in the event of the Persian Government consenting to accept the terms prescribed, the Governor General would be instructed to carry out the proposed arrangement at once, and Mr. Alison was instructed to secure the due performance by the Persian Government, of any engagements entered into by them. Lord Clarendon was led to conclude that Mr. Alison's despatch of the 6th May was subsequent to the receipt of these instructions. He therefore sug gested to His Grace whether, with a view to avoiding the further delay of a reference to Teheran, some determination should not be come to as to the expediency of the expense being undertaken by Her Majesty's Government. The Duke of Argyll then observed that the pay ment in full by the British Government of the Officers so employed,— i.e., of their special local allowances, as well as of their ordinary Indian pay,—might appear to indicate a forwardness upon our part to promote an arrangement which had Uen acceded to only in accordance with the strongly expressed desire of His Majesty the Shah. Indeed' it might be represented as, a subsidising of the Persian Government for pur- poses of our own, and, as sueh, the arrangement might give umbrage to other Powers. Shou Lord Clarendon see no objection on this score, the required number of Indian Officers should be fur nished, who should receive their ordinary pay and allowances from the Indian Treasury, leaving it to Lord Clarendon to decide, with respect to their 16029. ;Dlocal allowances, whether these additional pay ments should be made from the Shah s Treasury or be disbursed by the British Government, either from Imperial or Indian funds. Lord Clarendon, while seeing no objection to the payment in full by the British Government of any British Officer who might be sent to Persia, as it would be, in fact, only reverting to the course pur sued in 1835, was not disposed to recommend that any expense should -be borne by the Imperial Go vernment ; it would therefore rest with the India Office to decide what they were prepared to do in the matter. ' Sir J. Kaye, in submitting the paper, stated that the time had arrived when it had become necessary to arrive at a final decision on the matter. The Foreign Office having distinctly repudiated all financial responsibility on the part of the Imperial Government, it remained to decide whether the entire allowances (Indian and Persian), or only the former, should be paid by the Indian Government, Sir J. Kaye considered it open to consideration whether, in the eventvjof the Shah's Government accepting the responsibility of paying the local allowances of the British Officers, it would not be expedient to pay them, in the first instance, through the British Mission at Teheran, and to leave the question of refund for subsequent adjustment with the Persian Government. The Duke of Argyll, however, after consultation with his Council, came to the determination only to furnish the Officers, and give them from the .Indian Treasury the ordinary Staff Corps pay and allowances, on the understanding that satisfactory arrangements were made for the payment by the Persian Government of their local allowances, on the scale laid down in the India Office letter of 5th March 1869. The letter, however, em bodying this decision was never sent, as the papers were mislaid whilst in circulation. When they ultimately came to light, it was considered too late to take any steps in the matter, which has accordingly remained in statu quo till the present time. It may be added, that in 1871 the Foreign Office forwarded* copy of a Memorandum drawn up by Mr. Eastwick on the policy of Great Britain toward Persia. Amongst other suggestions contained therein, it was proposed that British Officers should be sent to Teheran to drill and discipline the Per sian Army. Copy of this Memorandum was for warded to the Government of India, who thereupon stated &lt;£ We have great doubts as to the expediency of ' the'suggested employment of Indo-British Officers ' in the Persian Army. The first obstacle to such ' a measure is the paucity of unemployed Officers ' qualified for such duty. Letter from Foreign Office, dated 26th March 1870.

For such ' a duty picked men could only be employed,—men who are Oriental scholars, and who have a good knowledge of Persian. 44 There are 143 unemployed Officers in Bengal, ' and about the same number in the other two ' Presidencies. Of these 143 Officers there are ' not more than 14 who, taking the very lowest ' estimate of the qualifications required, could be ' considered fit for duty with the Persian Army. ' Most of these possess no knowledge of Persian, ' or, indeed, any Oriental language except Hin- ' doostani. Probably 20 unemployed Officers in ' the three Presidencies are the most that could be ce found fit for such a duty. The little Looshai ' Expedition has absorbed nearly every qualified ' Bengal Officer in subsidiary duties, such as charge ' of coolies, &amp;c. Good Officers are not kept unem- ' ployed in India, save for a time under accidental ' circumstances.

The ways of Oriental Governments are ' not our ways, and, in peace as well as in war, Offi- ' cers placed in such a position must be cognizant ' of deeds, and participatory to some extent in ' actions, which no man of honour can approve. u If British Officers cannot be in supreme com- ' mand, they cannot enter on such service. ' Moreover, we have no reason to believe that ' Persia desires the services of British Officers for a the organization of the army. She has not, to 44 our knowledge, expressed any wish on the sub- ' ject. If she does ask for European assistance, « we think it would be better given by men who ' are not in the service of our Government.

See Enclosure to Foreign Office Letter, dated 23rd July 1868. tl J e Shah's Government proposed that England should furnish Persia with a few steam vessels of war, to be delivered one a year, to be commanded by English Officers and manned in whatever way might be thought most suitable, ouch vessels to be mainly employed in protecting 1 ersian commerce and enforcing the orders of the Shah in the Persian ports in the Gulf. The cost of the vessels it was proposed to repay in yearly instalments. This proposal was repeated in July of the same year. Mr. Alison, by whom the matter was reported to the Foreign Office, strongly urged the propriety of deputing a Naval Officer acquainted with the Persian Gulf to report on the matter, and suggested Captain Felix Jones as a fitting person. Sir S. Northcote, while he doubted at the time the expediency of affording any encouragement to the measure proposed by the Shah, preferring rather that Her Majesty's Government should exercise their good offices to keep the peace of the Gulf, saw no objection to the despatch of a Naval Officer to Teheran to discuss the question with His Ma jesty's Ministers, if in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs such a proceeding would soothe the mind of the Shah ; and it was suggested that, should the Admiralty concur, a telegraphic message might be sent to Mr. Alison in the above sense. This was done on 10th July 1868. The Foreign Office also put themselves in com munication with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty respecting the wish of the Shah to esta blish a naval force under the command of British Officers, but their Lordships saw grave objections to the employment of a force of ships in the manner proposed, since it might happen that the Officers might find themselves in an unseemly position between the Persian and their own Government, in the event of their being called upon by the Shah to take coercive measures against a small Power which the British Government had determined to protect. Their Lordships, however, entirely con curred in the proposal to send out a Naval Officer to Teheran to confer with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, and they volunteered to afford him every assistance in the way of obtaining information previous to his departure. They also offered to ascertain the views of Sir L. Heath, the Senior Naval Officer on the Indian Station, as to the pro bable effect and operation of the measures proposed by Persia—an offer which Lord Stanley deemed it advisable to accept. Consequent on this strong expression of opinion on the part ot the Lords 16029. E18 Commissioners of the Admiralty, Stanley addressed a letter to the Persian Minister at this Court in the sense of the above -mentioned letter from their Lordships. Meanwhile Mr. Alison placed himself in commu nication with the Viceroy of India. His Excellency expressed his opinion as follows ;— « Para. 3. Her Majesty's Government will not fail to observe that the Shah would rather seek the co-operation of Ureat Britain than of any other Foreign Power in this matter. It would, indeed, be disastrous to our influence in the Persian trult if the Shah were to throw himself upon the support ot America or France; and, should such a result be imminent, we are pre pared to recommend an early compliance with the proposal made through Mr. Alison, rather than_ give an opportunity to any Foreign Power to obtain a footing in the Gulf. ' 4. There are, however, difficulties in the practical working of the scheme proposed by the Shah, which may not have pr®' sented themselves to the Persian Government. The necessity oi adopting measures for the punctual payment of the Officers and crews of the vessels of war, and meeting the heavy expenses ot such a naval force as the Shah desires to have, would in all pro bability give rise to pecuniary demands of a disagreeable nature, at times when it might be inconvenient to meet them, and might embitter our relations with his Government. Nor would such a force, commanded by British Officers, be at all times so amenalilc to the orders of the Persian Government as the Shah would desire and expect. Political relations in the Persian Gulf are very complicated and necessitate frequent reference to the medi ation and arbitration of the British Government. With a naval force at his command the Shah's power and influence would be strengthened to a degree that might occasionally induce him to attempt measures which the British Government could not, con sistently with their obligations to other Powers, permit; and it is not to be .supposed that, in such circumstances, the British Officers in command of the force would readily obey the orders of the Shah in opposition to the policy of their own Government. ' 5. For these and similar reasons we consider it preferable that we should take measures to have a small marine force of our own in the Gulf, to be employed in maintaining the general peace and in the protection of trade. Such a force would more effec tually secure the Shah's real interests than any force of his own, while it would give stability to an ascendancy in the Gulf, which ever since the abolition of the local Navy there has been some risk of onr losing, and would exclude all pretext for the intro duction of other Powers. * * * * '•6. We are in communication with the Bombay Government on the subject of the provision of a permanent naval force for the security of our interests in the Persian Gulf, and we shall address you again when the scheme is matured. It is chiefly from the absence of such a force that present political compli cations between the Governments of Persia and Muscat, and between several of the maritime tribes have arisen, and it is in our opinion impossible for the peace of the Gulf to be main tained and trade protected unless the Resident at Bushire has at his command the means of enforcing the terms of the maritime truce. The question is one of vital importance to our political position in the Gulf, and it is matter of much regret to us that, when the Indian Navy was abolished, some special arrangements were not made for the maintenance of a small force for the protection of our interests in the Seas.' The views of the Bombay Government, to whom the question was referred by the Government of India as above stated, were as follows;— ' The Governor in Council would propose the {&lt; constitution of a special Indian squadron, officered ' principally from the Royal Navy. But he thinks ' that the Indian Government should appoint the ' Officers, and should not be absolutely precluded ' from employing persons not in the service of the See Letter from Foreign Office, dated 23rd July 1868.

' 3.

In forwarding copy of this letter to the Foreign Office, Sir S. Northcote expressed an opinion that, in the then stage of negotiations, it would not be desirable to inform the Persian Government that there was any intention to substitute a flotilla of our own for that contemplated and proposed by the Shah. To which the Foreign Office replied that the Viceroy, in their above-mentioned letter, had suggested that a suitable opportunity should be taken of quietly sounding the Shah's Government respecting the establishment of a small naval force in the Gulf. The whole question was then deliberately con sidered by the Secretary of State in Council. It would be beyond the limits of this Precis to quote the opinions expressed on this matter by various high authorities; it may be stated gene rally that Sir S. Northcote, Mr. Prinsep, and Sir J Currie were in favour of establishing a small flotilla. Sir J. Kaye and Captain East wick were averse to, and Sir G. Clerk in favour of, the Shah's proposal. Sir B. Frere wished to wait till receipt of report from the Officer specially deputed to report on the matter. Ultimately a letter was sent to the Foreign Office, asking them to take the question into their consideration with especial reference to. the expediency or otherwise of con- stitutinff a special Indian squadron. It is not within the province of this Precis to follow the further details of this scheme, which, in its ultimate shape is in no way connected with the arrange- ment proposed by the Shah; it may be stated e-enerallv that the arrangement at present in toice fs that the Imperial Government supply six armed ships, with crews of 1,000 men, at a cost to the Indian Exchequer of 70,000/. pe.-annumjthreeof these vessels are for special service in the Persian Gulf, and three for general employment. Meanwhile, on 21st November 1868 Lord Stanley, writing from the toreign Office, stated 'As regards the question of sending a Naval ' Officer to Teheran to consult with the Persian20 Government as to the formation of a Persian flotilla on the Persian Gulf, Lord Stanley is inclined to think, after consultation with the Admiralty, that no real advantage to Persia would result from such a measure, which would involve the Shah in great immediate expense, and could scarcely fail to end in disappointment. Moreover, Lord Stanley understands that the Board of Admiralty consider that by stationing two or three small British ships of war in the Gulf the police of its waters would be more effectually main tained, while any difficulties which might ensue if the duty of doing so were delegated to a Persian naval force would be avoided. ' If, therefore, Sir S. Northcote concurs in this view, Lord Stanley would instruct Mr. Alison to say that Her Majesty's Government had been most anxious to meet the wishes of the Shah in regard to the measures to be taken for providing for the maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf, and would willingly have sent out a naval Officer, as he desired, to confer with the Persian Govern ment on the subject. But that, on the fullest consideration, they had come to the conclusion that the assistance which such an Officer could render by his suggestion would go but a very short way in enabling the Shah to set on foot a naval force, and that an attempt to do so could not but end in disappointment, and would involve the Shah in an amount of expenditure far beyond any benefit that Persia could possibly reap from the measure. Her Majesty's Government had, therefore, concluded that they would best consult the interests of the Persian Government by not sending a Naval Officer to Teheran, but rather by making arrangements for maintaining, by means of a British naval force, tranquillity in the Persian Gulf, and they would, without delay, make such arrangements.' The purport of this letter was communicated by telegraph in the first instance, and afterwards in writing, to Mr. Alison, by whom the decision of Her Majesty's Government was duly announced to the Shah. The matter then fell through. In the same year, however, Mr. Thomson, Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, reported that he understood that Mirza Mehdee Khan, the Persian Agent, de spatched to Bahrein to inquire into the disturbances there, had pointed out to his Government that English influence must continue to* be paramount in the Gulf, and that Persia can never exercise the authority which she ought to have in that sea, unless she possesses some kind of naval establish ment of her own, and that he (the Mirza) had con sequently strongly urged upon the Shah's Minister the expediency of making immediate arrangements, either by direct purchase, or by application to one of the European Powers, with a view to the formation of a Persian flotilla in the Gulf, as a means of making good the Shah's claims to sovereignty over Bahrein, of resisting the pretensions of the Imaum of Muscat Letter from Foreign Office, dated 30th Nov. 186,8, p. 813.

Much about the same time (1869), the Per sian Government applied to the French Government for their advice and assistance in arranging for the purchase by the Shah of a ship of war for service in the Persian Gulf. The Emperor was reported to have been disposed to further as far as possible the wishes of the Shah, but nothing definite was decided upon. Thereupon the Government of India in structed Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran to report confidentially the whole feeling of the Persian Government on the subject, especially as to whether, in addition to any arrangements that might be made for British vessels of war in the Persian Gulf, the Shah was still eager to possess a ship of his own, and to what extent and in what way it might be desirable that the British Govern ment should take any steps to meet the Shah's wishes in the matter. Mr. Alison, in reply, stated that he believed the Shah's Government considered that the possession of a few ships in the Gulf would enable him to assert his authority and protect his interests with greater efficacy against the designs proceeding from Muscat, while it might be useful in furthering his views on Bahrein. Being disappointed at the terms on which it was proposed to send out a naval Officer to Teheran, terms which were defi nitely refused by the Shah's Government, they applied to the French Government. Mr. Alison added that, though the matter was, so far as the latter proposal was concerned, in abeyance, he deemed it desirable that we should meet the wishes of the Shah as far as possible, as it was not likely that the Persian Government, in its then state of impecuniosity, were prepared to meet the expenses attendant on the deputation of a naval Officer to Teheran. Mr. Alison suggested that such informa tion as might be procurable in India might be communicated to them, as it was very desirable that they should be fully informed of the expense, the difficulties, and the dangers they wo ^ ld ^ v ® to encounter in carrying out the wishes of the Shan. The Government of India, in reviewing the case, expressed their willingness, should the Shah con tinue to manifest a strong desire for the possession of a ship of war in the Gulf, to adhere to their former proposal to supply him with one vessel of war, as a means of removing any anxiety which t e Persian Government may feel respecting the defence of their coasts. At the same time, they recorded a strong opinion that it was neither necessary nor expedient that the Shah should mamtam m the Persian Gulf any number of armed ci a t. In y also deemed it incumbent to object fir '' l &gt;' a S al ' s the possession by His Majesty of a fleet which might enable him to further his claim on Bahrein. ' In our opinion,' they added, ' the Persian Go- « vernment would consult their own best interests 16029. F22 ' by ceasing to aspire to the possession of a naval ' force, which would not only be a serious drain ' upon her resources, but a source of danger to « herself, from the complications that would inevi- « tably arise with the British Government in respect ' to the peace of the Gulf, with Turkey, who is ' exceedingly jealous of the Persian pretensions in ' their waters, and with the Arab tribes, who would ' not brook the assumption of supremacy on the ' part of Persia.' For those reasons, the Government of India were of opinion that Mr. Alison should be instructed to take any opportunity that might present itself to discourage, in a quiet way, the project ot the Shah, and, if possible, to get the discussion of the subject postponed, or altogether dropped. Copy of this Despatch was forwarded to the Letter to foreign Foreign Office on 5th September 1870, with an g 70&gt; intimation that the Duke of Argyll concurred in the expediency of adopting the course recommended by the Government of India. To this letter no reply has been received, nor does the correspondence transmitted by Her Majesty's Ambassador at Teheran contain any allusion to the subject. . A. N. W.jr&gt; APPENDICES. APPENDIX A.

Extract from Memorandum by Sir H. C. Rawlinson, dated 20th July 1868. The doctrine which prevails at present in our Eastern diplomacy is simply this, that Persia is too weak and faithless to justify any extraordinary expense in' keeping up cordial relations with the Shah We are content for a while to occupy a subordinate position to Russia at 1 eheran, trusting that, when the time comes for action, we may regain our lost ground by increased expen diture and redoubled activity; but this is, after all, a very short-sighted policy. The goodwill ot a nation —that which we once possessed, but have now lost in Persia, is not to be purchased in a day It is the growth of time, of steady unremitting attention. If we desire, then, to check the advance of Russia towards India, if we desire, above all, to render impossible,—or, at any rate, indefinitely to postpone,—her occupation of Herat, it is indispensable that we should bestir ourselves in Persia at once. The vast expenditure that we incurred in the days ot Harford Jones, and Malcolm, in expelling the French from Teheran, is no longer required. What is required is an indication of renewed interest in the country, and a disposition to protect it against Russian pressure. Our Officers should be again placed in positions of influence and power W1 th the Persian troops, as in the days of Christie, of Lindsay, and of Hart. Presents of improved arms, and perhaps artillery, would testify to our awakened interest. 1 he Persian nobles should be encouraged to send their sons for education to London, rather than to Paris. Investments of English capital in banks, in railways, in mining operations, and other commercial enterprises are freely proffered, and if supported by our authorities would create a farther bond of union between the countries. Among a people, again, who are so fond of display, and attach so much value to outward forms, it is of the first importance that our mission should be kept up on a very liberal scale, and that presents should be freely distributed, that the diplomatic establishment, in fact, at Teheran, should be Oriental rather than European. A further opportunity has occurred for creating a very favourable impression, and, in fact, inaugurating the new system which is recom mended, in the Shah's application for our aid in creating and keeping up a Persian naval force in the Gulf. Considering the singular maritime inaptitude of the Persians, it is not likely that this scheme, notwithstanding our countenance and support, will ever realize the Shah's expectations, but our acquiescence in the proposal would, at any rate, very much strengthen our influence at Court, and might aid even in developing that community of interests which our joint telegraphic establishment has already initiated. Extract from Remarks by Brigadier-General Lumsden, dated 21st September 1868. Equal in importance with our relations with Aflghanistan and our other neighbours is the question of our influence at the Persian Court, so ably advocated by General Rawlinson. I most cordially agree with him in all he says on this head, and consider that the recovery of paramount influence there at the present juncture would be cheap at a heavy outlay. ^ . J A # • 9 ..l.' Extract from Memorandum by Lieutenant-Governor D. F. McLeod, Punjab, dated 10th October 1868. I fully agree with Sir H. Rawlinson in the opinion he has expressed as to the expediency of endeavouring to regain in full the goodwill of Persia, which we formerly possessed, by the exer cise of steady unremitting attention, and by liberally conferring on her ruler and nobles from time to time liberal grants and presents, as occasion may require. What class of Officers are most likely to place our relations with that country on a satisfactory footing, it must rest with Government to determine, but Sir Henry Rawlinson's suggestions on this head appear to me to be well deserving of attentive consideration. / • • '■ s ' ' • . .

Sir Henry Rawlinson's proposition is to make friends with Afghanistan and Persia, re-estab lishing our influence with both j he would give European Officers for the Persian army, and, I think (I write from memory), he makes mention in one place of giving material support to Afghanistan, if necessary, though he would prefer our efforts being confined within the limits of diplomacy. &lt; If Persia can thus be made ours in feeling, by aid given to her by us in establishing a naval force in the Gulf, and if her army can be drilled and commanded by British Officers, at any rate there would be a game worth playing, and, situated as the Persian territory is, such a position must have a certain influence on Russian proceedings in Central Asia, while it would tend to our honour and influence in Asiatic politics generally.25 W hether this nttitude can bo accomDHshpfl ixrifVi/M &lt;- for a structure which might crumble to pieces when submitteT^o and 1 We11 nigh ruinous outla y confess, a very poor opinion of the Persian troons —I am not in a P res ? ure .-for I have, I alwa,ys appeared to me to be so overcrowed and exD(K«l a f p t0 - Pers ' a has felt it hkely that we should be able to cope successfuUv with flf l t/ 8 ''';, 4 1 have neTer and thus that what favour we obtained for a time would onlv 1t, t ln ? rSlan '''I^oraacy, money.

But I do not support the recommendation that Engiish Officers be encouraged to enter the 1 ersian service, and am altogether opposed to the policy of spending much money out of Indian revenues m Persia, I believe that such a system would prove of no real advantage in strengthening oui infhience in I ersia, and certainly 1 think that such an expenditure would prove mO' ( . eii .ji on oui own liontier. 1 ersia appears to me to be so weak in herself from various causes that she is practically under the control of Russia, and utterly unable to resist the influence of that power. In any great struggle connected with Afghanistan, Persia would certainly follow the behests of Russia, even though unwilling on some grounds to do so. Extract from a Minute by Sir R. Temple , dated 8th December 1868. The other point is the maintaining of a British naval force, at as moderate a strength as might be consistent with efficiency, in the Persian Gulf. The Shah of Persia recently applied for such a force, to be paid by his Government, This proposal could not exactly be complied with, because the Shah could not really pay for the force, and any such liability on his part would lead to fresh complications. But the British Government might well take the opportunity of assuring the Shah that it would maintain, as an ally, such naval force as might be needed. An additional reason for doing this might be the apprehension that, if we hold back, some other European naval power might step in. And we have 'actual information that something of this kind has been thought of by at least some French authorities. Extract from a Minute by Colonel H. W, Norman , dated 8th December 1868. I also entirely agree with the Viceroy as to the inexpediency of placing British Officers with the Persian troops. If a struggle comes and Persia is inclined to our side, no doubt we may then use means to strengthen her hands, but the presence of British Officers might not be accepted now, or, if accepted, might lead to disagreements, while their employment cannot be supposed to be likely to influence Persia to side with us, and, if disposed to go against us, she would dismiss these Officers at her pleasure. Extract from a Minute by the Honourable G. N. Taylor , dated 12th December 1868. As regards our Persian diplomacy, though Sir H. Rawlinson's proposals and s VSg e stions are entitled to great weight, I incline to agree with the Governor General that, for p least, the transfer to the India Office of our relations with that Court is all that is required. Extract from a Minute by Sir W. R. Mansfield , dated 24th December 1868. T onn see no reason for repeating the experiment of sending British Officers to drill the of the Shah. This has been tried before both in Persia and Turkey, without any really prac result so far as I have ever been able to learn. 16029. G \y\26 r appendix c. Memorandum by Sir H. Rawlinson , dated 10th October 1868. t e ' tW if would be highly expedient to grant the Shah's application for the detachmen^of a body^of Commissioned a'nd 'Non-commissioned Officers to Persia, to be employed organizing and ^ns^^j^o ^e^^militarf success, that is, they would not be able to They would not probably ^^^JXfand efficiency of an army of thirty or forty thousand produce any Powerful effect on me ^di^ipuneano^e^^^ ^ import J t purpos l They would, in men, but they would ne ert ao-ainst other European nations. The experiment has been the first place, preoccupy t. § r ^ officers and has failed, because the Government which recently tried with French a nd the individuals were left to supplied these Officers hsA adventurers ; but it would be very different if pursue a personal caree , accent of Officers from the Russian Government, which has direct interest ^n the ^untry, and which would thus cordially support its Officers, with a view of bringing the Persian Army more or less under its own control This indeed would be a serious ^1^0^ \n Pe^ia, besides the negative advantage of keeping out the Russians may be expected to produce much positive good. It will promote a good feeling between the two countries, render the Persians more familiar with our views, induce them to look to us for counsel and support, rather than regard us with mistrust, and in fact create a certain C0 ?^ i nVhSbn hfsIving^Lt wherever British Officers have resided in Persia, and more especially in the provinces' beyond the sphere of Court intrigue, British influence, as compared with that of any other European nation, has become predominant, and I believe this to be a matter of very considerable interest, in view to future contingencies. , f It is also very important to have a nursery of Persian employes upon whom we may draw for the service of the State, as occasion requires. Indian service alone will not give the necessary qualification, and the telegraph staff in Persia, although valuable m this respect, is not sufficiently To five the experiment of a Persian detachment a fair chance ot success, it is, however, indisnensable that the Officers should be in an independent position with regard to pay JnT allowances The French and German Officers lost their influence, and constantly found themselves in a false position, because they were dependent on the Persian Government for their sunoorf and unless, therefore, we think the matter of sufficient consequence to justify a moderate expenditure, as a measure of Indian defence, we had better throw cold water on the Pr( $hat iThoukf recommend would be, that we should follow the precedent of 1833, when, under similar circumstances, we did meet the requisition of the then Persian Government lor the services of a body of Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers, corresponding as nearly as possible with the detachment which is now applied for. On that occasion, we gave a liberal command allowance to the Officer who was placed in charge of the party, and we granted a small additional sum to each subordinate Officer, in excess of his regimental pay and allowances leaving the question of further remuneration by the Persian Government for arrangement between the Mission and the Persian authorities. . * * u j u i. • 4.- This plan answered sufficiently well during the five years the detachment in question was employed in Persia, and is the only one which appears to me suitable to the present occasion. Some modification of detail would probably be required in selecting Officers from the different branches of the service, the result of our experience on the one hand, and in relerence to the altered constitution of the Indian Army upon the other. Instead of sending Engineer and Cavalry Officers and Sergeants, who are nearly useless, I would increase the number of the Artillery and Infantry details, the regular Persian Army being confined to those branches ; but all such minor matters may conveniently be left for future adjustment. The only immediate matter for consideration is, whether a general answer in the affirmative should be telegraphed to Teheran, and I would strongly recommend that such an answer should be made. Memorandum by Mr. Kaye (now Sir J. Kaye ), dated 27th 1868. The question of the employment of a certain number of Officers of the Indian Army, as Instructors to the Forces of the Shah of Persia, is revived, in a somewhat urgent manner, and I venture to suggest that the Secretary of State should decide it, without further reference to the Government of India. rm ^ When last it was referred, it fell through—nothing was done. The Persian Government did not bid high enough ; and it was considered that the right men could not be obtained upon the terms that were offered. The question now is, whether, with a view to ulterior political advantages, we shall undertake to pay, from our own Treasury, the entire staff salary, on a liberal footing, of the Officers deputed to Persia to organize and instruct the Persian Army. If we do not, some other European power will. It is better to occupy the ground for ourselves.27 de^rrJrth^Hre^Gotr' 9 Imperia, interest and 'W-' « I think, be It may, of course, be said that the interests involved are rather Fnrrmaan fV,o aw i that, therefore, the expense of employing British Officers in Persia ought to be defrayed bv 'the authorize the expenditure from the Indian revenues ? A Memorandum by Sir Henry Rawlinson is enclosed, which points out the advantages of the arrangement. If the Secretary of State should sanction this arrangement, we should address both the Foreio-n Ofiice and the Government of India with as little delay as possible. Both Persia and India should be communicated with by telegraph. Memorandum by Sir R. Montgomery , dated 30th October 1868. I have perused these papers, and concur generally in the Memorandum written by Sir Henry Rawlinson. I do not think we should decline the offer that has been made. If the arrangements be judiciously carried out, a good feeling will be created, greatly to our advantage: For the Head of the Staff, we should not look merely look to a good drill master. He should be an Officer of various experience, and who has had civil and political work in India, intelligent and courteous in his manners, and able to speak the Persian language. Under him would be intelligent European Officers, specially selected, and acquainted with the language and tribes on our Western Frontier, from Kurrachee to Hazerah. I would strongly recommend that, instead of European Non-commissioned Officers, who greatly offend Natives by their ignorance, and want of knowledge of their customs and habits, that Native Commissioned and Non-commissioned Officers from the frontier regiments, and of the same creed as the Persians, be selected to accompany the detachment. Men of rank (important) and family, can be found, and they should be liberally paid. They would form the connecting link between our Officers and the Persians, and I believe that the effect would be excellent. They will gain admission to the social circle of Persian society, and will not fail to extol the British power and fame. I think also a high Native Officer of rank might be attached as Aide-de-camp or Secretary to the Head of the Staff. APPENDIX D. The Policy of Great Britain towards Persia. The Treaty of Turkumanchai, between Russia and Persia, was signed on the 21st of February 1828, and soon after Sir J. Macdonald paid 200,000 tomayns to Persia to abandon ^ 3rd and 4th Articles of a Treaty which bound England to assist Persia with a subsidy in case of war with Russia. The date is important, for up to that time the influence of England was paramount m Persia and a defensive alliance existed between the two countries. But a new policy \\ds inaugurated Russia acquired increased and increasing influence in Persia, while England, ascrfS to Russian instigation movements on the part of Persia which m reality proceeded ? tV.f amhinnns asoirations of the Shahs, set herself to restrain those movements, and to limit ^ ^ inhibiting her from advancing in the direction of Afghanistan, sSn Mekran ^discouragfng every other design or effort on her part to — oSin territory Thus, ifter the death of Abbas Mirza in 1833, h.s son was deferred b y the amyrandltu!!'.!

Muhammed Shah abandoned thesiege oi n j u i/ 183 9, till the 31st of March finally carry out the demands troops ; and intil that Shah's death, on the Jth'o^^eptember^sS, Ha^i Mirza Aghassi, the friend of Russia rather than of England, H 16029.28 remained Prime Minister. His successor, the Amir-i-Nizam, was f ™ only the frood of his country, which obviously was more likely to be a ' aine ' 1 b - v , ! A , rlia England than with Russia. He was succeeded, however in November better known as the Sadr-i-Azim, who, though once a British protege, was . , t u: g After protracted disagreements, his proceed.ngs led to the rupture of re ' at, ™ s ' country and Persia on the 5th of December 1855, which was followed by the_ Pf' 3111 ' f' e f® of Herat in 1856, and by onr declaration of war against Persia on the 1st ol Novembei that year. The second war with Persia (for the occupation of Kharak in 1838 must be regarded as the first) ended with the Treaty of Paris on the 4th of March 1857, but except during the short interval that Sir H. Rawlinson was Minister, and the very brief period in 1862-63 when the writer of this Memorandum was Charge d'Affaires, there has been no return to cordiality in our relations with Persia. At the present moment it is known indirectly that nothing but a sense or his inability to cope with us prevents the Shah from coming to au open rupiure with our Government. His Majesty considers himself personally aggrieved by our proceedings in the Persian Gulf, by the support given to the Ruler of Cabul and denied to Persia, and by the dis couragement of Persian pretensions to Merv and Sistan. Whatever may be the tone of his olKcial correspondence, it is certain that matters are in such a state that the Shah might easily bo induced to connive at, or, perhaps even openly assist, a Russian occupation of Herat, and advance towards the frpntier of Sindh. As we are entirely ignorant of the intrigues that are going on with Yakub Khan, a combination might be formed with him at any moment, which might entail upon us very troublesome and expensive operations. If the preceding remarks are correct, it is plain that the change of policy towards Persia com menced in 1828 has not been fruitful of good, but, on the contrary, has resulted in two wars, which have cost several millions, has changed the cordial alliance which existed between Great Britain and Persia prior to that date into chronic antagonism, and in a Russo-Persian invasion of Afghanistan. It seems, therefore, desirable to consider whether this policy should not bo laid aside or modified, and to examine the arguments for and against it Those who are in favour of it will probably say that it has enabled us to avoid giving umbrage to Russia, and that, but for it, the war which took place in the Crimea might have been antedated on the Caspian. They may say that the Persians are an effete nation, and their country a meve pabulum Orci, sure to be swallowed up by the Great Northern Power, when her deglutition of the Central Asian States, Khiva, Bokhara, and Kokan, which is still far from complete, has been accomplished; that Persian administration is corrupt through all its branches, and that, consequently, Persia is less able to defend herself now than in the days of Abbas Mirza, because a better organization, which implies regular supplies of money, is still more requisite at this time to enable the troops which the present Shah has endeavoured to form on European models to contend with a Russian army. They may argue that it is useless to attempt to bolster up such a State as this, and, that leaving Persia to its fate, our true policy is to await the invasion of India, if it ever takes place, within the Indian frontiers. Lastly, it will be said that no dependence is to be placed on Persian promises, and that so venal a Government as that of Persia can always be purchased when a necessity arises for dealing with it, so that should it ever be thought desirable to make common cause with it, or enlist its support, the offer of a subsidy will effect our purpose. The reply to all this is, that Russia would have been at a far greater disadvantage in attackin 0- Persia in alliance with us than she was in the Crimea. Until the Circassian exodus in 1860 the Russian arnhy could never have advanced far into Persia had the Persian forces been officered and paid, even in part, by England. No doubt Russia is in an infinitely more commandino - position as regards Persia at present than when the difficult countries on both shores of the Caspian were still independent, and the Cossacks remained at 500 miles greater distance on the west, and 800 on the east, from the Persian frontier than they are now. Still, there is yet time if we choose to avail ourselves of the opportunity, to make Persia a safe outer defence for India' impenetrable to Russia and to every other power. The Persians, far from beinfr effete, have hkfnrv ge TW r physi f. all y ? r mentally, from what they were in the palmiest days of their history. They live entirely in the open air, and are constantly on horseback. The sickly children die, and only the hardy survive. Hence, notwithstanding their vices, they are a fine athletic race. With an amount of nerve which Europeans might envy, and they wftnt nothing but . good discipline and proper organization to become truly formidable soMiprs Th ao \ 'v known them best are loudest in their praise.

The reply is that Jhm^h 7, 1 ^ !i 9 sake of consistency, a sudden and violent change of policy mighl be inexpedient a[ dl event it. will be well to prepare to steer on a new tack. We cannot allow Herat to become a part of Persia at present, hut there is now an opportunity of detaching it partially from Kabul 'and of placing a European Officer there who would keep us informed of all that went on This mith be done without exciting potice by moving up Mr. Dolmage from Meshed, and placing Mm 3r the Commissioner in Smdh. If the route by the Helmund and Jfushky be practicable comZnf cation between Herat and Kelat would be effected in eight or nine days^ partly on horseback and' partly on dromedaries. If not, letters would reach Kabul from Herat throno-h the Hazarah country m i5 or 16 days at most. As Mr. Dolmage is a medical man, and has lived for 10 years among the Persians, he could avoid giving offence far better than any one who could be sent from India. 1 he Shah might be completely propitiated by acknowledging the validity of his claim to Sistan 'is fdi as the Jlolixiund, and perhaps th© Bahr6in difficulty might bo g'ot rid of by promotin 0. Colonel Pelly, and offering to refer the Persian and Turkish claims to arbitration. In that case a stipulation might be made for the settlement of the Mekran frontier, and some encouragement might be given to the Shah to repossess himself of Merv, which is desitable on several accounts, and more particularly as keeping the Russians at a distance. It is perhaps possible that this might be etfected by negotiation with the Turcomans, and granting them a small subsidy. Above all, English Officers should be at once sent to discipline the Shah's troops, say 20 subalterns and sergeants and 5 field officers, whose expenses, to the extent of 15,000/. per annum, would be borne by the Indian Government, while there would be no difficulty in obtaining other emolu ments for them from the Persian Government, though it would not be well that they should be entirely dependent on that Government. The necessity of watching over the growth of opium in Persia would alone justify ten times the expenditure. It is only necessary to add that the character of the present Shah is such that it is very easy to obtain an influence over him for good, and that his secret inclinations are all towards an alliance with England. On the other hand, the prosperity of Persia would be all for our advantage, not only politically, as has been attempted to be shown in the preceding remarks, but also commercially. There is now a trade between India and Persia of about two millions, for which nothing as ye£ has been done beyond clearing the Persian Gulf of pirates, but which, by judicious measures, might be increased to ten times that amount.

Mr. Eastwick suggest^ that we shoukl *2^ we should mak e concessions should approve of her encroachments ^ feeis tan ana i ' erh even allow her to occupy to her in the Persian Gulf, and, . Jgratifying to the Shah, and for a axrassfJCft iiwraKwtt -—- T —- -30 Uzbescs to the north-east, with Affghans and Beloochees to the south-east, and with Arabs to the southf there would assuredly be rebellion in the provinces, and interference would be thus mvited both on the part of Turkey and of Russia. There is only one measure advocated by Mr. Eastwick which seems to me to combine the two advantages of strengthening Persia and pleasmg the Shah, and that is furnishing Officers for the Persian Army. It will be a great pity, I think, if we allow considerations of economy to inter- fere with this scheme. There are large numbers of unemployed Officers of the Staff Corps in India from whom a due selection might be made for service in Persia, and even if wo gave them a small additional allowance while serving in a foreign country, the expense would be but trifling. The real and essential improvement, however, that is required is, that more care and attention should be bestowed upon the mission at the Court of Teheran. The Minister in the first place should not be a man who, however, able and experienced merely discharges his duties perfunctorily as a member of Her Majesty's diplomatic service, but one who takes a personal interest in the country, and who should consider it his special mission to gain the Shah's confidence and friendship. There is no Court in the world at which personal conduct and personal feelings are more powerful, for good or for evil, than at Teheran. It was Sir John M'Neill's personal interest with Futteh Ali Shah which for so many years, and under greater difficulties than exist at present, placed us in a position of complete superiority at the Persian Court. Indeed, when we consider that the Shah is himself the Government, and that, having no experience beyond his own country, he is among the most impressible of mortals, it must be seen that strict diplomatic rules are quite inapplicable to Persia, while personal qualifications and personal management are the main points to be regarded. If the Shah is once brought to look upon the British Minister as his personal friend and confidential counsellor, then dissuasion from territorial aggrandisement, instead of producing irritation as at present, would be received with thankfulness, as advice tendered in the true interests of the country. For instance, in regard to the pending questions of Bahrein and the Mekran frontier, the Shah fully believes that we are actuated by selfish views in resisting Persian pretentions, and -diplomatic protests accordingly only provoke feelings of resentment; but if the British Minister, as the trusted adviser of the Crown, could point out to His Majesty that the acquisition of an Arab or Belooch dependency would be a source of weakness rather than of strength to his Government, then the discussion might be closed, not only without disturbing our amity, but with positive advantage to the confidential character of our relations. Delicate qusstions, indeed, of this nature, in which Persian and British Indian interests are apparently in conflict, are constantly coming to the surface, and require the most careful handling by an experienced Indian diplomatist, in order to be disposed of without giving umbrage to the Shah. I would strongly urge, therefore, upon Her Majesty's Government that the recent recom mendation of a Select Committee of the House of Commons in favour of the retransfer of the Persian Mission from the Foreign to the India Office should be at once attended to ; and I would desire to see the best man of the Indian Political service—one of the old type of Malcolm and Elphinstone and Sutherland, if such are now to be found—selected for the important post of Her Majesty's Envoy and Minister at Teheran. The only instructions I would give to such a Minister would be, ' Make a personal friend of the Shah,' feeling satisfied that, if he were once established in a confidential position with His Majesty, he would have no difficulty in making his influence felt throughout the country, and in thus moulding its policy in conformity with the true interests of England and of Persia, which are, in fact, in all essential points, one and the same. Of course the Minister would require full support from the British Crown, both in regard to power and expenditure, but he must be mainly indebted for success to his personal character and to individual energy and address. I will only suggest, in conclusion, that if Officers should be sent to Persia on the scale recommended by Mr. Eastwick, which seems to me only reasonable, and suited to the object in view, the detachment should also convey to His Majesty a pair of Armstrong field guns, fully appointed, and some thousand stand of Enfield rifles, no longer required in India, which would certainly prove a most acceptable offering, and would give the necessary Mat to the employment of British Officers with the Persian Army.
