ASSHETON CROSS.'' /V &gt; REPORT. m TO THE QUEEN’S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. By Your Majesty’s Commission we are directed to inquire into and consider the working and effect of the Law and Treaties relating to the Extradition of Persons accused of Crime. Having inquired into and considered the subject so referred to us, we humbly submit to Your Majesty the following Report:— j # —The extradition of fugitive criminals is founded on a twofold motive : 1. That it is the common interest of mankind that offences against person and property, offences which militate against the general well-being of society, should be repressed by punishment, as the means of deterring others from committing, as well as of deterring the criminal himself from repeating the offence, as also of disabling the offender, either permanently or temporarily, from further crime. 2. That it is to the interest of the State into whose territory the criminal has come that he shall not remain at large therein, inasmuch as from his past conduct it may reasonably be anticipated that, if opportunity offers, he will again be guilty of crime. No State can desire that its territory should become a place of refuge for the malefactors of other countries. It is obviously its interest to get rid of them. On the first of these grounds we may reasonably claim from all civilised nations that they shall unite with us in a system which is for the common benefit of all; in other words, that they shall concede to us reciprocity .in the matter of extradition. But, looking to the second and narrower ground, it seems to us that, even if any btate should fail to concede full reciprocity, there is no principle which should make this country unwilling to surrender, and so to get rid of, the fugitive subjects of ot lei States who have been guilty of crime, and whose surrender is asked foi. ' We would therefore suggest that extradition treaties with other States, which appear to be practically of use only for the purpose of insuring reciprocity, should no lono-er be held to be indispensable, and that, while the power m the Crown of entering into extradition treaties with other nations, as now existing by statute, should still be retained, statutory power should be given to the ' rities to deliver up fugitive criminals whose surrender is asked for, irrespectively of tL existence of 'any treaty between this country and the State against whos^. law the offence has been committed. It is as much to oui advantage f j, should be punished, and that we should get rid of them as it is to that of tore,,. State that they should be brought within the reach ot its law. Inasmuch, however, as treaties may sometimes be necessary (by the laws or constitu. tion of foreign States) to enable effect to be given to conditions ™ ment of this countrv mav properly insist, and as it might in other cases pro' e “ Istaciet n^gotSons y fo P r LaLs or extradition g^neraStS Grovemment of this country might think it desira e oen , ^ ^ option power were made applicable to all other countries, wi on - shall extend or discretion by the Crown, it may be expedient ‘^rovi^e hat th^Act ^hal^exten^ only to those foreign States to which it may iom i Council would be made declared to apply It may be assumed that Jth a foreign State; and whenever there was a treaty or other binding arrange oy . g;on waB sufficiently made also whenever the British Government was satis P • ] je deemed the duty by the law of a foreign State for all the objects on which it might he aee j| or the policy of this country to insist. ^ ^II. With reference to both the principles to which we have adverted, it is obviously immaterial whether the fugitive criminal is a subject of the State demanding his surrender, or a subject of the country from which it is claimed. The matter is not, however, altogether free from difficulty, and in most of the existing treaties a stipulation is contained that a fugitive criminal, if a subject of the State in which he is found shall not be surrendered in respect of a crime committed in the other State. In favour of such a provision it is said that a man should not be withdrawn from his natural judges; that the State owes to its subjects the protection of its laws, and that it fails in this duty if it hands over any of them to a foreign jurisdiction, and thus deprives them of the guarantees afforded by the law of their own country; that it is impossible to place entire confidence in the justice of a foreign State, especially with regard to the subjects of another country ; and that it is a serious disadvantage to a man to be tried in a foreign language, and where he is separated from his friends and his resources, and from those who could bear witness to his previous life and character. It is, therefore, contended that there should be power to try in his own country a person charged with having committed a crime in another; and that he should be tried there instead of being surrendered to the foreign State for trial. To this it may be answered, first, that if every criminal ofience committed by a British subject within any foreign jurisdiction is to be triable and punishable here as if it had been committed in England, this would require a most extensive change in our whole system of criminal law, which has hitherto admitted that principle in a very few cases only, depending upon special reasons, and has never recognized the duty, or accepted the responsibility, of exercising a general control for purposes of police or punishment over the actions of British subjects in foreign countries. Furthermore, if this argument be good for anything, every man charged with an offence in a country of which he is not a subject should, by a common arrangement between the different Governments, be sent home to be tried, instead of being tried where the offence was committed; and this, though the laws of the two countries might be essentially different in respect of the quality and degree of the crime ; and it should therefore be made competent to a person so charged to claim to be sent home for the purpose of triala proposition too extravagant to be entertained. The offence is an offence against the law of the country in which it is alleged to have been committed. A person commorant in a foreign country owes obedience to its law in return for the protection which it affords him, as much as if he were one of its proper subjects Why because he has escaped beyond the jurisdiction of that law, should an offender, whose surrender is asked for, be in a ’different position from that in which he would have been m the country from which he has escaped ? Extradition, as a system, is based on the supposition that m the great majority of instances the persons whose surrender us claimed have, m fact, violated the law of the country demanding the surrender. I he instances m which the surrender of an innocent person may be demanded will be exceedingly rare. With the safeguards, which we shall advert to further on, the possibility of an innocent man being unjustly dealt with will be remote in the extreme. As regards the suggestion that confidence cannot be placed in the justice of foreign tribunals, it is obvious that when we are inviting other nations to unite with us in a system of extradition, any restriction which implies a doubt of the competency or justice of their tribunals involves a striking inconsistency. Extradition is based on mutual confidence m the administration of justice by the courts of both nations. It proceeds on t le assumption that impartial justice wiil be done to the party surrendered. We should be unwilling to surrender even a foreigner on any other assumption. It would IwifTf r ? a m lme ^ When a forei S ner is charged with an offence aga nst its law its tribunals would not do justice to such foreigner as equally and impar- ° ne C T 0f t 0ne 0f its own subjects. We know^hat inmir as a nXrJborrri ner f Cha wi? d Tv 1 an ° ffenCe receives the sa me measure of justice are nof enBtled tn «? eCt ' fwT th ® surr c nder of on e of our subjects is asked for, we alternat^^bfd^ it^ T 11 n0t be dealt with fair1 ^ when surrendered. The imnunit we mnU L Sh ° Uld n0t ii be f ° r f otfcen ’ a criminal may otherwise escape with imna^iaHtr a t the h T 6 / 11 confidei ? ce thafc one of our subjects will find the same anFumst y act on ^ &amp; f0r , eign tnb ? nal as a foreigner would find in one of ours, disappointed^ a^^ption m the belief that our expectation will not be better System ^ I^^the 0 ^ Convenienc c fh® 1 *® can be no question as to which is the system. It is the law of the foreign country which is alleged to have been7 broken. It is by that law that the fact, as well as the degree, of criminality and tl measure of punishment, should be determined. It is by those who have f 6 administer that law alone that these questions can be properly decided. Moreover, the witnesses are in the foreign country, and can only be brought to that of the accused at greatly increased expense and inconvenience. It is true that their evidence may be taken where they are, and transmitted in a written form. But this is by no means a satisfactory mode of proceeding in the administration of criminal -justice • besides which such a mode of proceeding would obviously be attended with serious dis advantage to the accused, inasmuch as the evidence will have been taken behind his back, without any opportunity for cross-examination, or inquiry as to the character or credibility of the witnesses; all which may well be deemed to counterbalance any disadvantage which may arise from his being tried out of his own country. ^ On the whole we are of opinion that the stipulation in question is unnecessary and inexpedient, and we recommend that it should be omitted in future treaties; and that endeavours should be made to have the existing treaties modified in this respect. III.—As to the offences which should be the subject of extradition. Extradition should embrace all those offences which it is the common interest of all nations to suppress; that is to say, offences against person and property, including in the latter category cases of fraud the purpose of which is to obtain property or money, offences against the bankrupt laws, forgery, and offences relating to coinage. To these it should be confined, to the exclusion of offences of a political or local character. It is true that it is to the interest of every nation that by the submission of its subjects to the constituted government internal peace and order shall be maintained. But one nation can scarcely be said to have such an interest in the particular form of government, or in the particular ruling dynasty, of another, as that it should be called upon to make common cause with it against political offenders. And however odious the character of the rebel who disturbs the peace of his own country and gives rise to bloodshed and disorder from interested motives, or reckless disregard of the miseries attendant on civil discord, yet both from history and our own experience we know that there are exceptional instances in which resistance to usurpation or tyranny may be inspired by the noblest motives, and in which, though unsuccessful, it may escape con demnation, and even command sympathy. It must alwaysbe difficult for a foreign nation, when political dissensions occur in another, to judgebetween the contending parties. Nay, such foreign nation itself may be divided in its views as to the merits or demerits of the particular cause. Influenced it may be by such considerations, the general sentiment of mankind is against the surrender of the political exile to death or other grievous punishment. To have lost his country for which he has been risking life is no small loss to such a man, no light punishment for what he may have done, and he may be suffered to rest in peace in his place of refuge. The principle hitherto adopted in the matter of extradition of excluding offences of a political character should therefore be maintained. But it becomes a very different thing when, in furtherance of some political or pre tended political purpose, some foul crime, such as assassination or incendiarism, is committed. Thus, attempts by conspirators to assassinate a reigning sovereign, re gardless, perhaps, that in doing so other lives may be sacrificed ; or the setting fire to a prison, at the risk of burning all those within it, or the murder of the police, for the purpose of rescuing prisoners in custody for political offences, are crimes in lespect of which—though the motive was a political one—we cannot think that any immunity should be afforded. Civil war and insurrection take place openly, in the face of day, and may, or may not, be justified or excused by circumstances; but assassination or other forms of revolting crime lose none of their atrocity from their connexion wit political motive. Generally speaking, we would therefore decline to recognise the suggestion of a political motive as a ground on which a magistrate or judge shouk le use a eman or the surrender of a person accused of what (in the absence o suci motive) wou e an ordinary crime, unless the act, to which a political charactei was soug i o e ascn e , occurred during a time of civil war or open insurrection. Cases, owever, may occur m which it would be undesirable to surrender a person accusei o a mime ms iga^ y political motive, even though a magistrate or judge could no pronounce a either civil war or open insurrection, and consequently could not discharge the accuse A 4as of right. To meet this possibility, a discretionary power, in favour of the prisoner, should be reserved to the Grovernment to refuse to deliver up a person so accused. IV.—The exclusion which we have proposed of all offences against local laws and regu lations would exclude laws of purely local interest, such as, for instance, laws relating to military or naval service, laws relating to religion, laws relating to the duties of public officers, police regulations, and the like. y.—j^ext as to the quality and degree of the crimes which should be the subject of extradition. We can see no rational ground for any limitation beyond those just referred to. With regard to all others, it may safely be assumed that a foreign Government will not seek to obtain the surrender of an offender for a merely trivial offence. It is equally reasonable to suppose that an offender will not become a fugitive from his country, unless to escape the punishment due to an offence of a serious character. We would therefore authorise extradition in respect of all offences against either person or property, indictable under our law, without reference to the degree of criminality involved in the particular charge. Confining extradition to offences against person and property, we see no necessity for any distinction between felony and misdemeanor • or for the selection of particular offences as alone of sufficient importance to warrant the surrender of criminals. With a view, however, to certainty and precision, it becomes desirable that the offences in respect of which extradition may be claimed should be specified and enumerated. yi. If the question be asked whether we should refuse to give up a fugitive where the offence in respect of which the surrender is asked for, though an offence against the law of the country asking it, is not an offence against our own, the answer is involved in what has been already said. The crimes in respect of which nations should make common cause against criminals, and refuse them shelter, are those which it is the common interest of all to repress. There are offences against society in respect of person and property, which, in all countries, there will always be found persons disposed to commit, and which can only be kept under by the strong arm of the law. It is these offences which it should be the common purpose of all nations to endeavour to suppress by preventing those who have committed them from escaping from justice. But these offences are known to and dealt with by the law of all civilised nations' though they may be differently dealt with both as to procedure and punishment. If some offence, unknown to the law of other nations—to what may figuratively be called the common law of nations—should be created by the law of a particular people, such an offence would not come within the category of crimes which it is the purpose of extradition to repress. ' r r If it be asked how it is to be ascertained that the offence charged is known and recognised as an offence, the answer is that our own law will afford a sufficient test being abundantly comprehensive as to offences against person and property. Besides which, there is another reason for seeing that the charge in respect of which extradition is asked for is an offence under our own law. It is and always must be neces sary that a pnma facie case shall be made out before a magistrate in order to support the application for extradition But the English magistrate cannot be expected to know or interpret the foreign law. It is not desirable that he should be required to do more than to see that the facts proved constitute /uah an offence which would have been within judicial cognizance if done in this country. At the game time, while holding that the facts charged against the party whose o^v that S the off f ^ T ° ffenCe ^ 0U? law ’ ^ans intend tion U *n er the fo f‘g 11 law must b e the same in point of denomina tion, or must fall within the same class or category, or be dealt with according to the TZ ZZTt?’ OT b6 t ‘i 0 th i e Same P un *shment, as it would be under ofr own. y s ch requirement is calculated to create unnecessary difficulty, and may cause tained^hat tfeTctT i° n ^ undoubtedl y take place. It being once ascer- a-tion the ntticnla, T Tf tute “ ° ffenCe comin g w,thin the principle of extra- forehn?aw P thk bl f +r ^ ohamcter which the offence assumes must be left to the Lyond Xonerttn ?f law Whl u h - IS a leged t0 haVe been broken, and by which, determined ^ The ^ a “ used 18 surrendered, his guilt or innocence must be determined, ihe magistrate, therefore, should be authorised to grant extradition unon sufficient prvmd facte proof before him of facts which constitute »ext^although the description of the offence in the demand, or in the documents produced in support of it, or the facts as therein stated, may not be sufficient to constitute the particular offence to which that description is appropriated by British law: in other words, the magistrate should look to the facts proved before him rather than to the form in which the case may be presented on the documents. In this respect there can be no distinction between the case of a British subject, if surrendered, and that of a subject of the foreign State. The British subject, while within the foreign State, owes obedience to its law as though he had been'one of its subjects, and is as much amenable to that law for a violation of it as a natural-born subject would be. YII.—A question presents itself whether, if a person be surrendered in respect of one extradition offence, he should, when transferred to the country claiming him, be liable to be tried for another. Political and local offences being excepted, we see no reason why he should not. So far as we are aware, the main ground hitherto put forward for objecting to such a course has been the apprehension that a foreign government, having obtained the surrender of a criminal on an ordinary charge, might put him on his trial for a political offence. If the offences just referred to be excluded, there seems to be no other case in which it can be suggested that a foreign government would act disingenuously towards ours if it were to put the person surrendered on his trial in respect of a crime which was not the ground of extradition in the particular instance. If there be another accusation against him in respect of a crime which would properly be the subject of extradition, we see no reason why he should not be called upon to answer it. It mav be discovered after the surrender that the party surrendered has committed some other offence deserving of punishment; or proofs, previously wanting, of such other offence may be brought to light. We see no reason why under such circumstances the offender should escape with impunity. If the circumstances under which he was given up were such as to call for his surrender, what possible interest except in the case of the political offender, or the offender against a merely local law can we have in what becomes of him afterwards? We should not be warranted in assuming that he will be dealt with in the foreign country otherwise than according to justice and right. Again, what is it that we are supposed to be entitled to claim under such circumstances? It can only be that the party shall be set at large, or restored to this country, when, on the evidence which would be available on the second trial, his surrender might again be claimed from this or any other country bound by an extradition treaty, and if claimed, must be conceded. The case is no doubt possible, that a person whose surrender was asked for on an ordinary charge might be put on his trial for a political or local offence. But such a case is not likely to occur. In the first place, it being known that this country refuses to deliver up persons charged with such offences, if a foreign government were to obtain the surrender of a prisoner on the pretence of trying him for an offence m respect of which extradition can be claimed, for the purpose of trying him for an offence in respect of which it cannot; or, having obtained his surrender m respect of one of the former class, should take the opportunity of proceeding against him on one ot the latter its conduct would be disingenuous and dishonest, and would give rise to well- founded and serious complaint g on the part of the Government of this conn r^ ■Rot such a oroceeding may easily be guarded against. It should be expiessy stimulated in 1 any treaties entered'into that a person surrendered on a particular charge should not be tried for any other offence, unless of an extraditional charac er, and In all cases in which the surrender takes place otherwise than under treaty, the surrender should be made on the same condition. As regards political offenders such r&amp;z- r . r j sesjax nor the magistrates in this country would be likely to know ^ individual himself, however, cannot be ignoia ormortunitv to show, not only therefore, desirable that the accused shou c ave v- t be tried for the crime in that there is not a sufficient case for surrenderm^ his respect of which his surrender is demanded, but also that it is intended, A 16018. Bsurrender to try or arbitrarily punish him for some offence for which he could not be surrendered; or at least that there is a risk that, if he is surrendered, he may be tried, punished, or detained for such an offence. There could indeed, seldom be strict legal evidence such as would justify a magistrate, or a court of law on habeas corpus, in finding that there was such an intention ; and an enactment that the accused person shall not be surrendered if such an intent be proved would therefore probably not be of much use, except for the purpose of satisfying the reasonable jealousy of our own people; but there seems no objection to such an enactment, unless it be, that it might offend the susceptibilities of foreign countries. The real practical remedy seems to be that the accused should have a right to demand an inquiry ; on which inquiry there should be no restriction on the kind of evidence to be received, except that imposed by common sense; and that if the result of that inquiry should be that in the opinion of the Government a proper case has been made out discretion should be given to the Government in favour of the accused, either to refuse to deliver him up at all, or to require, before delivering him up, a specific engagement from the foreign Government that if acquitted of the crime for which he is demanded, or when he has suffered the punishment of that crime, he shall be at liberty to quit the country to which he has been surrendered. Such an engagement would probably seldom be refused. It may safely be assumed that no foreign Government would be so lost to a sense of its own honour and interest as to violate a pledge so given. If it were, the Order in Council enabling a surrender to that foreign Government should at once be revoked. If these or similar precautions are adopted, there seems no reason why the foreign Government should, as a general rule, be required to engage not to try the person for any other extradition crime than the one in respect of which his surrender was obtained. It is obviously a serious objection to such a restriction that, if a person has been guilty of more than one extradition offence, either the foreign Government must bring to this country evidence of every crime which may be charged against the accused, the delay and expense of which would be very great, or the offender would escape in respect of all other crimes committed by him save the one on which he was surrendered. Moreover, it may well happen that the evidence of the one crime does not come out till the trial of the other. The proposal that, before putting the person surrendered upon trial for another extradition offence, the consent of the surrendering Government should be required, seems objectionable, not only as occasioning expense and trouble to the prosecutors, but as entailing on the accused a detention in prison whilst the two Governments are negotiating. If the prisoner should be ultimately acquitted this might be a serious hardship. And its sole object seems to be to provide against a remote possibility of wrong, which, if the precautions above suggested are taken, would be sufficiently excluded. VIII.—The existing statutes do not contain any provisions respecting the procedure to be adopted in this country, when application is about to be made to a foreign State for the surrender of an alleged criminal to Great Britain; and we learn, from Sir James Ingham, that the want of such provisions is sometimes a source of difficulty and incon venience. It is the usual (and, in our opinion, the proper) course, for a warrant, for the arrest of the accused person, to be applied for and granted upon a sworn information; which, although sufficient to justify the British magistrate in issuing the warrant, may not (even in those cases in which it is necessary or proper to proceed on ex parte evidence) be deemed sufficient to authorise the surrender by the foreign State. We think it is desirable that, in all cases, the evidence in support of the charge should be made as complete as possible, before the warrant is granted, but, for the purpose of supplying any accidental or unavoidable omissions in that evidence, we think the British magistrate should have power (which he is not now considered to possess) to receive and certify any supplementary depositions which may be offered to be sworn before him, and which the foreign jurisdiction may be willing to receive, after', as well as before the issue of the warrant. We recommend that provision for this purpose, as well as for regulation of the procedure before British magistrates in cases where extradition is to be obtained from another country, in accordance with the practice of which we have expressed our approval, should be made by law. A cognate subject, to which (though it may not come strictly within the scope of our Commission) we think it right to advert is that of the means of following,be tried. No sufficient means, for this purpose, are now provided by law • and it i° obviously desirable that this defect should be supplied. Inasmuch, however as we are informed, that this subject has recently been, and is still, under the careful con sideratiou of Her Majesty’s Government, we do not think it necessary to dwell upon it any further. 1 1 X. —A valuable auxiliary in detecting crime and also in frustrating its purpose is as is well known, to be found in the power of searching the premises of the accused or other place to which he may be believed to have transferred stolen property or other indicia of crime. And it is frequently essential to the efficacy of such a search that it should be made contemporaneously with, or, indeed, sometimes prior to, the arrest of the alleged offender. In the exercise of his ordinary jurisdiction in respect of a crime committed in this country, a magistrate has authority, upon a sworn information, to issue a search warrant at any time, whether before, after, or at the time of issuing the warrant for the apprehension of the accused. In the case of an extradition offence the power of the magistrate, as given by section 9 of the Act of 1870, arises only “ when the fugitive criminal is brought before him.” The effect of which is that in the interval between the apprehension of the accused and his being brought before the magistrate, ample opportunity is afforded to any friend or associate of the prisoner to remove stolen property, which it may be impossible after wards to recover, or papers or other articles, which, like the stolen property, might afford material evidence of his guilt. We are of opinion that this defect in the existing statute should be amended, and that the power of the magistrate in this particular should be put on the same footing in respect of an extradition offence as in respect of an offence committed in this country and coming within his ordinary jurisdiction. XI. —By the third section of the statute referred to “ a fugitive criminal shall not be “ surrendered until the expiration of 15 days from the date of his being committed to “ prison to await his surrender;” and by section 11 “if the police magistrate commits “ a fugitive prisoner to prison, he shall inform such criminal that he will not be “ surrendered until after the expiration of 15 days, and that he has a right to apply “ for a writ of habeas corpus” We are informed by the chief magistrate that, while applications for extradition are numerous, applications for writs of habeas corpus in cases of extradition are rare, and that when information is thus given to the fugitive criminal, as required by the statute, he almost invariably desires that he may be sent off at once. Sir J. Ingham suggests, therefore, that where the fugitive criminal, having been duly informed of the provision in question, declines to avad himself of the opportunity intended to be given him of applying for a writ ol habeas corpus with a view to his liberation, and desires to be surrendered at once, it should be competent to the magistrate to commit him, and to certify to the Secretary of State that such request has been made, and thereupon the Secretary of State should be enabled to surrender him forthwith. We concur in this suggestion. The only pur pose of the statutory provision is to enable a prisoner to obtain the protection of the law, if entitled to it. If he desires to waive the right thus given him, the delay becomes useless to him and vexatious to those asking for his surrender. XII.—Foreign police authorities often make communications to the police authoi ities in this country by telegram. In this way it becomes known that a foreign warrant has been issued for the apprehension of a person accused of an extradition crime, 'w o either is already in this country, or is expected to come by a ship then on i s voyage. There is in such cases no reasonable doubt of the truth of the information us sen ry telegraph; but as the law now stands, the magistrates and the police m ns coun ry cannot legally act until the foreign warrant and the evidence m support ot it arrive cmri m elio moQTvi.imA eliA ‘fno’ifivp has the oDDortunity of escaping.authorise any constable to arrest such person, and bring him before the magistrate, who should then have power to remand him for a reasonable time, or discharge him, as to him might seem just. To meet the cases, said not to be uncommon, where even the short delay occasioned by applying to a magistrate may be important, power might be given to the Home Secretary to select in each police district some of the superior police to be authorised to act in such cases. And constables of this class might be authorised, on reasonable grounds of suspicion that a person was a fugitive_ guilty of an extradition crime, to arrest him without warrant, and bung him forthwith before a justice of the peace, who should have power, as to him might seem just, either to direct the prisoner to be brought at once before a police magistrate, or to remand him, or to discharge him. Such a power would be useful, and thus guarded, would not be likely to be abused. XIH. There is in the law relating to extradition, as it at present exists, a defect, by which extradition is liable to be frustrated, and to which, therefore, we think it necessary to call attention. It is that in the existing statutes no provision is made for dealing with the case of a criminal, who, having been surrendered by one foreign State to another, may be brought into British territory on his way from the one country to the other. A case has recently presented itself, which, though it did not occur on British territory, will fully illustrate what we mean. A man charged with having committed forgery in the United States was surrendered by the Peruvian Government to that of the United States. On his way to the latter country he had to be conveyed across the territory of Columbia. There being no extradition treaty between the Government of Columbia and that of the United States, the prisoner, who having committed no offence against the Columbian law, was entitled by that law to his liberty, was set at large by the local authority. The same thing might, under the present law, happen in this country, even though there were an existing treaty between Great Britain and the State to which the surrender had been made, unless, indeed, a fresh demand for the extradition of the criminal were made, and the evidence neces sary to support it were forthcoming in this country, which very possibly might not be the case. If, for instance, to take a possible case, a man, surrendered by the French Government to that of Germany or Holland, were landed in this country, to be conveyed by land to a port on our eastern coast, to be thence shipped to his place of destination, the man would be entitled to be set free, unless a case sufficient to found a demand for extradition could at once be established here. The same thing might happen if a ship, on which the prisoner had been embarked, being either a British ship or a foreign passenger ship, came in the course of transit into our waters. If the vessel were a ship of war it would depend on how far our courts would be prepared to treat such ship as part of the territory of the nation to which she belonged, and, as such, exempt from the jurisdiction of our law. We recommend that statutory provision should be made to meet such a case, should it occur. With this view we suggest that it should be made competent to any justice of the peace, on the application of any consul of the State to whose officer a prisoner has been surrendered, or of any officer having charge of him, and on production of any warrant or other documents showing that the prisoner has been surrendered on the charge of having committed an extradition offence, to issue a warrant authorising his detention and transfer through and from British territory to the place to which it is desired to convey him. And, further, that it shall be a sufficient answer to an applica tion for a writ of habeas corpus to show, in like manner, by the production of a warrant or other authentic document, that the prisoner has been surrendered in respect of an extradition offence. We further recommend that endeavours should be made to obtain a corresponding provision in our own favour in treaties between this country and foreign States. XIV. If our suggestions should be adopted, further legislation will be necessary. &lt; ^ is desirable that this legislation should be complete in itself. The means pro vided by the existing Acts for the fulfilment of engagements entered into by this country in any existing treaties must remain in force for that purpose, so long as those treaties continue. But extradition under future treaties, or the power, if it is thought expedient to give it, of surrendering to foreign Governments without any treaty, should be regulated by an Act complete in itself without reference to any previous legislation.13 It may be assumed that the machinery for putting the Act in force, so far as relates to extradition to foreign countries, will be the same in substance as that which is provided by the present Acts. But, if the suggestions which we have made are adopted, many of the provisions of those Acts (especially such as are contained in sections 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 19 of the Act of 1870), will require material alteration. We do not recommend any change in the principle of existing Imperial legislation on this subject as regards the Colonies and foreign possessions of the Crown, as already contained in the Act of 1870. A. E. COCKBUm SELBORNE. BLACKBURN. RUSSELL GURNEY. RICHARD BAGGALLAY. WM. BALIOL BRETT. ALFRED HY. THESIGER. JOHN ROSE. J. F. STEPHEN. W. Y. HARCOURT. W. M. TORRENS (with the exception of George E. March, Secretary, Section VII., from which I feel compelled to May 30, 1878. dissent for the following reasons). It is the interest of every civilised Government to aid in the apprehension and expulsion of evil doers, who merely claim its hospitality to escape punishment. But it is not for the honour or interest of the Government of England to be made, unawares, instrumental in the pursuit and capture of fugitives from the resentment of absolute or irresponsible rulers. That such exist we know, and that they desire on various pleas the rendition of those who have offended them is not a matter of doubt ; ostensibly on political or religious grounds a demand of surrender has long ceased to be made. The settled and acknowledged policy of our Govern ment on this head may almost be thought to obviate the need of further provision by the Legislature, against a claim which has grown obsolete. The statute of 1870 was designed to guard against a different and more insidious danger, namely, that of our authorities being made use of to deliver up fugitives who have become the objects of suspicion, espionage, or persecution by arbitrary power, upon the alleged breach of some ordinary law for the protection of property or life. Every facility of primary accusation was meant to be given in the case of a foreigner resident within the realm which the criminal law affords for rendering amenable a native-born subject of the Crown. The same proof, primd facie, was declared to be sufficient, while the just and obvious rule was declaratively enacted that the refugee should ^ only be deported or detained in custody on the production of such evidence as would justify a magistrate in sending for trial any subject of the Queen for a like offence committed here. If the provisions of the Act are, in this respect, deemed insufficient aftei seven years’ experience of their application, it will be the duty of Parliament to altei an amend them. But their practical value would be put in jeopardy if the demand made by one Government, and by one only in Christendom, were conceded, that they should be so far repealed, that when an exile had been surrendered on presumptive proof of com plicity in one out of a dozen common misdemeanors, he might after acquittal on that charge be kept in custody, with a view to be put upon his trial for some other offence or offences, of which not a shadow of proof had been offered to an English magisti ate that he was possibly or probably guilty. Practically this mig e misun 00 _ an invitation to a foreign Government to deprive its subjects of . th ® of a ^ lu ^ in England, which, time out of mind, all our neighbours have enjoyed, irrespective of creed, race, or local institutions. . . Clauses 3 and 19 of the Act of 1870 were designed to prevent possibie mjustme being done to an exile, against whom an accusation may be broug wi , ^ n sufficient to warrant his committal here, but whose gui t ma y ^ , Parliament trial in the foreign country. Our executive government was forbidden by to give up any foreigner without security bylaw, or speci . °’ oteci: i on a new charge subsequently preferred against him he should ag 1 B 3of the same just and merciful provisions which he had when first accused, and our Government was reciprocally directed to forego all claim to detain and try an exile in England on a second charge after he had been duly acquitted on the first. To repeal this provision would appear to be a waiver by statute of our primary jurisdiction in the matter. Had we to deal with countries only whose jurisprudence rests upon what England deems the principles of social and political civilisation, there would perhaps be little risk in the concession. Criminal justice, as our people understand it and as our laws and courts interpret it, implies publicity of arraignment, confronting with the accuser, and the weighing of evidence by an irremovable judge, indifferent to the frown of power. It implies the verdict of a fair jury, a record open to legal scrutiny, and the fearless criticism of an unfettered press. In America, France, and other constitutional States, the hazard may be considered comparatively slight of any grave hardship arising from allowing a fugitive once surrendered to be twice or thrice indicted for different crimes. But the law of 1870 was framed to meet other circumstances as well as these, and in the hope of establishing a uniform rule in our dealings with foreign States. In lieu of the wise and just provision embodied in section HI. of the Act of 1870 above referred to, it is proposed to give the accused an opportunity of volunteering such disclosures to the Secretary of State as may possibly lead to his exacting the pledge of restoration to a place of safety on acquittal. But this practically would re-impose on the Minister of the Crown the invidious duty in exceptional cases from which, on grounds of general policy, Parliament in 1870 unanimously decided on relieving him. In truth, the fear entertained by those who are jealous of any lessening of the present safeguards against unfair and oppressive extradition, mainly rests upon the ‘ possibility of a person, when acquitted of one extradition offence, being detained in custody for an indefinite period on the imputation of one or more offences, none of which may have in them any political or religious character. Parliament cannot affect ignorance of the disparity of foreign laws, and the repug nance to our own, of the principles on which criminal justice is frequently administered under them. It is a matter of notoriety, not of argument, that the presumption of innocence, which we regard as fundamental, is not acknowledged in several of the greatest States of Rurope; but, on the contrary, that the onus of disproof lies upon the accused; and that if he be not gifted by nature with coolness, self-possession, and a leady wit, oi lucky in the possession of sufficient means to engage the services of an able advocate in meeting the imputations and insinuations of a Procureur-Imperial, he has little chance of escape, according to our notions of criminal justice. This method of dealing with such grave matters forms no part of the subject of inquiry by this Commission ; but I think we are bound to keep in remembrance practices so 'irrecon- cileable with our ideas of criminal jurisprudence, and to take care that no supposed analogy to our established forms of procedure should render the authority of the Crown subservient unintentionally to working out schemes and purposes, which public opinion m England would not approve. r It is certain, for example that within the last few years numbers of persons, suspected of sympathy with disaffection to the absolute rule of the Czar, have been T' ested , an&lt; J transported from the Grand Duchy of Warsaw to Siberia, this ninnilk' k T°i oRt 'o 11; ' ’ ''i'* that thousands of Poles have been banished in nnrl alltl f •. 1U0 ?

If he should seek refuge in exile, ought an Eiudisli Secretary of State to be liable under treaty to be called on to give him up because the magistrate at Bow Street had evidence before him of allegations that he had misused trust property by retaining or disbursing it in breach of municipal law, without a pledge from the foreign Government that, if acquitted of the charge in the sense wherein alone one of our own people could be made amenable to English law, he should be replaced within the dominions of the Queen ? The definition of what constitutes a breach of political laws, that is to say, of laws exceptionally enacted in consequence of social, ecclesiastical, or dynastic controversies is beyond the reach of our executive or judicial authority. The attempt to draw the line of distinction has frequently been made, but has always failed; and to leave the question as a nest-egg of diplomatic complication did not seem dignified or prudent in 1870, when Parliament legislated on the subject. On all hands it was then agreed that, as far as possible, the invidious discretion of giving up, or refusing to give up, the fugitive subjects of foreign Governments should be taken from the administration of the day, and reposed in the judiciary. It is indeed worthy of note that no foreign Government whatever has objected in principle to the stipulation against detention for trial upon a second charge. On behalf of the United States, Mr. Secretary Fish explicitly recognised its propriety and justice, and it was confessedly on wholly different grounds that the misunderstanding arose which has led to so much diplomatic corre spondence. The susceptibilities of America were touched, not by a proposal that this stipulation should be made reciprocal by a new treaty with Great Britain, but at being- told that the conditions of the Ashburton Treaty of 1843 had been modified by an Act of the United Parliament. It seems incredible that such a difficulty should not be capable of removal without the abnegation by our Legislature of safeguards for international justice which only seven years ago were deliberately enacted. As the misunderstanding with America turns wholly on the retrospective effect of the Act of 1870, never contemplated by Parliament, yet not unnaturally repudiated as in admissible by Congress ; there need be no difficulty in passing an Act of indemnity applicable to all past and present cases in which a surrender is made to the United States without a guarantee in the event of acquittal; with the view to a new treaty of extradition wherein an assurance against trial on a second charge shall be embodied. While the Commission has been sitting, another notable adhesion to the policy of 1870 has been given by the ratification of an amended extradition treaty on the part of France, specifically embodying the principle that a refugee acquitted on one accusation ought to be replaced within the confines of asylum before he is made amenable on any second charge.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002d6_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/D142</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002d6</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/D142</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Telegraphic Communications with Stations Abroad from the point of view of Imperial Defence.
