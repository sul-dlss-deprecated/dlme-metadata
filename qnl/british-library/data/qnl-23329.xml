No. IbZ'ljlfZ. Bahrain, November 24, 1940. z* . Dear xl loan, His Highness approved of the suggestion that the Bahrain Government might again employ an agriculturist to run the Buaeya garden ana to advise the Government and the public on general agricultural matters. He would be willing to employ an Egyptian. Regarding terms: I do not Know how much one would have to pay for a suitable man. What we require is someone with Knowledge, experience of market garden ing, growing both local and European vegetables, fruit * trees and possibly crops, though we cannot do much in the last line as few large irrigated areas are avail able. 1 think that date cultivation is fairly suc cessful here, in local hands, though an Egyptian could give us useful advise on manuring date gardens. 1 have met several agricultural experts who have been to Bahrain at various times and from my experience of them I am sure that what we need is a man with practical knowledge who would not be ashamed of work ing in the ground himself to show others how things should be done. From personal experience 1 find this is the only way to teach gardening. I thinK the most useful man we have employed was the Mosul xi.rab who was possibly not very highly qualified but who had practical experience. The Englishman from Kew who was employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company produced no results and the Indian expert6 - 2 - expert who wrote the long report on agriculture was expensive and told us little that we did not already know!

Shaikh Mohamed is personally acquinted with an Egyptian who in their opinion might be suitable and they propose that his name should be suggested and the Egyptian Agricultural Department should be asked whehther he can be recommended. He is:- I understand he has certain qualifications. I do not consider that knowledge of crops is necessary here but what is required is knowledge of date cultivation and vegetables and fruit trees. Shaikh Mohamed thinks that the man who he recommends would be willing to come for about Rs.300/- per month. Shaikh Mohamed takes more interest in agri culture than any of the other Shaikhs and I think that in this matter his opinion is valuable. Husain Mohamed, Agriculture Department Fayum, Egypt.
