O 4s ana -5 z &amp; n-b m * indeed strengthened throughout the year in spite of the impact of new develop-^ fe***^- t • n .li TUic Mai pet vs (Tnvernment Saudi Arabia. The tradition of mutual trust and friendship between King Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government continued unbroken and was i &amp; i , .1 xi l x ^ cnifo rvf fVio irrmnpf nf nPW dpveloD- x in ‘the history - V A friendship between C-gEST' maeea strengtnenea Liirouguuuc tnc m v^x ^ ^ ments, chief among them being the prospect that His Majesty s Government could no longer agree to continue their financial assistance to the Ring on t e § same scale as during 1943. Ibn Saud’s loyalty to his friends, however, remained ^ steadfast and prevailed against the counsels of those of his advisers and otticials who began to turn to the United States as the goose that could lay the biggest b 2. ^Among the most significant events of the year was the emergence into the foreground of Saudi internal affairs of the United States the closer if reluctant participation of Ibn Saud in Arab unity discussions, his increasing interest in the Yemen and King Earouk’s request to visit His Majesty. 3 The annual pilgrimage numbered some 42,000 pilgrims, approximately the same number as in 1943, and included a token pilgrimage of about 4,600 Indian for the first time since 1941. 4 rab A ffa'irs 4. Throughout the year the King adhered closely to his policy of consulting His Majesty’s Government on all matters rejating to Arab affairs, particular y Arab unity, and gave further ample proof of his wisdom and foresight. As he himself stated, he was guided throughout by three principles. (1) to main ai his own position in the Arab world and accept domination by nobody, (2) to avoid embarrassing His Majesty’s Government and their Allies in the prosecution of the war and (3) to avoid the creation of a bloc of Arab States against him. His suspicions of Hashimite intrigues remained as strong as ever. 5 In March Ibn Saud sent Sheikh Yusuf Yasm to advise Nahas Pasha to postpone the Arab Unity Conference and Nahas agreed. I he King also sent n Utter confirming this. He was deeply oftended, however, when he heard m July that Nahas had double-crossed him and invited Iraq and Syria to attend the'meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Arab Unity Conference m [62—'62] &lt;ao. X . PUu *■ } Apm* 145 j INDIA 0—Alexandria. He was incensed, too, that Nahas had not even bothered to answer his letter. In spite of a long apology from Nahas, Ibn Sand decided not to participate in the conference and told Nahas so in no uncertain terms. Finally, however, he agreed to send a delegate after the assembled Arab delegates had appealed to him in a joint telegram. Anxious not to commit himself, however, Ibn Saud instructed his representative Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to act as an observer only, thereby reserving his agreement to any resolutions until after he had studied them carefully. 6. Ibn Saud considered the Alexandria Protocol went too far and objected to anything which might conflict with the religious principles on which his kingdom was founded. On His Majesty’s Government’s advice, however, he showed himself more accommodating, although maintaining his reservation regarding religious principles. In this mood he discussed the question with A.bdur Rahman Azzam Bey, the Egyptian special envoy who came to persuade him to accept the protocol, and at the end of the year there seemed a fair chance that he would do so. Later he agreed to allow his delegate to sign the protocol with certain reservations. 7. As regards the establishment of Arab propaganda offices in Washington and London Ibn Saud agreed in principle but here again was opposed to any precipitate action. He advocated that representatives of each Arab State should be sent to London and Washington bearing letters setting out the Arab case to His Majesty King George VI, President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill, and only in case these representatives advocated the establishment of propaganda offices j would he agree to it. His reluctance to agree to the establishment of these offices j i s probably due to the embarrassment he feels in not being able to contribute towards their expenses on a scale commensurate with his predominant position ] in the Arab and Moslem world. 8. Ibn Saud continued to pay the-closest attention during the year to the Palestine question which in his own words he described as “ the king-pin of Arab unity.” Though he himself admitted that as an Arab and a Moslem he could not but oppose Zionist ambitions in Palestine he never allowed his feelings to prevail over his conviction that it was not in the interests of the Arabs to raise this question during the war. One of the main reasons why he agreed to participate in the Alexandria Conference was the assurance given him by the various Arab leaders that the Palestine question would not be raised in an acute form. Quietly and without fuss Ibn Saud worked on the leaders of Egypt, Syria, the Lebanon and the Temen to damp down controversy over Palestine and avoid precipitating a crisis. The Wagner resolution, followed by the Demo cratic and Republican parties’ planks and the British Labour party resolution provoked no outbursts from Ibn Saud as they did in other Arab countries. In order to make sure that his policy was in accordance with His Majesty’s Govern ment s wishes the King at the end of the year asked His Majesty’s Government to restate their views and agreed to be guided bv them in future discussions on Arab unity. 9. In Syria and the Lebanon Ibn Saud did his best to pour oil on troubled waters urging their leaders not to take any action prejudicial to Great Britain and her Allies while the war continued. Early in the year he took the opportunity of visits from Jamil Mardam and Riyadh as Sulh to emphasise this point of view. He was, as usual, in constant touch with Shukri Kuwatli on whom he exercises considerable influence. He was dismayed when Shukri accepted Nahas’s invitation to the Alexandria Conference and tried hard to dissuade him. When Shukri appealed to him to support his protest against the proposed conclusion of a treaty with France Ibn Saud replied that he had himself to blame because of his intransigent attitude towards the French. He advised Shukri to follow His Majesty’s Government’s advice and warned him not to embarrass them in Syria. Although concerned over the question of a treaty with France Ibn Saud was reassured when His Majesty’s Government declared that their policv regarding Syria remained unchanged. ‘ ^ 10. The Iman Yehya, whom the King describes as a man living out of touch with the world, came increasingly under his influence during the year and allowed himself to be guided by the King’s wise counsels, not only over such seemintov remote issues as Arab unity but also over matters directly affecting the Iman as for instance, the Haudh al Ma dispute. As regards the former, the Iman on Ibn Saud’s advice, sent a delegate to the Alexandria Conference with the’role of an tc observer.” Over the dispute with the Government of Aden he accepted the King’s strong hint to climb down and evacuated Haudh al Ma3 [62—62] B 2 Relations with Foreign Powers. 11. King Ibn Sand continued to remain His Majesty’s Government’s firm friend and consulted them, as always in the past, on all major matters affecting the external and internal affairs of his kingdom. His trust in them remained unshaken, although anxiety about the future darkens the horizon. With the Americans he kept his relations on a friendly but not too intimate basis and, while naturally welcoming their increased assistance to his country, made it clear to his sons and officials and to the Americans themselves that he regarded His Majesty’s Government as his first friends and would always do so. Ibn Saud is cautious towards the Americans for to him the shadow of Zionism looms behind all their activities in the Middle East; on the other hand, he is prepared to reap j such advantages as he can from a rich friend like America. 12. The great Allied victories of 1944, culminating in the invasion of France, were sincerely welcomed by the King, who, as our staunchest friend in the Middle East in this war, has stood firm even in the darkest hour. 13. Relations with Egypt suffered somewhat owing to Nahas’s discourteous treatment of the King, and it may be that King Farouk had this in mind when, towards the end of the year, he asked to visit Ibn Saud. The latter agreed, but preferred to postpone the meeting until after the pilgrimage, i.e., towards the end of January. 14. 'There was some tension in Saudi relations with Iraq at the beginning of the year owing to the frontier measures adopted by the Iraqi Government to prevent the smuggling of sheep from Iraq. Ibn Saud was highly incensed and threatened retaliatory action, but the measures were subsequently relaxed. The joint Saudi-Iraqi commission appointed to settle minor frontier disputes worked smoothly and efficiently during the year. The Haram incident at Mecca during the 1943 pilgrimage did not make Ibn Saud any more popular with Iraqi Shias and, mainly as a result of Shia agitation, only some 400 Iraqi pilgrims came on the Haj j in 1944 compared with 1.500 the previous year. Needless to say Ibn Saud was not perturbed at this development. 15. Owing to the King’s close personal friendship with Shukri Kuwatli relations with Syria were excellent. The King’s influence, moreover, played a large part in Syria’s relations with other Arab States and the Great Powers. During the year the Saudi Consulate-General in Damascus was raised to a legation. Although no Syrian representative had yet been appointed to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year the head of the Syrian pilgrimage delegation described himself as temporary representative of his Government and issued visas for Syria. The French Legation, who have hitherto represented Syrian interests in Saudi Arabia, did not object. As regards the Lebanon, the King early in the year wished to appoint Hussain al Uwaini, his trade agent in Beirut and a notorious character, as first Saudi Minister to the Lebanon, but, on His Majesty’s Government’s request, abandoned the proposal. 16. The Haram incident during the 1943 pilgrimage nearly provoked a break in Saudi relations with Persia. In reply to a telegram from the Shah, King Ibn Saud sent a letter justifying his action and there the matter appeared to rest, but relations remained at best strained for the rest of the year. The ban imposed by the Persian Government on pilgrims for the 1944 pilgrimage indicated the mood they were in. 17. Evidence of Ibn Saud’s keen interest in, and possible designs on, the »Yemen was to be seen in the despatch of a special envoy to Sana’ to advise the Imam to improve his relations with Britain and to warn him to put his house in j order. The envoy, on his return, reported great dissatisfaction among the people ( with the Imam’s regime and a strong desire to place themselves under the rule of Ibn Saud. 18. With the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan the King maintained outwardly correct and friendly relations and there were no serious frontier disputes. The Amir, however, indulged in some gratuitous criticism of the way Ibn Sand allowed American companies to operate on the soil of the Holy Lands. Ibn Saud sent the Amir a firm reply refuting his criticisms and telling him not to listen to false rumours. The King also had cause to complain during the year to His Majesty’s Government of some wild statements which the Amir 'was reported to have made regarding a possible invasion of Saudi Arabia by his forces. 19. On His Majesty’s Government’s advice the King agreed to recognise the Provisional French Government. Relations with Turkey were normal.4 Finance and Su'p'plies. r, i- n f 20. Early in the year His Majesty’s Minister warned the Sa ' d ' that the subsidy which His Majesty’s Government had granted £ theJSaud^ Government during the war vears to oftset falling pilgrim 0 , multiplied each year until it now bore no relation to pilgrimage revenue^ that, owing to the war situation. His Majesty’s Government would n the future ^ have to restrict the subsidy to the actual requirements of the cou y- g be difficult in the post-war period, when, judging the future by P ’ ,, , of economy would sweep over Great Britain and, indeed, over vthinff United Nations, for His Majesty’s Government to justify a subsld y ° n ^ like the scale of that accorded in 1943. The Saudi Government were therefor^ advised to take measures for the reorganisation of their finances and economy m order to avoid anv crisis likely to arise from a drastic reduction or indeed a cessation of subsidies in the immediate post-war period which might threaten “e internal stability of the country. They were told that this could best be done by reducing their expenditure and increasing their revenue by the larger sale ol goods and the sale of foreign exchange to merchants. They were reminded o, that His Majesty’s Government had only granted the subsidy to offset falling pilgrimage revenues, which were now accruing to the Saudi Government on something approaching the pre-war scale, thanks to the facilities which His Maiesty’s Government had created for pilgrims to visit the Holy Lana. 21 The Kino- asked His Majesty’s Minister to discuss the whole matter witlfhim at Riyadh. His Majesty admitted the need for financial reform and showed his desire for improvement by dismissing Is ejib Salim, his Uruze Direc o of Mines and Public Works, who had long Exploited his position to line his own pockets. He replaced him by Izzet Din Shawa, a refugee Palestinian who enjoyed the King’s confidence and lias proved honest and reliable. The King also asked for a British Moslem financial adviser. At the same time, however, and while admitting the need for reform, the King pointed out that this was a long-term policy and could only be effected gradually, especially m a country like Saudi Arabia. He stressed the present penury of his realm and the need for immediate assistance, particularly as the last pilgrimage dues which had been paid abroad had not yet accrued to the Government. . , , . 22. At the end of March His Majesty’s Government submitted their new programme of assistance to the King. Its main points were a free gi t o 200 000 sovereigns and the cancellation of the Saudi Government s debt of 20 million riyals to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation against the revenue derived from the pilgrimage tariff items. While accepting it m principle Ibn Saud pressed for the payment to the Government of the pilgrimage dues, which under the baneful influence of his advisers and the attitude of Mr. Landis, had now become a very sore point with him. In the meantime a useful bargaining counter had turned up in the shape of a generous America which offered to make UP any reduction which His Majesty’s Government were for any reason obliged to make in their assistance to the Saudi Arabian Government. A group of the Kind’s advisers and officials, notably Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, realised that this was the easy and profitable wav out and played on the Kind’s natural anxietv for his country in order to get the best deal. Abdullah Suleiman in particular/was opposed to any reform which would weaken the position of Minister of Finance, which he had successfully and most profitably held since 1932. He and many others feared the prospect of a new order m Arabia and their attitude, though entirely censurable, is understandable and shared by the majority of their fellows in Government positions m every Arab country though not by the commercial community or the population m general. 23 The°Kind’s attitude towards His Majesty’s Government s otter subse quently stiffened aSd it was clear that he felt that he could not manage with the help they were willing to give him. At this stage the Americans stepped in, and when the British proposals were discussed with Mr. Landis and other American Middle East Supply Centre representatives, they criticised them as too drastic and argued that if the financial and economic stability of the country were to be maintained on a reasonable basis greater assistance was needed. Owing to the wide divergence of views the matter was referred to Cairo for discussion between the British and American Middle Last Supply Centre authorities and later to Washington and London. From May to late July the matter was thrashed out on both sides of the Atlantic, but it was obvious that if the principles of friendly collaboration in Saudi Arabia, as in the whole of the Middle East, which had been agreed upon as a result of the visit of Wallace Murray to London, were to mean anything, a satisfactory agreement regardingOil .—The construction of a refinery at Dhahran with a capacity of 50,000 barrels a day and a pipeline between Ras Tanura and Bahrain. In 5 joint Anglo-American assistance to King Ibn Sand was essential. Finally, the State Department and the Foreign Office agreed that the subsidy to Saudi Arabia should be a joint one shared equally between the United States and His Majesty s Government and that any approach to the Saudi Government on finance and supply matters should in future be made jointly. Accordingly a joint supply programme for 1944 was communicated to the King at Riyadh at the beginning of August. Briefly it consisted of an overall supply programme comprising supplies allocated to Saudi Arabia under the Middle Last Supply Centre programme, supplied through commercial channels and paid for by importing merchants, and a supply programme of essential commodities supplied by His Majesty’s Government and the United States in the form of a subsidy. In addition, His Majesty’s Government undertook to provide £10,000 a month to cover the cost of Saudi missions abroad and the United States to provide 10 million riyals on credit Lend-Lease. At first the King asked for still further help, but after some of his requests had been met, gratefully accepted the programme. It should be noted here that His Majesty’s Government’s contri- r bution under the joint programme was additional to the sum of £450,000 paid by them to the Saudi Government as subsidy at the beginning of the year, the gift of 200,000 sovereigns, and the payment of the balance of the Saudi Govern ment’s debt to the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation after the deduction of the 1943 pilgrimage tariff revenue. 24. Anglo-American discussions regarding the 1945 joint subsidy had not yet begun at the end of the year as the State Department had not yet reached a decision on the matter. 25. The question of the financial adviser whom the King had asked for was finally dropped owing to the desire of the United States to create an Anglo- American economic mission under United States leadership, as they claimed that the United States commercial interests in Saudi Arabia were greater than those of the United Kingdom. This contention was refuted by His Majesty’s Govern ment. 26. Towards the end of the year it became apparent that the King had indeed begun to realise the necessity for re-organisation and reform of the finances and administration of the country and there were signs of this which augur well for the future. (See below, paragraphs 36 and 39.) 27. An agreement was signed in October between the Saudi Government and Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Company, under which the latter granted the Government a loan of £100.000 against the security of the 1944 pilgrimage revenues. The purpose of this loan was to provide the Government with funds which, owing to the collection of the pilgrimage dues abroad, were not imme diately available to them. Activities of the United States. 28. Much greater activity in Saudi affairs was displayed by the Americans during 1944 than in previous years. The staff of their Legation was greatly increased, and the former Minister Resident replaced by a full Minister, Colonel William A. Eddy, a member of the Office of Strategic Services, with long experi ence of the Middle East and a good knowledge of Arabic. In finance and supplies the United States became an equal partner with His Majesty’s Government as described above. In addition to the assistance granted to the Saudi Government under the subsidy, which included ten million lend-lease riyals, some three million dollars were advanced by the Arabian American Oil Company (formerly the California Arabian Standard Oil Company). The United States Government also advanced to the Saudi Government, under Lend-Lease, a further sum of 10 million riyals to meet the riyal requirements of the Oil Company, the Mining Company, and the United States Legation in Jedda. The dollar proceeds of these sales to the companies and the Legation were credited to a Saudi account in Washington, 60 per cent, being retained to pay for the silver content and the minting of the riyals and the balance placed at the free disposal of the Saudi Government, with permission to purchase gold if required. The National City Bank of New York also began negotiating with the Government for the establish ment of branches in Dhahran and Jedda. In all this the Americans’ desire, naturally enough, wa's to play mother bountiful to the Saudis in order to strengthen their position in the country. Notable among increasing American activities were:—6 addition there was the proposal to lay a pipe-line across Arabia to the Mediterranean. Aviation. —The United States Government early in the year asked the King for permission to construct airfields at Riyadh, Jedda and Dhahran to facilitate j their ferrying service to the Ear East, but he refused. I he question of the ! Dhahran airfield was again raised later, but the Americans do not for the J moment appear to be pressing it. A request to establish an air-training centre in the Hejaz to train Saudi pilots was also refused by the King. Military Training and Arms. —A joint Anglo-American gift of arms and equipment was made to the Saudi Government, the United States supplying mainly rifles, automatic weapons and transport. American insistence on equal participation with the British in training and equipping the Saudi army led to the establishment in Taif of an American and a British military training team. | The idea of a British Moslem military mission which the King had requested I earlier in the year was dropped. The Americans also offered to train Saudi personnel in Egypt. A griculture. —An American mission of eight experts was accepted by Ibn Sand in order to assist the development of agricultural pursuits in Saudi Arabia. The first members of the mission arrived at the end of December. Roads. —The Americans made an aerial survey of the country during the year ostensibly to facilitate the alignment of the proposed north-south and east-west highways, which they had offered to construct, but in reality to gain a greater knowledge of the physical features of the country and to assist the oil company to ascertain the probable oil-bearing areas in Saudi Arabia. A ground party also operated for a short period from Taif. Wireless. —A request by the Arabian-American Oil Company to establish a { wireless station at Dhahran for direct communication with America was referred by the King to His Majesty’s Government, and at the end of the year was under ‘ discussion between Washington and London. Consulates. —On His Majesty's Government’s advice the King agreed to the ! appointment at Dhahran of an American consul to look after the affairs of the j increasing number of oil company's employees. Education .—The Americans offered facilities for a number of Saudi students ! to study at the American University, Beirut. Propaganda. —Towards the end of the year there was a considerable increase in the distribution of material received from the Office of War Information and an Arabic-speaking attache of the Legation was put in charge of the work. Pilgrimage. 29. The number of pilgrims arriving in the Hejaz was about 42,000, as last year, and included for the first time since 1941 a token pilgrimage of some 4,600 pilgrims from India. No special financial arrangements were made by His Majesty's Government, as in 1943, to assist the Saudi Government, and the latter fixed their own tariff rates abroad, which were considerably higher than for 1943. As a result there was considerable criticism of the Government and only some 10,000 Egyptian pilgrims arrived, as compared with over 16,000 in 1943. Generally speaking, however, the pilgrimage was a success and there were no hitches in transport and supply matters. Shipping arrangements were as last year co-ordinated in Cairo by the office of the Minister Resident in co-opera tion with His Majesty’s representatives in the various countries concerned. There was the usual close collaboration between His Majesty’s Legation and the Saudi Government on all pilgrimage matters. As last year, these combined efforts played a large part in ensuring the smooth working of the pilgrimage. 30. King Ibn Saud did not come on the pilgrimage, but was represented instead by the Amir Faisal, who made no speech at the annual banquet for pilgrims at Mecca. 31. There were no incidents during the pilgrimage. As already stated, the Persian Government refused to allow their pilgrims to do the Hajj. Six Soviet Moslem pilgrims from the Central Asian Republics arrived in the Hejaz, the first to come from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics since 1927. Middle East Supply Centre. 32. 1944 saw a rapid expansion in the organisation and control of the Middle East Supply Centre in Saudi Arabia. As a concession to the Americans, an American head'of the centre was appointed early in the year. An Anglo- American-Saudi Co-ordinating Committee was set up to deal with the demands of local merdhants and regulate imports through merchant channels. The2 7 Middle East Supply Centre became the machinery for the supply to Saudi Arabia of all commodities included in the Anglo-American subsidised supply programme. As such it ensured the arrival before the end of the year of most of the essential commodities such as cereals, tea, sugar, vehicles and spare parts included in the joint programme. The shipment of cotton piece-goods was unfortunately delayed owing to technical difficulties with the Government of India and of the 1,000 tons programmed from that country and some 430 tons under Lend-Lease from the United States of America only some 380 tons had arrived by the end of the year. Royal Family. 33. King Ibn Sand’s health took yet another year, a year iull of new developments and activities, in its stride without visible effort. He continued .to show himself as able and energetic as ever in the conduct of the multitudinous !affairs of his Kingdom. There were no tribal troubles and public security Sremained excellent. In May the Commander-in-chief, Middle Last, General Sir Bernard Paget, visited the King at his huntino' camp north of Riyadh, together with His Majesty’s Minister. At the end of December the King came down to Mecca to prepare for the meeting with King Farouk. The Amir Sand has been appointed Commander-in-chief of the Saudi army and the Amir Mansur Minister of Defence. The latter accompanied His Majesty’s Minister on a visit to Khartoum to inspect facilities for training Saudi army personnel (see paragraph 34). Miscellaneous. 34. Military Training and A rms. —(Reference paragraph 28.) Of the joint Anglo-American gift of arms the British share comprised heavy equipment such as armoured cars, anti-tank guns and mortars, in addition to lorries. Instruction of Saudi army personnel in the use of these was begun in June. Arrangements were also in hand at the end of the year for Saudis to be trained in the Sudan and Egypt as drivers and mechanics. 35. ' Locusts. —^The large British locust mission which began operating in Saudi Arabia at the end of 1943 completed a successful campaign in June 1944. A second campaign was under way at the end of the year, but on a reduced scale owing to lack of transport. The' Saudi Government are becoming more locust- minded and are co-operating with the mission by furnishing regular locust and rainfall reports. 36. Agriculture. —Increasing attention was paid during the year by the Middle East Supply Centre to the question of agricultural development in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Government were represented at the Middle East Agricul tural Conferences in Cairo and elsewhere, and a Middle East Supply Centre mission visited Saudi Arabia in March to study the possibilities of developing A1 Kharj, the Government agricultural centre near Riyadh. A report was drawn up with recommendations and submitted to the King later in the year. As a result, the administration of A1 Kharj, which has long been an expensive white elephant, was cleaned up and efforts are now being made to place it on a sound economic basis. 37. Education. —Evidence of Ibn Saud’s appreciation of the need for a j wider education of the youth of his country was shown by his agreement to the proposed appointment of a number of British Moslem teachers in Saudi schools |to teach English and to the education of selected Saudi students at Victoria College and in the Sudan. Unfortunately, Victoria College was at the last moment unable to accept them, but arrangements were subsequently made for the sons of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and a Jedda merchant to enter the college. Books and sports equipment were presented to the Saudi Education Department during the year by the British Council. 38. Roads. —A small party of Royal Engineers operated for some months in the Hejaz instructing Saudi road gangs in the work of repairing some of the worse stretches of the Jedda-Riyadh highway. 39. Transport. —The new Director of Mines and Public Works, Izzet Din Shawa, who is also Director of Transport, began on a large-scale reorganisation of the Government garage at Jedda. Corrupt officials were dismissed and a number of Egyptian technical experts appointed. As a result it is hoped that the transport situation will improve. 40. Wireless. —A number of Saudi operators were trained by the Eastern Telegraph Company in Port Sudan and six were sent to Cairo for special training by the British Overseas Airways Corporation with a view to operating the new8 wireless telegraphy station which was erected in Jedda at the end of the year for communication with aircraft. 41. Meteorological .—A selected Saudi operator was trained in Iraq by the Royal Air Force. King Ibn Baud also agreed to operate at Saudi expense certain meteorological stations which had been established in Saudi Arabia as a result of the visit of a Royal Air Force meteorological party in 1943. 42. Commercial .—The Basra manager of the Eastern Bank visited Jedda to discuss with the Saudi Government the opening of branches at Jedda and A1 Khobar. It was decided, however, to postpone definite proposals and await the outcome of negotiations between the National City Bank of New York and the Saudi Government (see paragraph 28). Reference paragraph 25 of report for 1943. The Netherlands Trading Society continued its operations during the year. It is thought that the necessary gold is imported from Egypt through the Netherlands Legation. 43. Concessions. —Lieutenant-Colonel de Gaury visited Saudi Arabia at the end of the year on behalf of a British company in order to negotiate with the Saudi Government for the grant of a concession to exploit minerals other than oil. The Government agreed to grant him a preferential position for one year provided his terms were not less favourable than any others offered to the Government during that period.( c.o, i Yi4. l '3 i &gt;y i h.torj} ■ JS 4** !ND£af THIS OOGUME sIrH CONFIDENTIAL IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT 30 MAR W* f) ARABIA.

HIS Majesty’s Government’s relations with the King and Government of Saudi Arabia were most cordial throughout the year, and Ibn Saud gave multiple evidence of his friendship and complete trust in His Majesty’s Government. 2. The high lights of the year were the departure of the Vichy Minister and the withdrawal of the Saudi Minister from Vichy, the departure of the German and Italian internees, both military and civil, Ibn Saud’s attitude over the question of Arab unity, the greater interest being shown in this country by the United States, and, finally, a successful pilgrimage of some 42,000 persons, marred only by one unhappy incident mentioned in the body of this report. 3. Mr. Stonehewer-Bird left Jedda on the 15th December, 1942, and Mr. T. Wikeley acted as His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires until the 2nd September, 1943, when Mr. Jordan arrived. The latter left for Riyadh soon after his arrival and presented his credentials to His Majesty the King in person on the 19th September, 1943. Arab Affairs. 4. The Arabs probably made more noise and caused more ink to flow (activities in which they are highly proficient) during 1943 than in any recent year. The ball of Arab unity, more or less quiescent at the opening of the year, was given a hefty kick in February by the Prime Minister of Iraq. The rest of the year was spent by the Arab leaders in pushing the ball back and forth in an indecisive and unco-ordinated manner. Never once did a team emerge capable of planting the ball firmly between the goal posts. Ibn Saud was, naturally, interested in the game, but his efforts were largely confined to pushing the ball, of which he has lively suspicions, away from him whenever it threatened to approach. If, in spite of his efforts, it came too close, he appealed to the referee (His Majesty’s Government) either to take it away from him or to tell him how and where to kick it. If other Arab leaders had shown the same faith in the referee’s honour and wisdom, much unnecessary trouble would have been avoided. 5. Ibn Saud believes that Arab countries should be independent, but he is far too wise and knows the Arabs far too well to hope that they will be able to sink their petty jealousies to form a strong federation for a long time to come. [51—38] B n.2 Until that distant day he considers that His Majesty’s Government must con- tinue to guide and control the destinies of the Arab woild. i i 6. Ibn Sand is deeply suspicious of the rulers of Iraq, Iransjordai a Egypt, and he realises they feel the same about him. 11ns suspicion c ^ lou all tne King’s reactions to the various proposals put forward during the yeai regarding Arab unity and allied matters. General IS urn s proposa , car y 111 the year, for a ioint demarche of the Arab States to His Majesty s oveinmejjjfc^ and the United States Government regarding Palestine was coldly received by- Ibn Saud, who refused to move unless given a lead by His Majesty s Government. In particular, he was reluctant to bring the United States into the picture, though he eventually approached the United States Government himse m le shape of a personal letter to President Roosevelt (see paragraph 13 below). e various proposals for an Arab conference which were produced by several Ara leaders throughout the year found Ibn Saud equally reluctant, especially as at one stage, he thought Nuri Pasha and Nahas Pasha were trying to leave him out in the cold. Apart from his innate suspicions of Nuri and Nahas, he thought and no doubt rightly, that such a conference would achieve nothing except general confusion and possible embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government and the Allies in their war effort. It was only when the idea of a full conference was abandoned in favour of a series of confidential talks between Aral) leaders m Cairo, and then only after repeated reassurances from His Majesty s Government, that Ibn Saud consented to move. In September he received an envoy from Nahas, and, later, he sent Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Cairo to confer with the Egyptian Prime Minister. 7. The general question of the future of the Arab States could not, ot course, be discussed without particular reference to Syria and Palestine. Ibn Saud is particularly interested in Syria, in the hope, possibly, that a strong and independent Syria will provide him with a useful ally against Iraq and Egypt. Nuri’s proposals for a “greater Syria,” including Palestine and Transjordan, were regarded by Ibn Saud as a device to advance tne fortunes of the Hashimite family, °and were in consequence very distasteful to him. Throughout the year, however, he wmtched the course of events in Syria w ith the greatest care, and gave valuable advice to the Syrian leaders. In particular, during the Lebanese crisis at the end of the year, he warned the Syrians and Lebanese to watch their step and to proceed only with the greatest circumspection in order to avoid providing the French with a lever for further oppressive action. 8. Palestine received its share of Ibn Saud’s attention. He submitted to His Majesty’s Government his fears regarding Zionist activities, and he received reassurances regarding His Majesty’s Government s policy. He objected to Nuri Pasha’s proposal to include Palestine in a “ greater Syria,” and he made his views regarding the Palestine question clear to the United States Government. The hope, which seems to have been held in some quarters in America, that Ibn Saud would receive Dr. Weizmann and settle the Palestine question with him, was shattered once and for all when Colonel Hoskins, President Roosevelt s personal representative, visited Riyadh in August and enquired whether the King w 7 ould receive Dr. AVeizmann. The answ 7 er was in the categorical negative, and^it revealed that, early in the war, Ibn Saud had been approached by the Zionists through the intermediary of Mr. Philby with an offer of £20 million if he would disinterest himself in the fate of Palestine. The King had con sidered himself insulted by such an offer, and his answer had been scathing. It later transpired that this money was not intended v T holly as a bribe to Ibn Saud, but rather to go towards the rehabilitation of Arabs who would be trans ferred from Palestine to areas under purely Arab control. Relations with Foreign Powers. 9. In all the mass of Arab intrigues, jealousies and mutual recriminations which were such a pronounced feature of the year, Ibn Saud took no step without consulting His Majesty’s Government and following their advice. The same is true of his increasingly important contacts with the United States of America. Indeed, far from trying to play the United States off against Britain, a bait that any ordinary Arab would have swallowed with glee, he was reluctant to commit himself too far with the United States, and he had, sometimes, to be gently pushed by His Majesty’s Government along the road to greater understanding and co-operation with that country. After Iraq’s declaration of war against the Axis, a step which Ibn Saud regarded with an ironical eye, he enquired whether His Majesty’s Government would like him to change his own attitude3 // (cf. report for 1942, second paragraph), and he would no doubt have declared war against the Axis if His Majesty’s Government had so wished, but they did not. He sent warm and undoubtedly sincere congratulations to His Majesty’s Government on the capture of Tunis and the capitulation of Italy, events which vindicated the faith he has always shown in an ultimate Allied victory, and .which increased his already great reputation as a statesman in the Arab world. /fc/ *Iis speech to notable pilgrims assembled at Mecca at the end of the year was full of praise for Britain and it will no doubt have beneficial effects far beyond the borders of Saudi Arabia. He behaved very well when, at the beginning of the year, a British army contingent entered Saudi Arabia from Transjordan without permission or previous warning, in order to carry out certain observations in connexion with the survey of Transjordan. He waited patiently for an explanation and accepted it without demur. The activities of the survey party were called off by General Headquarters. He also permitted a locust mission composed chiefly of large army units to operate throughout his domains. 10. Ibn Saud’s relations with other Powers were, on the whole, fairly good. He had various squabbles with Iraq which resulted in long wails to His Majesty’s Government regarding the way in which he was being treated by the Iraqi Government. He was particularly incensed by the institution in the summer of a zone along the Saudi-Iraqi frontier within which severe restrictions were imposed upon the movements of tribesmen and their livestock. He con sidered this an infringement of his treaty rights, which, inter alia, stipulate that Saudi tribesmen shall be free to move across and in the area in question. The other causes of friction were minor matters in themselves, but the continued failure of the Iraqi Government to pay any attention to any of Ibn Saud s protests produced an angry outburst in which the King even mentioned the possibility of resorting to force if he did not obtain satisfaction. 11. Relations with Syria were close, Ibn Saud playing the part of mentor to the Syrian leaders, who are just beginners in the hard school of politics and world affairs. Egypt and Transjordan, with whom in the past Ibn Saud’s relations have not been happy, gave him little cause for complaint in 1943. In particular there was a pleasing absence of recriminations with Transjordan about frontier violations, &amp;c. The Amir Abdulla, however, by his ill-considered manifesto concerning Arab federation in April caused Ibn Saud great offence, though he said very little about it. Relations with the Yemen were peaceful, but Ibn Saud is watching the situation in that country with great care. There were some signs that the Imam is beginning to realise the value to the Arab world of Ibn Saud’s prestige and statesmanship. Relations with the Persian Gulf States were normal and amicable. The ratification of the Koweit Agreements were exchanged at Jedda on the 1st May. 12. Ibn Saud’s relations with the United States took a big step forward during the year. The King has all along been reluctant to travel either fast or far along the road leading to closer contact with the United States. The 1 United States Government is still rather an unknown quantity for him, and he is anxious concerning the possible repercussions of extensive American activities in the Near East. He expressed his fears in at least one message to His Majesty’s Government in which he said bluntly that he preferred Britain to guide the destinies of the Arab States rather than America. He considers Britain, with her long record of co-operation with and friendship for the Arabs, can manage the Near East quite well by herself and that there is no need for America to butt in. There is some evidence to show that he fears His Majesty’s Government may decide to disinterest themselves in the Near East and allow their place to be taken by America. 13. Saudi Arabia has been declared eligible for Lend-Lease. The announcement of this was made to Ibn Saud in Riyadh by Mr. Kirk in April, and the King immediately asked His Majesty’s Government what it all meant and whether he should agree. He was reassured, and by the end of the year, after a certain quantity of badly needed Lend-Lease material had arrived, his anxiety at this new, and to him' strange, development seemed to have worn off. United States interest in Saudi Arabia, which is, of course, based on the need for oil, was also shown by the promotion of their representative in Jedda to the rank of Minister Resident, and by the unprecedented flow of American visitors, most of them official. Mr. Kirk, who was then the United States Minister to this country, visited Riyadh in April. He was followed by General Hurley and by Colonel Hoskins. These three questioned the King exhaustively on many subjects, but the main object of their visit was to discover the King’s [51—38] B 24 views on Arab questions, Palestine, Syria, &amp;c. Ibn Saud made bis views quite clear in mayy talks with these visitors and in a special message and a letter to President Roosevelt. The United States Government should therefore be fully informed of the King’s views, and they have no further excuse for the ignorance which w 7 as displayed by the President s message to Ibn Saud regarding Weizmann (see paragraph 8). . . 0k 14. Other American visitors were less important. They included, in th spring, a delegation from Life who eventually produced a long article about Saudi Arabia in their magazine which was notable for its inaccuracies and for the offence it gave by its references to the King’s connubial affairs. Mr. Gunter, of the United States Treasury, visited the country in October to investigate the financial position. An American Military Mission visited the country at the end of the year (see paragraph 28). During the year the United States pressed for permission to create a consulate at Dhahran, but Ibn Saud would go no further than allowing them to appoint a commercial agent with no repre sentative capacity. 15. The Vichy Legation wms closed by the departure of M. Ballereau on the 19th June. The Italian and German internees left on the 14th March to be exchanged for an equal number of British in a Turkish port. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires was promoted to the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary and presented his new r credentials on 5th November. A new Iraqi Minister arrived to take over the Iraqi Legation in Jedda in March after a long interregnum during which Iraq w r as represented by a succession of charges d’affaires. The Saudi Arabian Minister at Vichy was transferred to Ankara in April. Finance. 16. The proposal to establish a Saudi Arabian Currency Board in London had not produced any definite results by the end of the year. A good deal of preparatory w T ork was done, however, principally by Mr. Peters, Accountant- General of Palestine, who visited Jedda in March and had lengthy discussions with His Majesty’s Representative and with the competent Saudi Arabian officials. Captain France, of the Minister of State’s staff, also discussed this project when he visited Jedda in July. 17. His Majesty’s Government subsidised Ibn Saud to the extent of £225,000 a month throughout the year (a total of £2,700,000), which was used for purchasing supplies from the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation and other sources. In addition to the above, the following amounts of currency were granted to Saudi Arabia by His Majesty’s Government. Riyals ... ... ... ... ... 5,000,000 Sovereigns ... ... ... ... 400,000 A further 8 million .riyals were supplied at the end of the year by the United States under Lend-Lease, and another 7 million riyals are expected to be forthcoming from the same source early in 1944. The Lend-Lease riyals which have arrived to date were minted in India and the United Kingdom from silver loaned by these countries subject to replacement from the United States. 18. The Saudi budget for 1943 showed a deficit of 30 million riyals, approximately £2,250,000 sterling, despite the subsidy, gold, and riyals given to tihe country, and despite a small pilgrimage of 30,000 persons at the end of 1942. 19. During the year the Saudi Government received an advance of 1 million dollars from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, which approximates to the amount of rental and oil subsidies accruing to the Saudi Government from the operations of the company in Saudi territory. Supplies. 20. During the year adequate supplies of foodstuffs, transport and essential commodities were sent to Saudi Arabia by the Middle East Supply Centre, which supplied practically the whole of the Saudi requirements. No acute shortage of foodstuffs w as at any time evident and the Saudi Government are most appreciative of His Majesty’s Government’s efforts in this direction. The world shortage of cotton piece-goods had its inevitable reaction on this country towards the end of the year and led to urgent demands from the King for supplies from India.5 Pilgrimage. 21. The pilgrimage was on the whole satisfactory. Some 42,000 pilgrims arrived in the country, of which approximately 37,000 came from overseas and 5,000 overland. The Saudi Government co-operated closely with His Majesty’s Legation and all transport and supply arrangements worked smoothly. The k ^financial and transport arrangements made by the office of the Minister of State Resident in the Middle East, acting in co-operation with His Majesty’s Repre sentatives in the territories concerned, were excellent and greatly contributed towards the success of the pilgrimage. 22. No Indian pilgrims made the pilgrimage, and Ibn Saud at the usual banquet given to leading personalities in Mecca during the pilgrimage stated, ,whilst regretting the absence of Indians, this absence was readily understandable and was due to war conditions and His Majesty’s Government’s solicitude for the safety of the Indian Moslems. He also made warm reference to the assistance given to the pilgrimage and to the Holy Land of Islam by His Majesty’s Government. 23. Only one unfortunate incident marked an otherwise successful pilgrimage and this was due to the religious animosity existing between the Shia and Sunni Mohammedan sects. Several fanatical Persians of the Shia sect, as a protest against Sunni domination in the Holy Places, defiled the Haram in various disgusting manners. One of these caught in the act was tried by the Ulema under Sharia law and executed. This salutary punishment has led to repercussions in Shia countries and the Persian Government recently protested to Ibn Saud and threatened to break off diplomatic relations with this country if a satisfactory explanation is not forthcoming. Miscellaneous. 24. Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. —It was decided that the value to the war effort of this company’s production of gold did not justify the utilisation of the large amount of shipping space required to provide them with materials and .to take their products back to the United States. Ibn Saud was informed of this by His Majesty’s Government in May, and was told that only sufficient space would be provided to carry materials essential for maintenance of the company’s machinery. The King quite understood the position and made no protests. At the end of the year the company was still functioning at a reduced tempo, but it is now hoped that sufficient supplies and spares will be forthcoming to permit the company to continue production. The present production is valued at about £30,000 monthly. 25. Netherlands Trading Society. —This firm, who act as bankers in Jedda, .and are indeed the only real bank in the country, have for some years only been able to carry on with the assistance of the Government of India who allowed them to obtain in India and export to Saudi Arabia gold sovereigns. At the end of the year the Government of India announced that they would be forced to stop the supply of gold. It is not yet known whether the bank will be closed or not. 26. Meteorological—l\m Saud gave permission for a party operating under the control of the Royal Air Force to establish meteorological stations at Jauf, Lina and Boreida and to teach the local officials to work them. The fullest assistance was given to the party while in Saudi Arabia and they were able to accomplish their mission in a satisfactory manner. 27. Locusts. —A greatly extended anti-locust campaign was planned and is ,being carried out in Saudi Arabia with the permission of Ibn Saud and the co-operation of the British army. In all about 1,000 men were working at the end of the year in different areas throughout the country. 28. Arms. —Ibn Saud has requested to be supplied with certain quantities of arms and ammunition for his soldiers. A great part of the year was spent in trying to ascertain how much he needed, how much he should be given and who should supply it. By the end of the year no arms had arrived, but a decision was within sight. The United States sent a military mission to Jedda in December to ascertain Saudi requirements. The mission, which was headed by General Royce, made itself unpopular with the Saudis by asking too many and irrelevant questions. The mission was not a great success, nor did the Saudis appreciate their arrival in full military uniforms. 29. Royal Family. —The King continued in good health throughout the year and kept firm control of all his vast dominions. There was some trouble amongst the tribes around Hail in May, but it appears to have been suppressed without much difficulty. Ibn Saud, of course, saw in this yet another instance of6 Hashimite intrigue. The King’s younger brother, the Amir Mohammed bin Abdurrahman, died in July. One of the younger sons, the Amir Tallal, went to Egypt for medical treatement in August, while the Amirs Mohammed and Mansur had a joyful holiday in India, during which they spent large sums of money and indulged generally in the fleshpots. The Amir Mansur also visited Palestine and Egypt in the latter part of the year. The Amir Feisal, accompanied by his brother ^ Khalid, visited the United States in October and returned via the Uniter ^ Kingdom. The Amir Saud, the Crown Prince, gave a useful indication of his attachment to His Majesty’s Government at Riyadh in September, when he caused His Majesty’s Minister to be informed that he was just as keen on the British connexion as his father, and that we could count on him when he succeeded to the throne of Saudi Arabia.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE year began well and ended well for Ibn Sand, though he is believed to have passed through a slough of despond in the middle. The Athlone visit and the discovery of oil in his territory in paying quantities gave him obvious satisfaction. The Palestine question, however, must have caused him acute anxiety as the year progressed, and then there were the perplexities aroused by the Anglo-Italian Agreement and, later, the anxiety due to the acute crisis in Europe. By November, however, the worst of the crisis was over, the Palestine outlook had improved owing to the abandonment of the partition proposal, and fresh wells began to yield oil in commercial quantities. It may be true, as one observer maintained, that during the summer Ibn Saud seemed to take little interest in public affairs, but he showed keen interest and activity in the arrange ments for the London discussions about Palestine, and it was felt that if his energies had ever been inclined to droop, they had been revived by the opportunity he now had to use his influence in the Arab world and to show his critics what he could do when he thought fit to take action. II.—Foreign Relations. (A)— General. Increasing Contact with the Outside World. 2. The penetration of Arabia proceeds apace. The country has now been crossed by an English princess—the third non-Moslem lady to accomplish this feat. American geologists have been all over Hasa, and even into the Rub-al- Khali, in their search for oil. In the summer of 1937 an English engineer had spent three months in Riyadh erecting an electric-lighting plant for Ibn Saud : for the last few months of 1938 an American driller was sinking a deep well a few miles from Riyadh in a search for water for irrigation. There are about sixty Europeans and Americans in Jedda now as against some ten or twelve a dozen years ago. The Soviet Legation closed down in September, but economic development is bringing Ibn Saud into contact with the United States and world politics into contact with Germany. Regulations affecting foreigners. 3 A, regulation governingyhe residenc£Lof Joxeigaexs in. Saudi Arabia was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 28th January, 1938, and became effective from the beginning of 1357 a.h. (the 2nd March, 1938). It requires all foreigners of more than 18 years of age who desire to reside in the Saudi Arabian Kingdom3 [18903] c* for a period of more than one year, in addition to “ the period allowed in the passport ” (a strange phrase which apparently means the period indicated in the Saudi visa on the passport), to take out a residence permit and to pay certain fees. This regulation contained nothing out of the way except a provision which undoubtedly implied that when the police issued the residence permit they would retain the holder’s national passport and would only return it to him on his leaving the country. There was another objection in that the annual fee of 10 riyals (about 16s.) is heavy for many foreigners, and in particular for the students who go to Mecca for the purpose of religious study. The Nether lands Legation made a frontal attack on the Saudi Government on these two points, but His Majesty’s Minister preferred to make personal representations. On the question of passports he wrote personally to the Amir Faisal representing the retention of foreign passports by the Jedda police as due in all probability to a misreading of the regulation, and the Saudi Government eventually found a way of retreat and all foreign passports are now returned when the registra tion formalities have been completed and the residence permits issued. As to the fee, Sir R. Bullard had a talk with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. Sheikh Yusuf promised that great consideration in the matter of the fee would be shown to poor people, and eventually a notice appeared stating that foreign students who could produce documentary evidence that they were following courses in religious instruction would be exempted from payment of the fee. Sir R. Bullard also mentioned to Sheikh Yusuf an objection which had been raised by some foreign Moslems who argued that the regulation was irreligious in that it tried to differentiate between one class of Moslem and another; but Sheikh Y usuf declared that the regulation was really necessary to enable the Government to keep track of the foreigners in the country; and, in fact, little has been heard of the argument based on religious grounds, whereas the amount of the fee continues to cause complaints, and, together with the obligation to pay koshan at the differential rate, is said to have induced many of the poorer foreigners to decide to take out Saudi papers. The Italian Legation stated that they had repatriated a considerable number of Ethiopians who had been in Saudi Arabia for as much as five years and now wished to leave in order to avoid the heavy fee for the residence permit. No attempt was made during the year to apply the regulation to the “ Takrunis,” i.e., the West Africans—possibly because it was obvious that they could never pay the high fee. 4. A “Regulation concerning the Hoisting and Use of Flags’' was promulgated on the 18th March. The principal provision is that a foreigner may only fly his national flag (1) if he is an official foreign representative, or (2) if it is the occasion of some celebration. In the second case the national flag may be flown provided the Saudi flag is flown alongside it. It was known that the Italian shipping agency had flown the Italian flag rather freely, and that the Jedda representative of the Californian Arabian Standard Oil Company had hoisted the United States flag on one occasion and had been ordered by the kaimakam to lower it, and the regulation was at first attributed to these causes; but it was learned from official sources that the object was to discourage the various Egyptian institutions in this country, which considered themselves entitled to fly the Egyptian flag, by itself, whenever they pleased. 5. On the 16th December the Umm-al-Qura published a regulation on Saudi Arabian nationality. It provides for the acquisition of Saudi Arabian nationality by foreigners of good character who have resided in this country for three years without interruption. An important provision is contained in article 12 (6), which states that a Saudi woman does not lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner unless she has been allowed to leave the Saudi Arabian Kingdom “ in accordance with the special regulation ” and has subsequently announced her acquisition of the nationality of her husband; and that she recovers her Saudi nationality on termination of Ihe marriage. This gives some legal justification to a procedure which has hitherto been unauthorised. It had been found in several cases (most of them concerning Netherlands subjects) that a foreign Moslem who married a Saudi woman found difficulty in taking her away from Saudi Arabia when he wished to return home. The authorities were inclined to refuse permission on the ground that the woman might be divorced and abandoned by her husband in a foreign country. It was pointed out to them that, under the existing Saudi law, the woman had become a foreigner by her4 marriage to a foreigner and that the Saudi authorities had no right to detain her, but no definite solution of the problem was reached. The new law regularises the position by retaining the woman as a Saudi citizen until after she has left the country. Deportation of Foreigners. 6. The attitude of the Saudi Government with regard to the deportation of undesirable foreigners is complicated by religious considerations. They consider every intending pilgrim who lands without sufficient means to pay the dues as undesirable, but they have hitherto refrained, either from religious scruples or from fear of criticism, from refusing to allow them to make the pilgrimage and deporting them at once. An attempt was made by the Kaimakam of Jedda to induce His Majesty’s Legation to repatriate fifteen persons alleged to be Indians but without papers. Having accepted the point of view of His Majesty’s Government that deportation of undesirables was the business of the Saudi authorities, the kaimakam probably adopted the ordinary local procedure and sent the undesirables southwards in a dhow and dumped them just over the Yemeni frontier. This may seem severe by our standards, but as most, if not all, such undesirables will have reached the Hejaz mainly on foot, and without complying with any passport or sanitary regulations or paying the dues, there would be little ground for objection on the part of foreign missions, even if the nationality of the persons concerned could be fully established. 7. Religious considerations have also complicated the question of stowaways on pilgrim ships. In 1937 one or two of the pilgrim ships from the Far East were found on arrival at Jedda to have stowaways on board. The authorities allowed the stowaways to make the pilgrimage, and then expected the shipping company to ship them back free. The company naturally offered to take back immediately any stowaway found on any of their ships, but not to give a free passage to a stowaway who. instead of being penalised, has actually been rewarded for his fraud by being allowed to make the pilgrimage. Impressed by this argument, the Kaimakam of Jedda this year returned the first three stowaways, but for this he seems to have been reprimanded by Ibn Saud, and the fourth stowaway who arrived was allowed to land. Soon after this the Saudi Government wished the company to give a free passage home to a Malay pilgrim who had gone mad. The company agreed on condition that the stowaway should go, too, and should not be allowed to wait to make the pilgrimage, and in the end the authorities gave in. It is hoped that this will serve as a deterrent. Difficulties peculiar to Saudi A rabia. 8. Communication between the foreign missions in Jedda and Ibn Saud during the long period when he was in or near Riyadh was facilitated to some extent by the appointment of Ibrahim-al-Mu’ammar, the Kaimakam of Jedda, as go-between. He is no more than a go-between, and he shows the keenest anxiety lest he should fail to transmit the messages to or from Ibn Saud exactly as he receives them, but at least he is intelligent, and he is very active and prompt. But even so communication is slow, partly because of the clumsy method of cyphering used, as to which the kaimakam makes no secret. The delays, which are always inconvenient, were distressing when it took some fifteen hours'to obtain the consent of Ibn Saud for British aeroplanes to search for a missing Royal Air Force bomber in Saudi territory. 9. The foreign missions are still confined to Jedda for residence. When the Afghan Minister took a house at Taif in 1936 he received a severe snub. In 1938 His Majesty’s Legation evolved a plan to establish a week-end tent sufficiently far inland for members of the staff to escape from the heat and dampness of the Red Sea coast now and then during the summer, and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate kindly offered to allow the tent to be pitched at their camp at Madraga, 90 miles up the mine road, where there is a plentiful supply of good water Unfortunately, the proposal was rejected by the Saudi Government on grounds of public security. It is difficult to judge whether this is the real reason, or whether the Saudi Government are not rather (or also) actuated by fear of foreign penetration into the interior of their territory./ 5 10. It may be well to add a few details which illustrate with particular force the difficulty of diplomatic dealings in a place where the head of the Govern ment lives normally about 800 miles away from the only town in which the British representative is allowed to live. Even in ordinary circumstances the difficulties are considerable, and when it is a question of bringing about an interview at a given moment they are greatly increased. His Majesty’s Government wished the report of the Technical Commission on Palestine and their statement of policy to be communicated to Ibn Baud twenty-four hours before publication, and for this purpose Sir R. Bullard wished to reach Riyadh before 4 p.m. G.M.T. (about 8 p.m. local time) on the 8th November. Unless the caravan was to travel at a pace which would be inhuman for the drivers, who in any case would be driving ten or more hours a day, he would need to leave on the morning of the 5th November. In point of fact most of the 5th November was spent in decyphering the statement of policy and other instructions, and a start was made only on the 6th November. In order that at least the essence of the information should reach Ibn Baud by the appointed time a very brief summary of the statement of policy was made, to be given to the Kaimakam of Jedda in good time for it to be cyphered and transmitted to Ibn Baud by wireless so as to reach him by 8 p.m. Riyadh time on the 8th November, but in spite of careful calculations and previous arrangement with the kaimakam, the message did not reach the King until about 10 a.m. on the 9th. Sir R. Bullard arrived in Riyadh at noon on the 9th. He sent to the King at once a translation of the statement of policy and of a summary of the report, which had been made on the journey, but he was not able to see the King at once as he still had to spend four hours decyphering a Foreign Office telegram which had followed him from Jedda. Ibn Baud did receive the news in advance of publication, though not the full twenty-four hours in advance. Violation of Saudi Territory. 11. The trivial complaints of trespass over the Transjordan border into Saudi territory by Transjordan troops or officials are mentioned in the section on Transjordan. There were also several protests against alleged violation of Saudi territory by aeroplanes at various places near the Transjordan frontier, but on no occasion could the authorities in Transjordan find that the complaint was well founded, not even when the Minister for Foreign Affairs told a circum stantial tale of Saudi flocks being scared at night by an aeroplane which turned a searchlight on them. Sometimes there was no record of an aeroplane being in the neighbourhood in question within a day or two of the date specified, and on the one occasion when the Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to have specified place and date reasonably exactly, it was denied that the aeroplane ever crossed the border. 12. In March a note was received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs saying that after sunset on the 22nd February a large warship anchored “ in the waters of Jabal Katan south of Qahma opposite Khisa ” (close to 18° north latitude); the local authorities thought that the vessel was perhaps British, and, if she was, the Saudi Government must express their disapproval at her coming “ without previous permission as usual,” and must protest against the violation of their sovereignty. The same note said that before sunset on the 26th February two aircraft had flown over Qahma Mountain towards the sea. His Majesty’s Minister was told by the Saudi authorities that a similar note had been addressed to the Italian Legation, though in that case it was suggested that the aeroplanes were Italian, not the warship. Sir R. Bullard was able to inform the Saudi Government in due course that no British warship was in those waters, and no British aircraft in that area, on the dates named. Later on, he learned privately that the Saudi authorities believed both ship and aeroplanes to have been Italian. 13. Further consideration had to be given to the question of the islands of Tiran and Senafir, at the mouth of the Gulf of Akaba. The conclusion had been reached in 1936 (paragraph 189 of the report for that year) that Saudi Arabia alone had a good claim to them, and that it would be unwise to raise the question. What the attitude of the Saudi Government might be was unknown at the time, but in May 1938, when the commanding officer of H.M.S. Fleetwood was paying a call on the Kaimakam of Jedda and referred to Tiran and Senafir in connexion with his approaching voyage to Akaba, the kaimakam said that these islands were of course part of the Saudi Arabian Kingdom. A vague reply was returned [18903] ' c* 2bv a member of the legation stall who was present, and the kaimakam did not pursue the subject or show T any suspicion, but His Majesty s Minister thought it well to report the incident to the Foreign Oihce. I he standing instructions from the Admiralty at that time were that escort vessels in the Red Sea should pay occasional visits to these islands, which for this purpose should be treated as of indeterminate ownership, no notification of an intended visit being given either to the Egyptian or to the Saudi authorities. Captain Dowding had intended to have a look at the two islands on his way to Akaba, but he agreed with His Majesty’s Minister that it would be better to abandon the intention in order to allow time for the matter to be reconsidered in the light of the kaimakam’s statement, which coincided with the Foreign Office view of the legal position, and of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. In his report to the Foreign Office, Sir R. Bullard suggested that it might be possible to detect any unusual activity on these islands from aircraft flying outside their territorial waters and that we should be content with that form of observation and His Majesty’s ships should not land anyone on either of the islands. In transmitting this suggestion to the Admiralty the Foreign Office said that they felt that the Saudi Government might take steps to occupy the islands, and on the whole they saw no grave disadvantage in that, unless it should cause serious difficulties with other Powers, and that now seemed unlikely. They pointed out that the Middle Eastern Agree ment with Italy, if it should come into force, might alter the existing situation to some extent, since to whomever the islands might belong, the agreement gave a w r arning to all Pow r ers other than Saudi Arabia not to attempt to occupy them. In the end it was agreed that visits of His Majesty’s ships to the islands should be discontinued, but observation should continue to be kept by aircraft as had been done hitherto. That was the state of affairs in October, when, on account of information received by the Palestine authorities about the running of arms from Egypt to Akaba, H.M.S. Weston was instructed to watch the Gulf of Akaba. The commanding officer made a hurried call at Jedda in order to explain to His Majesty’s Minister that the efficacy of his task depended largely on his being allowed to anchor occasionally in territorial waters off Tiran or Senafir, which commanded the entrance to the Gulf of Akaba. Sir R. Bullard recom mended to the Foreign Office that the request should be granted, the commanding officer undertaking to use the privilege as sparingly as possible. He felt that if the presence of the ship attracted the attention of the Saudi authorities, which was not certain, we could plead the indeterminate status of the islands and the fact that in the past His Majesty’s ships had anchored there frequently and even landed on the islands, which are completely deserted. On the 18th October the escort vessels in the Red Sea received instructions from the Admiralty relaxing the orders about Tiran and Senafir for the purpose of the special arms patrol and permitting them to visit and anchor in the territorial waters of those islands. The instructions pointed out the importance of not reopening the question of sovereignty, and said that the islands should not be visited more than was necessary for operational reasons, and that no observation posts or ships’ boats should be left. It is assumed that these orders were acted upon, but if they were they would seem to have attracted no attention from the Saudi authorities. 14. In December the legation received a note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs alleging that four aeroplanes believed to be British had been seen going north over Saudi territory in the neighbourhood of Qatif in Hasa. This information was sent to His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad, but there had been no time for a reply to be received by the end of the year. 15. The claim laid by the Saudi Government to an island, called by them Libaina, on which the Government of Bahrein had erected a mark, is dealt with in paragraph 105. Foreign Propaganda. 16. Ibn Sand is probably quite sincere when he says that he objects to the use of the Moslem Holy Land as a basis for foreign propaganda, though his objection may be political rather than religious. There is some evidence that quantities of the anti-British propaganda about Palestine (including a consign ment of gramophone records) which was sent down from Syria for distribution during the pilgrimage were seized and detained, though a good deal of it was in fact distributed both in Mecca and in Jedda. One result of the extravagant7 Italian propaganda of 1937 (paragraph 147 of that year) was the promulgation of a measure which though general in terms was in fact intended to circumscribe the efforts of the Italian Legation to spread its propaganda in the Hejaz. It was in the form of a circular from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the foreign missions, saying that certain missions had been observed to be carrying out “official formalities” with departments other than the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and asking that the official channel provided by the Ministry should be exclusively used in future. At the same time orders were issued to Saudi officials and even to private Saudi citizens, not to mix with members of foreign missions except on official occasions, and steps were taken to prevent the use of the telephone for purposes of propaganda. It was feared at first that Saudi officials might take advantage of this regulation to obstruct the pilgrimage work of the legation but Fuad Bey gave assurances that this was not to be feared, and, in fact, the Indian Vice-Consul has had little trouble on that score. The Soviet Legation complained at first that the regulation had cut them off from their Arab acquaintances, but some relaxation of the restriction in this respect was noticed later in the year. The ban on propaganda suits His Majesty’s Govern ment very well, and when the question arose towards the end of the year, whether copies of a weekly magazine published in Egypt under British auspices would be useful in the He.jaz, His Majesty’s Minister gave it as his opinion that we had better refrain completely from propaganda in this country. It appears to Sir R. Bullard that, apart from the King’s objection to propaganda, we might provoke the Italians to a competition in which our greater vulnerability and their greater powers of invention and vituperation would put us at a disadvantage. Pan-Arabism and Pan-Islamism. 17. In spite of the interest which the various parts of the Arab world take in each other’s fate, and of the common attitude adopted towards the Palestine question, there are few signs of a development of a pan-Arab policy, or even ot a strong pan-Arab spirit. Indeed, the Palestine question itself tended to illustrate the cleavage, for it was evident that Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iraq each wanted to get most of the credit for any settlement which might be arrived at. Ibn Saud is suspicious of Iraq and Egypt, as stronger neighbours who ma} wish to exercise undue influence over his affairs, and his suspicions were not diminished by the shouts of triumph with which Taufiq Suaidi returned from his conversations in London about the Palestine question, or by the talk about the establishment of an Egyptian Caliphate. He still detests and distrusts the Amir Abdullah, and in spite of the correspondence which he keeps up with ban a, he regards the Imam as a silly old man, his eldest son as a tool of the Italians, and his people as savages. As to the population of Saudi Arabia, apart from the ordinary hostility of townsman and nomad, no love is lost between the Hejaz ^ n d Nejd. The Hejazi regards the Nejdis as locusts, and considers them, as he does the Syrians, as foreigners, while the Syrians who are prominent in Saudi foreign affairs and what is called for convenience the public health service strive to maintain their monopoly against all comers and, in particular, against the Egyptians. th States in Arabia. Iraq. 18. The Iraq Government seem to regard Ibn Saud with condescension and he certainly regards them with caution, if not suspicion, but relations weie outwardly very cordial throughout the year, and in September the growing importance of the relations of the two countries was marked by the replacement of the Saudi Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad by a Minister. The first to enjoy this enhanced status was Hamza-al-Gauth, a native of Medina long employed m Ibn Sand’s diwan. It had been agreed in principle that Iraq was to have a Minister at Riyadh, but no appointment had been made by the time the year came to an end. The rather bombastic attempts of Taufiq Suaidi to claim the credit for bringing about a change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to Palestine were highly displeasing to Ibn Saud, who, however, can hardly have been better pleased when Taufiq Suaidi was succeeded as Foreign Minister by Nuri Pasha. Ibn Saud is particularly suspicious of Nuri, whom he suspects of advocating policies which are to his own advantage rather than to the advantage of the Arabs in general. [18903] D *8 19. In January the Iraq Government sent to Jedda a new Charge d’Affaires, Thabit Abdul Nur, and through him they put forward proposals for the con clusion of three agreements : (1) a currency agreement; (2) a three-cornered barter arrangement with Japan; and (3) a military agreement. Thabit Bey, who is a convert from, Christianity, is a bustling pan-Arab with an exaggerated conception of the “ progress ” which Iraq has made and a contempt for the backwardness of the Hejaz, and he may have tried to carry things with too high a hand. In any case, Ibn Saud was unwilling to be rushed, and he asked for the confidential advice of His Majesty’s Government, through Sir R. Bullard, on all of the pro posed arrangements. It seemed likely at first that Thabit Bey had put forward some if not all of these proposals on his own responsibility, in view of his character, the nature of some of the proposals, and the fact that the Iraq Government had not mentioned any such projects to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, as they might have been expected to do under the first article of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930; but this theory was disposed of when the Iraq Legation’s letters were shown to Sir R. Bullard, and when, on being asked by His Majesty’s Ambassador how Thabit Bey was getting on in Jedda, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the currency and barter proposals and gave some details about them. 20. The essence of the currency proposal was that Iraq and Saudi Arabia should have a common currency : either Iraqi notes with special distinguishing marks should be introduced into Saudi Arabia, or else new notes should be issued for circulation in both countries. The agreement would be for nine years; the profits of the Saudi Government were fixed at 60,000 dinars a year for the first three years and at 100,000 dinars for the last six years, and the Saudi Govern ment were “ requested to take their profits for the first six years beforehand, as an advance.” In spite of the offer of an advance of £480,000, the Saudi Government viewed the proposal with hesitation. They asked His Majesty’s Government whether the scheme in general was to the Saudi Government’s advantage, and, if so, whether the suggested profit was fair; and whether Saudi Arabia would not be to some extent in the power of the Iraq Government in view of the fact that the scheme would be under the control of the Iraq Currency Board in London, on which the Saudi Government would have only one representative. They took the opportunity to ask whether it would be possible for the Saudi Government to establish a note currency on the same lines as that of Iraq, “ on the understanding that the Board should hold certain amounts of gold and that, as to the rest, the cover should consist of company securities and not bonds of State loans, in order that usury might be avoided.” 21. After careful consideration by His Majesty’s Government, a reply to the following effect was returned to the Saudi Government’s enquiry :—• (1) The scheme could only be regarded as desirable and in the financial interests of Saudi Arabia if (a) notes or token coins were fully covered by sterling securities, whether guaranteed by Iraq or by His Majesty’s Government themselves, and (b) if notes or token coin would be readily accepted by nationals of Saudi Arabia to an adequate extent. (2) The calculation of the fair share of Saudi Arabia in the net profit of a note issue would depend on the amount of notes likely to circulate in Iraq and Saudi Arabia respectively, and of that it was difficult to form an estimate. (3) The scheme would certainly involve danger if a dispute occurred between Iiaq and Saudi Arabia, or if on their part Iraq made new currency arrangements different from those then in force. On the other hand, the establishment of an independent currency board for Saudi Arabia seemed unlikely to be feasible. The notes would have to be fully covered m sterling securities readily marketable in London, such as British Government securities and notes or else token coins of a lower intrinsic value than the present Saudi nyals would have to be acceptable to the population; but a final opinion on tnai point could only be given after local enquiry by an expert. 22. On receipt of this reply the Saudi Government expressed their gratitude for the opinion, which they said coincided with their own.[18903] D* 2 9 23. The barter arrangement, though drafted in general terms, was a device by which the Iraq Government hoped to induce Japan to make larger purchases from Iraq at the cost of a commission to the Saudi Arabian Government. In spite of the adoption of a quota system, Iraq has an unfavourable trade balance with ^ Japan. Saudi Arabia buys much from Japan, but sells nothing in return, but inasmuch as her revenue does not depend upon selling exports but upon pilgrim dues and to a small though rapidly growing extent on royalties from oil, she is free, provided she can afford it, to buy wherever she pleases. The essence of the Iraq proposal was that Saudi Arabia should compel Japan, under threat of taking her custom elsewhere, to undertake to spend in Saudi Arabia, or in default of suitable goods in Saudi Arabia, in Iraq, a fixed percentage of the total price paid for Japanese exports to Saudi Arabia, and that the Iraq Government should pay to Saudi Arabia a commission of 10 or 15 per cent, on the value of Iraqi goods exported to Japan as a result of this arrangement. His Majesty’s Govern ment considered the scheme carefully and in the end a rather discouraging reply was sent, pointing out that it would be difficult to establish whether increased exports to the third country had or had not resulted from the arrangement and that, consequently, it would be necessary to keep an elaborate system of trade statistics; that the negotiation of the agreement would be very difficult, especially if the third party felt that it could afford to dispense with the market which it had hitherto found for its goods in Iraq or Saudi Arabia; and that such barter agreements usually prove to be not only difficult to negotiate but a fruitful source of difference of opinion among the parties throughout the whole period of the agreement. If these difficulties could be surmounted, the reply concluded, the scheme might possibly be to the advantage of the Saudi Government, but before an opinion could be given it would be necessary to study the draft text of the proposals. 24. The Iraq Government met with better fortune when they suggested the conclusion of a military agreement. This was mainly because they could invoke article 7 of the treaty of 1936. They suggested that postponement would be dangerous in view of the insecurity of the international situation. I hey proposed in particular the co-ordination of training, arms and medical services, and fore shadowed the eventual inclusion of the Yemen in the agreement. As His Majesty’s Government had been unable to assist Ibn Saud with his military and air programmes to any great extent, and as the treaty of 1936 gave the Iraq proposals a legal basis, His Majesty’s Government replied that, while the matter was primarily one for settlement between the signatories of the treaty of 1936, they saw no harm in the Saudi Government’s agreeing to discuss any detailed proposals which the Iraq Government might put forward for the co-ordination of the military systems of the two countries in accordance with article 7 of the treaty. 25. Early in the year Sheikh Yusuf Yasin visited Iraq to negotiate some of the other agreements subsidiary to the 1936 treaty. Three of these were signed on the 19th May; they dealt with (1) the Neutral Zone; (2) grazing rights; and (3) nationality of the border tribes. The object of the first seems to have been mainly to ensure the peaceful settlement of inter-tribal disputes. The second provides that the tribes of each of the two States may cross freely into the territory of the other for grazing and shall be exempt from customs dues on their animals on such occasions. Taxes are to be collected from visiting tribes by the local officials and subsequently transmitted to the authorities of the country to which the tribes belong. The third agreement provides that members of the tribes named in the agreement shall be deemed to have become nationals of the country in which they have resided for the last three years, unless they move into the other country within six months of the coming into force of the new agreement. 26. Hopes referred to in the press, of the conclusion of subsidiary agree ments to ensure the removal of passport and customs restrictions between the two countries, were not fulfilled. 27. By a letter from the Iraq Minister for Foreign Affairs dated the 7th February and a reply from the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs dated the 8th March, it was agreed that the Arbitration Protocol annexed to the Saudi- Iraqi Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” of the 7th April, 1931, should remain in force until the protocol foreshadowed in article 2 of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance of 1936 should come into force.10 28. By a similar exchange of letters it was agreed that a joint survey of the common frontier should be carried out with reference to Protocol No. 1 of Uqair, of 1922. This correspondence was notable for two points. One was the insertion in the Saudi reply of the condition which was attached to the Saudi acceptance of His Majesty’s Government’s proposal for a joint survey of the Transjordan frontier, viz., that the information and maps resulting from the survey should be for the purpose of negotiation regarding the line the frontier should take. The other was the inclusion in the Iraqi proposals of the words : “If the Saudi Government have no surveyors to co-operate in this work with the Iraqi surveyors, then the latter can do it by themselves, provided the Saudi Arabian Government bear half the cost.” It is not surprising that the Saudi reply ignored this con descending offer and merely agreed to “ the appointment on their behalf of a party to co-operate with the Iraq party in a series of trigonometrical surveys. ...” The Saudi Government had, in fact, obtained the loan of an American surveyor from C.A.S.O.C. The beginning of the work was delayed for some time owing to the lateness of the Saudi survey party in arriving on the ground, while the great heat necessitated the suspension of the work for over four months in the summer. The Saudi plan is to begin the joint survey of the Transjordan frontier when that of the Iraq frontier has been completed. 29. Official British reports from Iraq and Koweit suggest that the prestige of Ibn Saud on and beyond the Iraq frontier is increasing. A dispute between the I bn Hadhal and Ibn Mi j lad sections of the Amarat (a division of the Anaiza) which occurred on the Iraq frontier seems to have been settled by Ibn Musa’id, the Amir of Hail, without any help from the Iraqi official who had been sent down to deal with it. Some of the Sa’duns were reported to be in touch with Ibn Musa’id, and some sections of the Huchaim who went further than usual into Saudi Arabia were cordially received and returned untaxed and with presents of rifles and ammunition. Ihe name of Ibn Saud was in high repute among the Euphrates tribes who are opposed to the Iraq Government, and allegations have even been made that Ibn Musa’id, or some other person, has been running arms from Saudi Arabia into the Euphrates country. 30. Ibn Saud spoke to His Majesty’s Minister with some indignation about the designs of the Iraq Government on Koweit. This may have been one of the considerations which made him anxious to conclude the trade agreement with Koweit to which he had hitherto been indifferent if not hostile. It will not have pleased him to learn that the malcontents who caused trouble in Bahrein in the autumn included in their demands that where foreign officials could not be replaced by local men Iraqis should be engaged. Palestine. 31. Of the vast number of Palestine papers for 1938 the first which needs recording is a report of negotiations by Shakib Arslan in Syria for the holdiny P f awte ab I Junng the Pilgrimage to discuss the question of 1 alestme. His Majesty s Minister reported that Ibn Saud would not consent tc such a proposal, and in fact nothing came of it. consent tc 32. On the 4th January Sir R. Bullard had an audience with the Kinu who was m camp at Muhchtha and handed to him the text of the statement whifh was to the new Technh.ai O g P 0 ^ of His Majesty’s Government in regard to tne new lechmeal Commission, which was to find out facts concprnlnJthp partition scheme and work out details as to finance, boundaries, &amp;c The Kim? appeared to be grateful to have been informed in advance.

The visit of Nuri Pasha’s representative to Ibn Sand must have coin cided with this interview, though the King said nothing on the subject. The representative was Muwaffaq Bey-ai-Allousy, formerly Iraq Consul at Beirut. Nuri Pasha subsequently explained that A1 Allousy had been sent to dispel Ibn Baud’s apprehensions concerning tendentious reports that Nuri was to negotiate a settlement on the basis of a confederation of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq with Jewish immigration into all these territories. But A1 Allousy evidently discussed Nuri’s own proposals as well, since Fuad Hamza asked His Majesty’s Minister later on what he thought of them. 34. The King again spoke his mind on Palestine to Sir R. Bullard at Shumaisi on the 13th January, on the occasion of the visit of Lord Belhaven. He made the following points : partition might be imposed for a time by force, but sooner or later the Arabs would rise against it; he had informed the restive ulema of Nejd that he would never help those who attacked His Majesty’s Government; the enmity of the Arabs to the Jews was based on considerations of honour, of religion, and even existence. Finally, the King said that he regarded himself as a “ member of the British Cabinet,” and was shortly sending a memorandum to them setting forth his views from the point of view of his friendship for them. 35. The memorandum reached the legation on the 17th January. It was very lengthy and diffuse. Ibn Saud began by reaffirming his friendship for Great Britain, but said that he saw the breach between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab world becoming wider as the result of the policy of repression. He did not venture to give detailed advice, but he suggested three things : (1) Jewish immigration to be stopped until a solution could be reached, or at any rate for two years; (2) sales of land to cease during the same period; and (3) a political amnesty to be granted to improve the atmosphere and encourage a feeling of co-operation. In conclusion the King offered to draw up detailed plans after ascertaining the opinion of reliable persons. 36. A sidelight on the feelings of some of Ibn Saud’s subjects about Palestine was afforded by a report from the Russian instructor to the air force, who told the Minister that the firebrand Nationalist who is in charge of the air force in Jedda, Sa’id A1 Kurdi, longed to take his aeroplanes for a flight along the Transjordan frontier, in order that the tribes could see that the Saudis had an air force. The result, according to Kurdi, would be that the Transjordan tribes would rise and join their oppressed brethren in Palestine; the Saudi tribes would then join too, and Ibn Saud would be forced to allow the movement to go on, or even to encourage it. 37. There was no doubt that the Palestine question was gradually forcing the King into a position in which he could not be as helpful as he would like to be to His Majesty’s Government and Sir R. Bullard felt bound to utter a warning. Unless, he said, the situation soon turned more to the advantage of the Arabs, it could not be guaranteed that Ibn Saud would not become less and less friendly. 38. Nuri Pasha’s views, as expressed at the Foreign Office on the 17th January, were that the Arabs were getting quite out of control; they really feared Jewish domination. Restriction of the immigration of Jews, in such a way that they would remain a minority, coupled with the continuance of the mandate, was his solution. We have no evidence that he mentioned to Ibn Saud his other scheme for the formation of a sort of commonwealth of Arab nations, under a single King, and there is little chance that Ibn Saud would have accepted such a dubious proposal. 39. Pilgrimage day, which fell on the 10th February, passed without any untoward manifestations about Palestine, though vast quantities of propaganda literature had found their way into the country. The greater part of this volume of paper was, according to Fuad Hamza, confiscated and destroyed by order of the King : but specimens must have got into many hands, and the floor of a hotel close to the Minister’s residence was littered with such pamphlets. 40. It is believed that a consignment of gramophone records bearing anti- British propaganda about Palestine were confiscated by the authorities, but in December two such records came to the notice of the legation, when they were found to be of Syrian manufacture. It will be remembered that gramophones are still officially prohibited in Saudi Arabia.12 41. The Saudi apprehensions about Nuri Pasha's activities were shown by a visit paid by the Saudi Minister to Mr. liendel at the Foreign Ollice on the 4th February. Mr. Rendel was able to assure Sheikh Hafiz that Nuri 1 asha was in no privileged position with regard to Palestine, and that there was no question of His Majesty’s Government coming to any arrangement with any Arab ruler about Palestine behind Ibn Saud’s back. 42. The next move was a message sent by the Imam of the Yemen to Ibn Saud during the course of the Italian conversations, about the 13th March. The Imam, telegraphing en clair, said that he had asked the British and the Italian Governments to bring about a satisfactory settlement of the Palestine question, and urged that Ibn Sand should do the same, and should try to persuade the I raq Government to take similar action. The King told His Majesty s Minister that this move was the result of Italian influence, and that, although he cared nothing for Italy, the Yemen, or Iraq, he would like to have the advice of His Majesty s Government as to a suitable answer. He did not want the Yemen or Iraq to usurp a more prominent position in the Moslem world at his expense. On the 17th March the Iraq Charge d’Affaires proposed to the King that the two countries should make a joint appeal to His Majesty’s Government about Palestine. Various discussions took place between His Majesty's Minister and Yusuf Yasin as to the terms of the replies which the King might like to make to these embarrassing appeals. With the authority of the Foreign Office the Minister addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs suitable replies on tbe point raised, including a statement that there could be no development in regard to Palestine till the Technical Commission presented its report, a refusal to admit Italian intervention, and an expression of their opinion that joint representations would serve no useful purpose. The King sent his thanks for these views, as well as for advance information concerning immigration into Palestine for the six months beginning the 1st April. 43. It is worth mentioning here that at an interview which a Palestine official had with Dr. Shahbandar, the Syrian politician, in Cairo at the end of February, the doctor stated that Ibn Saud had given his support to Nuri Pasha's scheme for a Commonwealth of Arab nations, on the understanding that he would be the suzerain of the federation. Each would have its own form of Government, and the first step was to join Iraq with Syria, and then to bring in Palestine, Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. It seems unlikely that Ibn Saud ever promised definite support to so unpractical a scheme. 44. In spite of previous declarations to the contrary, the Iraqi Government handed in a memorandum on Palestine on the 20th April, and Ibn Saud, with evident reluctance, followed suit. The Saudi communication, which was marked “ Secret,” objected to partition, which, it argued, would not settle the Jewish problem since Palestine could not absorb the Jews scattered about the world; pleaded for clemency; and ended by explaining that the King’s silence exposed him to embarrassing criticism. • When the text of the Iraqi memorandum (which was also not for publication) was examined, it became evident that Ibn Saud had cut down the Iraqi draft considerably. About a month later (on the 14th May) the King said that the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires was urging him to consent to the publication of the two notes. His Majesty’s Minister discouraged this idea and the King took the same line. As for the Yemen, the Imam made his declaration in the form of a telegram, also dated the 20th April, appealing for clemency and suggesting that decisions (such as the establishment of the Jews in Palestine) often turn out to be wrong when tested by experience. The Foreign Office replied by telegram on the 19th May. 45. An alleged attempt at gun-running from Jauf in the Wady Sirhan, first reported at the end of April, gave rise to a great deal of correspondence. The King, while admitting that one of the suspected gun-runners, Muhammad Ali Darwaza, had come to Qarayat, asserted that he had been expelled, and renewed his assurances of friendship. Subsequent reports, however, supplied evidence that some gun-running had, at any rate, been attempted. Seven cars were reported to have reached Sikaka, east of Jauf, from Hail early in April, under a strong guard. The activities of a notorious gun-running sheikh named Mijhim Shaalan had been watched and appeared very suspicious. News of a consignment of arms from Germany, sent via Turkey and addressed to Ibn Saud, but really13 [18903] d* 4 intended for the Palestine insurgents, came to hand at about this time, and it appeared possible, all things considered, that Ibn Saud had after all found it prudent to give some such help to the Arabs in Palestine. The Minister set out, in a lengthy despatch, the series of events which might, with some reason, have S* caused the King to support our enemies. Nevertheless, when His Majesty’s Minister brought these reports of gun-running through his territory to the King’s notice, saying that out of friendship for him His Majesty’s Government felt compelled to pass them on in case the “ persons of ulterior motives ” (to whom the King had elsewhere alluded) were seeking to discredit him, he denied the accusations most vehemently and gave assurances that he was not interfering. A fortnight later he followed this up by a very long note, which can be summarised as follows. He drew a parallel between the present allegations and those made against the British at the time of the Dawish and the Rifada revolts. In spite of appeals he had refused to help the insurgents with money or arms, not because he did not hate our Palestine policy, but because he considered armed resistance futile. He intended to adhere to his policy of friendship with Great Britain. The Palestine question had caused violent agitation among his people, who, but for him, would have taken action wldch would have increased the gravity of the situation. It was true that one or two suspicious characters had been in the north of his country recently, but he had had one of them deported and some cartridges which he had bought confiscated. He ended with the usual expressions of confidence in the British sense of justice. In spite of the King’s vehemence, it was considered possible that he might be actively pondering in his mind the advantages of transferring his affections to those who might well offer a good deal more in the way of material assistance than we can, and who are not saddled by a policy which outrages the religious and political feelings of the Arabs. A change in the Saudi attitude to the Italians, and even flirtations with the Germans, were not thought impossible. 46. Early in August a note was addressed to the Saudi Arabian Government setting forth His Majesty's Government’s attitude to the two memoranda of January and April, in which the King had explained his own views on Palestine. His Majesty’s Government still considered partition offered the best chance of a solution, and were awaiting the report of the Technical Commission, on the receipt of which fresh decisions would have to be taken and submitted to Parlia ment and the League of Nations. As for any relaxation of the measures for repressing terrorism, that could not be contemplated so long as the opposition in Palestine pursued such methods. Suspension of land sales and immigration would be contrary to the terms of the mandate. The partition proposals involved no danger to the sacred places of Islam. The advantages of partition to the Arabs were repeated. 47. In July the Saudi Minister in London evinced a certain interest in unofficial proposals said to have emanated from private persons in Iraq, and suggested that His Majesty’s Government, even though they could not support any of these schemes, might nevertheless be glad if such private persons could find a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews. It was made clear to him that even if this were the case, there was no question of any of these proposals receiving official support. 48. The next definite move of the pan-Arab party was the organisation of a Parliamentary Arab Conference at Cairo. The organisers said that they had received King Ibn Saud’s written approval of the proposal. There was no doubt that he was subjected to great pressure from the ulema and other advisers, with the object of inducing him to send Saudi representatives. He asked the advice of His Majesty’s Government on this point, and on the receipt of a discouraging reply he informed the legation that he had decided not to send anyone. 49. The European crisis of September 1938 had a repercussion on Palestine which must be mentioned here, though the happy issue of that crisis removed tin- necessity for the proposed action. The Colonial Office proposed, in the event of war, to abandon for the duration of hostilities the proposal to partition Palestine, and also to suspend Jewish immigration : His Majesty’s Government would administer the country as far as possible in accordance with the terms of the mandate. The legation reported that such a policy would be very acceptable to the Arabs of Saudi Arabia, and more especially to Ibn Saud.14 50. The Amir Saud, who went to England in the summer for dental treat ment, was received by the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs and also by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and explained his father s views to them At that time, however, His Majesty’s Government were awaiting the report of the Technical Commission on Palestine, and it was not possible to give a delimte reply ^ to His Royal Highness. 51. The report of the Technical Commission on Palestine reached Jedda on the 26th October. The commission recommended by a majority a modified form of partition, which they called economic federalism. It seemed to them that although the scheme would withhold fiscal autonomy from the Jewish and Arab States, it would, subject to certain reservations, form a satisfactory basis for settlement, provided that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept the very considerable financial liability involved. 52. His Majesty’s Government decided to issue the report and a statement of policy at 4 p.m. G.M.T. on the 9th November, and they authorised His Majesty’s Minister to communicate these two documents to Ibn Saud twenty-four hours in advance. Sir R. Bullard was also authorised to ask Ibn Saud whether he would receive him at Riyadh for the purpose, or would prefer to have the information sent to him by post and telegraph. The King gave Sir R. Bullard a cordial invitation to Riyadh. 53. The statement of policy began by recapitulating the attitude which His Majesty’s Government had adopted towards the Peel Report and giving a brief summary of the findings of the Technical Commission. It then announced that His Majesty’s Government had reached the conclusion that the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine were so great that the solu tion of the problem by partitioning the country was impracticable. His Majesty’s Government would therefore continue their responsibility for the government of the whole of Palestine. They believed, however, that an alternative means of discharging their obligations to the Arabs and the Jews could be found. It was clear to them that the surest foundation for peace and progress in Palestine would be an understanding between Arabs and Jews, and they were resolved to make a determined effort to promote such an understanding. 'With that end in view they proposed to issue an invitation immediately to representatives of the Palestine Arabs and of neighbouring States on the one hand, and of the Jewish Agency on the other, to confer with them as soon as possible in London regarding future policy. As to the representatives of the Palestine Arabs, His Majesty’s Government must reserve the right to refuse to receive those leaders whom they might regard as responsible for the campaign of assassination and violence. They hoped that the discussions in London might help to promote agreement as to the future policy regarding Palestine. They, however, regarded it as important that an early decision should be reached, and if the London discussions should not produce an agreement within a reasonable period they would take their own decision in the light of their examination of the problem and of the discussions in London. In considering and settling their policy they would keep in mind the international character of the mandate and their obligations in that respect. 54. The provisional draft of this statement of policy had been in the hands of His Majesty s representatives at Jedda, Cairo and Bagdad for some days before the date of publication, and His Majesty’s Government sent them their observations on the comments which had been received from those posts, in order that they might themselves understand the policy of His Majesty’s Government and defend it actively in discussions with the Governments to which they were accredited. These observations were as follows :— J (1) Acceptance by the Saudi Government or any other Government to the London discussions would, of course, be without prejudice to their views regarding the Balfour Declaration or regarding anv other aspect of the Palestine problem. * n 7 G (2) The Jewish Agency would be invited to send representatives as obviously the appropriate organisation under article 15 of the mandate for the representation of Jewish interests in Palestine. TheAgency is composed half of Zionists and half of non-Zionists, and undoubtedly non-Zionists would be included among the Jewish repre sentatives for the discussions in London. (3) Immigration could not be stopped pending the negotiations^ because it would prejudice one of the main issues. His Majesty’s Government had in July 1937 departed from the criterion of economic abortive capacity, and had imposed as a temporary measure an arbitrary restriction which allowed Jewish immigration at the average rate of about 1,000 a month. In their opinion the only wise course was to maintain the present restriction under which Jewish immigration was not likely to exceed 12,000 a year. As the natural increase of the Arabs in Palestine exceeded that of the Jews by at least 15,000 a year, immigration at that rate as a temporary measure afforded no ground for Arab fears. (4) His Majesty’s Government wished the discussions to begin as early as possible. If this could be arranged and representatives of the Arabs could be ready by the beginning of December, so much the better. (5) The question whether or not to accept the Mufti as the head of the Palestine Arab delegation had been fully considered. His Majesty’s Government recognised that there was much to be said for negotiating with a generally recognised leader who was unlikely to be repudiated subsequently, and feeling on the subject in Iraq and Egypt must also be taken into account. Ibn Baud, however, might well dislike the idea of the Mufti posing as the head of the Arab delegation, and this view would be shared by the Amir Abdullah. But His Majesty’s Government had stronger reasons for refusing to receive the Mufti; he was regarded as chiefly responsible for the campaign of assassina tion and intimidation, and it would be extremely unfortunate if His Majesty's Government could be represented as having surrendered to that campaign. There was another point (though care would have to be taken in using it) • if the Mufti were once recognised as the Arab leader he would be recognised as the ruler of the country and none of the moderate Arabs would dare to come forward. The precedents of Egypt, Ireland and South Africa did not really apply, for in the present case of Palestine His Majesty’s Government could not con template entrusting to the Mufti and his associates the government of the country after the negotiations. These arguments, however, did not apply to all the Mufti’s sympathisers, and it had always been the intention of His Majesty’s Government to endeavour to secure as representatives of the Palestine Arabs individuals who held equally strong nationalist views, but had not been directly responsible for the campaign of assassination, &amp;c. His Majesty’s Government were even consulting the High Commissioner for Palestine as to the possibility of admitting as negotiators some of the Mufti’s more immediate associates, e.q., some of the expelled members of the old Arab Higher Committee, provided that they came as representatives of the Palestine Arabs and not as representing the Mufti. (6) The question of military measures in Palestine before and during the conference was under consideration. It might be possible to relax some of the more repressive acts against unarmed civilians, and thereby perhaps relieve the tension. But there was no intention to negotiate a truce with the rebel leaders; such truces had proved only temporary in the past. On this occasion everything possible must be done in the military as well as the political sphere to ensure that an organised and extensive terrorist campaign could not break out again. His Majesty’s Government must do their utmost to restore order and normal conditions and to re-establish the administration throughout Palestine. (7) (This point was for the personal information of His Majesty’s represen tatives only.) A complete stoppage of immigration pending negotiations would almost certainly stand no chance of acceptance by Parliament. Moreover, it was doubtful whether the Jews would participate in that case, in view of the inequitable and impossible position in which they would thereby be placed. [18903] E*16 55. When the statement of policy, reinforced by the arguments in the preceding paragraph, was communicated to Ibn Saud at itiyadh by His Majesty’s Minister, he received it with relief and satisfaction. The abandonment of the partition proposal was very welcome to him, though from the beginning he had seemed unable to believe that His Majesty’s Government could in the last resort find partition to be either just or practicable. He accepted in principle the invitation to send representatives to the London discussions. He did not question the decision of His Majesty’s Government to exclude the organisers of terrorism, and referred to the Mufti with amused condescension. He proposed to make soundings in Palestine about the selection of suitable representatives of the Arabs there. On the whole, it seemed to Sir R. Bullard rather more optimistic than the difficulty of the problem warranted. 56. The following day Ibn Saud asked whether His Majesty’s Government would welcome mediation by any or all of the Arab rulers with a view to the suspension of hostilities, but said that it would be useless unless accompanied by some concession, such as an amnesty or the release of prisoners. Sir R. Bullard held out no hope of such concessions, but transmitted the suggestion to London. His Majesty s Government thanked the King, but enquired cautiously what exactly was meant by suspension of hostilities”; they assumed that His Majesty did not mean the postponement of operations which were just then restoring the authority of the Government in certain areas, e.g., Beersheba. By the time this message arrived, however, Ibn Saud was more concerned with the possibility that he might be isolated, and he preferred to discuss the question of co-operation with other Arab States. o7. I he K ing suggested that the best way to avoid delay, to ensure co-operation, and to utilise his influence was that the London representatives of feaudi Arabia, Iraq and Egypt should enter secretly into communication with His Majesty s Government as to the conditions udder which delegates could attend the London discussion and the campaign of violence in Palestine could be arrested His Majesty s Government were unable to agree to this suggestion, as they telt that it would be impracticable to enter into negotiations which must inevitably touch on questions of policy before the arrival of the delegates to the r lhe y ex P lain ed that they had not necessarily excluded any ot the Mufti s adherents from participation in the discussions as delegates of the {; alestm e Arabs, and foreshadowed the release of the deportees from the beycheiles. Ibn Saud received this news with great satisfaction. Mr PhidhwW ih ft T f^ 8 1 ari ; ival / n Ri y adh Sir R- Bullard was told by n r th ? t th . e latter had at last persuaded Ibn Saud to throw off his attitude of subservience to His Majesty’s Government and to grant him an interview for publication. Mr. Philby said that he had sent an fccount o7 the interview to various papers m Egypt and England as well as to the Oriente Moderno (a learned monthly review published in Italy) and to a German h^vtiT i t0 i Mr - Philby ’ Ibn Saild had committed himself on Two p ts he had said that it was unjust to take land away from the Arabs to give SirV^llTSV^ lf a f Jewish State was set up, he would not recognise g it ^ F m ? U a ur n ° actlon on th]S mf ormation, supposing that the interview would be published and speak for itself. No printed Account of the interview came to his notice until the legation received in December the November issue of the Onente Moderno, which gave the place of honour to Mr. Philby’s article. The i° n f ^ es P ect w i t}l the oral account given by Mr. Philby it s t ated that Ibn Saud declared that his attitude towards a Jewish State if nnp should be set up, would be that of the other Arabs. ’ Re twTT nju an , in tc rvi ew on the 14th November Ibn Saud told Sir R. Bullard that he had sent advice to the Iraq Government and to people in Palestine not condftTonrbeforeS 06 AtTh Mufti T' the i L ° ndon discussi °ns or to lay down PomT cciniehand. At the same time he spoke very strongly about the Matty’s ^Governmen^t Lond ° n ^ hould P I0ve fruitless and His majesty s government should decide to continue their present nolicv thev r3.ii 7 »”Cdoif ! §1“omd P h!**m* A ™ b “ wouI &lt;&gt; maintain' thair .now a™*,, „ r low, a. r&amp;s m Palestine as the Jews were being treated in Germany. With the world in its17 [18903] e* 2 present state, it was futile to discuss whether the Balfour Declaration was justifiable or not; the point was, what w T as possible now? (His remarks implied here that the continuance of Jewish immigration was impossible because it would be fatal to His Majesty’s Government.) As with Czecho-Slovakia, some ^ sacrifice must be made to avoid a greater evil. It would be tragic if, in case of a general conflict, the Arabs should be forced to join the enemies of Great Britain. The Arabs did not trust Italy and Germany, but desperate men would accept help from any quarter. 60. In the course of this interview Ibn Saud gave a very obscure hint that, if His Majesty’s Government adopted a new policy requiring assistance and called in someone else (i.e., the Amir Abdullah) rather than their loyal friend and supporter Ibn Saud, he would feel aggrieved. Fortunately, the remark was so vague that Sir R. Bullard was able to meet it for the moment by a repetition of an assurance which His Majesty’s Government had sent not long before, that His Majesty’s Government gave their confidence to no one in the Arab world more than to His Majesty. 61. When reporting this interview to His Majesty’s Government, Sir R. Bullard said that Ibn Saud had shown a very helpful attitude, but that it would be useless to expect that his delegates would acquiesce in any scheme involving further Jewish immigration. He added that Ibn Saud had quoted phrases from the German broadcasts about the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government, which were just beginning, and had implied that we must expect worse to follow. 62. The Imam of the Yemen telegraphed to Ibn Saud when the statement of policy was published and asked advice as to what he should do if invited to send a representative to the London discussions. Later, he said that he was inclined to await the decision of the Palestine Arabs, as they had always declined to discuss the question with the Jews. 63. On the 17th November His Majesty’s Government telegraphed to Sir R. Bullard the official invitation for Ibn Saud to send a representative to the London discussions, asked who the delegate would be, and expressed the hope that he would be their guest during his visit to London. They stated at the same time that, while the exact procedure that would be followed could not be laid down exactly, it should be made clear to Ibn Saud that the Saudi Government were being invited to send a representative for discussion, in the first place, with His Majesty’s Government, who would at the same time discuss with representatives of the Jewish Agency. The message added, for the information of the minister, that they felt that the prospect of success would be seriously endangered if an attempt were made to start with anything like a round-table conference, though it was hoped that the discussions might develop into that at a later stage. 64. Ibn Saud accepted the formal invitation, but asked that his acceptance should not be made public until that of Egypt and Iraq could also be made known. Lie said that he was disposed to appoint the Amir Faisal as his repre sentative. Being asked by Fuad Bey as to the suitability of this appointment, Sir R. Bullard did not attempt to discourage it, feeling that the only alternative candidates were Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, either of whom would be less amenable than the Amir to any influence which the Foreign Office could exercise through the Saudi Minister in London. Later, Ibn Saud confirmed the choice of the Amir Faisal. At the end of December he instructed Fuad Bey to go to London with the Amir. This was perhaps because of his decision to utilise the chance offered by the presence of the Amir in England to bring up all-important pending questions. 65. On leaving Riyadh for Jedda, Sir R. Bullard reported Ibn Saud as having set forth his views thus : The King still held friendship with His Majesty’s Government to be essential for him and for all Arabs in spite of advances from “certain other Powers.” If he thought His Majesty’s Govern ment were hostile to the Arabs or to Islam he would be the first to take arms against them, but he did not. He believed that they were now going to give the Arabs their rights—not, perhaps, everything the Arabs demanded, but very18 nearly. It would not be difficult to safeguard the rights of His Majesty s Govern ment in Palestine. If the Palestine Arabs made difficulties on that point ic would see about it. It was he who was the leader of the Arab people, no certain people who put themselves forward (a hit at Taufiq buaidi). 66. When transmitting the above account of Ibn baud s views, Sir P. Bullard said that he felt that, so far as Ibn Saud went, it was our last chance. I wo commissions had kept Ibn Saud in play for two years and he had reiused o take part openly against us, on the ground that we should do justice to the Arabs in the long run. Justice to Ibn Saud meant above all the stoppage ot Jewish immigration. If after the London discussions immigration was com tinued against the desire of the Palestine Arabs, he feared that Ibn Saud would conclude that His Majesty’s Government were after all hostile to the Arabs, and this would be a great personal humiliation to him and a triumph for the Arab extremists who had laughed at him for putting his trust in His Majesty s Government. The main inducement the partition scheme had offered the Arabs was that it put a limit to Jewish encroachment, and it seemed to Sir R. Bullard that, partition being ruled out, the line ought to be drawn at the very high mark which Jewish immigration had already reached. Otherwise it was difficult to see what could keep the Arabs favourable or even neutral to us if, for example, in the course of a general conflict, Germany should offer, if successful, not only to cancel the Balfour Declaration, but to eject from Palestine all the Jews who had gone there since 1918. German propaganda about Palestine was bound to damage us severely in the Arab east, where our sympathy with the German Jews would generally be regarded either as hypocrisy or as a proof that as between Arabs and Jews we were grossly partial. Now was the easiest moment to give way on the immigration question, with the reports of the two commissions as material. If we did not do so it was to be feared that the armed struggle would continue, and if Ibn Saud then showed his sympathy openly with the “rebels” we could hardly blame him. 67. In reply His Majesty’s Government defined their attitude on the question of immigration. They did not intend to commit themselves before hand, but to listen sympathetically to the Arab case in the hope of arriving at a decision in consultation with them. They appreciated Ibn Sand’s position and never contemplated his even acquiescing in the continuance of immigration unless the Arabs did so too. But they were not convinced that immigration should be entirely stopped. It was evident that if the London discussions were to succeed concessions would have to be made on both sides, and it might be found that the Arabs would accept some level of Jewish immigration as part of a scheme giving them guarantees against Jewish domination. His Majesty’s Government asked whether it was necessary to reply to Ibn Saud on this point, but His Majesty’s Minister agreed with them that this was unnecessary. 68. It would be both wearisome and useless to trace in detail the course of the negotiations preliminary to the London discussions. They were complicated by physical distance and the time taken for communication between the five centres concerned—London, Cairo, Bagdad, Riyadh and Syria—and by the desire of Ibn Saud, the Egyptian Prime Minister, and the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Taufiq Suaidi, not to allow any of the others to take precedence of him. It was not until late in December that Llis Majesty’s Government were able to announce the acceptance by the Governments of Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia of the invitation to the London discussions, and the representatives of the Palestine Arabs still remained to be elected when the year came to an end. 69. Although it is clear that Ibn Saud does not trust the Mufti, and that from the beginning he urged moderation on him and his followers, he eventually put forward for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government a list of five candidates who were all extremists, viz., Jamil-al-Husaini, Izzat Darwaza, Amin Tamimi, Hilmi Pasha and Alfred Rock. To this proposal His Majesty’s Minister, under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, sent a long reasoned reply, partly official and partly personal, saying that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to accept as representatives of the Palestine Arabs those persons who might be named by Ibn Saud after careful consideration and consultation with Arab opinion. They would accept any or all of the five already suggested,19 [18903] but they adduced reasons for attempting to secure a delegation really repre sentative of all shades of opinion in Palestine, offered to receive up to seven or eight delegates, and gave a list of seven persons from which additional names might be chosen. As some of these names were those of persons not known for moderation this was a generous offer. Moreover, the Seychelles deportees had already been released and pardoned. 70. This message from His Majesty’s Government was accompanied by a request for complete secrecy as to the source of their suggestions, as it was essential that the choice should appear to come from the Arab side. His Majesty’s Government also asked whether Ibn Saud had been in consultation with the Egyptian Government: they had already some time before pointed out to him how important it was, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, that the Government of Egypt should not feel that they had been left out in the cold. This message had the effect of inducing Ibn Saud to intensify contact with Egypt (he was already in close touch with Iraq), but the selection of the delegates was delayed by the manoeuvres of the Mufti, who decided to await the arrival of the Seychelles deportees. By this time His Majesty’s Government, who had originally hoped that the discussions might begin by the middle of December, had provisionally fixed the 18th January for them to begin, and were hoping that the Palestine delegates might be selected by the end of the year—a hope which was not, in fact, fulfilled. 71 On the 12th December there arrived from Ibn Saud an immense memo randum which showed how anxious he w T as that His Majesty s Government should realise the extent of the efforts he was making to help to bring about the London discussions under the best auspices. It recounted in full his negotia tions with Iraq and with the Mufti, and quoted the sound arguments which he had used with them to modify their intransigence. It also showed that the Mufti was claiming to have found greater encouragement in Cairo than in Riyadh, and Ibn Saud asked anxiously whether His Majesty’s Government were likely to give in to the Mufti’s obstinacy or to make greater concessions to any other Arab authority than to His Majesty—questions to which His Majesty s Government returned the most categorical negative. 72. On the 19th December the new Egyptian Minister, Abdul Rahman Bey Azzam, suggested to Fuad Bey, as a means of concentrating effort and influencing the Mufti, that representatives of Egypt and Iraq and Saudi Arabia should meet m Cairo to try to secure acceptance of an agreed list of delegates by the! alestine Arabs. This proposal eventually grew into a suggestion from the Egyptian Prime Minister that the persons who were to represent the three countries at the London discus sion should meet in Egypt for preliminary discussion. Ibn Saud accepted this proposal, and arrangements were eventually made for the A mil Faisal and his suite to leave for Egypt on the 9th January, 1939. 73 The action of the German Government against the Jews in Geimany led to a demand in the United Kingdom that some 20,000 German-Jewish refugees should be admitted into Palestine, among them 10,000 Jewish children whom Jewish residents in Palestine had undertaken to adopt. His Majesty s Go\ein- ment asked His Majesty's representatives in Cairo, Bagdad and Jedda whether, so far as they could judge, feeling in Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia against the admission of, say, 5,000 Jewish children for adoption, if publicly announced as a humanitarian measure, would be so strong as to lead to a lefusal to send representatives to the London discussions. All three replies weie stiongly against the proposal, which was not proceeded with. 74. The attitude of President Roosevelt towards the Palestine question induced Ibn Saud to send him a letter of protest and appeal. 75 His Majesty’s Minister noticed in December that one number of the Saut-al-Hijaz contained two articles on Palestine which were a little more outspoken than usual, and immediately afterwards he was informed by Fuad Bey that in view of the criticism which had been directed against the oihcial newspaper the Umm-al-Qura, for its silence on the subject of Palestine, the King had decided to allow it rather more latitude. The next number of the Umm-al- Qura did, in fact, contain a leading article on Palestine which, though very moderate as Arab articles on Palestine go, marked a step fiom which it would20 be difficult for Ibn Baud to draw back. A much longer step, however, has been marked by the interview granted to Mr. Philby on the 12th August, wmc appeared in the November number of the Oriente Moderno. Apart from the two pronouncements which have been quoted in paragraph 58 above, the King ma e a very damaging comparison between our concern for the Jews m Germany ana what he considers our indifference to the rights of the Arabs m Palestine. How can Europe, he asks, criticise Germany and other countries for driving out Jews from territories where they form a majority, and find nothing to criticise in an attempt to drive out the Arabs from their own country in order that the Jews may live there? 76. It was after Ibn Baud had made this criticism that partition was abandoned, and that the invitation to the London discussions indicated a change in the policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Palestine, and still later (the 24th November) that the speech of the Secretary of State for the Colonies showed how sincere was the desire of His Majesty’s Government that full weight should now be given to the views and feelings of the Arabs. From Ibn Baud s point of view the prospect now looks promising, but if nothing comes of the discussions his position will no longer be what it has been hitherto. After supporting the Arab case in London, as on the whole he must do, and after his pronouncements in the press, he cannot slip back into silence. To what extent he has given the Palestine rebels secret help in the way of arms and money is mainly a matter of conjecture; but if the policy adopted by His Majesty’s Government after the London discussions is not, on broad lines, satisfactory to the Arabs, we must not be surprised if Ibn Baud becomes openly hostile, however much it would go against the grain with him to embark upon an open quarrel with His Majesty’s Government. Transjordan. 77. Among the propaganda about Palestine which was introduced into the Hejaz during the pilgrimage season were photostat copies of what purported to be and apparently was a letter from the Amir Abdullah to the High Commissioner for Transjordan at Jerusalem, setting forth the Amir’s suspicions of the policy of Saudi Arabia. This letter, which was written during the Saudi-Yemen war, described the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia as being run mainly through Fuad Bey and and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin by extremists like the Mufti and Shakib Arslan, and as being aimed at the Yemen in the first instance and, secondly, at Transjordan. Moreover, it accused these persons as having connexions with “ two European Powers who for a long time have had great ambitions on the Red Sea coast.” A copy of this photostat was given to His Majesty’s Minister by Fuad Bey without comment. As propaganda it was probably very effective with Ibn Baud, who must have resented strongly the assumption that he did not run the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia but was a cat’s-paw in the hands of Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. 78. An incident which occurred in January will not have enhanced the reputation of the Amir Abdullah as a sensible man in the eyes of Ibn Saud. The Amir telegraphed to Ibn Saud asking whether the dues could be remitted on about 150 pilgrims who wished to proceed to Mecca by land. Ibn Saud replied that the dues were fixed by law, but that he would pay the dues on the pilgrims in question out of his own pocket provided that the Amir would guarantee them— meaning guarantee that they would behave themselves and would not become destitute. The Amir took this grand seigneur reply quite calmly and accepted the financial offer, and said that he would find guarantors but that most of the pilgrims were Syrians. As Syrians are not under the Government of Transjordan and the Amir obviously could not guarantee them, Ibn Saud asked for the help of His Majesty’s Legation in elucidating the obscure affair. It turned out that the pilgrims in question, of whom some forty were natives of Transjordan, had been intercepted in Transjordan in an attempt to evade the passport and sanitary controls and to proceed to Saudi Arabia by an unauthorised route, that they had appealed to the Amir in the mosque, and that on an impulse he had telegraphed to Ibn Saud. The Amir had not consulted the British Resident beforehand, and there was no reason why such assistance as he requested from Ibn Saud should be afforded. Finally, the Amir absolved Ibn Saud of any obligation under which he might have placed himself in the matter, Ibn Saud expressed his thanks to His Majesty’s Minister, and the matter was closed.[18903] e* 4 21 79. There have been more complaints from the Saudi Government this year than last about alleged violations of the frontier. It would be unprofitable to go into detail here, the more so as it is not believed that there have, in fact, been more occasions for complaint. It seems probable that the protests indicate mainly ^ the desire of owners of guilty consciences to forestall criticism. Saudi officials and soldiers, who find in tax-collection pickings which help to make up for arrears of pay, are much inclined to disregard the frontier when in pursuit of tax-evading tribesmen, and this year there was probably a more important reason also for a feeling of guilt on the Saudi side : the authorities in Palestine and Transjordan believe firmly that there were serious attempts to smuggle arms and ammunition out of Saudi Arabia for use by the Palestine malcontents. When His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November he suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that some of the complaints which the Saudi Government had transmitted came from officials who were conscious of having committed such offences themselves, and Sheikh Yusuf did not deny that this was possible. 80. Here is an interesting instance. In March the Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to complain that soldiers from Transjordan had arrived at Haql intending to search for a fugitive from Transjordan and to arrest him with his companions. They protested against this &lt;c armed violation of the frontier,” requested that the persons responsible should be punished, and reserved the right to claim compensation later. The facts were these : Four men who had been deported to Akaba for participation in the troubles in the Ajlun district fled into Saudi territory. Two Transjordan jundis, who had followed their tracks, went to the Saudi post at Haql and made enquiries, but on being informed by the head of the post that he could do nothing for them, they withdrew. The Transjordan authorities had found in the quarters from which the men had fled a letter apparently written to one of them by the head of the Haql post and giving reason to believe that it was with his connivance that the men had escaped into Saudi territory. Major Glubb, Officer Commanding the Desert Area, Transjordan, dealt with the matter in an admirable letter to the Saudi Frontier Inspector, giving the facts, sending a copy of the letter believed to be from the head of the Haql post, and pointing out that jundis from Saudi Arabia frequently came to posts in Transjordan territory without warning, and that the Transjordan authorities, far from objecting, gave them a good welcome. At the request of the High Commissioner for Transjordan, His Majesty’s Minister apologised to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the technical breach of article 10 of the Hadda Agreement which the Transjordan jundis had committed in following a fugitive across the frontier, but he stressed the other points in Major Glubb’s defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs eventually stated that the Officer Commanding Haql Post denied the authorship of the letter, and maintained, though very mildly, their protest about the following up of fugitives into Saudi territory. * 80a. A difference of opinion arose out of the murder of a certain Farhan, a Saudi subject, who was killed in his sleep and robbed in Transjordan territory. The Transjordan authorities caught the culprits and sentenced them to payment of blood-money, but the Saudi Government objected to this as an unsuitable penalty for a death resulting from a cold-blooded attack on a sleeping man and not from a tribal quarrel; had such a case occurred in Saudi Arabia, they declared, they would have executed the murderer. It was pointed out to them that the relevant paragraph in the schedule referred to in article 7 of the Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Yoisinage ” of 1933 does not distinguish between different forms of homicide from the point of view of the penalty. The Saudi Government then raised another point under the influence of their old bugbear : fear of discriminatory treatment. Did the Transjordan Government, they asked, treat Saudi subjects residing or travelling in Transjordan less favourably than the subjects of other States? The High Commissioner for Transjordan was able to provide a reply which put an end to the correspondence; the murderers were tried under the Bedouin Control Law because the murdered man and his assailants were Bedouin, the criterion being whether the persons concerned are Bedouin or not, and not the State of which they are nationals. 81. A suggestion from Koweit that natives of Nejd (and Koweit) were being enlisted in the Transjordan frontier force was easily disposed of by Major Glubb, who showed that he had only one Nejdi in the ranks—a runaway who had left Nejd two years before and for whose pardon he had sent n personal appeal22 to Ibn Saud. This is a technical breach of article 10 of the ireaty of 1933, but no more. On the other hand, Major Glubb considers that there is good reason to believe that, in spite of the treaty provision against tribal enticement, Ibn Saud is giving salaries to at least two or three Transjordan sheikhs in order to induce them to remain in Saudi territory. When speaking about frontier incidents to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in November, His Majesty’s Minister asked whether it was possible for the enticement of Transjordan sheikhs to take place without the knowledge of the King, and received an indignant denial. It would be difficult to put forward specific charges, but the vague enquiry may be useful. 82. Nejd merchants trading in Transjordan or passing through to trade in Syria have certain grievances which the legation have done their best to under stand, but without much success, chiefly because the Saudi Government themselves do not appear to grasp fully what the cause of the trouble is. A reference in a recent report from Major Glubb suggests that complaints on this point have reached his ears, and His Majesty’s Minister has asked the High Commissioner for Transjordan whether the opinion of Major Glubb can be obtained. One complaint which is clear is against the practice followed by the Transjordan authorities in requiring the duty on Saudi goods in transit to Syria to be deposited on entry and only refunding it on proof of re-export. This practice, which is normal in transit trade procedure is declared by the Saudi Government to be contrary to the provisions of article 13 of the Hadda Agreement, which requires the transit trade to submit to customs inspection, but makes no mention of the deposit of duty. 83. Ibn Zaid was removed from his post as Saudi Frontier Inspector early in the year and replaced by Abdul Aziz-al-Sudairi, a member of a family related by marriage to Ibn Saud. It has been suggested that the Palestine question brought about this change in that Ibn Saud felt that the post should be held by someone in whom he had complete trust. Sudairi may have been responsible for a renewal of Saudi intrigues which was noticed among Transjordan tribes, but Major Glubb reported that the relations with the new inspector had much improved by the end of the year. 84. His Majesty’s Minister always tries to keep the Saudi Government to the procedure laid down in article 3 of the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Treaty of 1933, for direct negotiations between the Saudi and Transjordan frontier officials, but on one occasion the Minister for Foreign Affairs asked what they were to do when the offenders were themselves officials, and stated that the main cause of the difficulty was the lack of a Saudi representative in Transjordan. The first objection called for the retort that even if minor officials violated the frontier, which is not admitted, the frontier inspector could always communicate direct with Major Glubb, as indeed he had done on many occasions; but unfortunately the reply was delayed until it was no longer worth making. The reference to the lack of a Saudi representative in Transjordan touches a thorny question (paragraph 9 of 1937). If the Saudis are given a representative at Amman in accordance with their treaty right, the Italians, who applied in 1937 for permis sion to establish a consular post at Amman, will expect their application to be granted. However, the subject was raised formally by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who spoke of it to Sir R. Bullard in November, so the instructions of the Foreign Office were asked for. The Yemen. 85. The only trouble between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia that was heard of during the year was a slight recrudescence of the dispute about water rights at Haradh, which was supposed to have been settled in 1937 (paragraph 43 of 1937 report). According to a report from Aden, the Saudi dues on Yemeni pilgrims proceeding to Mecca overland were raised from £1 gold and 2 riyals to gold, but if this caused any resentment in the Yemen it was not loud enough to reach the legation. 86. The Saudi-Yemen frontier agreement of the 2nd November, 1937 (paragraph 50 of 1937),contains sensible provisions,which are perhaps taken from the corresponding agreement with Transjordan, for direct correspondence between the frontier officials with the object of settling disputes speedilv. It also contains one provision which is an improvement upon the state of affairs on the northern[18903] F * 23 fee frontier of Saudi Arabia: “Cases settled in accordance with the recognised Shara law cannot be considered or brought np a second time.” The Transjordan authorities have frequently found that judgments and decisions which were final in Transjordan had been upset by Saudi officials when the parties later found themselves in Saudi territory. The key to the acceptance of a more reasonable procedure in the case of the Yemen is perhaps to be found in the words “ recognised Shara law.” 87. When speaking in the first Arabic broadcast from London in January, the Amir Saif-ai-Islam Husain referred to his father as Amir A1 Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers). This seemed to give a slight shock to Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who were listening with His Majesty’s Minister. Sir R. Bullard spoke to Fuad Bey about this, referring to the fact that the Italian Government had given the Imam Yahya this title when they renewed their treaty with the Yemen in 1937, and to a report that at the time of the conclusion of the treaty which brought the Saudi-Yemeni war to an end, the King of the Yemen had undertaken not to style himself Amir A1 Mu’minin. Fuad Bey, who affected indifference which it is suspected he did not feel on the subject, said that all that happened between Ibn Sand and the King of the Yemen was that to avoid a controversial point each of the two parties was described in the treaty as “ imam,” which in Saudi Arabia implies nothing more than the right to take the lead in the prayers. 88. Ibn Saud has not repeated this year his prophecies of an eventual revolt in the Yemen, but when talking to Flis Majesty’s Minister in March he referred to the Imam as a ridiculous old gentleman who was always fussing about something. There was Philby’s journey, for instance. And now he affected to fear British expansion towards Najran, and wanted to know what Ibn Saud intended to do about it. On this occasion Ibn Saud described the Yemenis as thoroughly factious, savage and untrustworthy, and related various tales in support of his accusations. 89. In connexion with the Imam’s attempt to induce Ibn Saud to join with him in an appeal to His Majesty’s Government and Italy about Palestine (paragraph 42)' Ibn Saud stated that the Imam frequently consulted him about all sorts of things. The Imam did, in fact, telegraph to Ibn Saud asking what he thought about the news that the Yemen was to be invited to send a representa tive to the London discussions about Palestine. He does not seem to have consulted Ibn Saud before occupying Shabwa, but, having got into difficulties, he appears to have accepted Ibn Sand’s offer of mediation with some eagerness. 90. The Shabwa question is dealt with in the section on the Aden Protectorate. Aden Protectorate. 91. In a lecture which is published in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society for July and August 1938, Mr. Philby claims that, in the time of Faisal, grandfather of the present Ibn Saud, Wahabi territory extended right down to the head of the Hadhramaut Valley, and states that at al ’Abr there can still be seen traces of a fort garrisoned by Faisal’s troops to command the wells and keep the Sai’ar tribe in order. Ibn Saud, with his views on his ancestral claims, is not likely to differ from Mr. Philby on this point in theory, but he is too wise to allow Mr. Philby to push him into conflict with His Majesty’s Government, and his most extreme claims in the south are still well to the north of al ’Abr. 92. In an interview in March Ibn Saud told His Majesty’s Minister that he had been approached by various people from the Hadhramaut, and that he had told them that if they were not under the British they would be under some other foreign Power, and that, therefore, they might think themselves fortunate. He had also, it appeared, lectured them on their faults: their unending internal quarrels and the brigandage on the roads. But, he said to Sir R. Bullard, they could be managed with a little care. Mr. Philby, he admitted, did not agree with his policy in regard to the Hadhramaut. “ He says I am a Conservative. And I am a Conservative.” This was confirmed not long afterwards when Mr. Philby said to Sir R, Bullard : “ Ibn Saud won’t take any interest in Shabwa. I wish he would. He has made me a present of Shabwa.”24 93. Early in May His Majesty’s Minister received instructions to inform Ibn Saud that the Imam had made troop movements which appeared to be aimed at Shabwa and al ’Abr, and that, as his replies to a telegram on the subject from the Government of Aden had been equivocal, the Imam, to whom a conciliatory reply was being sent in reply to a complaint which he had made about Shabwa, ^ was being warned that, in the event of a Yemeni advance into the Aden Protectorate, retaliatory action would be taken by the Royal Air Force. This information was given to Ibn Saud in accordance with the arrangement for the exchange of information about the Yemen which had been agreed upon during Mr. Renders visit to Jedda in 1937, but His Majesty’s Government also had in mind article 3 of the Saudi-Iraqi-Yemeni Treaty providing for joint endeavours by the signatories to find a situation by peaceful means and friendly negotiations should a situation arise involving a threat of war between one of them and another State. 94. A long and involved telegram was received from Ibn Saud in reply to this communication. He said that the Imam had doubtless been instigated by the Italians, whose attitude would, however, presumably change now that the agreement with His Majesty’s Government had been signed, and that the people of Shabwa wanted neither the Imam nor the British, but to be free. He did not seem to think that the Imam was receiving encouragement from people on the Aden side of the frontier. He added that His Majesty’s Government might be well advised to employ experienced persons to explain their intentions to the population, e.g., that they have no designs on the country, and to give the population a share of its resources. Sir R. Bullard concluded that this last point was a reference to the oil which is supposed to exist near Shabwa. He noticed that Ibn Saud showed no sign of readiness to intervene in the dispute. A later telegram from the King confirmed this reading of his view : it expressed anodyne hopes of peace, and confidence in the wisdom and experience of His Majesty’s Government. Towards the end of May the Government of Aden, who had learned that the Imam had sent Ibn Saud a long telegram in cypher and supposed that the subject might be the Anglo-Yemeni dispute, suggested than an attempt should be made at Jedda to find out whether that supposition was correct and if the Imam was consulting the Saudi Government, that it should be urged upon them to advise the Imam not to send troops to Shabwa and other points in dispute and not to quarrel with His Majesty’s Government about them. Sir R Bullard waited a few days, thinking that if Ibn Saud had been consulted by the Imam, he might inform His Majesty’s Government spontaneously and that 'it would not be well to show too great eagerness, but having received from the Foreign Office a request for his comments on the Aden proposal, he sent Ibn Saud a message referring to the latter’s replies on the subject and saying that he would be grateful tor any additional comments that His Majesty might be able to make Ibn Saud replied that the Imam never consulted him on “ internal ” questions : he probablv would have done, but Ibn Saud had always ridden him off lest the Imam should suspect him of having personal aims. The affairs of the Yemen, he said were involved and unintelligible : no sensible man would interfere, and he did not want to do so. This reply ruled out any such request as the Aden Government had had m mind. . l 9 Y^&lt;? leSSag , e sent by Mr - Philb y&gt; th en at Riyadh, to the EqypHan Gazette on the 25th September, contained these passages :—^ r ' Ref ^g ees wh° arrived recently at Najran have reported to the Wahabi Goyetnoi there that Shabwa was occupied without opposition about a fortnight ago by a small detachment of Yemeni troops The occupa- lon of Shabwa appears to have been a very peaceful affair as the party favounng mcorporatmn m Saudi Arabia withdrew from the district to avoid trouble. Ibn Saud has steadily declined to give the Saudi partv anv encouragement in order to avoid complications with the British Government ^ Wnf ° P r f ? nS1 T t0 the sovere ignty of Shabwa, although no secGon of the local population has ever recognised the British claim.” 96. When His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November he received from the Foreign Office a copy of a communication which His Mafestv’s Ambassador in Rome was to make to the Italian Government regaS the Shabwa situation. It stated that Yemeni troops had occupied sfabwa by a25 [18903] F * 2 process of infiltration, and as the Imam had rejected repeated offers from the Aden Government that the Shabwa district should be neutralised pending the settlement of the frontier question, His Majesty’s Government had been obliged to send him an ultimatum, stating that unless he withdrew his forces by the 28th November the Government of Aden would be obliged to eject them. Sir R. Bullard used the discretion allowed him and conveyed this information to Ibn Saud. The King was disturbed at the news, as he felt that hostilities between His Majesty’s Government and the Imam might prejudice the Palestine discussions which were to take place in London, and he asked whether His Majesty’s Government would accept his mediation and whether they could post pone military action to allow him to communicate with the Imam. His Majesty’s Minister recommended these suggestions to His Majesty’s Government, in spite of his knowledge that the Imam had been exceedingly trying and of the fact that Ibn Saud had shown no inclination to assist when informed of the situation in May. His Majesty’s Government gladly accepted Ibn Baud’s offer of mediation, in so far as his efforts could be directed towards bringing about the evacuation of Shabwa by the Imam, but explained that to delay the threatened action to eject his troops was impossible. They stated, however, that even after the ejection of the Yemeni troops from Shabwa they were prepared to withdraw the British forces provided that the Imam would undertake not to reoccupy it pending discussion of the question of the common frontier. 97. Shortly afterwards His Majesty’s Government were able to inform Ibn Saud that Shabwa had been reoccupied without a shot being fired, and that the Yemeni forces were being repatriated. Having got himself into this hole the Imam gladly seized the offer of mediation held out to him by Ibn Saud. He asked, however, that not only Shabw r a but also al Abr should be neutralised pending a settlement of the frontier question, but His Majesty’s Government explained to Ibn Saud that al ’Abr had been occupied from Mukalla some months before not as a threat to the Yemen but solely in order to prevent raids by the Sai’ar, which might begin again if al ’Abr was evacuated. His Majesty’s Government were, however, considering whether it would not be possible to neutralise al ’Abr as well as Shabwa if the agreement of the Imam could be secured on no other terms, but it was naturally not possible to tell Ibn Saud this. On the other hand, Ibn Saud could hardly be expected to try to induce the Imam to agree to the terms of His Majesty’s Government, for he evidently thought that no great harm would come if al 'Abr also was included in the area to be neutralised. Sir R. Bullard did, however, ask him to disabuse the Imam of a fantastic notion he professed to hold, that the policy which had led to the extension of control to Shabwa and al 'Abr was not that of His Majesty’s Government, but was put into execution by a few young and irresponsible officials. Sir R. Bullard suggested to His Majesty’s Government that if they decided to give way on the question of al ’Abr there might be advantages in letting Ibn Saud have some of the credit: to attribute withdrawal in part to the friendly representations of Ibn Saud might spare the dignity of His Majesty’s Government: moreover, it might induce the Imam to consult Ibn Saud in future about his foreign affairs, which might be very useful. 98. It is inevitable that when resident in this country Hadhramis, like Yemenis, should tend to be absorbed at least temporarily into the local population. The attempts of property-owning Hadhramis to have the best of both worlds has been recorded more than once; they wished to continue to enjoy possession of their real property in spite of the prohibition of the ownership of such property by foreigners, and to receive support from His Majesty s Legation to that end. The promulgation of the Saudi Regulation on the Residence of Foreigners (paragraph 3) brought out into the open many Hadhramis who had hitherto not made themselves known to His Majesty’s Legation but were anxious for assistance when it was a question of paying some 165. a year for the privilege of being foreigners. This annual tax, which is a considerable sum as compared with local rates of pay, will in many cases be sufficient to decide waverers into taking out Saudi papers, as many have already done in order to be able to remain in employ ment as chauffeurs and the like, or merely in order to be left in peace. It is for the authorities of the Aden Protectorate to say whether they wish to take this process seriously. \Yhen the lists of foreigners who have acquired Saudi nationality appear in the press, His Majesty’s Legation pick only any obviously20 Hadhrami names and send them to the Governor of Aden, but until the co-opera tion of the Saudi authorities can be secured, to keep track of all such cases s impossible, and it is probable that many Hadhramis who have lived liere ioi years with Saudi papers regard the fact as of no importance and consider them selves as Hadhramis when outside the borders of Saudi Arabia. Muscat and Oman. 99. Nothing to report. Tracial Sheikhs and Qatar. 100. The feeling of contempt which the Sand family feel for the ruling family of Qatar (paragraph 59 of 1937) was expressed to His Majesty’s Minister bv the Amir Saud more politely when he praised the Sheikh of Bahrein as being different from the smaller Gulf sheikhs, who were rather Boeotian. There is little to record under this heading this year. The negotiations about the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, which are dealt with elsewhere, affect Ibn Sand’s neighbours, but the neighbours take no direct part in them. In a conversation with His Majesty’s Minister late in the year Ibn Saud showed that he took a lively interest in the Zubara question (paragraph 56 of 1937), and he appeared to side with the Sheikh of Bahrein on this issue. Bahrein. 101. The return visit of the Sheikh of Bahrein (paragraph 61 of 1937), which was combined with the pilgrimage, was a complete success. From the moment when he arrived in H.M.S. Londonderry, which had brought him from Aden, the sheikh was treated with friendliness and respect by all Saudis from the King down. It had been proposed that he should return to Bahrein across Arabia, but in the end he travelled to Bombay in the first—-and the best—of the returning pilgrim ships. Apparently Ibn Saud found it difficult to provide land transport for the sheikh and his party at a time when he had to prepare for the journey of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone from Jedda to the Gulf, and the attention of the sheikh was gently diverted to the sea route. Among the presents which the sheikh took away with him were eleven motor cars, and forty rifles and 4,000 rounds of ammunition. 102. The Amir Saud, when speaking to His Majesty's Minister about the visit soon afterwards, spoke of the sheikh with high appreciation. The visit was also the subject of a flowery article in the Umm-al-Qura, in which the phrase “ Moslem friendship and Arab brotherhood ” appeared about five times. 103. In November Ibn Saud spoke to His Majesty’s Minister with sympathy of the Sheikh of Bahrein, whose administration had recently been the object of violent demonstrations which the King attributed to Persian intrigues. He evinced feelings of solidarity with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit, and it was evident that he was thinking not only of the traditional bonds between them, but of the common interest of important Arab rulers in preserving their position against democratic interference other than the obligation which rests upon a Moslem ruler to ask the views of such people as he thinks fit to consult. 104. Ibn Saud’s personal liking for the Sheikh of Bahrein, with whom he appears to side in the Zubara dispute, does not prevent his wishing to escape from dependence upon Bahrein as a port of transit for imports into Saudi Arabia —a galling arrangement which hurts both his pocket and his pride. Towards the end of the year his hopes began to be fulfilled when Ras Tanura was inaugurated as a port of call for steamers which formerly could only land at Bahrein any cargo consigned to Saudi Arabia. 105. In October the Saudi Government protested against the placing of a mark by the Bahrein Government on an island which they claimed to be Saudi territory. They gave the name of the island as Libaina. The island is probably one of two islands both of which are considered by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to be Bahrein territory. No reply had, however, been sent to the Saudi Government by the end of the year. *27 106. A scurrilous article attacking the Bahrein Administration which appeared in an obscure Egyptian paper was traced with almost complete certainty to a Hejazi journalist named Abdullah-al-Mazru, who is connected with the Mecca newspaper, Saut-al-Hijaz. Mazru denied that he had been in Bahrein, but Fuad Bey admitted to His Majesty’s Minister that the man had been ^ in Bahrein, and that it was highly undesirable that such attacks should emanate from a person connected with the Saudi press. 107. At the beginning of the year it was found that the Saudi authorities in Hasa were endorsing on the passports of all persons leaving the mainland for Bahrein a formula which might be read as permission to enter Bahrein, and were charging for it the large fee of 4/12 rupees. The subsequent negotiations took many months, chiefly because of the absence of Fuad Bey on leave, but by the end of the year the objectionable formula had been exchanged for one more closely conforming to international usage, and the fee for Bahrein subjects had been reduced to the equivalent of about 15. Qd. Whether the arrangement is satis factory to the Government of Bahrein has, however, yet to be learned. Koweit. 108. It is customary for certain tribal sections from Saudi Arabia to winter in Koweit, where the grazing is better, but in the winter of 1937-38 the contrast between the drought in Saudi Arabia (for the second year m succession) and the good rains in Koweit led to a great influx into Koweit of Saudi tribesmen from as far away as the Yemen border and the neighbourhood of the Rub-al-Khali. Implicit in the permission granted by Ibn Saud to Saudi tribes to oraze in Koweit is permission to restock in the Koweit market, but this year Ibn Saud also allowed all the Bedouin living in Nejd near the common frontier to go to Koweit to make their purchases. 109. In March the Saudi Government accepted the latest draft of the proposed Koweit Agreement pretty much as it was, and said that they were ready to examine the text of the two subsidiary agreements. Drafts of the latter (“ Bon-Voisinage ” and Extradition) were prepared by the political agent at Koweit and discussed by the departments concerned in London, but as between the legation and the Saudi Government the subject remained dormant until, when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November, Ibn Saud made the surprising statement that he would like the agreement to come into force as soon as possible. He referred to a recent increase in smuggling as one reason, but said that the principal reason was that customs and preventive arrangements had to be made at Ras Tanura, and their nature and extent depended paitly on whethei there was an agreement with Koweit or not. 110. In reporting Ibn Sand’s change of policy in regard to Koweit, His Majesty’s Minister mentioned three considerations as being probably the most influential of the motives at work on his mind, viz. (1) The discovery that Ras Tanura was likely to be less advantageous as a port than had seemed probable when the project was still remote. (2) Suspicion of Iraqi designs upon Koweit. j n • (3) A desire to support an Arab fellow-ruler whose position appeared to him to be endangered by the creation of a Koweit council. It is certain that Koweit is the natural port of entry for goods for a large part of Saudi territory, and in maintaining the blockade for so long Ibn baud has perhaps played into the hands of those Iraqis who claim that Koweit is the natural port for Iraq and wish to strengthen economic, if not political, ties with that State. Ill Ibn Saud feels very deeply what seems to him the humiliation inflicted upon the Sheikh of Koweit by the setting up of a council on the wrong lines. When referring to this subject m conversation with Sir R. Bullard at Riyadh he said that it would have been quite correct that the sheikh should appoint a council composed of people of position to advise him. but half the members ot his council were of no importance at all. The Kmg seemed to regard this as dangerous to Arab rulers in general, not merely to the Sheikh of Kowe ^ t - [18903] F * 328 112. A few days before the end of the year information was received from the Political Resident at Bushire that the Sheikh of Koweit had approved the draft trade agreement and the drafts of the two subsidiary agreements, all ot which had been shown to him informally by the political agent. The drafts ot the subsidiary agreements, which were prepared in London, have still to be shown ^ to the Saudi authorities. Frontiers: Relations with Persian Gulf Rulers in general. 113. From Ibn Saud’s point of view, the situation in the Persian Gulf is becoming complicated. He is at last getting a port of his own on the Gulf, but the firm most clearly fitted to act as landing agents for his cargo and that of C.A.S.O.C. is British. Is he to allow this firm to establish itself in his territory at the moment when, as it seems to him, His Majesty s Government aie embarking on a “forward policy” in Arabia—a policy which he probably attributes to the existence of oil along the coast? But it is not only the British who are interested in the Gulf. The Germans are returning, and the Hansa Line seem to have offered to provide landing facilities at Ras 1 anura. Then there is the Iraqi Government, of whose influence Ibn Saud is always suspicious. In this case there is perhaps some ground for suspicion, since it is not disputed that Iraq would like a port in Koweit territory, and that many Iraqis consider that Koweit ought to be incorporated in Iraq. It is partly to Iraq intrigue that Ibn Saud attributes the establishment of a council in Koweit on what he considers quite the wrong lines. It is inevitable that such modernising elements as there may be in the smaller States of the Gulf should look to the nearest Arab neighbour where political and economic development is to be found rather than to Saudi Arabia, whose Government is considered backward and rather absurd. Ibn Saud seems to be conscious that this exposes him to some risk, as was showed by the remarks he made about the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit. (C)— With Powers outside Arabia. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. General. 114. The year began badly with the controversy over the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. The Palestine question, though far more important, seems to grieve Ibn Saud rather than to annoy him, but the frontier question touches his pride and disappoints what he regards as his legitimate hopes. Nevertheless, personal relations remained excellent, reinforced as they were by the Athlone visit. When the Amir Saud needed dental treatment and his brother Muhammad medical attention, it was to London that they went as a matter of course, and their enjoyment of the visit, doctors and dentists notwithstanding, was unmistakable. When Sir R. Bullard went to Riyadh in November Ibn Saud not only received him with his usual hospitable kindness, but showed his respect for His Majesty’s Government by going out several miles one day to visit him m the palace which had been placed at his disposal. 115. Ibn Saud asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Government on many occasions during the year, in particular in connexion with the proposals of the Iraqi Government for financial and other agreements. He gave them early infor mation about the forthcoming withdrawal of the Soviet officials, and consulted them as to the method by which he should define his attitude towards the Anglo-Italian Agreement; and he told them about the arrival of arms supplied by Italy. It is natural to suppose that this confidence does not go all the way; thus no indication of the quantity of arms supplied by Italy was ever given, and Fuad Bey did not volunteer information about the forthcoming appointment of a German Minister. Still, the signs of confidence that were given were welcome, and the advice given in return was probably useful to Ibn Saud, who will, it is hoped, have realised that it was disinterested. In connexion with the suggestion of the Saudi Government that the Sanitary Convention of 1926 should be revised in a sense pleasing to them, an appeal was made for the help of His Majesty’s Government, which is rather embarrassing, since, even if His Majesty’s Govern ment could support the demand whole-heartedly, which is not possible, it is improbable that it can be completely satisfied.29 [18903] f* 4 116. In the matter of Palestine Ibn Sand continued for months to maintain an outward silence, but the authorities in Palestine and Transjordan were convinced that in secret he was supplying or trying to supply arms and ammuni tion to the malcontents in Palestine. Early in June His Majesty’s Minister was ^ impelled by this news to examine the events of the preceding six months, and he found a long list which he put before the Foreign Office as perhaps providing an explanation of the growth of unfriendly feelings towards His Majesty’s Govern ment on the part of Ibn Saud. It was a formidable list, beginning with the unfortunate frontier business; including various circumstances connected with Palestine, such as the intransigent resolution passed in London by the Executive Council of the Zionist Federation and the issue in March of figures of Jewish immigration on a considerable scale for the next six months; and containing two major political events—the annexation of Austria and the signing of the Anglo- Italian Agreement. 117. The section on Palestine shows in detail the attitude of Ibn Saud to His Majesty’s Government on that subject. He seems to have revealed his feelings to the public for the first time in an interview with Mr. Philby in August, but it was the issue of the statement of policy in November which gave him his chance. It enabled him on the one hand to display his influence and to try to convince His Majesty’s Government that he was the one person in the Arab world who matters, and, on the other hand, to appear openly as the champion of the Arab cause. This has a double disadvantage to His Majesty’s Government. If they are unable to give him a reward which he considers adequate he may be dissatisfied; and if the London discussions do not succeed in reaching a solution of the Palestine question that is reasonably satisfactory to the Arabs, Ibn Saud cannot go back on his published words and retreat into that silence which has been of considerable value to us in the past. He has announced that the Amir Faisal, while in London, will bring up matters of mutual interest to the two countries, and the summary of a letter which he is sending to the Prime Minister shows that unrequited affection will be one of the matters to be mentioned. We cannot expect to have as clear a field as we have had for some years. Except for the limited help we have offered in the matter of the Hejaz Railway, there seems to be little we can do to satisfy Ibn Saud’s wishes. It must not be forgotten that the territories in which we are particularly interested hem Ibn Saud in (to use his own expression) in many directions, and that the Germans will not fail to remind him of that galling fact on all occasions. The Athlone Visit. 118. The visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and the Earl of Athlone, which was foreshadowed in paragraph 76 of the 1937 report, took place in February 1938. The visit was a great success, largely owing to the Royal visitors themselves, who, in spite of the exhausting round of hospitalities and a fatiguing journey across the peninsula, made the most pleasing impression on the King and all they met, at the same time as, it is hoped, they enjoyed the novel experience. The Royal party, which included Lord Frederick Cambridge, arrived at Jedda in H.M.S. Enterprise on the 25th February. They were received on the quay by the Amir Faisal—a function which was recorded for posterity by a sound-film taken by Egyptian cinema operators. During their five days’ stay in Jedda they were accommodated as guests of the King at the Kandara Palace, which had been renovated and modernised for the purpose. 119. The functions included a dinner in Jedda and a gargantuan picnic at the Wady Fatma, both given by the Amir Faisal; but the most important were those given by the King, who had come to Jedda to meet the Royal guests. He had never had to entertain a foreign lady before, but his excellent manners carried him with complete success through the perils of afternoon tea and the discomfort of dinner at a table. After the dinner he was persuaded to relate the story of the capture of Riyadh in 1902—a task which he discharged with satisfaction to him self as well as to his audience. 120. The King received Lord Athlone, with His Majesty’s Minister, in private audience. There had been indications that he might refer to the Palestine question, but this had been discouraged, and the conversation avoided that subject. Lord Athlone conveyed a message from His Majesty King George30 which o-ave great pleasure to Ibn Sand, and spoke of the attempts which were beino- made to increase the facilities for Arabic studies at the School of Oriental Studies in London, with which Lord Athlone is connected as Chancellor of London University. 121. Her Royal Highness Princess Alice delayed her departure from Jedda on the 1st March by two hours in order to pay a visit to the King s favourite wife, Umm Mansur, and another of his wives. Heavy rain delayed the caravan the first day, and the party did not reach their camp until long after midnight, but after that the journey, though arduous, was without hardship. At Riyadh the party were entertained by the Amir Sand, who lodged them in the Badia Palace, a summer residence of Ibn Sand which, like the Kandara Palace in Jedda, had been slightly modernised for the occasion. The Amir accompanied them on their journey from Riyadh as far as Rumaihiya, where a shoot was organised. After short stops at Hofuf and at the oil-field, where by a happy coincidence oil had just been struck in commercial quantities, the party said farewell to Saudi territory and crossed to Bahrein. 122. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Mr. Gault accompanied the party on their journey across Arabia. On the way Sheikh Hafiz, under instructions from Ibn Saud which he knew to be unwise, made an appeal to Lord Athlone on the subject of Palestine—and received a diplomatic answer. Saudi-Transjordan Frontier. 123. The survey (paragraph 93 of 1937) has not yet begun. The Saudi Government decided to deal with their frontier with Iraq first, and a joint Saudi- Iraqi survey is now*in progress. The work began at the eastern end, and it is proposed that, when the western extremity of the Saudi-Iraqi frontier is reached, the survey of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier shall begin from that point. Owing to the great heat the work was discontinued for several months in the summer, and it is unlikely that the survey of the Transjordan portion of the frontier will be begun before the autumn of 1939. Meanwhile the terms of reference for a “joint frontier reconnaissance-survey commission” have been drafted by His Majesty’s Government and sent to the Saudi Arabian Government for their consideration. Confidential instructions to the officer-in-charge of the British party on the proposed survey have also been drafted. It was decided that the new A1 Jauf sheet of the 1/1,000,000 International Map, on which the Trans jordan frontier is not shown, should be published and placed on sale, and that it might be communicated to the Saudi Government. Copies were given to Fuad Bey in December. Eastern and South-Eastern Boundary. 124. The controversy on this subject, which was already acute enough, was exacerbated early in 1938 by two unfortunate circumstances : an indiscretion on the part of the Jedda representative of C.A.S.O.C., which revealed to Ibn Saud that His Majesty’s Government had communicated to the company their attitude on the frontier question; and the discovery that Ibn Saud had misread, or been otherwise misled by, a letter sent to Fuad Bey by Mr. Calvert in September 1935. 124a. The Jedda representative of C.A.S.O.C., Mr. Lenahan, was duly informed of the position by His Majesty’s Minister (paragraph 107 of 1937). In a conversation which he had with Fuad Bey shortly afterwards, Mr. Lenahan indiscreetly alluded to this information, whereupon the Saudi Government sent to the legation a protest (10th January) objecting to communications from His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda and from the Foreign Office to representatives of C.A.S.O.C. “ in a manner which might be interpreted as implying the existence of doubts and suspicion as to the attitude of His Majesty.” The companies, the note continued, acted according to the instructions issued to them by the Governments concerned in the territories (in question). The question of the frontiers could only be discussed between the Governments. Fuad Bey supplemented this by informing His Majesty’s Minister that Ibn Saud regarded our direct communi cations to representatives of the C.A.S.O.C. as a personal affront, as implying that he might try to do something underhand which required pressure on the'company from us to prevent—an extravagant misconception which Sir R. Bullard combated with obvious arguments. In April a written reply to the following effect wasconveyed to the Saudi Government. In 1934, when C.A.S.O.C. were beginning operations in Hasa, the United States Government asked His Majesty’s Govern ment for information about the boundaries in those parts. His Majesty s Government furnished the information, and explained carefully, for the informa tion of the company, that the legal frontier in that area was the blue line. The Saudi Government\vere duly informed at the time of this communication to the United States Government. Since then His Majesty’s Government had not informed either the United States Government or the Saudi Government that they no longer regard the blue line as the legal frontier or that they consideied the company free to operate to the east of that line. His Majesty’s Government felt that they would have been justified in protesting to the Saudi Government when they learned that the company, in spite of the information conveyed to the Saudi Government, were operating near Qasr-al-Salwa. On the contrary, out of deference to His Majesty, and in their desire to facilitate matters for him and for the company, they merely informed representatives of the company, quite informally, that, notwithstanding the previous communications to the United States and Saudi Governments, they would raise no objection to the company s operating to the east of the line which His Majesty’s Government still regarded as the legal eastern frontier of Saudi territory, on the understanding that the com pany would not encroach on territory to the east of the extreme limit pi oposed by His'Majesty’s Government to the Saudi Government. His Majesty’s Government had acted in accordance with the practice in cases where important oil companies, whether of the same or of different nationalities, are operating in adjoining areas, and they regretted that the Saudi Government should take exception to a normal procedure designed to ensure the maintenance of good relations between the great oil companies and also between the countries in which they are registered. 125. The second untoward event was more serious. In January, Fuad Bey, in the course of a discussion with His Majesty’s Minister, referred to a letter which Mr. Calvert had written to him on the '28th September, 1935, and asked whether the fourth paragraph did not constitute an assurance. This paragraph reads :— “ The southern limit of the oil concession granted to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company by the Sheikh of Qatar does not extend beyond this ‘ green line,’ but lies to a considerable distance to the north of it. The concession does not, therefore, extend to any territory under discussion with the Saudi Government.” Fuad Bey asked whether the territory now in dispute was not in dispute then, and whether the Saudi Government were not justified in taking this paragraph as an assurance. 126. It would be tedious and unprofitable to develop this point in detail. It was clear that the Saudi Government had read the second sentence, which was copied word for word from the Foreign Office instructions, as meaning that no territory claimed by the Saudi Government had been included in the Qatar con cession, whereas the words ‘ ‘ territory under discussion ’ ’ were intended by His Majesty’s Government to be read in the light of their repeated assertions that they were not prepared to discuss any further abatement of their claims beyond the green line. (It is true that soon after the letter of September 1935 was written His Majesty’s Government did in fact modify the green line slightly in Ibn Sand’s favour, but not in the region relevant to this issue.) It seemed possible at first that Fuad Bey had raked up this point to delay and confuse the issue, but this theory was disposed of by his obvious consternation when His Majesty’s Minister told him what the letter really meant. It is admitted that the letter might have been less ambiguous, and unfortunately it reached the Saudi Government when Fuad Bey was away, so that the officials concerned went by the Arabic text, which contained a mistranslation; a borrowed translator, in the absence of a good Arabic equivalent for “considerable distance,” had written “great distance.” The Saudi Government had no reply to the reminder of His Majesty’s Minister that in all communications from the legation the English is the official text, the Arabic translation being supplied out of courtesy and without guarantee as to its accuracy, but it is to be feared that Ibn Saud was annoyed, and that some suspicion of our good faith remained in his mind.32 127. The Foreign Office were unable to approve the proposal of His Majesty’s Minister (paragraph 109 of 1937) that His Majesty’s Government should accept the Saudi suggestion that both sides should refrain from prospecting in the disputed area for the present, on the ground that this would virtually be conceding the Saudi case. In replying to the Saudi Government, therefore, Sir R. Bullard was obliged to refer to the oral state ment made by Fuad Bey, that “ there was no cause to fear that the company would take action in the disputed territory” (paragraph 108 of 1937 report) and to ignore the Saudi note proposing mutual abstention from operations in that territory. The Saudi Government refused to go beyond their written proposal, but, although they failed to elicit any assurance from His Majesty’s Government, C.A.S.O.C. did not in fact take any action, so far as is known to His Majesty’s Legation, in the area in dispute. 128. In so far as the notes exchanged dealt with the root of the matter, they followed the well-worn track, each party claiming that it alone had shown con ciliation while the other had been quite uncompromising, and setting forth the familiar arguments. Early in March His Majesty’s Minister appealed to Fuad Bey, who was just going on leave, and urged him to make an attempt to get out of the impasse. He suggested that Fuad Bey should give his personal opinion as to the sort of solution which he thought might be acceptable to his Government; Sir R. Bullard would think that opinion over and give his personal views on the possibility of its acceptance by His Majesty’s Government. In this way neither Government would be committed. Fuad took several days “ for reflection,” during which time he no doubt sounded the King. At first he insisted on Jabal Nakhsh, but in the end he put this forward as a solution which might have some hope of acceptance by Ibn Saud : (1) His Majesty’s Government to offer to abandon to Ibn Saud whichever of the two areas, Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, they considered the less important; (2) the frontier to run through Safaq Wells, which should be free of access to the population on both sides. 129. Sir R. Bullard gave Fuad Bey no hint that he thought a compromise possible, and said that any reply he gave would be personal, even to the extent that it would be sent to Fuad Bey when on leave in Syria. He, however, expressed to the Foreign Office the hope that some compromise would be possible and that the only major difficulty other than Palestine might thus be removed. The political resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India put forward strong arguments against any further concession, and these arguments were repeated and reinforced by the India Office in a letter which was sent to the Foreign Office early in May. It was admitted, this letter said, that to retain and promote Ibn Sand’s goodwill towards His Majesty’s Government was very important, but doubtful whether the offer of Khor-el-Odeid would have much effect in this respect, whereas it might prejudice gravely British influence among the protected rulers in the Persian Gulf. In this connexion they quoted the opinion expressed by Sir R. Bullard in March 1937, when he “ doubted whether the transfer would be worth the making, since it would not give Ibn Saud the port he needs, while we should have made a political sacrifice without gaining the advantage which I think we should stand to gain from any improvement in Ibn Sand’s economic position.” The cession of the Khor could not be effected without the consent of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and, as he appeared to be in no danger from Saudi or Wahabi expansion, it would be necessary, it would seem, to offer him monetary compensation, and any attempt to purchase this consent would react unfavourably on British prestige among the Arab sheikhs of the Gulf. Moreover, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi might reasonably expect an assurance that the frontier would be respected, and might accordingly demand a guarantee of protection, as opposed to diplomatic intervention, in the event of violation of his territory. Finally, argued the India Office letter, the traditional objections to admitting Saudi influence to the Trucial Coast and to allowing the chain of protected States to be broken were still of considerable weight; the strategical importance of the air route along the Arab coast of the Gulf seemed to demand that British influence among the local sheikhs should not be weakened; and the increase in the prestige of Ibn Saud at the expense of that of His Majesty’s Government, and the impression which might be created that His Majesty’s Government were afraid of him, would be particularly unfortunate at the present moment, when the sheikhs were in a difficult mood and seemed inclined to flout the wishes of His Majesty’s Government.33 130. On the 1st July the Foreign Office replied to the India Office in a long letter, of which the following is a summary : The European crisis and the deterioration of the situation in Palestine had made it essential to do everything possible to retain the goodwill of Ibn Baud and to strengthen his hand in his dealings with his own people, and to give him access to the Persian Oulf at a new point would be helpful in both directions. The rights of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi extended in theory to the blue line, but His Majesty s Government had had to recognise that he had not asserted his authority farther than the Riyadh line at the utmost. In so far as he had lost his rights, they had lapsed automatically to Ibn Baud as the result of a movement which probably began before the blue line came into being. Recent enquiries on our part had shown that the control of the hinterland by the Trucial sheikhs was not really effective, whereas Saudi officials had been able to penetrate in recent years as far as Baraimi. The only way to check Ibn Baud’s advance was to have a settled frontier, either by fixing one unilaterally or by coming to an agreement with Ibn Baud The second alternative was obviously the best. It could only be secured by ceding to Ibn Baud either Jabal Nakhsh, which was impossible, or the Khor-el-Odeid, which required the acquiescence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The surrender of this small area of empty desert would matter little to the sheikh, whereas that area would be welcome to Ibn Baud both on grounds of prestige and as a possible corridor for an oil pipe-lme. If the sheikh was unable to see the matter in that light, some form of compensation would have to be considered, either in the form of a money payment, or of an assurance of support in the event of a serious attack from the landward side 1 ayment or money was admittedly distasteful, as importing a questionable element into a settlement which could be justified on its merits, but, if it came to a financial arrangement, His Majesty’s Government ought to be prepared to pay £25,000 or even more to secure a settlement. The alternative form of compensation, viz an assurance of protection, would not apply to tribal raids from Saudi Arabia- the undertaking should be so worded as to apply only m the event of a major aggression against Abu Dhabi on the part of the territorial Sovereign on the othCT side of the frontier. The Foreign Office were inclined to think that this would not in practice increase the responsibilities of His Majesty s Government in that area. Our interests in the air route and m ml must prevent our remaining indifferent to any threat to the territories of the Trucial sheikhs, though the Foreign Office agreed that every effort should be made to avoid giving the additional commitment involved in a definite guarantee of any frontier that might be arrived at and to limit our support to a promise to intervene energetically with Ibn Baud or his successors in the event of their disregarding the new frontiers His Majesty’s Government had a right to insist on their point of view since the Trucial sheikhs could not last for a day against Ibn Baud without the protection of His Majesty’s Government. The danger which might result from a diminution in the prestige of His Majesty’s Government m the Gulf was realised but it was not believed that the proposed action would necessarily have that effect. Why should not the advantages of a settled frontier be understood locally ? ‘‘ It might, indeed, be represented to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi that Ibn Baud is the friend of the British and has throughout his career (unlike pertqin lesser Arab rulers of no importance who are ignorant of world affairs) shown himself consistently well-disposed to His Majesty’s Government and anxious in all circumstances to consult their interests; so that His Majesty s Government, for their part, have no hesitation m asking the sheikh to contribute his share towards an agreement which is considered to be advantageous to all parties.” As to the opinion expressed by the Government of India that there were political objections to making a breach m the hue of territory under British control extending from Qatar to Muscat, the Seivice Departments were understood to be satisfied that there were no strategical disadvantages to be apprehended from Saudi access to the Khor-el-Odei . Moreover, a settled frontier would have the effect of setting a limit to Saudi expansion. 130a The India Office, after consulting the Government of India replied to the Foreign Office letter on the 7th October They maintained their determined opposition to the proposal to cede Khor-el-Odeid to Ibn Baud. The Uncial34 sheikhs would think either that we were afraid of Ibn Baud or that we were not scrupulous in observing our undertakings, while the cession would have no serious effect on the attitude of Ibn Baud in the matter of Palestine. Nor would it determine his policy in a great emergency, whereas it was precisely in case of an emergency that our prestige in the Gult would be a matter of great importance. 131. When His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November he was asked by Fuad Bey, who again referred to the great importance of this question in the eyes of Ibn Baud, whether he could give a reply to the suggestion for a settlement which Fuad Bey had made in the spring. In the circumstances, Sir R. Bullard could not give an encouraging reply. Hejaz Railway. 132. Early in January the Saudi Government addressed identic notes to the British and French Legations in Jedda, reminding them that nearly two years had passed since they had communicated with the British and French Govern ments regarding the Haifa Conference and the repair of the railway (paragraph 70 of 1936), and urging that preliminary discussions on the subject should take place. They suggested, as what they called a practical way of getting round the financial difficulty, that the line should be treated as a unit tor the purpose of management and exploitation, as in the case of the International Sleeping-Car Company; in that way it would be easy to obtain money by means of a loan, the issue of shares, subscriptions, or some other method to be agreed upon. 133. In transmitting this communication to the Foreign Office His Majesty’s Minister pointed out that a year before (paragraph 121 of 1937) he had reported adversely on the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps be justified on political grounds in meeting the cost of restoring the damaged portions of the Hejaz Railway, but that since then the situation had changed in two respects : (1) the Saudi Government no longer proposed to have anything to do with the management of the line or with its finances; and (2) the political situation demanded reconsideration. During the past year, said Sir R. Bullard, we had been unable to give any satisfaction about Palestine to Ibn Baud, who had found himself in a position of increasing difficulty. Moreover, we had been very discouraging on another question about which he felt very strongly, viz., the eastern frontier. Again, in the matter of arms and aviation the help we had been able to give or promise compared unfavourably with that given or offered by the Italians. His Majesty’s Government might be well advised to consider whether it would not be worth while to contribute the whole or part of the cost of restoring the damaged part of the line as a political gesture to Ibn Baud without reference to its reception in the Moslem world. 134. Shortly afterwards the Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed His Majesty’s Minister that the Syrian Minister of Finance had discussed the Hejaz Railway while on the pilgrimage and promised to urge those concerned to authorise a contribution of £30,000 sterling from Syrian revenues towards the reconstruction of the damaged portion, and that Ibn Baud had promised to contribute a similar amount. Sir R. Bullard reported this information to the Foreign Office, saying that if we could agree to reopen discussion it would make a good impression, and that the fact that Syria and Saudi Arabia proposed to contribute towards the cost of repair both made it more difficult for us to refuse and at the same time reduced the financial call upon us. It may be stated here that although there existed for some time doubts whether Syria would, in fact, contribute £30,000 or, indeed, anything, His Majesty’s Minister was officially informed in October that the Syrian Government had paid into a bank the sum of £10,000 as the first third of their promised contribution. 135. In June the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed a note to His Majesty’s Minister reporting a unanimous decision by the Syrian Chamber to open the promised credit for the repair of the Hejaz Railway, and asking two questions : were the British Government prepared to pay any monetary compensa tion as a contribution for the repair of the line, regard being had to the fact that the destruction was effected by the Allies during the Great War and in their military interests? and (2) did His Majesty’s Government agree to the holding35 of a conference in Jedda, to be attended by representatives of Great Britain, France, Syria and Saudi Arabia, on the understanding that the Saudi Government maintained their former views as to the ownership of the line? the ioreign Office, who not only had to consult the various departments concerned m Whitehall but also to ascertain that the French had no objection to the attitude they wished to adopt, authorised His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, in October,to send the Saudi Government a reply to the following effect: His Majesty s Government agreed to the proposal that representatives of the four countries concerned should meet at Jedda with the object of reaching an agreement as to the repair of the Hejaz Railway, on the understanding that His Majesty’s Government, like the Saudi Arabian Government, maintained their former views as to the ownership oi the line. His Majesty’s Government intended (this in strict confidence) to authorise their representatives at the conference to announce that they were prepaied to repair at their own expense the Mudawwara—Maan section (in iiansjoidan) o the railway, and to contribute £30,000 sterling towards the reconstruction ot the Saudi section provided that the Saudi Government could raise from other sources the remainder of the estimated cost of restoring the section lying within then- territory. According to estimates which had been made, the repair or the Mudawwara-Maan section alone would involve His Majesty’s Government m expenditure which might extend to £100,000. In making this offer His Majesty s Government felt bound to say that they felt considerable doubt whether the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway could be regarded as economically sound, and they felt obliged to make the reservation that while they were prepared to offer the sums mentioned towards the reconstruction ot those sections of the railway which were not in working order, they would be unable to make any further contribution even if the working of the Saudi Arabian section should result in a loss to the Saudi Government Their doubt whether the railway would be self-supporting arose from their belief that the cost ot reconstructing the Saudi section would be greater than the Saudi Government had suggested and might be as much as £300,000. ami from their hesitation to believe that the number of pilgrims and passengers who would use the line and the freight likely to be carried, would even cover the current cost ot working, let alone the amortisation of the capital sunk in the reconstruction If, however notwithstanding these difficulties, the Saudi Arabian Government still considered it necessary or desirable to proceed with the reconstruction of the pmtion o e line lying within their territory, His Majesty’s Government would, subject to the conditions they had laid down, assist to the extent of the sums mentioned, m the initial work of reconstruction. 136. His Majesty’s Minister sent in a note on these lines, and told his French colleague, in confidence, what he had done. M. Maigret had received no fnstmetions on the subject. The Saudi Government replied very promp ly, expressing their gratitude and saying that they had had no reply from the Frelich Government, but would like the conference to meet on the 11th January They suggested that economic obstacles could be discussed at the conference and supported a proposal made by the Syrian Government that an estimate of the costof repair should be made by British and French engineers. Did His Majesty s Government approve this proposal, and did they think that the estimate sbou d be made before or after the conference? When forwarding this reply to the Foreign Office Sir R. Bullard commended the proposal for an Anglo-French survey as sensible and suggested that the survey ought to be carried out before the conference. The date proposed for the conference was early but Ibn baud s object was doubtless to try to secure a decision before the pilgrimage, and as that would mean much to'him Sir R. Bullard hoped that endeavours would be made to fall in with the Saudi proposal. His Majesty s Government accepted inf principle the invitation to a conference to open in Jedda on the 11th January but’said that owing to the demands on the railway staff in Palestine on account of damage resulting from the disturbances it was unlikely that a survey could be made before the conference or that an expert could be sent to Jedda to assist His Majesty’s Minister, who would represent His Majesty s Government. They added that a recent estimate of the cost of the repair of the whole me from Maan to Medina was £200,000 and suggested that this figure might be used as a working basis if the conference should be held.36 137. At the end of November the Foreign Office, after correspondence with the Colonial Office, sent to Sir R. Bullard comprehensive instructions, in which the chief points were these :— (1) Financial assistance should not be offered in the name of Transjordan. (2) His Majesty’s Government held to their attitude of inability to accept the contention that the line was an indivisible whole to be both owned and controlled by the Moslem Advisory Council to be set up under the Bompard Declaration (of January 1923), though this did not mean that they could refuse to agree to the establishment of an advisory council of Moslem representatives to make recommendations for the upkeep of the line and the improvement of traffic conditions for pilgrims. (3) If the Saudi representatives at the proposed conference should show any disposition to pursue the question of the joint administration of the various sections of the railway, an endeavour should be made to induce them to abandon this sterile subject and to concentrate on the task of reconstruction. (4) The services of the Palestine Railways administration should be offered to, and, indeed, pressed upon the Saudi representatives for the purpose of the reconstruction, but not, at any rate for the present, for the operation of the Saudi section. (5) A suitable opportunity should be taken to repeat the warning, that although His Majesty’s Government were anxious, out of regard for Ibn Saud, to assist him within the limits of their ability in this matter, they feared that the fulfilment of the project might be a disappointment to him (6) His Majesty’s Government could not make their financial contribution towards the cost of repairing the Saudi section, or begin the recon struction of the Maan-Mudawwara section, until the whole of the money necessary for the Saudi section has been provided. 138. The last paper in the year is a note which was sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain the discrepancy between the various estimates of the cost of the work which had been communicated to them : the higher figure represented what it would cost to bring the line up to the pre-war standard, the lower, the cost of the absolute minimum of repairs essential to permit the operation of a train service. 139. The French Government had not replied to the invitation by the end of the year, and it seemed unlikely that the conference could be held in January 1939. Pecuniary Claims. 140. The situation remains as described in paragraph 125 of the report for 1937. Oil Interests. 141. The prospects of the Red Sea oil concession seem to be poor. Core drilling has continued in the Farsan Islands and has been begun near Jizan, but with no success so far. 142. In 1937 th* Saudi Government appealed to His Majesty’s Government to assist them in escaping from what seemed to them a deadlock over the Saudi rights in oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone. At a moment of great financial stress Ibn Saud had given C.A.S.O.C. an option on his half of the oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone for a nominal sum, and he feared that they would do nothing because it was to their interest that that oil should not be developed. Investiga tion in London eventually showed that the option which C.A.S.O.C. had acquired covered not only half the oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone but all the oil in Saudi Arabia proper that was not already covered by the concessions granted to C.A.S.O.C. and to the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited). The terms of the option require that if any other company should make an offer for37 the rights which it covers, C.A.S.O.C. must either pay as much as that offer or renounce the option. The Iraq Petroleum Company made an offer of £100,000, and this offer had not been capped by C.A.S.O.C. by the end of the year. 143. The Shell Company, who until recently supplied most of the petrol required in the Hejaz and even had a contract with the Saudi authorities, seem likely to be squeezed out by C.A.S.O.C., who, under pressure from the Saudi Government, are bringing petrol to Jedda at prices which seem to be uneconomic. Shifting Interests on the Hasa Coast. 144. The opening up of Has Tanura, on the Persian Gulf, as a port, raised the question of landing facilities. At present C.A.S.O.C. are large importers, and as most of their imports consist of large and heavy machinery and plant they require skilled people to handle it. They would like to employ at Ras Tanura the firm they have always used in Bahrein, the long-established British firm of Gray, MacKenzie and Co., but hitherto no foreigners except the Americans at the oil-field had been allowed to work on the Persian Gulf side of Saudi Arabia, and the issue had a political side to it in that the British are identified in Ibn Saud’s mind with the policy which, be considers, has hitherto sacrificed the development of his country to Bahrein and Koweit. The concession was coveted by the Saudi family of Qusaibi, who represent the King at Bahrein, and they are believed to have used the political bogy to discredit Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie and Co. in the King’s eyes, and there is confidential evidence to show that Ibn Saud was rather unwilling to let the British get a commercial footing on the Hasa coast. Perhaps a bid made by the German Hansa Line for rights of some kind at Ras Tanura afforded an additional complication. What Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie and Co. wanted was a ten-year contract for the landing of all cargo consigned to the Saudi Government—a matter of some 60,000 packages a year : they already had a promise from C.A.S.O.C. that they would be employed for all the C.A.S.O.C. work for that period, provided they received official permis sion to work on the mainland. What the Saudi Government want above all things is regular calls by the British India mail steamers so that they may be just like Bahrein, though at first they made many other demands too. Such calls, even if only once a fortnight, would mean a readjustment of the time-table of the mail steamers in the Gulf and would require the assent of the Govern ment of India. The negotiations set on foot to this end were still in progress at the end of the year, and Mr. Wills, of Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie and Co., who had come to Jedda in mid-November to discuss the Ras Tanura business with the Saudi authorities, was still in Jedda awaiting a decision. Survey of the Persian Gulf. 145. In October His Majesty’s Minister learned from the Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Station, that H.M.S. Challenger proposed to resume survey operations in the Persian Gulf about the middle of November, proceeding from west of Bahrein to Ras Tanura and then southwards into Duhat-al-Salwa, and that this would involve landing on the coast to set up marks, make observations, and so on. Sir R. Bullard wrote to the Saudi Government, inviting their co-operation whenever it should be required, sent a letter to the commander- in chief with a warning about the necessity for discretion in view of the frontier negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government in those parts, and suggested to the Foreign Office as a practical measure that the assistance of the local authorities should be invoked between the blue line and a point east of Qasr-al-Salwa, but not on the coast of what is still “ disputed territory.” This proposal was approved by the Foreign Office. The Saudi Government agreed to co-operate, but asked that H.M.S. Challenger should apply to the local authorities whenever it was desired to go on shore that they might appoint someone to be present. Sir R. Bullard suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that as it would be difficult for the vessel to get into touch with the local authorities at every place, it would be best that a Saudi official should be detailed from some well-known administrative centre such as Uqair, to accompany the ship when she should be working in or near Saudi waters and to act as a go-between with the local authorities in case of need. The Saudi Government approved this plan and set to work to find guides, who, how ever, were not required by the end of the year.38 146. H.M.S. Challenger fixed the points for the buoying of the Ras Tanura anchorages and approaches—a service which the Saudi Government seem to have appreciated. Aeroplane Flights across Saudi Territory. 147. In March instructions were received from the Foreign Office to apply for the permission of the Saudi Government for the passage across Saudi territory in April of three Royal Air Force aircraft of the “ Wellesley type, which were to make an experimental flight from Egypt to Australia : the route across Saudi Arabia was to be from a point on the Transjordan frontier near Mann to a point on the Persian Gulf midway between Koweit and Bahrein, and would bring the machines within approximately 150 miles of Hail. After permission had been obtained, the flight w T as postponed until October, but a practice non stop flight from England to the Persian Gulf across Saudi Arabia was arranged for a date in July between the 7th July and the 15th July, and it was contemplated that the machines, after visiting Australia, should return by the same route. The Saudi Government gave permission for this practice flight, which presumably took place, as the Saudi authorities made enquiries about “an aeroplane” which was seen over their territory on the 8th July, more or less on the line which had been indicated. The long-distance flight was carried out in November, when three ‘ ‘ Wellesley ” bombers broke the long-distance record and two made a direct flight from Egypt to Australia. The Saudi Government gave permission for this flight also, but their Minister in London called at the Foreign Office, on instructions from Ibn Saud, and said that His Majesty’s Government would avoid placing him in an embarrassing situation if they were to make requests for permission for flights on very rare occasions only. The minister explained that Ibn Saud had no personal objection and, indeed, was glad to help His Majesty’s Government, but some of his ignorant and suspicious tribesmen regarded the passage of aircraft as a sign that he had sold his country to the British, and though he had no sympathy with such views he was obliged to take them intoaccount. On instructions from His Majesty’s Government, Sir R. Bullard informed the King that they would bear his wishes in mind in future. The British Council. 148. This is the first occasion on which this heading has been required in the Jedda annual report. In May the legation received from Lord Lloyd through the Foreign Office an enquiry as to the possibility of extending the work of the British Council to Saudi Arabia. The letter mentioned two specific projects which had occurred to Lord Lloyd during his recent tour in the Near and Middle East, viz., to provide a medical unit, including a British doctor, which, subject to religious and political considerations, would reside at Ibn Saud’s headquarters wherever it might happen to be at the moment; and secondly, to assist an Englishman with experience of teaching in Iraq who wished to set up as a teacher of English in Saudi Arabia. As an alternative to the first proposal, it was suggested that some other form of medical work, e.g., among women, might be possible. 149. Discreet soundings discovered reluctance on Ibn Saud’s part to accept an English teacher in his country, ostensibly because of its religious character, and after careful consideration His Majesty's Minister was compelled to declare against the medical proposals also for the moment, partly on religious grounds, partly because of the hostility which such proposals would meet from the Syrians who at present monopolise the medical posts in Saudi Arabia. The Governor of Jedda, to whom the work of the British Council had been explained, suggested (under inspiration from above) that the only possibility seemed to be to offer education in England to selected young men. Working on these lines Sir R. Bullard suggested that one young Saudi wffio had done well at a secondary school in Egypt should be assisted to take a course at an English university in history and connected subjects, and that two Saudi pilots should take courses in naviga tion, with the help of the Council, at some civil aviation school in the United Kingdom. Both of these suggestions were approved by the Council. The history student could not accept the offer for 1938, but hopes to do so for the autumn of 1939. Sir R. Bullard had not put the other proposal before the Saudi authorities because he found that they had made no attempt to take advantage of the facilities offered them for the training of Saudi mechanics in Egypt free of cost.39 150. Another project which occurred to Sir R. Bullard was approved by Lord Lloyd in principle, viz., the provision of a British expert to study the cause and prevention of the malaria which has wrecked so many of the colonies established by Ibn Saud in Hasa. It is thought that this would meet with less hostility from the Syrians than ordinary medical work. On the other hand, Ibn Saud might not like to have a British doctor wandering about in Hasa, and the proposal would have to be made at a very favourable moment. It is hoped that such a moment may be found in 1939. Arabic Broadcasts from London. 151. There is no doubt that these broadcasts, which were inaugurated by an impressive ceremony of the 3rd January, have established themselves as giving as fair a version of world affairs as can be expected, and a much more truthful one than those supplied by Italy and Germany. It is unfortunate that they began on the day when the B.B.C., in accordance with their sound policy of not concealing the truth, had to announce the hanging of a Palestinian for complicity in the rebellion, as Ibn Saud, who had refrained from listening to the Arabic broadcasts from Jerusalem and other stations for some months because of their references to Palestine, not only listened to the inaugurating broadcast from London himself, but had crowded his tent with Arabs to listen with him. Owing to the absence of newspapers with news in them and to other facilities for getting items of information, it is difficult for the legation to supply London (and Jerusalem) with items for their broadcasts, but there is reason to believe that what interests the listener here is information about world politics, though an occasional item about local affairs flatters his vanity. Unless and until the Palestine question is settled on a basis reasonably satisfactory to the Arabs, it is not to be expected that the Arabic broadcasts from London will make much headway against the natural prejudice which our present policy creates in Arab minds, but if that is done the broadcasts ought to be a valuable factor in helping to maintain good relations between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. Other British Governments. A ustralia. 152. The Australian Trade Commissioner in Egypt, whose title was changed during the year to the Australian Government Commissioner, includes Saudi Arabia within his jurisdiction. This fact was made known officially to the Saudi Government. Canada. 153. Although no official notification to that effect has been received, His Majesty’s Legation conclude from commercial enquiries addressed to them by the Canadian Trade Commissioner in Egypt that Saudi Arabia is included in his jurisdiction. India. 154. The relations between Saudi Arabia and India are confined mainly to the pilgrimage, which is dealt with in a separate section, but there is one other matter of common interest, viz., the conclusion of an agreement for the mutual service of summonses. The negotiations, which have been going on for over a year, are not yet concluded, but they appear to be drawing to an end. 155. In December the legation were informed of the appointment of an Indian Government Trade Commissioner at Alexandria with jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia among other Near Eastern countries. France and Syria. 156. The French Government presented to Ibn Saud in April a second Caudron-Renault monoplane (paragraph 141 of 1937). Apart from that the relations between the two Governments were probably confined to matters affecting Syria, in particular the Hejaz Railway and the Sanjak of Alexandretta. The French seem to have been unhelpful in the matter of the Hejaz Railway. It is true that they considered that it was not for the Syrian authorities to decide40 whether to contribute to the repair of the railway or not, but this does not account for their failure to send any reply to the invitation of the Saudi Government to take part in a conference on the subject in January 1939. 157. Rumours which had been referred to in the Syrian press, that during his visit to Mecca for the pilgrimage the Syrian Minister of Finance would confer with Ibn Sand as to the possible adhesion of Syria to the Saudi-Iraqi-Yemeni Treaty of Brotherhood and Alliance, were disposed of by Fuad Bey, who informed His Majesty’s Minister that this was at present impossible, as France was in charge of Syria’s foreign affairs. He added, however, that there was a plan to attach to the French Legation in Jedda a Syrian Consul who would eventually split oft’ and be independent. 158. Syrians are more prominent than popular in the Hejaz. Nearly all the doctors are Syrians, and no one seems to consider them either competent or honest; while Najib Salha, who as the Jedda representative of the Ministry of Finance is almost openly lining his pockets, is the object of particular dislike. These “ foreigners,” as the Hejazis call them, do little to cement the unity of the Arab world. Italy. 159. Mr. Eden’s resignation at the end of February was made the subject of a communication to the Saudi Arabian Government, in which they were assured that that resignation showed no change of policy, and that, although conversations with Italy were about to begin, His Majesty’s Government had in mind their particular position in regard to Saudi Arabia, and the interests of that country. This elicited an urgent reply, in which the Saudi Arabian Government enquired whether the Rome Understanding of 1927 would be discussed, and whether His Majesty’s Government would “ persist in respecting it.” They were reassured on that point. The Imam Yahya of the Yemen endeavoured to persuade King Ibn Sand to urge that the subject of Palestine should be discussed during the Anglo-Italian conversations, but the King took no action of this sort. 160. On instructions, His Majesty’s Minister forwarded to the Saudi Arabian Government, on the 12th April, a memorandum showing the provisions concerning Arabia which were likely to result from the Anglo-Italian conversa tions then proceeding. Five days later he explained the proposals of His Majesty’s Government concerning the proper action to be taken at Geneva in order to clear up the anomalous situation arising out of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia. A reply to the former communication merely expressed gratitude and hopes for the future; and a similar reply to the second communication expressed pleasure at anything tending to bring about good relations and an understanding between the two negotiating parties. 161. The Saudi Arabian Government soon supplemented these general observations with questions concerning the interpretation of certain parts of the agreement. They addressed a note to the legation on the 27th April asking the precise meaning of article 3 and article 5 (2) of the annex, which said that it was to the common interest of the two parties that no other Power should obtain sovereignty or a privileged position in this country, particularly on the coast of the Red Sea, or in the Yemen; and that it was to the common interest of both parties that no Power should intervene in any conflict which might break out between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. To this His Majesty’s Minister answered that the object was to prevent interference or encroachment by any foreign Power whatsoever. It was supposed that the reason why the Saudi Arabian Government showed anxiety was because certain Syrian newspapers had represented these clauses as implying an Anglo-Italian protectorate. 162. Meanwhile, on the 3rd May, the Iraqi Government had handed in a long document defining their attitude to the agreement in some detail. They put a number of questions to His Majesty’s Government concerning the effect of the agreement on the special relations established between Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen by the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance of April 1936, to which the Yemen had signified her agreement in 1937. This Iraqi protest does not seem to have been drawn up in co-operation with the Other two members of41 the Arab alliance, and King Ihn Sand seems at first to have taken the view that “ that’s the sort of thing the Iraqis would do but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who was in Bagdad at the time, probably thought otherwise and excited his Sovereign’s suspicions. The long protest mentioned below, which the Saudi Arabian Government subsequently addressed to this legation, showed that the King’s chief fears were for his independence and liberty of action. There was no suggestion on his part of any closer approach to Iraq, and it is safe to say that the prospect of a political union with Iraq would fill the King with annoyance and apprehension. 163. The considered observations of the Saudi Arabian Government on the agreement were handed in to the legation on the 19th June. There was a covering letter, which started by saying that the perusal of the full text of the agreement revealed provisions touching the independence of Saudi Arabia. Being confident that His Majesty s Government only accepted such provisions in order to pin down Italy to non-interference in Arabia, they proposed to send His Majesty’s Government and to Italy identic notes, drafts^ of which were attached. 164. I he draft notes said that the Saudi Arabian Government were not affected by an instrument which they had not signed. The Saudi Government asked the meaning of the words c ‘ common interest ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ privileged position of a political character,” particularly with reference to the treaty with Iraq and the Yemen. They suggested that article 3 was incompatible with the first article of the Treaty of Jedda, and asked whether article 8 placed a time-limit on our recognition of Saudi Arabia’s independence. The Saudi Arabian Govern ment proposed to send in the identic notes after receipt of the reply of His Majesty’s Government. It is to be noted that these communications did not make so much of the Brotherhood Treaty as the Iraqi note did; nor was there any mention of an Iraq military mission, or of the economic proposals made by Iraq for a combined currency and a clearing agreement with Japan. Ibn Saud also made the ingenious suggestion that his proposed notes would help His Majesty’s Government by “ inducing the Italian Government to agree with them in interpreting the provisions of the agreement in such a way as to remove the ambiguity which it contains and which appears to destroy or limit our independence.” Shortly after the receipt of this communication a private enquiry was received from the King asking whether His Majesty’s Government proposed to withhold recognition of the Italian conquest' of Abyssinia permanently or only temporarily. 165. The proposal to send identic notes, which might involve the concoction of identic replies with the Italian Government, caused His Majesty’s Govern ment some apprehension. An interim reply was sent to the King saying that he could rest assured that nothing in the agreement placed any time-limit on the recognition of the independence and integrity of Saudi Arabia. As for the recognition of Abyssinia, a reply was sent to the effect that His Majesty’s Government intended to grant de jure recognition when the agreement came into force, which meant not before some settlement of the Spanish problem had been reached. Finally, a long and reasoned reply to the points raised by the King’s notes was sent m on the 18th July. This reply set forth in detail the meanino- of the words “common interest ” and “privileged position of a political character”; stated that His Majesty’s Government did not regard the Brotherhood Treaty as contrary to such'“ common interest ”; denied that there was any conflict with the Treaty of Jedda; reaffirmed that no time-limit was set on the recognition of Saudi Arabia’s independence; agreed that the Saudi Arabian Government was not bound by an agreement to which they were not parties; and, in general, maintained that the object of the agreement was the maintenance of the integrity and the independence of Saudi Arabia. 166. It was hoped for some months that this replv had been found convincing by Ibn Saud, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin began all over again when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November, and showed him a draft note characteristically full of hypothetical questions. The discussions were continued later m the year in Jedda, with Fuad Bey, who was inclined to accept the view that, if the Saudi Arabian Government were determined to address communications to the British and Italian Governments, thev should confine themselves to principles and should not ask any questions first. ^42 167. Having been informed by His Majesty’s Government in confidence that they proposed to ratify the Anglo-Italian Agreement and to recognise the Italian conquest of Ethiopia about the middle of November, Ibn Saud asked foi advice as to his own attitude. His hand was forced, however, by the premature announce ment of His Majesty’s Government’s intentions in the Italian wireless broadcasts, and he sent a message to the Italian Minister in Jedda, who had raised the subject again, that Saudi Arabia was prepared to recognise the conquest of Ethiopia. When the birthday of the King of Italy arrived a day or two later, the Saudi telegram of congratulation was addressed to the King of Italy and Emperor of Ethiopia. 168. The Italian offer of arms (paragraph 134 of 1937) ended in the arrival in March of some guns and some cases containing other war material. Fuad Bey brought to His Majesty’s Minister a message from Ibn Saud, to say that he had been obliged to accept some arms from Italy but that no material advantage would ever affect his friendship for His Majesty’s Government, but he was rather vague —studiously vague it seemed to Sir R. Bullard—about the nature of the consign ment. He described them as specimens and said that if they were satisfactory, orders might be passed. The legation never heard what the financial terms of the transaction were. 169. The Italian air mission is still in Jedda, getting little professional satisfaction out of its duties (see Aviation Section, paragraph 229). 170. At the reception for Saudi officials and notables which was held at the Italian Legation on the 11th November the guests were treated to a special broadcast from Bari telling them about the passionate interest which the Italian Government take in the Mecca pilgrimage. They do in fact bring subsidised pilgrims to the Hejaz, and the shipping and currency difficulties do give them a great deal of trouble. For the 1938 pilgrimage they provided a military transport fitted to carry 1,500 pilgrims, and it brought about 660 from Mogadiscio and went back to Massawwa for some 560 more—a total considerably smaller than that of the Italian pilgrims from East Africa, who, according to Italian figures, were brought under State auspices the year before. Hostels for Italian pilgrims have been established in Mecca and Medina. A Tripolitanian who had been inter preter to the Italian Legation for many years was appointed as manager of the Mecca hostel. The appointment was obviously political, but the Saudi circular designed to check foreign propaganda (paragraph 16) will have hampered his activities. 171. The alleged violation of Saudi territorial waters by a cruiser, and of Saudi territory by two aeroplanes, all of which are believed to have been Italian, is mentioned in paragraph 11. Germany. 172. It is several years since Germany was mentioned in the annual report from this post. But it was too much to hope that Germany would not sooner or later fish in the troubled waters of Palestine. The reports about orders for arms placed in Germany by Palestinian extremists could not perhaps be substantiated in full, but in November, when the harsh measures against German Jews were the subject of strong criticism in Great Britain, the Germans came out into the open with violent anti-British propaganda on the subject of Palestine. The first German broadcasts on the subject were made when His Majesty’s Minister was in Riyadh, and Ibn Saud warned him of the danger, which he said was only just beginning. The Arabs did not trust the Germans and the Italians, he declared, but desperate men would accept help from any quarter. At another interview he reaffirmed his friendship for His Majesty’s Government in spite of approaches “ from other countries.” It was about this time that news was received from His Majesty’s Embassy in Bagdad, that Ibn Saud had concurred in a Syrian suggestion that the German Minister in Bagdad should be accredited to Saudi Arabia also, and divide his time between the two posts. This news was confirmed late in December by Fuad Bey, who told His Majesty’s Minister that Dr. Grobba, the German Minister at Bagdad, was coming to jedda for the pilgrim season, and that he had wanted to make an experimental flight direct from Bagdad to Jedda—a request which had been refused by the Saudi Government.173. The first steamer to call at the new Saudi port of Ras Tanura, on the coast of Hasa, was the steamship Gierfels, of the German Hansa Line. This line applied to C.A.S.O.C. for the work of landing agents at Ras Tanura, but it seems to have received no encouragement. On the Red Sea side of Arabia there is not much German trade, though the Hansa Line call at Jedda regularly. Two German citizens are now living in Jedda, a Mr. Hall and his wife. Mi\ Hall is a member of a well-known family, half-German, half-Abyssinian, long established in Addis Ababa, which has been squeezed out since the Italian conquest. Turkey. 174. The solution of the Alexandretta problem which was eventually adopted by France and Turkey will have served to strengthen the suspicions of Turkish policy towards the Arabs which Ibn Saud has expressed to His Majesty’s Government on so many occasions. He has shown little outward interest in the subject this year, but his views probably differ little if at all from those of the Kaimakam of Jedda, who considers that the sanjak has been sold to the Turks by the French in exchange for security for the rest of Syria and for the recognition of the special position of France therein. 175. In June the Ministry for Foreign Affairs showed to His Majesty’s Minister copies of telegrams exchanged between the Turkish Charge d’Affaires and Ibn Saud. M. Goren, acting on instructions from Angora, telegraphed to the King urging him not to be misled by the rumours and slanders about 'turkey that were being uttered : the trouble in the sanjak was mainly due to certain Catholics acting apparently under the protection of the French High Commissioner with the Pope in the background. Turkey, said M. Goren, adhered firmly to her desire for the freedom and independence of the Arabs and for the establishment of a lasting friendship between Arabs and Turks, and His Majesty must therefore be on the watch for anything that interested parties might do to disturb that friendship. In his reply Ibn Saud reciprocated the good wishes of the Turkish Government, said that he had advised the Syrian Prime Minister in 1937 to act with moderation and had informed His Majesty’s Government of that fact, and expressed the hope that a satisfactory settlement would be arrived at. Being asked for his views on this correspondence by the representative of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs who had read the telegrams to him, Sir R. Bullard, refraining with some difficulty from the comment that the Turks obviously thought more highly of Ibn Saud’s influence than of his intelligence, merely said that some compromise seemed inevitable in the circumstances and spoke with high appreciation of the counsel of moderation which His Majesty had given to Jamil Mardom. 176. In reporting to His Majesty’s Government the gist of the above- mentioned telegrams, His Majesty’s Minister reminded them that Ibn Saud used to believe, or affect to believe, that His Majesty’s Government were strangely blind to the Turkish peril, but that by now he might perhaps have come to the conclu sion that they had helped to sacrifice the Arabs in the sanjak to the Turks in return for Turkish friendship and support; he might even connect their attitude with the advice which the Turkish Foreign Minister had recently given the Palestine Arabs, to accept the partition policy of His Majesty’s Government, Sir R. Bullard said that if Ibn Saud could see the minutes of the proceedings at which the sanjak question had been discussed, he might take a more favourable view of British policy, but with the information at his disposal he would inevitably believe that from fear or self-interest we had allowed the Turks to attain in the sanjak a political predominance which was not justified by the strength of the Turkish element in the population. 177. The Foreign Office sent to Jedda a copy of a telegram sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad, setting forth’the point of view of His Majesty’s Government on the subject of the sanjak. This telegram, they considered, would furnish His Majesty’s Legation with the necessary background for a reply to any further enquiries from Ibn Saud on the subject, and to refute any suggestion that His Majesty’s Government, in order to obtain Turkish friend ship and support, had used their influence with the French Government to induce them to accede to Turkish demands regarding the sanjak without regard for the interests of the local Arabs.44 178. The matter was, in fact, never raised again in Jedda, but in July the Saudi Legation in London informed the Foreign Office that the Saudi Govern ment had been approached by the Iraq Government regarding the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and would like' to know the views of His Majesty’s Government on the suggestion of the Iraq Government that the sanjak should be partitioned. The Saudi Government had not, as yet, he said, agreed to the Iraqi suggestion that they should associate themselves'with representations to the French Govern ment on the subject. Mr. Zada was informed that the Iraq Government had recently requested His Majesty’s Government to approach the Turkish Govern ment regarding the partition of the sanjak. It was explained to him that His Majesty’s Government did not think the solution reached by agreement between the French and Turkish Governments was an ideal solution, but the question was whether any better solution was possible. In principle, His Majesty’s Govern ment welcomed the fact that an agreement had been reached between the two parties directly concerned, and would be reluctant to do anything which would revive former differences. In any case, His Majesty’s Government did not think that anything that they could say would induce the Turkish Government to_ agree to partition without the acquisition of Antioch. Moreover, His Majesty s Government were not at all sure that partition would be a good solution, and the Geneva settlement certainly seemed to possess some advantages, for example, demilitarisation, from the point of view of Syria and Iraq. 179. The King voiced his suspicions of Turkey once more when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November. He referred to the Turkish ‘ ‘ finger ” as one of the three at work in Palestine, the other two being the Italian and the German. According to him the Turks were jeering at the Palestine Arabs for having exchanged Turkish domination for that of the Jews, and this was having considerable effect on many Arabs. He repeated his prophecy that sooner or* later the Turks would try to recover Mosul, and he now added the Jazira to the list of their objectives. 180. Ibn Sand did not send a special representative to Angora to the funeral of President Ataturk, but asked the Iraq Government to let their representative act as his envoy also. Egypt. 181. Although the Egyptian Government appointed a Minister to Saudi Arabia in 19:^6, it was not until December 1938 that the Minister, Abdul Rnhman Azzam, joined his post and presented his credentials. It is expected that the Minister, who is accredited to the Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan Governments also, will spend most of the year at his other posts. 182. As had been foreshadowed in the Egyptian press in 1937, the Kiswa procedure was cut down still further for the 1938 pilgrimage. The Kiswa was handed over at Mecca with some ceremony, which was reported in the Mecca press, but the Mahmal remained at Suez. 183. The Banque Misr are credited with large schemes for economic develop ment in Saudi Arabia, but little has come of them up to the present moment. It is believed that even their financial importance in Jedda has diminished owing to the provision of better terms to the Government by the Netherlands Trading Society. The banque brought a dredger to work on the boat channel in Jedda harbour, but although apparently no charge was made for its services, it remained idle for a considerable time, owing to a dispute about payment of dues—or, as some people alleged, because the Saudi Government were frightened by a theory that the work accomplished by the dredger would make Jedda easier of access for foreign warships. 184. The useful scheme in which the Egyptian Government are interested, to construct proper roads from Jedda to Mecca and Arafat and from Jedda to Medina, and to provide Mecca with water and electric light, had not been put into execution by the end of the year, though it is believed that the two Govern ments had at last come to an agreement on the main points at issue. The scheme seems to be generous to the Saudi Government. It is to cost in all about £E. 240,000. Of this the Egyptian Waqfs would advance £100,000, as representing one-half the money due to the poor of the Holy Cities for four years,45 while the Egyptian Government would advance the larger portion of the cost and recover it without interest from the proceeds of the Saudi Government Road Tax on pilgrims. It seems that the Saudi Government wished the work to be under the supervision of a Saudi committee chosen for piety rather than for technical or administrative knowledge, and on this question of control the negotiations remained at a deadlock for months. 185. 1 he fact is that the points of view of the two Governments differ widely. The Egyptians wish to assist Saudi Arabia to make the Hej az more tolerable for pilgrims, but expect to have their superior knowledge and skill in such things recognised, while the Saudi Government, though greedy for financial help, are very touchy as to anything that seems to affect their independence. The Banque Misr aroused suspicion by desiring to have a finger in every pie, and this suspicion was increased when (if Fuad Bey is to be credited) they wished to fly the Egyptian flag over all their buildings, even on their hotel in Jedda. It is certain that the Egyptian takya in Mecca was flying the Egyptian flag. To put an end to this the Saudi Government promulgated in March a regulation restric ting the flying of the national flags to foreign missions and consulates, except on festive occasions, when the local flag must be flown as w r ell. 186. As in the parallel case of Iraq, the acquisition of independence by Egypt has not brought unmixed satisfaction to Ibn Saud. Early in the year Sheikh Yusuf Yasin asked His Majesty’s Minister about the possible effect of the Egyptianisation ’ of the International Quarantine Board, and remarked that a purely Egyptian board might be more severe on Saudi Arabia than the existing body. Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia all want to be considered the leader of the Arab world, and Ibn Saud watches with jealous eyes to see that neither of the other two steals a march on him. If, for instance, the King of Egypt took the title of Caliph, as it is alleged he wishes to do, it would arouse strong opposition from Ibn Saud. 187. The Caliphate question received much publicity during the year. The Sheikh A1 Maraghi was believed to favour an Egyptian Caliphate, and articles on the subject even appeared in the Egyptian press. His Majesty’s Minister, in reporting to the Foreign Office on this point, said that, while Ibn Saud could afford, on the whole, to ignore the policy of the Imam, w^ho called himself Commander of the Believers, it would be otherwise if King Farouk were to take the title of Caliph, since Egypt, in virtue of her geographical situation, population and relative wealth, held a position which must give importance to any act of her ruler. Even if the assumption of the title were accompanied by a declaration that its efficacy wms only claimed in Egyptian territory, suspicion would not be completely allayed. Ibn Saud is prepared to co-operate with other Moslem countries on equal terms, but not to allow any other to assume the leadership. A scheme which had been suggested in private by His Highness the Agha Khan, that each of the Arab rulers should style himself Caliph for internal purposes, might not agree with Ibn Saud’s religious principles, and, in any case, he would dislike to have the choice thrust upon him, whether to assume the local title of Caliph or to leave King Farouk’s assumption of that title unchallenged. Soviet Russia. 188. Soviet representation in Saudi Arabia ceased to exist in September 1938. In May His Majesty’s Minister received a confidential message from the Amir Faisal, saying that the Soviet Charge d’Affaires, Ali Bey Fattahoff, had informed him that the Soviet Government had decided to close their legations in Saudi Arabia and the Yemen in order to show their disapproval of the Anglo- Italian Treaty. In reporting this to His Majesty’s Government, Sir R. Bullard gave it as his opinion that, by shutting their legation in Jedda, the Soviet Government would lose nothing but the slight propaganda value of their doctor, since (1) they have no subjects in Saudi Arabia, and, owing to anti-religious and fianncial causes, they never have any pilgrims; (2) the considerable sum of money which had been owing to them by the Saudi Government for some years had now been paid; (3) since the publication of the instructions (paragraph 16) designed mainly to prevent Italian propaganda the members of the Soviet Legation were unable to maintain their close contact with local people; and (4) the legation46 had long been little more than a translation bureau ^hence news and opmions collected from the Arabic newspapers m the Near and Middle East could be suit to Moscow. 189. His Majesty’s Government were very sceptical about Soviet indignation at the' Anglo-Italian Agreement as the real ground fo&gt; thei decision, and suggested that the closing of the Soviet Legation in » w as part of the general policy of the Soviet Government to reduce the number of points of contact with the foreign world, as evinced for instance, by the e g of the Soviet Consulates in Turkey, Persia and Afghanistan. H's Mai est y - Ambassador in Moscow suggested that perhaps one reason was nqmdatio of the Soviet Minister, M. Khakimoff (then on leave), by methods less ciude t , those usually employed. The grounds for the scepticism felt by His Majesty s Government were conveyed to the Saudi Government who appeared to be equal y sceptical In point of fact, when the time came to leave, M Fattahoff and his secretary, M. Litvin, explained the closing of the legation as due to lack of work and consequent waste of money, and said that relations between the Sau Arabian Government and Soviet Russia were not being severed but would be maintained through the representatives of the two countries m London. 190 M. Fattahoff first went to San’a, where he closed down the trade delegation and withdrew the Soviet lady doctor who had been working there On his return to Jedda he notified his colleagues that the legation would be closed as from the 11th September, on which he and his staff would leave Jedda. departure was marred by the refusal of the legation doctor. Dr. Stepukoff to leave Jedda on the ground that his return to Soviet Russia would mean his execution. M. Fattahoff delayed his departure for two days m the hope of inducing the doctor to change his mind, but without effect. Dr Stepukoff, w is popular as a medical man, has obtained the permission of Ibn Saud to practise in Jedda. 191 According to Dr. Stepukoff, what decided him not to return to Soviet Russia was the fate of several persons formerly connected with the Soviet Legation in Jedda. He declares that the Soviet Minister M. Khakimoff his predecessor M Turakuloff, and an employee named Tuimetoft and Ins wife, have all been executed. Whether this is for failure to make any converts to Marxism in the Hejaz or for some other reason is not known, but the Soviet piopagauda, if there was any, had no effect. Spain. 192 Several hundred subsidised pilgrims from the Spanish Zone of Morocco arrived for the 1937-38 pilgrimage on a. vessel flying the Franco flag. They were much less in evidence in the Hejaz than those of the year before and if they made efforts to engage in propaganda, they had no efiect on the Mecca press.' They were again looked after by a Franco official attached to the Italian Legation. 193 News was received from Benghazi that a certain Hainan Mohammed- bin-Mohammed Ben Amer had been appointed consul-general for Nationalist Spain at Jedda. but, so far as the legation could learn, he never reached the Hejaz_ Fuad Bev stated that the 7 *e could be no such appointment as Saudi Ar abia had no relations with insurgent Spain—or with the Spanish Government eithei% for that matter. A Moorish propagandist for General Franco, Ahmad-bm-Seddiq, came to the Hejaz early in the year on a short visit, but it is not believed that his efforts, such as they were, had any great effect. Afghanistan. 194 A falling off in the number of Afghan pilgrims, which was probably entirely'due to the fall in the Afghan exchange, was attributed by the Saudi authorities to action by the Afghan Government stimulated by the malevolence of the Afghan Minister, with whom there had been trouble about a house at Taif three years before, and this led to a dispute which, it was believed, might lead to the withdrawal of the minister. The dispute was smoothed over outwardly, but resentment at the loss of revenue remained in the heart of the Saudi Minister of Finance.47 Iran. 195. Iran has no political interests in Saudi Arabia, but Ibn Saud is suspicious of Iranian policy in the Persian Gulf, in particular in Bahrein. 196. Although the only Iranian interest in this country is the pilgrimage, the new Iranian Minister in Cairo, who appeared in February to present his credentials as Minister to Saudi Arabia, also did not come in time for the pilgrimage, being detained, as he declared, by some international conference in Cairo. The pilgrimage from Iran continues to be insignificant, since very few Iranian subjects can manage to obtain the considerable sum in foreign exchange without which the pilgrimage is impossible. United States. 197. The rapid development in the Hasa oil-field is leading to a great increase in the economic interests of the United States in Saudi Arabia and in the number of American citizens in the country. In Hasa, where formerly there were no non-Moslem foreigners, there is already a large American community, and even in Jedda C.A.S.O.C. are planning to build a large building outside the town as their headquarters, with a mansion for the manager and a dozen houses for the staff. 198. There is still no representative of the United States Government in Saudi Arabia. Political relations were limited to—perhaps inaugurated by—the despatch of a long letter by Ibn Saud to President Roosevelt at the end of November on the subject of Palestine. During the Riyadh visit Fuad Bey informed His Majesty’s Minister that the King had been deeply shocked by what he considered the partisan attitude of the President of the United States in his references to Palestine and wished to send him a protest, but would like to have the views of His Majesty’s Government first. Fuad Bey suggested that this action might even be of assistance to His Majesty’s Government, who appeared to be subjected to pressure from elements in America. His Majesty’s Govern ment approved the reply suggested by Sir R. Bullard, viz., that this was a matter for the decision of Ibn Saud, and that the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the United States Government should be left out of account. 199. A copy of the letter to Mr. Roosevelt was communicated to His Majesty’s Legation. It sets forth the Arab case fully, claims that the policy followed hitherto has been contrary not only to the promises given to the Arabs by the Allies, but to the principle of self-determination laid down by President Wilson, and calls upon the noble American people to help “ a peaceful, quiet people who are attacked by crowds driven forth from various countries on the earth.” The language is moderate, on the whole, but there is a reference to the “ scandalous oppression which is being brought to bear upon a peaceful people living in their own country.” It had been supposed by Sir R. Bullard that this was a private letter, but, on learning that it had reached the President, the Saudi Government published it with a great flourish. Japan. 200. That the interest taken by Japan in Islam is increasing is established by a statement made in the Lower House in Tokyo by the Foreign Minister on the 30th January. According to Reuter, the statement was as follows: “We are giving full consideration to the problem of co-operation with Mahometans. The exchange of ministers with Iran had just that behind it. We are also maintaining close contact with Japanese students of Mahometanism.” 201. Japan is still not represented officially in Jedda, but in May a junior member of the Japanese Embassy in London informed a member of the Foreign Office that a representative of the Saudi Government had suggested to a repre sentative of the Japanese Government that Japan should open a legation at48 Jedda. The statement seemed to have been made under the impression that Saudi Arabia was a British protectorate or at least in alliance with the United Kingdom in the same way as Iraq and Egypt. It was explained to Mr. Kodaki that Saudi Arabia was an entirely independent country and not in alliance with His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Kodaki expressed his thanks for this informa tion, and said that the Japanese Government had wished to communicate the suggestion to His Majesty’s Government because it was their wish to do nothing incompatible with Anglo-Japanese friendship. 202. A man named Muhsin Japan-oglou, who is perhaps a Turkish- Japanese half-caste, and who appeared to have some obscure mission from the Japanese, came to the Hejaz in April after a visit to the Yemen. He registered with the Saudi authorities as Muhammad Muhsin-bin-Sadiq, a Turk and president of the Moslem Association of Japan. His Majesty’s Legation learned that he came with the avowed intention of setting up a Japanese propaganda bureau such as is believed to exist in Egypt, and that, on being informed by the authorities that no political propaganda could be permitted in the holy land of the Hejaz, he left the country after a short visit to Mecca. 203. In April the Saudi Government asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Minister about an invitation which they had received from the Japanese Govern ment to send a representative for the inauguration of a new mosque in Tokyo; the Egyptian Government were sending a delegate, and the Yemen was to be represented by the Amir Husain. Sir R. Bullard gave his personal opinion to the following effect: The object of the Japanese Government might be mainly political propaganda, but, from the point of view of the Saudi Government, the opening of a mosque was a purely religious affair in which they could take part without fear of being misunderstood; the Government responsible for the holy places of Islam would naturally be unwilling to lag behind the Governments of Egypt and the Yemen in this matter, and, while it was for the Saudi Govern ment to decide, Sir R. Bullard saw no harm in participation. In the end the Saudi Government appointed Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, their Minister in London, to represent them at the ceremony, the extent of whose religious significance was indicated to some extent by the prominence of the Italian representative in Japan and the absence of those of Turkey and Afghanistan. The scheme is not likely to have had any great effect on Ibn Saud. 204. Only seven Japanese are known to have made the pilgrimage in 1938. In July the Mecca press announced that Yahya Musa Bukhari had reached Tokyo to carry out propaganda for the coming pilgrimage. It is the custom for touts to be sent to Moslem communities abroad to advertise the pilgrimage, and this Yahya, who is a boy of 19, is in fact the son of a Jedda pilgrim guide, Sheikh Abdullah Musa Bukhari; but it is probable that he had other objects also in visiting Japan. His father had stated some months before that he was sending him to Japan to become an expert in electricity, but there is reason to believe that the young man was acting as go-between for a Turki-speaking general from Chinese Turkestan, Mahmud Si Jang, who took refuge in India and then came on the pilgrimage, and who is reported to be inclined to assist the Japanese against Soviet influence in Sinkiang. China. 205. A few Chinese Moslems come to Mecca for the pilgrimage, but the number is usually so small that the Saudi statistics record them with other miscellaneous elements from the Far East, 6.y., Filipinos. In 1938, however, the Chinese were in evidence because among them was a group of men who described themselves as the Chinese Moslem Near-East Goodwill Mission, and stated that the rnajn puipose of their journey was to arouse sympathy in Moslem countries foi China, especially for Chinese Moslems who have suffered at the hands of the Japanese. Saudi Ai abia would tend to have a greater interest in a country with many millions of Moslems, such as China, rather than in Japan, which is an almost purely non-Moslem country, but whether the propaganda of the mission had any effect in this or any other respect was never ascertained.49 (D) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 206. According to a Mecca newspaper, two Saudi delegates are to attend the International Postal Conference to be held in the Argentine in x\pril 1939, but the Saudi Government refused invitations to send representatives to the conference held at Oxford in September by the International Federation for Documentation, or to a conference to consider the possibility of reaching an agreement on the exemption of liquid fuel and lubricants used in air traffic. 207. The well-known hostility of the Saudi Government to certain clauses of the 1926 Sanitary Convention was not diminished when they learned that the Government of Egypt desired to take over the duties of the International Quarantine Board ; and they requested the sympathy and support of His Majesty’s Government in an attempt to secure revision of the clauses to which they took exception, and seemed to think that their object might be achieved, or at least their grievances examined, at the conference which had been convened to meet in Paris in October to consider the transfer of the duties of the Quarantine Board to the Egyptian Government. His Majesty’s Government devoted much thought to the devising of means by which some satisfaction might be given to the Saudi Government, at least in form, and eventually an arrangement was made by which the matter was put down for examination at the meeting of the Pilgrimage Commission in Paris in May 1939. In a letter from the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office to the Saudi Minister in London, dated the 28th September, there appears this passage:— “ Before May His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Govern ment could consider together what changes in the convention, designed to give effect to the wishes of the Saudi Arabian Government, would, in fact, be practicable, and it is to be hoped that they might be able to agree upon a number of draft amendments. The Saudi Arabian representative at the Pilgrimage Commission could, in due course, put forward these draft amend ments as the considered proposals of the Saudi Arabian Government and the ETiited Kingdom representative would support them.” An enclosure to this letter attempted to explain for the information of the Saudi Government that the articles of the convention to which they take exception cast no reflection on the Hejaz, and that the Saudi Arabian Government would not necessarily be better off if these articles were abolished, since they prescribe maximum measures whereas in their absence each Government would be free to take such action as seemed to it necessary at the moment. 208. The League of Nations has ceased to interest Ibn Sand. He never even refers to it now. (E) Treaties. 209. No important international instruments were signed by Saudi Arabia during 1938. The only treaties of which the legation have a record are the subidiary agreements with Iraq which have already been mentioned in paragraph 25, viz. :— With— Place and Date of Signature. Nature and Subject. Place and Date of Exchange of Ratifications. Date of Entry into Force. Iraq Bagdad, May 19, 1988 Provisional agreement regarding the administration of Neutral Zone on the frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia May 19, 1938 Iraq Bagdad, May 19, 1938 Provisional agreement regulating grazing between Iraq and Saudi Arabia May 19, 1938 Iraq Bagdad, May 19, 1938 Provisional agreement regarding nationality of border tribes - May 19, 193850 III.— Internal Affairs. General Situation. 210. The discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia in commercial quantities, whicn occurred in February 1938, is bound to have important consequences. The remoter possibilities, e.g., that any rich oil-bearing country may some day be a bone of contention between Great Powers, may be left aside, and the more immediate effect examined. If, as the company concerned have come to believe, Hasa contains an important oil-field of the Iraqi or Persian order, the revenue accruing to the Government in the way of a royalty, at something like £1 sterling on every 3 tons of crude oil, may in a year or two be very large. At present the main source of revenue is the pilgrimage; the principal item of expenditure, the subsidising of the tribes. The ruler acquires funds by means of the collection of pilgrim dues which fluctuate with the economic situation in other countries and must, in any case, be collected through officials of doubtful ability and honesty, and he is dependent on these funds for the distribution of the annual subsidies whereby , the tribes are kept quiet. Oil revenues, on the other hand, will be obtained from the unresisting earth by a foreign company which will pay them into a foreign bank where they will be safe from any unauthorised hand, and this should contribute much towards the stability of the established regime. The regime might be even further strengthened if the oil revenues allowed the ruler to reduce the dues on pilgrims, thereby leaving more money for the pilgrims to spend in the country, and thus contenting the Hejazis, who used to live on the pilgrimage and now see their income greatly diminished or completely gone. 211. With every year that Ibn Saud lives the question of the stability of the regime after his death becomes more urgent. For years his health has been watched with an anxious eye with that factor in mind. As statesmen go, he is by no means an old man; indeed, he is apparently two years younger than the age which has usually been attributed to him in these reports, for he informed His Majesty’s Minister at Riyadh, after a careful calculation, that he was 58 (Moslem) years, which is 56 by calendar reckoning, and this agrees with the belief that he was 20 when he captured Rivadh in January 1902. But his public and private life has been unusually exhausting, and he looks more than 56, and he has had many private worries recently, in particular, the death of his favourite “ wife,” Umm Mansur, an Armenian slave, and the serious illness of her successor. Mr. Philby declares that Ibn Saud is becoming very slack physically and very difficult to stimulate to any action requiring mental or moral energy. Allowance must be made for the fact that Mr. Philby may have tried to make Ibn Saud adopt some violent policy which the King's habitual caution led him to reject, but it is certain that Ibn Saud is becoming physically inert and moves very slowly and heavily and dislikes having to mount stairs; that he is very fussy about his health, and this not merely because of the decline in his sexual vigour; and that there is proof of some indifference to public affairs in that during the summer he spent on supervising the building of a new palace at Riyadh a length of time which he would never have spared from work a few year ago. At the same time, when the necessity to take action about Palestine arose in November, he threw himself into the problem with a vigour which seemed undiminished. 212. There is always plenty of gossip, usually ill-informed, about supposed dissensions in the Royal family. Apart from the common belief that the second son, Faisal, is jealous of the heir apparent, there are strong rumours that the third and fourth sons of the King, Muhammad and Khalid, are also hostile to him. There is good reason to believe that the Amir Khalid, son of the King’s elder brother Muhammad, was regarded as an active danger to the heir apparent until his death as the result of a car accident in 1938 removed him from the scene. Such was the hostility between the cousins that Khalid’s death was in many quarters not accepted as accidental, but there is no doubt whatsoever that this suspicion was entirely without foundation. Nevertheless, the enormous size of the Royal family is bound to complicate the task of Ibn Saud’s successor. Apart from nephews and other more distant relatives, Ibn Saud has twenty-six or more sons. The ages of the four eldest are, roughly : Saud, 37; Faisal, 33 ; Muhammad, 26; Khalid, 23. Mansur is not far behind Khalid in age, and there are several51 S/O others not much younger. If Ibn Saud lives long enough to plant out a number of these young men in amirates or other posts and thus to provide them with some thing other than cars and women to fill their time, they may perhaps be content, but if not, the Amir Saud will have some difficulty in disposing of them. Here again, however, the oil revenues should simplify the task, and the standing army, if it comes into existence, may have a value to the ruler against possible rivals if not to the country against enemies from outside. 213. Although the Mecca newspapers frequently publish sycophantic articles praising the King’s policy, the Hejazi L^s little love for a regime which exploits the Hejaz and drains the pilgrim revenue away to Riyadh, and which moreover carries out this policy through “ foreigners,” i.e., Arabs who are not Hejazis. Nothing more has been heard of the “ Friends of the Hejaz ” as such (paragraph 184 of 1937), but a wealthy young Hejazi professes to belong to a society with separatist aims, and although his policy may seem futile, if only because the Hejaz could hardly live on its own resources, there is no doubt that the feeling of hostility is deep. The waste in which the Royal family indulge is particularly resented, and, indeed, it is difficult to defend the careless extravagance which leads the King to travel from Mecca to Riyadh, as he did in 1938, with a train consisting of 558 motor vehicles. However, even the violent objector who has been quoted does not propose that any action should be taken as long as Ibn Saud is alive. The King does not appear to worry about the possibility of trouble in the Hejaz, but the Umm-al-Qura did publish an article in May reproaching those who complain because the Hejaz has not become the world’s wonder in a moment, and recommending them to compare this country not with certain other lands, but with what it was a few years ago. The article mentions as important changes for the better (1) the establishment of security throughout the country; (2) the improvements in the Public Health Service; and (3) the introduction of comfortable cars which facilitate communication. Only the first of these claims is fully justified. The Health Service is more pretentious than efficient, and the cars have not yet those good roads to move on that comfort of travel requires. Moreover, so long as the population of the Hejaz are, as they think, deprived of their means of livelihood by State policy, reforms will not be appreciated. They know that they made more money out of the pilgrimage when security was less well assured, and that is a conclusive argument. Nor does the pilgrim appreciate fully what the establishment of order in the Hejaz means to him, since to be held up on the road seems a remote contingency, whereas the payment of a large sum to the Saudi Government in fees and charges is an unpleasant fact. 214. Ibn Saud’s capitulation to the ulema, who objected to Accession Day ceremonies as self-glorification, was recalled in January 1938 when one number of the Umm-al-Qura announced that “the usual religious celebrations” would be held in Jedda on Accession Day, and the next number said the word “ religious ” had been inserted by a clerical error and added : “In this country there are no religious celebrations except those enjoined by Allah and his Prophet for prayers and for the pilgrimage.” The purely secular character of Accession Day is emphasised by the limitation of the ceremonies to Jedda and by its observance according to the solar calendar, whereas for all other anniversaries the lunar calendar prescribed by Mahomet is observed. In other respects too Ibn Saud’s religious policy remains unchanged. He again asserted, at public dinners held after the pilgrimage, his adherence to the four orthodox sects of Islam. A curious sense of religious (and perhaps dynastic) propriety was revealed by the issue of a regulation prohibiting the marking of packages from abroad with the full name of a Moslem consignee, particularly where the name is distinguished by religious or other associations. The initials only must be used. 215. Innovations manage to creep into the country, with or without official encouragement. Last year the King allowed a silent film of the pilgrimage to be taken; in 1938, a sound film. Advertisements of mouth-organs can be seen in the Mecca press, and when His Majesty’s Minister was at Riyadh in November he found that the servants at the Badi’a palace played gramophones at night, even in Ramadan, while smoking among chauffeurs and workmen seemed to be common and not very discreet. A welcome innovation was a regulation for the protection of animals from overwork and brutal treatment. This measure was52 ascribed by the Mecca press to the influence of the precepts of Islam but was much more probably an imitation of western practice in this respect I he system o regular police has been extended to Hasa, and the town police of Riyadh have been put into a uniform which is a compromise between East and W est m that the khaki tunic has a khaki shirt attached to it. In the attitude towards women, ^ , however, there is no change. Another article was published recommending e home as the only place for women, and it ended with the assurance that the woman who rocks the cradle with her right hand rocks the world with her lett. As a result of the practice by which women servants and slaves are segregated in ground-floor rooms which have no opening on the street and admit on y sue i air and light as can enter by a small door on the court-yard the womenfolk m the King’s palace are ravaged by tuberculosis. An Egyptian lady doctor who was engaged for the palace at a high salary managed, before she resigned m disgust at her helplessness, to recommend that the new palace, which was about to be built should have windows on the street on the ground floor, and this was supported by the American mission doctors from Bahrein who were consulted by the King. It is said that Ibn Saud promised to introduce this improvement, but the traditional belief that an aperture that admits light and air from the street will sooner or later admit lovers for the inmates must have got the upper hand, for the new palace shows no change in this respect. Economic and Financial. 216. A reference to the development of the Hasa oil-field and to the efiect which the resulting revenue may have upon the future of the country was made in paragraph 210 above. The discovery of this natural resource came very appro priately at a time when two successive dry years had left most of the country with little or no pasture and driven many Saudi tribes northwards into the territories of Ibn Saud’s neighbours in search of grazing for their flocks and herds. It is early to prophesy as to the extent of the oil-field, but the company are very optimistic both as to its extent and as to the quality of the oil. In comparison with oil the work of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate must appear insignificant, even if the results seemed likely to approach the most sanguine estimate, which is not the case. At the present moment the syndicate are^laying 37 miles of pipe-line to bring water to the mine to work the ore, and this must add considerably to the cost of production, and offset to a large extent the rise in the price of gold. Working on behalf of the Saudi Govern ment C A S.O.C. have been boring for water at Jedda and Taif, but without result. At the end of the year deep boring was being carried out at Riyadh in the hope of finding artesian water in quantity sufficient for irrigation. 217. The communications problem is being tackled slowly. Not content with wireless telegraphv, for which he has some sixty stations, the King has commissioned C.A.S.O.C. to supply him with about fifteen wireless telephone sets. An expert was borrowed from Palestine to report on the postal, telegraph and telephone system. The negotiations between Saudi Arabia and Egypt about the Mecca-Jedda-Medina roads went on throughout the year: but it was not until Januarv 1939 that the agreement was concluded and the way was clear for these urgent works to be effected. The Saudi Government already possess a tank for the storage of Diesel oil in bulk, and they propose to have tanks for petrol erected in Jedda and smaller ones at various places in the interior. With the aid of the manager of S.A.M.S. many of the beacons and buoys marking the entrance and the channel of Jedda harbour have been replaced by better ones But the event of the year in the matter of communications is the realisa tion of the Saudi dream of a Saudi port on the Persian Gulf with regular calls by foreign steamers. The Saudi authorities hope to have a large port at Ras Tanura, roughly opposite Bahrein, and two or three steamers bringing material for C.A.S.O.C. did, in fact, call there in December. Whether the Saudi dream will ever be fully realised is extremely doubtful. The experts are inclined to think that Ras Tanura will merely be an anchorage where cargo can be tran shipped into barges and towed to Ujair for Hofuf and Riyadh, or to other small ports for the local requirements of the oil company. It takes about as long to reach Hofuf in a car as it does to get to Basra, where the traveller has &amp; several air and steamship lines and a railway at his disposal; while Hofuf is separated from Ujair by a belt of sand, and Ujair is still some hours of T53 bad going from Ras Tanura. But jealousy of Bahrein and Koweit is strong in Saudi minds, and it is certain that great efforts will be made to create at Ras Tanura a port in the full meaning of the word. 218. In spite of the discovery of oil in commercial quantities and the consequent receipt of considerable sums of money from C.A.S.O.C., there was a slight increase in the pilgrim dues, and no decrease in the heavy import duties. No figures of income and expenditure are published, and if they were published they might be as remote from the facts as the annual statement of the semi-official motor-car company, which is vitiated by the allowance of only 20 per cent, for depreciation, whereas the average life of a motor-car belonging to the company must be nearer eighteen months than five years. The Saudi riyal has been less stable this year than for a year or two before. Instead of remaining at about 20 to the gold pound it depreciated towards the end of the year to 22 and more. In fact, the depreciation was rather greater than it would have been had the riyal been pegged to sterling and had varied with sterling against gold. Orders were issued for the withdrawal from circulation of the heavy Saudi riyals which were current before the introduction of the new riyal, which is identical in size and fineness with the rupee, and for the withdrawal of Maria Theresa dollars; and public warnings were issued against forged riyals which were alleged to be in circulation. The new riyal is establishing itself more and more widely, but the fluctuations resulting from the lack of any real backing are disconcerting, and the Netherlands Bank in Jedda were con sidering possible schemes for stabilising the riyal towards the end of the year. 219. It is regrettable to see much attention being paid to the creation of a standing army and none to the reorganisation of revenue and finance work. The observer ivould like to believe that as the revenue from oil begins to grow, so the charges on pilgrims and the taxes on the public will be lowered, and efforts will be made to pay officials adequately and regularly, but there is only too much cause to believe that personal extravagance, and after that the standing army, will have the first call on the increase in revenue. The fact is that Ibn Saud’s abilities, which grapple as readily with world politics as with politics on a tribal scale, are not equal to the more laborious work of finance, for which native wit is not enough, and he leaves that work to others who may or may not place his interests and the country’s before their own. Constitutional Development and Administration. 220. Constitutional development continues to matter very little in Saudi Arabia. The Legislative Council was prolonged for another year, and three of its members were appointed as a drafting committee. One of the members of the Assembly gave in Egypt what was no doubt an inspired interview, in the course of which he declared that Ibn Sand intended to introduce the method of election for membership of the council instead of that of nomination by him self, “with the object of admitting (the people) to participation in the work of government and training them in parliamentary legislative methods,” but nothing to that effect had been published or otherwise mentioned in this country. Another important project which was accepted by the King also came to nothing. It was officially announced that at a meeting at Riyadh (a meeting such as occurs every year when the tribes are collected for their subsidies) a proposal by the King for the establishment of a Higher Council of State was adopted with acclamation, and that the King issued orders for the project to be put into execution, but no steps seem to have been taken to give effect to the orders. Whatever form is given to the constitutional framework of the country, it will be the orders of Ibn Saud that will matter, but it is of interest to speculate on the reasons for such announcements. To some extent they must be considered the bright ideas of people who are experimenting in the art of governing a complicated State as against a collection of tribes, but the announcement in an Egyptian paper that members of the Legislative Assembly were to be elected may have been issued because of criticism to which Saudi Arabia is subjected in other Arab countries as the most “backward” of all of them—a criticism to which the formation of a council in Koweit may have added point during the last few months.54 221 Fuad Bey is probably correct in claiming, as he has done m conversa tion with His Majesty's Minister, that constitutional forms matter very little in this country, and that the King has five men whom he trusts and through whom he works, without being particular whether he always uses the same channel five are the Amirs Baud and Faisal, Sheikh Abdullah feulaiman, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, and himself, Fuad Bey. It is, however, important to keep in mind a point which Fuad Bey did not mention, viz., that one of these, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, differs from the others in enjoying a wider measure of independence or rather in having some independence whereas the others have none, it seems certain that the King, who manages all political affairs himself, gives Abdullah Sulaiman a free hand in the Finance Department so long as he produces funds for the Royal purposes whenever called upon to do so. It is curious that a man with so deep a knowledge of Arab human nature as the King possesses should be so indifferent to the effect of heavy taxation on his people. A recent calcula tion shows that the retail price of sugar in the Jedda bazaar is over four times the cost c.i.f. Jedda, and that nearly all the difference goes into the coffer of the State or rather into the coffer controlled by Abdullah Sulaiman On the other hand’ Abdullah Sulaiman seems to make no attempt to effect regular payment ot the salaries of small officials and police, but makes odd payments now and then to keep the complainants alive and at work. Mr. Philby, who as an ex-Indian Civil Servant has been brought up to realise the immense importance of revenue policy, criticises this indifference of Ibn Sand's on this point as a great defect in his regime and a serious danger. He maintains that not only has Abdulla Sulaiman a free hand in finance' but that he keeps no proper accounts, and it is considered that this charge is probably well founded. IV.— Military and Naval Organisation. 222. The prospect of a steady flow of cash into the Treasury from the Hasa oil royalties has encouraged Ibn Sand to express the intention of establishing a standing army, and a Mecca paper even announced a forthcoming militaiy review of 30,000 men at Riyadh. In fact, it is improbable that much has been done to develop the armed forces of this country beyond making small increases m the three existing military bodies, “ zikurt,' “ shurta ’ and the army proper (paragraph 189 of 1937). 223. In the Interior of the Hejaz little military development took place, but along the northern frontier continued activity is reported. Guns as well as machine guns are said to have been seen at Tebuk, while the detaenments holding frontier posts on the Iraq frontier are now equipped like those on the Trans jordan side, with cars, wireless and riding camels. 224. In March a consignment of guns and small arms presented by the Italian Government to Ibn Saud reached Jedda. It was said that the present was to give Ibn Saud an idea of what Italy could produce in the way of arms, but nothing has been heard since of any orders for quantities being placed, though an unconfirmed report indicated that an order had been placed through a Swiss firm. At the time Ibn Saud told His Majesty’s Minister that he had been obliged to accept the present against his will. 225. Saudi Arabia still possesses nothing in the way of a naval force. V. —Aviation. Saudi A ir Force. 226. In spite of the acceptance by the Saudi Government of the Air Ministry’s offer of training of Saudi mechanics at the Royal Air Force depot at Aboukir, no attempt to take advantage of the offer was made during 1938. The legation never discovered what was the cause of the delay, though at one time the authorities seemed to have been waiting for the British to take the next step, whereas the arrangement had been that the details should be settled between the Saudi representative in Cairo and the British authorities concerned. It is55 possible that the Saudi Government are slowly coming to the conclusion that to run an air force is a much more expensive and difficult business than they at first supposed. 227. One of the Saudi pilots went to Egypt for training at the Misr- Airwork flying school as a civil pilot, at his own expense. The offer of the British Council to assist two Saudi pilots to obtain instruction in navigation at a civil flying establishment in the United Kingdom is referred to in paragraph 149. This offer was not passed on to the Saudi Government in 1938. 228. In accordance with the request from the Saudi Government which is recorded in paragraph 204 of 1937, His Majesty’s Government endeavoured to find a Moslem officer capable of advising them on aviation, but they were driven to the conclusion that there was no such officer to be found in India, Iraq or Egypt. The Foreign Office suggested that it might be possible to attach to His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda a British officer with flying experience who could be useful to the Saudi Government in the matter of aviation, but the suggestion was informal and its obvious objections were not minimised. The Saudi Govern ment agreed that the objections were serious and did not follow up the suggestion. 229. The Italian air mission therefore remained the sole instructors of the Saudi pilots, with the exception of the White Russian Naidyonoff. Their personal position appears to have improved somewhat during the year under review; in February it was learnt that the head of the mission, Major Ciccii, had been supplied with a car by the Minister of Finance and Defence, so that he was no longer obliged to walk 2 miles to the aerodrome as in the past. In April, however, the Saudi pilots were still ignoring him and planning with Naidyonoff to go off to Taif, leaving the Italians behind them. In May there was another change, the Saudi pilots being allowed until they tired of it to attend the major’s classes on navigation, and due prominence being given to his nationality in a press account of a flight to Yanbu (paragraph 232) which was undertaken by the entire air force. Major Ciccu certainly made strenuous efforts to increase his influence, and was supported in this by Said-al-Kurdi, the pan-Arab fanatic who commands the Jedda garrison. The Jedda climate, however, affected the major s health very adversely, and he was obliged to proceed on sick leave in August, being succeeded by Colonel Gori Savellini. 230. In April the French Government presented the Saudi Arabian Government with a second monoplane of the single-engined low-wing Caudron type with a 220-horse-power six-cylinder Renault engine. M. Naidyonoff has undertaken extensive repairs to the Wapitis, purchased by the Saudi Arabian Government in 1929-30 and since wrecked, and, although the work was delayed by his absence on leave, two machines were completely repaired during the year under review and brought into use. The Saudi air force is in theory divided into two flights, one under the head of the Italian Air Mission, consisting of three Capronis, two Italian instructional machines and the recently-arrived Caudron- Renault;’ and the other, under M. Naidyonoff, of one Bellanca, the older Caudron-Renault and four Wapitis, of which only two are airworthy. 231. Of the dozen or so young Italian-trained Saudis, only five, including the one who has gone to Egypt, have shown such aptitude as warrants their retention as pilots. They are believed to be efficient at straightforward flying, but have had no practice in aerobatics and no training in navigation. Flying activities were suspended for long periods owing to shortage of petrol and oil, and this in spite of the fact that the aviation budget for the current Moslem year was fixed at £16,500 gold (about £28,000). This, it is reliably stated, was more than had ever been allotted to aviation before. 232 In May four machines flew to Yanbu, a coast town some 175 miles north of Jedda, and back, taking two hours and ten minutes for the outward and just over two hours for the homeward journey. The machines concerned were the Bellanca, piloted by M. Naidyonoff. and three Capronis, two piloted by four Saudis and the other by Major Ciccu and a Saudi. The native pilots appear to have acquitted themselves well. In the autumn three planes weie seen flying in formation and keeping distance creditably.56 233. There are still no Saudi air mechanics. Some of the machines are maintained by the Italian mechanics of the official Italian Mission, others by two Russian refugees. Other Aviation. 234. The Misr-Airwork inaugurated its seasonal service between Jedda and Medina on the 7th January. The journey took about two hours, and the fare was £9 gold return, plus the Government’s tax of £4-J gold each way. The service was not a success this year as the machine made a bad landing when it had made only one or two trips and remained out of action until after the need for it had passed. 235. The legation learned in July that the Egyptian aviator, Hasan Anis Pasha, proposed to make a flight to Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. It is understood from a non-official source that the Saudi Arabian Government gave permission for the flight, but that the Imam of the Yemen refused. His Majesty’s Government, too, felt obliged to withhold permission for the flight over the Aden Protectorate and along the Persian Gulf. 236. Three questions relating to aviation are mentioned elsewhere :— (1) Flight of British aeroplanes across Saudi Arabia (paragraph 147). (2) Violation of Saudi territory by foreign aircraft (paragraph 12). (3) Proposed international conference on exemption from taxation of liquid fuel and oil used in air traffic (paragraph 206). VI.— Press. 237. The Mecca Umm-al-Qura and Saut-al-Hejaz continued to be the only papers of importance in this country. Apart from the official decrees and laws which appear in them from time to time, they contain very little of interest. In political matters they were held in a very tight grip, and the references to Palestine, with one exception, were mild until the end of the year, when, as was stated in paragraph 74, the King decided to allow a little more latitude in this respect. 238. The persons mentioned in paragraph 208 of 1937 as destined to be sent to Egypt in May 1937 to learn printing finally left at the end of August 1938. VII.— Legislation. 239. The law-making machine of Saudi Arabia, which had been idle during most of 1937, was relatively active in 1938 and produced six measures, of which several have been mentioned already as affecting foreigners. The measures were as follows :— (1) Law concerning Converts to Islam and their Entry into the Two Sanctuaries (published in the Umm-al-Qura on the 21st January).— This measure restricts the right of entry into Mecca and Medina of the recent convert to Islam by requiring him to produce certificates in support of his claim to have been converted, or else to remain in Jedda for fifteen days on probation, during which period his claim is to be examined by a committee and, if it is upheld, a decree is to be issued by the Sharia Court to the effect that he has adopted Islam. This law is unlikely to make any practical change in the procedure applied to recent converts, who will still be regarded with suspicion and have to satisfy the King before being allowed to enter either Mecca or Medina. (2) Residence (of Foreigners) Regulation (published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 28th January).—See paragraph 3 above. (3) Regulation concerning the Hoisting and use of Flags (published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 18th March).—See paragraph 4 above. (4) Regulation concerning the Wholesale and Retail Trade in Medicines, Drugs, Medical Preparations and Herbs (published in the Umm-al- Qura on the 1st April).—This regulation was obviously copied straight57 / /&gt; ’ from the statute-book of some highly organised State, being far too elaborate to be applied properly in this country. The twenty-first article forbids the sale of proprietary medical preparations imported from abroad, unless previous permission is obtained, and this permis sion is only to be authorised by the Health Department after examination and analysis of the preparation. By the end of the year no cases of the application of this article to such rare British proprietary medical articles as may be found in this country had come to the notice of the legation. (5) Instructions concerning the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (published in the Vmm-al-Qura of the 6th May).—These instructions are designed to ensure that no animal shall be over-worked, beaten with undue severity or worked while in ill-health. (8) Saudi Arabian Nationality Regulation No. 3 (published in the Umm-al- Qura on the 16th December).—This is designed to consolidate previous legislation on the subject and follows in the main rules laid down by civilised States. It includes provisions for the acquisition and loss of Saudi Arabian nationality. Its effect in the case of the marriage of a Saudi woman to a foreigner is examined in paragraph 5 above. 240. In addition to these formal measures there were two which were promulgated in a highly informal fashion, viz., those for the establishment of a Higher Council of State and for the formation of a regular army. They were recommended by Ibn Saud in person to a miscellaneous gathering at Riyadh and approved with acclamation, and “His Majesty therefore issued orders for the necessary preparations to be made to put the two schemes into effect.” VIII.— Education. 241. The local press announced in March that “certain persons and intelligent young men ” had proposed the collection, by means of stamps similar to those of the First Aid Society, of funds to be devoted to the education of the Bedouin and the establishment of tribal schools similar to those existing in Iraq. The foundation of a college to be paid for from the funds of the Haramain wakfs in Egypt and elsewhere was also foreshadowed. However, nothing further has been heard of these two projects. 242. In March, too, the Egyptian paper, A l Ahram, stated that the Saudi Government had sent a note to the Egyptian Government to the effect that the curriculum of the Saudi School for the Preparation of “Missions,” i.e., of students who are to be sent abroad to complete their studies, is similar to that of the Egyptian schools, except that history and geography have no place in it, such studies being purposeless in the Hejaz. The Saudi Arabian Government enquired whether, in view of these facts, the certificate given by the school would be regarded in Egypt as the equivalent of the Egyptian secondary school certificate. The answer of the Egyptian Government is unknown, but can be imagined. 243. In an interview given to the Cairo newspaper Al Ayyam the Saudi representative in Egypt, Sheikh Fauzan As-Sabiq, who is the head of the Educa tion Committee, held forth at length on the state of education in this country. He stated that the Saudi Government had sent thirty-six students to Egypt, two to Switzerland, one to Constantinople and twenty to Beirut, and that there are in Saudi Arabia some seventy preparatory schools, forty-one elementary schools and the Saudi Institute. The latter, of whose existence the legation had been unaware, was said to have sections devoted to study for the degree of “master,” to secondary instruction, to law and to calligraphy, while it was proposed to establish sections for Moslem law and for preaching and spiritual guidance. Various other educational projects were mentioned and the number of pupils studying in lay schools in Saudi Arabia was estimated at 14,931. As there is reason to believe that Sheikh Fauzan is Ibn Saud’s favourite channel for conveying to the outside world facts tending to show that Saudi Arabia is not as backward as it is sometimes made out to be, the statements made to the Al Ayyam's representative should be accepted with reserve. They may be examined in the light of the fact that non-Saudi Arabs employed in this country never entrust their children to local schools, but send them away to school in Syria or elsewhere.58 IX.— Public Health. 244. The pilgrimage was “ clean,” and general health conditions in Saudi Arabia were good. 245. There appear to be permanent dispensaries in operation at Hail, Abha, Qunfidha, Jizan, Bahra, Rabigh and Musaijid. Government “ doctors ” are appointed to each post in turn for spells of several months. The travelling doctors mentioned last year continued to pay periodical visits to outlying districts. The dispensary at Hail is now called a “ quarantine station,”' as it lies on the overland pilgrim route from Iraq. A veterinary doctor was brought from Egypt in the spring to examine Government animals. There are two Saudi “ radiologists ” who studied for two years in Egypt and who presumably run the radiotherapeutic section of the Mecca Hospital. 246. Dentistry was, until recently, the monopoly of a self-taught expert whose main business is the sale of camel fodder. In 1938, however, there appeared a man from Chinese Turkestan with a dental diploma from Istanbul, and towards the end of the year the Mecca press began to publish the advertisements of two dentists claiming to have European diplomas. 247. Some activity has been displayed in endeavouring to secure greater cleanliness in the towns of Jedda and Mecca and in fighting mosquitoes by the use of crude oil and petroleum. But, unfortunately, this has coincided with greater activity in street watering, so that the balance is still in favour of the insect. At Muna during the 1938 pilgrimage an effort was made to localise and control the ritual slaughter of sheep. A slaughter-house has been brought into operation at Mecca, served by two motor vans for the distribution of the dead meat. X.— The Pilgrimage. 248. The annual pilgrimage report, forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 16th August, gives full information on the 1938 pilgrimage. It is only necessary to give a short summary here. 249. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th DhuT Hijjah, fell on Wednesday, the 10th February. About 125,000 pilgrims were present at Arafat, of whom 67,474 were from overseas, as against 49,957 the year before. Improved economic conditions and continued propaganda were mainly responsible for the considerable increase. The entry of another line of pilgrim steamers into the Indian pilgrim trade was responsible for a rate war which led to an increase in the Indian pilgrimage, while an improvement in the price of rubber enabled more Javanese and Malays to come. The Sudanese and West African pilgrimages were also larger. 250. The general health of the pilgrims was good. 251. Approximate figures for arrivals of pilgrims in the Hejaz by sea are as follows :— British and British-administered territories- Indian Malayan West African ... Sudanese Palestinian Dutch East Indian Egyptian Others 1937. 1938. 10,588 15,238 2,524 4,589 4,787 6,046 1,658 2.051 428 736 6,857 10,357 10,226 10,096 12,889 14,672 49,957 63,785 i Iraq showed a great increase from 1,185 to 3,436. 253. Destitute pilgrims, mainly from India, amounted to 250, as agains 234 in 1937. 659 _ . ^ m ong the notable persons who made the pilgrimage were the Sheikh of Bahrein and his family, Princess Khadija Abbas of Egypt and the Sultan of Tajura, in French Somaliland. 255. Arrangements for the handling of pilgrims at Jedda worked satis- ac only and the departure of the Indian pilgrims after the pilgrimage went on very smoothly. r &amp; &amp; 256. Owing to the cheapness of the journey from India which resulted from the rate war between the two rival shipping companies, it was feared that the number of destitute pilgrims might increase, and the Saudi Arabian Government asked the legation m September to approach the Government of India with a view to preventing such persons from coming on pilgrimage. The Saudi Arabian Government also raised unofficially the question of the payment by intending pilgrims^ before departure, of a lump sum to cover all their expenses while on the pilgrimage. 257. The attitude of the Saudi Government to the sanitary control of Mecca pilgrims by other countries is described in paragraph 207. XI.— Slavery. 2j 8. Information reached the legation during the year that slaves in small numbers were still reaching the Hasa Province of Saudi Arabia from outside the country. Investigations were made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gult which showed that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was probably an offender and suitable punitive measures were taken. 259. The Saudi slavery regulations promulgated in October 1936 appeared to icmain a dead lettei. One bad case of non-observance of them arose during the year. A Sudanese, Jaber Ahmad, who had formerlv been a slave in the Heiaz, had been manumitted by the agency here in 1927 and sent to the Sudan. In 1937’ having returned to Saudi Arabia on pilgrimage, he was re-enslaved at the instance of his former owner, d be case was taken up by the legation and after some argument he was set free by order of Ibn Saud. On the other hand, a yo n n o* Sudani who was enslaved in this country before the lA^ahabi regime and was found to be a slave in the body-guard of the Amir Saud was sent to Jedda by his master to report to His Majesty’s Minister, whom he informed, with obvious sincerity, that he was married and quite happy and did not wish to go back to the Sudan. XII.— Naval Matters. 260. The following visits were paid to Jedda by the escort vessels of His Majesty’s Navy :— H.M.S. Londonderry, February 7 to 12. H.M.S. Fleetwood, May 26 to 30; iHigust 3 to 4. H.M.S. Weston, September 6 to 12. 261. Two Italian flotilla leaders, Pantera and Leone, visited Jedda for the Saudi Accession Day, the 8th January. They remained from the 7th January until the 9th January. 262. The French sloop D'Iberville visited Jedda from the 8th February until the 11th February. 263. Visits to Jedda continued to be made by His Majesty’s escort vessels by bare notification to the Saudi Arabian Government without any request for permission. No other Saudi ports were visited. 264. ^ The projected survey of certain areas in the Persian Gulf by H.M.S. Challenger during the winter of 1938—39 is dealt with in paragraph 145. 265. The scheme proposed by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) to place a series of buoys and beacons in the approaches to Jedda harbour (paragraph 237 of 1937 report) was put into effect in the course of theyear, but has not yet been completed. An oil tanker of 9,000 tons was enabled by these facilities to discharge at the pipe-line which can be run out from the syndicate’s pier. The operations of the Banque Misr were also continued, and by the end of the year the dredging of the channel for small craft was nearly finished. 266. At Ras Tanura, on the Persian Gulf (see paragraph 144), a deep-water channel to the shore has been buoyed with the assistance of His Majesty’s navy. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have in operation a small pier at A1 Khubar on the mainland just opposite Bahrein island, to serve the oil-field at Damman, which is close by. XIII.— Miscellaneous. 267. Apart from the Athlone visit (paragraph 118), Jedda received a number of visits from non-Moslems during the year under review. Among them were :— Lord Belhaven and Stenton, who as Major Hamilton of the Indian Political Service visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh in 1917. The King gave a dinner party for him at Shumaisi and was obviously touched to meet an old friend. M. Golet, a former Dutch consul in Jedda, who revisited the town to revise a collection of Arabic stories he had made during his term of service here. The late Signor Carlo Alphonso Nallino, the distinguished Italian orientalist and editor of the Oriente Moderno. Advantage was taken of friendly relations established with him to point out some inaccuracies in reference to British affairs in his review. Lieutenant D. R. W. G. Charlton, of the 8th Hussars, who visited Jedda as a guest of Mr. Philby. Mr. Howard Jones, who was the first Office of Works architect ever to visit Jedda. He managed in the course of three days to examine all the properties which are rented for official purposes and to make many valuable suggestions. The half, he implied, had not been told him. Mr. Charles Wills, of Messrs. Gray, MacKenzie and Co. (paragraph 144). 268. The Indian Vice-Consul paid a visit to Medina in March. This was the first time for many years that Medina had been visited by an official represen tative of His Majesty’s Legation. Much useful information was obtained about the state of the road, the needs of the Indian community in Medina, the ways of destitute Indian pilgrims and other matters of importance. 269. An Indian chauffeur who had been, and perhaps still was, in the service of the King came to the legation in May and said that he wished to become a Christian. The enquiry, which was fended off with discretion, appeared to be quite genuine.V . THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GqIeRNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. CONFIDENTIAL. (15503) 1938 y Oopy 37 SAUDI ARABIA. ANNUAL REPORT, 1937. [E 2338/2338/25] Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—{Received April 25.) (No. 57.) My Lord, Jedda, March 26, 1938. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith my annual report for the year 1937. Having been absent from the beginning of July until towards the end of November, I have had to draw upon the reports and despatches of Mr. Trott for that long period. Sections IV to XIII are mainly the work of Mr. Gault and Mr. Judd. 2. I feel that the report is much too long for an out-of-the-way post like Jedda. Unfortunately the peak of the pilgrim season coincided with the months of January and February and I was too busy with pilgrim work, with the greater activity in Saudi diplomatic affairs which always results from the presence of Ibn Saud in the Hejaz, and with other pressing matters, to be able to devote to the condensation of the report the time which the process would have taken. On the other hand, it must be admitted that 1937 was a busy year for Jedda, owing to the Palestine question, the Anglo-Italian situation, and the tendency of Ibn Saud to discuss these and other questions with His Maiesty’s Government at length and to turn to them on all occasions for help and advice.

IBN SAUD had no striking diplomatic success this year as he had last. The adhesion of the Yemen to a highly personal rendering of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance was not much to put beside, for instance, the agreements of 1936 between Saudi Arabia and Egypt; and Ibn Baud’s intervention of the previous year in the Palestine question was considered by him to have been a failure in that the Palestine Moslems, disappointed with the report of the Royal Commission, would be inclined to blame him for the advice he had given them. He had more than one cause for disappointment or anxiety. Italian policy continued to trouble his mind acutely; His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom could not give him any definite guarantee on that point and could not even assist him in the matter of aviation; and the Palestine problem seemed no nearer to solution. On the other hand, he was courted assiduously by the Italians, and he found satisfaction in the knowledge that he was of importance to His Majesty’s Government. A visit paid by Mr. Rendel to Saudi Arabia, although private, was made the occasion for conversations on a variety of subjects; His Majesty’s Government managed to supply him with arms which he seems to have valued at more than five times the price he paid for them; and the plan which was afoot at the end of the year for a visit by Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone to his country was an unprecedented compliment which he appreciated at its full value. 2. Law and order reigned everywhere, even in such formerly wild parts as Najran, and although the Saudi Minister in London told the Foreign Office that Ibn Saud might be unable to restrain his tribes on the Trans-Jordan border if a solution of the Palestine question more favorable to the Arabs was not found, there was no sign that the King’s grip on his tribes had really weakened. But according to a well-informed observer there are tribal elements who, having suffered heavily at the hands of Ibn Saud, are only waiting for him to die before breaking out again. 3. If the King speculates about what will happen after his death he does little to shift the responsibility gradually to the shoulders of his successor. His wireless stations keep him in constant touch with every corner of his kingdom, and he manages personally all affairs of any importance. No successor of his is likely to be able to do that, without his experience and his prestige. On the other hand, Ibn Saud has had to carry on in spite of shortage of revenue and of the difficulties resulting from the fact that such revenue as he has been able to collect has been taken, very invidiously, from pilgrims and indirectly from his Hejaz subjects. At the end of the year it was still doubtful whether oil would ever be found in Saudi Arabia in commercial quantities, but the faint hope that appeared set the foreign observer speculating as to the effect on the country and the Saudi dynasty if a revenue, considerable for so poor a country, could be got from the unresisting earth./7 M \ 3 II. —Foreign Relations. (A).— With States in Arabia. Iraq. 4. The Amir Saud went to Bagdad at the end of March for a week’s visit. From remarks made to him by the Amir on several occasions His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad gathered that the Amir was pleased by the arrangements made for him and gratified by the warmth of the popular welcome given to him \ynen he appeared in public. An exchange of cordial telegrams concluded the visit. i he Amir was accompanied by Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, who received representations from the Iraq Government as to the dissatisfaction which they had long felt with the conduct of the Saudi Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad, Shaikh Ibrahim al Mu’ammar. They doubtless repeated to him complaints which they had made on several occasions to His Majesty’s Ambassador, that Shaikh Ibrahim made a practice of keeping in close touch with the political opponents of the Government, openly belittled King Ghazi and made unfavourable comparisons between him and King Abdul Aziz, and was guilty of other indiscretions. Shortly afterwards Shaikh Ibrahim was removed and replaced by Shaikh Muhammad Id al Rawwaf, formerly Saudi Consul in Damascus and for the preceding two years Deputy Qaimmaqam of Jedda. It seems unlikely that any intrigues of which shaikh Ibrahim may have been guilty were committed under instructions from Ibn Saud, who removed him almost at once when complaints were made to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. 5. While the relations between the two countries have remained outwardly correct and even cordial, Ibn Saud retains a feeling of suspicion against Iraq. His misgivings at the military cony of 1936 were referred to in the report for that year (paragraph 13). He reiterated them at one of the conversations during Mr. Rendel’s visit. Everyone, he said, was suspicious of the new Government and regarded it as not Arab. There was much to be said against Yasin al Hashimi, but at least he had followed an Arab policy. The Hikmet Sulaiman Government was open to two objections : it was communistic, and it was under Turkish influence; and the Turks, who had already began to try to get Alexandretta, would eventually try to acquire Mosul. Mr. Rendel suggested that judgment should be suspended until it could be seen whether the policy was really communistic and not merely one of long-needed social reforms, and gave reasons for thinking that Hikmet Sulaiman was shaking himself free from military influence to some extent and that the Turks were not likely to pursue a policy of adventure. Speaking to Sir R. Bullard at Riyadh in July, Ibn Saud said that however much he must sympathise with Arab aspirations he would rather have had the British as his neighbours than the Iraqis. And in December he spoke with uneasiness of the instability and lack of continuity in Iraq, and with annoyance at reports that certain people in Iraq, e.g., Nuri Pasha, were trying to bring off a “ scoop ” with a Palestine policy designed not for the sake of the Palestinians nor of His Majesty’s Government, but in their own interests. However, he admitted that relations had always been correct. 6. The negotiations about the adhesion of the Yemen to the Iraqi-Saudi Treaty are dealt with in the section on the Yemen. 7. In April His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad informed the Foreign Office that, according to a statement made to him by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Turkish Minister had stated that his Government had no objection to the adhesion of Saudi Arabia to the Four-Power Non-Aggression Pact then about to be signed between Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and Turkey, and that the opportunity of the visit of the Amir Saud would be taken to discuss the matter. His Majesty’s Ambassador assumed the attitude of His Majesty’s Government to be that the proposal was not one in which they were concerned, and was informed that this assumption was correct. Whether the Turkish Government ever broached the subject, either to the Amir Saud or to any other person representing the Saudi Arabian Government, is not known. Palestine. 8. In connexion with the alleged theft of a camel from a Saudi subject at Gaza, the Saudi Government asked for the opinion of His Majesty’s Minister [17650] ^ B 2as to the method of communication about any matter concerning a Saudi subject in Palestine : should there be direct communication between the responsible officials on the frontier, as in the case of Transjordan, or should such mattep be dealt with by the Saudi and United Kingdom Governments? His Majesty’s Minister eventually replied that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom con sidered that the best method of dealing with such matters was by direct negotia tion between the two Governments of Saudi Arabia and Palestine through the intermediary of the Legation at Jedda, as in the past. 9. A point that was overlooked when the 1936 report was compiled was a request from Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan to be informed whether there was any objection to the appointment of a Saudi consul to reside in Palestine with consular jurisdiction in Palestine and Transjordan. In transmitting this request to Palestine Sir Andrew Ryan referred to the exchange of Anglo-Saudi notes on the occasion of the conclusion of the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty of the 27th July, 1933, under which the Saudi Government were entitled to appoint a consul at Amman. The High Commissioner saw no objection to the proposal, but the matter was never referred to again until December 1937, when the Foreign Office informed His Majesty’s Minister that in view of the fact that the Italian Government had expressed a wish to appoint a consul at Amman, it would be embarrassing if the Saudi Government raised the question of the appointment of a Saudi representative at Amman or even at Jerusalem. The Saudi authorities have not raised the question for two years, but whether that is because they took the silence of His Majesty’s Government as a refusal, or whether the request was perhaps made by Fuad Bey on his own account, is not known. 10. The amount of material on the subject of the Jewish National Home is so large, and the subject itself is so wide in its ramifications, that to make a summary in a reasonably small compass is difficult. It seems best to begin with a bare recital of the policy of His Majesty’s Government during the year, to serve as a skeleton to the rest of the section. 11. The Royal Commission which was sitting in Palestine when the year 1936 came to an end completed its labours and returned to England in January 1937. On the 18th March the Palestine (Defence) Order in Council, 1937, was issued, giving the High Commissioner exceptional powers. The report of the Royal Commission and the conclusions of His Majesty’s Government were released on the evening of the 7th July for publication on the 8th July. Dealing with the capital question of immigration the report recommended that a political high level ” of Jewish immigration should be laid down, and that it should be fixed at 12,000 for the next five years, subject always to the economic absorptive capacity of the country. Turning to the question of the Palestine policy as a whole, the Commission recommended, as the only scheme going to the root of the trouble a plan of partition. They proposed that Palestine should be divided into a Jewish and an Arab State, and suggested a provisional boundary which would leave to the former the whole of the north down to Meggido and Beisan and also all the coast southwards to about the latitude of Jerusalem. The present mandate, they recommended, should be terminated. There should be a new mandate for an area including Jerusalem and Bethlehem and a corridor with an outlet at Jaffa, and for the rest the mandatory should conclude treaties on the model of the Iraq precedent in respect of the Jewish area on the one hand, and on the other of an Arab area consisting of Transjordan and what would remain of Palestine, the object being to establish these two areas as soon as possible as sovereign independent States, with protection for minorities. would belono- to the Arab State, which would have access to it through the corridor. On the other hand, there would be on the north-west coast of the Gulf of Aqaba a commercial enclave under the mandatory administration to allow of free transit of goods from there to the Jewish State^ There were financial proposals, among them being a suggestion that the Arab State, which would lose the coast and take in the poor country of Transjordan, should receive a gift of £2 millions from His Majesty’s Government and a regular subsidy Horn the Jewish State. The most important proposal was for an exchange ot land and population, and here the Commission admitted a difficulty, viz., that whereas the Jewish State could provide room for the relatively few Jews who would be left in the Arab State, far more land than the latter would leave vacant would be needed to settle all the Arabs from the Jewish State.5 12. Upon the publication of the report His Majesty’s Government issued a Statement of Policy (Command 5513) in which they said :— “ In the light of experience and of the arguments adduced by the com mission they are driven to the conclusion that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the aspirations of Arabs and Jews in Palestine, that these aspirations cannot be satisfied under the terms of the present mandate, and that a scheme of partition on the general lines recommended by the commis sion represents the best and most hopeful solution of the deadlock. His Majesty’s Government propose to advise His Majesty accordingly.” While the form of a scheme of partition was being worked out His Majesty's Government proposed, the statement continued, that steps should be taken to prohibit any land transactions which might prejudice such a scheme, and that a total Jewish immigration of 8,000 persons should be permitted for the ensuing eight months, provided that the economic absorptive capacity of the country was not exceeded. The statement concluded by enumerating the advantages which the solution offered both to Arabs and to Jews. 13. The Palestine question was debated in Parliament on the 20th and the 21st July, and a resolution was adopted to the effect that, while His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would continue to recommend to the Council of the League and to the Permanent Mandates Commission the endorsement of the general principle of partition, any scheme of partition which might be worked out on the basis of the Royal Commission’s report would have to be submitted to Parliament before it could be finally adopted. 14. At a public meeting on the 16th September the Council of the League of Nations adopted a resolution which had been drawn up by the Permanent Mandates Commission. In this resolution which took account, among other points, of the intention expressed by the United Kingdom Government to pursue the study of the problem of the status of Palestine with special reference to a solution involving partition of the territory, the Council agreed to this study being under taken and the steps it involved adopted, and, while pointing out that the majidate of the 24th July, 1922, remained in force, deferred consideration of the substance of the question until the Council should be in a position to deal with it as a whole, and in the meantime entirely reserved its opinion and its decision. 15. On the 18th November military courts were established by Defence Regulations under the Palestine (Defence) Order in Council, 1937. 16. On the 23rd December the Secretary of State for the Colonies addressed to the High Commissioner for Palestine a despatch embodying the decision of His Majesty’s Government on the next step to be taken. As this decision, however, was not published, or communicated to the Saudi Government until the 4th January, 1938, it seems better to leave this point for treatment next year, though it may be mentioned that the despatch defined the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the partition proposal of the Royal Commission, and stated the terms of reference of the technical commission which was to be sent to Palestine to make further investigations on the subject. 17. The advice given by Ibn Saud to the Arab Higher Committee (para graph 19a of 1936), to co-operate with the Royal Commission, was given on the ground that he was ‘ ‘ confident in the good faith of the British Government and their intention to treat the Arabs justly.” At the same time he was expressing to His Majesty’s Government his regret that they had not thought fit to suspend immigration entirely during the labours of the commission, and was asking for clemency for two Arabs who had been condemned to death by military courts; but when the Mufti of Palestine visited Mecca for the pilgrimage and appealed for help Ibn Saud promised to use his influence in legitimate ways, but urged him to assist in the maintenance of order and to await the report of the Royal Commission. Meanwhile, he was preparing suggestions and recommendations for the solution of the Palestine problem. These were contained in a document dated the 6th February, which was communicated to His Majesty’s Government through the Saudi Minister in London. The document had been prepared, the Minister stated, by Ibn Saud himself, without help or advice from representatives of the Palestine Arabs or from any other source. The King had originally [17650] c * &amp;6 intended to communicate his proposals to the Iraq Government also, but eventually he decided spontaneously not to do so. The document assured His Majesty’s Government of his friendship and his desire to strengthen the bonds between the Arabs and His Majesty’s Government. Only in Palestine had the Arabs departed from that rule, because of the “ever-increasing tide of alien Jews sweeping before it the Arabs, the original inhabitants.” He did not believe all the reports he received, e.g., that the Jews intended to occupy Medina and Kheiber and to demolish the tomb of the Prophet: that suggested propaganda by the enemies of Great Britain, and he had refused to allow a Moslem Congress to be held in Mecca lest this dangerous subject should be brought up. The anxiety of the Arabs was due to the declared aim of the Jews to found a Jewish State in Palestine. The time was critical; the enemies of Great Britain were active in all Arab countries. He wished that if anything should happen in Europe Great Britain might be able to rely on Arab support; otherwise, the Jews themselves might be in great danger. He therefore made these suggestions to His Majesty’s Government:— (1) To grant a general amnesty for crimes committed during the strike and the disturbances; (2) To suspend Jewish immigration—perhaps for ten years; (3) To introduce land legislation to protect the small landowner; (4) To settle the form of government to be set up in Palestine in conjunction with the people of Palestine. Ibn Saud added that he would use his influence to induce the people of Palestine to maintain order and to come to an understanding with the United Kingdom Government, though he considered this point of secondary importance in comparison with the question of Jewish immigration. 18. Ibn Baud s memorandum was communicated to the secretary of the Royal Commission, whose members were invited to regard it as a confidential expression of the views of a ruler who was in a unique position to understand the feelings and beliefs of the Arab world and to speak with authority on behalf of Arab opinion. The Saudi Minister in London was informed orally that His Majesty’s Government much appreciated the friendly tone of the memorandum, and would consider sympathetically all the recommendations which the King had made. He was also informed that His Majesty’s Government considered that the memorandum should be regarded as a confidential diplomatic communication, and that it would not be included among the published evidence submitted to the Royal Commission. 19. Ibn Saud spoke strongly about Palestine in some of the conversations when Mr. Rendel was in Jedda. A few days later he sent to His Majesty’s Minister a document intended to supplement his memorandum. It was based, he said, on information from Palestinian pilgrims (in fact, the Mufti). The W ^ S t0 t ^ le f o ^ 0W i n g effect. The Balfour promise was that the Jews should be given a national home in Palestine, not that the whole of Palestine should be given to them as a national home. Moreover, it was stipulated that no harm should be done to the original Arabs. The Jews who had already emigrated to 1 a lest me could be regarded as the fulfilment of the promise made by Great Britain. If a National Government were organised a treaty could be concluded to safeguard minorities, among them the Jews already in' Palestine, provided that no more Jews should be allowed in and that Arab land should not be allowed to pass into the hands of the Jews. A/r . 20 - According to a statement made to the Foreign Office by the Saud] Minister in London in May, the Palestine Arab delegates wished the Amir Saud who was then in London for the Coronation, to take the lead in making represen tations from all the Arab and Moslem delegates then in London in regard to the future policy of His Majesty s Government in Palestine, but he had said he was in London not for any political purpose but for the Coronation, and that in anv case he could do nothing without consulting his father. No telegram, the Minister said, had been sent to Ibn Baud, because he had instructed the Amir ■r^aud to do nothing without consulting the Foreign Office. It was found that the views of the Minister coincided with those of the Foreign Office as to the uselessness of such a move, the views of Ibn Saud having already been submitted7 [17650] c* 2 to the Royal Commission, which had nearly finished its report: it might even expose the Amir to the accusation of interfering in our internal affairs. The Minister mentioned on this occasion that Ibn Baud had to walk warily in these matters, as he was often accused of being too much in the pocket of the British; but the King was quite prepared to take this risk. 21. Elaborate arrangements were made to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Commission and the conclusions of His Majesty’s Government should reach Ibn Baud before they were published. With the consent of Ibn Baud copies of the report were brought to Jedda from Egypt by two Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and His Majesty's Minister proceeded to Riyadh to see the King on the subject. He reached Riyadh on the 6th July, twenty-four hours before the information was broadcast from Jerusalem. Under the instructions which he had received he was unable to let Ibn Baud believe that discussion of the report would be fruitful, and the King, with his customary practicality of mind, said that if His Majesty’s Government had made up their mind his business was to think of his own interests, and these he considered to be affected very unfavourably by the prospective renunciation of the British mandate over Transjordan. So j long as the mandate lasted, he said, he knew that the Amir Abdullah's intrigues would be held in check, that his claim to Aqaba and Maan would not lapse, and that the tribes would be able to travel without hindrance between Saudi Arabia and Syria. If the Amir was to be independent Ibn Baud wanted Aqaba and Maan, and a corridor, not a mere right of way, to Syria. The possibility that the Amir might acquire an enhanced status evidently annoyed him, and the news that the proposed Arab State might receive a grant of £2 million elicited the comment: “All very well, but don’t let me go bankrupt either.' 22. By the time Sir R. Bullard had reached Hasa Ibn Saud had received telegrams from the Palestine Arabs asking for advice and assistance, and was wanting Fuad Bey, who was travelling with Sir R. Bullard, to suggest a reply. Fuad Bey, though openly hostile personally to the partition proposal, hardly needed the advice of Sir R. Bullard that the Palestine Arabs should not be encouraged to oppose the proposals of His Majesty’s Government, for he knew, as he admitted with obvious regret, that Ibn Saud would never support a policy opposed to that of His Majesty’s Government. In the event a non-committal reply was sent by Ibn Saud, which was in striking contrast to the outburst by the Iraqi Premier, Hikmet Sulaiman. 23. Ibn Saud’s views as to the situation which would arise if His Majesty's Government renounced the mandate over Transjordan were repeated to the Foreign Office at once through the Saudi Minister in London. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was told that, if the King pressed these points, it might lead to consider able difficulty. What would be decided in regard to the Amir Abdullah was not known. Ibn Saud’s views about him were well known to His Majesty’s Govern ment, but the fact remained that he had been very loyal to them, and that they were under certain definite obligations towards him which could not be ignored. As to Aqaba and Maan, that was, unfortunately, one of the few questions where we did not agree with the King’s views. His Majesty’s Government could not accept his claim to those places, which were obviously necessary to the prosperity of Transjordan. As to a corridor to Syria, it might well be answered that it was equally necessary for Transjordan to have a corridor to Iraq. The Foreign Office did not wish to pursue those points for the moment. This was not the end of the matter, for in September, on his way back from seeing Ibn Saud at Riyadh, Sheikh Hafix Wahba stated definitely to His Majesty’s Embassy in Cairo that, if the partition scheme were to come into force, Ibn Saud would lie compelled to demand Aqaba and Maan. 24. It became clear almost immediately after Sir R. Bullard's visit to Riyadh that Ibn Saud’s silence as to the merits of the partition scheme did not mean that he approved of it. That his hand was forced to some extent by the violent opposition which sprang up among the Arabs of Palestine and in other Arab countries is doubtless true, but it is equally true that he detests Zionism and distrusts the Jews, and considers that, in giving way to these forces. His Majesty’s Government are not only acting unfairly towards the Arabs but are compassing their own ruin, and therefore his ruin too. His Minister in London prophesied a bad reception for the report the moment it came out. On the 17th July the Saudi8 Charge d’Affaires called at the Foreign Office to ask on behalf of Ibn Sand whether His Majesty’s Government had determined to adopt the partition scheme without material change, because, if so, it would be very disappointing to him and would place him in a most embarrassing position towards the Arab world. The Arabs had looked to him for advice and help as soon as the report of the Royal Commission had appeared. The Iraq Government had protested strongly against the policy of His Majesty’s Government, whereas he, out of friendship for them and his desire to bring about a general conciliation, had sent an entirely non committal reply. If, however, His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to take any further representations on behalf of the Arabs into account, his position would become most invidious and embarrassing, and he would be regarded by the Arab world as a traitor to the Arab cause. The Charge d’Affaires thought that, in such circumstances, the King could hardly avoid coming out openly against the policy of His Majesty’s Government. Opinion on the question was strong, not only in Palestine and other Arab countries, but in Saudi. Arabia itself, and the King could not ignore it indefinitely. Receiving no encouragement to assume that there would be any serious changes in the scheme recommended by the Royal Commission, he then asked whether, if the King accepted the principle of partition—which it was not certain that he would do—and were to suggest certain modifications designed to remedy what he regarded as injustices to the Arabs, such suggestions would be considered by His Majesty’s Government. He was told that, while the Foreign Office were anxious to avoid raising the hopes of the Arabs unduly, they would always be ready to listen to any suggestions which the King wished to put forward. The Royal Commission’s recommendations and the statement of policy of His Majesty’s Government would, of course, have to be considered by the Permanent Mandates Commission and by the Council of the League, and it was contemplated in the statement of policy that a scheme of partition would then have.to be worked out in detail. It was possible, therefore, that certain changes might be introduced, but, the Foreign Office spokesman repeated, he did not wish to raise Mr. Zada’s hopes unduly. On the 20th August a statement was made by the Foreign Office to the Saudi Minister in reply to further representations by Ibn Saud. It was explained to him that, after the League of Nations had expressed its opinion, an opportunity would be afforded for full examination of the situation with representatives of both Arabs and Jews, and that while His Majesty’s Government still thought that partition on the general lines of the report offered the best hope of solution, there was no reason why the King should not put forward suggestions of his own. They would receive the close attention of His Majesty’s Government, who, however/felt obliged to make it clear that they would have to take into account that they had obligations to Arabs and Jews alike. 25. On the 26th August Sheikh Hafiz Wahba left London for Riyadh on urgent instructions from Ibn Saud, who wished to consult him about the Palestine question and to give him instructions. The following day a representative of the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs brought to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Jedda a message from Ibn Saud to the following effect Sheikh Kamil-al-Qassab, a representative of the National Committee of Palestine and Syria, had arrived at Riyadh a week earlier to find out the views of Ibn Saud and to discuss the holding of an Arab conference in Damascus or Bagdad. Ibn Saud had told him that, in accordance with his invariable policy towards His Majesty’s Government, he had dealt with them direct and had not published his views, which he did not wish to make public. He had explained that negotiations with His Majesty’s Government were in progress, and had persuaded Qassab to abandon the idea of a conference, and also his plan to go to Sana on a similar mission to the Imam. The Secretary of State sent a message of warm appreciation for this information, and an expression of his conviction that the action taken by Ibn Saud would prove to have been in the best interests of all concerned. A fortnight later, however, Ibn Saud sent a letter to the Legation saying that Kamil-al-Qassab had returned to Syria later than had been intended, and that m the interval certain persons who wished a conference to be held had issued invitations and that others from Iraq had agreed: the convenors had apologised to Ibn Saud, saying that they agreed with him and wished to comply with his desire, but the arrangements for the conference had progressed too far to be changed. The conference eventually met at Bludan, in Syria, and passed resolutions showing uncompromising hostility to partition.-• 9 7 &gt; 26. In the interview at the Foreign Office on the 17th July, the Saudi Charge d’Affaires had said that opinion on the subject of Palestine was strong not only in Palestine and other Arab countries, but also in Saudi Arabia. What public opinion in Saudi Arabia thinks on this or any other subject, and what effect it has on Ibn Sand, is a difficult question to resolve. There is no free press; the strong hand of Ibn Saud extends to other things than the maintenance of law and order; and few foreigners are able to mix with any Saudi subjects except those in Jedda, where Arab blood is thin with the dilution of centuries and interest is concentrated on the financial side of the pilgrimage rather than on Arab politics. Moreover, since Ibn Saud smashed the Ikhwan in 1929, it is not easy to think of him as afraid of mere talk. Consequently, when it was reported that public opinion was protesting against the partition proposal, a good deal of scepticism was aroused. Demonstrations which occurred in Jedda were not impressive, and there was some suspicion that demonstrations in other places, followed by telegrams to the King protesting against the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Palestine, were got up in answer to suggestions from the King himself. Demonstrations in autocratic countries are naturally liable to suspicion, but on the other hand it would not be surprising if those parts of Saudi Arabia which are not entirely wrapped up in the pilgrimage should share the sentiments of Arabs elsewhere and should show these feelings when assured that they will not get into trouble for it. Perhaps the most difficult question was to decide to what extent Ibn Saud was telling the truth when he professed to be embarrassed by pressure from the Wahabis and ulema of Neid. As early as the 20th July. Ibn Saud said that the Wahabis of Nejd were raising the strongest objections on religious grounds to acquiescence in the establishment of a Jewish State, and in September Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, on his return to London from seeing Ibn Saud at Riyadh, handed to the Foreign Office copies of a letter from ulema of Nejd to the King and of his reply. The ulema had, they said, been invited by people in Nejd and the Hejaz and in foreign countries to ^ive a fetva (religious ruling) on the question of “ giving to the Jews a land whicn belongs to the Moslems and establishing a Jewish State in Palestine.” They quoted from the Koran and the Traditions of the Prophet to prove that the Jews are the most violent enemies of Islam, and that their attempt to establish a Jewish State was foreseen. To declare a jehad (holy war) was a religious duty and they proposed to raise the flag of jehad, and they had no doubt that Ibn Saud would agree with them. They had heard from trustworthy Moslems that the Jews intended to take Medina, Kheiber and Teima as soon as they were strong enough, but with God’s help this design would be frustrated. In his reply Ibn Saud expressed agreement with the ulema on the question of religious principle and his intention to obey the precepts of his faith at whatever cost to his person and his throne. He had. however, thought it best to make representations to His Majesty’s Government through the diplomatic channels. His friendship with Great Britain was not due to racial or religious ties, obviously, nor to hope of personal gain, but to his belief that there was less to fear from Great Britain than from any other of the great Powers. He therefore begged them to be patient while negotiations were proceeding between His Majesty’s Government and himself and other Arab rulers. If the negotiations succeeded, then God be praised ! If not, then his excuse would be clear to the British Government, as he could not prevent anyone who wished from stating his religious convictions. 27. Accompanying the copies of this correspondence was a memorandum from Ibn Saud giving his views on the situation. While assuring His Majesty’s Government as always of his desire for their friendship he described the Palestine question as a matter of life and death and begged His Majesty’s Government to change their decision about partition. He suggested that they had already fulfilled their promise to the Jews, and described the so-called exchange of populations as an “ unprecedented clearing-out ” of the Arabs from the Jewish zone. He suggested as the basis of a final settlement:— (1) The establishment of a constitutional Government in Palestine in which the present population w^ould be represented proportionally, with guarantees for minorities, the Holy Places, the maintenance of justice and the interests of Great Britain. [17650] c* 310 (2) The regulation of Jewish immigration so that the present percentage of Jews to the total population should never be exceeded. (3) The adoption of measures to prevent the Arabs from being deprived ot their lands. 28. When handing in these documents Sheikh Hafiz Wahba said that he had found the King almost desperate over the question of Palestine. Feeling in Arab countries was running high and his position was becoming increasing y difficult. The King did not wish to appear to threaten, but he could not guarantee that he would be able to keep his tribes in check indefinitely. Distances w® 1 e n 1 ea l and the control of the frontier was always difficult. If, however, 1 bn baud learned that any of his tribesmen were contemplating action which he could not control, he would at least undertake to give His Majesty’s Government any possible information in advance. 29. Just as the public demonstrations in Jedda were not violent, so the local press kept its criticisms within reasonable bounds. A Central Committee for the Defence of Palestine was, however, formed in Mecca, with branches elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, the president being a well-known Arab scholar of Jedda, Muhammad Nasif. Being invited by the corresponding committee in Syria to send a resolution for communication to the Bludan Conference they telegraphed : “ Resolved that all Arabs and Moslems are dissatisfied with the decision about the partition of Palestine and protested against it. Palestine is Arab, and no Arab or Moslem can do anything but protest against that^ unjust decision. We join with the Arabs of Palestine in disapproving of it. The Mecca Committee, however, did not send delegates to the conference, alleging as a reason that the invitation to do so was received only two days before the date fixed for the opening of the conference. The long list that was eventually published showing the names of all those who took part in the conference included only one delegate described as being from Saudi Arabia, and he was a Jedda piece-goods merchant in a small way, a man of Syrian descent and peihaps Syrian nationality who was presumably self-elected. 30. It was natural that many Arab Nationalists should wish that any conference held to discuss Palestine should be held in Mecca. It seems ceitain, however, that Ibn Saud has resolutely declined to allow Mecca to be used for this purpose. Information to this effect was conveyed to His Majesty’s Government by the Saudi Legation in London in January. The reply given to Sheikh Kamil- al-Qassab has been mentioned already. Later in the year Lgyptian and other Arabic newspapers printed a story that Ibn Saud had refused to allow a geneial Arab conference to be held in Mecca out of deference to the feelings of Great Britain This was denied in an inspired article published in the Mecca Umm-al- Q U ra, but, as the King said to His Majesty’s Minister soon afterwards, there was some foundation for the story nevertheless. 31. It was not only in his refusal to allow Mecca to be used as a meeting- place for a congress on Palestine that the policy of Ibn Saud was of value to His Majesty’s Government. His refusal to allow Faudhi Qawuqji to stay in Saudi Arabia was mentioned last year, and all the evidence goes to show that far from wishing his tribes to profit by the unrest in Palestine that followed the publication of the report of the Royal Commission, he used his influence to keep them quiet. The authorities in Transjordan had some suspicion, in the autumn, that some hostile move from Saudi Arabia was contemplated—a suspicion which was strengthened bv a rumour that arms had been landed on the shore of the Gulf of Aqaba and by the attitude of some of the Saudi frontier officials. In the end no move was made and the suspicion died down. I he rumour of the landing of arms received no confirmation from any source, and it seemed to His Majesty’s Minister that any Saudi activity observable on the Transjordan frontier could be attributed to the normal policy of “feeling for’’ the exact line of the frontier, the slow increase of the number of regular troops there as elsewhere, the arrival of arms from stocks supplied to Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Government, and the greater truculence of Saudi officials resulting partly from excitement about Palestine and partly from a feeling of triumph over their successful occupation of certain points, e.g., Tutun, without challenge[17650] c* 4 11 from the 1 ransjordan authorities. A member of the Legation staff, who spent’ three months in Riyadh at the critical time when the tribes were coming in for j their subsidies, saw no signs of excitement or of warlike preparation, and the news received in Koweit, where tribal information is plentiful, went to show that in his talks with the tribes Ibn Baud did not stir them up about Palestine but calmed them down and ordered them to keep the peace. 32. A scheme was devised by the Transjordan authorities in March to be put into effect in the case of trouble in Palestine, which would control closely all traffic from Iraq into Palestine by way of Transjordan. In forwarding this scheme to His Majesty’s Government the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan pointed out that it would be rendered much more effective if traffic from Iraq to Transjordan through Kaf could also he controlled, and suggested that the Saudi Government should be asked to agree in principle that if the situation should require the adoption of such a measure they would prevent the passage from the Kaf area into Transjordan of all persons coming from Iraq except bona fide merchants and migrating tribes. To this proposal the Foreign Office saw more than one objection. Any such request, they thought, might suggest to Ibn Baud that His Majesty’s Government expected the occurrence of events such as would only be likely to result from the adoption of a policy of the very kind which he was deprecating, while any attempt to extract a promise of such co-operation might be offensive to him as implying either that we doubted his good faith and his intention to remain a good neighbour, or that we took his co-operation for granted irrespective of whatever policy we might adopt in regard to Palestine. They therefore informed the Colonial Office that, while recognising that such representations might eventually be necessary, the Secretary of State would prefer not to make any such representa tions for the time being even though that might involve some loss of time in the event of a further outbreak of disturbances. 33. In spite of the restraint which Ibn Baud exercised over himself and his people, he continued until the end of the year to express his dislike of the partition proposal, and his fear lest the Zionist policy should involve His Majesty’s Government, and therefore himself, in ruin. When His Majesty’s Minister, in an interview in December, employed the familiar arguments in favour of partition, especially the argument that a limitation by territory would be more stable and more likely to be final than a limitation by population, the King said that, on the contrary, the creation of a separate Jewish State would be a perpetual irritant and source of danger. But he seemed unable to believe that partition would ever be effected. 34. At the interview in December Ibn Baud seemed to suffer from a minor apprehension lest His Majesty’s Government should adopt a scheme put up by some other person or Government and thus damage his prestige. He was particularly suspicious about a scheme he had heard of, under which His Majesty’s Government would order a stoppage of Jewish immigration and would hand Palestine over to the Iraq Government, who would then, as part of the bargain, throw Palestine open to unrestricted immigration by Jews. His suspicion was directed particularly against Nuri Pasha, who had, in fact, submitted to His Majesty’s Government a scheme for Palestine some time before, though not on those lines. Sir R. Bullard’s conviction, which he expressed to the King, that His Majesty’s Government would continue to repay his frankness by equal frank ness, and would never take any serious decision on the subject of Palestine without giving him the earliest possible notice, was supported by the action of His Maiesty's Government shortly afterwards, when they sent to Jedda advance information, to be conveyed to Ibn Baud before the date of publication, of the white paper of the 5th January, 1938, defining their attitude towards the partition proposal. Ti'ansjordan. 35. The frontier relations between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan continued to be good. The practice of sending written protests was reduced to reasonable proportions. One indignant protest made in January, alleging that a Transjordan patrol had violated the Saudi frontier, died away when His Majesty’s Minister wrote enquiring from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs whether an attempt tosettle the matter direct between the frontier authorities of the two Governments had been made, and reiterating the obvious advantages of this pioceduie advantages which Fuad Bey, who had apparently not been consulted befoic the protest was sent in, admitted with emphasis. In only two other cases were protests received. In one there had, in fact, been a violation of the frontier by a Transjordan car patrol, owing to the development of a defect in the compass of the accompanying aeroplane and to the pilot’s ignorance of the country, but the error had been discovered speedily and the cars withdrawn, and suitable explanations, apologies and assurances for the future had already been conveyed through Major Glubb to the Saudi Inspector-General of Frontiers. The other protest was against the presence of a Transjordan patrol at a place called hharia which was described as half an hour to the north of lutun. The Transjordan authorities believe that the point in question is in Transjordan, but did not wish at the present moment to insist on their point, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs were informed by the Legation that the patrol had been withdrawn. Saudi insistence in this matter is probably attributable to the fact that they had been allowed to occupy Tutun, as to whose ownership they had been doubtful, without opposition from Transjordan. But their note was composed in very reasonable language; it argued that the Transjordan post there was an innovation, and suggested that no innovations should be permitted pending a settlement of the frontier question. 36. Three questions of importance are dealt with elsewhere :— (1) Transjordan Frontier Survey : paragraph 93. (2) Fear lest the disorders in Palestine might lead to aggression from Saudi Arabia against Transjordan: paragraph 31. (3) The revival of Ibn Saud’s claim to Aqaba and Maan and to a corridor to Syria, in connexion with the recommendation of the Royal Gom- mission on Palestine that the mandate over Transjordan should be terminated : paragraph 21. 37. In March the Officer Commanding the Desert Area managed at last to bring about a meeting with the Saudi Frontier Inspector, Abdul Aziz-bin-Zaid (paragraph 21 of 1936). It was a satisfactory meeting but for the fact that the inspector began by presenting a list of twenty-four outstanding cases, ranging from alleged violations of the frontier by armoured cars to an eleven-year-old debt for 20 dollars, and including several raid cases ‘ ‘ buried ' ’ by the Bon- Voisinage Treaty of 1933. However, this list was perhaps compiled to justify the semi-diplomatic appointment which the inspector holds. As Major Glubb remarked in this connexion : “ Things are now so amicable on this frontier that professional diplomats must be hard pressed for an occupation.' The Saudi Government subsequently informed His Majesty’s Minister that they considered to be still alive two claims which Major Glubb had held at the meeting to have been “ buried ” in accordance with the Bon-Voisinage Agreement, but the detailed reply on this subject from Transjordan, which the Legation communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in August, was apparently convincing, for nothing more was heard about the two cases. 38. A troublesome subject which was discussed at the meeting in March, was the tendency of the Saudi authorities to reopen cases which have been dealt with by the judicial authorities in Transjordan and been the subject of a final judgment there, if the parties subsequently find themselves in Saudi Arabia. An 'additional complication is that the legal systems of the two countries are entirely different. Saudi Arabia uses the Moslem law (Shara’), though the Amirs often hive arbitrary decisions according to expediency, common sense or greed, whereas the Transjordan nomads are dealt with by tribal customary law (different from the Shara’), and non-nomads by civil courts based on the European law. The only conclusion reached by the negotiators was that an attempt should be made to secure more frequent consulation, if necessary by wireless. 39 Although relations were very good that does not mean that the Saudi officials always 'acted with complete propriety. Thus the Amir of Tebuk imprisoned three Beni Ataiya accused of stealing three camels from the Beni Sakhr in Transjordan, but apparently did nothing towards the recovery of the stolen animals. On the other hand, Major Glubb has often great difficulty in dealing[17650] d* 13 with acts of aggression against Nejd merchants. This arises partly from the fact that many of them cross Transjordan with large flocks on their way to Egypt or Palestine. If one or two camels, out of a flock of a hundred or more, are stolen, it is not worth the merchant’s while to stop, and if he lodges a complaint it is three months later after his return to Hail or Jauf. The Saudi Frontier Inspector has been asked by Major Glubb to warn all Saudi merchants of the importance of making an immediate complaint to the nearest Transjordan police post. It appears, however, that many Nejdi merchants avoid all posts when entering Transjordan, often travelling by night to elude the customs and passport controls. If they reported any thefts to the police, the fact that they were engaged in smuggling would become known. They therefore prefer to demand reparation through diplomatic channels on their return to their own country. 40. At the time of the conclusion of the Treaty of Friendship and Bon- Voisinage between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan, it was decided that the Command Paper to be published should contain only the treaty and the schedule of rules mentioned in article 7 of the treaty, and not the text of certain letters exchanged at the time. This agreement was observed on the British side, but in February 1937 the Transjordan Government, acting under the misapprehension that the omission to publish these letters was an error requiring rectification, published the texts in the Transjordan Official Gazette. The High Commissioner feared that this might cause some friction with the Saudi Government, but it was pointed out by the Foreign Office that the texts in question, with the exception of a list of the Beni ’Atiya, had appeared in the Umm-al-Qura, the nearest approach to an Official Gazette in Saudi Arabia, in December 1933. 41. A special reconnaissance was carried out in Transjordan between Mudawwara and the eastern end of Jabal Tubaik, to discover whether an alternative oar track further to the north could be found. The High Commis sioner for Transjordan reported that no suitable alternative track existed. He believed that for that reason and also because the de facto car track had always been used and the Saudi authorities had acquiesced in its use, the proposal to use some other track should be dropped. The Colonial Office, after examining this report, wrote to the Foreign Office saying that it was proposed to reply abandoning for the present the suggestion that an alternative provisional line should be laid down. 42. The Saudi Government again brought forward a request which it had been found impossible to grant a year or two before, that merchants bringing Saudi imports (usually cattle or cooking-butter) into Transjordan should be given time to sell enough to pay the customs dues. They suggested various methods by which they considered this could be made possible, but the Transjordan authorities decided that to give effect to the proposal would be impracticable under present conditions. The Acting High Commissioner of Transjordan added, however, that in a revised Customs Law then under consideration it was intended to make provision for the extension of facilities for the payment of customs dues at places other than the place of entry. The Yemen. 43. General relations between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen remained good. The object of the mission of Saiyid Muhammad Zabara was never made public (paragraph 32 of 1936), but it was noted that few Yemenis other than the Royal party to be mentioned hereafter made the pilgrimage. Early in the year Saiyid Abdullah-al-Wazir went to Jizan and met there the Saudi Amir of Jizan, and they apparently came to an agreement on the boundary question. A quarrel between Saudi and Yemeni subjects about the division of the water supply at Haradh led to some feeling and lasted about six months, but it was at last settled, Abdullah-al-Wazir again being the Yemeni delegate. 44. Three of the sons of the Imam came on the pilgrimage : Abdullah. Husain and Qasim. They were .accompanied by Abdullah-al-Wazir and other Yemeni notables. Owing to some misunderstanding or delay they were not met by Saudi officials on arrival, but the Saudi authorities did their best to atone for the mishap. The Princes were treated with Royal honours; they were the guests of the King, and were kept close to him on all public occasions.14 45. The fears about the Yemen which Ibn Saud communicated to the Foreign Office at the end of last year (pargaraph 33 of 1936) were again spoken of during Mr. Eendel’s visit. The Yemen, the King said, was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent, Ahmad, and the Foreign Minister, a Turk named Raghib, who was in Italian pay. When the Imam’s sons had been in Mecca for the pilgrimage, one of them, Saif-ul-Islam Husain, had asked Ibn Sand’s advice about the situation : if there was a revolt in the Yemen what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? The malcontents, the Prince said, had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They had sent the Imam a written protest, but without effect. If they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and Ahmad, and the Imam, too, if he opposed this popular movement. To this enquiry from Saiyid Husain, Ibn Saud had replied, he said, that he himself proposed to observe complete neutrality and non-intervention in Yemeni affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be trouble in the Yemen the most he could do would be to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. 46. The record of what was said about Italy and the Yemen in the course of the Rendel conversations will be found in paragraphs 78, 79, 80 and 89. 47. Ibn Saud informed His Majesty’s Minister in December that after the conclusion of the Italo-Yemen Treaty a few months before he had written to the Imam asking whether there was anything behind the treaty. The Imam had assured him that there was not, and Ihn Saud accepted this statement, knowing the Imam to be a wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 48. The Iraq Government acted upon their intention (paragraph 31 of 1936) to write to the King of the Yemen on the subje'ct of his adhesion to the Iraqi- Saudi Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance. In his reply the King evinced the friendliest sentiments and his entire approval of the general purpose of the treaty, but expressed reluctance to adhere to it because of the manner in which its provisions were conditioned by the Covenant of the League of Nations and other international instruments. He considered that it was unnecessary for his foreign policy to have a wider aim than peace and friendship with the rest of the Arab world, and for this reason he thought it inexpedient to become entangled in the complications of League politics. He therefore proposed that Iraq and the Yemen should conclude a new treaty on the lines of the Iraqi-Saudi Arabia Treaty of April 1936, but without any reference to Iraq’s other treaties or to the League of Nations. If this were done, he would be willing to use his influence to persuade Ibn Saud to sign the treaty, too. 49. The Iraq Government then decided to send a mission to the Yemen to try to overcome the King’s objections. His Majesty’s Government uttered a warning lest the Iraq Government should accept any proposed Yemeni reserva tions without close scrutiny. The Yemen, they said, was in the same position as Saudi Arabia with regard to the League of Nations and the Anglo-Iraq Alliance, and references appropriate for the Saudi Arabian Government should be appropriate for the Government of the Yemen. The delegation called at Jedda on the way to the Yemen and visited Ibn Saud at Mecca. They had instructions from their Government to invite the Imam to adhere to the treaty either without reservations or with suitable reservations excluding the Yemen from the applica tion of the Covenant of the League of Nations and any other international instrument referred to in the treaty which the King might dislike. Ihn Saud sent a grumble to His Majesty’s Minister, saying that he was bound by article 17 of the Covenant and by the Kellogg Pact, and thought it hard that Iraq should be moie generous to the Yemen than to him—though he had forborne to say so to the Iraq mission. This is, of course, inaccurate. It is Iraq that is bound by the Co\enant and by the Kellogg Pact, and Saudi Arabia is only affected in that she cannot expect Iraq to take any action under the treaty that is contrary to the latter’s obligations under those two international instruments The Foreign Office examined carefully the reservations which the Iraq mission was to put before the Imam and found them not unsatisfactory, but pointed out that if Ibn Saud accepted any reservations sub silentio he would be taken to have agreed to them.2 L 15 By this time, however, the King of the Yemen had already signed an instrument, a copy of which the Iraq mission communicated to the Saudi Government on their way home, and the Saudi Government to His Majesty’s Minister. It was noticed at once that the King had not adhered to the treaty with reservations, but had made many changes, and in particular had cut out article 4 (c) altogether, thereby taking on obligations which he could have escaped by acceptance of the sub-article, which defines certain acts as not acts of aggression. But the whole instrument had been so thoroughly altered by the Imam as to constitute a new treaty. The Saudi Government also came to the conclusion that the treaty was a new instrument, but they ratified it nevertheless. It was then hailed in the Saudi press as a gesture of pan-Arab significance. 50. The ratification as between the Yemen and Saudi Arabia was effected by a Saudi envoy, Muhammad Shaikho, who went to Sana for the purpose. He also concluded on behalf of Saudi Arabia two other agreements :— (1) An agreement, dated the 2nd November, 1937, for the settlement of disputes. This is the official title. The instrument is really a frontier agreement, and provides for the passage of local residents across the border, as well as for the settlement of disputes between subjects of the two States living in the frontier regions. (2) An annex to the Treaty of .Taif defining the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 51. A Saudi-Yemen agreement which did not come to the notice of the Legation at Jedda at the time may also be mentioned here, viz., an arbitration covenant which was signed on the 6th Safar, 1353 (the 20th May, 1934). A den Protectorate. 52. There is even less to record this year than in 1936. The only item calling for mention is Mr. Philby’s defence of his action in entering the Aden Protectorate from Saudi territory without notice (paragraph 6 of 1936). He returned, as was expected, entirely unrepentant. He said that Ibn Saud w T as in no way responsible for his expedition, to which that of Bertram Thomas, he considered, afforded an exact parallel. He was unable to see that he had treated Ibn Saud badly in obtaining an escort for topographical work and exploration in Saudi Arabia and using it, unknown to his patron, to enter territory outside Saudi Arabia. He did not deny that he knew Shabwa to be far soiiih of the extreme demands of the Saudi Government, but his attitude was that the claim of the Aden authorities to Shabwa was a trespass on territory which was abandoned by His Majesty’s Government in favour of Arab independence in the McMahon correspondence. He had intended nevertheless to dismiss the Hadhramaut in one uncontroversial chapter in his forthcoming book, but, having been “ attacked ” by Aden, he intended to “ fight back.” 53. The Sheikh of Shabwa came on the pilgrimage, and while in Mecca stayed with Mr. Philby, who wished, it appears, to return in some measure the hospitality and help afforded him in Shabwa. Mr. Philby represents the sheikh as replying to advances from the King of the Yemen: “First there came Faisal-al-Saud, and now Philby (i.e., Ibn Saud) has come, and we don’t want anyone else.” This may prove that Mr. Philby went log-rolling for Ibn Saud in the Aden Protectorate, but it does not prove that Ibn Saud wished him to do so. There is no suggestion from any quarter that Ibn Saud tries to insinuate his influence into those parts. Nor is it likely that he would encourage the Sheikh of Shabwa, or any other ruler within British-protected territory/to oppose the policy of His Majesty’s Government. 54. The question of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Aden Protectorate is dealt with elsewhere (paragraph 94). Muscat and Oman. 55. The record is blank this year, except for the question of the frontier, which is dealt with elsewhere. It is evident to His Majesty’s Legation that there16 is little contact between Saudi Arabia and Oman and/or Muscat. 1 he Saudi Government hardly pretend to have any knowledge of what goes on in the debatable land, or of where the frontier is. Trucial Sheikhs and Q.atar. 56. A three-cornered dispute which centred upon Zubara, at the north of the Qatar Peninsula, was not without interest to Saudi Arabia. The affair began in April in an attempt by the Sheikh of Qatar to compel the Naim tribe living at Zubara to declare their loyalty to him. The Sheikh of Bahrein has an ancient claim to Zubara, and the Naim are reported to have said that if they did not receive support from the sheikh they would “adhere to Ibn Sand. I he Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the Governor of Hasa had recently sent a party of seventy camelmen towards Qatar for some purpose unknown, but he did not think that they would enter Qatar territory. He was of the opinion that His Majesty’s Government should not interfere if the Naim emigrated to Saudi territory, but he asked His Majesty’s Minister whether he could ascertain to what extent the Saudi Government were interested or involved in the situation. 57. His Majesty’s Minister replied that he shared the opinion of the Political Resident that the Naim should be allowed to emigrate to Saudi Arabia if they wanted to. He also thought it unlikely that the party from Hasa would enter Qatar territory. In view of the general attitude of Ibn Saud and of the warnings given to him about Qatar, Sir R. Bullard did not think that he would allow his tribes to interfere even with Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid, still less with a tribe in the extreme north of Qatar Peninsula, though doubtless he would be glad if a Qatar tribe took refuge with him and possibly the tribe had ascertained from the Governor of Hasa that they would be welcome. To ascertain to what extent the Saudi Government were interested was, however, hardly possible at the moment: there was no Foreign Affairs official at Jedda at the time, and to deal with the matter in writing or to ask for an official to be sent down from Taif would invest the question with an importance which the vagueness of the enquiry would hardly warrant. He suggested that as we had no ground to suspect underhand dealing by Ibn Saud or his officials we should assume that their conduct was correct and say nothing to them about the matter for the present. 58. The dispute ended in July when Sheikh Rashid of the Naim entered into an agreement with the Sheikh of Qatar to obey him as long as he resided in, Qatar. There was, however, some fighting first, and Fuad Bey referred to this when he and His Majesty’s Minister were at Hasa on their way from Riyadh to Uqair. Fuad Bey received a telegram from Bahrein which apparently spoke of the fighting and 'mentioned rather high casualties, and he made some vague remark to Sir R. Bullard to the effect that he wondered whether the King could be of use in bringing about peace—apparently between Qatar and Bahrein. It was all very vague and tentative and Sir R. Bullard gave a discouraging reply which precluded pursuit of the subject, but it showed that Ibn Saud was interested. On the other hand, there was no evidence whatever that there had been any Saudi interference in the case, or even that Fuad Bey’s vague soundings were authorised. 59. According to a report received by the Political Agent at Bahrein the Zubara question was mentioned in a conversation between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Amir Saud during the latter’s visit to the sheikh, and the Amir said that, after all, the A1 Thani (the ruling family of Qatar) were “ no better than animals.” This feeling of contempt for the Sheikh of Qatar doubtless helps to exacerbate the bitterness with which Ibn Saud asserts his claim to Jabal Nakhsh. 60. For the frontier question, see paragraph 94. Bahrein. 61. Relations between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia have improved out of recognition since the agreement about customs dues, &amp;c., was concluded little more than two years ago. In December the Amir Saud paid a visit to Bahrein, and the handsome reception he received from his Highness the sheikh created the17 [17650] d* 3 best possible impression upon Ibn Baud, who resolved to return the compliment with interest when the sheikh should reach Jedda for the pilgrimage which he was about to embark upon at the end of the year. The King remarked to Sir R. Bullard, with regard to the approaching visit, that the sheikh was a very good man, and, moreover, like himself, of Aneyza origin. Meanwhile, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, having ascertained from the Legation that the Sheikh of Bahrein was now addressed by the British authorities as “your Highness,” announced that the Saudi Government would of course do the same, and moreover would give him a salute of twenty-one guns. 62. Ibn Saud’s respect for the Sheikh of Bahrein may have been increased by the discovery which the Amir Saud is believed to have made during his visit there, that the A1 Khalifa family are not held down by the British in a position of inferiority in Bahrein, without prestige or power, as he had frequently heard from other sources. 63. Certain legislation promulgated in Bahrein in 1937 was examined carefully in the light of its probable effect upon Bahrein-Saudi relations. This legislation, which was prompted by Iranian legislation under which Bahreinis in Iran suffer certain disabilities, consisted of (1) a Bahrein Nationality Law combined with (2) a Law regarding Ownership of Immovable Property in Bahrein by Foreigners. The latter provides that foreigners in Bahrein whose Governments prohibit in their respective territories the ownership of immovable property by persons other than their own nationals, may be prohibited from owning such property in Bahrein except within the limits required for their residence, trade or craft; and that the Bahrein Government may from time to time notify the Governments whose nationals in Bahrein will be subjected to this prohibition. The question was to decide whether the Bahrein Government should notify the Saudi Government under this second law. 64. The annual report for 1934 (paragraph 174) explained the position of the foreigner in Saudi Arabia in regard to the ownership of real property. “ Important regulations .... reaffirmed the old principle that foreigners must not hold real property in the Hejaz, as distinct from the rest of Saudi Arabia.” His Majesty’s Minister could not find that there was one single Bahreini in the Hejaz : the one person of Bahreini origin known to the Legation was regarded by the Saudi authorities as a Saudi subject and had recently travelled on a Saudi passport. Sir R. Bullard had no information about the number (if any) of Bahreinis owning land in Nejd and of Saudis owning land in Bahrein, but on general principles he deprecated the application to Saudis in Bahrein of the Bahrein Law on Ownership of Immovable Property by Foreigners in Bahrein. It was true, he said, that it seemed probable that any Bahreinis domiciled in the Hejaz refrained, as did the Hadhramis, on grounds of expediency and con venience, from making use of their Bahreini nationality; but whereas he under stood that Bahreinis in Iran complained of bad treatment from the Iranian authorities, there was no evidence that any Bahreinis in Saudi Arabia ever complained of the treatment to which they were subjected by the Saudi Govern ment. He was against any action which might appear to discriminate against Saudi subjects, since the relevant Saudi legislation was more generous that that of Iran; and he expressed the hope that any decision affecting the Saudi Govern ment might be taken on its merits and not merely in order to avoid giving the Iranian Government the impression that they had been singled out for special treatment. 65. The Political Agent at Bahrein reported that according to the Bahrein Government no Bahrein subjects were known to own real property in Saudi Arabia, but that there were a number of Saudi subjects in Bahrein who would be seriously aflected should Arabia be “ notified ” under the new law. The Political Agent was of the opinion that Saudi Arabia did not fulfil the conditions of that law, and in view of that fact, and of the desire of the Bahrein Government not to “ notify ” the Saudi Government, he considered that it would be impolitic to do so. This attitude was approved by His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabian Government was not “ notified.” 66. For the Zubara question, see paragraph 56.18 Koweit. (j/. The Koweit “ blockade ' had not been raised by the end of the year. The conflicting theses had, however, been brought nearer together, and there seemed some hope of a settlement. To follow all the steps ot the negotiations would be tedious. In the hope of allaying Saudi fears that goods nominally destined for Iraq might, after leaving Koweit, be smuggled into Saudi territory, His Majesty’s Minister, under instructions from the Foreign Office, informed Fuad Bey that the Sheikh of Koweit was quite willing to enter into an anti smuggling agreement with Iraq, but wished to complete the discussions with the Saudi Government first and to get the scheme working on that side, and His Majesty’s Government agreed that it would be simplest and most expeditious to take one step at a time and recommended that course strongly. The subject was discussed during Mr. Rendel’s visit in March, and Sheikh Yusuf Tasin, who was acting for Fuad Bey, was then in his most unyielding mood. To justify his intransigence he declared that one-third of the revenue of Hasa was lost owing to smuggling from Koweit, and he added in private that the great obstacle was Ibn Sand’s knowledge that smuggling from Koweit was effected under the control of the Sheikh himself, who made a profit out of it. He also stated that the smuggling was so bad that Ibn Saud had recently imposed the death penalty on smugglers on several occasions. The written protest from Ibn Saud about the Arab territories of the Persian Gulf, and, in particular, his reference to Bahrein and Koweit (paragraph 71), might be read as the admission of a desire to strangle the trade of his neighbours in order to divert trade to Saudi ports, and at one interview, when His Majesty’s Minister referred to the advantages which might be expected from a restoration of normal trade, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin declared that trade via Koweit was not in the least necessary to Saudi Arabia. Another serious difficulty arose when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that he had taken for granted that an Agreement for Friendship and Bon-Voisinage and an Extradition Agreement would come into force simultaneously with the restoration of trade relations. It is true that this point had been mentioned in a letter which he addressed to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires on the 17th August, 1936, but the passage about the other agreements had been read as meaning that these ought to be discussed when the trade agreement had come into force. Eventually some, at least, of the difficulties were smoothed away. The Saudi Government dropped their proposals that caravans should be accom panied by officials and only leave on fixed days, and that no Beduin should be allowed to make purchases unless he had a Saudi permit for that purpose, but held to their contention that all retail purchasers bound for Saudi Arabia should leave Koweit in parties and observe the procedure devised for caravans. On the other hand, the fears expressed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the proposal to link the two other agreements with the trade agreement would be unpalatable to the Sheikh and would delay the negotiations, proved to be unfounded. His Highness agreed to the proposal in principle, and accepted the latest Saudi draft of the agreement as amended in London by the departments concerned. At the end of the year the reply to this effect which was sent to the Saudi Arabian Government by His Majesty’s Legation with the amended draft agreement had been approved in principle bv the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and was being examined by the Ministry of Finance. 68. In December it was reported that this year nearly the whole of the Awazim tribe had been permitted by Ibn Saud to enter Koweit territory, where a certain number of that tribe go every winter, in order to find better grazing than the poor rainfall had provided in their own “ dira.' As the Political Agent at Koweit pointed out, this permission involves leave to make purchases in the Koweit market. 69. It is known that Ibn Saud regrets the inability (due, it is believed, to financial considerations) of his Highness the Sheikh of Koweit to perform the pilgrimage. The ordinary pilgrims from Koweit are increasing in number. It was particularly noticed in December that many more litters were preparing for the journey than in the year before. This increase was attributed to the continued security on the pilgrim road. 70. The Saudi Government approached His Majesty’s Legation for the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the possibility of prospecting for oil19 £17650] d* 4 in the Koweit Neutral Zone. The details may be left for the economic report, but it may be mentioned here that Ibn Saud tied his hands some time ago by selling the option of his oil rights in that zone to the California Standard Oil Company, who do not seem anxious to take any further action, and that on the other hand, the Sheikh of Koweit has been known to say that on the death of Ibn Saud he hopes to resume the half-share in the Neutral Zone which he considers was wrongfully conceded to Ibn Saud by his British mentors when he was too young to protest. Frontiers: Relations with the Persian Gulf Rulers generally. 71. Ibn Saud’s enquiry whether the Arab amirates in the Persian Gulf could adhere to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance is mentioned in paragraph 85 below. His acceptance of the position, as explained by Mr. Rendel, did not prevent his complaining that he was hemmed in by those amirates (para graph 82). He sent in a very strong note on this point, and said with some bitterness that he had never thought this could be “ a reason for taking away a part of our territories and annexing it to those territories at a time when everyone admits that the peace which those places enjoy is due to God and to us.” He also protested against the use of ports on the Persian Gulf less important than his and at being left at the mercy of Koweit and Bahrein, and at being fobbed off with the reply that this was a matter for the shipping companies. Even had this protest of the King’s been quite accurate, which it was not, it was impossible to do much about the complaint, the situation being due to historical developments which could not be reversed; so no direct reply was returned. 72. In spite of this protest, and of his declaration, as a background to his claim to Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid (paragraph 94) that all the coast used to belong to his ancestors and the present rulers would not deny it, Ibn Saud made no attempt to act upon this large assumption. There is no evidence of any attempt to interfere in the coastal amirates, with the possible exception of the case of Baraimi, about which there is, however, nothing definite. The King did his best to enhance, not to diminish, the status of the Sheikh of Bahrein, whose translation in 1937 to the rank of “ Highness ” he accepted and even, in the matter of salutes, improved upon. Nothing will increase his respect for the Sheikh of Qatar, but at least he no longer tries to influence him by direct correspondence. For the Sheikh of Koweit he professes the most friendly feelings, though these have not yet been turned into the raising of the “ blockade.” (B) With Powers outside Arabia. General. 73. The tendency to treat foreigners ” on a basis of reciprocity ” becomes more marked, and that phrase even crept into a regulation (on the residence of foreigners in Saudi Arabia) which, however, was not published until the beginning of 1938. When a Greek grocer died in Jedda the authorities took possession of his shop and would not permit the French Legation, who are entrusted with Greek affairs, to intervene in any way. The three large industrial concerns operating in the country were squeezed in two ways : they were expected to perform services for the Saudi Government that lay outside the terms of their concessions, and they had to make (though this was in accordance with the terms of their concessions) heavy payments in gold in respect of guards and other employees who were of doubtful value and who certainly did not receive from their Government the sums paid for their services. This squeezing policy was applied in a Workmen’s Compensation Regulation which fixed compensation for employees injured or killed in the service of any such company at rates far higher than the Saudi Government would ever pay, if they paid anything. There was an instance of discrimination against foreigners in a regulation which exempts Saudi subjects, but not foreign residents, from the Koshan tax during the four slack months of the year for the journey from Jedda to Mecca (7s.) or Jedda to Medina (£3 8s.). The position in international law was, however, found to be vague, and the Foreign Office could only instruct His Majesty’s Minister to make unofficial representations on the subject if a suitable opportunity should occur. After an interval of several years two lists appeared in the press giving the' 20 names of persons stated to have acquired Saudi nationality. The original nationality was not given, but most of them appeared to be of Hadhramaut origin, the next categories in order of numerical importance being Africans and Indians. 74. On several occasions pan-Arab sentiments were expressed by Saudi personalities or in the Mecca press, e.g., when the King of the Yemen ratified his adhesion to his version of the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance, when a fund was raised in Saudi Arabia for victims of the floods in Syria, and when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin spoke at a banquet in Syria. But in spite of the formation in Saudi Arabia of branches of the Palestine Defence Committee, there was not much pan-Arabism in practice. Not only did Ibn Saud refuse to allow a conference about Palestine to be held in Mecca, but no Saudi delegate attended the conference which was held (apparently against his will) in Bludan. There is no doubt that Ibn Saud is a sincere Moslem and proud of his Arab descent, but he does not allow his attachment to his religion to dim his keen political vision, and his pride in his descent helps to check rather than to intensify his pan-Arab feelings, since it prevents his joining in movements set on foot by smaller men, often of less pure Arab origin, in other Arab countries. 75. Derogations from the law are made in favour of non-Moslem foreigners in two respects : individuals are allowed to bring in gramophones, and important firms are permitted to import fixed quantities of alcoholic liquor for their personal consumption. On the other hand, foreign Moslems who choose to live in the sacred territory in and around Mecca are compelled to wear beards. British Commonwealth of Nations. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 76. The opening sentence of this section in the 1936 report applies accurately to 1937 : “ Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Arabian Government in (1937) centred mainly round two questions, viz., relations with Italy and the troubles in Palestine.’' Ibn Sand’s suspicion and fear of Italian policy increased, and strengthened his tendency to look to His Majesty’s Government for sympathy and support, in spite of his hostility to their policy in Palestine. Personal relations were excellent. Various causes of friction, in particular the slavery question, had been cleared out of the way, and one—the frontier on the east—did not become acute until just after the end of the year. The Amir Saud’s visit to England for the Coronation of His Majesty King George VI, for which he travelled as far as Suez on H.M.S. Londonderry, and the Coronation festivities in Jedda, afforded opportunities for the display of feelings which seemed to be genuinely friendly. These feelings were expressed in the autumn in a present of four Arab horses for His Majesty the King and four camels for the London Zoo. A visit paid to this country by Mr. and Mrs. Rendel in the spring was pleasing to Ibn Saud because it enabled him to return in some measure the hospitality which his two eldest sons had enjoyed in the United Kingdom on various occasions, and because, although the visit was private, it enabled him to exchange views with an official of the Foreign Office on matters of common interest. Ibn Saud also appreciated the action of His Majesty’s Government in sending their Minister to Riyadh in July to communicate to him in advance the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine. In the autumn he again had British visitors : he entertained at Riyadh for some days an old friend, Colonel Dickson, formerly Political Agent at Koweit, and Mrs. Dickson. Finally, towards the end of the year, the King learned with very great satisfaction that Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone were thinking seriously of acting upon an invitation from the Amir Saud, now confirmed by His Majesty, to visit Saudi Arabia. 77. Sir R. Bullard and Mr. Rendel had four long interviews with Ibn Saud on the 20th, 21st and 22nd March, and many subjects of common interest were discussed. It may be mentioned that until this occasion Sir R. Bullard, although he had been in Jedda over six months, had only seen Ibn Saud once, and then only for a formal visit of a few minutes, and that he had had very little opportunity to discuss business even with the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey Hamza. The long talks with the King were therefore doubly welcome. The tone of the conversations was frank and friendly, and they led21 [17650] e* to an invitation to Sir R. Bullard to visit the King at Riyadh, an invitation which it was useful to have in hand when the time came to send the King advance copies of the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine. 78. The King began his conversations with Sir R. Bullard and Mr. Rendel by enunciating the principles which he said governed his life : religion, honour, and devotion to the interests of his subjects. He declared that he was a Moslem first of all, and that as a Moslem and an Arab he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of Arabs anywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After a reference to Palestine and to the Royal Commission then sitting, whose report he said he had advised the Mufti to await, he turned to the question of the Yemen, as an object of Italian intrigue. He had been consulted by Saiyid Husain, one of the sons of the King of the Yemen, who had been in Mecca for the pilgrimage, with regard to the attitude of Great Britain and Italy, and had told him about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire that the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. He was sure that internal dissension would lead to an outbreak in the Yemen, on the death of the King or even before : in that event what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government ? 79. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians had been, and still were, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome under standing of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as £ ‘ a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to establish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Government. No doubt Italian hotheads, possibly Italian local officials, cherished designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indications suggested that, for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think Ibn Baud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event, Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government. 80. Mr. Rendel added that he understood that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him, though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 81. At a later interview Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty’s Government from the moment when he first entered into com munication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish themselves strongly in the Arabian peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty’s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the Sharif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the £&lt; guarantees ” which he had received from Sir PercyU - • ^ 22 Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these “ guarantees,” though he had been promised “ all sorts of things.” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein— offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw his offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein replied that Ibn Baud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Baud thereupon informed His Majesty’s Government that he must lay down two conditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz, and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba, which the Shereefians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further; when he refrained, at the request of His Majesty’s Government, from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappointment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got ? Nothing whatever. On the contrary! 82. Ibn Baud said he would put his complaints under three heads :— (a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (b) Their boundary policy was always hemming him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein. Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty's Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 83. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, however, Ibn Baud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Baud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Biitain. As to the Italians, he swore that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived he had wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full our resources for the manu facture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should, therefore, be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance m matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty' would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 84- At a later meeting Mr. Rendel spoke of the necessity for co-ordination or skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia.23 having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.a., Egypt, to produce suitable candidates for aviation. Sir R. Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close relationship between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.g., in the Yemen? It was true that the Italians had themselves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and theii hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he did not care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots ti ained in Italy were no good. At one point in the conversation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iiaqis to help in aviation later on. 85. At the third interview the King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government, but he reached that subject by a circuitous route, beginning with some talk about the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Temen and the League of Nations. He then that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab'rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Koweit, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms weie in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs, and therefore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Saud seemed to accept this statement without demur. 86. This subject led to a discussion of the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, but the King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject, and he now reached the point with which he had begun, viz., his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. What would happen to him in the case of war ? Suppose war beo’an in Europe, or in the Yemen, or anywhere? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser understanding with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 87. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especially any kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system, which would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could haidly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a thieat to His Majesty s Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than any treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sii R. Bullaid reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty’s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a cc vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. 88. When speaking about Palestine, in the last interview, Ibn Baud said that there were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was, of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general, and of the [17650] E * 224 Ai ftbs in particular, was well known. I he Italians had used the pilnrirnasre for propaganda purposes, and had done the A best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. 89. The series of interviews ended with one last question from Ibn Saud. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do; what should he say? Should he reply to this effect:— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-intervention. Mr. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly. 90. When Sir R. Bullard visited Riyadh in July Ibn Saud expressed his confidence in His Majesty s Government and the British in remarkably strong terms- It must be remembered that he had only just received the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine, and that not only had he had no time to consider it adequately but he assumed that the partition scheme was cut and dried; he was, ^kcrefore, thinking exclusively of his own interests : hence the reserves about Aqaba and Maan which are referred to in the Palestine section of this report. He expressed great concern about the Italians. He referred slightingly of M. Mussolini as the “ Sword of Islam,” but spoke with apprehension about his disposition to interefere in the affairs of other countries—mow Abyssinia, now Spain oi the Red Sea. He had heard that the Italians had landed men on Hanish Island and its neighbour. He spoke of his reluctance to purchase arms from the Italians, as they would want something in return. To elicit further views on this point Sir R. Bullard asked whether the King thought that His Majesty’s Govern ment would want something in return for the arms which they were about to supply at low prices. No, said Ibn Saud; the interests of Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were identical. And would not the Italians allege that their interests were identical with his ? Ibn Saud indicated that he did not care what the Italians alleged. When all was said, he declared, the British were the best people. They weie better than the Italians, better than the Turks—better than the Arabs. He would even have preferred, from the purely Saudi point of view, that His Majesty s Government should retain the mandate over Iraq. With the British as his neighbours he felt safe. As an Arab and a Moslem he must sympathise with the advance towards Arab independence, but the independence of Iraq had created a situation which he viewed with grave anxiety. And now the British were going to give up their responsibility for Transjordan ! . l n the last interview which His Majesty’s Minister had with Ibn Saud m jt 7 18th ■ December )&gt; afte r speaking about several matters—the Italians and the Yemen, aviation, the Italian offer of arms, and Iraq—which are dealt with elsewhere, the King raised once more the question of Palestine. The minor cause of his anxiety, viz., the fear lest some other Arab State or individual should steal a march on him, is recorded in paragraph 92. . i 9^- question of Palestine was obviously still a major anxiety with the King, because, as he said, his own position, being dependent upon that oi His Majesty s Government, was weakened by the peril in which His Majesty’s Government stood by reason of the Zionist policy. If only some policy could'be found which would not place His Majesty’s Government in opposition to the b n L .P e y a ! estln ® problem seems quite simple to Ibn Saud, and Sir R. Bullard thought it well to ask whether His Majesty had not found, as he rose from being ruler of ftejd to his present high position, that at every stage the points of contact with the world increased and political questions became” more complicated and whether he could not believe that the affairs of Great Britain, coming as she did into touch with many countries which did not concern Saudi Arabia seriously and haying possessions all over the world, were even more complicated than His Majesty’s. The King pondered a moment as though the[17650] E * 3 matter had not struck him in that light before and said that he agreed, and it may be hoped that the argument helped to convince him of the truth of Sir R. Bullard’s assurance, that it was not from failure to give careful attention to his proposals that His Majesty’s Government had not been able to decide upon a policy more satisfactory from his point of view. 93. Saudi-Transjordan Frontier .—Advantage was taken of Mr. Rendel’s visit to urge the Saudi Arabian Government to accept the British proposal, which was one of the alternatives originally put forward by Fuad Bey, viz., that a joint delimitation commission should make a survey and then proceed to delimit the frontier on the basis of the position of the places as shown in the 1918 map. Nothing would induce Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, however, to agree beforehand upon the principle to be adopted when a correct map should have been made. He proposed that a joint commission should first make a survey and prepare a map, and that the two parties should then compare the new map with the old and try to delimit the frontier in friendly discussion. Sir R. Bullard and Mr. Rendel eventually came to the conclusion that this proposal should be recommended to the Foreign Office. The Saudi scheme involved the risk of duplication and unnecessary expense, but the advantages of acceding to the Saudi proposal seemed to outweigh by far any drawbacks that might attach to it. By giving way on a point to which the Saudi Government seem to attach great importance we could show that our proposal was not a trap and that they were being given fair treatment, while our own interests would be protected by the fact that whatever procedure might be adopted, in the end the frontier would have to be drawn according to the places shown on the map. His Majesty’s Government accepted this point of view and decided to take part in a joint survey “without prejudice,” and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was informed of this during his visit to London. By the end of November the Legation were able to inform the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that His Majesty’s Government hoped to be able to send out a survey party in the spring of 1938 and trusted that this would be convenient to the Saudi Arabian Government and that the latter would be able to appoint a party to participate in the survey on their behalf. To obviate any misunderstanding as to the cost it was added that His Majesty’s Government assumed that the best way to deal with that point was for each of the two Governments to pay for its own party. It was feared that the Saudi Arabian Government might have some difficulty in providing personnel for this purpose, but it was eventually learned that they proposed to borrow an American surveyor from the California Standard Oil Company, who will doubtless be willing to pay his salary and provide the apparatus in order to remain on good terms with the Government. 94. Eastern and South-Eastern Boundary .—His Majesty’s Minister was instructed at the beginning of January, as was related in paragraph No. 67 of the 1936 report, to inform Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government regarded both Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid as essential and to ask on what other parts of the frontier he thought that he and His Majesty’s Minister could produce joint proposals that would appeal to their Governments. The communica tion was made, and later Fuad Bey brought word that Ibn Saud could not give way on this matter, but was willing to leave the point in abeyance, being confident that nothing untoward would occur to mar Anglo-Saudi relations. After a preliminary talk about other parts of the frontier His Majesty’s Minister noted that it seemed likely that the Saudi Government would be prepared to compromise about the frontier of the Aden Protectorate and that Fuad Bey appeared to know nothing whatever about the Oman frontier. 95. With the consent of the Government of Aden a copy of their tribal map was shown to Fuad Bey, and it was pointed out to him that the point where the Saudi line would be nearest to the sea, viz., 52 East and 17 North, would be right among the Aden Protectorate tribes. Fuad Bey had always been an exponent of the tribal basis of territorial claims and was not prepared with a reply. He made the personal suggestion that the point which had been shown to him as among the Aden Protectorate tribes should be moved farther north, but so as still to leave Shishur and Tadhau in Saudi territory. Asked whether these two wells were on the list of Murra wells which he communicated to the Foreign Office in 1935 he said he thought they were; but in this he was mistaken. He said that he would find out on what the Saudi claim to these two wells and26 to Sanaa and Thamut (Thamud) was based, but he never gave the result of his enquiries to His Majesty’s Minister. After studying the evidence in Thomas s Arabia Felix Sir R. Bullard wrote to Fuad Bey on the 12th February to say that all this evidence seemed to show— (1) That all these four wells were in the steppe country which slopes from the coastal mountains to the sand; (2) That the tribes in that belt are all tribes to which Ibn baud makes no claim * (3) That the Murra do not come as far south as these four wells. 96. So far as the Saudi Government were concerned this was the last word on the southern frontier during the year, but the Government of Aden weie asked by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to consider whether some additional concession might not be made in the area between parallels 17 and 18, paiticulaily to the west of meridian 51. It was desirable, the Secretary of State stated, that the question should be examined from the point of view of the limits ot the area over which our tribes had indubitable claims rather than with a view to the exclusion of Ibn Saud from districts where the ownership was quite indeterminate. After careful study the Government of Aden said that the utmost concession that would be politically wise (and they hoped that less would be conceded) was to let Saudi Arabia have an additional strip of territory by drawing the boundary from the intersection of the violet line with mendian 48 to a point on meridan 52, 20 miles south of parallel 17. I his proposal was approved by the Colonial Office. His Majesty s Minister said that he did not think that a strip of desert land some 20 miles wide by 300 long would have great value as a bargaining counter. There was no sign that Ibn Saud attached great importance to that part of the frontier at present. Out of deference to the views of the Government of Aden, Sir R. Bullard said, we should try to avoid making the suggested sacrifice, but if a unilateral declaration was to be made about the frontier of Qatar (see below), he thought we should be prepared to leave to Ibn Saud the whole of the strip in question. On the 1st July the Foreign Office telegraphed to Jedda, after the frontier question had been con sidered by the Middle-East Official Sub-Committee, that as regards the southern section His Majesty’s Government thought that the balance of advantage lay in leaving the matter in abeyance for the present. In conveying this decision to the Government of Aden, the Colonial Office pointed out that the present policy of establishing our authority more firmly in the interior of the Protectorate would enable more knowledge to the obtained, and His Majesty’s Government might thus be in a stronger position a little later to state their claim in that area. 97. The Saudi Arkbian-Muscat frontier was not discussed in Jedda. It did, however, form the subject of correspondence between the Political Agent at Muscat and the Sultan. The Sultan showed reluctance to define his land frontier on the west. As he said, this had never been done before. It was suspected that the possibility that oil concessions were being talked about made him even more suspicious than he would have been in any case. The Sultan eventually went so far, however, in a letter addressed to the Political Agent on the Hth May, as to state that he would have no objection if the eastern limits of the territory belonging to Ibn Saud were recognised as being defined by a line joining the lines C, I), E, G, H, and I, as marked on a map which the Political Agent had given him. These points (omitting point “I,” which does not affect the Sultan) were defined by the Foreign Office as follows : — C = intersection of 52° E. and 23° N. D = intersection of 54° 40' E. and 22° 40' N. E = intersection of 55° 40' E. and 22° N. G = intersection of 55° E. and 20° N. H = intersection of 52° E. and 19° N. In August the Foreign Office wrote to the India Office suggesting that it might perhaps be as well if a communication were addressed to the Sultan mentioning, inter alia, that His Majesty’s Government had taken note of the fact that while he could not state precisely the limits of his claims, he, at any rate, laid no claim to any territory beyond the points D, E, G, and H (point C, like point I, not affecting him), as defined by co-ordinates above. This, the Foreign Office27 [17650] E * 4 said, would serve to narrow down any controversy which might possibly arise when, and if, the new oil concession recently granted to Petroleum Concessions, Limited, came to be exploited, and might help His Majesty’s Government to secure an eventual definition of the inland boundary of the Sultanate. Nothing more was heard about this during the year. 98. In September the Political Agent at Bahrein expressed apprehension about efforts by Ibn Saud to establish his authority at Baraimi. Apparently Ibn Saud has long possessed some shadowy claim to Baraimi, but it lies so far outside the extreme limit of the eastern frontier which he has claimed in the course of the negotiations of the last few years that it would be difficult for him to put forward a territorial claim to the oasis now. On the other hand, Baraimi seems to be in the most promising area from the point of view of oil, and if oil should actually be discovered in the oasis and boring begin, the temptation to Ibn Saud to found a claim of some kind on whatever rights he ever had there would be great. 99. To return to Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el-Odeid (paragraph 94 above), a thorny question which was still unsolved at the end of the year : On his way out to Jedda via Bushire, Mr. Rendel went into this point thoroughly with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and they visited the spot in a Royal Air Force aeroplane. Mr. Rendel made a careful sketch of the whole Jabal Dukhan, of which the Jabal Nakhsh was found to be clearly an integral part. On arrival in Jedda Mr. Rendel and Sir R. Bullard had a long discussion with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba on the subject. Mr. Rendel described the terrain and gave Sheikh Yusuf copies of his sketch-maps, but whereas he dwelt on the fact that Jabal Nakhsh was an integral part of Jabal Dukhan and Jabal Dukhan of the Qatar Peninsula, Sheikh Yusuf reinterated the old argument based on tribes : all the tribes in that area owed allegiance to Ibn Saud, who might have claimed much more, but if Jabal Nakhsh were conceded to him he would abandon the rest of his claim in that quarter. Mr. Rendel said that the integrity of the peninsula must be maintained. The claim to Jabal Nakhsh had been put forward by the Saudi Government at an advanced stage in the discussion and came as a complete surprise to His Majesty’s Government. Was it worth missing a settlement for it? Attention was then turned to Khor-el-Odeid, where, Mr. Rendel said, he had hoped that something might be done to meet the King’s wishes in this area, but a profound study of the records showed that for sixty years or more—long before there was any question of a Saudi claim—we had formally recognised it as part of the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. A note giving the most important points from the history of the case, including extracts from a letter from Sir Percy Cox to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, dated 1st December, 1906, recognising Odeid as in Abu Dhabi territory, was handed to Sheikh Yusuf. Sheikh Yusuf and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba argued that recognition of our special treaty relations with the Trucial Sheikhs in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda did not imply recognition of any particular frontiers, but Mr. Rendel pointed out that our recognition of a valid claim by such a sheikh to any particular place formed part of our treaty relations with that sheikh and must be regarded as covered by Ibn Saud’s recognition of our special relations with him. Finally, Mr. Rendel pointed that, while the Khor- el-Odeid itself was valueless to the King, being useless as a harbour, the land to the west of it afforded the only land passage between Abu Dhabi and Qatar. In any case it would be impossible for us to go back on the undertaking of 1906. Finally the discussion turned to the Sufuq (better, Safaq) wells. Here, said Mr. Rendel, there was* hope that some concession could be made. If, as he believed, the wells were much nearer the coast than appeared from the map, the Saudi frontier could be moved further towards the coast, on condition that Safaq and the caravan route remained in Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin played the usual Saudi card of declaring Safaq to be a Marra well, but this Mr. Rendel could not admit. 100. It may be mentioned here that a few days later information was received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, based on investigations made by the Royal Air Force, that Safaq was, in fact, much nearer to the coast than used to be supposed. It appears that even the latest General Staff map shows Safaq as nearly three times as far from the coast, measured along a line running almost directly north, as it really is.-''^WP! 11 ' 28 4 4 101. In a third interview with Ibn Sand, on the 21st March, Mr. Rendel made a strong appeal for a settlement. His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions : could not His Majesty make some concession here ? Ibn Sand repeated the familiar argument that the whole of the coast had belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. There was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. Unfortunately the maps which were at hand did not show Araik. Sir R. Bullard said he believed it to be south of Jabal Nakhsh, in which case there would be no longer any disagreement on that point. As to Khor-el-Odeid, Ibn Baud said, in claiming it for Saudi Arabia, he was thinking as much of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as of his own, for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that people applied for redress. 102. Immediately after this interview Sir R. Bullard wrote to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin saying that a map in the possession of the Legation showed Araik (Uraiq) as between Qasr-as-Salwa and Jabal Nakhsh, and asking whether His Majesty’s definition did not leave Jabal Nakhsh to Qatar. His Majesty’s reply, as trans mitted by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, was to the effect that he did not mean the Uraiq of Nakhsh but the one south of Dukhan, which made Nakhsh within Saudi Arabia, and anyhow his statement was £ ‘ accidental and did not concern the details of the case.” At the same time Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sent the King’s protest against what he calls the “ hemming-in ” policy of His Majesty’s Govern ment which is referred to elsewhere (paragraph 71). 103. When reporting on this question Sir R. Bullard suggested that it was undesirable to try to force a settlement at the moment. Had it been possible to settle the matter during Mr. Rendel’s visit it would have been a good thing, but the frontier was evidently a sore point with Ibn Saud, and given that feeling, and the difference of opinion about the physical features in the Jabal Nakhsh area, to press our point of view upon Ibn Saud would be useless and would go far to counteract the good effect of the Rendel conversations. In view of what His Majesty’s Government had said on this subject Ibn Saud might well feel that he could not hope to obtain either of the two coveted areas, but that was not the same thing as signing them away. As to the danger likely to result from an undetermined frontier : in case of war, if Ibn Saud were on the other side a paper frontier would not hold him back, while if he were an ally or neutral he would not disturb the status quo. Sir R. Bullard proposed, however, that lest our claim should go by default we should suggest that a joint commission should visit the Jabal Nakhsh area to examine the physical features. He also urged that we should examine carefully the possibility of giving Ibn Saud a royalty on any oil that might be struck in or near Jabal Nakhsh on the pretext that the oil-bearing strata must run partly under his territory. (This suggestion, which was of course modelled on the scheme by which Iraq helped to buy off Turkish intransigence about Mosul, was found to be impracticable). Sir R. Bullard pointed out how great a strain would be placed upon Ibn Saud if the search for oil and minerals in his country continued to be unsuccessful and oil should be found, as it had been in Bahrein, in the territory of some minor ruler like the Sheikh of Qatar. 104. In May the Foreign Office replied that, while the undesirability of pressing Ibn Saud for a decision was appreciated, to leave the question in the air indefinitely would be dangerous; for one thing Petroleum Concessions (Limited) might begin prospecting soon in the south-western area of Qatar Peninsula. If nothing were done to crystallise the frontier situation on lines which appeared to us reasonable and such as to fulfil our obligations to our Arab client States Ibn Saud might perhaps be tempted to extend his influence still further and thus render the eventual settlement more difficult, especially if Anglo-Saudi relations were to deteriorate as a result of the Palestine Report. In these circumstances, the Foreign Office asked, would His Majesty’s Minister advocate a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government, which could if necessary be treated as confidential, laying down the line which they regarded as the boundary? This could be done in a friendly note explaining that, while appreciating His Majesty’s reasons for not wanting to commit himself on this subject at present, we could not leave the matter in the air. After defining the northern sector as in the Riyadh proposals, modified in accordance with thediscovery of the exact position of Safaq, the note would explain that His Majesty’s Government did not claim for themselves or for their proteges anything beyond that line but proposed to treat the territory on the Qatar and Abu Uhadi side of the line as being under their suzerainty and control or that of the Arab rulers concerned. It would add that His Majesty’s Government desired to record their position to avoid misunderstanding, but that to save Ibn Baud any possible embarrassment they would not press for publication. 105. Sir R. Bullard replied that the possibility that prospecting for oil might begin soon justified the communication, but proposed that to soften the blow we should first give the most favourable reply possible to Ibn Sand’s request for arms (reminding him of the arms supplied at a critical moment in 1929, and saying that we did not propose to press for payment or, better, that the balance had been wiped out), and then send as sympathetic a reply as possible to the protest about being hemmed in and should offer to show any Saudi representatives that might be appointed that Jabal Nakhsh was part of Jabal Dukhan, this question was considered at a Middle Dast Sub-Committee on the 29th June and the Foreign Office informed His Majesty’s Minister that the suggestion for a unilateral declaration by His Majesty’s Government need not be pursued, at any rate until it was known that the oil companies had decided to start pros pecting and exploitation in the disputed areas. The Foreign Office said that they were inclined to adopt Sir R. Bullard’s proposal for a communication to Ibn Saud suggesting a survey of the disputed area—a rough topographical enquiry and report which need not take many months, though they said it would probably be necessary to insist on the inclusion of a representative of the Sheikh of Qatar in the party. They authorised Sir R. Bullard to speak to Ibn Saud in this sense or to leave it till later when it might be possible to put forward more detailed proposals. In virtue of this discretion Sir R. Bullard, who was just about to leave for Riyadh when the telegram came, decided to leave the point until later, partly because all that he and, as it turned out, the Political Resident also had had in mind was “ a brief visit to the area in question by which Saudi represen tatives could by evidence of their own eyes see that our contentions were correct and especially that Jabal Nakhsh was part of Jabal Dukhan.” 106. The question remained in abeyance for some months, but news was received that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, who hold the concession on the Saudi side of the frontier, were showing activity in the neigh bourhood of Qasr-as-Salwa, and this made it necessary to take a decision. A meeting of the Middle East Official Sub-Committee was therefore held on the 8th November, Sir R. Bullard being present, and on the strength of the decision adopted instructions were issued to Jedda which formed the basis of a note addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by His Majesty’s Legation on the 4th December. The important passage of this note read “ I have the honour to inform your Royal Highness that according to recent reports which have reached His Majesty’s Government it appears that the Standard Oil Company of California (California Arabian Oil Company) are prospecting in the neighbourhood of Qasr-al-Salwa. the views of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the frontier in the said area have already been communicated to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz, and His Majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen negotiations for a settlement on the lines they have indicated. They assume that in the meantime no attempt will be made by the California Arabia Company to pass the line defined in the latest proposals of His Majesty’s Government to His Majesty Kino- Abdul Aziz so long as no final agreement has been reached as to that line. Since, however, there is some uncertainty as to the precise position of certain of the physical features concerned, His Majesty s Government propose that a joint Anglo-Saudi topographical mission should be appointed to establish on the spot the exact nature and position of those features.” To obviate misunderstanding the definition of the frontiei as given by Sii Andiew Ryan at Riyadh was repeated, with the necessary modification in regard to Safaq. 107 As soon as the note had been sent in, the Foreign Office weie infoimed in order that they might be able to act on their intention to acquaint the London30 representative of the California Standard Arabian Oil Company informally with the position. Sir R. Bullard received authority to make a similar communication to the Jedda representative of the company. 108. Both Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin brought to Sir R. Bullard strongly coloured reports of the King’s annoyance at the note. It was typical of our behaviour—assurances of friendship, but never any concession on any material issue. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin even reported the King as asking whether the British wished to treat him as the Italians were treating Spain and the Japanese China. This was expected, and, the mind of His Majesty’s Govern ment being at last made up, there was nothing to do about it except to produce arguments to show that they had, on the contrary, been helpful in many things and to go over the old wrangle about Jabal Nakhsh. After some havering Fuad Bey said that the Saudi Government had informed the California Standard Oil Company of the divergence of views about the frontier, and he added that there was no cause to fear that the company would take action in disputed territory. He, however, accused His Majesty’s Government of letting people prospect there from the other side, probably on the strength of a sign put up at Safaq Wells to mark their exact position. In reporting this assurance to the Foreign Office, Sir R. Bullard said that he hoped it would continue to be possible to postpone prospecting in the disputed area for the present. He also reported that the Saudi Government favoured an agreement according to known places and principles rather than an examination of the physical features. Sir. R. Bullard explained to Fuad Bey that it was precisely the Saudi misapprehension as to the physical features in the Jabal Nakhsh area which had created the deadlock. This discussion, however, had no effect, and on the 30th December His Majesty’s Minister had to report to the Foreign Office, on the strength of the Saudi written reply, supplemented by conversations with Fuad Bey, that the attitude of the Saudi Arabian Government was as follows :— (1) Until final settlement as to disputed area is concluded oil people from Saudi side will not enter it provided there is similar abstention by company operating in Arab States on the Persian Gulf. (2) They have always been ready to conclude agreement. Obstacle has been unwillingness of His Majesty’s Government to recognise “actual situation of what is in reality in the possession and under the influence of” Ibn Saud. Consequently. (3) As to proposed mission, they ask whether His Majesty’s Government do not share their opinion that it is advisable to agree upon a frontier in principle, first by specifying either places or co-ordinates. The wording regarding mutual abstention is pretty strong, since it almost amounts to a declaration that if there is prospecting from the British side the Saudi Government will allow prospecting from their side, but even this wording was only secured after much argument with Fuad Bey. The Saudi note said :— “ They do not believe that the company’s employees will go beyond what my Government believe to be within their territories, just as they believe that the responsible authorities in the Arab amirates on the Persian Gulf, for their part, will not allow the representatives or employees of the companies operating in their territories to cross the line laid down in the note to Sir Andrew Ryan, until a final agreement has been concluded between the parties concerned.” This wording, which would allow prospecting in the disputed territory from the Saudi side but not from the other, was neither logical nor in accordance with the assurance given by Fuad Bey, and Sir R. Bullard, therefore, supposed that there had been a mistake in drafting, but he elicited from various mysterious and roundabout statements made by Fuad Bey, that the wording was intentional. It was, however, exchanged in a letter from Fuad Bey for the mutual absention proposals already mentioned. 109. In reporting this reply to the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Minister said that Ibn Saud clung as tenaciously as ever to Jabal Nakhsh and Khor-el- Obeid and Safaq, from 1 motives of prestige exacerbated by poverty and the smell of oil. Several papers from Bushire on the Legation files bore out, he said, Ibn Saud’s statement that it was he and not our friends who administered at31 least the first two of the points in dispute. He was aware that the history of the case went much further back than that, and that settlement by tribal influence exclusively had been ruled out. What he wanted to avoid was forcing the issue while the international situation was so disturbed, and he suggested that it would be worth while to refrain from prospecting m the disputed area and to wait for better times. The Foreign Office were unable to accept this point of view. The rest of the story, however, belongs to 110 Supply of Arms.—In March Sheikh Yusuf Yasm informed His Maiestv’s Minister that the Saudi Government wanted to enlist the help of the United 7 Kingdom Government in their rearmament scheme, comprising the establishment of a cartridge factory at Riyadh and the purchase of guns, she . and machine guns The Minister supported this proposal on the ground that anv efforts this direction would not be wasted, as would those directed towards the encouragement of the Saudi Government to embark on an elaboi ate aviatio scheme. 111 When Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was in London at the time of the Corona tion he' discussed with the Foreign Office the proposed cartridge factory at Riyadh. It was found, however, that the Saudi Government had merely got estimates for equipment picked out of a catalogue from a firm that was no itself'the maker of the equipment. It was found po^ to obtain “suranc rvP thp Wir Office that equipment supplied by the makers m question ^ aonarenHy working well hi Bagdad, but Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was unable to niirsue the discussion through technical ignorance and also through ignorance of the exact requirements of his Government, and there the matter remained. 112 Efforts by His Majesty’s Minister to obtain an estimate of the Saudi Government’s requirements in the matter of arms were unavailing. These reouirements said Sheikh Yusuf, might be described as unlimited. It appeared that the financial aspect of the matter was particularly '“P^^^y^-^Iso thpv wanted most was rifles, guns and machine guns. Sheikh lusul Yasm also added tanks but when asked whether he meant tanks or armoured cars he said “ both or either ” It was at this time that Ibn Saud sent word that the Italians JveoLTng to sell him Italian or German rifles or machine guns (see para graph 134). 113 After a struggle with many difficulties, one of which was the fact that the Saudi Government had paid only a small part of the cost of arms supplied in 1929, it was found that HuTMajesty’s Government had a small nnantitv of arms’and ammunition that could be supplied at a price within the means of the Saudi Government, viz., 100 Lewis guns, 100 Hotchkiss guns, four 18-pounder field guns complete, 1,000 rounds of shrapnel for the guns, and 10 million rounds of small-arm ammunition. Ihey could not oflei ufles at comuetitive prices or even, in view of the British rearmament programme at anv orice and purchase from a British firm, supposing the order could &gt; be under taken at the present time, would be even more expensive. His Majesty s Go\ein- m® suggested that it might be well to seek supplies in some “ neutral country such as Belgium or Czechoslovakia rather than from an interested party like Italy The supply of armoured cars was, they said, surrounded by the same difficulties as that of rifles. 114 Ibn Saud accepted gratefully the offer of the arms specified above, and ibpv wprc hi Tided in Jedda from a British steamer on the 17th October, 1937 He Wd have liked another battery of guns and 4 000 instead of 1 000 rounds of shrapnel but in this it was not possible to oblige him An ab^ui d attempt to a the arms secretly to the north of the town of Jedda only drew more attention to the event which created a considerable stir, and is believed to have intensified the Italian efforts to induce the King to accept arms from them on easy teims. 115 There was a suggestion that Ibn Saud might like to purchase some cartridges which were theS at Berbera. They had been ordered by the former Ethiopfan Government, but had not reached them before then collapse. The scheme was not followed up, however, chiefly owing to doubt about the owneiship of the ammunition.32 116. The reports, which were probably unfounded, that arms intended perhaps for the Saudi Government had been landed somewhere on the shores of the Gulf of Akaba are dealt with in the section on Palestine. 117. Air Facilities on the Hasa Coast .—In accordance with the suggestion recorded in paragraph 69 of the report for 1936, the question of facilities for British aircraft on the Hasa coast of Saudi Arabia was not followed up. No British aircraft made a forced landing in Saudi territory during the year, so there was nothing to remind the Saudi Government of the matter. 118. Hejaz Railway .—In January Fuad Bey enquired whether there was any reply from London to the note about the Haifa Conference which the Saudi Government had addressed to the British and French Legations in Jedda on the 20th January, 1936 (paragraph 70 of 1936). He hoped that after the change-over in the administration of Syria something might be done. When reminded that, according to the French, there had never been a surplus on the Syrian portion of the line, he talked about the days of King Husain, when, he alleged, £10,000 was spent in repairing the line and £40,000 was collected in fares and freight. Sir R. Bullard, while deprecating the building of financial hopes on any budget of King Husain’s, promised to wHte to the Foreign Office, though he reminded Fuad Bey that the High Commissioner for Transjordan had been busy with other matters. 119. A few days later a despatch was received from the Foreign Office trans mitting a semi-official letter from the Colonial Office and the views of the High Commissioner for Palestine on the Haifa Conference. The High Commissioner endorsed conclusions 1, 2, 4 and 5. He was unable, he said, to endorse the recom mendation of the Saudi representative that the repair of the damaged sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole. Apart from the political aspect of the question of ownership, there was the practical difficulty that neither the Palestme-Transjordan section nor the Syrian section had any surplus funds, while heavy expenditure for renewals would soon have to be incurred. It had been estimated by the general manager of the Palestine Railways that, if 7,000 pilgi ims, each paying £P. 12 for a return ticket, were carried annually by the railway, the costs of the restored line might just be covered and provision made for some maintenance, but there would be no margin for renewals, and the HioR Commissioner considered, on the basis of the numbers of pilgrims actually travel- ling fiom Syiia, Iiaq, 1 alestine and Iransjordan, with a few Indians in transit, that the figure of 7,000 pilgrims put forward by the Saudi delegate was much exaggei ated. He pointed out that, if the restoration of the railway offered any commercial advantages, it was to Northern Hejaz and Medina, and that conse quently the financial liability should rest on the Saudi Government. The HioR Commissioner said that he would be very glad if an agreed means could be found to provide the capital required, since, apart from any incidental benefits to I lansjoidan, the political relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud would, he suggested, be favourably affected. !20 The semi-official letter from the Colonial Office said that it was unlikely that eithei Palestine, Syria or I ransjordan could contribute towards a scheme of lestoration, sa\e that Transjordan might perhaps undertake some responsibility in respect of the small section in its own territory, if the whole scheme were adopted. It seemed equally unlikely that the Saudi Government could find the money, while the commercial possibilities were not such as to attract any private syndicate. It therefore seemed that the only way in which the money‘could be raised was for His Majesty s Government to provide it, not on commercial but possibly on political grounds. The railway was destroyed during the Great War and it might be argued that, regard being had to the history of its destruction and to its general interest to the Moslem world, and as a gesture to the Moslem world, His Majesty s Government should undertake to repair it It was also worth considering whether the railway might have a strategic value to His Majesty s Government as able to serve as a link in an alternative route to the Suez Canal in a war with Italy in which Ibn Saud threw in his lot with us The letter concluded by remarking that the railway had remained derelict for fifteen vears without causing any great disturbance in the Moslem world, and might presum ably continue to remain derelict without any untoward results. As time went on the need for a railway would diminish, as pilgrims would tend to o- 0 to Mecca more and more by motor routes.33 121. In transmitting these papers to His Majesty’s Minister, the Foreign Office asked for his views on the question, with particular reference to the sugges tion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps he justified, on political grounds, in bearing the expenditure themselves. Sir R. Bullard replied that, formerly, he had been inclined to think it would be a good thing if the line could be rebuilt, and that His Majesty’s Government might even be justified in con tributing something towards the cost, but that having examined the problem more closely he had come to the contrary conclusion. The reasons he gave were these :— (1) The line was not really necessary. Pilgrims could travel from Syrian or Palestinian ports or from Suez, and there was a motor route from Nejef to Medina and even (though a bad one) from Ma’an to Medina. The number of Turkish pilgrims had fallen. The passenger traffic would be seasonal with two sharp peaks. Grain might be carried from Transjordan, but then it was carried now, and if it went by rail it would deprive many who lived by animal transport of their livelihood. (2) It was true that His Majesty’s Government destroyed the line, but they did it with the enthusiastic co-operation of the Arabs in combined operations for a common end. And what of our allies ? Moreover, it must be remembered that the Hejaz Railway was built in despite of King Husain, who did, in fact, prevent the extension to Mecca. (3) It was doubtful whether we should acquire any credit in the Moslem world if we restored the line. Had we acquired any discredit for the part we took in its destruction ? Our credit rested upon more essential matters, e.q., our Palestine policy. We might even be accused of imperialism and of interference in the Holy Land of Islam, and to meet or to forestall such accusations Ibn Saud might be driven to minimise the part we played in the matter. (4) Ibn Saud’s attitude would be influenced by more important considera tions. Moreover, unless the railway was self-supporting Ibn Saud might expect us to meet the deficit, and be more dissatisfied with a refusal than with the present situation. On general grounds no scheme which might throw a financial burden upon the poor country of Saudi Arabia was to be recommended. (5) The strategic argument would only apply if Ibn Saud was our ally, and on the analogy of pre-War Turkey it was to be supposed that the enemies of Great Britain would make handsome territorial offers to Ibn Saud at our expense, and that we should have cause to be satisfied if Saudi Arabia remained neutral. Perhaps—though that was a question for experts in strategy—the railway might even be used as a weapon against us if Saudi Arabia should join the enemies of His Majesty’s Government. 122. The Secretary of State concurred in these views, and decided, in view of the arguments on which they were based, that it would be well to delay as long as possible the reply to the Saudi note. He, however, inquired from His Majesty Ambassador in Paris whether the French Government intended to reply to that note, and, if so, what the nature of their reply was likely to be. The French Government favoured an agreement as to the action to be taken, but they reiterated that even the acceptance of the Saudi thesis of the indivisibility of the line would be without practical effect so far as Syria was concerned, since the Syrian portion of the line had shown only a deficit for some years. A loan could hardly be raised on the security of the railway system, while if the Govern ments concerned guaranteed such a loan, the security might seem precarious. Given the change in the political status of Syria, France could hardly engage Syrian credit, while Syria might hesitate to pledge her own until she became fully responsible for her acts. His Majesty’s Government replied that they would be glad to concert with the French Government the reply to be returned eventually to the Saudi Arabian Government, but instructed His Majesty’s Ambassador to explain privately that in view of the possibility of the modification of the mandate in respect of Palestine and Transjordan, His Majesty’s Government would also find it difficult to determine the lines of reply at present, and would prefer to leave the discussion of the reply until the position became somewhat clearer. The French Government agreed to this course.34 123 On the 28th October the Saudi Minister in London wrote to the Foreign Office saying that when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin was in Syria he was informed by the Syrian Government that they were prepared, if the Saudi Government agreed, to issue a declaration that both Governments had agreed to negotiate with the Governments of France and Great Britain for the repair of the Hejaz Kai way, and asking for the information of the King what the opinion of His Majesty s Government was. This letter, which led to a vast correspondence, was even iia ) reduced to the small dimensions from which the enthusiasm ot Sheikh Yusul Yasin had blown it up into importance. Apparently all that had happened was that the President of the Syrian Council had made some anodyne remarks about the railway, and that these had been magnified by Sheikh Yusuf Yasm ihe Syrian Government had no objection to the reopening of the line, but w® 1 ® ^ f 1 ! mined not to spend money on any section outside Syria. Ibn Saud decide against the issue of any declaration, but asked His Majesty s Government or an early reply to the Saudi note of the 20th January. 124. Pilgrimage .—The only occasion when it seemed possible that serious friction might occur between the Legation and the Saudi authorities aiose m connexion with the Indian pilgrims. Complaints and requests for assistance by the Indian vice-consul seemed to be ignored, and there was serious trouble about the depositing of return tickets at the Legation. It was known that the Saudi authorities were becoming less inclined to permit the foreign Legations to intervene on behalf of their pilgrims, and there was a suspicion that the friction was partly due to the hostility of pilgrim guides whose abuses had been jf e td in check for years by the Indian vice-consul, Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah. On the other hand, it seemed certain that Khan Bahadur Ihsanullah had become persona non grata to the authorities, and that the work would never go well so long as he remained in charge, and he therefore retired on a pension. His successor, Saiyid Lai Shah, was very well received by the King and the Minister of Finance, both of whom promised him all the help he might need, and up to the end of the year he had not been hampered in his duties by the Saudi authorities in any way. It was known, however, that Saudi pilgrimage regulations were being prepared which, however admirable in some ways, might interfere with the procedure followed by the Legation in regard to Indian and Malayan pilgrims. That question, however, belongs to 1938. A minor cause of friction was removed by the resignation of the Indian doctor who had been attached to the Legation for about seven years. He had formerly been in the employ of the Saudi Government, and the fact that he had then become independent of the Saudi medical depart ment, and was in a position to pass criticism on that department to the Government of India, was resented. 125. Pecuniary Claims.— Majesty’s Minister, to whom discretion had been left to pursue, in such manner as might seem opportune, the matter of the claim of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in respect of arms supplied in 1929, suggested in April that the question should be allowed to strnd over for the time being. He considered that to have to resume payments on this debt would be an embarrassment to Ibn Saud from the financial point of view, and that a request that he should do so would be ill timed, in view of the Palestine situation, Italian offers of help and our inability to satisfy him in the matter of aviation and (as it seemed at the time) arms. He realised how difficult it would be either to wipe out or to leave outstanding a debt which not only appeared in the official financial statement every year, but had been the subject of comment in the press, but it seemed to him that to press for payment would arouse a feeling of resentment out of all proportion to the sum involved. The Foreign Office wrote to the India Office in October suggesting that there seemed to be little object in keeping the debt alive, and asking whether the Government of India shared this view and would be disposed to write off* their share if His Majesty’s Government wrote off theirs. No decision on this point had been taken by the end of the year. The amounts outstanding are : Due to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, £18,858 13s. 11&lt;Y; due to the Government of India, £9,429 7s. 126. Red Sea Oil Concession .—The Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Company (Limited), as the company operating this concession was eventually named, sent out two prospecting parties, one north and one south, and35 when a preliminary survey had been made they decided to drill for oil in the Farsan Islands. Drilling had begun when the year came to an end, but had not got very far. Other British Governments. 127. Nothing to report. France and Syria. 128. Syria was of interest to Saudi Arabia mainly because of the Alexandretta question (paragraph 155) and as the centre of the agitation about Palestine, though in fact no Saudi delegate attended the Bludan Conference which was held to discuss that subject (paragraph 25). Sheikh Yusuf Yasin paid a visit to Syria during which he made a pan-Arab speech of the kind which might be expected from him. He also caused much unnecessary correspondence (paragraph 123) by reading assurances into conventional remarks about the Hejaz Railway made by the President of the Council in Syria. 129. At the end of the year it was expected that M. de Martel, the French High Commissioner in Syria, would pay a visit to Saudi Arabia in the month of January 1938, if his work permitted. Fuad Bey informed His Majesty’s Minister that the visit was purely private, and that it was the result of a suggestion made to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin by M. de Martel when the former was visiting Syria. M. de Martel’s visit was eventually postponed. 130. The marriage between the Amir Saud and the granddaughter of Nuri Shalan (paragraph 82 of 1936) did not last very long. She was divorced during the summer of 1937. Italy. 131. If the 1936 report was correct in stating that the acute anxiety of the Saudi Government in regard to Italy had perhaps calmed down towards the end of that year, the calm did not last long. The attitude of Ibn Saud is described fully in the section on his relations with His Majesty’s Government. There seems to be no room for doubt that he dislikes and distrusts Italy and her policy, and looks to His Majesty’s Government in the hope of finding there some support against Italian designs in Arabia. His feelings are not softened by the urgent Italian offers to give him something for (ostensibly) nothing, or at any rate for very little, but, on the other hand, they are complicated by the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government. 132. It was expected that the departure of M. Persico, the Italian Minister, would perhaps be followed by the appearance of a Fascist thruster who would inaugurate a more vigorous policy, but the new Minister, M. Sillitti, who had spent most of his previous service in consular posts in the United States, where he seems to have developed into a “ regular guy,” does not appear to be a great force, while the replacement of an Italian Levantine vice-consul by a first secretary from Vienna has improved the correctness of the Legation's behaviour. On the other hand, it was understood at the end of the year that the Libyan Arab who had been the Legation’s interpreter was to be appointed to reside permanently in Mecca. 133. The endeavours made by the Italians to ingratiate themselves with Ibn Saud through services to Saudi aviation received little encouragement. The remaining two of the three Caproni aeroplanes which the Italian Government had decided to present to the Saudi Government (paragraph 89 of 1936) arrived on the 27th April, 1937, but their cool reception in Jedda, where they were met by no one but the commandant and a customs officer, was a marked snub which the Italian pilot then in charge, Colonel Ciancio, resented keenly, the more so in that when, shortly afterwards, the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate made the Saudi Government a present of a far from new Bellanca monoplane, the presentation was made the occasion of an imposing ceremony. The Italian pilot in charge, first Colonel Ciancio and later a Major Ciccii, who had been in Jedda before as a captain, was given almost no work to do, and personal facilities, e.g., in the matter of transport, were withheld or granted very grudgingly. British officers and their Government would neither have submitted to such treatment, nor been content to acquiesce in the maintenance of a mission which was doing nothing, but it seems clear that the Italian Government are prepared to keep the air mission here, under any conditions, until it is asked to withdraw. Possibly they are36 content to block the way for any other mission. Their policy, whatever its purpose, costs them more than it costs the Saudi Government, who provide nothing but food and quarters. The mission consists of an officer pilot and about eight mechanics, who are all on the strength of the Italian Air Force and are paid from Italian funds. The mechanics are relieved at intervals of six months or so. 134. At the time when Sheikh Yusuf asked for the help of His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom in obtaining arms he brought a message from Ibn Saud, coupled with the hope that His Majesty’s Government would not think that the King was trying to play one country oft' against another, that the Italians had offered to supply him with Italian or German rifles or machine guns, and that he proposed to keep them in play. The first offer seems to have been narrowed down to one of 4,000 rifles (at first said by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to be German, but apparently Italian) at 250 lire apiece. The Saudi Government declared that this price was too high, as they had bought some from Belgium a few years before at one and a half gold pounds apiece, c.i.f. Jedda. 135. Ibn Saud informed Sir R. Bullard at Riyadh in July that the Italians had eventually reduced their price to 10s. gold apiece. He did not want to accept anything from the Italians, but, on the other hand, he did not want to offend them, so he had refused on the ground that he had no Italian rifles in his army and that to introduce a new type would be confusing. He continued the story at an interview granted to His Majesty’s Minister in December. The Italians had offered to get him any kind of rifles he liked, £.^., Mausers from Austria or Germany. When the King pleaded poverty, the Italians assured him that easy terms could be arranged. Keeping to his delaying tactics the King said that if samples could be furnished the matter would be studied. And there the matter rested for the moment. Ibn Saud asked whether he had done right: what would His Majesty’s Government say ? 136. His Majesty’s Minister could only repeat what the Saudi Minister in London had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government had provided all the arms which their urgent needs enabled them to spare. If it had been within their power they would gladly have supplied more, but it was not. Ibn Saud was the sole judge of his requirements in the matter of arms. It would evidently be better if he could obtain them from “ neutral ” sources rather than from a Government like the Italian, which, as His Majesty had himself said, was not offering cheap arms out of pure love for Saudi Arabia, but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. 137. According to a statement made to His Majesty’s Minister by Fuad Bey at this time, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti-aircraft guns, in fact any war material that Ibn Saud might need. 138. Italian propaganda in various forms was much in evidence. The pilgrimage, in particular, was used for this purpose, but the Italian Legation also distributed newspapers from Libya. The Bari broadcasts in Arabic reached an increasing circle of listeners in the Hejaz as the use of wireless apparatus became more common. 139. The Italians did not at first abandon their proposal to establish a hospital in the Hejaz. As a compromise they offered to build a hospital in Mecca and hand it over to the Saudi Government to administer, but the offer was refused. They, however, took a newly-built house in a prominent position near the Italian Legation and established in it a well-equipped dispensary in the charge of an Italian doctor with experience of the East. The equipment includes X-ray apparatus, in the use of which Dr. Ghersi is said to be skilled. One floor of the house’was intended for beds, but at the end of the year it was vacant— perhaps because the Saudi authorities objected to the plan as cover for the establishment of a hospitals 140. Pilgrims from Ethiopia (paragraph 93 of 1936) were, in fact, sub sidised by the Italian authorities. How many came on these terms it is difficult to ascertain, as the information on the subject, as published in the Mecca press, was apparently so treated as to minimise or conceal the Italian effort as far as37 possible. These newspaper reports bear out the assertion of Tbn Sand that he had resisted the attempt of the Italians to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. 141. An inspired report in the Corriere delVImpero of Addis Ababa gives the number of Ethiopian pilgrims as about 1,696, and claims that the Italian Legation in Jedda hired five houses in Jedda for them at the expense of the Italian Government and kept a number of cars at their disposal. It is true that some houses were taken for this purpose. His Majesty’s consulate at Harrar was able to send the names of some twenty-five of the Harrar Moslems who made the pilgrimage at State expense, together with an indication of those likely to have received funds for propaganda. Some of the Ethiopian pilgrims were, in fact, heard advertising Italian benevolence towards Islam, and one made a pro-Italian speech at a meeting held at Mima after the pilgrimage. 142. The Italian organisation of the pilgrims’ journey by sea was not perfect. To collect the last batch from Italian Red Sea ports the Italian Legation were obliged at the last moment to hire a British pilgrim-ship lying in Jedda harbour, while after the pilgrimage some of the pilgrims were delayed a con siderable time waiting for ships and were given money by the Italian Legation to maintain them until they could get away. 143. The Italians showed the closest interest in the pilgrims from Spanish Morocco, whose pilgrimage was subsidised by the Insurgent Government (para graph 169). The pilgrims were treated by the Italian Legation in Jedda as though they were Libyans. 144. His Majesty’s Legation received instructions from the Foreign Office to keep watch on the Arabic newspapers distributed by the Italian Legation and to report to them any striking piece of Italian propaganda, whether anti- British or pro-Italian, but more particularly the former. It was not until April that an example of such propaganda was met with. On the 17th April messengers of the Italian Legation distributed in the streets of Jedda Arabic newspapers from Libya containing mainly propaganda about Signor Mussolini’s visit, including the proclamation by Air Marshal Balbo ending: “The Duce is the Protector of Islam. That is why he honours the Moslems.” One of the papers contains an article violently anti-British and rather less violently anti-French. It classed the Arabs with the Romans, and the Fascists as humane and enlightened colonists, as opposed, e.g., to the British, who had reduced the aboriginal population of Australia from 20 million to 25,000 by oppression, exile, massacre and neglect; and described the British in India as sucking her blood while the people, once famous for their wealth, were dying of hunger. 145. This article formed the subject of a strong protest to Count Ciano through His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome. Count Ciano said that he knew nothing of the newspaper or its distribution, but would at once enquire ^^o it. His Majesty’s Ambassador concluded that the Italian Minister at Jedda would receive a merited reprimand. Since then the distribution of such propaganda has been more discreet, and the only article to which the attention of the Foreign Office has been drawn was not seriously anti-British. 1 erhaps it would be more correct to say that the distribution of such propaganda has been less open rather than more discreet, since for some time the Italian Legation had Libyan newspapers given to the Saudi postmen for distribution—an impertinence which was discovered by the authorities and caused great annoyance to Ibn Saud. But at least some care is now taken to dissociate the Legation from the distribution. 146. The most outrageous piece of propaganda was the publication in the Corriere delVImpero of Addis Ababa of a statement alleged to have been made to Marshal Graziani at Asmara by the Saudi Arabian Director-General of Customs. This person, according to the Corriere, represented Ibn Saud as having always been sympathetic to the policy of Marshal Graziani in Cyrenaica and declared that the Saudi Government and people cherished a lively sympathy for Italy for what she had done for Moslem peoples in the Empire, and con sidered Mussolini as the sincerest friend of Islam. It was learned in Jedda38 that the Director of Customs (there is no Director-General) had not been to Eritrea, and that if any statement had been made it was by a man born in Massawa who was for a time employed as a clerk in the Jedda customs but went to Eritrea on holiday in 1936—leaving a deficit of about £30 in the funds for which he was responsible. lie served M. Odello (paragraph 79 of 1935) as an interpreter during the Ethiopian crisis. 147. This Italian propaganda eventually overreached itself. The indigna tion of Ibn Sand was thoroughly aroused, and at the end of the year he was preparing measures calculated to limit, if they could not entirely prevent, the spread of such propaganda in this country. 148. In February a despatch was received from the Foreign Office instructing His Majesty’s Minister to report on the question of Italian pro paganda in Arabia, which, it said, was causing the Secretary of State increasing concern. The despatch continued “ This propaganda naturally takes various forms, and to some of these it would be impossible for His Majesty’s Government or the Saudi Govern ment to take exception. Much of it may, in fact, be described as primarily pro-Italian, and, if it is anti-British at all, it is so only by implication. On the other hand a considerable amount of Italian propaganda is aimed directly at weakening the position and prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Arab countries, or at least at emphasising those aspects of Italian policy which may, from the superficial point of view and to the untutored Arab mind, be contrasted most effectively with the less spectacular achievements of the policy of this country. “ The question of bringing about a termination of definitely anti-British propaganda activities in the Middle East takes an important place among those outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and the Italian Government, and His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome is, on my instructions, continuing his efforts to induce the Italian Government to adopt a more satis factory attitude in this respect. But even if directly anti-British Italian propaganda in the Middle East were brought to an end, the more innocent Italian propaganda activities, which I have mentioned, are likely to continue to the detriment of His Majesty’s Government, who are considering the desirability of taking such steps as may be possible to develop their own activities in a corresponding direction, and to devise counter-propaganda of an effective kind.” Unfortunately, the despatch went on to say, the headings under which such counter-propaganda could be developed were limited. The question of a British broadcasting service in Arabic was under examination, as also the possibility of facilitating the use of impartial and accurate text-books in Moslem schools in the Middle East, and His Majesty’s Government were prepared to consider the question—admittedly difficult—of trying to induce British shipping lines to arrange for British vessels to call at Saudi ports, in view of the fact that well- appointed Italian ships were, it was believed, to call at Jedda more frequently than in the past. Finally, the despatch instructed Sir R. Bullard to report whether he considered any, and if so what, possibilities were open for the develop ment of British counter-propaganda in Saudi Arabia, more particularly with a view to counteracting any ill effects which Italian propaganda, whether legitimate or illegitimate, might have on British prestige. 149. On this difficult question Sir R. Bullard first sent an interim reply, giving it as his opinion that unless some solution of the Palestine problem could be found that would be accepted by the great majority of Moslems in Palestine and other Arab territories in the Near and Middle East, nothing that we could do in the way of propaganda would have much effect. At the same time he recom mended a discreet and fair-minded use of wireless broadcasting. This was followed up in April by a despatch expressing views which were eventually approved by the Secretary of State. It began by suggesting that if Italian pro paganda was having some success, it was less because of the propaganda itself than because Italy was in a much more favourable situation than His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Arab world, and mentioned what appeared to39 Sir R. Bullard to be the most important advantages enjoyed by Italy over the British Empire in this respect, viz. :— “ (1) It is we who are imposing the detested Zionist policy on Palestine. (2) Italy is the friend of Germany, who has put the Jews in their place. Many Arabs are ‘ anti-Semites ’ apart from the Zionist question especially the Moslems of French North Africa, where under French protection the Jews have emerged from the Ghetto and acquired wealth and social position on a scale very galling to the Moslem, whose anti- Jew feeling goes gack to Mohammed. . (3) In the struggle about Ethiopia Italy appears to the east to have inflicted a defeat on a large group of Powers led by His Majesty’s Govern ment ; and in the east it is force that counts. . (4) It is true that Italy has a bad record in Tripoli and is now ruler ot Moslems in Ethiopia, but she is striving hard to cover up the past m the first case, and is able, with some show of reason, to represent herself in the other as having rescued the Moslems from a barbarous non-Moslem Government. In any case both these countries aie farther from the centre of things than those territories of the Near and Middle East with which we have special relations, from the treaty arrange ments with Egypt and Iraq, through the apparently eternal mandate on Palestine and complete possession of the new colony of Aden, to the vaguer rights which we possess over the Arab States of the 1 ersian Gulf. ^ The main wave of Arab Nationalist feeling finds itself restrained by Great Britain, and has too much to do in assaulting those immediate bariers to trouble much at present about the leefs in distant Italian Tripoli and Ethiopia. (5) In Spain the Moors are fighting on the same side as the Italians and taking revenge on the Spanish Government for the defeat of Granada over four centuries ago.” The form of propaganda of which we had had most reason to complain in Jedda viz the distribution of Arabic newspapers by the Italian Legation, had been in abeyance for some months, and Sir R. Bullard suggested (wrongly as it turned out)' that a practice which had been adopted in the heat of the Ethiopian crisis would perhaps not be resorted to in less abnormal times. The purchase of newspapers and politicians was anti-British enough, both in purpose and in effect but we could not stop that nor compete with it, nor even prove to the world that it went on. Some instruments of propaganda, such as the exhibition of films and the provision of schools, could not be used in Saudi Arabia, Italian shipping in the Red Sea was less impressive than had been expected, and anyhow only affected the single port of Jedda; the Italian wireless was so biased that it would tend to discredit itself; the propaganda by means of aviation had not been welcome; and the subsidising of pilgrims, who boasted of the subsidy as proof of Italian benevolence, might arouse suspicion of Italian motives. In any case, Sir R Bullard suggested, it would be difficult for us to compete with the Italians on their lines The ordinary Englishman would have to change his character to be the national tub-thumper the Italian seemed to be by instinct. Moreover, he said, “Fascist propaganda, with its simple doctrines of discipline and force, has the more nebulous British appeal at a disadvantage, just as to compare great thing with greater—Christianity in pagan Afiica finds itself at a dis advantage m comparison with Islam, with its complete hiik of philosophy, its offer of a material heaven, and its five simple rules which postulate no virtue except charity to the poor.” 150. Sir R. Bullard did not feel well qualified to advise as to the type of book to be used in schools in the Middle East. It had been well obseived, he remarked, that teaching methods mattered at least as much as the books used. In an England dominated by Germany it might be possible to impose the use of Mein Kamvf as a text-book, but if the teachers were English the product would hardly conform to Nazi standards. Perhaps profit could be drawn from a suggestion made by Mr. F. S. Marvin that in school text-books in all countries stress should be laid on matters of common concern to all nations, such as the ti nimphs of science the spread of socialised medicine, the community of great art, the spread of intercourse by aviation, and the many oihei things which derive, from allwmmmmmmammmmite 40 nations and from which they all derive beneht. Applying this suggestion to the problem in hand, Sir R. Bullard said : “ It offers advantages sub specie ceternitatis and even in the narrower light of the fact that a survey drawn up on such lines would have to give an honourable place to the British. If the suggestion seems unpractical, I would ask whether books consciously designed with the main inten tion of making students pro-British are likely to be successful. If the teaching is on imperialistic lines it may repel the student by its very nature, and it will have to compete with the much better organised foe of its own kind, Italian propaganda; while propaganda resting on any spiritual values discernible in the British character or British institutions will sooner or later lead the student to apply Areopagitica and Mills's Liberty to his own case.” 151. In conclusion, Sir R. Bullard pointed out that British influence was still more in evidence than Italian in Jedda, which, except for the oil-fields of Hasa, is the only point at which Saudi Arabia comes into direct contact with the west, and enumerated a number of items in support of this contention, from the much greater British share in the pilgrim traflic to the fact that, when Ibn Sand wanted an engineer whom he could trust to set up a new lighting plant in his palace at Riyadh, he borrowed an Englishman from the staff of His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda. In Jedda British influence rested largely on a factor which the Italians still had to prove that they possessed, the integrity of the average “ Briton.'’ Unless we could help Saudi Arabia in the matter of armaments and (less probably) aviation, there seemed to be no form of propaganda, except wireless broadcasting, which we should be permitted to do here, and which would be at the same time useful and in conformity with our customs. As to the point in which Italy has the great advantage over us, viz., our relative positions with regard to the Arab world, all that we could do was to try to preserve our essential interests within the limits of a policy which would be the least vulnerable to open or covert attacks from Italian sources. 152. On several occasions during the year a representative of the Italian Embassy in London made enquiries at the Foreign Office as to the policy of His Majesty s Government in Arabia. The peg on which the enquiries were hung was usually weak {e.g., the visit of Captain Seager, frontier officer in the Aden Pro tectorate, to Sanaa, Mr. Philby’s latest journey, and the visit of the Royal Air Force aeroplanes to Jedda in June), and there Was no difficulty in explaining all the incidents quoted. Two points were noticeable at such interviews : the Italians may perhaps be as suspicious of us as we are of them; and, secondly, on every occasion the Italian representative affirmed the intention of the Italian Govern ment to adhere strictly to the Rome Understanding of 1927, and expressed the hope that this was also the policy of His Majesty’s Government. The most categorical assurances as to the adherence of His Majesty’s Government to the Rome Understanding were given by the Foreign Office whenever that point was raised. 153. The international status of the islands in that part of the Red Sea lying to the southward of a line drawn at approximately latitude 18° N. formed the subject of an important memorandum by the Admiralty which was received in January. The memorandum pointed out that, although the Farsan Islands are under the effective sovereignty of Ibn Baud, it is recognised as a mutual Anglo-Italian interest, in article 4 of the Rome Understanding, that no European Power should establish itself on those islands, and that they should not fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. The other islands dealt with in the memo randum lie outside Saudi Arabia, but it may be mentioned, as affecting Italian relations with His Majesty’s Government, that there are Italian police posts, nominally for the protection of a person holding a fishing concession from the Government of Eritrea, on Great Hanish and Jabal Zuqar Islands. Towards the end of the yeai the Admiralty, acting on a report that Italian activities in those regions were increasing, made an investigation which found no confirmation of the news. Turkey. 154. It is convenient to record here a reference to Turco-Arab relations which was made by the Turkish Premier in a public speech in December 1936. Certain elements in Syria, General Inonu said, professed to see in Turkey’s41 attitude on the Alexandretta question an attempt by what they called the Arabs’ traditional enemies to steal a part of the Arab heritage. This was not the case. Turkey was not the enemy of the Arabs. If Arabs had suffered under the Ottoman regime, so had Turks, and, moreover, in many cases the guiding force in the administration of the Sultans had been Arab, and not Turk. Again, Turkey had stood out consistently after the war against the establishment of mandates over the Arabs, and had wished them to direct their own destinies. Republican Turkey, too, had officially adopted as its policy the principle of leaving the Arab countries to the Arabs, but she would not agree that the Arabs should be in a position to draw away from their Turkish nationality a population of a region bordering on Turkey. 155. Ibn Saud’s anxiety about Alexandretta, to which reference was made last year (paragraph 109), found expression in January, when he sent Fuad Bey with a message to His Majesty’s Minister, to say that lie was receiving telegrams from all parts of the world urging him to do something about Alexandretta, and that he would be grateful for the advice of His Majesty’s Government: he did not wish to disturb his good relations with the Turks, but what was he to do? How would it be if he appealed to the Turks? Speaking in language which was subsequently approved by the Secretary of State, Sir R. Bullard said that, so far as his knowledge went, His Majesty’s Government considered that Alexandretta ought to remain within the Syrian group of territories, and were bending their efforts to that end. If His Majesty made an appeal to the Turks, they might ask what standing Saudi Arabia had in the matter. The appeal might arouse memories of the Arab revolt and make the Turks more, instead of less, difficult. 156. Fuad Bey then spoke of the King’s suspicion of Turkey, of which the Legation had already had evidence from time to time; the King believed that Turkey had never really abandoned her claim to Mosul and its oil, and that, if she had her way with Alexandretta, it would encourage her in her policy towards Iraq. Fuad Bey said that he himself had received assurances when he went to Angora that Turkey did not covet any Arab territory, but her Alexandretta policy was in conflict with those assurances. Sir R. Bullard, after pointing out that the basis of the Turkish claim w T as that the population of the Alexandretta region was not Arab but Turkish, uttered a warning against the dangerous confusion which might result from the use of the phrase “ Arab world ” in two different ways. There was an Arab world in the sense that there were communities Arab in language and Moslem in religion which might have certain sympathies in common, but Fuad Bey seemed to be using the phrase as though it represented a political entity which was called upon to take action whenever the interests of any Arabs anywhere were affected. This seemed a dangerous doctrine and likely to cause serious trouble if acted upon. Fuad Bey ought not to be misled by the case of the appeal of the Arab rulers on the Palestine question, which had a strictly limited application, and where, moreover, the other party concerned was the United Kingdom Government, whose sympathies in regard to Arabs were well known. It would be a fatal mistake to suppose that interven tion on behalf of Arab interests could always be made with advantage, and would always be well received. Fuad Bey said that these views did not differ essentially from his, but the King wanted to know the views of His Majesty’s Government. 157. In reporting on this interview, Sir R. Bullard said that he had received the impression that the King and Fuad Bey had been brought face to face with reality and that this had given them a salutary shock. Ibn Saud had just intervened in regard to Palestine, but the Alexandretta problem was more difficult. He could not suppose that Kamal Ataturk’s policy would be influenced by an appeal from the King of Saudi Arabia, but must realise that the Arab case depended mainly upon France and Great Britain, and not at all upon himself and his Arab fellow rulers. This realisation, Sir R. Bullard hoped, might come to other Arabs also, and tend to discourage the wilder pan-Arab schemes and to spread the conviction that it would be better for the Arabs in the long run not to try to upset the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the Near and Middle East. 158. Ibn Saud made a similar move in Bagdad. According to a statement made to His Majesty’s Ambassador by the Iraq Foreign Minister, the Saudi42 Charge d’Affaires had enquired in the name of King Abdul Aziz whether any joint action about Alexandretta was desirable, and the Foreign Minister had replied, in writing, that the Iraqi Government, in the early stages of the dispute, had tried to exercise a moderating inffuenee both at Angora and at Damascus, but that now that the League had produced a satisfactory solution there was no longer any need for the Arab countries to consider taking action in the matter. Ibn Saud expressed his fears in person at one of the conversations in March, and the guardedly reassuring reply which he received from Mr. Ilendel did not prevent his reviving the subject in May by telegraphing to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who was then in London. The King believed, said Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, that the Turks were anti-Arab and that the situation was dangerous for the Arabs and for His Majesty’s Government. He begged His Majesty’s Government to do their best to protect Arab interests at the impending Council meeting at Geneva. For his part, he would use a moderating influence with the Syrians. If His Majesty’s Government were determined to be friends with Turkey at all costs he would do his best to fit in with that policy, but he must point out the dangers of the situation. Mr. Rendel again gave a reassuring reply. There was now a reasonable guarantee that the sanjak would never be detached from the rest of Syria and that the frontier would be maintained, and if the Turks had ever cherished expansionist ambitions towards Aleppo and Mosul, those ambitions had received a severe check. King Abdul Aziz could be assured that His Majesty’s Government would do their best, and if they supported any particular settlement it was because nothing better was to be obtained. Mr. Rendel was discouraging to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin when he asked what would be the position if the Syrians refused to accept any settlement which might be reached at Geneva. That would be most unfortunate, he said; if the Syrians rejected a League decision it might seriously affect their admission to the League and the attainment of their independence, while the Turks, for their part, might take the law into their own hands. Mr. Rendel refused to be drawn into an argument on the basis laid by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that if there was a war Turkey would be against Great Britain and the Arabs. 159. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin brought up the subject at the Foreign Office once more, after the settlement had been effected. Fie himself thought the settlement the best that could be obtained and did not think the King would question that view; but the King wished to warn His Majesty’s Government once more of the danger to be expected from Turkish designs on Arab lands. To this Mr. Rendel again gave a reasonably hopeful reply. Sheikh Yusuf then stated that the Turks were strongly pressing the Amir Saud, then in England for the Coronation, to return through Turkey, and he suspected that the object was to appear to have Ibn Saud’s support for their Syrian policy. Mr. Rendel, while disclaiming any wish to give advice in the matter, said that His Majesty’s Government would welcome any rapprochement between Turks and Arabs, and that, from that point of view, the Turkish suggestion had much to be said for it. In the end, however, the suggested visit did not take place. 160. The suggestions of His Majesty’s Government led Ibn Saud to advise the Syrians strongly to maintain the best possible relations with Turkey. He infoimed the Foreign Office of this through the Saudi Minister in London, but complained at the same time that the Turkish press had been carrying on a strong anti-Arab campaign and asked for the good offices of His Majesty’s’Government with the luikish Government with a view to securing its discontinuance. On instructions from His Majesty s Government, His Majesty’s Ambassador in Turkey made representations to the Turkish Prime Minister,' who said that they appieciated Ibn Saud s action and agreed and would act accordingly. The Ambassador added, however, that he had not endorsed the complaint about the attitude of the Tuikish pi ess, as for some time it had done little but reproduce anti-Turkish statements from the Syrian press. 161. Ibn Saud s advice to the Syrians had been conveyed by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Jamil Mardam. President of the Council in Syria, at Geneva, and Sheikh Yusuf biought back word to the foreign Office that the Syrians proposed to take this advice and to remain quiet for the next two years, in answer to an enquiiy whether this meant that after two years the Syrians would cease to be quiet, Sheikh \usuf Yasm said no; the time-limit merely referred to the period of the continuance of the mandate. ^43 162. Very few Turks now come on pilgrimage. It would be almost, if not quite, impossible for a Turk to be allowed to leave Turkey if he openly declared the pilgrimage to be the object of his journey, since the authorities would consider that the object did not warrant the export of the foreign currency required. The Saudi statistics showed fifty-five Turkish subjects as having made the pilgrimage, but none of them applied to the Turkish Legation in Jedda for a return visa as they would have had to do if they had come in the regular way. Egypt- 163. In virtue of the Saudi-Egyptian Treaty of May 1936, a Saudi Legation was established in Egypt with effect from the 27th December, 1936, with the former Saudi agent in Egypt as Charge d’Affaires and consul-general; and an Egyptian Legation was established in Jedda as from the 17th January, 1937. The Egyptian Minister, Abdul Rahman Azzam, who was appointed to Saudi Arabia in 1936 in addition to diplomatic duties in several other capitals in the Middle East, did not come to Jedda during the year and his legation remained in the charge of a Charge d’Affaires. 164. The circumstances attending the arrival and stay of the Egyptian Mahmal mission in the Hejaz tended to bear out the opinion expressed before hand in a despatch from the Legation, that the acceptance by Ibn Saud of the despatch of the Mahmal as far as Jedda could only be considered as a device to save the face of the Egyptian Government to some extent. The mission, which was led by the President of the Senate and included other prominent Egyptians, had no official reception at Jedda other than that afforded by the presence of an aide-de-camp to the Amir Faisal and a few down-at-heel police—a striking contrast to the imposing ceremonial with which the Mahmal was despatched from Egypt. The Hejaz press referred to the arrival of the “ Mission of Honour ” but did not mention the word “ Mahmal.” The President of the Mission delivered a speech at Mecca in the presence of Ibn Saud in which he referred with satis faction to “ the return to the old system of the despatch of the holy Kiswa to the revered Kaba by the Egyptian Government in accordance with the tradition of the Kings, Sultans and rulers of Egypt since distant ages,” but the Kiswa was not handed over then but delivered to the Mosque officials on an occasion not advertised beforehand and in a manner which seemed calculated to diminish its importance. In November it was announced in the Egyptian press that the Mahmal would not go beyond Suez for the 1938 pilgrimage, though the Kiswa would be sent to Jedda to be forwarded to Mecca. This probably marks the end of the Mahmal so far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, but whether this was provided for by private arrangement with Ibn Saud in 1936, or whether the cool reception of the Mahmal in Jedda disappointed the Egyptian Government and was regarded as a rebuff, is not known. It may be that the view has prevailed which was expressed by some members of the Egyptian Chamber of Deputies when a bill providing a credit of £E. 33,856 for expenses connected with the despatch of the Mahmal to Jedda was approved, viz., that the expenditure was no longer justified, the procedure having lost its meaning in modern conditions and having been deprived of its prestige value by the limita tions imposed by Ibn Saud. 165. The most likely explanation is that the final abandonment of the custom of sending the Mahmal was provided for at the time of the Agreement of 1936, with the limited ceremonial of the 1937 pilgrimage as a half-way house. Certainly there has been no friction visible as a result of anything the Saudi authorities did or did not do to the “ Mission of Honour,” and relations between the two Governments seem to be good. The tendency observed in 1936 for Saudi Arabia to look to Egypt for help in providing trained personnel for various purposes was continued in 1937. Besides several schoolmasters the Saudi Govern ment obtained from Egypt an expert to advise them about their date groves in Hasa and another about date-packing in Medina, and Egypt was one of the Moslem countries from which Ibn Saud was thinking that a military expert might be obtained. The renewal of the allocation of Egyptian waqf funds to charitable purposes in the Hejaz enabled the two Governments to agree upon a scheme which should benefit the Heiaz in general and not merely destitutes; it is agreed that half of the sum which would formerly have been spent on wheat for free distribution in the Hejaz shall be used to supplement Saudi funds for44 road-making, introducing or improving electricity and water schemes, and so on. The Banque Misr, after building a hotel in Jedda which is modern in form if not in administration, has built in Mecca for the account of the Saudi Government an immense hotel with such luxuries as baths and a lift. Egyptian finance benefits by a scheme by which the Banque Misr collects an inclusive charge from Egyptian pilgrims and holds at the disposal of the Saudi Government, who draw on it by means of cheques, the proportion of the payments which represents the koshan and the Government’s share of the cost of transport. The Banque Misr has perhaps been a little too successful, and there have been rumours that the Saudi Government rather resent its desire to have a finger in every pie. Soviet Russia. 166. According to M. Khakimoff his efforts to secure payment for the oil products supplied to the Saudi Government seven years or so ago were at last successful. He informed His Majesty’s Minister in May that he had received an order on Banque Misr for the payment every month of one-twelfth of the sum due until the whole should be paid off. 167. After having been closed for some considerable time the dispensary of the Soviet Legation was reopened in April. The new doctor, M. Stepukoff, knew only Russian when he arrived. He informed His Majesty’s Minister soon after his arrival that he was swamped with patients, sometimes as many as eighty in a day, but in November he said that his daily attendance was twenty to thirty (this was at a time when the British Indian doctor attached to His Majesty’s Legation was seeing some two hundred patients a day). 168. The members of the Soviet Legation frequent local houses assiduously, and it is remarked that they learn colloquial Arabic quickly. Mme. Fattahov, wife of the secretary and herself a Turkish-speaking Moslem, spent several months during the summer staying with the Turkish wife of the Amir Faisal. 169. The Saudi Minister in London informed the Foreign Office at one moment that if His Majesty’s Government could not assist Ibn Saud in the matter of aviation he might be compelled to accept a Soviet air mission, but this was apparently a mistake (see paragraph 203). Spain. 170. But for the civil war it is unlikely that Spain would have meant much to Saudi Arabia for a long while to come. Such pilgrims as ever came from the Spanish Zone of Morocco used to be dealt with in Jedda by the French Legation, there being no representative of the Spanish Government in Saudi Arabia. The Franco Government, however, decided by way of propaganda to subsidise the journey to Mecca of a certain number of pilgrims from the Spanish Zone of Morocco, by giving them passages to Jedda at very low rates, on a vessel flying the flag of the insurgent Government, and a Spanish subject of Lebanese origin was sent to Jedda to deal with these pilgrims, though he was soon withdrawn and the work of supervision was handed over to the Italian Legation. The Legation assimilated them to their Libyan pilgrims, who arrived and left by the same steamer. 171. Fuad Bey consulted His Majesty’s Minister about the international aspect of this affair. He said that the Spanish subject mentioned above had made approaches to the Saudi Government about a year before, when the Spanish Government had proposed to enter into diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, but the Saudi Government saw no advantage in concluding an arrangement, and the negotiations were still dragging on when the civil war broke out. According to Fuad Bey, the Italian Legation has asked some weeks before, on behalf of General Franco, whether the Saudi Government would receive and give facilities for pilgrims from the Spanish Zone of Morocco, and the Saudi Government had given the obvious reply that all Moslems were welcome to the House of Allah, and soon. They had no intention of recognising the Franco Government, towards which they were in the same position as towards the Italian conquest of Ethiopia. Eventually the leaders of the body of pilgrims from the Spanish Zone, who brought gifts of some value for the King and other persons of importance, were45 received at the offices of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Jedda and apparently entertained to lunch; but this treatment might be given to any pilgrims of note. In any case, there was no reason why the Saudi Government should take sides in the matter, when their religious principles and their economic interests both require them to encourage the flow of pilgrims to the Hejaz, whatever their nationality. The Spanish Moors, or some of them, earned thir money by speaking in favour of General Franco, hut the propaganda does not seem to have attracted very much notice. Jr an. 172. The Iranian Legation was reopened only three weeks before the pilgrimage day, and was closed again at the earliest possible moment. The Minister himself was in Jedda only about three weeks. The Secretary spoke openly of the journey of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca as a dead financial loss to their country. Saudi statistics show that only twenty-two Iranians made the pilgrimage this year. United States of America. 173. Mr. Leland B. Morris, United States consul-general at Alexandria, came to Jedda in January for a few days to study the question of American interests and the alleged need for official representation in Saudi Arabia. His visit was short and did not even allow him to visit the gold mine. The informa tion he collected included generous contributions from the British Legation. United States interests, which are confined to a controlling financial interest in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited) and to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company working in Hasa, are hardly likely to induce the United States Government to set up a Legation here, and the most important American citizen in Jedda, Mr. Twitched, the managing director of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, has been heard to declare that the United States Government interests in this country would not justify the appointment of an American official to protect them. Japan. 174. Japan is still not represented officially in Saudi Arabia. Three Japanese Moslems came on the pilgrimage. It was credibly reported that they showed great activity in propaganda among the merchants at Mecca, saying that Japanese rather than European goods should be bought in view of the pro-Islamic tendencies of present-day Japan. This commercial propaganda is hardly necessary, as the cheapness of Japanese goods enables them to command the market in this country. 175. The Japanese victories in China seem to have made some impression in Jedda. One gossip circle was heard representing them as victories of the coloured races (among whom the Arabs were included) over the white, and the attack on China as having for its object to set China free from the British and the Americans. (C)—Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 176. If Ibn Sand ever had any desire to join the League of Nations, that desire has completely disappeared. There are indications that he regards it as acquiescing in policies unjust to the Arabs of Alexandretta and of Palestine. 177. The Saudi Government continued their attack (paragraph 120 of 1936) on the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926 in so far as it imposes “exceptional ” quarantine measures on pilgrims travelling to or from Mecca. They, however, communicated to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom their accession to the rules governing the action of submarines with regard to merchant ships in time of war set out in the proces-verbal signed in London on the 6th November, 1936, thereby effacing the impression reported in paragraph 121 of the report for 1936 that they did not desire to participate in international accords which do not affect their own interests; they were represented at theFifteenth International Ophthalmic Conference, which was held in Cairo in December; acting on the private suggestion from His Majesty’s Legation, they remedied a defect in the Saudi regulation on narcotic drugs which was issued in September 1934; and when acknowledging the thanks of His Majesty’s Govei nment for the assistance rendered to Mr. Maxwell Darling (paragraph 121 of 1936) they expressed their readiness to do anything in their power to assist m the anti-locust campaign. 178- (p))— Treaties.

It is not necessary to be a Marxist to place a paragraph about the economic situation first in this section. Ibn Saud’s financial position is not good an cl he is acutely conscious of that fact and of its bearing upon the stability or his regime and upon his reputation in the countries whose pilgrims he taxes so heavily. No important improvement in this respect falls to be mentioned this year, except the reported discovery of water for the working of the Cot-of-Gold Mine, albeit in conditions which involve the use of pumps. Overtures by the Saudi Government to the Selection trust (Limited) for the grant of a concession loi minerals in an area next to that covered by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate s concession came to nothing : the period to be allowed for prospecting was too short and the sum required to be paid down (£50,000) was too large, liie Hasa oil-held yielded no oil in commercial quantities, and the intention of the °J man A 1 rab 1 ian Standard Oil Company, to drill one well to the depth of 4,000 feet, m the hope of finding such stores of oil as they had found in a similar formation m the Island of Bahrein, still remained to be carried out when the year ended. I he Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) Company (Limited) began boring for oil m the larsan Islands, but did not get very far, and they did not find the outlook encouraging. The pilgrimage of 1936-37 was larger than that of the preceding year, while that of 1937-38 promised to be larger still and the increased income from this source must have been welcome. Some assistance was promised from the Fgyptian waqfs, half of whose remittances were set aside as a contribution towards certain public works, in particular the construction of roads, for the benefit of pilgrims. An improvement in the roads would attract more pilgrims and also, by lengthening the life of cars, enable large economies to be effected, trade continued to be poor. This is widely attributed in the47 Hejaz to the policy of the Government in taking so large a proportion of e pilgrim dues that the large classes of people who live, or used to live, on me pilgrimage, now have little to spend. Attempts to encourage exports aye resulted in little but an alleged growth in the figures of skins exported, whicn, it real, is probably due to the closing of the Abyssinian source of supply to non- Italian dealers, and in a scheme for selling little boxes of dates to pdgrams as a memento of the Holy Land. This date business was part of the Piastre Scheme,” which, in spite of strong appeals to residents and pilgrims to subscribe, produced in its first year a sum of only about £500. 1 here are four more or less official companies at work, but what they do is obscure, though not more obscure than the balance sheets which they publish from time to time. A second motor- transport company has been established, to work between the Hejaz and JNejd, but both its finances and its material had a bad beginning. A little boring tor water in the Heiaz is being effected, but like everything else here it is on a small scale. There is still an unseemly contrast between the general poverty on the one hand and the expenditure of the King and his family an entourage on the other. Ibn Baud eats and dresses simply, like the early caliphs, but there seems to be nc control of the Royal expenditure in other respects. Competition between the sons and between the womenfolk seems to lead to extravagance. I he list o motor vehicles which the four eldest sons alone possess is staggei i^S- ® ^ Chamberlain, for whom the good offices of officials in India were sought, was attei- wards found to have gone to India by air, with an assistant and a \eiy s . u ? 1 of money, mainly to buy stuffs for the ladies of the palace. I he pay of officials is low and they do not receive it regularly, but the Royal servants and slaves seem to have plenty of money and when the court comes to Jedda they buy up everything in the bazaar and create a small “ season.” In the market m Riyadh it is possible to buy luxuries, such as sporting cartridges, lemons imported tor the Kind’s use from Taif, &amp;c., all of which have almost openly been taken by the servants°and slaves as perquisites and sold. The only condition laid down by the King seems to be that when he wants money the Minister of Finance had to produce it somehow. 180 The maintenance of order continued to be the most striking feature of Ibn Baud’s rule. It is admitted that this has been secured by swift and rapid punishment of offenders, sometimes by the imposition of penalties out of pro portion to the offence. The cutting off of hands and feet for theft is a Koranic penalty, and the supporters of Ibn Baud are perhaps right in saying that the total number of punishments of this order does not exceed 150 for the whole kingdom, and that they have not only reduced crimes of theft almost to nothing but have prevented crimes of violence also; but it is something of a shock to lea in fiom Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that a number of men were shot recently for smuggling. The murder of a boy in Jedda was followed by the speedy discovery and public execution of the culprit, and if the methods of detection, carried out under threats of the Kind’s displeasure if the murderer escaped, were primitive, and included a promise to the accused that he would suffer nothing worse than a short period of imprisonment if he confessed, the King would problably claim that the greatest disaster would be that murderer should go unpunished and that British judicial methods would not work here. An affray between some of the Royal slaves and the police occurred in Mecca, owing, it appears, to the habit these slaves had of ignoring the speed limit, and there was some bloodshed; but what happened m the end never became known. 181 There is no record of tribal raiding or pursuit of blood feuds during the year Mr Philby states that although he travelled all through Najran, which was formerly never at peace, he never heard a shot fired, except by people shooting for the pot Saudi control in the south was so well established that the Amir of jizan was able to issue an order, which is said to have been welcomed by the population that in the matter of circumcision the tradition of the Prophet must be followed in future; boys would be circumcised at an early age, and the barbarous custom of effecting a much more extensive operation, in public, as a test of courage would be abandoned. Ibn Baud continued his policy of concilia tion and released Bandar-al-Duwish, the senior surviving member of the Mutair tribe who had been kept in Riyadh under supervision. It is credibly reported that ibn Baud offered him the Amirship of Artawiya, the Mutair Ikhwan settle ment and that Bandar refused, preferring to lead a nomadic life. According48 to the Political Agent at Koweit more and more is heard among tribal people of the possibility of a revolt in Nejd if Ibn Sand should die or his powers fail. It is often said, he reports, that a pact exists between the Ajman (Ibn Hithlain, mentioned in paragraph 125 of the report for 1936), the Mutair (Al-Duwish) and the Ataina (Ibn Humdaid), to take concerted action as soon as opportunity offers. Two prominent tribal leaders still show no sign of wanting Ibn Saud’s pardon : Naif-bin-Humaid, of the Ataiba, who is still in Iraq, and Mutlaq-al-Sur of the Mutair, who remains in Koweit. 182. To what extent law and order are stable in tribal areas, and to what extent they are maintained only by the knowledge that Ibn Sand is on the watch, it would be difficult to say with any certainty. That Ibn Baud relies upon the Nejdis, and especially upon his own family, to maintain order is shown by an interesting list of the amirs of the principal centres in Saudi Arabia, which was compiled in February by the Officer Commanding Desert Patrol in Transjordan. He gave a list of over twenty centres, and showed that the most important amirates were occupied by members of the Saud family, or by Sudairis, of the family of Ibn Saud’s mother, and that all the rest were filled by other Nejdis. Nejdis also occupy nearly all the posts in the frontier control. 183. Ibn Saud told His Majesty’s Minister at Riyadh that the air force which he desired to form was wanted to help in the maintenance of internal order. 184. What appeared to be a storm in a teacup was mentioned in the Saut-al-Hejaz, which reported with bitter comments the publication in an Egyptian newspaper called Misr of an article by a Copt, Salama Musa, stating that a society called “ The Friends of the Hejaz ” had been formed, having for its objects to publish complaints from Hejazis and to strive for the independence of the Hejaz. His Majesty’s Minister could not believe that any Hejazis resident in the Hejaz would venture to join such a society, though he admitted the existence of a Hejazi grievance, viz., that except in the matter of public security the Hejaz is worse off than ever before, owing to the fact that the income from the pilgrimage, which for centuries had been the perquisite of the Hejaz, now had to support the whole of Saudi Arabia. His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo reported that the Society of the Friends of the Hejaz need not be taken seriously, and that it appeared to be run by a certain Sheikh Yusuf-al-Zawawi, a fanatical Hejazi inspired with a hatred of Wahabi rule who obtained Dutch nationality in Java and hoped to use it to protect him from trouble either with the Egyptian or Saudi authorities. A Hejazi student who had just returned from Egypt was reported to have been discovered writing to Salama Musa, but it appears that Ibn Saud was eventually convinced that there was little in the “ Friends of the Hejaz ” movement. He is said, however, to have given a severe warning to the members of the Legislative Assembly and other Hejazi notables before he left for Riyadh after the pilgrimage, that any disloyalty would meet with the severest punishment. 185. The religious policy of Ibn Saud calls for special attention this year. It is perhaps legitimate to attribute this activity at least in part to his desire to accentuate the sacred character of the Hejaz and particularly of Mecca and its unsuitability as a centre for political propaganda—an excuse which he says he gave when the Italians wanted to elicit from him a statement approving of their pro-Moslem policy and when the Arab Nationalists wished to hold a congress in Mecca. He made a declaration of orthodoxy at a banquet which he gave to a large number of distinguished Indian pilgrims after the pilgrimage. After speaking in his usual manner about Allah and the Prophet and the Koran he said :— “ As to the prescriptions of the sects, we are not against them in any thing. They are all our sects, whether Hanafi, or Shafai, or Maliki, or Hanbali. Our sect is based on proof wherever it may be found (i.e., in the Koran or the traditions of the Prophet), and if proof is lacking and there is nothing to follow but ‘ ijtihad ’ (deduction or interpretation by'a person of learning), then we follow the ‘ ijtihad ’ of Ahmad-bin-Hanbal.” A similar statement was made by Ibn Saud in the course of a private interview which he gave to his Highness the Khan of Kelat. According to the Indian vice-49 consul, who was present, the King declared that he was a Hanbali, but that he respected the other three founders of the Sunni sects and had adopted various points from their teaching. Not long afterwards Ibn Saud issued a ‘ Back to Religion ” proclamation reproving people who call themselves Moslems, but follow imaginings and vices created by the devil—“ modernisation, freedom, “civilisation” and so on. To such people progress meant civilisation and freedom, and obedience to the Koran and to the commands of the Prophet reaction. Such people were acting against their religion and the interests of the Arabs. Particularly disgraceful was it that women should associate with men on the pretext of “ progress,” abandoning the duties for which they were created for self-adornment and the frequentation of immoral places. Young men who claimed to be educated should take warning from the immoralities of other countries. The King had felt it his duty as a Moslem and an Arab to give this advice to those over whom Allah had made him a ruler, and to be patient under any criticism which might be directed against him. Anything right he had said was from Allah, and anything wrong (for which Allah forgive him !) was from himself and the devil. 186. This proclamation had perhaps been prompted by the scare created by the news about the “Friends of the Hejaz ” Society, for there were few signs in Jedda of a craving for modernisation. The references to women, however, came from a settled policy. This is a point on which Ibn Saud feels very strongly, and on which no modification is possible. It was stated that during the forth coming pilgrimage season all women pilgrims would be required to wear complete wrappings such as the Hejaz women wear, though no notice to that effect was published, and Egyptian women at least went about in Jedda unveiled. I he hand of the King in this respect was sufficiently heavy to oblige several young Moslem women of modern education, wives of officials of foreign legations, to live in almost complete seclusion in Jedda. Other signs of what an outsider might consider a reactionary policv were contained in regulations forbidding the shaving of the beard and the importation and sale of any representation m three dimensions of any living thing. The regulation about beards at first gave some trouble to foreign Moslems and brought in a fair sum to the Saudi authorities m fines. In reply to an enquiry from His Majesty’s Legation the Ministry for Foreign Affairs stated that the regulation did not apply to Moslem visitors or pilgrims or to non-Moslems, but only to Moslems resident m the sacred territory^ The other regulation was apparently prompted bv the discovery that some of the children in Mecca had dolls, toy rabbits and the like to play with. 187. A story which had appeared in an Egyptian newspaper, that the kissing of the Black Stone was forbidden by the Saudi authorities, was denied officially. The Grand Qadhi of Mecca cited with approval the relevant traditions, and maintained that pilgrims must be allowed to touch the Black Stone. An article in the Umm-al-Qura attributed the accusation to the fact that policemen are posted in the Haram to protect pilgrims and their property, and that a policeman is stationed near the Black Stone, where the crowd is particularly thick, to prevent congestion and to arrange for people to kiss the stone without disputing with one another. 188. Signs of change in the direction of toleration were noticed here and there. It is reported that whereas in the early days after the Wahabi conquest pilgrims who showed particular respect to the tomb of the 1 rophet at Medina were liable to be beaten or at least driven away, they can now resell, and even kiss, the railing round it at the cost of a small tip to the policeman on duty. Smoking is becoming more common in Jedda, and is indulged in by many in Hasa and Riyadh, though not too openly. Gramophones, though all those in the hands of Moslems must have been smuggled in in the face of a complete prohibition, are becoming common even in the interior, and advertisements of wireless sets and even mouth-organs can be seen in the Saut-al-Hejaz. It is even said, on good authority, that spirits are distilled and consumed in Riyadh. XV.—Military and Naval Organisation. 189. It appears that there are three main sorts of military forces in this country. The personal retainers and negro guards of the King and the various Amirs, which are known as “ Zikurt ” ; the newly-formed gendarmerie men-50 tioned in last year’s report called “ Shurta ” (believed to be limited to the Hejaz), which seems to be a less personal force than the “ Zikurt,' but is used for very similar duties, such as manning frontier posts and supplementing the head quarters garrisons of the various provincial Amirs in the Hejaz; and the army proper, if it can be so called, which is limited to Mecca, Medina and one or two other of the larger towns. This force, like the “gendarmerie,' is uniformed and undergoes some sort of training in the art of war. But none of these forces really possesses much military value as opposed to police value. 190. Armament seems to consist of a mixed collection of rifles mainly of Mauser pattern and of German and Polish origin. The King’s bodyguard is equipped with some sort of repeating rifle of continental manufacture. In summer the Saudi armament was augmented by the arrival of the arms and ammunition supplied by His Majesty’s Government (paragraph 113 above). This consignment included 18-pounder field guns. Saudi Arabia already possessed some guns, but probably only old war-time stuff left in the country by the Turks. 191. During the year considerable effort was made to organise a proper military control of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier, and probably of the Saudi- Iraq frontier as well. Reports from Transjordan state that the following frontier posts on the Saudi-Transjordan frontier are now in existence, some in masonry or mud forts and some in tents: Haql, Alaqan, Dhat-al-Haj, Fajr, Jauf. Isawiya, Nebk, Haditha and Kaf. Headquarters are at Tebuk and Kaf. For the Saudi-Iraq frontier the posts are as given in last year’s report, at Lauqah, Lina, Umm-al-Radhumma, Hafar-al-Batin and Jeriya. 192. Saudi Arabia still possesses nothing in the way of a naval force. The two dhows mentioned in the 1936 report are still under construction, the larger of the two being almost completed. In June the Saudi Minister in London notified the accession of his country to the rules governing the action of submarines against merchant shipping in time of war contained in the proces-verbal signed in London on the 6th November, 1936. V.—Aviation and Connected Matters. Saudi Air Force. 193. The Saudi force of aeroplanes was increased during the year by the arrival of the remaining two of the three Capronis presented by the Italian Government and by the gift of Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate's Bellanca mono plane by the syndicate after the completion of their air survey. In addition, steps were taken by the purchase of spares and the engagement of a rigger from Egypt to put the four Wapitis in order. Only one of the Wapitis has been flown this year. 194. An air display, which was given to celebrate Ibn Saud's visit to Jedda in December, illustrates the degree of progress made by the Saudi air force. Six machines were in the air, but none of them did anything but straight flying. The pilots were :— 2 Saudis each flying an Italian instructional machine. 1 Saudi flying the French Caudron-Renault. 1 Saudi flying a three-engined Caproni. M. Naidyonoff, the Russian refugee pilot, in the Bellanca. Major Ciccu, the Italian instructor, in a three-engined Caproni. 195. The four Saudis are the best of the ten who were trained in Italy. It is known that no attempt was made in Italy to teach them anything but straight Possibly it was realised that the necessary background of education was lacking, but in any case the Saudi students know little about their engines and nothing about navigation, and they cannot do the simplest trick flying° At the beginning of the year a system of regular training was adopted, and it was even intended to take on a fresh batch of Saudi candidates for training, but this spurt of energy did not last long. The cost of petrol, and later the desire to make the least possible use of Italian help, led to its abandonment. Flying has been spasmodic, and has sometimes been discontinued for weeks at a time.51 196. The “ personal ” request from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin (paragraph 139 of 1936) that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should provide facilities for the training of Saudi pilots in England eventually led to discussions which resulted, at the end of the year, in agreement on a smaller and more s practical scheme. In spite of the curious method of approach, the proposal was, y in fact, from Ibn Saud, who mentioned it at the time of Mr. Rendel’s visit and said that he did not want Italian help and that the pilots trained in Italy were useless. This was followed up by a written request to His Majesty’s Government to assist in arrangements which would give the Saudi Government in the first instance ten military aircraft with pilots, mechanics, workshops and everything else necessary and would allow for gradual expansion. The note asked that the scheme should be studied by experts of His Majesty’s Government to find the most speedy means for the attainment of this object, to decide whether the pilots should be trained abroad or a school should he established in Saudi Arabia, and to state the cost and the conditions of payment. 197. It was not for lack of goodwill that little progress had been made with the scheme. Mr. Rendel made this clear to the King, and spoke of the difficulties from the British side, owing to our rearmament scheme, and from the Saudi side, where owing to the smallness of the urban population it might be difficult to find men with suitable mechanical training for aviation work. Mr. Rendel also pointed out that whereas it might suit the Italian Government to undertake the training of any number of Saudi candidates for the political effect it might have, His Majesty VGovernment would be unwilling to embark upon any scheme which would not have a reasonable chance of success. 198. * So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, there was a strong desire not to adopt an unhelpful attitude, as that might drive the Saudis into the hands of other countries, who might seek to acquire thereby privileges in Saudi Arabia which we could not see granted with equanimity. As early as January the Air Ministry had made suggestions on the subject. They felt unable to support any proposal for bringing Saudi personnel to the United Kingdom for training, either at the Royal Air Force or at civil training establishments. They suggested as a practical alternative the provision of training facilities in the Middle East, preferably in Egypt. The detailed proposals were :■— (1) That a few Saudi pupil pilots should go for training to the civil flying school maintained by Misr-Airwork at Cairo; (2) That a few mechanics should be accepted for free training at the Royal Air Force Depot at Aboukir. In either case, the Air Ministry said, it would be of great importance that the pupils sent for training should know enough English and should have attained a standard of education sufficient to enable them to follow the courses of instruction. They added that a few pilots who satisfactorily completed a course of training at Misr-Airwork might be admitted, either free of charge or at reduced rates, to a course of higher training at No. 4 Flying Training School. 199. The ambitious scheme referred to in paragraph 195 seemed to His Majesty’s Minister so far beyond Saudi capacity that he felt it would be unfair to encourage the Saudi Government to believe that it was feasible. His doubts were based upon the following considerations : — (1) It would be difficult to secure suitable candidates; (2) The aeroplanes would never be properly looked after ; (8) Pilots and mechanics, if trained abroad, would deteriorate rapidly on return to their own country; (4) The Saudi Government have neither the administrative experience, nor the organisation necessary for the maintenance of an air force; (5) The Saudi Government have not the money for such a scheme—though. of course, it was open to His Majesty’s Government to provide some or all of the money if they thought the object of sufficient importance. Sir R. Bullard supported these arguments by facts illustrating the poor results obtained by the Italians, the general lack of education in Saudi Arabia and the complete absence of a proper civil service for the regular administration even of simpler organisations than an air force. He suggested that if His52 Majesty’s Government took a prominent part in Saudi aviation it might encourage the Italians to emhark upon an adventure in the Yemen, as the only place on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea where His Majesty’s Government had not already a footing, and asked whether a modest scheme run by “ neutrals ” might not s the situation best, though he realised that neutrals would work on a cash basis, whereas Ibn Saud evidently w T anted help in a form which would relieve him wholly or partly of the expense. Finally he urged that we should show that we were not being obstructive by doing our best to satisfy the Saudi request for arms (see paragraph 110). 200. The Air Ministry went into the cost of the Saudi scheme very carefully. It was found to be large. A military aeroplane, for instance, would cost at least £5,000 or £6,000, besides spares, &amp;c., wdiieh would add more than £1,000 to the cost of each. An air mission, which they thought should be undertaken not officially, but by a reputable air training company or aircraft manufacturing company, would cost £6,000 a year or more. They feared that the high cost of maintenance had perhaps been overlooked by the Saudi Government, and that any efficiency in air matters attained during the presence of an air mission would deteriorate rapidly when the mission left. They therefore suggested further discussion between the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry, and after an exhaustive examination in May by representatives of the two depart ments “ It was finally agreed that the Foreign Office should inform the Saudi Ministers now in England that we reluctantly were unable to find any practicable method of assisting them in their desire to establish an air force, pointing out the difficulties which were inseparable from such an undertaking, but offering to give further consideration to any constructive suggestions which they might wish to put forward.” The situation was explained to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the Saudi Minister, who, although disappointed, appeared to accept the position and did not contest the arguments. They asked, however, that some scheme, however modest, should be worked out for an embryonic organisation for the training of mechanics and the eventual establishment of a few mechanical workshops. 201. When Sir R. Bullard was in Riyadh in July Ibn Saud referred to the establishment of a Saudi air force as very urgent, and explained that the purpose for which the aeroplanes were wanted was the maintenance of internal order. He added that he wanted to get rid of the Italians and could not think how to do this except by replacing them by a British mission. To a question about “ White ” Russians he replied that M. Naidyonoff was a good pilot but a poor instructor. This may be true, but having been furnished with inferior human material he has had a difficult task. It did not appear from the conversation that Ibn Saud had any understanding of the conditions which the maintenance of an air force and its personnel involves. 202. When passing through Egypt on his way to Saudi Arabia in September, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba put up another scheme, in conversation with the oriental secretary to His Majesty’s Embassy. He said he was going to ask for three British pilots and one engineer who would have complete control of the Saudi machines. After some discussion he urged that at least one British air officer should be sent to Jedda to see what could be done. Nothing came of these projects, but a scheme based on the suggestions which the Air Ministry had made in January was eventually put before the Saudi Minister in London, and accepted by his Government. The Air Ministry were prepared, as a first step, to receive up to a dozen suitably selected young men to undergo a preliminary course of twelve months’ training in motor and aircraft mechanical work in the Mechanical 1 ransport Repair Section of the Royal Air Force depot at Aboukir in Egypt. They would forgo in the case of Saudi candidates the normal charge of' £1 a day required of foreign students, though the Saudis would have to provide their own accommodation and living expenses. The provision of advanced training for pupils who showed promise in this first stage would be considered later. In addition it might be possible to arrange for a small number of suitable candidates (not more than six at a time) to undergo a course of training as pilots at the civil Hying school run by Misr-Airwork in Cairo, though in this53 case the cost of training, as well as of accommodation and maintenance, would fall on the Saudi Government. The Saudi Government, when accepting with gratitude 'f.e offer of help, asked to be informed of the standard of education requned of the candidates to be sent to Egypt, so that they might not send men of the wrong type. At the end of the year a proposal was being made to the ^' 5ai1 ^ 1 Government that the details requiring to be settled should be dealt with by the Saudi Legation in Cairo. 203. At one moment Sheikh Hafiz Wahba informed the foreign Office that if Ibn Saud could not get a small air mission from His Majesty’s Govern ment he might apply to Soviet Russia : the King realised the advantages that would result if he obtained assistance from some country like Holland or a Scandinavian country, which had no political interest in the Middle East but a Soviet mission would cost much less. It was thought at first that the King had “White” Russians in mind, but Sheikh Hafiz Wahba asseverated that it was a Soviet mission that was in question, and that an offer had been made by the Soviet Embassy in Paris when the Amir Saud was there. It seems, howevei, that Sheikh Hafiz was under a misapprehension. Fuad Bey assured His Majesty s Minister that there was no question of accepting a Soviet mission, and that Sheikh Hafiz must have been under a misapprehension. 204. In the course of a conversation in December Ibn Saud said that he wished very much to get rid of the Italians, but realised that to replace them by British or French might be awkward. Replacement by Moslems however, would not be open to the same objection, and he therefore wished to know whether His Majesty’s Government could recommend a suitable Moslem from Egypt or Iraq. After some discussion it was found that what the King had in mind was a sort of chief of staff to advise on all arms or, failing that, a trained man to take charge of aviation. The intention apparently was to ma-^e direct application for the loan of the services of a suitable person if His Majesty s Government would first advise the Saudi Government as to the character and capacity of possible candidates. Sir R. Bullard was not sure that the scheme offered great hopes from the technical point of view, but since it had been necessary to blow cold upon the larger aviation schemes of the Saudi Government, he recommended the proposal to His Majesty’s Government as a means of eliminating the Italians and pleasing Ibn Saud. No reply had been received by the end of the year. Other Aviation. 205 For the first time a regular air service was operated in Saudi Arabia between Jedda and Medina for the 1937 pilgrimage season The venture, which was run by Misr Airlines, is to be repeated for the 1938 pilgrimage. A few pilgrims also travelled by air from and to Cairo. 206. Apart from this seasonal enterprise there is no civil aviation in this country. Permission is rarely given to non-Moslem aviators to land at Jedda (an exception of this rule was made in June to enable two Royal Air lorce aircraft to bring down from Egypt advance copies ot the report of the Royal Commission on Palestine for delivery to the King) and even Moslems are forbidden to fly over or in the immediate neighbourhood of Mecca. 207 Early in the year a set of regulations was issued governing the landing ,&gt;f fnreip-n aircraft in Saudi territory. These were not noteworthy, except that complfance whh the regulations does not absolve the intending visitor from having to obtain permission beforehand to enter Saudi Arabia by an. VI.— Press. 208 The two Mecca weeklies, the Umm-al-Qura and tYvz Saut-al-Hejaz, + • nod in bp the onlv newspapers of importance m this country, though the continued ^ b f aHlunawwara, a paper published in Medina, saw the wtripril infa Znthiy magazine, enti'tle’d AUdaa-al-Islami, and printed In decided to sent six persons to Egypt to learn printing. Whether this decision was acted on is noUmown, [17650]54 but it must in all fairness be stated that the printing of the Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-al-Hejaz compares favourably with that of many more sophisticated Arabic newspapers. 209. Very little local news of interest appears in the press, and nothing tending to criticise the existing state of affairs. Comment on foreign affairs also is restrained by the hand of authority, and although both newspapers at times published material directed against the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government, the tone was very mild. VII.— Legislation. 210. The “ Corps legislatif ” of Saudi Arabia, the nature of which is doubtful, was not active during 1937, and, apart from a Workmen’s Compensa tion Act promulgated in December (paragraph 73), the only enactments of importance were decrees regulating the operations of the National Arab Car Transport Company and the Arab Export Company, which can more conveniently be dealt with in the economic report. VIII.— Education. 211. There has been little educational activity during the year under review. The Egyptian Ministry of Education nominated a member of their teaching staff as a master for the Najah School at Medina, and it was announced in January that boarding and preparatory departments were to be established in the special school which prepares students for study abroad. After some delays this school opened its doors on the 20th March. Its students are said to number forty-eight. In April the local press announced the opening school at Abha, in the wilds of Najran. IX.— Public Health. 212. General health conditions in Saudi Arabia remained very much as they were in 1936. Some advance can be said to have been made, but more theoretical than practical. 213. The new hospital at Taif, reported last year to be under construction, was finished and opened in September. A “ medical centre ” is reported to have been opened at Hail to enable a medical control over the pilgrim route from Nejef to be imposed. The Mecca hospital, which was visited by the Indian medical officer of the Legation, appears to be fairly well organised, and it now possesses a radiologist who is said to be competent. Bacteriological laboratories for clinical work, not research, have been set up at Mecca and Jedda, though little is heard about the work of the one in Jedda. The announcement that a school for nurses (male) has been opened in Mecca is regarded with some scepticism as to its results. Dr. Mackie (paragraph 165 of 1936), in co-operation with a distinguished medical colleague, presented a confidential report to the Saudi Government conveying in the most diplomatic language various suggestions for the improvement of the health service. It is probably in response to one of these suggestions that two, or perhaps more, travelling doctors have been engaged to visit some of the less accessible parts of the kingdom. The latest development in the health services is revealed in a notice which appears in the press to the effect that photo-therapeutical treatment is given (perhaps free) at stated times. What is not known is the precise degree of skill and training possessed by the doctors in charge of these various activities. Many of them are Syrians with inferior degrees from Damascus, and it is not believed that they are as a whole of a very high character. An attempt to improve their technical qualifications has been made by the despatch of several of them to specialise in various branches of medicine in Europe. 214. Some interest has been shown in international health matters. The Director-General of the Public Health Department, Dr. Mahmud Hamouda, attended the International Health Congress at Paris as official Saudi delegate, and the Saudi Arabian Government were also officially represented at the International Trachoma Congress at Cairo.55 215. During his visit to Paris Dr. Hamouda expressed himself to the International Health Officer in fulsome terms about health conditions m baudi Arabia, but without carrying conviction to his hearers. 216 In Jedda, at any rate, some effort has been made to raise the standard of municipal hygiene. The school children and the soldiers were vaccinated early in the year while the town crier shouted a warning against foot-and-mouth disease. Rubbish boxes have been put up and scavenging carts go round to empty such of them as have not been emptied already by the goats, cats and dogs. Periodical warnings are now issued in the press against the practice of displaying food-stuff in shops without protection against dirt and flies. 217 Earlv in the year much was heard of an Italian proposal to build a hospital in Jedda. But the Saudi Arabian Government did not ag^ee and m the end P the Italian dispensary similar to those already existing in the British and Soviet Legations in Jedda was reopened m a larger building m the charge of a single Italian doctor. Other foreign medical missions were the Egyptian, Dutch (Javanese) and Afghan, all in Mecca. The Egyptian takya m Mecca is m the charge of a doctor who engages in medical as well as general charitable work. 218 In September Dr. E. D. Pridie, Director, Sudan Medical Services visited Jedda on his way to the Sudan. He discussed matters connected with the medical aspect of the Sudan pilgrimage with the Legation and raised the questm of sending a Sudanese medical mission for the pilgrimage season. The proposal was under consideration at the end of the year. X.— Pilgrimage. 219 The annual pilgrimage report, forwarded to the Foreign Office on the 9th August, gives full information of the 1937 pilgrimage. It is only necessary then to°make a short reference to it here. 220 Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhu 1 Hijjah fell on Saturday, the 20th February Some 80,000 pilgrims were estimated to have been P^ent at • \rafat of whom 49,957 were from overseas, as against 32,423 last year. Intensified Saudi propaganda, and better economic conditions, especially m the East Indies were themain causes of this-to Saudi Arabia-welcome increase. The increase was most notable in pilgrims from Egypt, Malaya and West Africa, but M Mussolini and General Franco contributed by their efforts, recorded else where,' to earn merit by subsidising the Moslem pilgrimage. The only decrease was in the number of pilgrims from Palestine. 221. The general health of the pilgrims, which was favoured by the good weather, was again good. 222. Approximate figures for arrivals of pilgrims in the Hejaz by sea are as follows: — British and British Administrated- Indian Malayan ... West African Sudanese ... Palestinian Dutch East Indian Egyptian Others ... 1936. 8,439 906 2,550 1,196 769 4,540 5,724 8,299 32,423 1937. 10,588 2,524 4,787 1,658 428 6,857 10,226 12,889 49,957 223. 1,185 pilgrims travelled overland to Mecca from Iraq, and for the most part returned home the same way. 224. Destitute pilgrims, mainly from India, showed a decrease from 662 in 1936 to 234. 925 The bringing of the Mahmal is dealt with in paragraph 164 and the air service maintained during the return season between Jedda and Medina in paragraph 204.56 226. Among the notable persons who made the pilgrimage in 1937 the more important were their Highnesses the Khan and Begum of Kalat, his Highness the Emir of Kano, Seyyid Amin-el-Husseini (the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) and three of the sons of His Majesty the King of the Yemen. 227. Transport arrangements showed some improvement in the shape of mere and slightly better vehicles, but the roads remained in a very bad state. 228. The cost of the pilgrimage remained at about the same level as in 1936, the 25 per cent, decrease in the transport charges being offset by the employment of a more expensive type of vehicle and by increases in certain other items. Estates of deceased pilgrims are in future to contribute 50 piastres towards the expenses of burial. 229. Certain difficulties which were encountered by the Legation in dealing with pilgrims are mentioned in paragraph 124. XI. —Slavery. 230. The British right to manumit slaves who might take refuge in the Legation having been renounced in October 1936, the Legation has had little to do with the question of slaves during 1937 except to keep a watch for any signs of activity on the part of the Saudi Arabian Government in applying the Slavery (£ Instructions ” which they promulgated on the 2nd October, 1936. 231. In May a notice was published in the press reminding slave owners that they were required by the “ Instructions ” to register their slaves within a year, and that any slave not so registered might “ present himself before the competent authority and .... demand to be given a certificate of freedom.” 232. At the end of this year’s grace, in October 1937, such enquiries as the Legation had been able to make showed that while a number of slaves might have been registered, the majority had not. In fact, it would hardly be unjust to consider the regulations a dead letter. XII.— Naval Matters. 233. The following visits were paid to Jedda by the escort vessels of His Majesty s navy during the year :— H.M.S. Londonderry: February 19-25; July 15-20; November 7-12. H.M.S. Weston: April 20-22. flotilla leader Pantera visited Jedda from the 21st October 1 rpi 26th October. This was the first visit of an Italian warship since July fuoo.L r French sloo P D Iberville visited Jedda from the 26th January until the 28th January. J 23o. In September Captain W. K. D. Dowding, D.S.C., succeeded Captain . B. Jacomb, as senior naval officer, Bed Sea, in H.M.S. Londonderry. i , 236 - Xi slt f. Jed f a continued to be made by His Majesty’s escort vessels by b ar e notification to the Saudi Arabian Government without any request for permission. No other Saudi ports were visited. 4 237 Captain Dowding during the November visit of H.M.S Londonderry discussed the question of lights and buoys in Jedda harbour informally with the Legation. There are at present no lights and few buoys. It was agreed that the SvndffiflWK b V“ gat ? d ’ SinCe {t W , aS known that the Saudi Arabian Mining newlv hin 1 fn Pr A Tt IT &amp; S 5 “ te ( I , ested ln connexion with the approach to their newly-built pier At the end of the year, too, the Banque Misr Wan to show some signs of interest in the improvement of Jedda Harbour, and it if understood .t innttiSS S, ”«f ‘ l “ Ch “ l '° r ”“' 157 XIII. —Miscellaneous. 238. M. Rom Landau, the Polish author of God is my Adventure, came to Jed da in March at the invitation of the Saudi Arabian Minister in London. He had been commissioned-by his publishers to write “ a comprehensive survey of the spiritual undercurrents influencing the cultural, political and religious life m Europe and the Near East.” Ihn Saud gratified M. Landau’s wish for an audience, and came to Shumaisi to meet him. The interview seems to have made a deep impression on M. Landau. 239 The mediaeval condition of this country is shown by a trial for witch craft which took place at Riyadh in 1937. The accused, who was sentenced by the Sharia Court for killing a boy by witchcraft, received 300 lashes in the public market before an interested audience, which included Fuad Bey Hamza. 240. The under-mentioned books, which were noted in 1937, have some connexion, though not always a close one, with the Arabian Peninsula or its people a— Orientations, by Sir Ronald Storrs. T. E. Lawrence, by some of his friends. Triumphant Pilgrimage, by Owen Rutter. (Untruthful.) The Arabs, by Bertram Thomas. The History of the Arabs, by Hitti. 241. An unpleasant form of literary activity was indulged in.by Colonel P. T. Etherton, who, on his return to England after an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a mining concession from the Saudi Government, published in a cheap illustrated weekly an article both untruthful and also exceedingly offensive to the Saudi Government and to Ibn Saud. 242. The Legation were surprised to learn that a film of the pilgrimage in Mecca, which could only have been taken with Ibn Saud's consent, was being shown in the Sudan. It is believed, however, that the King is not opposed in principle to educational films, though he has not yet reached the point of authorising such films to be shown in Saudi Arabia.SAUDI ARABIA. /7 Annual Report, 1936. [~E 1637/1637/2S] Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received March 22.) (No. 31.) Sir, Jedda, February 28, 1937. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the annual report on Saudi Arabia for the year 1936. As I did not arrive until the middle of September,. and as little of importance happened between that date and the end of the year, the report is based almost entirely on the work of Sir Andrew Ryan, who left in June, and that of Mr. Calvert, who was in charge from that time until my arrival. Mr. Calvert also wrote the sections on the pilgrimage, public health and the ' Government of India dispensaries, and made many valuable suggestions about other parts of the reports.

IN contrast to the Italo-Ethiopian War and the troubles in Palestine, both of which interested Saudi Arabia closely, there was peace throughout the Saudi dominions. Political refugees continued to return, and except for the natural jealousy of the Hejazi for the Nejdi, there were no serious signs of lack of unity. The gradual weakening of Wahabi fanaticism is removing one great cause of internal friction. 2. It was a wonderful year for Ibn Saud in political affairs. He concluded important treaties with Iraq and Egypt, effected an exchange of notes with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, which gave him great satisfaction, and was perhaps the most important figure in the intervention of the Arab rulers in the Palestine question. Towards the end of the year, however, two shadows fell over the sunny landscape—the change of Government in Iraq and the Alexandretta question—which probably made Ibn Saud realise that pan-Arab politics are more difficult than they had appeared. 3. Economically, the year must be considered disappointing, for neither the mines nor the oil wells which were being examined or exploited held out any certain hope of success. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company did not find oil m commercial quantities, and although the Saudi Arabian Muning Syndicate found plenty of gold, they did not find enough water to work it within economic distance of the mine. A second oil concession, granted during the year was still in the prospecting stage at the end of December. . . 4 - Saudi Government show at times that touchiness at anything that looks like foreign interference that is to be expected in these days from oriental countries recently risen to independence. It sometimes takes an extreme form as for instance, where Sheikh Yusuf Yasin argues that the Government of India ought to admit into India any Saudi pilgrim agent who is considered by his own Government to be fit for this work, or describes as a relic of the Capitulations the interest which His Majesty’s Legation take in British pilgrims while they are in baud! Arabia. There are signs that the privileges which have hitherto been enjoyed by the foreign missions, particularly in the matter of exemption from customs dues are being examined by the Saudi authorities and that attempts will be made to cut them down. The privileges are wider than in most other countries and they have been grossly abused by one or two of the Legations. On the other hand, the Legations suffered from various restrictions such as do not obtain in any other country and they are morally entitled to some unusual privileges bv way of compensation. F uy IT—'-Foreign Relations. (A) With States in Arabia. Ambassador ^'ifagdad'a^raftY^ity^which 1 fSty^arraiTted^he^’ant^^ 6 ? comment m last vear’s renort thni L a * TTS wailant;e d the anticipat&lt; Of other States, ^and YgC dtGl h/^S^^[15154] b 2 3 neighbouring countries in which Great Britain and France have special interests.” Article 6, for instance, read thus :— “ The high contracting parties undertake to co-ordinate their objects in regard to the peoples of neighbouring Arab countries, and to exert peaceful efforts to help these peoples towards the realisation of their aspirations for independence.” This would have provided for interference in both Palestine and Syria, and the next article aimed at similar interference in the ‘ c Arab principalities in the Arabian Peninsula.” Article 4 contained the far-reaching provision that if one of the two parties should be the object of an act of aggression on the part of a third State in spite of efforts made under article 3 to settle the dispute by peaceful means, the other party should “ forthwith join efforts with the former for the repulsion of such aggression.” The draft, moreover, contained certain other defects which were probably due to hurried or careless drafting. 6. There seems to be little doubt that the initiative in the matter had come from Ibn Saud, and that Italian aggression against Ethiopia, added to his permanent suspicion of Turkey, had made him anxious to push it through. Information given by Yasin Pasha to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in February makes it possible to follow the course of the negotations from the Iraqi point of view. According to this statement Sheikh Yusuf Yasin pressed hard for the inclusion of an article on the lines of the draft of article 4 quoted above. He was impatient of the complications of the League of Nations, and wanted something which would bind Iraq to hasten to the help of Saudi Arabia whenever she claimed that she was the victim of an act of aggression. Italy’s descent on Abyssinia had evidently alarmed King Abdul Aziz, who wished to be sure of a friend in need. Yasin Pasha, on the other hand, was frankly disdainful of Iraq’s backward and barbarous neighbour. He seems to have told Sheikh Yusuf Yasin plainly that Iraq could not hope for material help from Saudi Arabia until the country was modernised and administered in a civilised manner. For Iraq, therefore, the treaty was little more than a gesture of sympathy between two Arab nations; the greater share of the practical benefits would accrue to Saudi Arabia. Moreover, the Iraqi Government could not take on any undertakings which conflicted with her obligations as a member of the League of Nations. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had pointed out that there might be difficulties about slavery and missionary enterprise if the treaty committed his Government too far to observance of the spirit of the Covenant, and Yasin Pasha therefore agreed to omit a reference to the underlying principles of the League which had been inserted in the draft and to substitute a more limited undertaking to carry out the provisions of article 17 of the Covenant. 7. The Iraq Government consulted His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom throughout the negotiations, through His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad. His Majesty’s Government, while disclaiming any wish to oppose the strengthening of friendly relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, the establishment of which they had done so much in the past to encourage and facilitate, made it clear to the Iraq Government that they took the strongest exception to articles 6 and 7, and that they considered the Iraq Government would be well advised, before agreeing to the remaining provisions, to take the views of His Majesty’s Government into consideration. This advice was followed; articles 6 and 7 disappeared from the treaty and many other defects were remedied. The treaty ceased to be the pan-Arab document which had been aimed at originally, though it could still be described with some reason by both parties as a great step towards the union of all Arabs. 8. The ‘ c Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance ” was signed at Bagdad on the 2nd April, and the text was made public in Mecca and Bagdad on the 6th April and was communicated the same day by the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the foreign missions in Jedda. The following are the main heads of what was agreed upon :— (1) Neither party to enter into any commitment towards a third Power which might prejudice the interests of the other. (2) All disputes to be settled by friendly negotiation, or, failing this, under the new arbitration protocol to be negotiated in due course.(3) Joint efforts to be made to settle peacefully any dispute between either party and any third party involving danger of war. (4) Joint efforts to be made to repel any aggression against either party. Definition of aggression. (5) Stated measures to be taken by each party in the event of disorder in the territory of the other. (6) Efforts to be made to secure the accession of the Yemen to the treaty. More general provision for the possible accession of any other independent Arab State, at the request of such State. (7) Exchange of educational and military missions. (8) Each party to be free, but not bound, to request the other to undertake its diplomatic and consular representation abroad. (9) Caveat in favour of Iraqi obligations under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. Both parties to carry out the provisions of article 17 of the Covenant and to observe the principles of the Kellogg Pact of 1928. (10) Either party to be free to denounce the treaty without notice in the event of aggression by the other against a third party. Friendship not to be impaired by such denunciation. (11) Preservation of previous treaties between the two parties where they do not conflict with the present treaty. (12) Negotiation of subsidiary agreements on stated subjects to be begun within one year. (13) , (14) Treaty to come into force on exchange of ratifications and to remain in force for ten years, and a further similar period failing notice of termination one year before the expiration of the first period. 9. The definition of aggression in article 4 is modelled on that in the Turco-Iraqi-Iranian Pact of Non-Aggression, which had been initialled at Geneva in the autumn of 1935 (see paragraph 109 below). Special interest attaches to the references to the Covenant of the League of Nations in the definition of aggression and in article 9. The object of article 6, to secure the adhesion of the Yemen, had npt been attained by the end of the year. This point is dealt with more fully in the Yemen section of this report. On the same day on which the treaty was signed notes were exchanged between the Iraqi Foreign Minister and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to make it clear that the term ££ understanding and agreement with a third State ” in article 1 did not cover economic and financial affairs. 10. During the treaty negotiations discussions on various subjects took place between Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and the Iraqi Government. The following summary, based on information supplied to His Majesty’s Embassy at Bagdad by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, shows the subjects discussed, and what appears to have happened in regard to each :— (1) The Demarcation of the Frontier between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was dropped. It was suggested to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that, as the questions that had arisen concerned a number of places through which the Uqair line passed, some attempt should be made to decide which tribes are entitled to use individual wells in any given area. The centres in question are generally situated at the points where salients occur on the frontier. They are by no means well defined, and comprise a number of wells covering an area of 4 or 5 square miles. Access to these wells is of great importance to the nomad tribes, and the Iraqi Government suggested that they should be partitioned on the basis of established tribal rights. They were willing that King Abdul Aziz should, in the first place, decide to what tribe or tribes individual wells belong. The Iraqi Government were fairly confident that most of the wells would be found to belong to Iraqi tribes. (2) The Division of the Neutral Zone. Nuri Pasha indicated in a letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that it was impossible to divide up the neutral zone, as many of the wells south of a line drawn across the centre belong traditionally to Iraqi tribes, principally the Dhafir. He suggested that, in order to maintain order in the zone, a mixed Iraqi-Saudi administration should be set up to keep the peace.u 5 (3) Extradition. The Iraqi Government asked that better arrangements should be made for the working of the existing extradition agreement of April 1931. Since this agreement came into force the Iraqi Government had not addressed a single demand for extradition to the Saudi Government; the Saudi Government had made six. Of the nine persons involved in the Saudi demands, five had not been traced, one had been handed over, and the surrender of one had been refused for lack of evidence, and of two on the ground that the persons concerned were Iraqis. Any amendment of the agreement seemed, therefore, to be of little practical urgency. Nuri Pasha suggested, however, that, as most of the cases for which extradition was demanded were tribal, they should be dealt with, in accordance with the Tribal Civil and Criminal Disputes Regulations, by the Tribal Department of the Ministry of the Interior. (4) Residence. This was left for discussion in a year’s time. (5) The Dahamshah Tribe. This was allowed to drop. (6) The Reciprocal Exemption of the Subjects of each Country from Visas when entering the Country of the other. When Dr. Naji-al-Asil visited Riyadh in November subjects (1) and (2) were discussed again, and point (4) was settled. 11. The treaty which was greeted with such satisfaction within the Arab world was regarded with some suspicion by certain States outside it. The Iranian Minister in London made tentative enquiries about the treaty at the Foreign Office and received a reassuring reply. By command of King Abdul Aziz Sheikh Yusuf Yasin informed Sir Andrew Ryan that the Italian Minister in Jedda had shown some concern about the Saudi-Iraq Treaty and the Saudi-Lgyptian negotia tions, fearing, apparently, that His Majesty’s Government might be trying to promote a combine of Arab Powers with hostile intent towards Italy. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that in reply he had informed M. Persico that the action recently taken to bring the Arab Powers closer together was in no way inspired by His Majesty’s Government. It had been taken entirely for Arab purposes, the only object being the safeguarding of Arab interests. His Majesty’s Government might have been given information, but they had not been concerned in the matter. In commenting to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on this statement Sir Andrew Ryan said that it had been thought in some quarters that the alliance was directed against Great Britain and/or France, but His Majesty’s Government had too much confidence in the good sense and friendship of Saudi Arabia and Iraq to pay attention to such suggestions. Sir Andrew Ryan also told Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the gist of the instructions given to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad regarding the original draft proposals for the treaty. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that in conversation with M. Persico he had referred to the idea that the alliance might be directed against Great Britain or more particularly against France. He had given assurances to M. Persico that the alliance was in no way directed against Italy. He had also assured the French representative in Bagdad that the alliance was not directed against France, and Fuad Bey had given similar assurances to the French Minister in Jedda. Sir Andrew Ryan made a personal suggestion that in any further statement that might issue from Saudi sources there should be a reference to the suggestions that outside influences had been at work and a clear declaration that no foreign Power or Powers had had any hand in bringing about the treaty. It is reasonable to suppose that it was this suggestion which prompted a leading article which appeared in the Umm-al-Qura in June, entitled, c ‘ Concerning the Iraqi-Saudi Arab Alliance.” The writer referred to the idle speculations of certain Italian and French and even Arab journalists, who interpreted the alliance as having been brought about by His Majesty's Government as a means of combating certain other Powers, and to certain British commentators, who, on the other hand, considered that the object of the alliance was to unite to drive Europeans from every Arab country, and that it was directed against British policy. The alliance, the writer continued, was neither inspired by'nor aimed at any foreign country. Its sole object was the interest of the two [15154] B 36 parties to it, and their defence. It was open to the participation of any Arab country, but was inspired by friendship for all friendly countries. 12. The Treaty of Alliance is the final proof of an extraordinary change which has come over the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in the space of a few years. What Fuad Bey described on one occasion as the almost hopeless state of affairs of 1929 was followed by a rapprochement in 1930 and a treaty in 1931, and the Treaty of Alliance has crowned the whole. Fuad Bey remarked to Sir Andrew Ryan that the death of King Feisal had made a great difference, as it had stimulated Saudi Arabia’s sense of responsibility for Iraq. 13. If Saudi Arabia ever felt entitled to patronise Iraq her feelings may have received a shock from the change of government in Iraq, which resulted from the military cowp of the 29th October. Ibn Saud sent to his Minister in London a telegram of misgiving, which appears, however, to have been despatched several days before he received the visit of Dr. Naji-al-Asil, the new Iraqi Foreign Minister, at Riyadh. It had been intended that Nuri Pasha should go to Riyadh for the ratification of the treaty, and one of the first acts of the new Iiaqi Government was to decide—apparently in order to reassure Ibn Saud as to their goodwill—that Nuri Pasha’s successor should go to Riyadh at once in his plane The treaty was ratified, the questions of the demarcation of the frontier and the abolition of the neutral zone were discussed, and an etablissement agree- ment was signed. During the visit Dr. Naji transmitted to Ibn Saud on behalf u Ghazi the insignia of the Hashimite order, which is bestowed only on the heads of States. It was noticed at Koweit that, whereas Dr Naii-al-Asil went to Riyadh wearing the Iraqi dress, consisting of a suit and a “ sidara ” cap, he returned wearing Arab head-dress and cloak. He told the Political Agent that Ibn Saud had made some remark about foreign diplomats wearing Arab c othes in Cential Arabia, and that he had excused himself on the ground of ha^te m departure. -d i P ar ^ pl a y e d by Saudi Arabia and Iraq in connexion with the Palestine disorders is dealt with in the section on Palestine. Twice it appeared to Ibn Saud, and with some reason, that Iraq was trying to take the lead The first occasion was when Nuri Pasha paid his slightly ambiguous and whollv unsuccessful visit to Jerusalem to see the Arab leaders. The second was when m the course of his visit to Riyadh Dr. Naji-al-Asil proposed to Ibn Saud that all discussion on the I alestine question and all correspondence with His Maiestv’s (jovernment or with other authorities on behalf of the Palestine Arabs should be undertaken exclusively by the Iraq Government on behalf of all the Arab rulers This extraordinary proposal, which in any case could not have been accepted by His Majesty s Government, was promptly rejected by Ibn Saud. . 15 ' In , vlr , tu ? ? f , the al 5 nest y offered by Ibn Saud in 1935, most of the Saudi telm« T)7 h0 had k !f at 6 ^? 6 “^returned to Saudi Arabia on favourable terms. There remained ^aif-bin-Humaid, paramount sheikh of the Ataiba and some of his clansmen. He received an invitation from Ibn Saud and was inclined to accept, but it appears that at the end of the year he had decided to stav on m Iraq because, after the Bagdad coup d'fctat, the King of Iraq increased the monthly allowances to the Nejdi and Hejaz refugees, which had gradually been cut down since the death of King Feisal. g u y oeen 16. It remains only to mention a few points of minor imnortance An agreement about telegraph rates and settlement of accounts which had been concluded between the telegraph departments of Saudi Arabia and Iraq on the 6th November 1935, was not published in Saudi Arabia, and only became known to His Majesty s Legation in April 1936, when a translation was received from His Majesty s Lmbassy at Bagdad. A modern note was introduced into the Saudi celebrations of the post-Ramadhan feast when it was announced that telegrams of congratulations from Saudi Arabia to Iraq would be ac “pted a£ one-third the usual rate. According to the Iraq Royal Air Force Summary for September, the Saudi officials at the four newly-created posts of Wakiya Umm Rakhuma, Lina and Hafr-al-Batm had begun to collect customs dues at 200 fiR on every camel-load of goods imported from Iraq into Nejd, and this measure had been received with dissatisfaction by the Nejdi tribes, who were accustomed5r&gt; [15154] b 4 7 to get their supplies from Iraq. Nothing more was heard about this during the year. An overland route by car between Najaf and Medina, for pilgrims, was established in January. (2) Palestine. 17. On the 29th April, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, acting on instructions from the King, spoke to Sir Andrew Ryan privately about the Palestine situation. The King had received a telegram from Haji Amin Husaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, declaring that ‘ c Arab Palestine ’ ’ had been upset by the British Zionist policy, which was calculated to destroy the Arab nation. All parties had decided upon a strike, which would continue until that policy was changed for one which would ensure the safety of the Arabs, and Ibn Saud was asked to help to save the “ sacred country ” and to enable it to realise its aims. The King had sent no reply. He wanted Sir Andrew Ryan’s advice. That advice, given personally and on the spur of the moment, was that the King would neither promote his friendship with Great Britain nor enhance his prestige in the Arab world by concerning himself with Palestine affairs. In reporting this conversa tion to the Foreign Office, Sir Andrew Ryan said : “I am afraid that, despite all professions of his desire to avoid anything that might indispose His Majesty’s Government, Ibn Saud would dearly like to feel that his influence counted for something in Palestine, both for general political reasons and because of the religious appeal which Jerusalem, the ‘ First Qibla of Islam,’ makes to Moslem sentiment.” The truth of this was borne out by Ibn Saud’s subsequent conduct, which was an attempt to reconcile these two aims. The Foreign Office approved the attitude of Sir Andrew Ryan, and provided him with certain arguments to be used at his discretion if the subject should be raised again in Jedda. In fact, it never was raised again in Jedda. Ibn Saud took it up later in London, through the Saudi Legation. 18. On the 23rd June the Saudi Minister in London, who had already explained to the Foreign Office Ibn Saud’s anxiety about the situation in Palestine and the difficult position in which he found himself between his friendship for His Majesty’s Government and the requests from his own people and from Arabs elsewhere, that he should support the Arab cause in Palestine, communicated to the Foreign Office orally an offer by Ibn Saud to take the initiative in concerting action with the Kings of Iraq and the Yemen to urge on the Palestinian Arabs in their own interests to abandon the disturbances. This action would be based on recent assurances by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the grievances of the Arabs would be thoroughly examined by an impartial and authoritative Royal Commission as soon as the disorders had ceased. On the 4th July the Saudi Minister was informed that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom appreciated Ibn Saud’s offer and gladly accepted it. A few days later, in reply to a suggestion that Ibn Saud should also approach the rulers of Egypt and Transjordan, the Saudi Minister was informed that His Majesty’s Government agreed to the participation of the Amir of Transjordan, but would prefer that no approach should be made to Egypt. It is not necessary to follow in detail the negotiations which ensued. They took three months, for it was on the 10th October that the appeal was issued. There were several causes of delay. The Iraqi Foreign Minister paid a visit to Palestine, which, however well-intentioned, only served to arouse unjustified hopes among the Arabs and to annoy Ibn Saud, who felt that Nuri Pasha was trying to get all the credit for any settlement that might be reached. This resentment was natural, since the idea for the joint intervention was Ibn Saud’s, yet he had not attempted to assume the leadership. Nuri’s action was embarrassing to His Majesty’s Government later when Ibn Saud wanted to send Fuad Bey to Palestine to talk to the Arab leaders, and they were obliged to refuse the offer on the ground that it might arouse false hopes. Another cause of delay was the desire of the Arab Higher Committee, the directing body of the strike, to secure some sort of promise that if they called off the strike and the disorders in accordance with the appeal His Majesty’s Government would make some concession to their demands, e.g., by stopping immigration until the Royal Commission, which had now been appointed, had issued its report, and by granting a general amnesty. The Iraq Government and Ibn Saud both wished to have at least some private assurance that some concession would be made if the disorders ceased, but His Majesty’s'•mm 8 Government asked for the unconditional cessation of disorder, and eventually this was accepted. Identical and simultaneous appeals were issued on the 10th October by Ibn Saud, the Kings of Iraq and the Yemen, and the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan. The Egyptian Prime Minister decided that it would be better for the King of Egypt not to take part in the joint action. The appeal, which had been approved by His Majesty’s Government, was as follows :— &gt;£ To our sons the Arabs of Palestine! We have been much distressed by the present situation in Palestine, and in agreement with our brother Kings and the Amir, we appeal to you to restore tranquillity in order to prevent further bloodshed, relying on the good intentions of the British Government and their declared 'desire to see that justice is done. Be assured that we shall continue our endeavours to help you.” The insertion of the last sentence had been agreed to by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the understanding that any representations made by the Arab rulers on behalf of the Palestine Arabs must be made through the ordinary diplomatic channels. A little later, in reply to an enquiry on this point which had been made by the Saudi Legation in London, Sir Lancelot Oliphant informed the Saudi Minister in writing that any representation which King Abdul Aziz might wish to make regarding the situation in Palestine, whether before the arrival of the Royal Commission in Palestine or after, and whether through his Minister in London or through His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda, would be most carefully considered by His Majesty’s Government. This reply was sent when Ibn Saud, acting on the advice of His Majesty’s Government, which, however, was in accordance with his own inclination, had refused an invitation from the Govern ment of Bagdad to send a delegation to Bagdad, with a view to the adoption of a common policy towards His Majesty’s Government over the Palestine question. 19. The Arab Higher Committee seized the opportunity offered by the appeal of the Arab rulers to extricate themselves from a difficult position, and called off the strike and the disorders. A few days later the Saudi Minister in London, acting on urgent instructions from Ibn Saud, expressed to Mr. Rendel the earnest hope that, if and when peaceful conditions should be completely re-established in Palestine and the bands had dispersed, His Majesty’s Govern ment would consider the issue of an amnesty in favour of Arabs who had been imprisoned or interned in connexion with the recent disturbances. Mr. Rendel pointed out how necessary it was that nothing should be done which might give the impression that there had been an understanding on this subject before the calling off of the strike and the campaign of violence, but said that he would pass the message on to the proper quarters. It was decided soon afterwards, on general grounds, to release the political internees in Palestine, but to try persons awaiting trial where the evidence was sufficient, a decision for which Ibn Saud sent his thanks to His Majesty’s Government. 19a. Ibn Saud again took the initiative in a move which helped to induce the Arab Higher Committee to withdraw the decision to boycott the Royal Commission, which they had taken when they found that the immigration of Jews was not to be completely stopped pending the publication of the commission’s report. When the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs returned from the visit to Riyadh which he paid in November he informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad that the general attitude of Ibn Saud towards Palestine was that the Arab rulers should make no representations without reaching a common accord and obtaining the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government, and that Ibn Saud deplored the decision of the Arab Committee to boycott the Royal Commission, and had suggested that the rulers should jointly urge them to change their attitude, provided that His Majesty’s Government agreed beforehand, and that Haji Amin Husaini gave an undertaking that the reply from the committee would be favourable. The appeal which resulted from this initiative found the Arab Higher Committee already half-repentant of their decision, and they sent off a small delegation to Bagdad and Riyadh which brought back from both capitals the advice to co-operate with the Royal Commission. This advice was acted upon, though not until January 1937. 20. There was little sign in Jedda that the population of the Hejaz felt very deeply for their Moslem brethren in Palestine. The population of the Hejaz towns is connected with non-Arab countries by ties of blood to such an extent9 [15154] b 5 that pan-Arab feeling must necessarily be diluted, and religious feeling is directed rather towards the great agglomerations of Moslems in India and the Aetherlan s East Indies which provide the bulk of the pilgrims to Mecca. In his first approach to the Foreign Office on the subject of Palestine the Saudi Minister in London claimed that Ibn Saud had prohibited demonstrations in the Hejaz which might have been interpreted as hostile to His Majesty’s Government. Nothing was heard by the Legation of any desire of the Hejazis to demonstrate, but it w ouio doubtless have been tempting for the Syrian pan-Arabs, who are employed by Ibn Saud to organise a show of feeling, and Ibn Saud may well have said that no such demonstration should be made. It is known from the reports ox the Omcer Commanding Desert Patrol in Transjordan that the tribes and towns ol northern Hejaz were taking intense interest in the Palestine question, and whether their interest was political or religious or racial or merely roused by the smell of loot, the fact is that the dangerous strategic advantage which they have over Irans- jordan was never used, and orders from Ibn Saud perhaps had as much to do with this as the remarkable state of tranquillity maintained by the Iransjordun authorities in their own territory. Ibn Saud also, if his assurance to His Majesty’s Government can be believed, ordered Faudhi Qawaqji to leave the territory of Saudi Arabia, where this firebrand had taken refuge on first lea\mg Palestine. The Mecca press was kept under close control. Until the strike and the disorders were called off it did not refer to them except to call for subscriptions for the Palestine “ victims ” and publish lists of subscribers. Eventually, a sum of £E. 500 was sent, and the collection of even this sum was said to have been difficult The list of subscribers included the names of a minor royalty and two or three of the leading officials. After the calling off of the strike the Mecca papers permitted themselves to show a little more sympathy towards the Arab movement, but very little in comparison with the articles which appeared in other Arab countries and probably the minimum that Ibn Saud felt it incumbent on him to show in order not to arouse the criticism of the “ Arab world.” (3) Transjordan. 21 This report follows last year’s precedent in dealing with the question of the lie of the Transjordan frontier, as a matter affecting Anglo-Saudi relations, in a later section (paragraph 63). There are no raids to be recorded, but com plaints and counter-complaints were not lacking. To a considerable extent these seem to have arisen out of the forward policy adopted by the Saudi Government in the attempt, it is believed, to find out from our protests of our failure to protest, whether particular places are admitted by His Majesty s Government to be in Saudi territory or not. A regrettable feature of the year was the number of written protests sent in bv the Saudi Arab Government about matters which could and ought to have been disposed of by direct communication between the frontier officials under the “Bon Voisinage ” Agreement of 1933. It is unnecessary to go into these protests in detail. Ihere were four of them. The first and most formidable was regarded by the Transjordan authorities as a means of defence against a complaint which the Officer Commanding Desert Patrol had made direct to the Saudi frontier authorities, while none of the three others was admitted by them to have any serious basis. Meanwhile, the monthly reports of Major Glubb had mentioned several cases of infringement by the Saudi authorities of the provisions against “enticement” in article 8 of the Had da Agreement, some of them the private efforts of frontier police who might hope to recover some arrears of pay from the taxes which would be levied on Transjordan tribes migrating into Saudi Arabia, but some much more serious. Towards the end of May His Majesty’s Minister was informed by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin that the Saudi Government had decided to place the whole of the frontier area from Jabal Aneza to the Gulf of Aqaba under the control of Abdul Aziz-bin- Zaid, who would have wide powers and would take over the frontier duties hitherto performed by the Governors of Kaf and Tebuk. As the relations between Ibn Zaid and Major Glubb had been good in the past, and as, moreover, there had been fewer incidents lately, Sir Andrew Evan recommended that the question of enticement should remain in abeyance until the effect of Ibn Zaid’s appointment could be seen, and that as to other complaints from our side he should use them in a general way in course of discussion of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier without going into detail except in the single case of certain incidents in the Rum-Aqaba10 area r which would form the subject of a personal letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. ihis was approved and acted upon, but the force of the personal letter was diminished by the length of time which had elapsed since the occurrence of the incidents complained of—a point the Saudi Government were not slow to seize. 22. The accusations of “ enticement ” (as defined in article 8 of the Hadda Agreement) were the subject of a full report from the Officer Commanding the Arab Legion which was received from the High Commissioner for Transjordan m October. report maintained, with details in support of the contention, that the Saudi authorities had infringed article 8 in two ways : (1) the Jauf authorities had repeatedly urged and invited Transjordan tribes to migrate into Saudi Arabia that year before the tribes had obtained the consent of their Government; (2) the Saudi Government had given salaries and gifts for the past two years to Auda-bin-ZaT Abu Taya and to the Demaniya section of the uwaitat, both of whom were considered by the Transjordan authorities to be re ugees from Transjordan. The report also asked whether it was notan infringe- wffi 6 K P1 7i lf ff n0t 0f ‘, he let , ter of the Hadda Agreement that the Saudi authoi ities should offer regular salaries to Transjordan tribes when in Saudi tr/fViof n 1 * suminer S razl . n £v induce them to remain there instead of returning to their homes in Transjordan, and named the Bani Sakhr and the Huwaitat as having been the subject of such offers from the Amir of Jauf.

The new Amir of Tebuk, for instance, brought only four men with him, instead of a complete personal guard, and recruited the rest of his 20 or 30 men locally. Again at the end of the year it was understood that the Saudi Government were proposing to build a series of forts facing those on the Transjordan side of the frontier, and to maintain communication between them by car patrols and wireless. The pairs of forts, if the Saudi scheme was carried out, would be these :— Transjordan. Aqaba Rum. Mudawwara. Bair. Azraq. Saudi Arabia. Haql. Alaqan. Dhat-al-Haj. Isawiya. Haditha. 25. Unnecessary friction is undoubtedly caused by doubt as to the side on which certain points near the frontier are situated. The much-disputed Hazim appeared in an oral protest made by the Saudi Government in December, while Tebuk, which had been the subject of discussion, was decided by His Majesty’s Government to be in Saudi Arabia. It is hoped that with Abdul Aziz-bin-Zaid as “ Inspector of the Western Frontiers of the Saudi Arab Kingdom ” the Saudi patrols will avoid the disputed points while the general frontier question is under consideration by higher authority. 26. In spite of the friction recorded in the preceding paragraphs, relations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia are so much better than they were a few years ago that it is necessary to remind the reader that the incidents, real or alleged, are relatively few and unimportant. It is satisfactory to record that in his last monthly report in 1936 the Officer Commanding Desert Patrol, while mentioning the difficulty of obtaining replies even from the new inspector, Abdul Aziz-bin-Zaid, and the regrettable custom the Saudis have of retrying cases which have been heard and decided in Transjordan, adds : “ These are, of course, minor matters and relations with Saudi Arabia are, on the whole, excellent.” 27. The Saudi Government eventually followed the example of the Trans jordan Government who had in 1935 exempted from the visa fee of 1 riyal any Saudi subjects entering Transjordan from Saudi Arabia for purposes of trade, and provided with certificates to that effect from specified Saudi officials. This does not mean that the Saudi Government will always imitate the greater liberality of the Transjordan authorities, who, for instance, make no objection to the entry of Saudi soldiers into Aqaba, or even to their going as far as Amman, for the purchase of provisions; but it is something. Early in the year increases in the Saudi customs dues on goods from Transjordan stopped that usually busy trade so effectually that, according to a report from Transjordan, whereas in 1935 hundreds of camels passed through Mudawwara every day for Saudi Arabia with food-stuffs and piece-goods, there was hardly one caravan in 1936 during a period of two months. Whether the object was to compel Saudi tribes to shop with Saudi merchants, and whether, as Transjordan suspected, the dues levied were not justified by the Saudi customs tariff, was never elucidated. The increases were eventually removed and trade was resumed. It seems that the Saudi tribes, who were accustomed to make their purchases in Transjordan, appealed to Ibn Saud against the increases, and that some of them were even considering whether they should not move into Transjordan to live. The increases had hit particularly hard some of the poorer members of the Beni Atiya, whose custom it is to work on the harvest in Kerak and to return to Saudi Arabia with their wages in kind, in the form of grain. As this grain would have been taxed at the new high rate, no Beni Atiya went to Kerak for the harvest. 28. The Saudi tribes on the Transjordan border watched the Palestine situation with the closest attention, and observers could see what a flood could be let loose on Transjordan if Ibn Saud gave the word. 29. When making to His Majesty’s Minister in October, in the name of Ibn Saud, a long statement on the' foreign relations of Saudi Arabia, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin implied that relations with Transjordan were made difficult by the incurable levity of the Amir Abdullah. Sheikh Yusuf may have been thinking in12 particular about certain personal letters addressed by the Amir to Ibn Saud earlier in the year, about which he had unofficially and confidentially consulted Sir Andrew iiyan. He stated that these letters suggested the dismissal of certain persons employed by the Saudi Government, declared the Saudi Real Property Law to be inconsistent with Islamic Law, and criticised the grant of a mining concession in the Medina region, the permission given to foreigners to go to Taif, and the alleged plan to make Taif a place of resort or residence for foreign diplomatic representatives. Sir Andrew Ryan deprecated the suggestion that Ibn Saud should reply in kind by criticisms of the administration of Transjordan. He reported the matter to the High Commissioner for Transjordan, with the suggestion that his Highness the Amir would be well advised to confine any private correspondence with Ibn Saud to exchanges of courtesy or at most to matters in which he had a direct personal interest, as in two cases known to Sir Andrew Ryan. The High Commissioner concurred in this view and issued instructions for a message in the proposed sense to be conveyed to his Highness, but before the instructions could be acted upon the disorders had broken out in Palestine and the instructions were held in abeyance until the time should be more propitious. The Saudi Government have another grievance against the Amir, to which they refer now and then, viz., a number of documents, which they regard, or pretend to regard, as proof that the Amir has intrigued against them. The documents are neither m the handwriting of the Amir nor signed with his seal, though the Saudis allege that they bear a cypher signature which he uses in secret corres pondence, and pieces which were read over to the chief secretary in Jerusalem appeared “ ambiguous and not particularly damning.” Sir Andrew Ryan had been told about these documents by the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, but had discouraged their production, and he gained the impression that the Saudi authorities liked to keep them up their sleeve and had no intention to make pubb'c use ol them at present. r (4) Yemen. 1Q o- 3 ?- ,T he tW ?.. fr0 , n v er delimitation committees, which towards the end of t h lt d T beg T fV ,e t mil / a i I0n of the Saudi-Yemeni frontiers in accordance 21st Fl e J; r v V4 T a V f 0f May r re Stated by the of the submitted nrnnl! 3 ! 6 ’ to b y e c °mpleted their work in complete amity and to have ori^te smmS 1 ; , had b T n , approved by both Governments.

P sh ° wm S ^e frontier as delimitated. The onlv use of this map which was thi Zt dlaW \ to ,^ le ’ WaS 11 showed the names of the places between which the frontier is held to run. The Aden authorities received information about a dispute between the commissioners about the allocation of the fort near Khoba Inch was claimed by both parties—a dispute which was ended by the destruction of the fort m accordance with article 5 of the Treaty of Taif which nrohibits the construction of fortified buildings within 5 kilom. of the frontier. P 31. By article 6 of the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Brotherhood and Alliance the parties undertook to endeavour to secure the adhesion of the Yemen to the treaty • “l I ma ™ apparently appointed a committee to report to him on the treaty and m June Sa.y.d Muhammad Zabara, described as the Amir of the Imam Yahva’s palace was stated by the Umm-al-Qura to have been sent to Iraq to neootnte about this treaty. These negotiations, if they ever took pface wefe not successful, for the possibility of securing’ the adhesion of thp Vompn discussed at Riyadh when the new Iraq Foreign Minister went there in November^ and it was suggested that, as the Imam was suspicious of Ibn Saud the Irao Government should send a delegation to the Yemei for this purpose According o in brmation given by Dr. Naji to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad this proposal was approved by the Iraq Government, who, however decided to’send A 4^ January a large number of Yemenis were deported from Saudi Arabia. This was not directed against the Yemen, it would seem but was nart f a general effort to get rid of undesirables. Many Somalis, for instance, were13 deported at the same time. Nevertheless, it was believed that what prompted this action was the Yemeni attempt on the King’s life in 1935. A large band of Yemeni pilgrims travelling to Mecca by land was delayed at the frontier for some time. First, it seems, permission for them to travel by the land route at all was refused by the Saudi authorities, and when it was at last granted, there was trouble about the dues to be paid. But the dispute was settled eventually. At the end of the year Saiyid Muhammad Zabara arrived at Riyadh on what was described by the Mecca press as a private mission from the King of the Yemen, and it was believed that his object was to try to induce Ibn Saud to make large reductions in the charges on Yemeni pilgrims, particularly those who travel by land. 33. Ibn Saud watches the situation in the Yemen very carefully, and towards the end of the year there were signs that it was giving him particular anxiety. The disturbances which might follow the death of the King of the ^emen, owing, for instance, to the well-known hostility between the heir apparent and some of his numerous brothers, must enter into all Ibn Saud’s calculations, and towards the end of the year it was clear that he was watching the Yemen frontier with particular interest. He could probably deal with any repercussion that internal disturbances in the Yemen might have upon Saudi Arabia, but what if Italy should use the disturbances as a pretext for intervention? He expressed his anxiety on this point to His Majesty’s Government in December through his Minister in London. 34. The King of the Yemen complained to the Saudi Government that Mr. Pliilby, accompanied by an armed Saudi guard, had entered Yemen territory at Jauf and Marib. The Saudi Government disclaimed responsibility, as they did when the Legation complained of a similar adventure of Mr. Philby’s into the Aden Protectorate. Fuad Bey, however, remarked to His Majesty’s Minister that perhaps the Imam only thought the places visited by Mr. Philby formed part of Jauf and Marib. 35. The King of the Yemen was one of the Arab rulers whose appeal to the Arab Higher Committee helped to bring about the cessation of the disorders in Palestine. He played a minor part, compared with Ibn Saud, but that this was not due to lack of interest was shown by statements made by him to Captain Seager, who visited him from Aden in October. 36. There is usually little to record under this head, but this year mention must be made of a journey which Mr. Philby made into the Aden Protectorate with a considerable Saudi escort. This visit, which he made without giving notice, still less asking for permission, aroused some apprehension and anxiety among certain inhabitants of the Protectorate and gave the Aden Government (5) Aden Protectorate. [15154]Government quite clear, and in the absence of Fuad Bey he wrote a personal letter to the^Minister for Foreign Affairs expressing the pleasure with which His Majesty’s Government had received the Saudi assurance, which confirmed AT s ^PP^ slt i on the y had already formed, but pointing out that the arrival of Mr. Fhilby in the Aden Protectorate with an armed Saudi force might have caused an incident or have led the local tribes to suppose that Mr. Philby had come on a mission from the Saudi Arab Government. In his personal reply, the Amir haisal was so anxious to defend the Saudi Government that he spoiled his case by trying to defend Mr. Philby, too, Avith arguments, moreover, which had clearly been supplied by Mr. Philby himself. It was impossible to leave this as tne last, word, so in another letter and in conversation with Fuad Bey His i ^ajesty s Minister, basing his case on the visit to Shabwa, made clear the attitude ot Mis Majesty s Government in regard to the frontier of the Aden Protectorate, and insisted that, in obtaining a Saudi escort for a legitimate purpose and using at “ V1 \ t0 Saudi Government, for a different and an illegitimate purpose, Mr. Philby had played a nasty trick on them, and ought to be told so by them. ^ h ls shouid be the end of the matter as against the Saudi Government. ' When fi/’ 11 ^ T et i Urn i S . to /h e dd a ( at the end of the year he was believed to be visiting the Farsan Islands), he will certainly have a self-righteous explanation of his a ? 1 ^' 0 Jt is considered unlikely that Ibn Saud encouraged or authorised the visit to Shabwa, for to do so would have been at variance with his general attitude towards His Majesty s Government throughout the year; though he can hardly nn! 1 t0 he secretly flattered if Mr. Philby tells him how easily, with the aid of the H SaUd a ? d a fu Ud L eSCOrt \ he P enetrated to a town (Shabwa) which is dimcult ot access from the Aden side. 37. The Iishad faction in Java was represented in Mecca for some months tins year by a native of the Hadhramaut, Sheikh Uthman-al-’Amudi, who is said o be the head of the movement in Java. He seems to have tried to induce Ibn baud to interest himself in Hadhramaut affairs, and to have concerned himself M TT a u? r ° J 5 0r 4- Stab i lshmg Schools ’ P resumabl y under Irshadi influence, in the Hadhramaut His efforts apparently ended m disappointment as to Ibn Saud who merely gave him some books for the schools, and in disillusionment as to the state of civilisation m the Hejaz, which had been painted to him in more favour able colours than the facts warranted. When last heard of, he was reduced to an attempt to obtain the signatures of leading Hadhramis living in Mecca to a petition addressed to the Sultan of Mukalla, asking for certain reforms. One ° f ^ P r °P^edReforms has a Wahabi tinge, in that it demands that the peopln^^ 1 Saiyids should be sub ject to taxation on the same terms as other 38 Some thirty Hadhramis presented a petition to the Legation claiming to be the only Hadhramis in the Hejaz who had not adopted Saudi nationality and asking the Legation to appoint one of their number to represent them in dealings with the Saudi Government and other purposes. It is true that in former times the Hadhrami community in the Hejaz had a sheikh who performed certain representative functions on their behalf, but he was appointed, not by he British consulate in Jedda, but by the local authorities. Moreover this custom had fallen into abeyance from the time of the Saudi conquest and for the Legation to intervene to try to revive it would have been lookin'* for trouble Tt was not even certain that all the petitioners were entitled to British protection for only about five of them appeared to have passports. The request was refused’ Later one of the petitioners declared that the spokesman was required only for inadvisable 1 ^ ^ Ma]6Sty 8 Le g atlon - but even this seemed unnecessaryand (to Muscat and Oman. S9. Thanks to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom appeal was made the Legation is now better informed about the situation in the hfnter- land of Muscat than it was (and than Fuad Bey was) last year when it was supposed that A1 Kharusi and A1 Khalili, one of which is a tribe and the other a family were both persons. The facts which are relevant to the question of the frontier to be adopted to divide Saudi Arabia from Oman are these7— (1) Although the Sultan of Muscat calls himself Sultan of Muscat and Oman the Omanis are for practical purposes independent.15 [15154] B 8 (2) The Omanis would find it difficult to break the treaty with Muscat or to show any other act of hostility, as the Sultan holds all the ports from which they get their goods. (3) Any threat by the Sultan to the Omanis’ independence, of which they are extremely jealous, might encourage them to effect a rapprochement with Ibn Saud, but no such threat is likely ever to be offered. (4) A few of the Ghafiri tribes, such as the Bani Bu ’Ali, are Wahabis. The Ibadhi sect, to which the majority of the Hinawi tribes of Oman belong, has certain affinities with Wahabism, but the Ibadhis are jealous of their stronger rival and dread absorption by it. (5) “ The Omanis, secure in the enjoyment of their virtual independence, are well satisfied with the present state of affairs, and only the danger of some great and unforeseen upheaval is ever likely to make them wish to change it.” (The Political Agent, Muscat.) 40. What seemed likely to become an awkward incident arose out of a murder which occurred in 1935, when a Nejdi who set out with some goods for Khaburah, and thence to Dhahira, was killed on the way, and all his belongings were stolen, by his own guide. The murderer took refuge with the Sheikh of Yankul, a village in Dhahira, who offered to pay the Amir of Hasa blood-money. The Amir, the newly-appointed son and successor of Ibn Jiluwi, apparently refused to’ accept blood-money, and demanded the surrender of the murderer, though Yankul is well within the Oman boundary, even on the extreme Saudi reckoning. The sheikh hesitated to give the wanted man up, and it was feared that the Amir of Hasa might instigate the neighbouring tribes to attack the Dhahira people. Eventually the sheikh persuaded the murderer to leave Yankul and seek refuge elsewhere. It was reported that the murderer was later captured by the Amir and sent to Hasa for trial. (7) Trucial Sheikhs and Qatar. 41. No attempt by Ibn Saud to interfere in these territories falls to be reported this year. A rumour came to the Political Agent at Bahiein fiom several sources that the Sheikh of Qatar proposed to visit Ibn Saud at Hasa, but no such visit was paid. Perhaps the rumours were baseless, or perhaps the sheikh changed his mind after an interview in which the Political Agent told him about the Saudi claim to Jabal Naksh and warned him not to commit himself about the frontier if he should go to see Ibn Saud. If any other of the Gulf sheikhs \isited Ibn Saud this year, the Legation never heard about it. The first draft of the proposed Saudi-Iraq Treaty that came to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Govern ment contained provisions designed to encourage interference by both parties in the affairs of Persian Gulf territories in which His Majesty’s Government have special interests, but the objectionable clause was struck out. The alleged agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Saud, to which a bi ief reference was made in paragraph 37 of the 1935 Report led to a discussion which lasted for several months. The sheikh, challenged by the Political Agent at Bahrein, denied the assertion of Fuad Bey that there had been correspondence between him and Ibn Jiluwi, in which the sheikh had recognised Ibn Saud's right to Jabal Naksh, and he could think of no correspondence into which any such meaning could be read, except that possibly (though he could not be certain) Ibn Saud or Ibn Jiluwi might have written to him asking for permission to collect zakat from Saudi tribesmen grazing their flocks and herds near Jabal Dukhan. Fuad Bey tried to get His Majesty’s Minister to say “yes” to the hypothetical question whether the Sheikh of Qatar was not a free agent for international purposes before 1916 (it was in this year that the relations between Qatar and His Majesty s Go\ernment were embodied in an agreement), and whether any agreement concluded between the sheikh and Ibn Saud before that date was not in consequence binding upon His Majesty’s Government; but this attempt was not successful. On instructions from His Majesty’s Government Sir Andrew Ryan informed luad Bey that His Majesty’s Government had been unable to trace any such agreement, told him of the sheikh’s denial, and repeated a reserve which he had already made, that in asking for further information His Majesty’s Government did not necessarily admit that if the existence of such an agreement were established they could recognise it as a valid instrument. Fuad Bey’s attitude on this occasion was evasive, and he did not refer to the matter again before he left for abroad about16 a month later. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin proved to be even more evasive and eventually he informed Sir Andrew Ryan after, as he said, consultation with the King, that they did not wish to touch on Sir Andrew Ryan’s conversation with Fuad Bey about the agreement with Qatar: Sir Andrew Ryan or any other British representative could follow up what had been said, upon Fuad Bey’s return. In fact the King threw Fuad Bey and the alleged agreement heavily ^ overboard. To make the position quite clear Sir Andrew Ryan said that he could only draw one conclusion from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s attitude, viz., that the King disavowed Fuad Bey and did not endorse Fuad Bey’s statement regarding the existence of the alleged pre-1916 agreement. 42. At this interview Sheikh Yusuf Yasin said that the King had not in the past recognised any specific limits to the territories of the Persian Gulf rulers, though he always treated them in a liberal spirit. When the Ikhwan system was being organised he had directed the Ikhwan not to go into Dukhan or the Araiq, in order that they should not incommode “ Ibn Thani.” The conver sation turned to the letter which Ibn Saud had written to the Sheikh of Qatar about the oil concession, and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s attitude compelled Sir Andrew' Ryan to repeat the warning which he had had to utter, that if the threat contained in the King’s letter were carried out, His Majesty’s Government would be bound to protect what they believed to be the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar. Sir Andrew Ryan also made our attitude on the question of correspondence quite clear. The Saudi Government might think, contrary to our view, that they were ree to address the Sheikh of Qatar direct, but if the sheikh received any com munication from the Saudi Government, he was not merely free, but under an obligation, to inform His Majesty’s Government about it. (8) Bahrein. 43. The Bahrein Transit Dues Agreement embodied in the notes which were exchanged on the 16th-17th November, 1935 (paragraph 42 of the 1935 report) removed the only considerable ground of friction between Saudi Arabia and liahrem. 1 he text of the agreement was published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 17th January 1936 In order, perhaps, to mark the conclusion of the agreement Uie rulers exchanged presents, Ibn Saud sending three motor cars to the Ruler of Bahrein in return for a present of ten hawks and twenty camels. 44. The protest from the Iranian Government which was elicited by the agreement is dealt with more fully in the section on Iran. In their reply to the Iranian Government the Saudi Government claimed that Bahrein used to belong to the ancestors of Ibn baud, but said that they now recognised Sheikh Hamad-bim ^ aS Amlr - , [ the Bahrein Amirate. The suspicions of the Government of India were aroused by the use of the word “Amir” in the Saudi reply, in place of the “Amir 0 ”^Jh elnS h ‘ s t toncal title of “Sheikh”; they fea?ed tha? the word l A s n had a e ?u USe u to v UggeSt that the sheikh was in som e way subordinate to Ibn Saud, and thought that it might perhaps be well to remind the Saudi authorities of the sheikh’s correct title. The point was examined carefully' but it was found that the use of the titles “ Amir” and “ Sheikh” was too vague for of ^Bahrein'as “ AmR’^Th^M 6 Government’s reference to the Sheikh or mnrein as Amir. The title Amir is used, it is true for relativelv unimportant Governors such as those of Tebuk and Kaf, and though the Amirs KW X ? a ’ &amp;c A are Highnesses they are subordinate to their father the of S; Amir” 0n A?a e in 0th the title bears ^ i £ ^f in ’ .kae title Sheikh, which has long been the title of the rulers of Koweit and Bahrein, is used on the Red Sea side of Arabia for any townsman of consequence whom the title of “ Effendi ” or “Rev” does not suit. Thus Yusuf Yasin, who must he tonim ^ 7 y -r not all the Amirs in Saudi Arabia, is always styled “Sheikh Yusuf Yasin*’ It was decided to take no action at the moment, but'to watch for any si urn of a desire on the part of Ibn Saud to place the Sheikh of Bahrein in a position of subordination with respect to himself position olusual for the Governor of Hasa and the Sheikh of Bahrein to correspond direct about important official matters, Sir Andrew Ryan couched in mild language the remonstrance which he felt bound to make. Fuad Bey had spoken of the direct correspondence as having passed in the ordinary course, but Sir Andrew Ryan, while admitting that correspondence between local authorities on^ routine matters might be necessary and desirable, e.g., between the Director of Customs in Hasa and subordinate authorities in Bahrein, reiterated his views about direct corres pondence on official matters between the Saudi Government and the Persian Gulf States with which His Majesty’s Government were in special relations, said that he considered correspondence about a formal agreement to be undesirable, and pointed out that at the very least such correspondence was apt to lead to confusion, as it had done in the case in point and on other occasions in the past. 46. When Sir Andrew Ryan visited the Persian Gulf in 1935 he discussed informally with the Resident and the Political Agents concerned a suggestion of his own that it would strengthen the position as aga inst Ibn Saud in discussions affecting Bahrein and Koweit if means could be found to comer upon the sheikhs the title of “ His Highness.” While aware of the difficulties, Sir Andrew Ryan had long felt it a drawback, he said, that in correspondence with the Saudi Government, in which he had so often to impress upon them the impoitance attached by His Majesty’s Government to the position of the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit as independent rulers, he should have to use the title of “his Excellency,” which, however respectable, was normally borne by subjects and, moreover, had nowhere been so belittled by indiscriminate use as in the Near and Middle East. Later, Sir Andrew Ryan’s suggestion was discussed by the authorities concerned, with regard to the possible effect of its adoption upon the two sheikhs in question and the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast. The matter was still undecided at the end of the year. 47. The creation of a Saudi port on the Persian Gulf, at Ras Tanura or elsewhere, would injure the Bahrein transit trade considerably, and Bahrein therefore watches with apprehension the efforts in that direction which are being made by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. (9) Koweit. 48. Having modified his intransigent attitude towards Koweit, as was recorded in paragraph 46 of the 1935 report, Ibn Saud went even further and at the end of January 1936 paid a state visit to the sheikh. His arrival in style, with 673 officials and attendants in 145 cars and lorries, was matched by the magnificent welcome accorded to him. The Mecca Saut-al-Hejaz reported this visit as a “visit to the frontiers of Koweit in accordance with the request of the Amir of Koweit,” and there is this much truth in the report, that when the sheikh visited Riyadh in 1932 he invited Ibn Saud to return the visit, and Ibn Saud accepted the invitation in principle. The Saudi Legation in London informed the Foreign Office that the visit w^as purely personal and not for the purpose of discussing business, and after the visit the sheikh assured the Political Agent that he and Ibn Saud had had no political conversations. The Political Agent points out the improbability that two Arabs of importance should be together long without talking politics, but suggests that it was probably true that politics were not the immediate object of the visit and that any political conversations were general and incidental. Ibn Saud has since sent the sheikh a cordial invitation to pay him a return visit. The Political Agent judged from what the sheikh said that he would probably act on the invitation some time— perhaps in the spring of 1937. 49. Ibn Saud was delighted with his reception at Koweit, and at once told Fuad Bey of his gratification, and instructed him to do his best to promote a settlement of the blockade question. The modified Saudi proposals referred to in the last report were already being discussed with the sheikh by the Political Agent at Koweit. The sheikh agreed to the institution of a system of manifests for caravans and dhows leaving Koweit, to the establishment of customs posts and the adoption of fixed routes, to giving an assurance that he would do his best to prevent smuggling, and to provision for denunciation of the proposed agreement at short notice, but he refused to apply the manifest system to the [15154] b 918 Bedouin shopping known as “ musabila ” or to the issue of identity or other control documents (other than manifests) at the Koweit end for outgoing caravans or individuals. 50. It was decided to take advantage as soon as possible of the more accommodating disposition shown by Fuad Bey, and after some discussion between the various British authorities concerned as to the best procedure it was agreed that the sheikh should draft a set of regulations designed to meet the Saudi views as far as possible. This was done, and when the draft had been approved by the Government of India and by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom it was communicated to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in a personal letter from Majesty s Charge d’Affaires dated the 9th July. In forwarding the draft to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Koweit had suggested that if the proposals should prove acceptable to the Saudi Government they should come into force on the 1st October, at about which time goods are required in Arabia for supplying the Bedouin before they leave the permanent wells tor their winter wanderings. As agreement had not been reached by the end of the year, the date on which it should come into force has not yet come up tor discussion. Similarly it has not yet been necessary to act on a plan suggested by the Foreign Office and found suitable by His Majesty’s Chargd a Anaires, that if the proposals were acceptable to the Saudi Government the agreement should be recorded in an Anglo-Saudi exchange of notes wherein on he one hand, the Saudi Arab Government would agree to discontinue the blockade as from the entry into force of the regulations, while on the other hand His Majesty s Government m the United Kingdom would convey the pledge bv the sheikh to use all his endeavours to prevent smuggling and would add their assuiance to do all in their power to ensure the observance of the pledge. 51 In conversation with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires Sheikh Yusuf asm harped continually on the possibility that caravans nominally bound for iacj might enter Saudi Arabia and on the consequent necessity that every caravan leaving Koweit should take out a manifest, and in November he informed the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, then on a visit to Riyadh, that the Saudi Goveinment would regard the proposed Koweit-Saudi anti-smuggling agreement more favourably if a similar agreement were concluded between Koweit and Iraq, as that would result in the control of all caravans leaving Koweit At Tranl KmLit he yea .' : actl0n ha » i ust be £ un with a view t0 the settlement of all the^nestTnn M tl0n r th ^ m smu gS lln g- being understood that, while the question of smuggling from Koweit to Iraq should not be linked up with thflat f t SmU h gg m S fr ° m Ko '’ elt . lnt0 Sau di Arabia, the principles worked out for the latter shou d serve as a basis of discussion for the former Even though the in h n mm fee® 'tp be con a ected m , the negotiations they would be complementary practice There may be something in Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s fear that o-oods “^iftTrue haThi SM by de ™us routes mto S^udi laom it is tiue that the ^audi authorities ought to police the frontier but if the Iraq Government have been unsuccessful in this policy (and in spite of great hopes based on important revenue captures at the end of 1* still worried about the question of smuggling a year laterl Sandi^Ar’i^ y 'Z er ? .. peer arn] l„ „„n &lt;,,, : an ! „d oo„]|Qj C to ilcSd ' Wh, ' h grass jrsrffifwr ''t™ * “ No Bedouin si Ml hAT T. “ 193 °’ and even Proposed a clause readino- : special written permission From th^sTUf S U' 1 n ° wf i' t un i ess be holds a tie kind of goodf hF'mmJ &lt; pmrch^e^from^ow(dt 0 ”^ 1 ^li 0 ^t Cla p conce f ™?d, showing put forward in this lette?, however was expressly defendid” 688 ^ the me 5 su u res it was necessary to ensure tint n-norlc ^ • ff. on f^e ground that be smuggled into Saudi Arabffi ^rho r rnin ^^ v e °nsigned to Iraq should not foreign relations of tlm Shekh oFlloweit ^Th^ 0 promia ? nce t,le question of the ue onei knot Koweit. The approaching visit was announced19 to the Legation at Jedda, when Ibn Sand had already left Riyadh for Koweit, by Fuad Bey Hamza, who asked that the authorities concerned should be warned. His Majesty’s Minister reported this message with a reference to the standing invitation of 1932, and the comment that he thought it would be inadvisable to demur to the visit provided its private character was clear, and the sheikh could be relied upon to enter into no political commitments. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf gave it as his opinion that we could not demur to the visit, and pointed out that whereas our treaties with Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhs (including Qatar) contain a specific provision that the sheikhs concerned shall have no communication with foreign rulers, and therefore inferentially should not pay or receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government, in the Koweit agreements there is nothing to prevent communications between the sheikhs and foreign rulers, and he could therefore pay and receive visits without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government. It was only on that point, Colonel Fowle added, that the foreign relations of Koweit differed from those of the other sheikhs, and even with regard to communications we had an assurance given by the sheikh to the Political Agent at Koweit in 1934, that he showed all official correspondence with Ibn Saud to the Political Agent. This question, which called for a decision in connexion with Saudi-Koweit blockade discussions, was considered at a meeting which was held at the Foreign Office on the 2nd September. Much of the discussion at that meeting lies outside the scope of this report. It is sufficient to say that it seemed to the meeting unlikely that the Saudi Government would question our right to conclude an agreement about the blockade on behalf of the sheikh; all the negotiations on the subject hitherto had passed through His Majesty’s Government, who had declared from the outset that it was one of the major questions outstanding in Anglo-Saudi relations; it is laid down in a decision taken since that meeting was held, that no approach to the sheikh, with a view to the clarification of the situation, shall be made until the agreement, which it is hoped to bring about in order to put an end to the blockade, has been concluded. 54. The question of raising the status of the Sheikh of Koweit by conferring on him the title of “ His Highness ” is dealt with above in the section on Bahrein. (10) Frontiers : Relations with the Persian Gulf Rulers in General. 55. The Mecca press published two baseless reports suggesting that some kind of federation of the Arab Amirates of the Persian Gulf was being discussed by the British authorities there. In June the Saut-al-Hejaz, repeating what was described as “ Koweit news,” said that this was one of the questions discussed at the recent “conference of consuls” at Koweit, and added that negotiations between the Amirs were believed to be taking place, and that they had agreed to a form of federation for external affairs which would leave them free in internal matters. In December the Unim-al- Qura reported, on the authority of “ private information from Bahrein,” that Colonel Fowle had been authorised to hold “ a special British conference ” of the consuls in the Gulf to decide about the political status of the amirates and their unification in matters of means of communica tion and customs dues. These reports presumably represent some suspicion in the mind of the King, aroused perhaps by things which had to be said in the course of the frontier negotiations, that His Majesty’s Government wish to strengthen the Gulf rulers as against himself. He may fear that the status of the Trucial sheikhs and Qatar would be enhanced, and his position in regard to them diminished if they were linked up in some way with the admittedly bigger fry of Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat. (B)— With Powers outside Arabia. (1) British Commonwealth of Nations. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 56. Relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Arabian Government in 1936, centred mainly round two questions, viz., relations with Italy, and the troubles in Palestine. Both these questions are [15154] B 10dealt with in some detail elsewhere, but it is appropriate to quote here from a despatch addressed to His Majesty’s Minister by the Foreign Office on the 29th December, in which was given the tenour of statements made on various occasions in the course of conversations between representatives of the Foreign Office and the Saudi Minister in London. The Minister was informed, with reference to King Ibn Saud’s natural anxiety at the apparent development of Italian designs in South-Western Arabia, that His Majesty’s Government were under no illusions regarding the activities of the Italians. On the other hand, the extent to which the Italians might be prepared to go in violating their under takings to His Majesty’s Government under the Rome understanding of 1927 would necessarily depend to a very large extent on the course of Anglo-Italian relations in Europe and the Mediterranean. If, as seemed probable, some kind of detente were reached with the Italians over these major questions, it would be less likely that they would provoke a conflict with His Majesty’s Government by violating the obligations which Rome had assumed towards them in Arabia in 1927. The key to the situation was, in fact, in so far as Italy was concerned, out side Arabia. In these circumstances, while His Majesty’s Government appreciated intensely the friendly and correct attitude which King Ibn Saud had continuously maintained towards them, and more particularly in so far as the question of their policy in Palestine was concerned, and while their policy in Arabia was based, as His Majesty knew, on the principle of the maintenance of a strong well-governed and wholly independent Saudi Arabian State, it would not be possible for them, for the reasons which had already been explained by Sir Andrew Ryan a year ago, to give King Ibn Sand any direct guarantee in so far as Italy might be concerned. This did not mean, however, that they would view any Italian penetration in Arabia with indifference, or that their attitude towards King Ibn Saud was in any way less cordial or friendly. It merely meant that they were unable to enter into any specific commitment in regard to Arabia in matters where the deciding factors would depend primarily on the develop ments of high European policy. 57. The troubles in Palestine gave to Ibn Saud a remarkably favourable opportunity to enhance his position in the Arab world, and at the same time to place His Majesty’s Government under an obligation. Within the limits of the occasion he gave proof of those sentiments towards His Majesty’s Government which he had always claimed to possess, and if he looked beyond-that occasion to the possibility that the entire Arab world might some day be free from European domination, we cannot be surprised at that. His conduct throughout the Palestine crisis tended to bear out the definition which was given in paragraph 6 of the 1935 report, where Sir Andrew Ryan described the King’s attitude as evolving not in the direction of promoting the creation of a single united Arabia under one head, but of consolidating the mutual relations of the principal independent Arab States already in existence and making this serve the realisation of national aspirations in other Arab areas.” If the first proposals placed before the Iraq Government for a treaty of alliance contained provisions for a policy of inter ference in Arab territories with which His Majesty’s Government and the French Government are in special relations, those provisions were dropped very quickly and in other respects Ibn Saud showed no tendencv to interfere in this way His relations with Koweit improved, and his denial that Mr. Philbv’s expedition into the Aden Protectorate had had any express or tacit authorisation from him was accepted. There is reason to believe that the Turkish claims in respect of Alexandretta and Antioch administered a salutary shock to him. It could hardlv fail to bring home to him the weakness of the “ Arab world ” against assault by a powerful and resolute enemy like Turkey. Fuller consideration of this question however, belongs to the following year. ’ 58. Official relations in Jedda were very good, except for one or two breezes raised out of policy as a warning to the Minister for Foreign Affairs not to be too tiresome. I he Saudi Government took pains to show the greatest consideration on the sad occasion of the death of His Majestv King George V and sent thp Amir Faisal and a number of high Saudi officials toLh^Sgation to present condolences; and on being invited to send a mission to represent Saudi Arabia at the Coronation in May 1937 they decided that it should be headed by the heir apparent, the Amir Sand, who would be accompanied by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin They were particularly friendly, too, on the departure of Sir Andrew Ryan and21 the right of His Majesty’s Government to manumit slaves. 59. The Treaty of Jedda and connected Questions.—The^ negotiations on •. • . i • i i j-Pot* Vwt flip pnrl of 1935. weie ment of His Majesty’s Government to the abolition ot tneir ngnt to manumit slaves • October 1 —His Majesty’s Minister sent a confidential reply conveying a binding assurance, on behalf of His Majesty’s Government, that they would renounce their right of manumission as soon as the slavery regulation should have been promulgated. . rT 7 ^ October 2.—Slavery Regulation published m the Umm-al-Qura. October 3.—Notes exchanged between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and His Majesty’s Minister about certain matters dealt with in the Treaty of Jedda and in letters annexed to that treaty. 60. The points covered by the exchange of notes of the 3rd October were (1) Each party renounces for seven years the right conferred by article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda to give six months’ notice of its intention to terminate the treaty. (2) Article 4, which deals with the property of deceased British pilgrims, is modified by an amendment of no great importance. (3) The English and Arabic texts of the Treaty of Jedda are given equal validity by the deletion of that part of article 10 which reads : ‘ ‘ but in case of divergence in the interpretation of any part of the treaty, the English text shall prevail.” (4) Each of the parties maintains its position with regard to Aqaba and Maan, as set forth in the relevant letter annexed to the Treaty of Jedda. . (5) His Majesty’s Government renounce their right to manumit slaves with effect from the date of the exchange of notes. (6) The Saudi Government, notwithstanding what is contained in a letter dated the 19th May, 1927, annexed to the Treaty of Jedda, agree that if they should wish to purchase arms, ammunition or war materials from manufacturers in the United Kingdom, the exportation thereof shall be subject to the regulations in force in the United Kingdom at the time of exportation. 61. As there were four slaves at the Legation on the 1st October, when the exchange of notes about slavery took place, His Majesty’s Minister addressed a personal letter to the Amir Feisal on that date explaining that his signature to the final British note would be affixed on the understanding that any slaves who might happen to be in the Legation at the time of the final exchange of notes would be dealt with in accordance with the procedure in force hitherto. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin gave His Majesty’s Minister on this score personal assurances to which he acted up when the question of disposing of the last four slaves took practical shape. 62. The Saudi Arab Government were very eager to publish the complete text of the notes as soon as possible. His Majesty’s Minister felt that they wanted to draw back to Ibn Saud the attention of the Moslem world, which had recently been attracted away by the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, the French proposals about Syria, and the important role assumed by Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the negotiations about Palestine. Out of deference to the views of His Majesty’s Government, who are bound by established procedure which requires that nothing but the briefest summary of such an agreement shall be published until the text has been laid before Parliament as a White Paper, the tnese points, wnnni nciu — - — — . i i f completed before Sir Andrew Ryan left, and his successor had nothing to do but to affix his signature to the notes. The procedure was as follows : October 1.—The Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda a confidential note setting forth the steps already taken Kir rhp ftandi Government to bring- the slave trade generally to an end, and these :— [15154] B 11mmm —— 22 n Saudi Government agreed to postpone publication. His Majesty’s Government were prepared to agree to publication as an exceptional measure if the Saudi Government attached serious importance to it, but the latter published in the Umm-al-Qura so full a summary that the appearance of the complete text would nave added little to the knowledge of the public, and by the end of the year they had made no further reference to publication of the text. One reason for this may have been that the exchange of notes attracted little interest. The Umm-al-Qura published a leading article containing a disclaimer that the relations of Saudi Arabia with His Majesty’s Government differ from those with any other Govern ment, and a wish for the continued success of the wise policy adopted by the Saudi brovernment ‘ in the interests of Islam in general and of the Arabs in particular— and more especially of the people of Saudi Arabia.” 63. Saudi-Transjordan Paragraph 59 of the 1935 report explains the situation as it appeared at Jedda at the end of that year. Meanwhile, owever, e 1 lansJordan authorities had discovered an alternative car-track avoiding the easterly bend round the Maizila bluff, which appears in the 1918 map ^T t0ry ’ a J nd 111 their o P ini0n this removed the sole objection to the acceptance of the second proposal put forward by Fuad Bey in London, viz that respfcSf with f r e p a f UreS shoi j ld b f ^igned to Transjordan and Saudi Arabia Th\'c } I th u erence e ^ t0 their P°sition as shown in the 1918 map his opinion having been confirmed by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee statement of 7h^ t0 ty ’ s Mini ster to press Fuad Bey for a thfn^n -f f t f he , Saud i v i ews which he had undertaken to ask for, bearing in mind propS’whic^ w t hl , ch ™g ht induce Fua d Bey to withdraw or modify p oposals which His Majesty s Government were now willing to accent and keepmg the question of the frontier in general separate fronfthe Son of dividual places about which the Saudi Government had made protests In descnbing the consequent conversation with Fuad Bev, Sir Andrew Ryan said • W 1 P 0Sltl0 ?.seemed to be that the geographicaffacts should be ascertained the { Tr er Sh0U J d be assj g ned with reference to'he and added that if the frontier as determinh th 1918 ma P ; inconveniently distorted there mio-hl still Ik. k&gt; ' / ' IS means proved to be mutual advantage Ihe denarture of Fnfi Tt ® T f ° r S0 , me ad “^tment with Sir Andrew Ryan to tventua ly, he sent Sheikh Yusuf on the 28th° AnrTl a lefw ^ recapitulated the history of the discussions with twit?

It is, in fact, a policy of feeling for thefinemv tT 168 ^'4 the fron tier protest, and so long as we don’t protest thev l-nnw^’h rhe,V pUsh ahead until we incontestably theirs. P St ’ the y ,vnow th ey are on territory which is23 [15154'! B 12 64. Eastern and South-Eastern Boundary .—No advance towards a settle ment on this point has been made since paragraph 57 of the 1935 report was written, except that, as is shown elsewhere, the allegation that the Sheikh of Qatar had signed away his rights over Jabal Naksh to Ibn Baud before 1916 has been exploded. The differences between the British and Saudi points of ^ view when Sir Reader Bullard reached Jedda in September were these :— (1) The Saudi Government were asking for Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, but hints continued to be given that they would cease to claim Khor- al-Odeid if they could secure Jabal Naksh. They also appeared to covet Sufuk. (2) On the extreme east the British proposal was that the line should follow longitude 55 east, the Saudi proposal that it should follow 56 east. (3) On the south the Saudi Government were claiming, in addition to what His Majesty’s Government had offered, a band of territory varying in width from about 1 degree of latitude at the ends to about 2 degrees in the middle. 65. The only point on which His Majesty’s Government had held out hope of a further concession was the second. They had made it clear that they regarded both Jabal Naksh and Khor-al-Odeid as essential. The question of Sufuk— though this is a minor point—had apparently not been studied closely. The Chief Commissioner of Aden was strongly opposed to any further concession on the part of the frontier affecting the Aden Protectorate and the Hadhramaut; he considered that to carry further south in that sector the line proposed by His Majesty’s Government would give Ibn Saud a footing within the border territory of the Hadhramaut and the possibility of an extension of his influence which would have a disturbing effect on the treaty chiefs and their people in those regions, besides opening the way to interference in the grazing and watering rights of the tribes concerned. 66. So the matter might have remained, for although it would be a good thing in principle to add the frontier question to the list of cases settled, no difficulty arose in practice in 1936 from the lack of definition of the frontiers on the east and south-east. In October, however, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) informed the Foreign Office that the Ruba-al-Khali probably contained important oil resources, and that they would like to obtain from I bn Saud a concession covering all ’the territory under his sovereignty east of meridian 48 and not already included in the concession granted to the Standard Oil Company of California, up to such boundary as might eventually be agreed upon between him and His Majesty’s Government. The Foreign Office pointed out that such an application would perhaps give Ibn Saud an exaggerated idea of the economic value of the area in dispute and make him even more difficult in his dealings with His Majesty’s Government on this point, and said that they would prefer the company not to approach Ibn Saud until the frontier negotiations had gone a good deal further, and at any rate not for another six months. 67. The question was taken up with Fuad Bey late in the year, and on his return from seeing Ibn Saud he expressed these views. Sir Andrew Ryan’s impression that the Saudi Government were prepared to compromise was due to a misunderstanding of Fuad Bey’s idea, which was that he and His Majesty s Minister should try to find some middle course to recommend to their Govern ments. He had no counter-proposals to make to the latest offer of His Majesty’s Government. The southern boundary proposed by the Saudi Government was based on the essential needs of the tribes in that area. The British suggestion that the line along longitude 55 east might be moved eastwards was not of much interest to the Saudi Government, since the country thereabouts was desert. Fuad Bey appeared to be taking advantage of the change of Minister when he suggested that His Majesty’s Government attached the greatest importance to Khor-al- Odeid, but much less to Jabal Naksh, which the Saudi Government regarded as most important. His Majesty’s Minister held out no hope of any concession beyond the one mentioned, and could only promise to report to the Foreign Office. He informed the Foreign Office that but for the complication introduced by oil he would have been in favour of leaving the question of the eastern and smR* 1 ' eastern frontier in abeyance. As it was, he could only suggest (1) that luad Bey should be informed, in order that the Saudi Government might remain under noillusion on this point, that His Majesty 's Government regarded both Jabal Naksh and Khor-al-Odeid as essential, but should be asked on what other parts of the frontier he thought that he and His Majesty's Minister could produce joint proposals that would appeal to their Governments; (2) that meanwhile it should be considered whether His Majesty’s Government could afford to offer further slight concessions at Sufuk and on the borders of Oman and the Aden Protec torate. He added that he knew the difficulties in the second suggestion, and that he doubted whether concessions in those areas would induce Ibn Saud to make a formal renunciation of Jabal Naksh, but that he saw no other alternative than these to the policy of doing nothing which was ruled out by the aims of the Petroleum Concessions (Limited). It may be added, to anticipate a little, that early in January 1937 the Foreign Office authorised His Majesty’s Minister to act on the first of the two suggestions. 68. Aiv Facilities on the Hnsn Coast .—Just before he left Sir Andrew Hyan had a long conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in which he referred to the letter on this subject written by Mr. Pendel to Fuad Bey on the 25th June, 1935, and to Fuad Bey’s reply of the 6th July, since which time the matter had remained in abeyance owing to the pressure of more urgent affairs. A full record of this conversation was sent to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 11th June. Sir Andrew Ryan set iorth the views of His Majesty’s Government on the four conditions laid down J. n -}? e y s letter the 6th July, 1935. They demurred to the view that facilities for Imperial Airways should be treated by direct negotiations with the company independently of any arrangements for service aircraft, and trusted that the Saudi Government would reconsider the matter. As to the condition that facilities for the Royal Air Force should be embodied in a definite agreement they were not clear as to the reservation made by Fuad Bey; they thought that the two general permissions they had asked for, viz., that aircraft might be allowed to fly over Saudi territorial waters within gliding distance of the coast and that in case of emergency the Royal Air Force should be free to send assistance to stranded aircraft, would have to be discussed in detail before a formal agree ment could be arrived at, and that the agreement should be in the form of an exchange of notes. They noted the statement of Fuad Bey that the Saudi Govern ment would expect a fixed annual payment for any facilities granted, and they would be prepared to pay for any work involved in the provision of facilities, and to pay a moderate sum for upkeep of grounds, beacons, &amp;c. As to the proposed beacon on Jmnah Island to guide aircraft at night, while His Majesty’s Govern ment understood the wish of the Saudi Government to ensure respect for their soveieign rights and would readily agree that any non-Saudi experts required ■ f erec ^ lon or maintenance of the beacon should be accompanied by Saudi o hcials and proceed to Jinnah Island under the Saudi flag, they thought that it would be very difficult for the Saudi authorities, in the absence of such experts to carry out the work themselves. Finally, His Majesty’s Government hoped that m due course the Saudi Government would co-operate in the supply of meteorological information. 1 f 6 U 9 - . S / r Andrew Ryan left the matter for Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to study and to submit to the King for his views. No comment on the record of this conver sation, which was sent to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, had been made by the end of the year. Sir Reader Bullard suggested in November that as the Italians might perhaps use the help they were giving to the Saudi Government in matters of aviation as a pretext for requesting permission for Italian aircraft to flv down e f e( | k ea coast of Arabia, and as any facilities granted on the Persian Gulf ddfin if f our 7' e fl^ est i. u l} im P ortant though they might be, might make it more I° r he Saudl , Governm f t to refuse the Italian application, we should refrain from pressing for a reply to our proposals for the present. rJ 0 .' The He jaz Railway .—The conclusions of the technical conference held at Haifa m October 1935 to consider various questions relating to the Heiaz Railway formed the subject of a note which was addressed to the British and Irench Legations at Jedda on the 20th January, 1936. The note pointed out that the conference had drawn up a basis of agreement” in respect of four items of the agenda, viz., (1) degree of reconditioning required; (2) estimate of the cost of the necessary work; (4) organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway; and (5) method of distribution of rolling-stock among the various25 sections of the line. The note expressed great regret, however, that the conference had not been able to come to an agreement on the third item in the agenda, viz., the manner in which the cost of the work should be met, but had merely taken note of the proposal of the principal Saudi delegate, to the effect that the recon struction of the damaged sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, and had commended the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned. The note then quoted the French delegate as stating that the conditions attached by the Lausanne declaration to contribution by the Syrian section towards expenditure in respect of other sections had not been fulfilled in that it had worked at a loss, and that the solution of this question must be sought in some manner other than that now proposed. Finally, the note declared that the only solution which would result in the reopening of the unserviceable portion of the line was that the line should be considered as one and should bear as a whole the expenses to be incurred on the damaged sections south of Maan. Should the British (and French) Governments accept this “fundamental principle,” there would naturally be occasion to discuss how the necessary funds should be raised, whether by loan or by other means. The note concluded by asking His Majesty’s Government to assist in the settlement of the question “ by agreeing to the principle of the unity of the line.” 71. When transmitting a translation of the Saudi note to the Foreign Office, Sir Andrew Ryan pointed out that while the Lausanne Declaration did in fact provide that surplus profits accruing from particular sections should be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the whole railway, it did not contem plate the unification of the various sections for all purposes, but rather the contrary, and stated that the Saudi Government’s suggestion that the railway should be considered a single entity was merely a particular application of their old thesis that the railway was one because it was in their view a Waqf. Sir Andrew Ryan also reported the indifference of his French colleague, which he took to be an indication of the attitude of the French authorities in Syria. In May the Foreign Office sent to the Colonial Office a semi-official letter regarding the nature of the reply to be sent to the Saudi note, but nothing further was heard of the matter at Jedda by the end of the year. It is realised that examination of the Hejaz Railway question has been crowded out by more urgent matters. 72. According to a report by His Majesty’s consul at Damascus, there was formed in Damascus in June a society calling itself the League for the Defence of the Hejaz Railway, having for its declared objects an appeal to the Moslem world for funds for the resuscitation of the line, the distribution of propaganda to that end, and the collection of technical advice about the repair of the unserviceable section. The Saudi Arabian consul in Damascus was said to have read to the members of the league a telegram from Ibn Saud assuring the league of his full support. A society with similar aims has been heard of in 1934, and the league is perhaps that society under a new name. 73. Government of India Dispensaries .—As recorded in paragraph 64 of the Annual Report for 1935, it was agreed in January 1936 that the Government of India dispensaries should in future be subject to the Foreign Dispensaries Regulations promulgated by the Saudi Government on the 4th October, 1935. Dilatoriness on the part of the Saudi authorities in issuing the licences, provided for in the regulations, for the medical personnel, for the reopening of the Mecca dispensary for the 1936 Haj, and for the clearance of medical stores from the Jedda customs led to somewhat acrimonious exchanges with Fuad Bey Hamza, who, however, in a note of the 5th February, renewed assurances previously given by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, that subject to the regulation, the Saudi Arab Government would render all possible assistance to the medical staff of the dispensaries and would do everything in their power to facilitate their work. The dispensary at Mecca was, in fact, opened on the 9th February, some five weeks later than had been hoped, but no further diffi culties were experienced during the period it was open, viz., until the 1st May. The Saudi authorities acted up to their assurances on the whole during the remainder of the year, although they showed a tendency to enlarge the provisions of the regulations on one or two points of minor importance. They certainly seemed to have lost little of their old sensitiveness on this question generally. The dispensary at Jedda worked throughout the year without hindrance, and the Mecca dispensary opened for the 1937 Haj on the 1st January, 1937.26 74. Pecuniary Claims. —The surprise occasioned in 1935 (see paragraph 65 of the 1935 report), when the Saudi Government suddenly paid 10 per cent, of the joint claim of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India was not repeated in 1936. On one occasion Sheikh Yusuf Yasin told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, spontaneously, that the Saudi Government were taking steps to pay this year an instalment equal to that paid in 1935, but the steps must have halted somewhere on the way, for no payment was made. 75. Red Sea Oil Concession. —This important concession was secured by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), a company formed under the auspices of the Iraq Petroleum Consortium, and strongly supported by His Majesty’s Govern ment. The concession is for the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to the depth of 100 kilom., exclusive of the stretch from Rabigh to Lith—presumably, out of deference to Moslem opinion. The concession includes the Farsan and other islands and the territorial waters of the concession area. An attempt by the Italian Legation to delay the grant of the concession so that Italian interests might tender for the oil rights in the Farsan Islands was a failure. Other British Governments. 76. Again no question arose between Saudi Arabia and the self-governing Dominions. The Government of India were particularly interested in the dispensary question and also in the question of the pilgrimage. These matters are dealt with in separate sections. There was correspondence designed to bring about an agreement for the reciprocal service of summonses, but it had not been concluded when the year came to an end. (2) France and Syria. 77. The French Consulate in Jedda was duly raised to the status of a Legation. In February M. Maigret presented letters of credence as Minister Resident, and in August fresh letters as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. On the first occasion M. Maigret presented to Ibn Saud on behalf of the French Government the Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour, and this was followed a few months later by the gift of an aeroplane—a Caudron Renault Pelican four-seater. 78. A Frenchman representing the Soci6te frangaise des P^troles, a member of the Iraq Petroleum Consortium, which obtained the Red Sea Oil Concession through Petroleum Concessions (Limited), a company formed under its auspices, came to the Hejaz to help in the negotiations, but fell ill and took no part in them. The belief that his company had the backing of the French Government was confirmed by the fact that he travelled in a French naval sloop. 79. The negotiations conducted by M. Maigret at Sana were continued during two visits in 1936 and ended in the signature of a treaty of friendship on the 23rd April. 80. The arrangement by which France is converting her relationship with Syria from that of mandatory to that of ally removes the main, perhaps the only, possible cause of disturbed relations between France and Saudi Arabia—until the Arab rulers begin to interest themselves in Tunis, Algeria and Morocco. The arrangement was welcomed with satisfaction by a—doubtless inspired—article in a Mecca newspaper as another step on the road to the independence of Arab territories and eventual Arab union. The article, however, described the terms granted to Syria as less favourable than those granted by His Majesty’s Government to Egypt. 81. M. Maigret showed little interest in the result of the conference held at Haifa in 1935 to consider questions affecting the Hejaz Railway. His attitude was that all proposals with a view to reconditioning the line for through services were so unpractical as not to be worth bothering about. In this he was believed to be echoing the views of the French authorities in Syria, with whom he is in closer touch than he is with Paris. 82. The double matrimonial alliance with the Shalan family (paragraph 73 of the 1935 report) was completed in April 1936 when the second grand-daughter27 of Nuri-al-Shalan arrived and was married to the Amir Sand—not to his satis faction, for he found that the beauty had gone to his father. Both the sisters and their brother Fawwaz seemed to enjoy great consideration in this country. (3) Italy. 83. The relations with Italy, which absorbed so much of the attention of the Saudi Government in 1935, continued to preoccupy them this year, though what had been acute anxiety perhaps calmed down to some extent towards the end. The attitude of the Saudi Government towards the war in Ethiopia was eventually defined in their reply to the League of Nations note about sanctions (paragraph 117 of the 1935 report), which they addressed to the League on the 28th January. They had carefully considered, the note said, what assistance they could give without departing from the attitude they were obliged to observe as a pacific Government on friendly terms with both belligerents. As the Govern ment responsible for the Moslem Holy Land they wished to maintain friendly and stable relations with neighbouring countries or those inhabited by Moslems, for the sake of Moslem pilgrims. On the other hand they were also anxious to support any measures designed to promote world peace, to substitute peaceful procedures and arbitration for wars and disputes, and as far as possible to restrict the area of the present conflict. As, however, Saudi Arabia was not a member of the League, they considered that their participation in economic sanctions would involve heavy responsibilities without the enjoyment of the privileges and advantages conferred on members of the League. These two considerations, viz., the unique position of Saudi Arabia in the Moslem world and non membership of the League, compelled them to observe strict neutrality in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict unless special measures should be adopted granting to States non-members of the League the same rights and privileges as those accorded to member States. 84. In the course of a conversation in January, Fuad Bey intimated to Sir Andrew Ryan, more clearly than either he or Sheikh Yusuf Yasin had done in 1935, that the Saudi Government had committed themselves definitely in the autumn to supplying the whole of the 12,000 camels required by the Italians, and that they were being subjected to strong Italian pressure to secure the completion of the contract. How many camels were eventually supplied in addition to the thousand shipped from Yanbu in November 1935 (paragraph 82 of the 1935 report) is not known. Evidence from Koweit indicates that the purchase of camels for this purpose from the Mutair ceased in December 1935. 85. It is known that there was much friction between the Italian Charge d’Affaires and the Signor Odello who gave himself out to be a merchant and contractor, but who according to a report from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin declared himself to the Saudi authorities on one occasion to be an Italian officer and uttered threats of Italian vengeance if his demands were not complied with. Both left in January, and it was learned that both had gone to Rome and that M. Persico had complained of Signor Odello’s activities and had been completely victorious. Signor Odello did not return, and his family, whom he had left behind, departed from Jedda in March. 86. ^ Towards the end of April the Saudi Government informed His Majesty’s Legation, in confidence, of an offer recently made by the Italian Government to make them a present of six aeroplanes, three of them for training pilots, the others for civil aviation. They had been obliged, they stated, to accept the offer, in accordance with their general policy of keeping up an appearance of friendly relations with Italy, but they asseverated that Ibn Saud’s fundamental policy of friendship with His Majesty’s Government remained unaltered. Sir Andrew Ryan, to whom this communication was made by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin under instructions^ from the King, replied in the sense of instructions issued by the Foreign Office when their advice was asked in 1935, viz., that, while the decision was a matter for the Saudi Government, the possibility that political or other ulterior motives might underlie the Italian offer suggested that it should be regarded with caution. Yusuf Yasin maintained that the greatest caution had been used : the Italian Charge d’Affaires had assured the Saudi Government, and at their request had even put this assurance in writing, that the sole motivewas interest in the development of aviation in this country, to which the Italian Government had already contributed by training Saudi students to become pilots. 87. A few days later Yusuf Yasin informed His Majesty’s Minister that Ibn Saud had consented to receive the Italian Charge d’Affaires at Ashaira, where the King was in camp. The King had tried to excuse himself and had only agreed to the visit when M. Persico had repeated the request four times, laying stress on the infrequency of His Majesty’s visits to Jedda, and, finally, on the unfavourable impression a refusal might have in Rome. Sir Andrew Ryan told Tusuf Yasin that he did not think the King’s reception of M. Persico would be misunderstood; it was true that the King had been in Jedda very little during the last year, and on the two occasions early in 1936 when he was there M. Persico was away. At the same time Sir Andrew Ryan recorded his assumption that M. Persico was not undertaking the laborious journey to Ashaira simply in order to say how-do-you-do, an assumption which was borne out by the account of the interview which was given to him afterwards by Sheikh Yusuf. 88. According to that account M. Persico began by thanking the King for having observed neutrality in the Italo-Abyssinian war and for not having taken part in sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted that attitude out of friendship for all concerned. M. Persico spoke of facilities afforded to Moslems in occupied parts of Ethiopia before the pilgrimage and of the happy future awaiting Moslems there, and stressed the friendly disposition of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any assurances required in this respect. He again described the offer of Italian aircraft as entirely disinterested. He spoke of the proposed renewal of the Italo-Yemen Treaty. He referred to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty, and expressed the misgivings of the Italian Government on this point. The King confined himself to polite generalities except on the question of the treaty with Iraq, where he made a reassuring statement. 89. It is possible that the consignment of Italian arms, to which reference was made in paragraph 83 of the 1935 report, was not, in fact, welcomed with enthusiasm by the Saudi Government. There was no evidence during the year that further consignments of this nature had been received, nor even of the employment of the arms composing the first consignment. Of the six aeroplanes offered by the Italians as a gift, the three instructional machines arrived in May. They were not used often, and one of them met with an accident at Taif and was completely wrecked. One of the three machines for civil use, a Caproni eight- seater (but apparently capable of holding fourteen persons), was delivered in November, but only flew for a few days. At the end of the year ten Italians, aided by a horde of local labour, were erecting a large hangar imported in sections from Italy, which had either been presented to the Saudi Government by the Italian Government or sold to them at an uneconomic price. The section on aviation gives a fuller account of these matters. The ten young Saudis sent to Italy for training in aviation (paragraph 76 of the 1935 report) returned in April 1936, having apparently made greater progress in the Italian language and in admiration of the Fascist system than in the art which they had been sent to acquire. A report in an Italian aeronautical journal that fifty more Saudis were to be trained in Italy as air pilots received no support from the facts as observed at Jedda. On the contrary, there is good reason to believe that the Saudi Government were inclining to a policy of local training for aviation. 90. On some date before that (the 13th May) on which the Italian Ambassador in London handed in at the Foreign Office the text of the Italian decree announcing the annexation of Ethiopia, the Italian Charge d’Affaires in Jedda made an oral communication to that effect to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin who subsequently informed Sir Andrew Ryan that he had said in reply that if the communication had any other object than to convey general information it did not concern the Saudi Government, who had nothing to do with the consequences of a war in which they had declared their neutrality. Yusuf Yasin was expecting a written communication on the subject, and he invited Sir Andrew Ryan’s comments. Sir Andrew gave it as his personal opinion that any Power which had previously recognised the Ethiopian Empire would be well advised, even if not a member of the League of Nations, to avoid hasty recognition of Italian annexation. Yusuf Yasin declared that his Government entirely shared this29 view. A few days later Sir Andrew Ryan, acting on instructions from the Foreign Office, informed him of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Italian decree. The copy handed in by the Italian Ambassador had been accepted under all reserve, and it had been decided to return no further reply to the Italian Government in the matter. Yusuf Yasin said that M. Persico had now notified the Italian Government’s decision to the Saudi Government in writing, and that he had since seen M. Persico and had reasserted the views of the Saudi Government regarding the effects of their neutrality, and that it had been decided to return no further answer. Would such silence, he enquired, commit his Government in any way ? Sir Andrew Ryan said that if the Saudi Government had defined their position clearly after receipt of the written communication no further reply was necessary. The attitude of the Saudi Government seemed to him, he added, analogous to that of His Majesty’s Govern ment, subject to the difference that it was based on neutrality, whereas that of His Majesty’s Government rested on other principles. In reporting this to the Foreign Office, Sir Andrew Ryan added that, while he naturally did not know exactly what Yusuf Yasin had said to the Italian Charge d’Affaires, he was satisfied that the Saudi Government did not intend to commit themselves prematurely to recognition of the Italian annexation. 91. There is no doubt that Ibn Saud was seriously disturbed by the outcome of the Italian attack on Ethiopia. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin spoke of these misgivings to Sir Andrew Ryan in May, especially in regard to a possible attack on the Yemen, and in October, when making to Sir Reader Bullard, on instructions from Ibn Saud, a summary of the King’s views on the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, he again referred to the King’s uneasiness. On both occasions replies of a generally reassuring nature were given. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit, brought back a similar account of the perturbation in the King’s mind. The implications of his language seemed to be these. Reliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Saud’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy in the case of Abyssinia, and had, in fact, let that country down. How, then, could the King have confidence in the will or the ability of His Majestv’s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea ? Commenting on the statements of Mr. Philby, Sir Andrew Ryan wrote as follows :— “ The King watches, as best he can, events in Europe, but he has little true comprehension of them, much less of such concepts as that of collective security or any sort of security upheld by moral force. He has little real interest in Abyssinia, and has seen in the recent conflict, not so much a war between Italy and an African Power, as a struggle between Italy and Great Britain. He sees in the result a sweeping victory for Italian force in this struggle. Obsessed, as he has been for years, with the fear of Italian ambitions in the Red Sea, he fears that that force may in the future be turned against the Arabian Peninsula. As a Moslem ruler still engaged in consolidating his position in Arabia and jealous of his hardly-won indepen dence, he has no genuine love for Great Britain, a Power which blocks his way in various directions, e.g., in the east and south of the peninsula, but he has much less to fear from British policy on this side of it than he thinks he has to fear from that of Italy. The only fortunate feature of this is that Ibn Saud probably believes that it was not so much the ability as the will to save Abyssinia that was wanting in the attitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment as conceived by his simple mind. He probably still believes that a breach with them would be fatal to him, and hopes against hope that they would see him through in the event of a breach between him and any other European Power. He dare not go against Great Britain. He dare not ofiend Italy. ‘ Neutrality ’ is more than ever his slogan, because, as I have said, he has seen not a war in Africa, but a conflict, not yet ended, between Great Britain and Italy. He does not yet know what its effects in Arabia may be, and it is with reference to this struggle that he clings to the slogan.” 92. There is good reason to believe that in spite of Italian blandishments and presents Ibn Saud behaved towards them with as much caution as poverty and apprehension allowed. The Italian Legation pressed hard for a delay in the grant of the Red Sea oil concession, so that Italian interests might make a bid for30 the Farsan Islands, but the concession went to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) which was strongly backed by His Majesty’s Government. Again, in the first ush ot the Italian victory over Ethiopia the doctor attached to the Italian legation m Jedda formed a plan for establishing a magnificent dispensary in the town and also, it is believed, for bringing out a lady doctor and several nurses, out the baudi Government refused to allow any extension of the Legation’s medical work which had hitherto been done, as is that of the British Legation, rom a dispensary in the Legation building, or to the proposed increase in medical stall It seems certain that Italy would be willing to take more would-be Saudi ayators for training, and that Ibn Saud is unwilling to accept the offer. At the t IaI the A e - ar i Ibn Saud was assuring the Foreign Office through his Legation in fnr tTh; m ^ 1S f d ^ e P o sus P lcl0ns of Italian designs and his unalterable friendship Quezon &gt; Gov , en ™ er ' t , His Majesty’s Minister has suggested that the question of facilities for British aircraft on the Hasa coast should remain in abeyance for a while since compliance with British requirements in this respect “or g u r’r C r Se^o Ul i f 7 .{ bn K SaUd t0 resist “y P ?ans Italians may^ve g the Red Sea coast of Arabia as an air route to Eritrea and Ethiopia. 93 The Italian Legation continued to distribute propaganda in the form of copies of Arabic newspapers published in the Italian possessions in North Africa As a rule they seemed to go in for alleged Ethiopian atrocities or fofprai ™of the Italian authorities for their care for the Moslem religion, but one such news- E' ed * V1 ? lent anti-British article in the usual vein.

M. Adriaanse, the Netherlands Charge d'Ailaires, returned from leave via Iraq, where he presented his credentials as Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, a position which, as was mentioned in paragraph 87 of the 1935 Report, he is to hold in addition to his post at Jedda. He travelled back to Jedda by way of Riyadh, where he was received by Ibn Saud, to whom he transmitted the highest class of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He received an Arab mare from Ibn Saud on this occasion as a present. Earlier in the year Ibn Saud sent to Jedda four Arab horses as a present for Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands. They were nominally from the Amir Saud and were presumably sent in recognition of the hospitality which he had enjoyed in Holland the year before, though why the Netherlands should be singled out for such a distinction is not known. 99. What has now become an annual visit to Sana from the Netherlands Legation in Jedda was paid this year by the vice-consul, a Javanese, in the absence of M. Adriaanse. (5) Soviet Russia. 100. No striking results followed the return to Jedda as Soviet Minister of that Kerim Khakimolf, who during his earlier term of service in Jedda was considered to be very active and very anti-British. The situation in Europe has perhaps damped Soviet enthusiasm for anti-British activities in the East, and Soviet trade interests in the Hejaz have greatly diminished. Indeed, in a con versation which he had with His Majesty’s Minister towards the end of the year, M. Khakimoff said that Soviet Russia was doing no business with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen and would do none. Fortunately, he added, such small markets were of little interest to a country with such a large turnover as Soviet Russia. It is known that M. Khakimoff is trying, with little prospect of success, to collect a sum of about £30,000 which the Saudi Government owe for Soviet oil products supplied in 1930. Although it has little to do the Soviet Legation had again acquired two secretaries before the end of the year, one a Kirghiz, the other a Jew. (6) Belgium. 101. There is still no sign that the appointment of Colonel Ibrahim Depui as honorary consul has made any difference to the relations, whether political or commercial, between Belgium and Saudi Arabia. Colonel Depui returned towards the end of January, having been away for nearly eleven months, but he stayed only two months, and since his departure the honorary consul for Czechoslovakia has been acting for him. Colonel Depui, who is a foolish and boastful adventurer with an unpleasant reputation among official Frenchmen in the Near East, and who arrogates to himself the title of c ‘ sharif,” which can only properly be borne by descendants of the Prophet’s elder grandson, would be a bad representative for a Government that had important interests in Saudi Arabia, but Belgian interests are not important. (7) Egypt. 102. The conclusion of the Saudi-Egyptian Treaty and the establishment of normal relations between the two countries are commonly attributed to the death of King Fuad, whose personal hostility to the recognition of Saudi Arabia was well known; but, as a matter of fact, relations had been improving for some time. It was, in fact, early in April (King Fuad died on the 28th April) that Fuad Bey informed Sir Andrew Ryan that, as the result of an exchange of telegrams between Cairo and Mecca, negotiations for a settlement of all outstanding questions were about to begin, and it appears that the foundation of the settle ment of the religious issues was laid with the full approval of King Fuad. However that may be, the negotiations once begun soon resulted in an agreement, and a treaty was signed by Fuad Bey and the Egyptian Prime Minister on the 7th May, and instruments of ratification were exchanged the following day. The parties very sensibly left for subsequent discussion the difficult question of the Mahmal (the sacred caravan) and several matters of smaller importance. The most important articles of the treaty are as follows : By article 1 the Egyptian Government recognise Saudi Arabia as a free, fully independent, sovereign State.32 4* By article 3 the parties agree to the exchange of diplomatic and consular repre sentatives. Under article 5 the Saudi Government agree to the repair of the mosques at Mecca and Medina by the Egyptian Government and to their undertaking other works in the interest of pilgrims, including road construction, the lighting of mosques, and the provision of water. By article 6 the parties agree to negotiate as soon as possible a settlement of outstanding questions and the conclusion of customs, postal and shipping agreements and the settlement of other matters of common interest. 103. The improvement in the relations between the two countries was such that Ibn Saud sent two telegrams to King Faruk condoling with him on his father’s death and congratulating him on his accession to the throne, and received suitable replies. As these telegrams were not published in the Mecca press until the 14th May, i.e., over a fortnight after King Fuad’s death, and then appeared without dates, it is to be assumed that Ibn Saud’s telegrams were not despatched until after the treaty had been signed. However, they are interesting as the first direct messages exchanged, so far as is known, between the rulers of the two countries since the Saudi conquest of the Hejaz. Id4. On the 25th August Sheikh Fauzan-al-Sabiq, who had been the unofficial Saudi representative in Cairo since 1924, was appointed Saudi Chargd d’Affaires in Egypt and Saudi consul-general in Cairo. An Egyptian decree, dated the 12th August, appointed Abdul Rahman Azzam Egyptian Minister to Saudi Arabia in addition to his duties as Minister to Iran and Iraq. 105. The signature of the treaty gave great satisfaction to Ibn Saud and to the Hejaz in general, and that satisfaction was increased by the conclusion on the 18th November, by means of an exchange of notes between Fuad Bey and Nahas Pasha, of a series of agreements dealing with some of the points left over for settlement under article 6 of the treaty of the 7th May. The notes were as follows :— (1) Notes providing for the resumption, with effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage, of the despatch of the Mahmal and the Kiswa (the ‘ ‘ Holy Carpet ” or covering of the Mecca shrine). (2) Notes providing for the resumption, with effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage, of the distribution of alms to the poor of the Hejaz and of the distribution in the Hejaz of the surplus of the waqfs of the two Holy Places. (3) Notes establishing a reciprocal arrangement whereby Egyptians in Saudi Arabia and Saudi subjects in Egypt would have the right to opt for Saudi or Egyptian nationality within six months from the date of the signature of the letters. (4) A note from Fuad Bey to Nahas Pasha assuring him that the tariff of pilgrim dues and charges will be published, and communicated by the Saudi Government to the Government of Egypt, every year before the beginning of the pilgrim season. 106. On the whole, the result of the negotiations in 1936 represented a victory for Ibn Saud. He is officially recognised by Egypt; the Mahmal is only to come as far as Jedda; the embroidery of the Kiswa is to contain the phrase : “ Presented to the Holy Kaba in the reign of His Majesty King Abdul Aziz-al-Saud, King of the Saudi Arab Kingdom under the treaty Egypt will spend money not only on the repair of the mosques at Mecca and Medina, but also on improvements which are primarily for the benefit of pilgrims, e.g., provision of water and construction of roads, but will also benefit the country as a whole and will, in any case, relieve the Saudi Government of the choice between spending money they can ill afford and leaving the Hejaz in a state which exposes them to criticism from pilgrims who come from lands which are better administered. The only important point on which the Saudi Government failed to get satisfaction was the recovery of the arrears of wakf receipts; the expenditure in and in favour of the Hejaz is to take effect from the forthcoming pilgrimage, so that, except for the grain and cash which was sent by the Egyptian Government in 1935 for the poor of Medina, Saudi Arabia has lost all benefit from the Egyptian wakfs for the oeriod since the Mahmal ceased to be33 sent. The population of the Hejaz are content to forget the past in the contem plation of the future. They are delighted at the prospect of the return of the golden flood of Egyptian charity to its ancient bed, and of the further profits to be made out of the Egyptian pilgrimage which the resumption of official relations and the signature of the treaty and the agreements are expected to stimulate. 107. For reasons best known to Nahas Pasha, Egypt stood outside the joint measures taken by the other Arab States in regard to the troubles in Palestine. 108. Now that normal relations have been established, it is to be expected that Saudi Arabia will be much influenced by Egypt, which, besides being near, is much more highly developed in education, in administration, and in commerce and industry. The Saudi Government have indented on the Government of Egypt for three schoolmasters and a road engineer. The schemes of Talat Pasha Harb belong rather to the economic section of this report. Most of them remain as schemes, but he has certainly stimulated the pilgrimage from Egypt both by sea and by air. One aeroplane even carried some pilgrims to Medina in 1936. (8) Turkey. 109. Ibn Saud regards Turkey with feelings of apprehension, which he has expressed to His Majesty’s Government on more than one occasion. His fears are not immediately for his own country, which is on quite good terms with Turkey, but for the Arab countries which march with Turkey. His fears became more acute at the prospect of the conclusion of a non-aggression agreement between Turkey, Persia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and probably formed one of the motives, though a less important one than his doubts about the intentions of Italy, which underlay his proposals to the Iraq Government for the conclusion of a treaty of alliance. Turkey has hardly any interests in Saudi Arabia, now that she discourages the pilgrimage, except the defence of the claims of Turkish subjects who own real property in the Hejaz. The new Turkish Charge d’Affaires, M. Palsay, who arrived in October, is only required by his Government to spend four months of the year in Saudi Arabia; the rest of the year he will either be in the Yemen or on leave. Towards the end of the year M. Palsay was active in distributing official Turkish propaganda about Alexandretta, a question which was giving the Saudi Government much anxiety. In private, M. Palsay, as a sincere Moslem, was having difficulty in defending the Turkish Government from accusations of impiety, and even infidelity, based upon its attitude towards the Moslem religion. The Hejaz must feel acutely the reduction to insignificant proportions of the numbers of'pilgrims from Turkey and must resent the official policy to which that reduction is due. (9) Iran. 110. The non-aggression agreement to which Iran is expected to be a party is mentioned in paragraph 109 above as a cause of apprehension to the Saudi Government. The Iranian Mamster in Cairo, Mr. Soltan Ahmad Khan Pad, was duly appointed to Saudi Arabia as well, but lie spent less than two months in the country, and it is understood that most of his time will be spent in Cairo. The fact that for more than ten months of the year Iranian interests were in the charge of a clerk and that there was no Legation building, the archives being stored at the Turkish Legation, is a measure of the degree of importance attached to Saudi Arabia by the Iranian Government, who are believed to regard the performance of the pilgrimage to IVlecca by Persians as a financial loss to the State which is to be discouraged. Ill The conclusion of the agreement about transit dues at Bahrein, which was concluded in November 1935, drew from the Iranian Government a protest addressed to the Saudi Government, setting forth the Iranian claim to Bahrein. The Saudi Government communicated the text of the protest to His Majesty’s Legation and asked for the views of His Majesty’s Govern ment on the draft reply which they had prepared. Sheikh Yusuf Yasm told His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires on this occasion that he regarded the claim34 - as a joke. His Majesty’s Government found no reason to object to the proposed reply, and it was presumably sent to the Iranian Government in that form. It was to the eftect that the Saudi Government had no knowledge of any Iranian i ights in Bahrein, and that, on the contrary, Bahrein used to belong to the ancestors of Ibn baud, though the Saudi Government had, nevertheless, recognised Sheikh Hamad-bin-Isa as Amir of the Bahrein Amirate. On the 30th May the Iranian Minister in London asked at the Foreign Othce whether he might have some information about the projected visit of the •vu ' l^ a h re i n to the United Kingdom. He had heard suggestions that it might be connected with recent proposals for a tightening up of relations between Arab States. He was assured that the visit had no political significance. The Minister then made tentative enquiries about the Saudi-Iraq Treaty with reterence to the idea of Arab unity. He was told that so far as His Majesty’s Government could see the treaty was a perfectly innocent one which called for no comment. It had nothing whatever to do with States under British protection. (1U) Afghanistan. at- - 1 ! 3 ' • Th ? re 1 is 1 little 1 l 0 record except a foolish dispute in which the Afghan \l nV o Ve i him f lf by takin S a house in Taif without first finding out whether the Saudi authorities would allow him to live at Taif at all. When he came to take up his tenancy he found the premises occupied by a relative of the Amir leisal, who had probably been housed there with provocative intent This may have been done in revenge for some too plain speaking which the Minister had used in various written complaints about the treatment to which Afghan pilgums were alleged to have been subjected in this country. The Minister went on leave, nominally with the intention to return in the autumn, but lie had not returned by the end of the year. i von 11 12 13 14 ',! 0 T he “umber of Afghan pilgrims in 1936 was 1,498, as against 1,707 i’f 2 n an pu’ 412 , !£ A 6 three P re y ous years. It is interesting to record that the fghan Charge d Affaires considers that the process of modernisation which is being pursued, though more slowly than in King Amanullah’s time in Afghanistan, is already tending to discourage Afghans from making the pilgrimage, and is expected to have an ever-growing effect in this direction” (11) Czechoslovakia. the lU'lvJk 6 ^U 601 mentio f d “ Paragraph 113 last year was realised, and on the 1st March the opening of a Czechoslovak consulate in Jedda and his own appointment as consul (honorary) was announced by M.

JNothmg more has been heard of the alleged intention of the Japanese Government, which was mentioned first in paragraph 103 of the report for 1934 to appoint a consul m Jedda. From Netherlands sources it is learned that the Japanese show an obvious desire to have a share in the pilgrim trade from the Netherlands East Indies, but they have not in fact begun to compete with existing lines. No Japanese were heard of as making the pilgrimage in 1936. (13) Ethiopia. 117. No action was taken to implement the informal as it was, which is mentioned in paragraph 109 of the 1935 agreement, colourless report, and Ethiopiaceased to have any significance for Saudi Arabia, except as a part of the problem of her relations with Italy. (14) The United States. 118. Mr. Twitchell’s appeal to the State Department to appoint an American consul at Jedda bore no fruit in 1936, but it may be mentioned here that an American consul-general from Egypt paid a visit to Jedda in January 1937 to ascertain the extent of United States interests in Saudi Arabia. (C) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 119. The attitude adopted by Saudi Arabia towards sanctions is described fully in the section on relations with Italy (paragraph 83). The Saudi Govern ment declared that they found themselves compelled ‘ ‘ to observe strict neutrality in the Italo-Ethiopian conflict unless special measures should be adopted granting to States non-members of the League the same rights and privileges as those accorded to member States.” At about the same time there was further discussion between Fuad Bey and Sir Andrew Ryan about the possibility of Saudi Arabia joining the League of Nations, but, like previous conversations on that subject, it was exploratory, and non-committal on both sides. A tentative enquiry on the subject by Sir Andrew Ryan two months later met with a guarded response from Fuad Bey, and since then the subject has not been referred to by either side. The fate of Ethiopia, a member of the League, may well have caused Ibn Saud to wonder whether it was worth while joining an organisation which appeared to be powerless against the very State which he seems to fear most. 120. The Saudi Government continue to regard with the greatest suspicion and hostility the international sanitary measures which are provided for in the Paris Convention of 1926 as a protection against possible danger from the pilgrimage. In January they sent to the International Sanitary Office in Paris a communication setting forth their objections to those articles of the convention about which they had made reserves as being unnecessary, a hindrance to pilgrims, harmful to the economic interests of Saudi Arabia, and unwarrantable inter ference in Islamic religious affairs. The Egyptian Quarantine Board recorded their polite recognition of the efforts made by the Saudi Government to improve the hygienic conditions of Saudi Arabia, but insisted on the inadequacy of the Saudi health reports, and stated their conviction that the Saudi Arabian Kingdom, in spite of its adherence to the Rome Convention of 1907, must be regarded from the sanitary point of view as a closed country. According to a report in a Damascus newspaper, the Saudi Director-General of Public Health obtained some success with the Office international d’Hygiene publique in Paris, and persuaded them to accept his view that the pilgrim quarantine stations outside the Hejaz were no longer necessary; but His Majesty’s Legation assume that this report is incorrect. 121. One or two encouraging signs of readiness to recognise international obligations were noticed in 1936. The Saudi Government agreed immediately, in principle, to meet claims arising out of the loss of two mail bags which had been delivered to the postal authorities in Hudaida during the Saudi occupation the previous year, and they gave facilities to Mr. Maxwell Darling to carry out investigations into the problem of the desert locust and promised similar facilities for a second expedition which he proposes to make. They, however, show no desire to participate in international accords which do not affect their interests.122. P) Treaties. No. I 43 45 46 47 Place and With.

General Situation. 123. Ibn Saud showed no lack of energy, either mental or physical, throughout the year, except for a short period of indisposition in the summer, when he abandoned his shooting expeditions for a time. He had several major political questions to deal with, and he seems to have dealt with them personally and with vigour. He found time and energy to go to Koweit at the beginning of the year and to make a long tour of inspection in the north in the autumn. Efforts seem to have been made to enhance the status of the heir apparent, e.g., by providing him with a separate palace in Jedda when he came here with his father after the pilgrimage. Tales of discords in the family harmony are frequently heard, but little reliance can be placed on most of them. It seems certain that when the King and the Amir Saud married the two grand-daughters of Nuri Shalan of Syria, and the Amir got the plain one when he expected the beauty, he was annoyed, but the common oriental method of healing such wounds seems to have been adopted with success. The Amir Feisal is believed to be subject to some extent to the tyranny of his new mother-in-law, Nura, the King’s sister, but to have been rescued from that of his brother, the Amir Saud, by the orders of the37 King that whenever Feisal is in Riyadh, Sand is to consult him about Hejaz affairs and not to deal with them independently. This story suggests that Saud himself has a real place in the Administration. Feisal’s part in the work of Viceroy of the Hejaz is believed to be purely nominal. The Amir Baud s outlook on life has become much more modern since his tour in Europe; his wireless m Mecca blazes music abroad from a house opposite the Haram, and he has been known to view a private cinema show without any attempt at concealment; but if general report is to be believed, the specialist in all the forms of entertainment, without exception, that the Hejaz affords, is the Amir Feisal. 124. Public security continues to be Ibn Baud’s most striking success, to such an extent that the occurrence of a few burglaries in Jedda aroused the greatest surprise. The Transjordan authorities noticed that when some of the Transjordan tribes returned to their homes this year, they left their flocks and herds m the charge of herdsmen in the Wady Sirhan, so complete was the security there. It was noticed by the Political Agent at Koweit that when the King went on his northern tour in the autumn, he gave Hail a wide berth owing, he stated in letters to the Sheikh of Koweit, to “ the oppressive gatherings of people.” He, however, contracted yet another alliance with the Rashid family by marrying a daughter of Muhammad-al-Tallal. The only discontent that has been heard of is that of the Hejazis, who complain that nearly all the revenue collected in the Hejaz is removed to Riyadh for “ overhead expenses,” and a grumble from Hasa against the burden of taxation. The prospecting parties sent out by the mining and oil enterprises are compelled by the Saudi authorities to take with them a Saudi escort of about ten men each, but it is believed that the escorts might be smaller without risk, and that the number has been fixed with an eye to the considerable sum in gold which the companies pay to the authorities for the escorts in addition to the dollars and food given to the men themselves. No estimate can yet be made of the effect of the Arms Regulation which was mentioned in paragraph 204 of the 1935 report. Some excitement, and hesitation about handing over arms, was heard of in the northern towns, but this was a year ago and no more has been heard about it. The order against the wearing of swords and daggers in the cities is effective in Jedda to such an extent that when a sword was wanted by a European for a fancy dress party, it was with some difficulty that a person could be found who would admit that he owned one. 125. The policy of conciliating former malcontents was continued. Two of the Hejazis who returned under the amnesty were made members of the Legislative Council, and a third, Director of Education. This policy has its disadvantages in that Hejazis who did not intrigue against Ibn Saud are annoyed at the favour shown to those who did, so that jealousy of some of their own people is added to jealousy of the Nejdis. Ibn Saud made an even bolder experiment in appointing one returned malcontent, Sheikh Khalid-bin-Hithlain of the Ajman, as Governor of the Ajman desert, and marrying his sister. Most of the tribal elements who had fled the country had taken advantage of the amnesty by the end of the year, but one group, as has been recorded elsewhere, seems to have decided to stay in Iraq for the present owing to the increase in the allowances from the King of Iraq. 126. Tales of poverty in the interior are common, but it is difficult to decide whether this poverty is new or merely becoming better known through the frequent journeys of mining and oil prospectors in parts or Arabia never before visited by Europeans. And in normal circumstances the nomad Arab lives sparely and is often half starved. Nevertheless, it seems certain that the camel transport trade has been badly hit by the competition of motor transport; and the people in Jedda and Mecca do not make as much profit out of the pilgrims as they did. On the other hand, the Cot-of-Gold mine is employing several hundred men and helping to reduce poverty in Mecca, and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company has a large wage bill for native labour on the other side of the country. Hopes are built on the extension of these industrial enterprises, and also on an increase in the number of pilgrims, now that the world crisis seems to be passing, while the poor of Medina are to benefit again from the Egyptian wakf funds. 127. The taboo on music has quite ceased to operate. Wireless is in common use, not only in Jedda, but in provincial towns and even in Mecca. Ibn Saud is known to listen with pleasure to the broadcasts of the singing of Egyptian womensingers, and he even allowed music to be played by troops near the Haram in Mecca o t ie scandal ol certain Indian pilgrims. Drum bands for the army and the police are under vigorous training, and brass instruments for the creation of several mi itary bands are being obtained from abroad. Some Wahabi tenets, however, aie unanected by the spirit of modernism. Finding that visits to the tomb of an alleged saint m Jedda, which had been discontinued after the Wahabi occupation were being resumed, the authorities had the body exhumed and buried in an 01 ( mary cemetery and the building which had contained the tomb demolished. _ oreover, a wealthy Indian pilgrim who offered to subscribe a large sum towards the construction of a mosque on the site of the birthplace of the Prophet, so that the ground, on which there stood a building until the Wahabis destroyed it, might not be defiled by animals, could make no impression on Ibn Saud, who said o\\ever hat the Government, though they could not allow a mosque to be built w rj lte ’ . mten 5 led to kmld a library there. An amusing manifestation of the Wahabi point of view was noticed in the exequatur granted to the honorary -Belgian consul an Islamised Frenchman, Colonel “Ibrahim” Depui This absurd person has taken the title of “ sharif,” and claims to be a descendant of le rop et, and the exequatur, as published in the Mecca press, takes him at his reason is that the Wahabi holds that the descendants of caded^shariT” n ° better ^ ° ther Moslems ’ and do not car€ if a d °g is Constitutional Develo'pment and A dministration. 128 What was rightly described in the 1934 report as the unpractical proposal to provide a Constitution for the whole of Saudi Arabia has not been dropped. It was announced m August that a draft Constitution for the Kingdom ot Saudi Arabia, m 140 articles, had been prepared by the Legislative Council and submitted to higher authority for sanction. No information as to the reception it received from higher authority had become public by the end of the year nor had any details of the proposals leaked out. Long lists of the measures dealt with by the Legislative Council during the preceding and the current Moslem years have appeared in the press. They have a wide range—education public health, pilgrimage affairs, nationality, the supervision of municipal and other local budgets, but it can be assumed that their work is closely controlled and that nothing is passed unless it has been ascertained beforehand that its acceptance will be pleasing to the King. 129. The announcement in the Mecca press that Sheikh Ibrahim Aziz-bin- Ibrahim, formerly Deputy Amir of Medina, had been appointed a member of the standing committee of the Council of Ministers, drew attention to a body whose existence had hardly been heard of. There are only two other members, Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, who holds the portfolios of Defence and Finance, and Fuad Bey Hamza, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Majesty’s Minister gathers from Fuad Bey that the committee has no well-defined duties and hardly ever meets. J 130. Sir Andrew Ryan reported two points of interest in connexion with the constitutional development of the country. The first was what appeared to be a departure from the system of two-year sessions for the Legislative Council. The Council, which had ended its regular session on the last day of the Moslem year 1354 (23rd March), was reconstituted with effect from the 24th March by a decree prescribing that the new session should last for one year. The second development was more important. In a speech on the opening of the new session, the King said that he had ordered the preparation of a regulation providing for an annual meeting of representatives of every district in the kingdom at pilgrimage time, in order to strengthen the bonds between the people^and the Government. When speaking in the Legislative Council on the address of reply to His Majesty, the Amir Feisal said that the proposed Assembly would meet for one month on the occasion of each pilgrimage, and he justified the shortness ol the session by the inconvenience to the representatives and the cost to the Government which a longer period would involve. He added, however, that at the end of each session a permanent body would be set up (a Standing Committee m fact) to consider the views expressed by the Assembly. Whether the regulation39 intended to give effect to this proposal was discussed by the Legislative Council is not known; it was certainly not published. There is little reason to expect that the proposed assembly would have any greater significance than the abortive “National Conference’’ composed of representatives of the Hejaz towns only, which met in 1931 but never again. This new-fangled assembly business was evidently not intended to replace entirely the simpler paternal form of consulta tion sanctioned by ancient Arab usage, for only a month later the King made a speech, saying that he wished to meet the people so that he might he aware of their ideas and wishes, and they of his, and that the public would therefore have free access to him, and, in his absence from the Hejaz, to his son, the Viceroy, from 8 to 9 o’clock every evening. 131. The ordinary difficulties of administration are aggravated in a country like this, where there is no supply of trained officials, where any man may be raised suddenly from nothing by the King and as suddenly degraded, and where, while it is a point of honour with the King to make lavish presents to any sheikh, Saudi or not, who visits him, officials are always in arrear with their pay—some times as much as six months. Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman continues to be the most important man in the Administration, being in charge of finance, defence and the pilgrimage. His influence was able to restore to favour his brother and assistant, who had been disgraced after a dispute with the King’s Chamberlain. New stars show above the horizon now and then, such as Najib Salha, a clever young Syrian who was a clerk in the office of a British firm in Jedda two or three years ago and is now Director of Public Works in Jedda, and a certain Abdullah Khuwaitir, a Nejdi, who is a sort of Director of Supplies and is said to have laid the foundations of his career by the ingenious device of buying up cheap the robes which are given away at festivals by the King and are then sold by the recipients, and selling them back to the Treasury at a profit but still at a much lower price than the market rate. In spite of the appointment of a Hejazi to a post in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Syrians retained their predominance. Fuad Bey was absent for more than half the year, but the gap was filled as usual, when there were negotiations to be carried out, by his fellow Syrian, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin. At other times current affairs were delegated first to Sheikh Abdullah Sulaiman, and when he left, to his brother, Hamad, who even received the credentials of the new Turkish Charge d’Affaires. Some of the administrative changes on the Transjordan frontier have been alluded to elsewhere. One satisfactory change was the removal of a truculent frontier customs official, Muhammad Farhud, to the post of chief of police at a place some 60 miles south of Jauf. IV.— Military and Naval Organisation. 132. An attempt is being made to organise in the Hejaz a regular armed force, more akin perhaps to a gendarmerie than to an army. These troops wear European uniforms, are drilled to some extent, and, although they cannot yet be described as soldierly, their appearance on the march is considerably less disreputable than it was. Their military value, however, is probably rather less than that of the only other standing forces in the country, namely, the personal retainers and negro guards of the King and the Amirs. In case of war Ibn Baud would no doubt rely, as in the past, on levies from the tribes and villages. It would appear that the Ikhwan can no longer be considered the backbone of his forces, while the irregular camelry in the Hejaz has been absorbed into the regular army. 133. There is a military school at Mecca which was intended for the training of about 100 cadets at a time, but at present it is being used exclusively for training recruits to the ranks. 134. The barracks throughout the kingdom are, it is said, to be repaired, and some work was, in fact, carried out at Jedda during the early autumn. It has been reported from Transjordan that the Saudi Arab Government intend to build desert forts on the Saudi-Transjordan frontier at Haql, Alaqan, Dhat-al- Haj, Isawiya and Haditha, and on the Saudi-Iraqi frontier at Lanqa, Lina, Umm-al-Rudhumma, Hafar-al-Batan and Jeriya. These forts are to be opposite40 Iraqi or Transjordan posts, and those at Lanqa, Lina and Hafar-al-Batan aie stated to be of stone, nearly completed, and larger than the corresponding posts across the frontiers. 135. The corps of officers remained as heterogeneous and as disorganised as ever. It numbers Turks, Egyptians, Syrians and a Javanese among its membeis. Muhammad-bin-Sultan, almost the only officer not of foreign origin who was formerly commander of camelry in the Hejaz, has been little heard 01 since its absorption into the regular forces. 136. Saudi Arabia possesses nothing which can be termed a navy, but the Government have recently laid down two large dhows which, it is supposed, will be used for coast patrols. The Saudi Minister in London was among the representatives of States, not members of the League of Nations, to whom the recent London Naval Treaty was communicated, and the Saudi Arab Government have been invited to accede to the rules governing the action of submarines with regard to merchant ships in time of war, contained in the 'proces-verbal signed at London on the 6th November, 1936. No reply to this invitation had been received by the end of the year. V.— Aviation and Connected Matters. Saudi A ir Force. 137. The year under review has seen considerable aerial activity in this country. For this the chief credit must be given to the Italian Government. 138. Eight of the students who were sent to Italy in 1935 for training in aviation returned to Jedda on the 4th April and the other two on the 31st May. These “eagles,” as they were nicknamed by the local press, received a rousing welcome on arrival, but soon found that their pay was not to be commensurate with their prestige, being, in fact, about equal to that of chauffeurs. For a short period they were in some sort propagandists for Italy and her aviation, but any effect they may have had was soon dispelled by their lack of skill. They proved incapable of flying a French aeroplane of a make to which they were not accustomed, and it soon appeared that, although they had been taught to manage the controls of an aeroplane, they knew nothing about the works. Their solitary triumph was when some of their number flew over Mecca, the first, according to Moslem tradition, since Muhammad and his steed Buraq, and their arrogance and ostentation, added to their inefficiency, soon alienated public sympathy. Their commanding officer, the chief of the Jedda garrison, made it plain in a conversation at the end of the summer that his £ £ eagles ’ ’ had turned out to be the merest landrails. 139. The small success of their first foreign-trained pilots may have shaken the Saudi Arab Government’s resolve to have students trained abroad. It is true that soon after his arrival His Majesty’s Minister was asked by the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs whether His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to train in England ten to fifteen Saudi aviation students annually, and, if so, what would be the cost and the facilities which would be extended to them, but the request was conveyed in a personal letter, and it is doubtful whether the enquiry had the approval of the King. It is one thing to resist Italian proposals that more Saudi pilots should be trained in Italy, as Ibn Saud seems to have done, but quite another to turn immediately to His Majesty’s Government for such facilities. A non-committal reply was returned to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s enquiry, and the question was still under consideration at the end of the year, when there were signs that a policy of training pilots in Jedda had been decided upon, with one Italian pilot and one Russian as instructors. 140. Not content with providing instruction for the “eagles,” either free or at a low cost, the Italian Government offered Saudi Arabia six aeroplanes. They were accepted, the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir Andrew Ryan, in accordance with the Saudi policy of preserving an appearance of friendship with Italy. Three instructional biplanes of unknown make were landed from an Italian steamer on the 29th May and assembled by Italian mechanics. For a time they were flown regularly by some of the Saudi pilots under the supervision of an Italian instructor, but one was wrecked andthe other two were for some months rarely used. It is necessary to add. however, that these two machines began to be used fairly regularly for training purposes in January 1937. On the 4th November a fourth aeroplane—a three-engined “ Caproni ” D.C. 101 eight-seater monoplane—arrived. This machine is stated to be easily convertible into a bomber, to have a range of 930 miles and a speed of 174 miles an hour, and to be able to carry 1,100 lb. of bombs and four guns. With the “ Caproni ” was supplied a hangar for some fifteen to twenty aero planes. At the end of the year this was being erected at Jedda under the supervision of Italian engineers. It is understood that the Saudi Arab Government are paying £2.000 for this hangar, which is much less than the cost price. 141. In addition to the Italian aeroplanes, the Saudi Arab Government have a Caudron Renault “ Pelican ” monoplane, which arrived on the 25th March as a present to the King from the French Government, and three “ Wapitis purchased under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government in 1929-30. The “ White ” Russian pilot who, with his Russian mechanic, constitutes the only properly trained aviation personnel in the employ of the Saudi Government, informed His Majesty’s Minister that these machines were in excellent order and “ good for another five years,” but could not be flown, as the Italians had made their assistance conditional upon the exclusive use of Italian machines. If such a condition was ever laid down (and the facts supported for some time the belief that it had been), it was being disregarded in January 1937. 142. The Arab Aviation Society showed considerable activity, and by the end of the year was stated to have collected some £2,370 gold for the purchase of aeroplanes to be named Mecca, Medina, Riyadh and Jedda, after the chief towns in the kingdom. The machines, however, have not yet appeared. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs sounded the Air Officer Commanding, Middle East, as to the possible purchase of English aircraft by his Government, but the Saudi Government did not follow this enquiry up. 143. The main base of the air force is still at Taif, where it is proposed to use a more suitable landing ground some 18 kilom. from the town, and plans for building aerodromes at Muwaih, Dawadami and Riyadh have also been mentioned. The King has handed over his villa at Kandara, outside Jedda, to the aviation authorities, and a landing ground, a square kilometre in area, on which the Italians are erecting the new hangar, is being laid out in the vicinity. Other Aviation. 144. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate have imported a ” Bellanca ” four-seater monoplane and have made landing grounds at Jedda, Wejh, Yanbu and Dhiba. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have a machine operating in and about Hasa, while Petroleum Development (Western Aiabia) (Limited) wish to employ aircraft for prospecting purposes, but ha\e not jet reached an agreement on this point with the Saudi Arab Government. I he attitude of the Saudi Arab Government towards the arrival oi depaituie o foreigners by air is uncertain. This year a number of pilgrims wei e allowed to come to Jedda by air for the Haj, and an Egyptian pilgrim (as mentioned m the pilgrimage section) travelled by air from Jedda to Medina and thence to Egypt. Later, however, two English concession hunters failed to obtain permission to come to Jedda, or to leave, by air. Arabian Air Route. 145. See paragraph 68. Alleged Violations of Saudi Territory by Aeroplanes. 146 On the 21st January a Royal Air Force aeroplane was forced to land at Ras-al-Qalia, some 60 miles north-west of Bahrein. To forestall a protest the Legation sent a note of apology to the Saudi Government, who received it amiably. Similar action was taken in September, when two Royal Air Force machines had to land at Ras-al-Qalia. The Saudi Government protested against an alleged [15154] B 1342 violation of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier at Alqan by two Royal Air Force planes. On investigation, it appeared that no violation had, in fact, taken place. An allegation that a British machine from Transjordan had crossed into Saudi Aiabia near Haditha on the 22nd November was still being studied at the end of the year. ^l^hough it neither caused nor was alleged to have caused any wolation of Saudi territory, the forced landing on the mainland near Bahrein of the Imperial Airways machine Horsa may be mentioned here. On receipt of information tending to show that the machine had come down in Saudi territory, the usual note of apology was addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but ^ WaS l oca ^ e( ^ a point some 40 miles south of Salwa wells, a point ^ell within territory the subject of dispute between His Majesty’s Government n ^ au( ^‘ instructions from the Foreign Office, His Majesty’s Charge d Affaires orally informed the Saudi Arab Government of the approximate position of the aircraft, explained that steps were being taken to carry out the necessaiy lepairs, which would involve flights by the Imperial Airways and the Ro^al Aii 1 Force, and requested that any of Ibn Sand’s tribesmen likely to approach the spot should be warned of what was being done, to obviate the risk ol untoward incidents. 1 he Saudi Arab Government raised no objection and the Horsa, after undergoing repair, arrived at Bahrein on the 12th September. Subscriptions are being asked for aeroplanes for defence, and it is believed that the authorities also favour the use of aeroplanes for official journevs, for which in a country with no roads and its main administrative centres separated from each other by long stretches of sparsely populated country, they would be useful; but it is doubtful whether Saudi Arabia is capable of establishing and maintaining an air force even for civil purposes. Such a force would i equiie elements not to be found in Saudi Arabia. It would be even more difficult to train Saudi candidates as aeroplane mechanics than it has proved to produce the “ eagle ” pilots, and most difficult of all to keep pilots and mechanics up to the minimum standard in a country where pay is low and always heavily in arrears, where there is no homogeneous body of public servants to maintain the dignity and zeal of its members, and where almost the highest authorities have to be appealed to for the issue of oil and petrol for a series of fliohts, or even sometimes for a single flight. VI.— Press. 149. The two Mecca weeklies, the Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-al-Hejaz, continued to be the only newspapers, with the possible exception of periodicals of purely religious interest, appearing in Saudi Arabia. The editor of the Saut-al-Hejaz stated on one occasion that, as the circulation of his paper was only 1,600 copies, of which 600 to 700 are sold in Mecca and 100 to 200 in Jedda, while a good many aie distributed free, it owes its existence to the Government’s financial aid and therefore dare not publish anything displeasing to it The same is no doubt true of the Umm-al-Qura. But in any case, what activity in Saudi Arabia is free from Ibn Sand’s control that the press should escape it? The Saut-al-Hejaz is produced by the “Arab Press and Publications Company (Limited).” This company, which is reported to have a capital of 22,000 Saudi piasties, half paid up, published its first report on the 28th April, showin°’ a handsome profit, but the shareholders, who include Sheikh Yusuf ’ Yasin, the King s secretary, weie asked to pay up the other half of the capital. A new issue was to be made with the object of buying a new printing press. 150. J hanks to the close control under which they work, the newspapers published nothing but colourless news about the Italo-Ethiopian war. Even the troubles in Palestine drew no reference, except lists of subscriptions for the sufferers, until the disorders were called off, when they said just enough to show wheie then sympathies lay. Two items taken from the propaganda newspapers distributed by the Italian Legation were noticed in one issue of the Saut-al-Hejaz but they contained nothing but Italian self-glorification; they did not attack Great Britain. 151. Both newspapers contain up-to-date news from foreign countries. These are taken from the various wireless broadcasts, including those of the B.B.C., in spite of the “ world copyright reserved by Reuter.”43 VII.— Legislation. 152. The following paragraphs describe briefly the only important legis lation of a general nature enacted during the year and not fully dealt with elsewhere in this report:— Merchant Shipping .—By a decree of the 8th May, shipping agents are forbidden to issue tickets to would-be passengers unless the applicant produces a valid passport. The penalty for the first offence is to be a fine of not less than £50 gold or more than £100 gold, and is to be double in case of recidivism. This merely amends article 10 of the regulations promulgated in 1932. 153. The Effects of Deceased Pilgrims .—A decree of the 25th October lays down that, if a pilgrim wishes to change the executor whose name is written in his pilgrim pass, he may do so and appoint whomsoever he will. Ihe appoint ment is to be considered valid after due proof in the Sharia court, which may be given after the death of the pilgrim. This decree supplements the regulations concerning the registration of deceased pilgrims’ effects issued in 1927. Sharia courts are indifferent to written evidence when oral testimony is available, so under this decree any designing Saudi can appear in the courts and claim, with some hope of success, to be the executor of a deceased British pilgrim in the face of the latter’s wishes recorded in writing on his pilgrim pass. His Majesty’s Legation view this decree with misgiving and will keep a close watch on its application. 154. Commerce .—By a decree of the 23rd March a licence must be obtained from the Ministry of Finance before tea and sugar may be imported into this country. The amount to be imported must be specified in the licence and a tax of 1 piastre miri paid on each kilogramme thereof. At first this seemed to institute some form of quota system, but the actual effect of the decree seems to be merely to impose an additional customs tax on tea and sugar. 155. Certain reductions in the customs dues, namely, those on artificial silk piece-goods, cement, timber (teak and deal), Egyptian rice, methylated spirits, hand towels, and various luxury articles, were introduced by a decree of the same date. It is a sign of the changing outlook of the Saudi Arab Government that they tolerate, and even encourage by reduced customs dues, the import of luxuries such as the true Wahhabi repudiates. 156 Narcotics .—The ratification by the Saudi Arab Government of the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs of 1931 was effected by a decree of the 7th August, which pointed out that the provisions of the convention not only accord with, but indeed fall short of, the provisions of the Sharia law on this subject, and mentioned the Saudi legislation enacted in 1934. VIII.— Education. 157. Schools have been established during the year at Mecca for training (1) orphans and cripples; (2) policemen; and (3) students who are to be sent abroad for higher education. It was reported in August that schools weie being founded in Riyadh, Hasa, Qatif, Jubeil, Majma, Shagra, Buraida, Eneyza and Hail, while provision has been made in the budget of the Depaitment ot Education for new preparatorv schools at Mecca, Jedda and Yanbu. At the request of the Saudi Arab Government, the Egyptian Ministry of Education has nominated three teachers to give instruction in the special school which is to prepare students for study abroad. 158. Considerable attention has been paid during the year to the teaching of English. The British and American oil and gold mining companies are obliged by the terms of their several concessions to employ Saudis whenever possible. Thus there is a demand for clerks having a knowledge of English and a corresponding demand among the young Saudis for instruction in that language. A committee of English teachers was set up in May under Jamil Daud, an otticial of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, to draw up a curriculum of English studies for primary schools, while a grant was made in the budget foi the opening, m t le spring of 1937, of a night school for English in Mecca.44 159. There has been a tendency on the part of the Saudi Arab Government to discourage teaching by private individuals not in possession of a licence from the Department of Education. The Legation intervened in favour of a British- protected person engaged in giving private lessons in English, and he was given a licence. IX.— Public Health. (F- 160. The Saudi Government continued to devote their attention to questions of public health, but with results incommensurate with the legislative energy and departmental activity reported from time to time in the press. The situation generally shows little improvement over that depicted in this section last year. Medical personnel and their qualifications, hospitals and their equipment and general sanitary conditions remained much as they were. Medical officers numbered eighteen, of whom one was Saudi and thirteen Syrian. All of them, with the exception of the Royal physician at Riyadh and a second doctor sent temporarily to Hasa (both of whom were engaged in Mecca during the Haj), were stationed in the Hejaz. 161. Work on the hospitals at Mecca and Jedda made slow progress, and the building of the hospital at Taif was entirely suspended. A new wing to the Mecca hospital was begun and named after the Amir Saud. The second X-ray apparatus (paragraph 211 of the 1935 report) arrived, but it was not installed, and no X-ray specialist was found to use it, though there was a reference in the press to the despatch of Saudi students to Egypt for training in X-ray work. 162. Efforts have been made in Jedda, and to a smaller extent in Mecca, to protect perishable food-stuffs, such as meat, milk, bread and vegetables, from contamination in the bazaars, and some improvement has been effected. The Indian medical officer reported that there was no improvement in general sanitary conditions at Muna and Arafat during the pilgrimage. 163. A National lirst-Aid Society, founded in 1935, made some progress. Branches were formed in Mecca and Medina and Royal support was enlisted. In Mecca a promising start was made in 1936, and premises, where certain essentials of equipment were installed, were secured in the Haram itself. Funds are derived from donations and from a special stamp duty of 1 piastre (reduced later in the year to J piastre) levied on letters sent through the Saudi post. Somewhat ambitious plans are stated to be entertained for the construction of hospitals at Mecca and Medina and the completion of the one under construction at Taif. 164. A deterioration in general health conditions was apparent immediately after the pilgrimage season. Amongst local inhabitants malignant malaria was prevalent, and about fifteen Sudanese pilgrims contracted small-pox coming from Medina. Of ten of the latter who were admitted to hospital on arrival at Jedda, nine died; those who did not enter the hospital recovered. In August reports were received of an epidemic of malaria in Asir and Najran, to deal with which all available doctors were ordered south. It is not known what success they had, but their prompt return was unkindly attributed in one report to fears for their own skins. Reports of plague in the same areas were not substantiated. Allusion has been made earlier in this report to the health bulletins which appear from time to time in the Mecca press. They are of little practical value and were described by the International Quarantine Board at Alexandria as “ irreguliers, impr6cis, discontinus et parfois absents.” 165. Europeans were not immune from sickness and the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate, disturbed at their heavy sick-list and the death of two employees, one British and one American, brought out an expert in tropical diseases from the Ross Institute, Colonel F. P. Mackie, C.S.I., I.M.S., to advise them. He arrived on the 11th October and returned to England a month later, after having spent two weeks in Jedda and the remainder of the time at the “ Cot-of-Gold ” mine and at Taif. He was well received by the Saudi health authorities, was shown hospitals and schools, and examined a number of school children. It is expected that he will make a report, but this had not been received at the end of the year.45 166. The municipal dispensary at Jedda was closed for most of the year and will remain so, but, as mentioned earlier, Government of India dispensaries worked more or less as usual. Other foreign medical missions were the Dutch, Egyptian and Afghan in Mecca and the Italian in Jedda. The attitude of the Saudi authorities to foreign dispensaries and their personnel has been referred to in paragraph 73. 167. Legislation included regulations governing the practice of dentistry and the ratification of the International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture, &amp;c., of Narcotic Drugs, signed at Geneva on the 13th July, 1931. X. —Pilgrimage. 168. The annual pilgrimage report, submitted to the Foreign Office on the 3rd August, contains full information concerning the 1936 pilgrimage, but a brief reference may be made to certain matters of general interest. 169. In spite of the vigorous Haj propaganda carried on in Moslem countries by the Saudi Government, there was a check in the gradual increase which had taken place over the three preceding years, in the number of overseas pilgrims. This is credibly attributed to the uncertainty created by the Italo- Ethiopian dispute. India, North Africa and Palestine were the countries particularly affected, but a decline of 4,188 from these countries was partly offset by an increase of 2,250 from certain other countries, notably West Africa, Dutch East Indies, Somaliland and the Sudan. The estimated figures for arrivals at Jedda, Yanbu and Lith are :— 1935. 1936. British and British administered— Indian 11,113 8,439 Malayan 617 906 West African 879 2,550 Sudanese 866 1,196 Palestinian 1,432 769 Dutch East Indian 3,992 4,540 Egyptian 5,361 5,724 Others, including minor British elements 9,337 8,299 Total 33,597 32,423 170 Five hundred Hejazis are included in the above total for 1936 and should be deducted in order to arrive at the total of foreign pilgrims arriving at Hejazi ports. An addition, however, should be made of 1,829 pilgrims (including 200 Indians) who travelled by the overland route, via Iraq, and returned the same way. 171. Pilgrimage Day, the 9th Dhu’l Hijja, fell on Tuesday, the 3rd March, 1936. The congregation on Arafat numbered some 60,000, which according to the Legation estimates was some 10,000 less than last year. Climatic conditions were excellent and the general health was good. 172. Distinguished foreign pilgrims were less numerous than in 1935, but included Princess Khadija Abbas Halim, sister of the late Khedive and widow of the late Abbas Halim Pasha; members of the Bahrein ruling family; Fawwaz Shalan; and a number of highly-placed Indian personages. 173. The visit of Princess Khadija Abbas Halim was notable as, although she arrived by sea, she travelled from Jedda to Medina and thence back to Egypt by air. 174. The conclusion of a treaty between Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the subsequent agreement regarding the Mahmal, Kiswa and wakfs, have been noticed earlier in this report. The following matters of pilgrimage interest were dealt with in the treaty : the repair of the mosques at Mecca and Medina; the lighting of the mosques; the improvement of the water supply and the construction of roads. The latter is a question of great importance to pilgrims, as considerable hardship was experienced on the Jedda^Mecca and Jedda-Medina roads, owing46 to the poor state of the roads themselves and defects in the supply and the con dition of motor transport. These unsatisfactory conditions were aggravated by heavy floods on the Medina road, in which eight British pilgrims lost their lives. At the end of the year an Egyptian road engineer had arrived under the auspices of the Banque Misr, and was reported to have begun work, in collaboration with a special Roads Commission appointed by the Saudi Government. 175. Ihe official pilgrim tariff for the 1937 Haj, which was published in the autumn, showed some small increases. The reduction of 25 per cent, on transport charges introduced the year before (see paragraph 222 of the 1935 report) was maintained, but a road tax, designed to provide funds for work of road construction was a new feature. At the end of 1936 pilgrims arriving for the oncoming Haj encountered difficulties in the Customs Department at Jedda, with the result that the Saudi authorities liberalised the customs regulations applicable to pilgrims. 1^6. The change imported into article 4 of the Treaty of Jedda, in respect of the disposal of the effects of deceased Indian pilgrims, has been mentioned at paragraph 153 above. 177- Little improvement can be recorded in the behaviour of mutawwifs, or guides, of whose conduct complaints have been numerous and sometimes serious. Ihe black list has been maintained, but, perhaps because of the close connexion between one of the principal offenders and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has met with increasing opposition from the Saudi authorities, who have shown a disposition to contest the right of the Legation to concern itself with British pilgrims in the Hejaz, as being in their view a relic of the capitulatory regime. 178 Strict rules were adopted early in 1936 to prevent occidentals pro fessing Islam from going to Mecca without satisfying the authorities that they had been practising Moslems for a stated period. These rules were modified by Ibn Saud himself, and it was proposed for the future to require such pilgrims to spend three months in Jedda under the tutelage of a religious committee An American woman was refused permission, but an Islamised Briton, a Hungarian and a Pole all performed the pilgrimage. 179. The number of destitutes from India unfortunately showed an increase during the 1936 pilgrimage season, no less than 617 out of 662 coming overland from Persian Gulf ports. Saudi measures, and measures taken in India by the authorities there, to restrict this movement may have had some success later in the year, for towards the end of 1936, hardly any destitutes had arrived in Mecca for the 1937 Haj. XI.— Slavery. 180. The main provisions of the Saudi Slavery Regulations, which were issued on the 2nd October, 1936 (see paragraph 59 above), are as follows : Article 1 prohibits the importation of slaves by sea; the importation by ^ an y slave, unless proof is produced that he was a slave in the country of export on the 2nd October, 1936; the enslavement of a free person in Saudi Arabia, and the acquisition, by purchase or otherwise, of any person covered by these prohibitions. Articles 2 and 3 are designed to ensure that slaves shall be properlv treated. r r j Articles 5 and 6 prohibit the separation of mothers from their minor children, and, subject to certain conditions, of husband and wife. Article 7 lays down the procedure by which a slave can purchase his freedom. Article 8 allows any freed slave who was not born in Saudi Arabia to choose his place of residence. Articles 9 and 10. All slaves to be registered within one year, and any slave not registered by then may demand a certificate of manumission Article 12. Only licensed agents and brokers may deal in slaves. Articles 13 and 14. Inspector of Slave Affairs and, if necessary, a deputy inspector, to be appointed. The registration authorities to furnish six-monthly reports.47 181. Over two months after the promulgation of the Slavery Regulations an official communique appeared in the Umm-al-Q.ura of the 11th December appointing the Director-General of Police at Mecca as Inspector of Slave Affairs and his assistant as Deputy Inspector, and declaring the police throughout the Saudi Arabian Kingdom to be the competent authorities for the registration of slaves. Whether registration had begun seriously by the end of the year is not known. 182. The falling off in the number of slaves taking refuge in the Legation, which was mentioned in paragraph 224 of the 1935 report, was continued in 1936, but it must be remembered that the figures given below are for nine months only, since the British right of manumission was renounced with effect from the 3rd October. On hand at the beginning of January : nil. Took refuge : seven males, six females. Manumitted and repatriated : two females. Manumitted locally : one male, one female. Left the Legation voluntarily after taking refuge : five males. On hand on the 3rd October : one male, three females. 183. The four slaves on hand on the 3rd October were protected by a reserve to which reference was made in the section on the Treaty of Jedda (paragraph 61). They eventually left the Legation to live in a neighbouring village under an arrangement which seemed likely to afford them full protection. 184. It is early yet to give an opinion about the effect which the Saudi Slavery Regulation is likely to have on slavery in this country. Some local reports represent slave owners as regarding the regulation as less to be feared than the possibility they formerly had to face that their servants would take refuge in the British Legation. 185. Less than a year hence any slave who has not been registered by his master will be entitled to demand a certificate of manumission (articles 9 and 10 of the regulation). It remains to be seen how many slaves will learn of this provision, act upon it, and secure the manumission which they demand. 186. As Italian control extends in Ethiopia, the main overseas source of supply of slaves for Arabia should be cut off. XII.— Naval Matters. 187. The following visits were paid to Jedda by British sloops during the year : H.M.S. Londonderry, the 1st to the 8th March, the 11th to the 14th June and the 14th to the 18th September; H.M.S. Weston, the 27th November to the 2nd December. 188. French sloops visited Jedda several times in the course of the year, viz., the D'Iberville, with Rear-Admiral Rivet commanding the Naval Division of the Levant, for a few hours on the 18th January; the Bougainville from the 11th to the 12th February; the D'Iberville from the 4th to the 8th March; the Bougainville from the 11th to the 17th April and again from the 2nd to the 3rd May; the D'Iberville from the 18th to the 22nd June and on the 3rd August. It was noticed during the April visit of the Bougainville, which is rather large for a sloop and carries an aeroplane, that the officers included one of apparently equal rank with the commander, viz., a “ chef de bataillon ” of colonial infantry. It seems probable that he was a special service officer, come to accompany the French Minister to the Yemen. No visits were made by warships of other Powers. It is noteworthy that Italy sent no vessel to show the flag at Jedda. 189. Mention may be made here of the interest taken in Tiran and Senafir Islands during the year. The conclusion was reached that Saudi Arabia alone had a good claim to them, and that it would be unwise to raise the question. Air reconnaissances disclosed no signs of unusual activity and were discontinued.48 A\hen H.M.S. Penzance visited the islands, the commanding officer reported that, although their value as a potential naval base was extremely doubtful, a good landing ground for aircraft existed on Senafir Island. There were rumours of an Italian attempt to purchase, or obtain a concession over, Tiran, but interest in su bsided by the end of the year. It was, however, agreed between the departments concerned that the islands should be visited occasionally by His ^ Majesty’s ships without prior notification to either the Egyptian or Saudi Governments. 190. Visits to Jedda continued to be made by bare notification to the Saudi Government, without any request for permission. No other Saudi ports were visited. XIII.— Miscellaneous. The Death of His Late Majesty King George. 191. Ihe universal sorrow caused by the death of His late Majesty King George was generally shared in Jedda. Among the expressions of sympathy iecerved were many from Indians both in Mecca and Jedda No religious service could be held, but most of the Legation staff, some members of the European British community and the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires gathered at the Legation on the 28th January to hear the funeral service. The references in the press to the abdication of His Majesty King Edward VIII were so discreet as to be almost unintelligible. General Position of Foreign Subjects. British subjects continue to be treated with consideration. A European Hutch subject who knocked down a Saudi with his motor car, causing injuries which proved fatal was arrested and taken to the police station, but energetic representations by the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires secured his speedy release. 193. Apart from the usual spoliation and occasional ill-treatment of pilgrims, the position of British subjects and protected persons of non-European race gave little ground for complaint. That of Africans, indeed, improved owin- to the mci eased demand for unskilled labour in this country. included ^ 0n an( ^ non-Moslem visitors to Jedda during the year Colonel P. T.

Economic development is tending to bring an increasing number of Europeans and Americans to this country, and whereas in the palt they have been confined to Jedda there is now, owing to the activities of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate in the neighbouring districts, a quite considerable Americo- European colony at Wejh and another at the Cot-of-Gold Mine some 240 miles in Hasa^ 1 6 ^ ^Bfornia Arabian Standard Oil Company have a similar colony49 Bibliography and Cartography. 196.

It is believed that two more or less relevant works are in preparation, viz., a history of the Arabs, by Bertram Thomas, and a book of character sketches of T. E. Lawrence, by a number of people who knew him. Mr. Philby can be relied upon to produce both a book and a map descriptive of his journey to Shabwa, to which reference is made in paragraph 36 above.f/otf-i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office. CONFIDENTIAL. (14893) SAUDI ARABIA. Copy 'No. Annuiil Report, 1935. [E 1538/1538/23] Sir A. Ryan to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 21.) (No. 64.) Sir, Jedda, February 29, 1936. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith my annual report on Saudi Arabia for 1935. It has been necessary to devote a good deal of space to the relations of this country with Great Britain and Italy, and I have thought it desirable, in view of recent developments, to devote special attention to the relations between Ibn Saud and his neighbours on the north-east and east. I have included a short new section on public health. 2. The members of my staff have helped me greatly in the compilation of the report. In particular, Mr. A. S. Calvert has contributed a portion of Section IV, and his reports during my absence have been of even greater value than usual, as he had the handling of important and difficult questions during the autumn. It is largely due to the energy of my outer Chancery staff that I am able to despatch the report earlier than usual. Mr. W. J. Nimmo has done the whole of the typing in a short space of time, with assistance in the way of dictation from Mr. R. V. Hall. 3. I should like also to acknowledge my indebtedness on this and previous occasions to the authors of the various intelligence reports forwarded to me by the British authorities in the surrounding countries. I have been asked privately whether I saw any objection to the inclusion of information about Saudi Arabia in certain of these reports. Such is very far from being the case.

ON the whole the year 1935 passed smoothly in Saudi Arabia. The internal situation seemed to be good throughout the year, although problems of tribal administration in the east may possibly have been more difficult than usual, and there were reports of trouble in the high mountains of Asir and in Najran. If these reports were true, the incidents did not, as some feared, breed fresh trouble with the Yemen. In general the foreign relations of Saudi Arabia suffered no undue strain, in spite of the continuance of the protracted, but not acute, controversy with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom over Ibn Saud’s eastern and south-eastern frontiers and the repercussions in the latter part of the year of the Italo-Ethiopian situation. Peace prevailed on the northern frontiers. 2. There was no further appearance of that weakening at the centre of things, which was spoken of in the introduction to the report for 1934. The King showed, if anything, fewer signs of lethargy and loss of grip on his machine. There were also fewer open signs of acute dissension in his family or his entourage as a whole. His Majesty continued to devote much time to sport, and his normal mood seemed to be one of genial enjoyment of life. The influence of Wahhabism continued to decline. A competent British observer who crossed Arabia in the summer pronounced Wahhabism to be dying or dead. This is certainly an exaggeration, but the modernists have scored many points in the struggle with religious fanaticism. The sporadic attempts of the exponents of the latter to regain ground, e.g., by reinvigorating the Committees of Virtue in Mecca and Jedda, have been short-lived. 3. Ibn Saud felt secure enough in January to proclaim a sort of amnesty in favour of persons previously excluded from his dominions for political reasons I his seemed unlikely to bring back many exiles, but by the end of the year a sufficient number of tribal and other personages had come back to show that little hope of undermnnng the present regime survived either among the expatriated tribal chiefs m Iraq or among those intriguers, mostly of Hejazi origin who were so busy three or four years ago in Egypt and elsewhere.3 4. The attempt on Ibn Sand’s life by certain Yemenis outside the Kaaba on the 15th March produced little more than a passing emotion, thanks to his prudence in forbidding reprisals against Yemeni pilgrims and his determination not to make the affair a cause of quarrel with the King of the Yemen. It invested his heir apparent, the Amir Saud, with some glory, as he was credited with having saved his father’s life. Soon after this, the prince became much more conspicuous in foreign eyes than he had ever been before by undertaking a grand tour in Europe from which he returned to Jedda on the 25th August. In Saudi Arabia itself much has been done to emphasise the Amir’s position as second man in the realm, a fact all the more worth noting as the possibility of the King abdicating in his favour was again being canvassed towards the end of the year. 5. Full attention will be given later to these and other important matters, including the attitude of Ibn Saud towards the Italo-Ethiopian crisis, or rather towards the two Powers, who are for him the real protagonists, viz., Great Britain and Italy, and his reception of Sir Andrew Ryan at Riyadh in November. Reference will also be made to his attitude towards pan-Arab nationalism, which seemed to evolve during the year, not in the direction of promoting the creation of a single united Arabia under one head, but of consolidating the mutual relations of the principal independent Arab States already in existence and making this serve the realisation of national aspirations in other Arab areas. 6. Saudi Arabia was still unprosperous during 1935, but it was not quite so lean a year as those that preceded it, and there was rather more promise for the future. The total number of overseas pilgrims increased from about 25,000 in 1934 to about 34,000 in 1935. Rain was abundant in the winter of 1934-35. The pilgrimage is not expected to show any further increase in 1936, and may well be smaller, but the early winter rains of 1935-36 have again been good. Moreover, the prospects of oil in Hasa seemed by the end of the year to be promising, and high hopes were entertained of the gold-mining enterprise in the Hejaz of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), whose success in one area seemed to be fairly assured and who were arranging to prospect extensively in others. If the hopes of the promoters of these two enterprises are realised, it should help greatly with the still unbalanced finances of the country. Meanwhile, they already provide an appreciable amount of employment. Trade has probably improved somewhat, with advantage to the inhabitants of Mecca and Jedda, but this may be due less to a real increase of prosperity than to adventitious circum stances, like the tendency to over-buy which is apt to follow a good pilgrimage and which was accentuated in the autumn of 1935 by the effects of the crisis in world affairs. II.— Foreign Relations. (A) With States in Arabia. (1) Iraq. 7. The most definite development in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq in 1935 was the conclusion of a provisional agreement, signed at Jedda on the 12th February, regarding the overland route for pilgrims from Nejef to Medina via Hail. Great publicity was given to the project in the Saudi press and elsewhere, but much disappointment was felt over the smallness of the numbers carried, in comparison with the real or alleged expectations of the Iraqis. Three or four convoys, consisting of small cars, came through. According to the final Saudi estimate, they carried 384 pilgrims, while His Majesty’s Embassy in Bagdad put the total at 398. They included a party of seventy-three Iraqi “boy” scouts. Little information is available as to the conditions in which they travelled, a point which would appear to be of more real importance than the numbers in the case of a first experiment. 8. The scouts proved to be very well-grown young men and were treated with much attention. The King himself had a party for them, and made a speech in which he applauded their movement, so beneficial to the progress of Arabs. He proclaimed the solidarity between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and described the latter as a bulwark which would prevent hostile penetration of [13078] B 2Saudi Arabia. He recorded three vows, one of which was that, so long as he lived, he would maintain friendship with Iraq. His declaration bore out in more express terms a friendly reference to Iraq in an interview which His Majesty gave to journalists after the attempt on his life at the Kaaba. 9. Less importance might attach to these Royal utterances made at glowing moments did they not appear to correspond with a real political rapprochement between the two countries. Very early in the year the Iraqi representative in Jedda told Sir Andrew Ryan that the attitude of the Saudi Government had improved so much that they must surely want something. A little later Fuad Bey referred to the possibility of the visit of an Iraqi delegation in which Nuri Pasha as Said might take part. As time went on it became increasingly evident that both parties were contemplating negotiations, ostensibly to settle a limited range of particular questions, like passports, trans-frontier trade and the like, but with a view also to a larger, if not closely defined, political objective. Matters were delayed by the internal troubles in Iraq in the early spring, but in April, if not earlier, draft agreements began to be bandied about. 10. In the first days of July the Iraqi Prime Minister gave to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad the draft of a proposed treaty of friendship, which confirmed the surmise that the settlement of particular questions was a less immediate object than a redefinition of the political relations between the two countries. 1 his draft, which was one of several, need not be described in detail. It contemplated a general political agreement which was to be supplemented by several others regarding particular subjects and which was not to come into force until these had been negotiated. But this phase in the negotiations was superseded in the course of the following months. This may have been partly due to private exchanges of views between statesmen, e.g., between Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Fuad Bey Hamza, who met personally in London in July. It was probably still more due to the growth in Arab circles generally of the conviction that Europe was moving towards wars which would provide an opportunity for the realisation of Arab national aspirations. On the 4th November Nuri Pasha spoke to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Bagdad of the probability of his visiting the Hejaz at pilgrimage time, i.e., about the end of February 1936. There was nothing in this to suggest more than that the earlier plan was being pursued after a period of delay; and there was obviously no foundation foi a lepoi t ciiculated in Egypt early in December that the two States had already concluded a treaty not merely of friendship, but of alliance. 11. The report just mentioned was promptly denied in Bagdad but on the 23rd December Nuri Pasha admitted to His Majesty’s Ambassador’in Bagdad that proposals had been made from the Saudi side, which, if adopted, would make the proposed treaty one of defensive alliance. The Iraqi Government had agreed to receive Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in Bagdad to discuss the matter, and Nuri Pasha hoped that sufficient progress would be made to enable him to conclude a treaty (he did not himself say a treaty of alliance) when he visited the Hejaz. 12 To carry the story further would be to anticipate the report for 1936, but in view of the importance of the matter, it may here be said that developments early in January pointed to the possibility of a treaty on definitely pan-Arab lines, providing for a close defensive alliance, the possibility of the accession of other States, and a good deal of meddling by the parties in the affairs of neigh bouring Arab countries, in which Great Britain and France have special interests. 13. There is some connexion between what precedes and a suggestion, apparently emanating from the Iraqi Government, that Saudi Arabia might join m the non-aggression pact which had been spoken of in the course of the year between lurkey, Persia and Iraq, with the possible participation of Afghanistan also. Ibn Saud’s reaction to this suggestion is not known. On the one hand, he would probably prefer to avoid commitments to Turkey and Persia On the other, he might agree to the suggestion rather than see Iraq drawn into an exclusively Turco-Persian orbit. 14. Nuri Pasha’s attitude regarding the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations is also of interest in the above connexions, but it falls to be dealt with later, in paragraph 114.5 15. Throughout these transactions the Iraqis have made a great show, and the Saudis some little show, of taking His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom into their confidence. It is doubtful whether the confidence is complete. Both parties realise that it would be dangerous to go too far in directions which might indispose His Majesty’s Government. The persons most concerned, how ever, are all Arab nationalists, who, even if some of them doubt the practicability of “ pan-Arabism in our time,” regard some sort of pan-Arabism as the ultimate objective to be steadily pursued. His Majesty’s Government on their side have not receded from the position (see paragraph 61 of the report for 1934) that they would view with sympathy a legitimate rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq; but they could not view with sympathy or without misgiving a rapprochement on lines inimical to their interests in Arab countries adjacent to the two parties. 16. In this connexion reference must be made, not for the only time in this report, to certain statements attributed to Fuad Bey by the Difaa newspaper of Jaffa in August. He afterwards told Sir Andrew Ryan that he had not intended to give an interview, and had refrained from publishing a dementi only because he thought that it would advertise the matter and lead to further publicity. He did not deny that the article reflected his sentiments. It represented him as having spoken of the inevitability of war in Europe, an event in which Arabs would be guided by their interests not by their feelings. He was said to have expressed belief in the readiness of both Saudi Arabia and Iraq to seize their opportunities, of the prospect of an early rapprochement between them and of the pursuance of parallel policies as something which would conduce to the realisation of national aspirations. 17. The revolt in the Euphrates region early in the year seems to have had an unsettling effect on the tribes across the border, but no serious trouble on the Saudi-Iraqi frontier was reported at any time during the year. Ibn Saud’s attitude towards the rebellion appears to have been correct and cautious, although he is sometimes suspected of flirting with Shia elements in Iraq. The breeze in diplomatic relations described in paragraph 10 of the report for 1934 had no after effects in 1935. The same Saudi Charge d’Affaires remained all the year in Bagdad. The Iraqi Charge in Jedda went to Bagdad early in April, leaving only a clerk in charge of the Legation. He never returned, but this was probably due more to his dislike of Jedda than to anything in the political relations between the two countries. (2) Transjordan. 18. The question of the lie of the Saudi-Transjordan frontier will be dealt with in paragraph 59 below, as being mainly a matter affecting Anglo-Saudi relations. As for the actual situation on the frontier in 1935, it is satisfactory to note that not a single raid was alleged by way of formal protest from either side to have occurred during the year; nor has there been any evidence of raiding in the reports of the Transjordan frontier officers. There was, indeed, no lack of complaint by the authorities on both sides of the attitude of their opposite numbers across the frontier. As usual, there appeared to be more substance in the complaints from Transjordan, which need not be enumerated, but which may be put down to two main causes. 19 Early in the year the Saudi Government created three new posts close to the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier at Haql on the coast, Alqan between the coast and the track of the Hejaz Railway, and Dhat-al-Hajj on that track. These were at first directly dependent on the new Saudi preventive administration in Mecca (see paragraph 175 of the report for 1934). They would appear to have been later transferred to the local governors. The excess of zeal and misconduct of the garrisons at Alqan and to some extent Haql led to incidents in the frontier area soon after their creation and again in the autumn. The other main cause of trouble was the maintenance in the governorate of Kaf of that very truculent person Salih-bin-Abdul-Wahid, the author of many pin-pricks. It was hoped that, when he went on leave in April, he would not return. He was, however, sent [13078] b 3back in due course, notwithstanding the strong hints given by the Legation to the Saudi Government that he would be better employed elsewhere. 20. The Transjordan authorities were able to maintain better relations with the Governor of Tebuk. Two meetings took place in 1935 between him and the officer commanding the Transjordan desert patrol, the first at Dhat-al-Hajj in February, the other at Meshaitiya, just east of Mudawwara, on the 30th September. They do not appear to have been conducted on the lines laid down in the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty of 1933 and the Governor showed signs of reserve, but they produced some good results. 21. Early in March the Saudi Government started a series of complaints about real or alleged restrictions on freedom of trade with Transjordan. The details need not be entered into as the Transjordan Government were able to give a considerable measure of satisfaction as regards both passport requirements and quarantine restrictions. They sought no quid yro quo as they found it to their own interest to reduce restrictions as much as possible in the interests of trade. The Saudi Government acknowledged the concessions in an unusually grateful note of the 26th October, in which, however, they asked for more. No decision by the Transjordan Government on the points still at issue was notified to the Legation up to the end of December. It may be noted that the trans-frontier trade via Mudawwara was satisfactorily brisk during the spring and summer, although the Saudi Government were stated in September to have prohibited exports from Haql via Aqaba. Saudis returning to their own country and Trans- jordanians entering it had more to complain of than Saudis proceeding to Transjordan, owing especially to the severity of the Saudi customs tariff. 22. Some mention must be made of one incident of an unusual character, less because of its intrinsic importance than because of the publicity it received owing to the fact that the principal person concerned was Captain J. Chamberlain of the Transjordan Frontier Force, a son of Sir Austen Chamberlain. On the 14th July this officer had nothing better to do than to proceed in an armed car to Haql without any sort of authority to do so, thus gratuitously violating Saudi territory. Owing to defective communications, it took some time to arrange for the release of Captain Chamberlain and others detained by the Saudi post at Haql. They were eventually released on the 24th July after correspondence in Jedda with the Saudi Government, and after the Amir Saud, then in London, had, it was said, intervened with his father to promote the happy ending. The official reaction of the Saudi Government was bitter-sweet. They agreed to release the party but tried to make out that similar violations of the frontier had been frequent, and insinuated rather than stated that they were tolerated by the British authorities. The best answer to this insinuation was that Captain Chamberlain was, after investigation, removed from the Transjordan Frontier Force and left the country, facts of which the Saudi Government were duly apprised. 23. The personal relations between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah were friendly throughout the year. They exchanged telegrams on all ceremonial occasions and may have corresponded on matters of business—the Amir showed the British Resident at Amman in January letters which had passed regarding the Hashimite properties in the Hejaz, in connexion with which the King had given satisfactory assurances. The most notable event, however, in the develop ment of friendly relations, was a visit paid by the Amir Saud to Amman on his way back from Europe in August. When the Amir was leaving Jedda, the Amir Abdullah telegraphed an invitation, which was favourably received. Even after it had been decided that the Crown Prince should cut Turkey, Syria and Iraq out of his itinerary, Ibn Saud insisted that, as the invitation to Amman had been accepted, the visit must be paid. The Prince arrived at Amman on the 16th August and stayed with the Amir Abdullah until the 19th. The Trans jordan authorities took great precautions to prevent any exploitation of the event for political purposse. The Amir Saud. on his side, behaved with great discretion. The same cannot be said of Fuad Bey Hamza, who preferred not to stay at the palace but took up his quarters in an hotel, where he is believed to have consorted with politicians hostile to the Amir of Transjordan and his Government. It came to light later that Fuad Bey had tried without success to promote a reconciliation between the Amir and the Istiqlal party./ a 7 (3) Yemen. 24. Good sense and an appearance at least of good feeling were the characteristics of Saudi-Yemeni relations in 1935. There were not infrequent rumours of fresh trouble between the two countries, but there is no evidence that S** they were more than fanciful interpretations of imperfectly known facts. It is true that the Imam’s eldest son was restless and disgruntled and is suspect in Saudi eyes. It is also doubtless true that Ibn Baud has an eye to the eventualities that might follow the Imam’s death, an event which is falsely reported from time to time and which must really happen one day. It is possible that the King has, as has often been suggested, some understanding with Seyyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, who is likely to play an important part, when the question of a succession to the throne arises in the Yemen. In the meantime, however, it is plausible to suppose that Ibn Saud is less concerned with internal Yemeni affairs than with the consolidation of his own position in Asir and in Najran, and that troop movements, which have been construed as preparations for a new war with the Imam, are directed rather to that object. 25. A minor proof of the good sense mentioned above was given on the Saudi side, when the Saudi Government denied in January the report that they were interested in a rogue named As Sakkaf, who was on his trial at Sana for some imposture and who had been spoken of as a spy. A much greater proof of it was given when the King’s life was attempted by a party of Yemenis outside the Kaaba on the 15th March. Opinion in Ihn Baud’s entourage was greatly inflamed, and it might have gone hard with the Yemeni pilgrims had not he himself exercised a moderating influence. Severe police measures were taken, but there were no general reprisals, and Abdullah-al-Wazir, who had come on pilgrimage, continued to be treated as an honoured guest. The Iman sent telegrams full of horror and regret. 1 he Ministers for Foieign Affairs corresponded less piously but without acrimony. Fuad Fey Hamza paid a tribute in private conversation to the seriousness of the investigation undertaken by the Yemeni Government. Its ineptitude was proved by the report transmitted to the Saudi Government and published by them on the 3rd May, but it was published without criticism. It was clear throughout that Ibn Saud had no intention of making the affair a casus belli, despite the fact that it was widely believed in Saudi circles, and possibly by the King himself, that the Yemeni Crown Prince had had a hand in organising the outrage. 26. There was much talk at intervals during the year of the appointment of commissioners to delimit the Saudi-Yemen frontier, in accordance with article 4 of the Treaty of Taif of May 1934. This matter hung fire for unknown reasons, but on the 22nd November the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura announced the appointment of two Saudi commissions, one for the delimitation in the coastal area, the other for the interior. Nothing is known as yet about the first commission, which was said to have already left Jizan for the frontier district. The other was composed of a relative of the Minister of Finance, and a former officer in the Turkish army now employed in the Saudi police administra tion, with others not so well known. News of them was received from Najran about the end of December. (4) Hadhramaut. 27 It is occasionally suggested that Ibn Saud interests himself in the Hadhramaut It is probably true that certain Hadhramis and persons connected with the Irshad faction in Java, with which he has various contacts, urge him to come in and put an end to the disorder which they represent as being rampant. There is no evidence, however, of any readiness on the King s part to risk embroiling himself with Great Britain by listening to such appeals. While his name and°fame are familiar to various sections of the Hadhrami people, there is equally little evidence that he counts for much m the eyes of the tribes whose areas extend northward from the Hadhramaut. In a letter written m February 1935 the Resident at Aden suggested that, if the Hadhramis turned to any outside ruler they would be more likely to look to the King of the \ emen than to Ibn S-uid’ It may he noted in this connexion that, in the discussions with His Maiesty’s Government regarding their eastern and south-eastern frontiers, the Saudi Government have been at pains to disclaim any pretension to the allegiance [13078] B 4of tribes based on the Hadhramaut ; on the other hand, the point was made by Fuad Bey Hamza in his conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan in Riyadh in November that the Saudi Government would have to be careful to avoid prejudicing by an agreement with His Majesty’s Government any possible claims of the King of the Yemen. (5) Muscat and Oman. 28. Ibn Saud appears to regard the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman as being definitely outside his orbit. It is probable that he knows little of its internal politics, and that he regards the predominant form of Islam there with repugnance. It is not likely that he knows very much either about the position in the interior of the sultanate. It is, however, worth noting that early in the year Fuad Bey Hamza expressed curiosity as to whether there was not a ruler independent of the Sultan in the hinterland of Muscat and Oman. During the conversations at Riyadh in November, Fuad Bey, when told that the consent of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman would be necessary to any frontier agreement, threw out the remark that the Sultan would agree to anything, as he had so much Double with two personages in his hinterland, viz., Af Kharusi and A1 Khalili On this occasion Fuad Bey seemed to know a little more than he did in February, but not much. The Legation in Jedda also is very ill-informed regarding the two personages mentioned. (6) Trucial Sheikhdoms and Qatar. 29. Previous reports in this series have more than once acquitted Ibn Saud ol any recent violation of his obligation under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda to maintain friendly and peaceful relations .... with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Loast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty s Government.” Developments in 1935 make it necessary to examine more closely his attitude not so much because it is new, as because these develop ments have brought it into prominence, and because of the growing importance for His Majesty s Government of resisting any Saudi pretensions in the coastal aiea from the south of the Gulf of Bahrein to the confines of the Sultanate of uscat and Oman, i hat attitude is composed of many elements, including the King s contempt for the puniness of the sheikhs, his wish to regard them as far as possible as rulers of enclaves on the coast, without rights in the desert, his is ike °f his admitted obligation to respect their special treaty position vis-d-vis 0± i 1 ^ M l a . jes i ys Government, his unwillingness to admit'that the position precludes him from haying direct relations with them, and, finally, his inclination as he dare not absorb them, to exploit the bonds of Arab brotherhood and community of religion (though the latter is not much mentioned nowadays) between him and them. J 7 3 .U T u he - f ? re S oin g definition is sufficiently accurate for working purposes even though it be too precise to explain every gesture of a monarch who is both oppoitunist and temperamental and who feels that any really serious clash with Great Britain might be ruinous to him. This abiding anxiety in his mind is all to the good. Against it must be set the fact that the sheikhs thenrilves ar'impressed by Ibn baud s greatness, even when, to quote a famous phrase of Colonel Fowle’s WnD 6 CC ! Urs ? of the correspondence m 1935, “ They regard him as the Big Bad Wolf, who but for His Majesty s Government, would swallow them up ” The Political Resident added, “ and so long as they are confident of His Majesty’s Government s piotection the less they have to do with him the better they will'be pleased ; but, to put it bluntly, the sheikhs have no reason for unqualified con fidence in the protection of His Majesty’s Government against Ibn Saud. Lord Cuizon, in a speech to the sheikhs in 1903, spoke equally of His Maiestv’s Government s respect for their independence and their determination to uphoM rr- ivyr • IJ ot ’ he said, wipe out the most unselfish page in history.” But His Majesty s Government have tended increasingly to add to the pa^e the some what selfish gloss that they are not committed 'to protect the Sheikhs f mm m^to the^he^k^of ot' ^ WlU ^ seen 1 below that ^ wa s only as an induce- ent to the Sheikh of Qatar to grant an oil concession in accordance with their ^ Gntered mt0 a special comm itnient of the kind vis-d-vis that ruler9 31. What wonder then that the coastal rulers, however fearful they may be of the Big Bad Wolf, show a tendency to reinsure with him ? It is only five years or so since the Sheikh of Bas-al-Khaimah declared that, in certain contingencies, he would place himself under the protection of Ibn Saud rather than succumb to British pressure. The relations between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King before and after the sheikh’s visit to Riyadh in 1933 have never been elucidated. 32. It is all the more important to stress the foregoing general considera tions, as they apply to some extent, mutatis mutandis, to the position of Koweit and Bahrein also vis-d-vis His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. We may now turn to the particular developments in 1935 which have suggested them. 33. When Sir Andrew Ryan resumed conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza in January regarding various outstanding questions, including that of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, Fuad Bey tried to assert the position that His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to respect Arab indepen dence and that the local rulers concerned should be made in some way direct parties to any settlement. He suggested that it might be easier for the Saudi Govern ment to make concessions to “ their Arab brethren ” than to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. He was at first perhaps giving expression rather to his own sentiments than to any considered views of the King, but he restated his contention in more guarded terms on the 7th February, when he professed to be speaking under instructions. The matter gave rise to a good deal of correspondence among British authorities. Eventually Sir Andrew Ryan, interpreting the instructions of His Majesty’s Government, made the following formal declaration to Fuad Bey on their behalf on the 20th February :— “ His Majesty’s Government cannot fail to be disturbed by any attempt to cast doubt on their position in regard to matters affecting the foreign relations of Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms. That position, which is the result of a long historical process, is established by agreements between them and the rulers, which have been communicated to His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. Any attempt to question it would make a solution of the question now at issue impossible, and would seriously affect the relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government. At the same time they draw the attention of the Saudi Government to the fact that it has been a constant object of their policy to promote good relations among all Arab States.” 34. This declaration drove Fuad Bey to earth, but a later episode of a different kind shows how reluctant the Saudi Government are to abandon their fundamental attitude. Following on long preliminaries, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf addressed a note to the Sheikh of Qatar on the 11th May, promising him British protection against serious and unprovoked attach by land, subject to certain conditions, the most immediate of which was that he should give to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the concession for which they had been negotiating. The concession was duly granted on the 1 / th May. When Ibn Saud got wind of the matter, he wrote a direct letter to the sheikh dated the 6th Augus^. He stated in terms too long to reproduce his views on the British position the coastal rulers and connected matters. He went on to remonstrate with the sheikh for having granted or intending to grant an oil concussion awaitmg a settlement of the boundary question. He suggested that it should be settled either between him and the British or that the sheikh should Hl s ¥ 1 a 3 est y s Government to allow it to be settled direct between himself and the sheikh. He stated that if the concessionnaires started operations before the boundary weie settled he would be “ compelled to protest and stop operations. 35. It was not until a month later that Sheikh Yusuf Yasm took the matter up with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Jedda. In due course Mr. Ca ver was instructed to take exception to Ibn Baud’s action in addressing the sheikh direct on a matter affecting his foreign affairs to defend the grant of the con- cessTon on the ground that the conceded area lay in territory m which no rights of the Saudi Government could be admitted for reasons explained to Fuad Bey Ham Za in July and to inform the Saudi Government that His Majesty s Govern- men™ had promised protection to the sheikh against any aggression, more [13078] ® 510 particularly as regards the oil concession area. Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda was formally invoked. Mr. Calvert carried out his instructions in a letter to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin of the 26th September. 36. The first point dealt with in Mr. Calvert’s instructions is the most important in connexion with the subject of this section. Sheikh Yusuf retorted in a letter of the 15th October, in which he expressly claimed that article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda did not preclude direct correspondence with the rulers named in it, and stated that “ correspondence is exchanged between His Majesty and them in respect of various affairs, because this assures the friendly and peaceful relations which His Majesty undertook to maintain.” 37. By this time Sir Andrew Ryan’s visit to Riyadh was well in sight, and His Majesty’s Government preferred to postpone further discussion of the question of direct correspondence, as all matters affecting the position between Saudi Arabia and Qatar were bound up with the settlement of the frontier question, which was to be the subject of new proposals on the Minister’s arrival. The fate of these proposals will be related later. It need only be said here that in his conversations at Riyadh Sir Andrew Ryan strongly reasserted the position of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the foreign affairs of their clients on the Persian Gulf and restated their objections to Ibn Sand’s having addressed the Sheikh of Qatar direct. On this occasion Fuad Bey did not attempt to contest Sir Andrew Ryan’s arguments, but advanced a new suggestion that an alleged direct agreement between the sheikh and Ibn Saud, prior to the Anglo-Qatar Treaty of 1916, was in any case binding, as the sheikh must be held to have been a free agent before the date of that treaty. 38. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s letter of the 15th October shows up an apparent weakness in the language of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, which might be held to mean that, if relations were to be friendly and peaceful, there must be relations. This view was rebutted in an important Foreign Office despatch of the 16th November, which concluded from an examination not only of the text of article 6, but of other relevant considerations also, that the Saudi view was untenable. 39. This already long section would not be complete without a further reference to the language attributed to Fuad Bey in the newspaper article mentioned in paragraph 16 above. Fuad Bey was represented as having supple mented his language about the value of a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq as a step towards the realisation of Arab national aspirations by the following sentence : ‘ ‘ The small amirates which you see on the coasts of Arabia will not stand before the hurricane, as their existence is contrary to the law of nature.” This could be read as referring to an ultimate ideal rather than to the immediate objectives of Saudi policy, but, if it was said, it exposed the speaker, a responsible Saudi statesman, to the reproach of grave indiscretion. 40. Finally, attention must be drawn to the personal intercourse of the Persian Gulf rulers with the Governor of Hasa, and to some extent with Ibn Saud himself. Visits were paid to the late Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi by the ruler of Dibai at the end of September 1935, and by the ruler of Ras-al-Khaimah in October. The ruler of Sharjah proceeded to Hofuf in November to condole with Ibn Jiluwi’s son, and went on to see the King at Riyadh. The Political Agent at Bahrein saw no present reason to attach political importance to this excursion. It seemed to be generally accepted, he said, that the journeys of the various chiefs to Hasa and their attempts to get to Ibn Saud, who had ordered Ibn Jiluwi to discourage visits to Riyadh, were undertaken with the object of receiving money and presents. Even so, it is difficult to regard without misgiving the tendency of British clients on the Persian Gulf to look to Ibn Saud as the big noise in their vicinity. The danger of their being drawn into the King’s orbit may be somewhat increased by the fairly frequent visits to Saudi Arabia of their relatives. Brothers of the Sheikhs of Dibai and Sharjah made the pilgrimage in 1935, and a brother of the Sheikh of Bahrein repaired to the mainland in November. This list is not necessarily complete. (7) Bahrein. 41. The discussion of the subject of Bahrein transit dues was resumed in February, after His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had agreed (see paragraph 56 below) to deal separately with each of the major questions[13078] b 6 u —7 -7 ( / outstanding between them and the Saudi Government. Ibn Saud at last agreed to the proposal of His Majesty’s Government that the issues should be explored by a local conference, assisted by the Political Agent at Bahrein, with the object of arriving at a solution ad referendum. Three Saudi delegates, accompanied by Sheikh Muhammad-at-Tawil, Director of Customs, &amp;c., in Hasa, arrived in /** Bahrein on the 9th March. Among the principal points discussed were the non repetition of the Ahmedi procedure (see paragraph 59 of the report for 1933) and the treatment of goods consigned to Ibn Saud and his Government. Bahrein was prepared to agree that the Ahmedi procedure should not be repeated. Ibn Saud preferred to renounce any special treatment of goods consigned to himself and his Government in consideration of a reduction of transit dues all round. On the 7th April the principal Bahreini delegate addressed a letter to the principal Saudi delegate stating his understanding of the upshot of the conversations. The principal Saudi delegate replied in terms which were vague, but were understood to be an acceptance. 42. The event showed that there were several loose ends to be tied up. In particular, His Majesty’s Government were anxious that the agreement should be for a fixed period, and the Saudi Government, while not objecting to this as regards the other terms, were insistent that the undertaking not to repeat the Ahmedi procedure should be perpetual. To cut a very long story short, the matter was eventually settled by two exchanges of notes between His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Jedda and the Saudi Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th-l7th November, 1935. One set of notes provided that the transit duty on goods landed at Bahrein for re-export should be maintained at 2 per cent.; that the duty on goods transhipped at sea should be reduced to If per cent.; that no exemption should be asked for in the case of goods consigned to the King and his Government; and that the duty on Saudi dates imported into Bahrein should not exceed 5 per cent. There were certain other provisions, including a clause entitling either side to terminate the operation of the agreement on giving six months’ notice. The other exchange of notes incorporated an undertaking by His Majesty’s Government and the Bahrein Government that the latter would not repeat the Ahmedi procedure, i.e., would not at any future time claim dues on goods in ships calling at Bahrein, when such goods were intended to be carried direct in the same ships to their destination. 43. The second exchange of notes was that to which the Saudi Government attached most importance, as it deprived Bahrein of one possible means of discouraging the development of Saudi steamer ports at Ras Tanura or elsewhere on the mainland. In principle, the Saudi Government would still like to create such ports, but no active steps seem to have been taken in 1935 to develop Ras Tanura further. The question of mainland ports may become a live one if oil is struck in Hasa in important commercial quantities, unless indeed a scheme, which was mentioned last summer, materialises, i.e., that the oil from Hasa should be conveyed by pipe-line to Bahrein. 44. Some little confusion arose in Bahrein over the date of entry into force of the agreements described above. As, however, the notes themselves provided for entry into force as from the date of the exchanges of notes, this was easily put right. What is more interesting to note is that some slight confusion was also caused by direct correspondence between the Acting Governor of Hasa and the Sheikh of Bahrein, as the Saudi Government were perplexed by the sheikh’s replies to a letter from the Acting Governor forwarding copies of the notes exchanged in Jedda. The fact that this communication was made has a bearing on the subject discussed in paragraphs 29 ff. above. (8) Koweit and the Koweit Neutral Zone. 45. After His Majesty’s Government had agreed in February (see paragraph 56 below) to deal separately with each of the major questions outstanding between them and the Saudi Government, negotiations for an agreement to terminate the Koweit blockade were resumed. On the 25th February the Saudi Government agreed (without reverting to the former difficulty over the Sheikh of Koweit’s old claims against Ibn Saud) to a local meeting of commis sioners to frame recommendations as to how trade across the frontier should be regulated. Various circumstances delayed this meeting. It was not until the12 16th June that three Saudi delegates reached Koweit. The conference, which was attended by the Political Agent, lasted from the 17th to the 28th June. The Koweiti delegates proposed the establishment of one or more customs posts in Saudi territory, to which the Sheikh of Koweit would undertake to direct all trade under a manifest system. The Saudi delegates torpedoed the possibility of an agreement on that or, indeed, any other basis by making it a conditio sine qua non that the sheikh should give an absolute guarantee that no smuggling whatsoever would take place. At first they suggested that even a single case of smuggling should upset the agreement. They relented only to the extent of stating that the agreement would be cancelled if more than three cases occurred. They rejected the alternative offered by the Koweiti delegation, namely, that the Koweit Government should pledge their honour to do all in their power to prevent smuggling. In these circumstances the conference broke down. The Saudi delegates, though impressed by and apparently grateful for the hospitality of their reception, were inconceivably arrogant in the actual negotiations. 46. The deadlock continued in spite of remonstrances addressed to Fuad Bey Hamza during his visit to London and further correspondence in Jedda, in the course of which Mr. Calvert confirmed in writing a previous intimation that His Majesty’s Government would do all in their power to ensure the fulfilment of the honourable undertaking offered by the sheikh. At last, however, when Sir Andrew Ryan was in Riyadh in November, he was able, bv the use of great pressure, including an intimation, under express instructions, that His Majesty’s Government regarded Ibn Saud’s attitude towards Koweit as inconsistent with his professions of friendship towards them, to drive the Saudis into a withdrawal of their impossible condition. They proposed instead additional safeguards, mainly in the nature of a control of merchants as well as of goods. These were under consideration at the end of the year. 47. The preliminaries of the conference at Koweit were clouded and the subsequent issues somewhat confused by an incident early in May. Large numbers of Saudi tribesmen had been attracted into Koweit by good grazing. On the 6th May a small party of Saudi armed men, retainers of the Governor of Hasa, detached from a larger party of tax collectors, entered Koweit territory and proceeded to warn the Saudi tribesmen at at least two places that they must come back to be taxed. The men were rounded up and taken to Koweit, whence they were allowed to return to Hasa. His Majesty’s Government protested against the intrusion and the assertion of Saudi authority in Koweit territory. This protest drove Ibn Saud into one of his Royal rages, and, apart from his indignant efforts to minimise the affair, his displeasure manifested itself in two ways. He insisted on attaching an inordinate number of hangers-on to the delegation which he was sending to Koweit, and he tried to insist in the official correspondence about the incident that all movement across the frontier should be restricted pending the conclusion of some general agreement. His Majesty’s Government evaded this demand, but it may have influenced the nature of Fuad Bey’s suggestions to Sir Andrew Ryan regarding additional safeguards to prevent smuggling. 48. The blockade was maintained with as much severity as possible during the year, and especially after the breakdown of the conference, which the Saudi Government alleged, apparently more for the good of the cause than because it was true, to have been followed by a great increase in smuggling. 49. Ibn Saud was said to be very angry with the Sheikh of Koweit for having got him into trouble with His Majesty’s Government over the incident described in the last paragraph but one. In November, however, the Political Agent was able to report an improvement of their personal relations, thanks to the King s childish pleasure at receiving a present of hawks from the sheikh. Two instances came to light during the year of direct correspondence on official matters, once in February, when an agreement was reached about Koweiti pilgrims carrying special passes, and again in November, when the rulers exchanged letters on a proposal by Ibn Saud to enforce a system known as Arafa in connexion with camel claims on the frontier. These cases show that the subject discussed in paragraphs 29 ff. above has a very material bearing on the relations between Koweit and Saudi Arabia. It will be remembered that in 1934 a proposal to13 [13078] B 7 canalise correspondence on official matters through the British authorities was rejected by the Sheikh of Koweit himself (see paragraph 45 of the report for 1934). 50. No new question of importance arose in connexion with the Koweit /v Neutral Zone in 1935. The Saudi Government did not pursue with His Majesty’s Government the question of an oil concession. Mr. Abdul-Ghani Ydlibi and his associates made strong efforts to straighten out the tangle described in paragraphs 50 and 51 of the report for 1934, but the complication resulting from the option granted to the Standard Oil Company of California in 1933 continued to defeat their efforts both with the Saudi Government and with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. A representative of that company discussed the subject with Mr. Rendel at the Foreign Office on the 17th July, but more, apparently, with the object of taking soundings as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government than of showing his company’s own hand. Later in the year a new concern, Petroleum Concessions (Limited), representing the same interests as the Iraq Petroleum Company, manifested interest in the Neutral Zone, as well as in other potential areas in the Persian Gulf littoral. They hoped to find means to eliminate the complication created by the Standard Oil Company of California option. No progress in this direction was actually made up to the end of the year. Thus, the whole position remained as tangled as ever throughout the whole of 1935. (9) General. 51. Various passages in the preceding sub-sections suggest that the relations of Ibn Baud with his neighbours in Arabia cannot be regarded solely from the point of view of his relations with individual States, but must also be looked at with reference to the various schemes for the creation of a United Arabia in some shape or form. 52. It is still pretty safe not to attach too great importance to the activities of the idealists, who dream of the possibility of a single State comprising all Arabia and even Egypt. Such persons are numerous among the Syrians and Palestinians, but they have shown no capacity for united action. Ibn Saud himself said, with special reference to Palestine, in an interview with Arab journalists published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 22nd March after the attempt on his life, “ Palestine is one of the Arab countries, and what pleases the Arabs pleases me, and what grieves them grieves me; but the misfortunes of the Arabs in all their countries and territories come from their own selves and are due to their disunion. . . . Owing to their disunion the Arabs have harmed themselves more than the foreigners have harmed them.” 53. In other passages of the interview just mentioned the King mentioned in terms of gratitude and sympathy the peoples of Egypt, Iraq and Morocco. He did not mention Syria, possibly because no Syrian journalist was present. Whatever he may say or leave unsaid, he appears to have little real use for nationalists of the idealist type. He has tended much more of late to countenance the policy of these practical politicians, of whom Nuri Pasha and Fuad Bey Hamza are examples, who favour as a present objective the establishment of closer relations between the major Arab States already in being as separate entities, and of drawing into their orbit other potential factors in an Arab confederation, like Syria, Palestine and the Persian Gulf rulers. It is probable that Ibn Saud himself will still use great caution in regard to anything likely to embroil him definitely with Great Britain and France, but he may well be attracted by the idea of becoming the dominant factor in any such Arab combine, and he may have been impressed in the second half of 1935 by the conviction in many Arab circles (cf. paragraphs 10 and 16 above) that war in Europe is inevitable and will afford an opportunity for the realisation of Arab national aspirations. 54. It may be appropriately mentioned here that strong efforts were made by certain Palestinians during the 1935 pilgrimage to enlist sympathy in Mecca with their grievances, especially their grievances against the Jews. This propaganda seems to have been genuinely displeasing to the Saudi Government, who, whatever they may think of propaganda elsewhere, have no interest in allowing an excessive exploitation of the pilgrimage for alien political purposes.14 It may also be mentioned that when the Saudi heir apparent was in Palestine from the 14th to the IGth August, he and the local Arabs were allowed great freedom. His own attitude was correct, but the Arabs, who received him with enthusiasm, talked a great deal of politics. Among those who visited him was a deputation of Syrians, which, with other matters germane to the subject of this sub-section, can more conveniently be dealt with in paragraphs 71 ff. below. (B) With Powers outside Arabia. (1) British Commonwealth of Nations. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 55. The relations between Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were friendly and, indeed, cordial throughout 1935. There were no overt signs of Ibn Saud’s fundamental mistrust of British policy, and there was much evidence of his desire to stand well with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The ordinary diplomatic routine was varied by two important interludes. The Saudi heir apparent arrived in London on the 17th June, accompanied by a small suite which included Fuad Bey Hamza. The visit was technically private, but official hospitality was extended to the party for a fortnight, and they stayed on privately until the 22nd July. Great and successful efforts were made to entertain the Amir suitably to his position, and during the period of his private stay he visited the three service reviews under official auspices. The naval review, in particular, impressed him greatly. Business was discussed at the Foreign Office with Fuad Bey and the Saudi Minister in London, a silent partner, at six meetings extending from the 24th June to the 18th July. The second interlude was the visit of His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda to Riyadh, as the King’s guest, in November. Sir Andrew Ryan, having flown from Cairo to Bagdad and on to Koweit and Bahrein, landed at Uqair on the 20th November and, after a strenuous journey, arrived in Riyadh on the 23rd November. He left on the 29th November and reached Jedda on the 3rd December. He and his party, consisting of Captain de Gaury, who had come with him from Cairo, and two members of the Jedda staff, who met him at Riyadh, were treated with unbounded hospitality and distinction. Important discussions took place on a limited number of subjects. 56. At the end of 1934 His Majesty’s Government were aiming at a comprehensive settlement of the most important questions outstanding between them and the Saudi Government. When negotiations were resumed in”Jedda in January, Ibn Saud, after some hesitation, deprecated this proposal, and asked that the questions should be discussed on their individual merits. His wishes were conveyed by Fuad Bey to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 7th February in studiously disarming language, and His Majesty’s Government agreed to^ fall in with them. I he following paragraphs show the evolution of the several questions, not including those of the Bahrein transit dues and the Koweit blockade, which have been dealt with in paragraphs 41 ff. and 45 ff. above. It should be explained that theie was a considerable gap in the mam conversations m the early summer as Fuad Bey left Jedda on the 1st May, and it was agreed that the most important questions should be reserved for discussion with him in London, whither Sir Andiew Ryan pioceeded early in June in order to be m time for the Amir Saud’s visit. Similarly, although His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had his hands lull in Jedda m the autumn, certain questions were not pursued there but were reserved until Sir Andrew Ryan should visit Riyadh. 57. Eastern and South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia New instructions were issued to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 17th January as to how this question should be handled. His Majesty’s Government contemplated advancing towards a solution by various stages, beginning with a request for a clear statement of Ibn Saud s demands. I he instructions indicated various offers which His Majesty s Government were prepared to make successively. An attempt by Fuad Bey to stipulate for the direct participation of the coastal rulers concerned in any eventual settlement has already been described in Darasraoh S3 J_ J , -P , 1 T7' • , 1 ■ 1 ? , more pressed to produce a clear statement of the King s desiderata. He did this eventually on the 3rd April ihe Saudi statement was not clear at all points, but it made enormous claims! *15 [13078] - B 8 In the north Ibn Sand wished to have part of the Qatar Peninsula and a boundary which would run across the whole base of the peninsula to the Khor-al-Odeid and restart further along the coast. In the east and south he asked for vast tracts extending to meridian 56 degrees E., and to a line within easy distance of the Indian Ocean. Sir Andrew Ryan countered immediately with His Majesty’s Government’s first offer of a narrow strip of territory to the east of the “ blue line.” There were no further serious negotiations until the whole question was very closely, but again inconclusively, discussed with Fuad Bey in London in June and July. These discussions paved the way for a re-examination of the question by His Majesty’s Government in a spirit more favourable to Ibn Saud than before. Sir Andrew Ryan took to Riyadh entirely new instructions which enabled him to offer Ibn Saud a great part of what he had asked for, subject to insistence on the attribution to Qatar of the whole of the mountains or hills composing its physical structure, and a refusal to entertain the King’s demand for a boundary extending to the sea. This new offer was formally made on the 25th November, and rejected on the 26th. There was this much gained that His Majesty’s Government had given clear proof of their wish to meet the King’s desiderata pretty handsomely, and that the question was thus deprived of much of the venom which characterised it in 1934. Ibn Saud was now clearly prepared for a compromise. He pressed very strongly his claim to the Jebel Naksh in the south-west of the Qatar Peninsula, but Fuad Bey more than hinted that, if this were conceded, the King could be induced to abandon the coastal area for which he had asked towards the Khor-al-Odeid, and would reduce his demands in the south-east. So the matter remained until the end of the year. 58. Future of the Treaty of Jedda and Connected Matters .—Some account was given in paragraph 65 of the report for 1934 of the present position in regard to the Treaty of Jedda and the desire of the Saudi Government to place matters on a less precarious basis. On the 30th March, 1935, Fuad Bey Hamza made definite proposals to Sir Andrew Ryan for an exchange of notes which should prolong the validity of the treaty for ten years, subject to certain understandings. The most important of these was the abandonment of His Majesty’s Government of their right of manumitting slaves in the Hejaz and Fuad Bey propounded at the same time draft Saudi regulations of the kind foreshadowed in para graph 66 of the last report. It was obvious that no progress could be made with the proposal for the prolongation of the treaty unless the slavery question could first be disposed of or at any rate unless there was a good prospect of a settlement regarding it. Fuad Bey and Sir Andrew Ryan therefore engaged in a series of personal conversations with a view to giving the proposed regula tions, the first draft of which was very meagre, such a form as might make the promulgation of the regulations a sufficient inducement to His Majesty’s Government to renounce their right of manumission. These conversations were begun in Jedda and continued in London. Although not conclusive, they reached a point at which it was possible in the official conversations at the Foreign Office to tell Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government would be willing, subject to the completion of the slavery settlement and to agreement being reached on other points of less importance, raised by the Saudi proposal of the 30th March, to proceed to an exchange of notes prolonging the validity of the Treaty of Jedda for a term of years, not necessarily ten years. Further progress was made with the slavery negotiations during Sir Andrew Ryan’s visit to Riyadh in November, but up to the end of the year no final agreement was reached regarding the text of the proposed Saudi regulations. The question of the prolongation of the treaty also remained in abeyance, except that Sir Andrew Ryan communicated to Fuad Bey in Riyadh the text of a formula designed to replace the letters on arms traffic annexed to the original treaty, which are too wide in theii teims to be confirmed in present circumstances. The only other point requiring settle ment related to the language of the treaty, but this is not expected to give rise to any difficulty as His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept the Saudi demand that the complete equality of the English and Arabic texts should be laid down in the exchange of notes. 59. Saudi-Transjordan Frontier—The additional survey mentioned in paragraph 67 of the report for 1934 was completed just before the end of that year Early in January 1935 it once more became an acute question in London whether His Majesty’s Government should leave matters as they were with theSaudi Government, having regard to the fewness of the disputes which had arisen over particular parts of the frontier, or whether they should take the initiative in raising the whole question of the frontier with the Saudi Government. On the 3rd February the Saudi Government themselves gave a fresh impetus to the matter by again complaining, though without reference to previous correspondence of violations of their territory in the Thaniyya-Taraif area. It is unnecessary to follow the ensuing discussions in British official circles through all their ramifications. The eventual decision taken at the end of May was that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to initiate a general discussion regarding the frontier on the occasion of Fuad Bey Hamza’s visit to London in attendance on the Amir Saud, which had been arranged while the correspondence was proceeding. In order to prepare the Saudi Government for such discussion, it was decided to inform them without further delay in Jedda that the question of Thaniyya-Taraif was necessitating exhaustive study owing to defects in maps, but that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to discuss it in London. It was decided to abandon a proposal to send at the same time a belated reply to an enquiry by Fuad Bey in June 1934 in connexion with the dispute about Hazim, a dispute which, though never liquidated, had long been in abeyance. The whole subject was in due course discussed with Fuad Bey at the Foreign Office on the 15th July. An explanation by Mr. Rendel of the difficulties arising out of the inaccuracies of the maps used at the time of the conclusion of the Hadda Agreement was followed by a good deal of fencing. The outcome of the discussion was summed up in a letter from Mr. Rendel to Fuad Bey dated the 19th July. Mr. Rendel recapitulated the suggestions which he had made during the discussion, viz. : (a) that the present position should be maintained pending the settlement of other outstanding questions; or (5) that steps should be taken to ascertain the topographical facts; that an agreement should be reached as to the principles to be applied to the interpretation of the Hadda Agreement, with due regard to the essential factor of the intentions of the negotiators; and that in due course a commission to delimit the frontier should be appointed. He noted two counter-suggestions by Fuad Bey : (a) that the frontier should be delimited on the ground with sole reference to the geographical co-ordinates indicated in the agreement; or (b) that geographical features should be assigned to Transjordan and Saudi Arabia respectively with sole reference to their position as shown in the map used at the time. Mr. Rendel restated the difficulties which he saw in the way of Fuad Bey’s suggestions, but promised to submit them to higher authority. He asked Fuad Bey to submit his own proposals to Ibn Saud. He emphasised the fact that the discussions related to the Transjordan-Nejd frontier only and did not affect the position in regard to the Transjordan-Hejaz frontier, as laid down in the relevant letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda. Since this letter was written the subject has not been further pursued with the Saudi Government. 60. Air Facilities on the Hasa Coast .—After some preliminary corres pondence His Majesty’s Government sent to the Legation in Jedda on the 28th February, for observations in the first instance, a restatement of the desiderata of the Air Ministry. The proposal to negotiate a comprehensive settlement of major outstanding questions had already been abandoned, and it was realised that the time might not be ripe for pursuing this particular question with the Saudi Government, who on their side had not pressed the matter since making the intimation mentioned in the penultimate sentence of paragraph 168 of the last report. Sir Andrew Ryan’s observations on the Air Ministry’s desiderata were delayed until the 10th May, and in the event the question was not pursued with the Saudi Government until the 15th June, when, after further departmental consideration at home, it was discussed with Fuad Bey Hamza in London. Fuad Bey’s reaction to an exposition by Mr. Rendel of the latest desiderata of the Air Ministry was amiable, subject to reservations, and on the 27th June Mr. Rendel wrote him a letter on the whole subject, showing the position reached at the end of the discussion. Fuad Bey replied on the 6th July in terms which were neither very accommodating nor completely unaccom modating. He insisted that any arrangements in regard to civil aircraft should be the subject of a commercial agreement with the interests concerned. He indicated the conditions which the Saudi Government would wish to impose in any negotiation with His Majesty’s Government about service aircraft. TheO ts 17 ftp /s situation was reviewed in a despatch from the Foreign Office to Sir Andrew Ryan of the 31st October and further instructions were given him for his guidance. It was recognised that his visit to Riyadh might not afford a favourable opportunity for pursuing the subject with the Saudi Government. This proved to be the case and no further progress was made up to the end of the year. 61. The preceding paragraphs deal with the questions which, together with the Koweit and Bahrein questions, could or might have been included in the comprehensive negotiations contemplated at the end of 1934. Space does not admit of more than the most cursory account of other questions also important but less political in their nature, which were dealt with in 1935. Inese are as follows :—■ 62. Ue]az Railway.—kitex a good deal of correspondence between the British, French and Saudi Governments, it was agreed that a technical conference should meet at Haifa in October to consider matters connected with the reconditioning of this railway as a through line. His Majesty s Governmen and the French Government waived their insistence on the acceptance ot the Lausanne Declaration (see paragraph 68 of the last report). The conference was duly held and adopted five resolutions, but the concrete result was small owing to the impossibility of an agreement as to how the expense of reconditioning should be met. 63 External Telegraphic Communications of Saudi transactions described in paragraph 69 of the last report 'P *° in Jedda during the first half of April between representatives of Cable and Wireless (Limited) and the Eastern Telegraph Company on the one hand and of the Saudi Government on the other. An agreement was concluded on the 17th April. This was also signed ad referendum by His Majesty s Mimste behalf of the Sudan Government, who subsequently confimed the agreement.^ Its main effects were a reduction in the charges for traffic m the Jedda I ort feuda cable, and to give the companies a monopoly of external tion, subject to exceptions, the most important of which wa® that the baud Government reserved the right to use their own wireless stations for oftcial communication with most other countries m Arabia, includi a • between and to establish wireless or landdine communication for the p^ihc te^ween Snudi Arabia and Yemen, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria.

The second extension prolonged the time for six lunar months from the 5th April, 1935, and on the 25th June His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires notified the Saudi Government, under instructions, that this prolongation removed any objection that His Majesty’s Government might have had to the application of the original communique to British subjects and protected persons. Mr. Calvert’s letter confirmed the caveat mentioned in paragraph 171 of the report for 1934 and added, in the spirit of an oral exchange of views between His Majesty’s Minister and Fuad Bey Hamza, an expression of the view held by His Majesty’s Govern ment that the terms of the main communique were not intended to apply to persons who, though employed in the country or staying for more than a single pilgrimage season, had clearly no intention of settling permanently in Saudi Arabia. 67. The repercussions in Saudi Arabia of the crisis in international affairs resulting from the Italian attack on Abyssinia caused Ibn Saud to consult His Majesty’s Government on various matters, using his usual method of accompanying limited confidences with unlimited professions of friendship and a desire for intimate relations with them. This is so closely bound up with the subject of his relations with Italy that it can better be dealt with below. Other British Governments. 68. No questions arose between Saudi Arabia and the self-governing Dominions. The Government of India were naturally specially interested in the question of their dispensaries in the Hejaz, and it lay with them also to deal with the practical aspects of the Saudi Government’s renewed request for the establish ment of a postal service between Asir and Kamaran (see paragraph 170 below). They and the Government of Palestine were also specially concerned with a proposal to send to certain countries, including India and Palestine, a Saudi mission to study the position of Haramayn Wakfs, i.e., religious foundations created for the benefit of the Holy Cities in the countries to be visited. According to the representations made, this mission was to have an unofficial character, although the Saudi Government were interested in its objects, and no money was to be collected. The Government of Palestine made no difficulty, subject to the members being individually unobjectionable. The Government of India, after greater hesitation, acquiesced guardedly in the sending of the mission. For some reason unknown to the Legation the mission had not started up to the end of the year. (2) France and Syria. 69. No important developments are known to have occurred during 1935 in the political relations between France and Saudi Arabia. The Amir Saud spent about nine days in Paris in June in the course of his European tour. He was entertained at luncheon at the Elysee and twice visited the Mosque and Islamic Institute in Paris, to which he gave a donation. Little is known as to what business was discussed. A press report spoke of very friendly negotiations and, more particularly, of exchanges of views regarding the intensification of economic intercourse between Syria and Saudi Arabia, and the Hejaz Railway question. Fuad Bey Hamza was said to have had a cordial conversation with the French High Commissioner for Syria. The party again made a short stay in Paris after leaving London on the 22nd July. 70. The arrangements to elevate the French consulate in Jedda to the status of a Legation and to promote the Charge d’Affaires to the rank of Minister Resident were completed in December 1935, after much delay, due in all probability more to French financial considerations than to any political reason. When the necessary French decrees were issued, the French representative was in Syria and Ibn Saud was in Nejd. The presentation of M. Maigret’s credentials therefore stood over until 1936. 71. The chief common interest of France and Saudi Arabia would still appear to be that of France in “ keeping Ibn Saud sweet as regards Syria,” to quote from the report for 1934, and that of Ibn Saud in showing correctness vis-a-vis the mandatory Power. This does not prevent him from cultivating relations with Syrian nationalists and tribal personages; but the British Legation knows too little of the attitude of the French authorities in Syria towards the19 persons concerned to judge whether these relations are displeasing to the French, who, if displeased, do not show it openly. A party of three Syrian politicians, headed by Dr. Jamil Mardam, came from Syria to the Hejaz for the 1935 pilgrimage, having travelled via Bagdad, where they were received with some ceremony. What success these gentlemen had with Ibn Saud is uncertain. A communique issued on the 29th March dignified them with the title “ Syrian delegation,” but denied an Egyptian report that they had suggested to the King the establishment of an Arab Empire. Dr. Jamil Mardam is supposed to be one of the advocates of the candidature of a Saudi prince for the throne of Syria, an idea which might conceivably appeal to Ibn Saud, if the creation of such a throne became a question of practical politics. For one thing, it might be a happy means of providing a future for his second son, the Amir Feisal. 72. The same Dr. Jamil Mardam was one of a numerous deputation of Syrians which waited on the Amir Saud during his short stay in Jerusalem on his way to Amman in August. Their reception by the prince was doubtless some consolation for the fact that he had cut Syria out of his programme. He explained that he could not on this occasion accept the deputation’s invitation to visit their country, but expressed the hope that he might do so in the near future. 73. Ibn Saud has also continued to cement his friendship with the Shaalan family. Following on arrangements for two matrimonial alliances, he sent cars to Damascus in October to bring back two grand-daughters of old Nuri Ash- Shaalan, destined to be the brides, one of the King himself, one of one of his sons, perhaps the Amir Feisal. It is understood that only one of these ladies came up to scratch, and that the other, a noted beauty, preferred a tribal lover. The less romantic of the two doubtless joined the circle of the King’s wives. It may be that his union with Nura’s daughter (see paragraph 123) was Feisal’s consolation prize. 74. The French Government conformed their action to that of His Majesty’s Government in the matter of the Hejaz Railway (see paragraph 62 above), but the French delegates would appear to have been sticky at the conference. 75. It may be added that the French Charge d’Affaires in Jedda again visited Sana early in February. Little political significance need be attached to these journeys, but it would appear that the two Powers are slowly negotiating a formal treaty of friendship. (3) Italy. 76. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Italy during the first half of 1935 continued to be marked by the new friendliness observed after the termination of the Saudi-Yemen War in 1934. In February it became known that the Italian Government had agreed to receive ten youths to be trained in aviation, not gratis, but on easy terms. Only four out of the first ten selected passed medical tests at Massawa, but a further batch were sent to Italy to complete the tale of ten. They seem to have proved, with one exception, incapable and to be a quarrelsome, undisciplined lot, but the Italian authorities still bear with them. 77. The Amir Saud left Jedda on the 14th May in an Italian ship, diverted from her course to embark him, and his first visit was to Italy. He was accom panied by the Italian Charge ‘d’Affaires. The prince arrived at Naples on the 19th May and at Rome on the 20th May. He was entertained with great honour, lunched with the King, was received by Signor Mussolini and witnessed one or two military displays. 78. Some business would appear to have been done during the visit. His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome learnt from a well-informed source that the Italian Government expressed three principal desiderata to Fuad Bey Hamza, namely, that Ibn Saud should discourage Senussi propaganda in the Hejaz, that he should help the Italians to recruit Arabs (presumably labourers) for Eritrea, and that he should regard the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia as a quarrel between Christian nations, in regard to which Saudi Aiabia should obsei\e neutrality. [13078] B 1079. Meanwhile, coming events had been throwing their shadow before in Jedda. In the spring the Italian Legation was strengthened. About the same time a gentleman named Odello set up in business in circumstances which, at the time, aroused no suspicion, though, if he had been as successful as he said else where, it seemed a little odd that he should choose Jedda as his headquarters. It became evident afterwards that, whether he was a merchant or a military officer, as he led the Saudi authorities to believe, he was an Italian Government agent. His camouflage, however, was excellent. He imported a family, including a wife and daughter, whom many have found attractive. He engaged quite seriously in several ordinary commercial enterprises, e.g., as a contractor for public works. He collected a fairly important Italian staff for a place like Jedda, but, with the exception of a temporary invasion of mechanics, &amp;c., in connexion with the consignment of arms to be mentioned presently, his employees were such as he might need for his ostensible business. 80. In July and August the Saudi authorities seem to have set their faces firmly against any recruitment of labourers or chauffeurs for Eritrea. Their attitude towards the export of cattle, sheep and food-stuffs varied then and later. Merchants in Jedda were themselves disillusioned by the fate of one consignment which was allowed. The consignment perished before labour was available to unload it at Massawa and as the merchants had contracted for delivery there, they had to stand the loss. Odello was busy trying to get camels and his name appeared in connexion with large Italian purchases of gold in the local market. 81. Further light was thrown on the situation on the 25th August when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin sought an interview with His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires. He spoke of the activities of Signor Odello, who had sought permission to recruit labour and to buy camels for Eritrea and who had been allowed to visit the King at Riyadh. He put various questions as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment towards the Italo-Ethiopian conflict and their views on the sale of camels to the Italians. In the course of subsequent interviews Mr. Calvert gave non committal replies based on instructions and was the recipient of further partial revelations of what was passing with the Italians. On the 19th September the sheikh expressed perturbation as to the possible outbreak of war and closing of the Suez Canal and as to the effects thereof on trade, &amp;c., in the Red Sea. 82. It was clear that the Saudis were anxious not to offend the Italians and were attracted by the high price they could get for camels, but were anxious also to do nothing to estrange His Majesty’s Government. For the rest, it was not easy to deduce the exact facts from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s statements. A collation of them with those made later by Fuad Bey Hamza, makes it pretty clear that the Saudi Government had committed themselves to supply or cause to be supplied some 12,000 camels at about three times the local market price plus certain taxes but that they were deliberately dilatory in carrying out the undertaking. So far as is known only 1,000 camels were actually exported under the Odello arrange ment, although others may have been bought in the north by persons anxious to supply an Italian demand for camels in Syria. The shipment by sea did not actually leave Yanbu until mid-November. 83. There was a new and important development early in October when a consignment of arms, &amp;c., and a party of nine or ten Italian mechanics, &amp;c., arrived in Jedda. The readiness of the Italian Government to supply arms had been mentioned by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert, but the sheikh protested in a further conversation on the 6th October that the actual arrival of a consign ment had taken the Saudi Government by surprise. His explanations sounded unconvincing, but it is possible that some at least of the high Saudi authorities were genuinely taken aback. Anyhow, the goods were not allowed to be cleared from customs until the 26th October and, though they were taken to Ashaira on the Riyadh road to be demonstrated, Fuad Bey afterwards assured Sir Andrew Ryan that they had then been sent back to Jedda to be kept under lock and key in the barracks. It should be added that, although the consignment seemed to be fairly important, it could be plausibly regarded as consisting only of “ samples,” the description given to it by the Saudis. Most of the Italian mechanics left Jedda on the 4th November. 84. Mr. Calvert’s conversations with Yusuf Yasin on the subject of Saudi- Italian relations eased off after the 6th October, although he remained in the[13078] B 11 21 Hejaz until after Fuad Bey Hamza’s return. It was not until the 29th November that a conversation between Fuad Bey and Sir Andrew Ryan in Riyadh put a more serious complexion on the whole business. Fuad Bey said that the Italians had now offered to give the Saudi Government £500,000 gold, or rather the equivalent of most of that amount in arms, the rest perhaps in cash, in return for half the original number of camels. He was positive that no other condition was attached to the offer. He expatiated on the King’s suspicions of the Italian policy but also on the danger of offending the Italian Government, unless the Saudi Government could look for support elsewhere. He stated three problems, as follows :— (1) If Italy menaced Saudi Arabia, could the latter count on the same support as had been accorded to Abyssinia? (It was fairly clear at the time and became even clearer afterwards that in Ibn Saud’s view Italian action in the Yemen would constitute such a menace no less than direct action against Saudi Arabia.) (2) If it were said that Saudi Arabia was not, like Abyssinia, a member of the League of Nations, would not the slavery settlement under negotia tion with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom make it possible for Saudi Arabia to enter the League ? (3) If the suggested Italian menace were in sight, could the Saudi Govern ment count on material support from His Majesty’s Government? 85. Fuad Bey explained that he was delaying his return to Jedda, in order to postpone his reply to the Italian offer until His Majesty’s Government should have had time to express their views. Their views were stated in a Foreign Office telegram of the 20th December. While His Majesty’s Government could obviously not reply definitely, much less in the affirmative, to Fuad Bey’s questions, the instructions enabled Sir Andrew Ryan to make a temporising statement, designed to dissuade the Saudi Government from throwing themselves into the arms of the Italians, when they met in Jedda on the 22nd December. Inter alia, he read the text of the fourth conclusion arrived at in the Anglo-Italian conversations in Rome early in 1927, to show, though naturally without any commitment, vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia regarding future British action, what strong grounds His Majesty’s Government would have for opposing any attempt by the Italians to establish themselves anywhere on the Red Sea coast of Arabia. Sir Andrew Ryan’s state ment seemed to produce a good effect. In order to enhance this he was authorised on the 31st December to communicate confidentially in writing to Fuad Bey all the conclusions arrived at in the Rome conversations having any bearing on the matter, i.e., paragraphs 2 to 4 of the record of the 7th February, 1927. 86. An interesting sidelight on the Odello business is the statement of a fairly reliable informant on the 15th November that Odello was pressing his higher authorities for permission to offer the Saudi Government money to pay off their debt to His Majesty’s Government, 87. Ibn Saud is probably sincere both in his suspicions of Italy and in his desire to avoid offending her. It is much more difficult to gauge the personal sentiments of other Saudi personages concerned in the above transactions and of such members of the Royal family as the King consults. The subject is too speculative to enlarge upon. It may be said that Sheikh \usuf \ asin seemed to be greatly impressed by the pecuniary advantage of selling camels and, unlike Fuad Bey afterwards, pretended that the camel deals were purely commercial transactions, to be allowed or disallowed by the Government, luad Bey is widely believed in the Hejaz to be hand and glove with the Italians, notwithstanding the strong assurances that he gave to Sir Andrew Ryan in Riyadh of his personal belief in the King’s policy of reliance on Great Britain. Both men have been accused of having received bribes or promises of personal gain from the Italians. Such accusations are lightly made in Arabia, and while they cannot be dismissed outright, it seems probable that both, and especially Fuad Bey Hamza, are more influenced by their ambitions as Arab nationalists than by the hope of profit. They are in close relations with the small minority of Nationalists in Palestine and Syria who have lent themselves to Italian propaganda. 88. As the King’s attitude has evolved, he has doubtless had to reckon increasingly with the widespread hostility of Arabs, with the exception of thesmall minority just mentioned, to the Italian aggression in Abyssinia. This hostility became articulate in the autumn even in places normally as spineless and self-centred as Jedda and Mecca. Trivial anti-Italian demonstrations were said, in October, to have provoked protests by the Italian Charge d’Affaires. On the Italian side, discretion was observed as regards local propaganda. The increased use of wireless sets has enlarged the number of people who can listen to news from abroad, although Jedda appears to be outside the range of the notorious Bari broadcasts, but the only overt sign of propaganda on the spot, which came to the notice of the Legation up to the end of the year, was the free distribution late in December of copies of a Libyan newspaper containing much glorification of the treatment accorded to Moslem institutions in Libya and a violent attack on British policy in Egypt. 89. The official attitude of the Saudi Government in regard to the war in Africa is one of neutrality, but it has been publicly defined only in the account in the Cairo newspaper Ahram of the 22nd October of an interview given to their correspondent in the Hejaz by “ a high and reliable person.” 90. The crisis has caused the Saudi Government to consider their position in regard to the League of Nations, a subject which is dealt with below. (4) 'Netherlands. 91. The Amir Saud visited the Netherlands in June just before proceeding to London, and enjoyed for a few days honours similar to those accorded to him in other capitals. The press published an interview given by Fuad Bey Hamza, the most interesting passage in which referred to a discussion Fuad Bey had had with the director of the Koninglikje Luchtvaart Maatschappij regarding the possibility of the company’s air service following a route across Saudi Arabia much shorter than the route across Persia. Fuad Bey was represented as having taken up a sympathetic attitude, but it was clear from his reaction to a mention of the matter at the Foreign Office on the 25th June that nothing definite had been arranged. 92. Nothing else of any importance came to light during the year in connexion with relations between Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands. The move ment of pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies showed a satisfactory increase, but the number was still far below that of a few years ago. 93. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires paid his annual visit to Sana early in February. He was accompanied by the Dutch engineer who had gone with him the previous year, and by a former manager of the Netherlands Trading Company in Jedda; but the visit seemed to be of less importance than that of 1934 (see paragraph 87 of the Report for that year). It may also be noted that early in the year M. Adriaanse was appointed to the additional post of Nether lands Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad, and left Jedda on the 22nd April to visit his new post. (5) Soviet Russia. 94. Saudi-Russian relations appeared to be at least as stagnant in 1935 as in 1934. Early in the year there were slight signs of a possible renewal of Soviet commercial interest in this country. The Soviet Minister was said to be cultivating the Saudi Minister of Finance, and the latter was said to be thinking of getting out of paying his debt to the Soviet by giving them special commercial facilities. A M. Guertik, calling himself “Agent General pour le Commerce de 1’U.R.S.S.,” was attached for some weeks to the Legation in Jedda. No visible result, however, ensued from his stay. 95. The Soviet Legation in Jedda went to pieces rather during the year. Only one vice-consul remained when the late Minister, M. Nezir Tourakoulov, left for good on the 15th December. Relations may be livened up on the arrival of his successor, M. Kerim Khakimov, who was consul in Jedda from 1924 to 1928, and seems to have been a remnant sort of person. 96. A Russian Moslem lady doctor, named Amina, entered the service of Ibn Saud in or about April, and after a stay in Taif proceeded to Riyadh, where she is still employed.97. Nothing definite came to light during the year regarding unavowed Communist activities in the Hejaz. It was reported in July that a Syrian, stated to be a convert to communism, was leaving for the Hejaz. There may be some little propaganda in places like Mecca and Medina, but it is unlikely to be important. 98. The automatic telephones mentioned in paragraph 89 of the last report would appear to have been permanently installed in the Royal palace at Tail. (6) Belgium. 99. The incident mentioned in paragraph 106 of the report for 1934 was liquidated by the formal appointment of Colonel Ibrahim Depui as Belgian consul in Jedda by a Royal decree dated the 30th January. Colonel Depui returned to Jedda early in 'the year, announced his appointment, and intimated that the head of the local Italian firm of shipping agents would act for him during his absences. He went of! again about the beginning of March and had not returned up to the end of December. His appointment can hardly be regarded as more than a personal scoop. There is no sign of its having led to any development in relations between Belgium and Saudi Arabia, although it was followed by a flood of commercial enquiries from Belgian firms. Colonel Depui may, however, be promoting Belgian commercial enterprise both in Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, which country he visited towards the end of the year. 100. The Amir Saud made a short stay in Brussels on his way from The Hague to London in June. (7) Egypt. 101. No visible progress was made in 1935 towards the establishment of normal relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. As non-recognition of Ibn Saud is a personal policy of the King of Egypt, it may be presumed that the comparative restoration of King Fuad’s health in the latter part of the year must militate against the termination of a preposterous situation. Meanwhile, even official circles in Egypt showed friendliness on various occasions during the year. The Saudi agent in Cairo was accorded customs exemption. High Egyptian personages paid him visits of congratulation after the unsuccessful attempt on Ibn Saud’s life, although no telegrams were sent direct to Mecca. The Egyptian Government as such sent over 100,000 bushels of wheat for the poor of Medina, and the Saudi Government agreed to a scheme for joint distribution, which, in the event, did not work very well. Courtesy was shown to the Amir Saud when he passed through Egyptian waters on his way to Italy, and still more when he stayed in Alexandria and Cairo, respectively, on his way to and from Amman at the end of his tour. The attitude of the Egyptian Government on the latter occasions was inspired, partly at least, by unofficial representations by His Majesty’s Government. In reporting conversations on the subject, the Acting British High Commissioner mentioned that the Egyptian Prime Minister had himself deplored the rancorous attitude of King Fuad, and stated that there was no longer any cause for the continuation of bad relations between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. 102. Unofficial relations were even more kindly. After the attempt on Ibn Saud’s life, Nahas Pasha sent a telegram to the King “on behalf of the people of Egypt.” The gift of the Egyptian Government to the poor of Medina had its counterpart in money subscribed privately by Egyptian sympathisers. One Cairo paper, the Balagh, stated towards the end of March that Ibn Saud had expressed to one of its representatives, who had recently been in Mecca, his readiness to give reasonable satisfaction to Egyptian desiderata, with a view to the establishment of official relations. The Balagh expressed the hope that Egypt would reciprocate and other press utterances were inspired by a similar hope. Above ajl Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group continued their activities, as described in paragraph 160 below, without reference to the absence of normal relations, and, it is known, with a strong desire to see such relations established. It may be said that the Banque Misr has to a large extent over shadowed the not very impressive new Egyptian consul, who arrived in Jedda about the beginning of June. [13078] b 12'24: (8) Turkey. 103. Mention has already been made of the suggestion, apparently originated by the Iraq Government, that Saudi Arabia should join in the proposed pact of non-aggression between Turkey, Persia, Iraq and perhaps Afghanistan. No definite information regarding the Saudi reaction to this ^ suggestion reached the British Legation in Jedda up to the end of the year, nor does it know of any important development during 1935 in the direct relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia. In October the Turkish Charge d’Affaires in Jedda claimed to have urged on the Saudi authorities the folly of lending themselves in any way to Italian schemes. 104. The chief preoccupation of the Turkish Legation throughout the year was the question of the effect of the Saudi real property legislation (see paragraph 198 below) on the interests of Turkish subjects, who in the past acquired such property in the Hejaz, as Ottomans legally entitled to hold it, but who are now aliens vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia. 105. In January there was an unconfirmed yarn about a proposed com mercial deal, which was supposed to have been discussed between the Turkish Charge d’Affaires and the Saudi Minister of Finance. (9) Persia. 106. See paragraph 103 above as regards the suggested Middle Eastern Non-Aggression Pact. For the rest, nothing worth mentioning came to light in 1935 regarding Saudi-Iranian relations. Some of Persia’s more academic claims not only to Bahrein and other islands in the Persian Gulf but to “ large parts of Arabia,” to quote a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran of the 2nd February, 1935, might affect Ibn Sand, if they were not academic. The Persian Government showed their sense of the unimportance of their relations with him by allowing their Minister in Jedda to fade away in May without announcing a departure on leave and by deciding in July that their Legation in Jedda should be made a branch of that in Cairo. After the late Minister’s departure it was run up to the end of the year by a solitary junior official. (10) Afghanistan. 107. The Afghan Minister in Cairo was appointed to the additional post of Minister in Jedda early in the year. Soon after the Afghan Government decided to make their Legation in Cairo a dependency of their Embassy in Angora and to confine the appointment of their late Minister in Cairo to Saudi Arabia only. This was intended rather as a slap in the face to the Egyptian Government than as a tribute to the importance of Saudi-Afghan relations. There is no sign that the Minister, an amiable Moslem pietist, has done anything to make these relations closer. The number of Afghan pilgrims in 1935 was about the same as in 1934, but much below the 1933 figure. 108. Ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan again came on pilgrimage in 1935, and was received with the honour due to a Poyal guest. His presence in Mecca provided the occasion for demonstrations of sympathy by his Afghan and Indian supporters. His stay in the Hejaz was, however, shorter and attracted less attention than that which he made in 1931. The Afghan Government showed no signs of perturbation. (11) Ethiopia. 109. Another Ethiopian mission, presenting a much more Ethiopian appearance than that mentioned in paragraph 99 of the report for 1934, arrived in Jedda in April, after first visiting Sana and concluding there a Yemen- Abyssinian Treaty of Friendship. Their stay in Jedda was short and they were understood at the time to have accomplished nothing in the direction of persuading the Saudi Government to negotiate a similar treaty with them. On the 25th August, however, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin intimated to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that some sort of negotiations had been proceeding since the visit of the mission. He spoke of their having been suspended pending a settle ment of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but in spite of this yet another Ethiopian mission arrived on the 31st October, having come overland from Sana, where25 they had exchanged ratifications of the Yemen-Abyssinian Treaty. These new arrivals made a long stay, during most of which they kicked their heels in Jedda waiting for Fuad Bey. They left finally on the 29th December, having apparently achieved this much result, that the Saudi Government, while unwilling, in view of the continued conflict between Italy and Ethiopia, to conclude anything in the nature of a formal agreement, intimated readiness to receive an Ethiopian consul in Jedda, and to extend to Ethiopian subjects the same treatment as that accorded to the subjects of Powers having treaty relations with Saudi Arabia. It was clear that the Saudi Government, while well enough disposed, were nervous lest, if they went further, they might expose themselves in the eyes of the Italians to the suspicion of taking sides in a quarrel, in regard to which they had decided to remain neutral (see paragraph 89 above). (12) United States. 110. United States interests in Saudi Arabia grew more important in 1935, owing to the continued activity of the oil concessionaires in Hasa and the American participation in the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragraph 156 below) which, although a British corporation, has some American capital and employs a certain number of United States citizens, including the promoter and general manager, Mr. Twitched. This gentleman told Mr. Calvert in October that he had taken up privately with the State Department the question of the appointment of a consul in Jedda. He seemed to hope that this might materialise, but no such appointment was made up to the end of the year. 111. Apart from the oil business, the most notable phenomenon in con nexion with Saudi Arabia and the United States has been the increasing number of visits paid to the former by members of the American Medical Mission in Bahrein, the chief of whom, Dr. Dame, has become persona gratissima with Ibn Saud. (13) Japan. 112. Reference was made in paragraph 103 of the report for 1934 to a report that the the Japanese Government proposed to appoint a consul in Jedda. Confused echoes of this were still heard early in 1935, but nothing happened during the year to suggest that the Japanese Government had ever meditated such a step. Some little attention was attracted in March by the visit to the Hejaz of four Islamised Japanese pilgrims, who had come on from Egypt. The matter was of possible interest in connexion with efforts by the Japanese Govern ment to pose as the friends of Islam in Japan, and to extend their influence among the Moslem populations of Central Asia, but the proceedings of the four pilgrims in the Hejaz, so far as they were known, afforded no ground for any suspicion that they had political motives. (14) Other Poivers. 113. There is practically nothing worth recording under this head, except that the Czechoslovakian Government were understood in December to be contemplating the appointment of the present head of the principal local firm of shipping agents, a Jeddawi of Persian extraction, as honorary consul or vice- consul in Jedda (cf. paragraph 106 of the report for 1934). (C) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 114. The reference made by Fuad Bey Hamza during the conversations in London in 1934 to the possibility of Saudi Arabia seeking membership of the League of Nations was not followed up in any of the Anglo-Saudi discussions during the first half of 1935, nor did Fuad Bey revert to the matter in his further conversations at the Foreign Office in the summer. It is significant that on the 1st July, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was in London at the same time as the Amir Saud and Fuad Bey, told Mr. Rendel that he proposed to urge the Saudi Government to apply for membership of the League. The Pasha did not seem to be discouraged by Mr. RendeFs not unsympathetic but guarded reaction, and his influence may have had something to do with the nextdevelopment, which occurred when Sir Andrew Ryan visited Riyadh in November. On the 28th November Fuad Bey broached the matter rather lightly by suggesting that, if the slavery negotiations described in paragraph 58 succeeded, the way might be paved for a Saudi application at Geneva. He spoke with admiration of the leadership which His Majesty’s Government had established during the recent proceedings of the League and of the support accorded to Abyssinia. 115. Next day Fuad Bey returned to the subject in the conversation recorded in paragraph 84 above. As there indicated, his language implied that the Saudi Government had in view the possibility of entering the League in order to enjoy the same advantages as Ethiopia, if they were confronted by an Italian menace. He again suggested that the promulgation of the proposed Saudi slavery regulations would overcome any difficulty that might arise at Geneva owing to the existence of slavery in Saudi Arabia, and he expressed the view, in which Sir Andrew Ryan expressed guarded personal concurrence, that the possible difficulty due to uncertainty of boundaries need not be regarded as insuperable. 116. In view of the indication thus given by Fuad Bey of the use to which the Saudi Government might hope to put the proposed deal with His Majesty’s Government regarding slavery, Sir Andrew Ryan referred the matter to His Majesty’s Government, who confirmed his view that slavery regulations, which might seem to His Majesty’s Government adequate to justify them in renouncing their right of manumission, would not necessarily satisfy the League as to the suitability of Saudi Arabia for membership. He explained this carefully to Fuad Bey on the 22nd December. Fuad Bey subsequently expressed readiness to go on with the slavery negotiations. He did not further define the attitude of the Saudi Government regarding the League. 117. Before the conversations in Riyadh took place, Fuad Bey had told Mr. Calvert on the 11th November that the Saudi Government had received a communication from the League regarding sanctions, and said it had caused perplexity. He again referred to this when speaking to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 28th November. His attitude then was that Saudi Arabia could not be expected to help the League unless she could reap the “ benefits ” it could confer. This subject was not pursued on either side. 118. It is not recorded in the Legation whether the Saudi Government were represented at the spring meeting of the Paris Office of Health, but the October meeting was attended by their Director-General of Public Health. Dr. Mahmud Hamdi Hamuda takes a long bow to Paris, and he seems to have drawn it freely in an account he gave of the Saudi sanitary organisation. He took part in various discussions which cannot be related here. It remains true that the Saudi Government are interested in international sanitary affairs, principally from the point of view of their desire to get rid of the measures agreed upon internationally to obviate dangers connected with the pilgrimage. In this connexion interest attaches to a long article in the Umm-al-Qura of the 19th April, 1935, entitled an “ Appeal to the Islamic Press.” It consisted of a diatribe against the quarantine arrangements imposed by “certain European authorities,” with special reference to the arrangements at Kamaran and Tor. 119. Apart from the developments described above, the attitude of the Saudi Government towards multilateral international affairs continues to be one of detachment. So far as the Legation is aware, they did not take part in any international conferences in 1935. Their indifference is illustrated by the fact that no replies were returned to two notes from the Legation regarding the Fourteenth International Housing and Town Planning Congress, which was to be held in London in July, and the synchronised conferences of various educational associations, which were to be held at Oxford in August. His Majesty’s Government were not concerned officially with the organisation of these gatherings, but, if the Saudi Government communicated direct with the promoters, which is improbable, they did not trouble to inform the Legation, which had brought the two matters to their notice. They acknowledged with politeness the receipt of copies of the proceedings of the Third International Locust Conference held in London in September 1934, and of a further survey of the locust outbreak in Africa and Western Asia in respect of 1934, compiled under the direction of the Economic Advisory Council. There is too much reason to fear, however, that even locusts in reality leave them cold.(D) Treaties. 120. The only instruments having any treaty character, concluded by the Saudi Government in 1935, would appear to be the two shown in the following table, in which the numbering used in previous reports is continued :— No. With. Place and Date of Signature. Nature and Subject. Place and Date of Exchange of Katifi- cations. Date of Entry into Eorce. Remarks. 41 Sudan Gov- e r nme n t Cable and Wireless (Ltd.) and Eastern Telegraph Co. (Ltd.) Jedda, April 17, 1935 Commercial agree ment regarding the external telegraphic communications of Saudi Arabia June 1, 1935 Not strictly a treaty instrument, but is included like the two agreements at No. 15 in appendix to Annual Report for 1931 q.v., as the Sudan was a party to it. Did not re quire ratification. Signed ad refer endum by His Majesty’s Min ister in Jedda on behalf of the Sudan Govern ment, who con firmed his signa ture in due course. 42 ilisMajesty’s Govern- ment in the United Kingdom acting on behalf of the G o v- ernmentof Bahrein Jedda, Nov. 16, and Mecca, Nov. 17, 1935 Two exchanges of notes regarding transit dues chargeable at Bah rein and connected subjects Nov. 17, 1935 The two British notes were written in Jedda and the Saudi notes in Mecca on the dates shown. 121. The arrangement with Ethiopia, mentioned in paragraph 109 above, is not included in the list, as it is understood that it was not embodied in a formal exchange of notes, but was the subject of a letter or letters taken back by the last Ethiopian mission. 122. The amended note in paragraph 112 of the report for 1934 need not be further amended, but it should be noted that Belgium must now be included in the list of Powers which have recognised Saudi Arabia, even if she had not previously done so in any other way, by the act of appointing a consul in Jedda (see paragraph 99 above). III.— Internal Affairs. General Situation. 123. The rumours of dissension in the Royal family, so prevalent towards the end of 1934, died down after one final effort of the scandalmongers, which was reported at the beginning of January. The King’s brothers, it was said, had all gone against him, and retired to a place some way from Riyadh owing to their unwillingness to accept the succession of the Amir Sand. To minimise the true gravity of this situation, the King’s supporters had put it about that all the fuss was due to rivalry between the Amir Feisal, the King’s second son, and his cousin Khalid, son of the Amir Muhammad, for the hand of another cousin, the daughter of the King’s favourite sister Nura. The heir apparent, is was said, was displeased because Khalid was already married to a sister of his own, whom he did not wish to see slighted, and at one moment in the discussions His Royal Highness slapped Khalid’s face. These tales are all doubtless exaggerated, but it is probable enough that there is some feeling between the King and his sons on the one hand and the King’s brothers and their families on the other. It was noticeable that, when Sir Andrew Ryan visited Riyadh in November, none of the King’s brothersmem 28 was in evidence. It may also be mentioned that late in the year Feisal was under stood to have married the daughter of Nura, and to have been disillusioned owing to the exigencies of his new mother-in-law. 124. It is also frequently said that hostility exists between the Amirs Saud and Feisal. This belief is plausible enough to deserve mention with the reservation that there is no concrete evidence of its truth. If Feisal, reputed to be the most intelligent member of the Royal family, is discontented with his inferior status, he puts a good face on it and shows great outward deference to his elder brother. The latter seems to have a good deal of prestige and may have enhanced it by his European tour. His departure from Jedda was unimpressive, but his subsequent movements were advertised in a way which may have stirred even the sluggish Hejazi imagination. Anyhow, there was much more fuss and festivity on the occasion of his return in August. As for the Amir himself, there are various evidences that his tour did much to widen his outlook. 125. These matters, however obscure most of the facts may be, are all the more worth recording as there were fresh rumours in Mecca in November that the King intended to abdicate in favour of the heir apparent, a possibility which has always to be borne in mind. If he took such a step it would probably be with the object of leading an easier life, while guiding his successor during the earlier part of a new reign. His health would afford no strong reason, as he seemed to be better in 1935 than in 1934. He took part in at least one war dance at Mecca and seems to have acquitted himself well, though the author of the report on the subject said that the King himself had remarked £ ‘ that he was becoming fleshy to manifest a graceful feat.” 126. The most spectacular internal event of the year was the attempt on the King’s life in the sacred precincts of Mecca. This has already been adverted to in paragraph 25 because of its importance in connexion with Saudi-Yemen relations, and various other aspects of it have been mentioned elsewhere. Little need be added here except that it afforded the opportunity for elaborately staged demonstrations of local loyalty in addition to the expressions of sympathy from abroad, and that it may have helped to enhance the prestige of the heir apparent, who played or was represented as having played a beau role. The incident occurred while his father and he were circumambulating the Kaaba on the morning of the festival which follows Pilgrimage Day. The prince came to the King’s assistance and received a wound on the shoulder. It was not apparently serious, but it was more serious than the injury sustained by the King, who was merely superficially peppered in the leg, probably by splinters struck from the marble pavement by the gun-fire of the guards. Two of the assailants were killed outright and another very soon after, while attempting to escape. There may have been a fourth but, if so, he got away. 127. So far as the situation in Saudi Arabia as a whole is concerned, this section must suffer at least as much as usual from lack of trustworthy informa tion. It may be said fairly confidentially that there was no serious unrest in the towns. Much attention was directed early in the year to the poverty-stricken condition of Medina, but less because of any increase in the poverty than because of the sympathy enlisted by reports of it in Egypt and echoed in some other countries, e.g., the Sudan and Malaya. There were signs in Mecca and Jedda of a struggle between extreme Wahhabism and laxity. The religious extremists tend gradually to lose ground in such places, and perhaps in the country as a whole, including even Nejd. Indeed, when Captain de Gaury crossed the peninsula from Jedda to Koweit in the summer of 1935 he formed the opinion that Wahhabism, as a religious driving force, was dead or dying. It is natural that the extremists should try all the more to assert themselves in centres like Mecca and Jedda, where the tendency to laxity, music and all that is greatest. One striking contrast illustrates the position. It was reported in June that an almost miraculous change had come over life in Mecca in the space of two months, so great was the new licence practised and tolerated; but in August the citizens were stated to be extremely agitated by a reinvigoration of the Committee of Virtue. 128. Even less can be said of the tribal situation, partly because little is heard except for such information as trickles over the borders of Transjordan and Koweit and partly because the King adjusts his policy towards particular tribes according to the demand* &gt;f particular situations. In 1935 the indications were29 fen that he was cossetting the Shammar and was hard on the Mutair and perhaps other tribes in the north-east of his dominions. Not much was reported about the great tribes further west, but it is probable that feeling is divided among the Ataibah, some of whom still resent the treatment by Ibn Saud of what was formerly the leading family, and especially its imprisoned head Sultan Ibn Humayd-bin-Bujad. Mention must be made in this connexion of reports in November which convinced the Political Agent at Koweit that two of the chiefs mentioned in paragraph 75 of the report for 1933 had died. 129. It was reported in June that chiefs of the Beni Atiya had been summoned to Medina to account for alleged irregularities in the distribution of subsidies granted to the tribe by Ibn Saud. The chief reports of really serious trouble related to the high mountains of Asir and Najran. Tribesmen in the mountains were said to have refused payment of taxes. The people of Najran were stated to have driven out a Saudi garrison of seventy men. r I he facts are, as usual, obscure, but punitive operations seem to have been undertaken ; the Governor of Jizan died, and rumour suggested that he had lost his life in the troubles. A new Governor, supposed to have been chosen for his military qualities, was appointed to Najran. 130. From information received in Jerusalem and Amman in the summer, it would appear that the quasi-independent Governor of Teima, Ibn Rumman (see paragraphs 115 ff. of the report for 1934) had composed his differences with Ibn Saud, and that the King had dropped his proposal to erect a wireless station at Teima. A later report in November stated that he was still trying to persuade Ibn Rumman to accept both the wireless station and a garrison. Whatever the truth about their relations, there were no signs of warlike developments during the year. 131. Mention was made in the introduction of the sort of amnesty proclaimed by Ibn Saud at the beginning of the year. The decree on the subject was published on the 25th January. It cancelled all measures hitherto taken to prevent various Saudi subjects from re-entering the country, and authorised their return subject to compliance with conditions, which were not stated. Although the word ‘ ‘ pardon ’ ’ was used, the terms of the decree, considered as an amnesty, were far from explicit. It looked as though it might affect persons who had remained abroad for general political reasons, e.q., certain members of the Shereefian family, rather than former rebels and persons implicated in active intrigues against Ibn Saud. In the event, however, certain persons in these two categories made their peace with the King and were received back into his fold. They included two relatives of the Ibn Humayd mentioned in paragraph 128, who passed through Koweit on their way back from Iraq in November, and at least three persons concerned in the conspiracies abroad, which attracted special attention in 1932. Two of these, Tahir-ad-Dabbagh and Abdur Rauf-as-Sabban, had been among the most active of the conspirators. They were welcomed back not merely with forgiveness but with great honour. Constitutional Development and Administration. 132. No constitutional developments took place in 1935. The stationary and somewhat indeterminate position described in paragraph 122 of the report for 1934 continues unchanged. The fact is that the characteristics of Nejd make it entirely unsuitable for any kind of constitutional government, and that the Hejaz is hardly less autocratically governed, despite the observance of certain constitutional forms. As regards the doubt expressed in paragraph 123 of the previous report, it would appear, not very certainly, from language used by Fuad Bey Hamza in 1935 that there is still theoretically a Minister of the Interior in the person of the Amir Feisal, notwithstanding the merger of the machinery of that Ministry in that of the Presidency of the Council. It matters very little. The King’s a King for a’ that, and Ministers are his most obedient, humble servants when it comes to anything at all important. 133. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs continued during the year to be a Syrian preserve, run for the most part by Fuad Bey Hamza and in his absence by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, under the nominal direction of the Amir Feisal and thesupreme direction of the King. At the very end of the year it was decided to appoint a Hejazi, trained in Egypt, as assistant or legal adviser to the Ministry. This may be a set-back for the Syrians, but it is too soon to judge. 134. Changes of personnel in the internal administration were numerous during the year. Few of them need be mentioned in a general report, but some interest attaches to the transfer from Jedda to Taif of the young Amir, Abdul Aziz-bin-Muammar, a descendant of the princely house of Ayaina, and the appointment in his place of an acting kaimakam. No reason was given for the reversion to the old-world and inferior title of kaimakam, which dates from Turkish times and was last borne by Ibn Muammar’s predecessor, a local commercial magnate. The most interesting feature of the affair is that it was widely rumoured that Fuad Bey Hamza was to become Governor, but to retain his position as Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs. The rumour was still going strong at the end of the year, but it had not been confirmed. 135. By far the most important change, however, was that produced by the death at the end of October of the redoubtable Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi, Governor of Hasa, a cousin of the King and his comrade in early adventures. He ruled his province with a firm hand, and his influence extended much further, notably to the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms. His eldest son, Saud, succeeded him as Acting Governor, and the King was understood to intend to confirm him in the post during his visit to Hasa in January. Saud is a man of about 35. He created a disagreeable impression on Sir Andrew Ryan when the latter passed through Hasa in November. It does not necessarily follow that he will make a bad Governor of Hasa. Mr. Philby speaks well of him. 136. Mention has already been made of the retention of the offensive Governor of Kaf, Salih-bin-Abdul Wahid; of the appointment of a new Governor to Najran; and of the death of the Governor of Jizan, whether from natural or unnatural causes. The new Governor of Najran is Ibrahim-bin-Nashmi, an old soldier who once played a role near the Transjordan frontier. He had not long before been appointed to Turaba, and his transfer to Najran was thought to be due to military necessities there. The effective Governor of Jizan would appear to be one Ibn Aqil, probably the same man who was placed in command of the Ikhwan at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. To take one other key post, it was hoped that Abdul Aziz-bin-Ibrahim, the arbitrary old Governor (or rather Acting Governor, as he theoretically acts for one of the King’s sons) of Medina, was being removed when he left his post in the spring; but he returned in due course. 137. Ibn Saud has shown a growing tendency to appoint commissions of enquiry, inspection or organisation during the last couple of years, to deal with affairs in the capital or in the provinces. These included in 1935 a mission to Hasa to investigate the proceedings of Sheikh Muhammad At Tawil, the Director of Customs, &amp;c., who was said to have fallen foul of Ibn Jiluwi and was certainly at loggerheads with the California Arabian Standard Oil Company; and yet another commission to deal with administrative problems in Asir. 138. There were signs in 1935 of an increase in the number of police posts in the Hejaz and of a plan to centralise police control in the hands of the Director-General of Police in Mecca. There may be some connexion between this and the decision mentioned in paragraph 19 to transfer the control of certain posts in the north from the recently created preventive organisation in Mecca to that of the local Governors. At first sight this looks like decentralisation, but it may well be that the idea is to increase the power of the Director-General of Police, even though he may work through Governors. The whole subject is the harder to size up as it is very difficult to tell policemen from soldiers in Saudi Arabia, although the authorities tend more and more to make a definite distinction. The salient point at present is the attempt to strengthen the police organisation under the Central Government. Among the measures announced was the establishment of a police school at Mecca, which was foreshadowed in the press in July and for which provision was made in a decree published on the 25th December.31 IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. Finance and Currency. 139. In the continued absence of budgetary or other reliable information, it is again impossible to give any precise account of the financial situation in 1935. It is certain that the Saudi Treasury lived as usual from hand to mouth, resorting to all the shifts described in previous reports. The King’s demands for remittances of gold to Riyadh were stated to be heavy early in the year. A further and very drastic cut was applied to all official salaries in June. On the whole, however, money for current expenditure seemed to be easier, thanks, no doubt, to the cessation of the strain imposed by the Saudi-Yemen war of 1934 and to the marked increase in the pilgrimage, which brought grist to the mill both directly and probably indirectly as well owing to its favourable effect on the import trade and, consequently, on the revenue from customs. The camel deal with the Italians also brought in some money, though not as much as if political considerations had not deterred the Government from exporting camels to Eritrea on a large scale. 140. The important local firm of Haji Abdullah Alireza and Co. obliged the Government on occasion, e.g., in connexion with the purchases of rupees mentioned below. Other firms may have done the same, and the Banque Misr probably again advanced money on the security of the quarantine dues to be collected by their associated shipping company on behalf of the Saudi Govern ment from Egyptian pilgrims. Another favourite device for anticipating future revenue by issuing drafts on customs to local firms to whom the Government owe money continued to be used. It is believed, however, that during 1935 such drafts were issued only to the more important importing firms and that they were made non-transferable. &gt; 141. The customs duty on various articles, of which the most important were petrol, artificial silk, tobacco and perfume, was reduced in May. It is interesting to note as an essay in sanitary policy that carbolic acid was exempted altogether. The only new taxes known to have been imposed were import duties and licence fees on wireless sets (see paragraph 200), which, though heavy in themselves, cannot be expected to produce much revenue in the near future. 142. No great importance can be attached to schemes to collect voluntary subscriptions for public purposes. Mention may, however, be made of the efforts of the Arab Aeronautical Society (see paragraph 189) and of a “piastre scheme ’’ on an Egyptian model, the principle of which would appear to be to collect small money for great purposes, the nature of which is not very clear. 143. The best hope for the future of Saudi finance lies in the prospect of revenue from the oil and mining concessions, which will be dealt with presently. 144. No further steps were taken to deal with the floating debt as a whole. Individual creditors probably managed to extract payments on account. The payments to His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India recorded in paragraph 65 were probably due more to a desire to please on the eve of the Amir Saud’s visit to England than to any intention of dealing systematically with the floating debt. 145. A marked feature of the currency situation was the appreciation of the Saudi riyal, which rose well above, and at times considerably above, the rates quoted in paragraph 135 of the report for 1934. It stood on the 1st April, 1935, at approximately 21 to the gold pound and continued to rise in value until it suddenly soared to about 14-| in the second week of July. This was followed by a rapid fall and rates remained fairly steady during the remainder of the year. They were approximately 17^ at the end of September and 18 at the end of December. 146. The reasons for these fluctuations are hard to analyse. The rise may have been due partly to hoarding in the uncertain world conditions of the summer,32 partly to an expansion in the legitimate demand for silver currency, e.g., for the purposes of the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. In any case there seemed to be a shortage of riyals, definite enough to perturb the Government, who decided to increase the circulation. They made enquiries in various quarters in July- August, asking the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate to advance 1 million riyals to be minted by the syndicate and addressing themselves also to the Royal Mint in England, which was asked to quote prices. No business was done in these quarters. It was not until early 1936 that the Legation learnt that an order had been placed in Birmingham, through the intermediary of the Banque Misr and the National Bank of Egypt, for 1 million riyals. These, it is said, will be similar in everything except the superscription to the Indian rupee and the present riyals may be withdrawn. This has not been confirmed up to the time of writing, but the report is of great interest in view of the other most remarkable feature, now to be described, of the currency situation in 1935. 147. During the period May to December the Saudi Government imported from India through Jedda about 2 million rupees intended principally for use in Nejd. The idea was to substitute this currency, which has the advantage of having a fixed relation to sterling, for the Maria Theresa dollar. The experiment seems to have had a considerable success. There is probably no ground for the belief entertained in some quarters late in the year that the rupee had been made the official currency of eastern Saudi Arabia, but when the Legation party passed through Riyadh in November the bulk of the silver used there consisted of rupees. The Maria Theresa dollar, though still in use, appeared to be in process of being ousted. The Saudi riyal was very unpopular, as it has always been outside the Hejaz. Economic Conditions and Development. General Economic Conditions. 148. There is no known change to report in connexion with economic conditions generally during the year. There were slight signs perhaps of slowly returning prosperity in Jedda and Mecca. Poverty in Medina attracted attention for the reason given in paragraph 127 above. Oppressive taxation was said to be creating distress and discontent in Hasa, where the increase in customs duty effected in 1933 has been keenly felt. The rains in the winter of 1934-35 were, however, plentiful and again promised well for 1935-36. This meant good grazing in most northern areas, throughout the year. The price of camels seems to have improved somewhat, thanks partly perhaps to the demand for animals to be sent directly or indirectly to Eritrea (see paragraphs 81 ff.). 149. The international crisis threatened twice at least to affect food prices in the Hejaz, once in the summer when the temptation to export live-stock, fruit, &amp;c., to Massawa seemed likely to deplete the market, and more seriously in September, when a nervous eagerness to hoard supplies caused a great increase in prices. On the first occasion little was actually exported, owing to the difficulty of obtaining Government permission and partly to the unfortunate experience of the exporters of the consignment mentioned in paragraph 80. On the second occasion the Government took drastic action in October to prevent profiteering, and enacted the formation of committees in various towns to control prices. The enforcement of this control was apparently abandoned in consequence of protests by merchants, but they were warned that it would be applied rigorously if prices again went up. The press announced on the 31st October that the cost of food-stuffs had been restored to normal, and claimed that prices throughout Saudi Arabia were now more favourable than abroad. Oil. 150. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company made considerable progress with their enterprise in Hasa during the year. Drilling continued in the Jebel Dhahran and oil was struck on or soon after 25th August. Since then oil has been won at the rate of about 100 barrels a day, but the complete success of this well as a commercial proposition appears to be hampered by factors too technical for a layman to explain at second hand but which nave to do, not with33 lack of oil, but with the relative position of layers of gas and petroleum. It is thought that there may be more manageable oil at a lower depth. Meanwhile, it is intended to start sinking a second well not far from the first. The position at the end of the year was that the prospects were promising, but that oil was still not being produced in commercial quantities. The company had had some trouble during the year with the Saudi Director of Finance, &amp;c., in Hasa, and some little labour trouble. The latter does not seem to have been serious, and the former was settled by the appointment of a separate official from the Hejaz to deal with their affairs. 151. Less is known of the other activities of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. They would appear to have restricted somewhat their general surveying operations during the latter part of the year. On the other hand, they were reported early in May to be negotiating for rights in a further area to the west of their original concession. It was at first suggested that they wished to secure this in substitution for part of the original area, but it seems more probable that they were acting under the option mentioned in paragraph 50 of the report for 1934, which referred not only to the Koweit neutral zone, but in very general terms to an area west of that definitely conceded in 1933. Some further light was thrown on the extent of the original area by a document which came confidentially to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government in 1935, and which purported to be the full text of the 1933 concession. There is no reason to doubt its authenticity, although, as it does not contain the famous option clause, it must be assumed that there was at least one supplementary agreement. 152. The main agreement just referred to defined the conceded area as consisting of “ all of eastern Saudi Arabia from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters) westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia,” subject to a definition of how the lines bounding the concession on the west should be drawn from the edge of the Dahana to the northern and southern frontiers. The company have, therefore, a very material interest in the result of the controversy between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government regarding Ibn Saud’s eastern frontiers. Should he make good his claim to the Jebel Nakhsh (see paragraph 57) they might hope to find oil in that district. Under the offers already made by His Majesty’s Government they would have rights in the strip of country adjoining the southern extremity of the Gulf of Bahrein on the west, where there is reason to think that oil may be discovered. 153. Little was heard in 1935 about oil prospects in the west of Saudi Arabia, except from Mr. Ydlibi, who, always an optimist, professed in April to have as good as got a concession for the whole of the western coastal area from south of Aqaba to the Yemen border, including the Farsan Islands. 154. The position in regard to a possible oil concession in the Koweit neutral zone is described in paragraph 50 above. As for other areas marginal to Ibn Saud’s eastern dominions, reference need only be made in this report to the indirect interest of Saudi Arabia in the concession granted by the Sheikh of Qatar on the 17th May, 1935, to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), and to the interest manifested by various persons and companies during the year in the oil potentialities in the Trucial sheikhdoms and Muscat and Oman. The position at the end of the year was that interests ultimately identical with those participating in the Iraq Petroleum Company had obtained prospecting options from the rulers of Ras-al-Khaimah, Dibai and Sharjah, and were hopeful of getting a similar option from the ruler of Abu Dhabi. It was intended that these options should be transferred to a new concern formed by the interests in question under the name of Petroleum Concessions (Limited). This company had in view the possibility of acquiring rights in a very extensive area from the Koweit neutral zone to Muscat and Oman, both inclusive. 155. The important oil development at Bahrein also affects Saudi Arabia, as the American interests concerned are the same as those behind the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Pending larger developments in Hasa, the enterprise there must be regarded as ancillary to that in Bahrein, and as havingmam 34 a considerable potential interest in arrangements for the distribution and marketing of Bahrein oil. Mining. 156. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited), of which some a account was given in paragraph 141 of the report for 1934, made considerable progress during 1935, thanks to the unbounded energy of its creator, Mr. Twitched. By the end of the year a complete mining camp had been brought into existence at the Mahd-adh-Dhahab or Cot of Gold, where there are numerous remains of old workings. The success of this mine seemed to be fairly assured, and it provided employment for most of the mixed collection of about twenty-five Americans and Europeans of various nationalities whom Mr. Twitched has recruited, as wed as for about 700 local labourers. The results obtained in other areas in 1935 were less definite, but at the end of December Mr. Twitched had made preparations to send well-equipped prospecting parties to the districts round Yanbu and Wejh, and to two others further inland. He has shown also a revival of interest in the Taif area, which was explored under his auspices in 1931-32 with apparently negative results. 157. The Mahd-adh-Dhahab was thought, in November, to lie approximately at the intersection of parallel 23° 30' and meridian 41° E. Its exact position is of some importance, as it was named as a marginal point in the definition of the area in which the syndicate obtained prospecting rights at the end of 1934. Some difficulty appears to have arisen between Mr. Twitched and the Government as to whether one at least of the inland areas which he wished to prospect lies inside or outside the boundary thus defined. 158. Another adverse factor which may give trouble is the hostility which the concession has aroused in certain quarters and which is partly inspired by real or alleged religious feeling over the “ sale ” of a great part of the Holy Land by Ibn Sand to “ the British.'’ The King’s brothers were said early in the year to be greatly annoyed by his having granted the concession. The fanatic Governor of Medina has shown himself sticky. There has been a campaign against the concession in India. The King may be expected to stand firm, but, if the enemies of the concession, who are not ad animated by religious sentiment, succeeded in stirring up tribal animosity, the operations of the syndicate might wed be hampered. 159. The syndicate opened an office in Jedda in October and started work in December on a large compound about a mile outside the town. A pier is to be built on the coast opposite this compound. Work was wed advanced at the end of the year on a direct road from Jedda to the mine, which is at present difficult of access. The new road, which should be about 230 miles long, is not elaborately planned, but it is hoped to get easy gradients to facilitate transport. The most difficult part has still to be made. Other Projects. 160. Various other projects were canvassed during the year. Some of the smaller are not worth mentioning. Most of the larger are not new, but may derive an impetus from the energy of Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group. Talaat Pasha was credited with interest in so many enterprises at the beginning of 1936 that it is hard to know what he has in view. Among the projects in which he seemed to be most immediately interested were schemes for the provision of electricity and a house-water supply in Mecca and an air service between Jedda and Medina. He had also shown interest in the possibility of making modern roads to Mecca and Medina, but expense was a deterrent. He does not seem to be interested in the scheme for a Jedda-Mecca railway, of which there was further talk during the year. Mr. Ydlibi spoke hopefully in April of getting this concession, and a French group were also thought to be after it. There was also talk of a new condenser at Jizan, for which Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. quoted a price in the autumn.35 9 . 161. Urban development is promised in Jedda and Mecca, new boulevards for the former, a new park for the latter. The chief addition to Jedda in 1935 was a new customs building and work was well advanced at the end of the year on new buildings on the “ quarantine quay ” close by. The contract for the latter was given to the Italian Odello, mentioned in paragraphs 79 ff. above. One electrical plant presented by an Indian notable was installed in the sacred precincts at Mecca during the year. Certain steps seem to have been taken to repair the mosque at Medina and to restore to some extent the tombs there, the desecration of which by Wahhabi fanatics had outraged the feelings of many Moslems. Communications, Roads and Ports. 162. Mention has already been made in paragraph 160 of the revival of the idea of a railway (or tramline) between Jedda and Mecca, and in paragraph 62 of the position in regard to the Hejaz Railway. No other railway development is in sight. 163. As regards motor transport, the only important addition to be made to paragraphs 144 and 145 of the report for 1934 is that in May the Government promulgated a decree enacting the creation of a single company to take the place of the four existing companies working under Government auspices and the much larger number of private transport concerns. The new company was to be divided into two sections corresponding respectively with the four Government companies and the former private concerns. It was to take over the rolling-stock of the various private firms at a valuation in return for shares in the combine. Many details of the scheme were obscure. Later in the year the new arrange ment did not seem to be working very happily, but a better judgment of it can be formed when it has stood the test of the 1936 pilgrimage season. 164. The road system is still most primitive. It cannot be too often repeated that what is called a road in Saudi Arabia is merely a practicable track over which cars bump or bowl according to the character of the natural surface. Saudi road-making consists in making such tracks a little more practicable. It was intended after the 1935 pilgrimage to improve the worst part in Saudi territory of the track between Nejef and Medina (see paragraph /), but it is not known whether this has been done. Mention was made in the local press of other minor projects to improve existing roads and strike out one or two new ones. A report from Transjordan for May mentioned road-making activity in the north of Saudi Arabia. A passing reference may be made in this connexion to an experimental journey by cars made by certain merchants of Damascus to the Hejaz just after the 1935 pilgrimage to explore the possibility of regular motor services. The general conclusion would appear to have been that the country is too difficult and the time taken too long for the idea to be feasible. 165. Foreign enterprise has done a little to stimulate interest in road making of a more modern type. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate s road, mentioned in paragraph 159, will probably mark an advance in this direction, although it is not ambitiously planned. I he interest of Talaat Pasha Haib m the subject has been adverted to in paragraph 160, but, as there stated, expense is likely to be a great deterrent. It is difficult to form estimates, but it seems probable that it would cost not less than £1,000 a mile to make asphalted roads to Mecca and Medina, and it might well cost a good deal more. Talaat Pasha does not seem to have been encouraged by the results of one small experiment just outside Jedda, where he had a few hundred yards of asphalted road laid during the year under review. 166. There is no port work to record, except the construction by the California Arabian Standard Oil Co. of a small pier for their own use at Akhbai (Khobar) on the coast near their oil well at Dhahran, and the intended construction of a pier north of Jedda by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (paragiaph loJ). The improvements at Jedda mentioned in paragraph 161 are on land only.36 167. There has been little change since 1934 in the communications of the Hejaz by sea. The following general return for the last two years shows a certain increase in British shipping relatively to the figures for previous years :— 1934. 1935. With cargo. In ballast. With cargo. In ballast. Entered— No. Tonnage. No. Tonnage. No. Tonnage. No. Tonnage. British ... 188 261,271 11 31,018 197 299,104 4 2,602 Saudi 6 814 10 114 5 375 Other flags 93 206,279 12 55,696 80 182,208 24 61,673 Cleared— British ... 114 114,623 85 177,666 107 120,413 94 181,293 Saudi 7 707 8 1,146 1 75 4 300 Other flags 4 7,863 101 254,112 9 16,317 95 227,564 168. The Arabian Steam Navigation Company mentioned in paragraph 149 of the report for 1934 showed no signs of extended activity. The company’s second ship, never returned, but the other vessel, Al Fath, made occasional trips to Jizan with military supplies and personnel and did a certain amount of coastwise trade as well. The smaller ships of the Misr Navigation Company (see paragraph 150 of the report for 1934) called fairly frequently at Jedda during the year. 169. The increase in the numbers of pilgrims was reflected somewhat in the shipping. The Mogul Line ran a new ship specially designed for pilgrim traffic, the steamship Islami, and she made a number of voyages during the year, providing a marked improvement in accommodation for all classes of pilgrims. The Zemzem, of the Misr Navigation Company, mentioned in paragraph 150 in last year’s report, was joined for the pilgrimage season by the steamship Kawsar, specially built for the transport of emigrants from Europe to South America. These two ships made four voyages in all from Suez to Jedda. Posts and Telegra'phs. 170. The organisation of inland postal services appears to make slow progress, but little information on the subject is available. As regards external services, arrangements were made between the postal departments of the Saudi Government and of the Government of India at the end of 1934 for a daily mail service between Bahrein, on the one hand, and Hofuf and Qatif on the other, to replace a previous weekly service. This arrangement was to come into force on the 25th February, 1935. In June the Saudi Government approached His Majesty’s Government regarding a proposed postal service between Jizan and Kamaran, apparently overlooking the fact that they had raised the same question in 1931 and received a favourable reply (see report for 1931, paragraph 40). The renewed request was again acceded to in principle, and the practical arrange ments prepared by the postal department of the Government of India were conveyed by the Legation to the Saudi Government on the 31st October. The important subject of external telegraphic communications has been dealt with in paragraph 63 above. 171. It only remains to add a few odd scraps of information. The internal wireless service continues to work satisfactorily, and two new stations seem to have been established since 1933: one at Makhlaf in Najran in the summer of 1934, and another at Al-Majma’a in Nejd in July 1935. As already stated, the automatic telephone sets presented by the Russian Government in 1934 remain installed in the King’s palace at Taif. An extra telephone line was laid to Taif. It was announced early in October that a committee under Sheikh Khalid-al- Qarqani had been appointed to review the work of the Saudi Department of Posts and Telegraphs since its inception. Complaints reached the Legation regarding alleged abuses in connexion with money orders and remittances of cash received from abroad, but it was difficult to determine how far there was real ground for them.37 Commerce. 172. The absence of official statistics makes it as difficult as in previous years to deal with this subject. The general economic survey in contemplation for some time past (see paragraph 152 of the report for 1934) is still in course of preparation and will review the available information more fully than is possible in this report. 173. Generally speaking, it may be said that the year witnessed a further modest step towards economic recovery. Chiefly owing to the increased pilgrimage, greater activity has been reported in the local markets. Both Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited), and Messrs. Sharquieh (Limited) are believed to have completed a satisfactory year on closing their books after the 1935 pilgrimage. In the latter part of the year a less healthy stimulus was given to trade by the effects of the war in East Africa. A reaction is to be feared early in 1936, and may prove unpleasant to those who have incautiously yielded to the local propensity to lay in excessive stocks. 174. Imports for the year 1353 a.h. (ending the 4th April, 1935) are stated by a competent observer to have been about 10 per cent, greater than the previous years as regards quantities, although in value they remained much the same at about £1 million gold. 175. The chief articles of merchandise imported into this country, and their countries of origin, are as follows :— Piece-goods .—Japan supplies possibly 80 per cent, with the United Kingdom and India supplying small quantities, the Manchester product being of better quality. Petroleum .—Egypt and the Sudan and small quantities from the United Kingdom. Rice .—The bulk of requirements are supplied by Rangoon, with Calcutta also shipping certain quantities. Sugar. —Belgium, United Kingdom, Czechoslovakia, Java and Egypt share the market. Flour .—France is the largest supplier and small quantities are received from Iraq, India and Australia. Cement .—Is imported from Belgium, Yugoslavia, Italy and Egypt. Coffee .—From East Africa and the Yemen. Tea .—From India, Java and Ceylon. 176. The Saudi Government continued to import a large portion of their own requirements, employing for the purpose the local firm of Haji Abdullah Alireza and Co. This led to complaints from other merchants, and on one occasion a protest regarding a consignment of rice caused a somewhat wider distribution of Government favours to soothe the malcontents. The Government imported no large quantities of arms, but see paragraph 185 below as regards samples. 177. Sharqieh (Limited) continued to have the lion’s share of the importa tion of motor vehicles, under the Ford monopoly described in paragraph 156 of the report for 1934, but Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. imported in 1935 fifteen Chevrolets and three Buicks. Sharqieh (Limited) have had to adapt their arrangements with the Government to some extent to the new situation caused by the creation of the transport monopoly described in paragraph 163 above. There was some discussion in the summer about a possible contract for supplying the petrol requirements of this monopoly, but nothing definite was arranged. The Egyptian Shell Company supplies the bulk of the Government requirements, and a proposal to give the contract for supplying the monopoly to the producers of an American brand, Citex, apparently fell through owing to the expense of insuring against war risks. 178. A small but growing trade in wireless sets has sprung up as a result of the legislation to be described in paragraph 200 below. Cheap sets of American and Dutch manufacture, imported direct or through Egypt, are mostly in demand.179. The export trade of Jedda continues to be negligible. That of Yanbu was increased in 1935 by the export of 1,000 camels at the high price of £15 gold or more to Eritrea in the circumstances described in paragraph 82 above. 180. Information regarding outlying areas is even more meagre. The Italian demand seems to have given some stimulus to the export of camels overland to Syria. The briskness of the trade across the Transjordan frontier has been noted in paragraph 21. Native butter, dates, hair-tents and live-stock would appear to be the chief exports, while silk goods, cotton goods and cereals are imported from Transjordan. An Amman estimate puts the total of such imports for the year 1934-35 at £P. 10,000. Prosperity in Nejd, following on good rains, is said to have been reflected in increased activity in the bazaars of Piyadh. Those of Hofuf also presented a busy appearance, when visited on a market day by Sir Andrew Ryan and Captain de Gaury. V.— Military and Naval Organisation. 181. Ibn Sand is credibly reported to have boasted at Riyadh in the autumn that it would be useless for him to engage in vast expenditure on military organisation. He had, he said, reduced even the greatest tribal sheikhs to such submission that they would fight his battles at command, even providing their own supplies. He could disband their forces at will on the termination of a campaign with or without reward. It is doubtless true that for warfare he would at any time in the near future rely on levies as he did in 1934 (see paragraph 158 of the report for that year), and that he has no intention of introducing any new military organisation into Nejd. 182. On the other hand, the King appears to have accepted the view that for the consolidation of his power, especially in outlying parts of his enlarged dominions, he needs more in the way of forces organised on something resembling European lines than he has had before. Levies may be all very well for war, but they can neither be turned out easily nor used to advantage for the more prosaic work of policing turbulent areas and supporting tax-gatherers. There was a definite move in 1935 in the direction of expanding and organising the regular forces. The known facts are meagre and disconnected, and they are the harder to co-ordinate because of the difficulty of discriminating clearly between the military reorganisation and the police reorganisation mentioned in paragraph 138 above. Before enumerating them it should be said that the appointment of the Minister of Finance to the additional post of Deputy Minister of Defence seems to have meant more than might be inferred from paragraph 159 of the Report for 1934, in which it was recorded; and that a part has been played by professional soldiers, including Muhammad Sadiq, who defended Jedda for the Hashimites when Ibn Saud besieged it and subsequently intrigued against the new regime abroad, but who was one of the first to return under the amnesty of January 1935. 183. It was announced in May that the existing camel corps was to be abolished and absorbed into the ordinary military and police forces. About the same time measures, of uncertain scope, were taken to collect arms and ammunition from outlying places, apparently with a view to storing them centrally at Mecca or perhaps at Taif, which seems more and more destined to be the main military centre in the Hejaz. Serving troops in the Northern Hejaz were called upon to wear a kind of European uniform, with the option of dismissal, which some of them preferred to wearing trousers. Troops intended to be embarked for Jizan or Qunfida were seen in Jedda in new green uniforms in September. These various measures would appear to have been taken in anticipation of a general scheme of reorganisation, which was reported to be still under the King’s consideration in August. It was mentioned at that time that he wished to organise artillery and to have men trained on modern lines in the use of machine guns. 184. At least one of the military schools mentioned in paragraph 159 of the last report seems to have duly come into existence, but in June the Sadiq Bey mentioned above spoke with contempt of “the present military school ” and hoped that he might himself be put in charge. A later report spoke of 100 students being trained, but whether as officers or men did not appear. In this connexion39 mention may be made of a report from His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad dated the 6th November, recording information to the effect that five vacancies were being reserved for Saudi cadets in the Iraqi military college, but that it was not certain that they would be filled. Nothing of this has been heard otherwise in Jedda, although the local press referred to the main subject of Sir A. Clerk Kerr’s despatch, viz., the arrangements made for the training of Yemeni officers in Iraq, and has since mentioned a report that the King of the Yemen had asked the Iraqi Government to provide five retired officers and ten instructors for employment in the Yemen. 185. No important addition is known to have been made to the armament of Saudi Arabia in 1935, but the Government are probably considering the matter as samples are known to have been submitted by various firms. Two machine guns, believed to come from Czechoslovakia, were imported for demonstration purposes in May. Other samples of arms were submitted by the Steyr Solothurn A.G. of Zurich and Messrs. Unceta and Co. of Guernica in Spain. Vaguer and not very reliable information has come to hand regarding intermediaries who may be concerned in armament transactions. An account has been given in paragraph 83 of the most important development, that of the Italian offer of arms, &amp;c., to the Saudi Government. 186. There is nothing to add to the report for 1934 regarding the insigni ficant but not valueless naval forces of Saudi Arabia. As stated in paragraph 168 above, the one vessel of the Arabian Steam Navigation Company has been used for military transport. VI. —Aviation and Connected Matters. Saudi Air Force. 187. The main base of the Saudi air force was transferred to Taif early in the year and from February on the aircraft were seen only occasionally in Jedda. There was no change iii regard to the small number of available aircraft, consisting of two usable Wapitis and a possible third; nor in the general character of the personnel, although it cannot be said with certainty that the composition of the White Russian party remained exactly the same. A good sized aerodrome is stated to have been provided at Taif but it is probably as elementary as those which exist at Jedda, Yanbu and Wejh and at one or tw r o places on the Persian Gulf coast. 188. The most important development of the year was the despatch to Italy of the ten students mentioned in paragraph 76. The first party were seen off from Mecca with much clapping and floral tributes. The opinion formed of them in Italy has already been described. Ibn Baud himself expressed a very low opinion of their progress in conversation with Captain de Gaury in July. He was prepared to have to wait some considerable time before they could be made efficient, but he spoke of eventually using the two best of them to run a weekly air mail between the Persian Gulf and the Red bea, via Riyadh and laif. Early in 1936 the Saudi Government were said to be contemplating the purchase of two new aeroplanes, presumably for this purpose, but not to have decided on the make. 189. The decision to send students to Italy was accompanied by a spirited attempt to revive the “Arab Aeronautical Society, a private association with strong official backing, founded in or about 1931.’ Nothing had been heard of this since early in 1932 and little has been heard of it since the pilgrimage season of 1935, in the course of which certain important pilgrims were among the contributors to its funds. Other Aviation. 190. One of the events of the year was the despatch from Cairo to Jedda, by arrangement with the Saudi Government, of a R.A.F. Victoria to convey His Majesty’s Minister to Egypt in June, so that he should reach London in time for the Amir Sand’s visit. No other foreign aeroplanes visited the Hejaz, but one of Talaat Pasha Harb’s dearest schemes (see paragraph 160) is to organise air services for pilgrims, beginning with a service between Jedda and Medina. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have an aeroplane in Hasa for survey40 work, &amp;c. The Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate were considering at the end of the year the importation of one into the Hejaz. Thus, while there was little concrete achievement in the way of flying in 1935, the idea of introducing it was very definitely catching on. Arabian Air Route. 191. The position in regard to facilities for British aircraft, service and civil, to land on the Hasa coast in case of emergency is described in paragraph 60. Alleged Violation of Saudi Territory. 192. As stated earlier the Saudi Government did not follow up during 1935 the intimation which was mentioned in paragraph 168 of the Report for 1934 that they wished for a final settlement in regard to forced landings in their territory and similar incidents. In January they struck out a new line by putting forward claims to a total amount of about £300 for a refund of expenditure said to have been entailed by assisting and searching for British aircraft in two of the cases mentioned in the same paragraph of the last report. The claim in respect of one of the incidents seemed very inflated but it was considered politic to pay both. 193. The number of new incidents recorded in 1935 was happily very small. The British authorities concerned rebutted two complaints by the Saudi Govern ment that Saudi territory was flown over in the neighbourhood of the Trans jordan frontier on the 2nd March and 16th August. It was feared in Trans jordan on the 2nd July that a missing aeroplane might have strayed into Saudi territory, but news that all was well reached the Legation quickly enough to enable a note to the Saudi Government to be cancelled. A R.A.F. flying boat, which was forced to alight off the Hasa coast on the 16th September, had to shelter in thp lee of Ras Tanura while assistance was sent. An immediate notification was addressed to the Saudi Government on receipt of this information and thev reacted amiably. VII.— Press. 194. The two Mecca weeklies the Umm-al-Qura and the Saut-al-llejaz continued to be the only newspapers, with the possible exception of periodicals of purely religious interests, appearing in Saudi Arabia. The former has changed its editor, at least provisionally, and the latter is now owned by some sort of a company. Both are, however, so much under the thumb of the Govern ment, especially the Umm-al-Qura, which is to all intents and purposes owned by them, that changes of this kind make little or no difference. In the autumn of 1935 the Umm-al-Qura had the enterprise to produce a daily supplement giving wireless news about the Italo-Ethiopian war. 195. Except for occasional articles by Mr. Philby, such Saudi Arabian nows as penetrated to Europe was again for the most part derived from the press of other Arab countries and Egypt. Such news is rarely of much value. The Cairo Ahram has a correspondent in Jedda, but no other foreign paper has any machinery for obtaining trustworthy news other than that which is allowed to appear in the Mecca papers. VIII.— ^Legislation. 196. It is as hard as ever, for the reasons indicated in previous reports, to sift satisfactorily the medley of regulations, decrees, communiques, &amp;c, which may be regarded as having a legislative character. A good many of those published in 1935 related to matters mentioned elsewhere in this report like the amnesty for exiles, the prolongation of the period for submitting proof of foreign nationality, and various economic, financial and administrative matters. These need not be further dealt with in this section nor is it necessary to include in it certain minor legislative acts of little interest or importance to foreigners. The following paragraphs describe briefly the most important legislation of a general nature.41 197. Public Health and Medical Matters. —The most important enactment, so far as foreign interests are concerned, was the regulation on doctors, &amp;c., employed by foreign Governments and dispensaries maintained by them, which has already been mentioned in paragraph 64. The Public Health Department was, however, very active generally in the legislative domain. Revised regulations abrogating those previously in force were published on the 15th November regarding the practice of medicine, dentistry, veterinary surgery and midwifery. A still lengthier regulation regarding pharmaceutical chemists appeared on the 29th November and 6th December. A very voluminous further regulation on the control of sanitary affairs generally, the running of hospitals, &amp;c., was being published by instalments at the end of the year. An earlier decree published in August sanctioned the creation of “ the National Humane First Aid Society of the Saudi Arab Kingdom.” It is of interest in view of what was said in paragraph 153 of the report for 1933 to note that two of these enactments were described as “laws,” the Arabic word (“ qanun ”) being that formerly used by the Turks for major legislative acts of the sovereign authority. 198. Real Property. —The regulation mentioned in paragraph 174 of the report for 1934 continued during 1935 to cause agitation among the two principal classes of property owners, whose interests it threatened to affect, viz., those who, in spite of their being foreigners, had been allowed as Moslems to acquire property under previous regimes, and those who lawfully acquired property in the past when they were Ottoman subjects, but who had since become aliens vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia. An interpretative communique issued in January was intended to reassure the interested parties, but it was the result of a compromise between conflicting views in high Saudi quarters, and it did little to clarify the situation, which remained confused throughout the year. Nothing was, in fact, done to deprive owners in the first category of their property. As for those in the second, the position in regard to Hashimite properties was thought to have been satisfactorily settled by the correspondence mentioned in paragraph 23. The foreign Government most concerned in the generality of cases was that of Turkey, although the subjects of other States which have emerged from the old Turkish Empire are also interested, e.g., Syrians and Iraqis. The Turkish Legation in Jedda was still seeking satisfaction at the end of the year. A notice published by the Ministry of Finance on the 15th November dealt with one particular group of properties, in which only Turks are thought to be interested, viz., ruined properties outside Taif. It seemed to be inspired by a rather more liberal spirit than the regulation of 1934. It required owners to produce their title-deeds within a year, failing which the Government would repair the buildings at the expense of the properties and would be entitled to let them; but some protection was afforded to owners making good their title within fifteen years of the expiration of the notice. As British interests have not been effectively injured so far, this brief summary of a very complicated business must suffice. 199. Pilgrim Ships. —The regulation mentioned in paragraph 176 of the report for 1934, which was published on the 25th January, 1935, does not seem to have produced much practical effect. At any rate, it did not interfere with the usual arrangements of the Legation for dealing with pilgrims returning to their homes. 200. Wireless. —A regulation dated the 29th January, 1935, dealt with the use of receiving and transmitting wireless sets, the import duties and licence fees payable thereon, &amp;c. This was communicated to the foreign missions in Jedda in order to enable them to obtain licences for their existing sets in advance of the publication of the regulation. In the event the Saudi Government apparently thought it wiser not to publish it at all, but it was brought into force so far as its only provisions of practical importance in present conditions were concerned. Receiving sets were allowed to be imported and installed in authorised areas, which included Jedda, but not Mecca. No transmitting sets are known to have been imported under the new arrangements. Another regulation, embodied in a communique of the 12th July, prohibited the use of wireless by ships in Saudi territorial waters. His Majesty’s Government decided to assume that this did not apply to warships, but they drew attention to the omission of any provision for the case of ships in distress. The Saudi Government readily saw the point, and excepted such cases by a further communique published on the 20th Decemboff• ,201. Passes for Use on Land Frontiers .—“ Regulations concerning Emergency Passes for Travelling by Overland Routes ” were published on the 26th April. This was probably a consequence of the increased importance of overland motor routes, but the regulations were more general in form and established a simple procedure for the issue of passes instead of passports to Saudi subjects crossing all land frontiers. 202. Commerce. —A. notice issued by the Ministry of Finance on the 26th April required persons forwarding goods from Mecca to places in the interior to produce a certificate showing that customs duty had been paid on them. A communique published on the 20th June specified ports north and south of Jedda at which sailing craft were allowed to call, and stated that such craft calling elsewhere on the coast would be regarded as engaged in smuggling. 203. Private Cars .—The Ministry of Finance announced on the 3rd August that owners of private cars must submit monthly statements of all petrol, &amp;c., consumed and tyres, spares, &amp;c., used, supported by invoices and receipts to be furnished by the supplier. The object appeared to be to prevent the illicit sale of the new transport monopoly’s stores, but the regulation is said to have proved difficult to enforce, one factor being that quite high personages are said to be interested in the illicit sales. 204. Sale, Sec., of A rms .—A regulation published on the 31st October laid down stringent rules in regard to the sale, carrying and possession of arms and ammunition, which, if applied, would effect a considerable disarmament of the urban population. Bedouin and others not holding permits to carry arms were to deposit them on entering any town, and persons coming into the country across frontiers were to deposit them at the first police station in the frontier zone. The effect, on paper, anyhow, would appear to be that tribesmen from over the border might find themselves disarmed and face to face with Saudi tribesmen carrying arms, of which the Saudis would be dispossessed only on entering a town. Sporting guns were to continue to be governed by old regulations. 205. Among the minor regulations issued were one imposing a speed limit of 20 kilom. per hour in towns, under penalty of flogging for the first two offences and withdrawal of driving licence for the third; and an elaborate regulation on the crafts of embroidery and needlework. More general interest may attach to a decree creating a committee to look after the maintenance of monumental stones,” but, unfortunately, the announcement published in December gives no further particulars. IX. —Education. 206. Very little can be added to the account given in paragraphs 160 ff. of the report for 1933 and the short supplement in paragraphs 180-181 of the report for 1934. The new school at Mecca, for Javanese and Malay students, which was mentioned in the latter report, was duly opened and efforts were made to enlist in its favour the interest of possible benefactors in the Dutch Fast Indies and Malaya. I he press mentioned during the summer the opening of two new private schools in Medina and of two Government primary schools at Maala and Shibayka. A more interesting fact, mentioned about the same time, was the opening of a new school at Riyadh, intended primarily, or exclusively, for the education of the younger members of the Royal family. Later in the year it was announced that a commission had been appointed to inspect the Directorate of Public Instruction and to study the educational position generally. 207. It appears that since 1931 the founder of the Falah schools at Mecca and Jedda (see paragraph 161 of the report for 1933) has been unable to provide for them unaided. Efforts to help them out by collecting private subscriptions were followed in 1935 by the adoption of a scheme, suggested by the local merchants themselves, for collecting a surtax of half a piastre miri on every packet of imported goods for the benefit of the schools and a girls’ school maintained in connexion with them at Jedda. The merchants were to be entrusted with the collection of this tax and the administration of the proceeds.43 208. One of the local papers mentioned on the 29th October a proposal to introduce the study of English into the Saudi Institute (see paragraph 161 of the report for 1933) and to engage a teacher. English is already taught to some extent in Mecca, mostly by Indians. X.— Public Health. 209. This new section is introduced into the present report, more or less fro forma, with the object of drawing attention to a subject of growing importance, which might well be dealt with at greater length in future years, if it should be possible to reduce the volume of other sections. In the meanwhile, those interested will find much information in the recent pilgrimage reports compiled by the Legation. 210. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the Saudi authorities have shown some real inclination to improve their public health arrangements, but they are so hampered by incompetence and financial stringency that they have done nothing to justify the glowing accounts which they give abroad, e.g., to the Paris Health Office and to intending pilgrims. 211. The medical personnel employed by the Saudi Government is composed for the most part of Syrians, not of the highest calibre. It varies somewhat in number and composition, but does not, for the whole country, average more than about fifteen doctors, of whom eight or nine are normally employed in Mecca and Jedda, and perhaps ten or twelve other persons, including one dentist and an analytical chemist. There is no longer a specialist in surgery, but one of the Jedda doctors practises in that line. The others include an oculist, a bacterio logist and an X-ray specialist. An X-ray apparatus, imported from Germany late in the year, was sent to Riyadh to supersede an obsolete outfit there. Another was expected to be imported for use in Mecca. 212. The hospital at Mecca is said to be a good building, well supplied with instruments, and some additions are being made to it. That in Jedda is being very slowly reconditioned. It was stated during the year that Taif was to have a new hospital, and projects were on foot to increase the hospital equipment at Medina, which possessed one hospital in 1932. Ancillary institutions, some used temporarily during the pilgrimage season, need not be enumerated. 213. The number of allopathic doctors in private practice in the country is negligible. There are a few private pharmaceutical chemists m IVlecca and Jedda, and there are in the Hejaz a small number of tolerated practitioners of homeopathy and the IJnam system of medicine as piactised in India. 214 These few facts show how inadequate is the present medical equipment of Saudi Arabia. It is happily supplemented by the dispensaries maintained by the Governments of India and the Dutch East Indies. There is also an Egyptian medical establishment at Mecca, which is supplemented by a medical mission sent annually to the Hejaz by the Egyptian Government. The visits of medical missionaries from Bahrein have been mentioned m paiagiaph 110. 215 The country suffers from a paucity of medical practitioners and from the lack of the specialised services so necessary in a country in which the pilgrimage brings together each year large numbers of miscellaneous people of all nationalities. Some attention is given to vaccination and a little to hygiene in the principal towns of the Hejaz, but sanitary conditions generally are very primitive. XI.— Pilgrimage. 216. Full particulars regarding the 1935 pilgrimage may be found in the usual special pilgrimage report, which was submitted to the Foreign Omce on the 4th August.Lx-'',. 44 217. The estimated total number of pilgrims from overseas again showed a satisfactory increase. The following summary of arrivals at Jedda and Yanbu is drawn up on the same lines as that in paragraph 183 of the report for 1934 :— British and British administered— 1934. 1935. Indian 7,396 11,113 Malayan 173 617 West African 891 879 Sudanese 534 866 Palestinian ... 385 1,432 Dutch East Indian 2,827 3,992 Egyptian 4,302 5,361 Others, including minor British elements 8,744 9,337 25,252 33,597 218. The above figure for 1935 includes 679 Hejazis, who should be deducted to get a true view of the sea-borne foreign pilgrimage. On the other hand, the returns showed 285 West Africans as having reached Qunfida by dhow and sixteen persons who arrived similarly at Lith. Account must also be increasingly taken of foreign pilgrims who come by overland routes, including those who used the new motor route from Nejef to Medina, about 400, and a large contingent of Yemenis, estimated at about 10,000. 219. Pilgrimage Day fell on Thursday, the 14th March, to the disappoint ment of many who hoped for a Friday Haj. Estimates of the total number who “ stood on Arafat ” that day varied from 70,000 to 100,000. 220. A remarkable feature of the 1935 pilgrimage was the number of distinguished persons who took part in it. They included the Nawab of Bahawalpur, who came in state, the principal wife of the Nizam of Hyderabad, ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan, the Glaoui, greatest of the Grand Gaids of Morocco, and other important persons of lesser note, including brothers of the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Dibai 221. Climatic and sanitary conditions were again good, and the dispersal of the pilgrims gave rise to no difficulty. 222. Immediately after the 1935 pilgrimage the Saudi Government gave great publicity to a statement that all charges in respect of dues, fees and transport would be reduced by 25 per cent, in 1936. When the tariff of authorised charges was published in August, the arrangement and grouping of charges was so different from that of the previous year that it was not easy to compare the new tariff with the old. Broadly speaking the 25 per cent, cut had been applied to transport charges, but the aggregate of other charges seemed to be slightly higher than in 1935 and the advantages previously enjoyed by certain pilgrims of the poorer class were abolished. So far as pilgrims able to afford car or camel transport were concerned, the net effect seemed to be a substantial reduction in total necessary expenditure, provided there were no appreciation of gold so great as to counterbalance it in the case of pilgrims coming from countries whose currencies are pegged to sterling. 223. The Saudi Government have adopted a definite policy of discouraging destitute pilgrims from landing on the coast and making their way to Mecca as best they can. They turned back in the late autumn some 500 Indians, who had collected in Hasa and who were repatriated via Bahrein by arrangements with the Government of India. They have also taken measures to restrict the influx of pilgrims by dhow from Massawa and it is probably due at least as much to their representations as to the pressure of His Majesty’s Government and international health authorities that the Italian authorities have at last taken steps to control this traffic to some extent.45 XII.— Slavery. 224. There is very little to record under this head, except what has already been said in paragraph 58 about the proposed arrangement under which His Majesty’s Government may renounce their right of manumission in consideration of the promulgation of Saudi regulations on slavery. The continued exercise of the right of manumission gave rise to no difficulties comparable with those described in paragraph 188 of the report for 1934. There was a diminution in the number of slaves who took refuge at the Legation during the year. This was especially marked during the last seven months. It is difficult to assign a reason for this phenomenon. In so far as it is not purely accidental, it may have been due to the reluctance of slaves to be repatriated to Africa in recent conditions, to greater precautions by owners and the Saudi authorities to prevent slaves from making their way to the Legation and a little perhaps to somewhat improved economic conditions, which must tend to diminish discontent in particular households. The figures for the year are as follows :— On hand at the beginning of January : 1 female. Took refuge during the year : 12 males, 6 females, 1 infant. Manumitted and repatriated : 9 males, 1 female. Locally manumitted : 1 male, 6 females, 1 infant. Left the Legation voluntarily after taking refuge : 2 males. On hand at the end of December : Nil. 225. It was decided during the year not to follow up by any British action, at any rate for the present, a suggestion put forward in 1934 that the Saudi Government might be encouraged to accede to article 2 {a) of the International Slavery Convention 1926. It seemed probable that more would be achieved by continuing to treat the question of slavery in Saudi Arabia as an Anglo-Saudi question on the lines described above. Arrangements were made in June to furnish the Foreign Office with short periodical statements, suitable for transmission to the League of Nations, regarding the operation of the British manumission system in Jedda. XIII.— Naval Matters. 226. As on previous occasions, the little that can be said about what it is too grandiose to describe as Saudi naval organisation has been said earlier in section IV. 227. British sloops visited Jedda as follows during the year : H.M.S. Hastings, the 9th to 13th February; H.M.S. Penzance, the 12th to 17th March, the now traditional visit at pilgrimage time; H.M.S. Penzance, for the morning only on the 29th August, to remove a member of the Legation staff to hospital in Port Sudan; H.M.S. Weston, the 4th to 6th December. The international crisis of the autumn produced certain changes in British naval arrangements in the Red Sea, both as regards the sloops employed and as regards the superior command, but these need not be described in detail. 228. The French warship Bougainville visited Jedda from the 6th to 9th April, with the rear-admiral commanding the Naval Division in the Levant on board, and again from the 4th to 7th December. The Italian destroyer Pantera arrived from Massawa on the 12th May to escort the heir apparent out of the harbour, and was visited by the prince on his way to the Italian steamship Victoria in which he embarked for Italy. The same vessel again visited Jedda from the 29th June to the 1st July, on which occasion there was a muddle over her arrival, as it had not been announced to the Saudi Government. This small incident was liquidated amicably, but some hours passed before the ship could enter the inner harbour and exchange salutes with the shore. It was suggested as a possible explanation of this curious affair that the Pantera was interested in a Swedish ship then in Jedda waters, which was said to be carrying munitions. Anyhow, the Italians blundered and the Saudis took it sensibly.46 229. No questions of principle of common interest to the British Legation and the navy arose during the year. Visits to Jedda continued to be paid by notification only to the Saudi Government, unaccompanied by any request for permission. 230. Mention can most conveniently be made here of the interest taken during the year in the attribution of the island of Tiran, close to the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. It is thought in some quarters that it might be held to be Egyptian, but the balance of evidence seems to favour the view that it must be regarded as Saudi. The debate, at present somewhat academic, was confined to British circles and was not the subject of discussion with either the Saudi or Egyptian Governments. The island may be of potential importance, and one view is that means should be found to secure it effectively for Great Britain, e.g., by purchase or in return for some concession in some other direction. If the island is Saudi, this would be very difficult. XIV.— Miscellaneous. General Position of Foreign Subjects. 231. European British subjects continued to be treated with the same consideration as before. The small number of those resident in the Hejaz, apart from persons employed in the Legation, was increased by the British element in the mixed personnel recruited by the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate. It is worth mentioning that this company has been accorded the privilege of importing moderate quantities of alcoholic beverages for the use of the staff, a privilege which had already been granted to the Jedda staff of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. The authorisation of wireless receiving sets in Jedda has been a boon to British subjects, including members of the Legation staff, as to others. The growth in social life and amenities which was specially noted in paragraph 195 of the report for 1934 has continued. The European community still consists mainly of bachelors and grass-widowers. The departure of all the Soviet Legation ladies deprived it of one feminine element, but they had taken little part in general social life. Their loss was more than counterbalanced by a small increase in the number of occidental ladies. Jedda dances more every year. The success of the golf course has helped to stimulate the idea, still incoherent, that Jedda could do with a general sports club. This is probably over-ambitious. In the meantime, taking one thing with another, the European community has as good a time as can be expected in a place which remains extremely primitive and which has so foul a climate. 232. There was little ground for complaint in 1935 of the treatment accorded to British subjects and protected persons of oriental race. The Saudi Government would still like to eliminate or absorb them, but the drive in this direction was not so apparent in 1935 as in 1934. For one thing, the situation was relieved by the mass repatriation of some 1,500 Africans by the British Legation (see paragraph 194 of the report for 1934), which was completed early in 1935. It is hoped that, what with an increase in the demand for unskilled labour in the Hejaz and the effect of the measures mentioned in paragraph 223, there will be no early recurrence of the situation which necessitated the mass repatriation. Silver Jubilee. 233. The Jubilee of their Majesties The King and Queen was celebrated in Jedda on a scale very modest in itself but unprecedented in poor little Jedda. About 130 persons of many races attended a reception at the Legation on the 6th May, and a dinner on that day was attended by the British and Indian staff and such European British subjects as were still in Jedda. Three of the Legation houses were illuminated. Lady Ryan gave a successful party on the 8th May for children, mostly those of the Legation servants and resident Indians. This sounds a small affair, but it was remarkable in Jedda that some sixty children should be entertained on the sea-shore and be brought back to the Legation for an amateur cinema show.47 European Cemetery. 234. The British Legation was again asked to take charge of the cemetery at a meeting of the committee held on the 1st March. The effort to maintain the cemetery in decent condition and to keep it on a sound financial basis was sustained, but certain improvements, which were discussed at the meeting in March, had to be left over until 1936, owing to unavoidable delay in obtaining advice and estimates. Bibliography and Cartography. 235. Books on Arabia may easily escape the notice of the Legation, but mention may be made of three which attracted attention in 1935, viz., the first edition published for general circulation of T. E. Lawrence’s Seven Pillars of Wisdom, C. Raswan’s Black Tents of Arabia, and D. Carruthers’s Arabian Adventure. The first is too well-known to need comment. The second is picturesque, but of little value apart from the excellent photographic illustrations. The third is a pleasantly written record of travel in 1909 to 1910 by a writer whose main object was the pursuit of the oryx, but it contains much of more general interest. 236. Any person with leisure and access to libraries who would produce a bibliography of publications in European languages on the history of Arabia and records of Arabian travel would be filling a long-felt want. The available material is at present scattered. 237. No important additions to the cartography of Arabia came to the notice of the Legation in 1935 except one portion of a 1/2,000,000 14 Southern Arabia Series,” which is being produced by the Survey of India. The subject of maps of Arabia attracted much attention during the year in connexion with the various frontier questions which have arisen during the past two years. The Legation compiled a systematic catalogue of all modern maps in its possession. This may not include all important maps which have been published, but it gives a very fair idea of the progress so far made in the mapping of the peninsula south of Iraq and Transjordan. Copies were sent to the Foreign Office. 238. Mr. Philby may be expected to publish a route-map of a very interesting journey by car which he and Mrs. Philby made towards the end of the year from Damascus to Jedda via Jauf, Hail and Riyadh. This was the last stage of a remarkable motor tour from Jedda to London and back via Koweit, Iraq, Syria, Asia Minor, Central Europe, France, Spain, Tangier, French and Italian North Africa and Egypt.8017 [11812] /fr /’V V THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

I.—Introduction. THE war between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen early in the year, and the peace settlement in which it ended, dwarfed all other happenings in Saudi Arabia in 1934. It would be interesting to speculate in detail on their effect on the evolution of Ibn Saud and his regime, but the subject is still too conjectural to merit lengthy treatment. 2. Broadly speaking, it may be said, now that more than six months have elapsed, that Ibn Saud’s position in his own dominions has been very little affected. It was suggested in the autumn in Koweit, that he had lost prestige among his tribes, who attributed the moderation of his peace terms to inability to extract more. His permanent prestige must, however, depend on factors more directly affecting the sections of his subjects concerned. The elements of disaffection always exist. The King rules not by the love which he may inspire in some but by the fear he inspires in all. There have been no serious signs of his losing his grip on his tribes as a whole, even though he may have had to acquiesce in the unwillingness of some of them to go to the Yemen front. His hold in the towns and settled areas seems to be at least as strong. 3. If there be any gradually growing weakness, it is at the centre. Ibn Saud has of late shown signs of a certain lethargy. It may be true, as one critic says, that the passion for sport, to which he now gives such free play, exhausts his energies. He probably continues to believe, too ardently for a man of his age, in the excellence of ‘‘woman in our hours of ease.” Anyhow, the King does not perhaps impose himself on his advisers as effectively as of old or drive them as an united team. Rumours of dissension in his own family are doubtless exaggerated, but they are not without some foundation. 4. Material prosperity is still to seek. The 1934 pilgrimage was only a little better than that of 1933. No economic schemes productive of immediate money materialised in 1934, except in so far as the Standard Oil Company of California, persevering with a good hope in Hasa, paid a substantial further sum under their agreement. On the other hand, the finances of Ibn Saud and his Government survived the strain of war, and money was found somehow or other, if not to keep the salaries of officials up to date, to meet essential current requirements. 5. The King’s appearance of victory in the war and the moderation of the settlement enhanced his prestige in the outer Arab world, many elements of which would be glad to hail him as the great Unifier. The attempts made in 1934 by Nationalists from Syria, Palestine and elsewhere to give a new impetus to pan-Arabism may derive some inspiration from the spectacle of Ibn Saud fillino- the role of the one really great man among the Arabs now that King Feisal of Iraq has gone, a spectacle seen close up by the mission of leaders mentioned in paragraph 32 of this report. Whether Ibn Saud is himself ready to lend himself to pan-Arab schemes and to take the incidental risks, including the risk of embroilment with European Powers, is another question.[11812] n 2 6. As regards his position in the larger world of Islam, Ibn Sand appears to mark time. He cannot dominate it and he is still dependent on it for the pilgrims, who are essential to the prosperity of Saudi Arabia. There is almost certainly no foundation for the suggestion made in certain circles in 1934 that he might make a bid for the Caliphate. To do so would be difficult to reconcile '^ith his Wahhabi principles. On the other hand, he gave few signs during the year of the old Wahhabi fire. It is significant that during the whole course of his quarrel with the Imam Yahya, no special appeal was made to religious antagonism. The Imam was not reproached with heresy, even when he was accused of monstrous aggression and bad faith. The word “hypocrite,” with all its early Islamic historical associations, was not flung about as it had been at the time of the Ibn Rifada rebellion in 1932. When kissing-time came again, Moslem brotherhood was the only wear. 7. All through the year, the eyes of Saudi Arabia were glued to Arabian affairs. It will be seen later how little development there was in the relations of the Saudi Government with any Powers outside Arabia except Great Britain and Italy. Attention may, however, be drawn to two matters of general interest in this connexion. One was the more tolerant attitude of Ibn Saud towards visits by foreign representatives to Taif. The other was the fact that Fuad Bey Hamza, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, went on leave in July, and devoted part of a long absence to visits to European centres, in which he increased his contact with high personages. He was more than once in Paris, spent a couple of days in Geneva, went to Rome in September, and arrived in London later that month. On his way to his home in Syria he spent a couple of days in Istanbul. Going and coming he was in Cairo. These movements are the more interesting because of Fuad Bey’s character and peculiar position. He is ambitious. His natural leanings are to some form of pan-Arabism. He is probably not completely trusted by Ibn Saud, but he is too useful to be dispensed with. On his own side, he has enough independence of mind and boldness to follow out side lines of his own, even though he may have to come to heel at his master’s call. II. —Foreign RelationSv (A )—With States in Arabia. (1) Iraq. 8. Little news reached Jedda in 1934 regarding the tribal situation on the Saudi-Iraq frontier. It presumably continued to be reasonably healthy. Attention was drawn in Bagdad in April to the presence in Iraqi territory of numerous sections of Nejdi tribes including the Mutair, the Awazim and the Beni Khalid, a phenomenon which could be adequately explained by lack of grazing in Nejd but to which a political significance was also attributed in various quarters. It was suggested that certain chiefs had thrown themselves on the protection of important tribal personages in Iraq for fear of the troubles that might ensue, if Ibn Saud were worsted by the Imam Yahya. Subsequent reports were almost silent regarding the frontier area until October, when it was learnt that a Saudi representative was to attend a conference at Palmyra to deal with inter-tribal affairs. The main purpose of this conference was to deal with matters concerning the Governments of Iraq and Syria. One of these, however, related to camels carried off by the Ruwalla tribe into Nejd in the spring of 1933 and to a retaliatory seizure of Ruwalla camels in Iraq. The affair had been discussed at the meeting of Saudi and Iraqi representatives at Jauf in June 1934 (paragraph 8 of the report for that year), and partly settled. The French authorities claimed, however, that they were also concerned as the Ruwalla were a Syrian tribe. This accounts for the inclusion of the case in the agenda of the Palmyra Conference and the presence of a Saudi representative thereat. No conclusion was reached regarding the Ruwalla affair. It was apparently again discussed at a later meeting attended by Saudi and Iraqi delegates only. Very little is known about this later meeting, but views would appear to have been exchanged about various matters of tribal interest, including certain raids on the Saudi-Iraqi frontier in the spring of 1934.9. Except for one breeze, to be described presently, the political relations between the two countries continued to be correct, all the more correct perhaps because King Ghazi seems to have been lukewarm in his attitude towards pan- Arab schemes and has so far shown no signs of succeeding to his late father’s position as an aspirant to ascendency in the Arab world. He made a sort of offer of mediation in the Saudi-Yemen quarrel in March and received an amiablj evasive reply from Ibn Saud. Suitable telegrams were exchanged on other occasions, including the happy termination of the war. No Iraqi representative took part in the mission of Arab leaders, mentioned in paragraph 32. 10. The breeze mentioned in the preceding paragraph blew up in August, when the Iraqi Government addressed a formal remonstrance to the Saudi Government regarding the proceedings of Ibrahim-bin-Muammar, the Saudi Charge d’Affaires in Bagdad. The details of the complaint were somewhat differently stated by different personages, but Ibn Muammar was accused of having made improper speeches at Kerbela and Nejef, of having engaged in propaganda in favour of Ibn Saud’s candidature for the kingship of all Arabia and of having inspired hostile articles, including inter alia comments derogatory to the Amir Abdullah, in the Iraqi press. By this time the Iraqi Government already had a fully accredited representative in Jedda in the person of Saiyid Kamil-al-Gilani, the brother of a statesman who had been successively the King’s Private Secretary and Prime Minister in Iraq. This young man arrived in Jedda in June preceded by no great reputation for intelligence or capacity. He was probably justified by his instructions in taking a strong line and demanding Ibn Muammar’s recall, but he carried them out so offensively as to give grave umbrage to the Saudi Government. The latter sought the advice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and made counter-accusations against the Iraqi Government. One of their allegations was that papers found during the occupation of Hodeida proved the complicity of authorities both in Iraq and in Transjordan in anti-Saudi intrigues during the war with the Yemen. 11. His Majesty’s Government were guarded, and in due course the parties directly concerned found means to patch up the quarrel, with the result that both representatives remained at their posts. This was probably due a good deal to Nuri Pasha As Said, who became Minister for Foreign Affairs in Iraq three weeks after the demand for Ibn Muammar’s recall had been made. The precise manner in which the affair was liquidated is not known but it was realised on the Iraqi side that their representative in Jedda had been too brusque. It was doubtless easier for Nuri Pasha to admit this than it might have been for his predecessor, and Nuri Pasha is persona grata in high Saudi circles. Fuad Bey Hamza, who met him in London in September, spoke of him afterwards in private conversation as the man destined to replace King Feisal in the direction of the destinies of Iraq, and one whom he, Fuad, had suspected of not being a sound Arab but who had reassured him on that point. He foreshadowed the possibility of a visit by Nuri Pasha to Ibn Saud, if the elections in Iraq went well for Nuri. 12. There is an obvious connexion between the matters just mentioned and the idea of a general rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, a subject to which further reference will be made in paragraph 61. Nothing definite had happened in this respect up to the end of the year but about that time there was a marked improvement in Saudi-Iraqi relations. Negotiations for a formal agreement to settle various outstanding questions appeared to be in contemplation. 13. The project of a motor route from Iraq to the Hejaz appeared to languish early in the year, although, as stated in paragraph 10 of the report for 1933, the Iraqi Government were understood to be pursuing it. As a question between the two Governments it again became active in the autumn. Some sort of a preliminary understanding was reached, sufficient to pave the way for a joint survey of the proposed motor route from Nejef to Medina. The two survey parties met on the frontier in the latter part of November and prospected the route from there to Medina. Their report was favourable and they proceeded overland to Bagdad in December, after the Iraqi party had visited Mecca and Jedda. It was understood at the end of the year that the way had been prepared for a definite agreement between the Governments which would enable the route to be brought into use for the 1935 Pilgrimage.5 (2) Transjordan. 14. It is delightful to be able to dismiss more briefly than heretofore the relations between Transjordan and Ibn Sand in 1934. The treaty concluded in 1933 has justified itself, not so much because its specific terms have been strictly 'dhered to, as because both have been on their best behaviour since it was concluded. The proposals for a personal meeting between Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah (see paragraph 27 of the report for 1933) broke down for reasons which need not be related in detail and it was agreed to postpone the project indefinitely. At one moment during the Saudi-Yemen crisis, the Saudi Govern ment manifested alarm over the alleged intention of the Amir to send an emissary to ginger up the Imam and to concert with him plans for the destruction of Ibn Saud. The emissary did not proceed and the war had been over for several months when a Beirut newspaper published what purported to be an anti-Saudi treaty concluded or proposed between the Amir and the Imam in February 1934. In the meanwhile the Amir had, in May 1934, gone out of his way to send a message to the King through the British authorities assuring him of his good intentions and his fidelity to his treaty obligations. At least one direct exchange of friendly messages took place. There had been such an exchange in the autumn of 1933 regarding a person in whom the Amir is interested and for whom he sought permission to reside in the Hejaz, a request to which Ibn Saud acceded. It was reported in May 1934 that the Amir had received a friendly reply to a personal communication to the King regarding the property in the Hejaz of two of the Amir’s retainers. 15. No raiding was reported from the frontier and such minor incidents as occurred are not worth recording in detail. The machinery contemplated in the Saudi-Transjordan Treaty was not brought into operation in the precise manner laid down, e.g., as regards regular meetings of frontier officers, the first of which was to be held at Qariyat-al-Milh. The officer commanding the Transjordan Desert Patrol entertained the Governor of Tebuk, however,' at a place called Meshaitiya in June, when the Governor was rather formal and suspicious but unbent in personal conversation with Major Glubb. The authorities on both sides were also in correspondence by letter and wireless, with not wholly unsatisfactory results. Early in the year Transjordan had occasion to complain of Saudi attempts to seduce tribes but the matter did not assume proportions so grave as to necessitate diplomatic action. Diplomatic correspon dence did continue to pass on subjects which, had the treaty machinery been perfected, might more naturally have been dealt with locally in the first instance, but it was small in volume and lacked the old recriminatory vim. There was a tendency to use the sinister word “Wisaqa,” or retaliatory seizure, in a more extended sense than that allowed by the treaty, but even'the cases of alleged “ Wisaqa ” were neither numerous nor important. 16. The most awkward incidents of the year, apart from that at Hazim. which will be mentioned presently, were certain violations of Transjordan territory in the autumn, notably on or about the 5th September when the Saudi Governor of Qaf and another official were alleged to have penetrated some 12 kilom. into Transjordan. Those cases were the subject of oral representations to the Saudi Government in November. No reply had been received up to the end of the year. It may be mentioned by way of contrast that, when a Transjordan armed car patrol unwittingly crossed the frontier near Haditha on the 2nd July, a spontaneous apology was sent to the Saudi Government through the Legation and elicited a somewhat ungracious reply in which inter alia the patrol was accused of having asked improper questions at the Saudi post at Haditha. 17. The question of the Saudi post near Hazim (see paragraph 34 of the report for 1933) went on indeterminately throughout the year. The Saudis did not maintain their post continuously and, when it was manned, they camped on their own side of the frontier. They continued, however, to water at the wells, without seeking the formal permission, which the Transjordan authorities had in 1933 expressed readiness to grant on certain terms. On the 2nd June, 1934, Fuad Bey Hamza countered the personal letter containing this offer by a long delayed repfv in which he asked to be informed of the results of any recent survey, which might have been made at Hazim. This eventually caused the particular question of [11812] B 30 Hazim to merge in the more general question of the lie of the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, which for the purpose of the present report can be more conveniently dealt with later, in the section dealing with Anglo-Saudi relations. 18. The High Commissioner for Transjordan expressed the view in Marcli^ 1934 that it would be better not to reopen with the Saudi Government the questioflP^ of customs relations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia, as commerce was, in fact, proceeding satisfactorily between the two countries. It was thought that formal negotiations might merely bring into prominence divergences of view, which it might be difficult to reconcile. The Saudi Government made no move on their side except for a complaint in October that merchants travelling between Syria and Saudi Arabia were encountering difficulty in traversing Transjordan. They had not replied up to the end of the year to a request for specific information. In these circumstances the general question of customs relations and commercial intercourse remained in abeyance throughout the year. (3) Yemen. 19. At the end of 1933 there were some signs of a detente in the acute situation which had grown up during that year between Ibn Saud and the Imam of the Yemen, who will still be called the Imam in this report for purposes of distinction, although the title King of the Yemen came into increasing use in 1934. Ibn Saud was still, however, most insistent on his claim to Najran and, as stated in paragraph 46 of the last report, he was more aggrieved than he had allowed to appear publicly by the proceedings of the Yemenis in the mountain area north-west of Saada. It became evident early in 1934 that those proceedings had not been limited to intrigue, but that the Imam’s people had actually invaded districts claimed by Ibn Saud and set up an administration there, helped apparently by Abdul Wahhab, the liveliest of the Idrisis. 20. The situation again deteriorated early in January. Ibn Saud sent his heir apparent, the Amir Saud, to Abha. He countermanded arrangements to send his second son Feisal south at the same time and he went on with the arrange ments for a conference at Abha to draw up a treaty and discuss the question of Najran, which the King was willing to reserve for such discussion. He conceived himself to have already reached a preliminary agreement on other points which needed only embodiment in treaty form. 21. The heir apparent reached Abha about the 24th January. Fuad Bey Hamza, who was to conduct the political negotiations, left for the same destination on the 28th January, and, although the Yemeni delegation headed by Abdullah A1 Wazir was delayed, the conference actually took place. It was probably foredoomed to failure from the start, despite the facile optimism with which the news was hailed outside Arabia, as when the Times of the 9th February acclaimed the way in which prudent diplomacy had averted war and headed its leader “Arabia Still Fortunate.” Nevertheless there were good reasons for playing out the comedy of a conference. The Imam had played for time all along. Ibn Saud had every interest in showing himself a reasonable man, glad to exhaust the resources of diplomacy, until he could be sure of his overseas pilgrims, the last of whom would not arrive until shortly before Pilgrimage Day, the 25th March. 22. Silence brooded over the distant conference for over a month. It was broken on the 17th March, when the Amir Feisal sent a message of foreboding to Sir Andrew Ryan. This was followed by a more formal message on the 22nd March, to the effect that neither the meeting of delegates nor further direct correspondence between the rulers had achieved anything, and that the King had ordered his forces to advance in order to recover the mountain area usurped by the Imam. He had still left the door open for peace, but his heir might have to cross the frontier, if no satisfaction were obtained from the Imam before he reached it. 23. The fat was even more completely in the fire than this message suggested. The Saudi forces began to advance on the 20th March, but it was not a question of marching into an area claimed as Saudi and going across it to a frontier. Strategy required a turning movement through unquestionably7 [11812] b 4 Yemen territory, if that inaccessible area were to be occupied. In April there was a complete state of war on at least three distinct fronts—Najran, the mountain area, and the frontier region near the Red Sea, to which the King’s son Feisal was despatched on the 15th April. Little light has ever been thrown on the course of the operations in the interior. The Saudis claimed, probably C^th truth, to have driven the Yemenis out of Najran on the 21st April. The operations in the mountains further east were apparently successful enough to bring the Amir Saud within striking distance of Saada. If so, he never struck, whether because he could not or because Ibn Saud’s policy forbade. The news from the fronts in the interior soon became negligible and the rumours unworthy of attention. 24. It was far different towards the coast, where Feisal did nothing but reap laurels, the easier to gather as the coastal tribes, always more or less disaffected to the Imam, looked gladly towards the rising Saudi sun. The Yemenis offered some resistance at the two most important fortified places inside the frontier, but Haradh had already fallen about the 15th April and Medi was occupied by Feisal on the 26th April. The rest of the campaign was a promenade. It was foreseen that the Yemenis would not defend Luhayya, but it was thought that they would attempt resistance at Hodeida, instead of which they evacuated it so alertly that it was left, for purposes of government, to its own devices and the support, more moral than material, of foreign warships for several days. The Yemenis stole softly away on the 29th-30th April. On the evening of the 30th some local tribesmen and riff-raff indulged in disorder and pillage. The arrival of H.M.S. Penzance on the 1st May, followed by the landing of a small party next day, a flight of aeroplanes from Aden, and various other measures helped to steady the situation. Italian vessels arrived on the 3rd and 4th May, and were perhaps not so composing an element. The first Saudi forces entered Hodeida on the 5th May. The Amir Feisal arrived on the 6th, and rapidly proceeded to organise the military and civil administration. The Saudi Minister of Finance, who had been sent post haste to deal with the civil side, arrived on the 11th May, with a considerable equipment of officials, wireless, &amp;c. 25. The military situation was now stable. The Amir Saud was, as described above, stationary on fairly advanced positions in the interior. The Amir Feisal held the coastal areas for some distance inland from the sea, and had no difficulty in extending his occupation some distance south of Hodeida. The Yemeni forces had fought so little that they were practically intact, spread along a line roughly having Zebid, Menakha and Hajja for its principal positions. 26. The rulers had not ceased to correspond as Moslem brothers should even in times of trouble. Ibn Saud concentrated on securing acceptance of three points. These were: (1) Recognition of his right in Najran; (2) the effective evacuation of the mountain area, as well as the release of all hostages taken there, and cessation of interference therein; and (3), for the King would now accept nothing less in this respect, the surrender of the Idrisis. The Imam concentrated on efforts to bring about fresh negotiation, to be conducted direct with the King by the same Abdullah-bin-Wazir, who had represented him at Abha. Ibn Saud made it clear that nothing would move him from his demands, but he agreed to receive Ibn Wazir, who reached Mecca on the 30th April. While he was on the way the Saudi Government took the long-delayed step of publishing a Green Book in defence of their attitude. It was carefully compiled, and it contained much of interest. It appeared too late, however, to be more than a damp squib, let off when everyone was more concerned with the rushing course of events than with their antecedents. 27. Ibn Saud was just moving to Taif and Ibn Wazir followed him thither. He was a very different man from the Ibn Wazir who, before going to Abha, had a reputation for extreme intractability and did nothing at Abha to impair it. At Taif he showed himself stout-hearted but politic. He established personal relations with Ibn Saud, so friendly that they were accused afterwards of having come to a private understanding, under which Ibn Saud would promote Ibn Wazir’s interest in the Yemen, where he and his family are in some sense potential rivals of the ruling house.8 i' 111 'i. — 28. It may have been due to Ibn Wazir’s confirmation of the Imam’s reiterated assurances that he meant to comply with the King’s demands that Ibn Saud announced on the 12th May a suspension of hostilities on all fronts. Anyhow, they worked together so well and so speedily that on the 20th May a treaty of “ Islamic Friendship and Brotherhood ” was signed at Taif, complete with a protocol on arbitration and annexed letters. The treaty provided fjfc^ the immediate termination of the state of war in anticipation of ratification, but the Saudi Government made it clear in the annexed letters that it could not be brought into force as a whole by an exchange of ratifications until the Imam had completely fulfilled the King’s three conditions. 29. Even now Ibn Saud was not sure of the Imam. Within a month of the signature of the treaty he was again so suspicious that he announced that, if the conditions were not complied with by the 29th May, he would restart hostilities. Reports from the Yemen itself were also discouraging. The moral of the Saudi troops in and about Hodeida seemed to have deteriorated somewhat. There were signs of some revulsion of feeling among the tribes, which had welcomed them. Accounts of the Yemeni military dispositions suggested that they might be preparing a belated counter-attack. Presently, however, the situation grew easier. On the 29th May Ibn Saud announced that he would hold his hand for a few days longer. On the 3rd June, Hasan-al-Idrisi, the head of the family and one of his two most important nephews, reached Hodeida; three hundred of their followers were surrendered elsewhere. On the 11th June it was announced officially that the evacuation of the mountain area had been completed. Next day Abdullah-al-Wazir left for Hodeida in the same ship as a courier bearing the Saudi instrument of ratification. The Imam approved the treaty t?! j t J u . ne &gt; an d the ratifications were exchanged at Hodeida on the wuuiu ^ 18 nofc clear whether the remaining Idrisi of importance, Abdul- Wahhab, had actually been surrendered before that date, but in due course he .lowed his uncle and brother to Taif, where they were kindly treated and given permission to reside at Mecca, instead of being deported to Riyadh as some had anticipated. J 30 The liquidation of the military situation followed quickly. The evacuation of the Yemen littoral by sea and by land was completed by'the 6th July. I he position m the interior remained somewhat obscure The Saudi Heir Apparent had presumably withdrawn from Yemeni territory, but some j 1 ? d fn t f ° ; what ™ going on over the border, and it was announced on the 13th July that he would remain m Najran until arrangements had been made for the simultaneous withdrawal of the Imam’s eldest son from his thaTX C 10 &lt;? T Sldt :, P n fh 27th Jul y- howeve '-’ it was announced that the Amir Saud had returned to Abha, and he reached Taif on the 10th August. The Amir Feisal had tarried in Asir to deal with administrative questions, but he arrived m Jedda on the 5th August, and was in time to go out to meet his elder brother on the road to Taif from the south. S 31. The Treaty of Taif, a long document in 23 articles, was concluded for twenty lunar years. Considered as a peace settlement it was, on the face of it eminent y satisfactory. From the Imam’s point of view it contained nothing to justify the suggestion, made notably by Mr. Philby, that it established a veiled Saudi protsctorate over the Yemen It gave Ibn Saud a secure title, so far as a treaty m Aiabia can establish a title, to Najran and the disputed frontier re°lon Its longest article, that defining the frontier, was difficult to follow owing to the lack of information regarding many of the remote places and tribes named in it but it was probably as workmanlike as anything that could have been reduced to writing by negotiators who suffered greatly, if not as greatly as European^ from the same lack of information. Effect has not yet been given to a clause providing for a joint delimitation of the frontier. s e P rovl a m g 32. In the outside Arab world, the treaty was hailed as something more than a peace settlement. It was acclaimed in many quarters as the greatest strirPi ever made towards Arab unity Those who wished to see in ft a treatTof alltnce between the only two really independent rulers in Arabia could do so not indeed in its provisions which produced no such effect, but in the affirmations of Islamic fw taf^ brotherh 9° d whlc h abounded in it and the assertion of the principle that the two countries formed one nation. Provision of a non-compulsory nature/6/ [11812] b 5 m 9 was made for possible joint action in the foreign diplomatic field. The settle ment was certainly not based, however, on sentimentality on the part of the principals. Ibn Sand had rebuffed all suggestions of mediation by brother Arabs, though he received them all politely and entertained hospitably a mission of _Arab leaders which arrived in Jedda on the 16th April. Its members were Haj -C Vmin Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Amir Shakib Arslan, the veteran Arab Nationalist, Hashim Bey-al-Atasi of Damascus and Muhammad Pasha-al- Allouba, a former Minister of State in Egypt. These gentlemen hung about the King’s court until the 12th June, when they accompanied Ibn Wazir to Hodeida, all save the Egyptian, and went on to see the Imam. There is no reason to suppose that the mission influenced the settlement in any material way, though they may have influenced the form of the treaty. Nevertheless, the doves returned to their respective arks, with their beaks full of greenstuff gathered much more from the spreading Saudi tree than from the meagre mountain bushes of San’a. They acquired merit, even if they had not earned it, in Arab eyes ; and it all redounded to the glory of Ibn Saud. 33. Ibn Saud’s real reasons for his moderation cannot be gauged with precision. He went against many of his entourage, who at first thought that he would attempt to secure San’a and conquer the whole Yemen and who, when this ceased to be likely, expected him at least to increase his demands to the extent of asking for a rectification of the frontier and a war indemnity. In attempting to explain the King’s own attitude account must be taken of many factors, though it may be impossible to assess their relative weight. The war had already imposed a great strain on his financial resources. Many of his tribesmen had shown little appetite for fighting on a distant front. Some had even refused to march and he may have had reason to fear trouble north and east, if things should go badly in the south. The military situation was, as has been explained above, quite indeterminate, possibly unhealthy, in the interior; at any rate far less favourable than it appeared to those who only saw a Saudi prince in Hodeida. The King has shown increasing anxiety to consolidate his regime. He may have realised the historical fact that Imams of the Yemen have a way of coming out top on their mountain-tops, even when all seems lost to them in outlying regions. He certainly realised and perhaps exaggerated the danger of Italian intervention, if he should seriously upset the balance in South-Western Arabia. The cautiousness and constant counsels of moderation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom encouraged no hope of their restoring the balance, if this danger should materialise. Finally, though, as has been said above, he did not make peace to please the Arab world, the advantage of playing to that gallery may have counted for something in a balance of considerations. 34. The remainder of the year passed quietly, despite rumours of fresh trouble, stimulated now and then by reports of restlessness on the part of the Imam’s sons, especially his heir, Seif-ul-Islam Ahmed. Nothing prevented the King from having a merry time with his entourage at Taif in August before he went back to Riyadh and set about distributing largesse to the tribesmen who had served in the war. The outlay was so lavish as to confirm at least one observer, Mr. Philby, in his belief (wish fathering the dear thought) that the King had extracted a secret indemnity from the Imam. There is no other evidence of this. The fox of San’a came out of the conflict as happily as the lion of Nejd. As for the rumours that one or other or both were spoiling for another fight, the TJmm-al-Qura echoed on the 23rd November denials in the Iman of San’a and enthused over the way in which the crescent of peace had waxed to a full moon irradiating Arabia. A renewal of warfare seems unlikely so long as the old fox and the old lion survive. Their ardent sons may live to fight another day. (4) States in the South and South-East of Arabia. 35. Nothing came to light during the year regarding any attempt on the part of Ibn Saud to extend his influence into the Aden Protectorate, including the Hadhramaut, nor were there any signs of his concerning himself with the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. No political importance appeared to attach to the visit paid to the Hejaz by the ex-Sultan Taimur-bin-Faisal, who, as stated in the last report, arrived in the Hejaz on the 7th December, 1933. He prolonged his stay over the pilgrimage and was treated with distinction.36. No personage of importance seems to have come on pilgrimage from the Trucial Sheikhdoms or Qatar in 1934, but a brother of the Sheikh of Dibai started for the Hejaz in November. There was no evidence of more in the way of direct intercourse between the rulers of the various principalities and Saudi Arabia than has normally been maintained, notably with Ibn Jiluwi, the King’s cousin and Governor of Hasa. Presents in money and kind are said to pass, buj^* the evidence of this, so far as it is known in Jedda, lacks all precision, except as regards the alleged subsidy paid by the Sheikh of Qatar to Ibn Saud, which has been mentioned in previous reports. Whatever may have passed between the Sheikh of Qatar and the King, when the former visited Riyadh in 1933, there was no outward sign in 1934 of any important development of their direct relations. The sheikh admitted the existence of such relations in the spring and had to be warned to limit himself to pure courtesy. 37. It is perhaps just worth while to mention one incident which was reported from Bahrein in March. A Persian in Qatar, having a claim against two men from the Manasir tribe, sought the help of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi without success. He then appealed to the Sheikh of Qatar, who gave him a letter to Ibn Jiluwi, who promised to recover the debt. 38. It may be inferred from the above that the actual situation between the rulers mentioned and Ibn Saud underwent no perceptible change. On the other hand, the question of their frontiers and his became one of capital importance. This will be dealt with later under the head of Anglo-Saudi relations (paragraphs 55 to 58 and 63). (5) Bahrein. 39. The question of transit dues (see paragraphs 58 to 60 of the report for 1933) and the issues connected with it continued throughout 1934 to be the only matters directly affecting the relations between Saudi Arabia and Bahrein. They were the subject of much correspondence among the British authorities concerned and of some discussion with the Saudi Government. The latter remained consistently shy of the proposal constantly renewed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom that all the issues should be explored by a local conference of Saudi and Bahreini representatives at Bahrein, assisted by the British Political Agent. No definite progress was made on those lines, and on the other hand Ibn Saud did nothing further to develop a port at Ras Tanura. Trade seems to have proceeded on much the usual lines, though there were signs of new commercial factors, which might affect it eventually, among them the activity of Japanese shipping in the Persian Gulf and the first visit of an Italian merchant vessel to Bahrein in June. By October the British India Steam Navi gation Company were so much impressed by the dangers of foreign competition that they enquired as to the possibility of the British authorities surveying and marking the approaches to Ras Tanura and moving the Bahrein Government to desist from opposition to direct shipments to the mainland. 40. In these circumstances it will suffice to indicate very briefly the principal phases through which the matter passed after the inconclusive efforts made early in the year to promote a solution. They were as follows :— {a) When Sir Andrew Ryan visited Taif in July Ibn Saud went out of his way to raise the question personally in language of extreme bitterness. He scouted any idea of the Bahrein Government playing an indepen dent role. He accused His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom of preventing direct shipments to his coast and boycotting his efforts to develop it. (5) The matter was discussed in general terms with Fuad Bey Hamza during his visit to London in September. He promised to re-submit the British proposal to the King, but nothing further was heard from the Saudi Government up to the end of the year, although it had been urged on Fuad Bey that, if the local conference were held quickly, and if it should fail, there would still be time to bring the matter into any general Anglo-Saudi discussions after Sir Andrew Ryan’s return to Jedda.11 [11812] b 6 (c) The whole subject was reviewed at an interdepartmental meeting in London on the 8th October, at which the Political Resident and Sir Andrew Ryan were present. A general line of action was suggested, the principle of which was that the British proposal should still be pursued and that certain assurances might be given to the Saudi Government, if they seemed likely to overcome opposition to the holding of the conference or to surmount difficulties during its proceedings. A guarded formula was adopted regarding one particular point to which the Saudi Government attach great importance, namely, their desire to obtain immunity from dues in favour of goods consigned to the King or themselves. (d) It was just after this that the British India Steam Navigation Company made the enquiries mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The Political Resident was inclined to think that the time had come to make a virtue of necessity and fall in generally with the view r s of the company. The Government of India suggested, semi-officially, in December, that an alternative might be to give Ibn Saud an induce ment to abandon his idea of developing his own ports by abolishing transit dues. They thought that the Bahrein Government might be recompensed for this sacrifice by the preservation of the position of Bahrein as an entrepot and might consent themselves to make the offer in the course of the proposed local conference. 41. Mention may be made of a tendentious rumour which appeared in Syrian and Egyptian papers in the summer to the effect that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had concluded a new treaty with the “ Amirate ” of Bahrein. The rumour is absurd, but is worth recording as it was suggested that His Majesty’s Government had undertaken not to stand in the way of Bahrein joining in “a national alliance of Arab Amirates in the Persian Gulf.” 42. The question of Saudi Arabia’s external telegraphic communications, in which Bahrein would be concerned, is dealt with elsewhere (see paragraph 69). In the same order of ideas it may be mentioned that in October the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in India agreed in principle to a Saudi proposal for the establishment of a daily postal service between the Saudi post offices at Hofuf and Qatif and the post office at Bahrein, to take the place of the existing weekly service. (6) Koweit and the Kowmt Neutral Zone. 43. Hamud-al-Bagawi, agreeably known in local circles as the ‘ ‘ butcher of Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, remained throughout the year in charge of the Saudi embargo on trade between Koweit and 'Nejd. In principle this embargo, which, though the Saudi Government dislike the name, is known as the “Koweit Blockade,” was maintained with the same vigour as in earlier years. In practice it would appear to have broken down a good deal owing to tribal opposition and the facilities for evasion resulting from a considerable movement of the Awazim and other tribes into Koweit territory early in the year. It is possible that at the time Ibn Saud himself, preoccupied with his struggle with the Yemen, may not have wished to try his eastern tribesmen too high. The weakening of the Saudi restrictions apparently continued during the autumn, when Awazim tribesmen, coming mostly from the Koweit Neutral Zone, but probably in touch with their fellow-tribesmen further south, frequented Koweit in large numbers. The sheikh told the Political Agent in October that several cargoes of food-stuffs had been bought in Koweit in September and October by merchants from Jubail and Jinnah and had been successfully landed on the Hasa coast. Colonel Dickson records two instances of Nejdi merchants having visited Koweit to buy goods with the King’s authority and apparently for his own use. His agents bought up Maria Theresa dollars there on a scale sufficient to send up the price in October from 83 rupees per hundred to 103 rupees, the object presumably being to finance disbursements to tribesmen in Riyadh (see paragraphs 34 and 127). 44. As against these indications of weakening of the blockade, mention must be made of an unconfirmed report which reached Bahrein on the 30th July that three Mutairis, caught smuggling provisions bought in Koweit, were taken to Hasa and put to death by Ibn Jiluwi.12 45. The position of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in regard to Koweit was reviewed in February in letters exchanged between the India Office and the Foreign Office. This important correspondence dealt with only one matter directly concerning the sheikh’s relations with Ibn Sand, namely, the question how to obviate the disadvantages incidental to direct correspondence between them on official subjects. After consideration of alternatives, it decided to sound the sheikh on a proposal that all correspondence should pas^r through British channels, i.e., the Political Agent and the Legation in Jedda. The sheikh’s reception of the suggestion was so unfavourable that it was eventually decided not to pursue it, at any rate until the question of the Koweit oil concession had been disposed of. 46. Another question dealt with in the correspondence mentioned above bears indirectly on the relations between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, namely, that of the nature and extent of the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the protection of Koweit. 47. Concurrently with the examination of these and the other matters dealt with in the correspondence, His Majesty’s Government returned to the question of measures to bring the Koweit blockade to an end. This question passed through various phases, which included conversations with Ibn Saud himself, when Sir Andrew Ryan visited Taif, and with Fuad Bey in London in September. It was foreshadowed in the latter conversation that the matter might figure prominently in eventual Anglo-Saudi negotiations after Sir Andrew Ryan’s return to Jedda. It seemed necessary, however, in view of the circumstances described in last year’s report, to get a clear situation in the first instance with the Sheikh of Koweit. On the 31st October the Political Resident was instructed, unless he saw objection, to take a favourable opportunity of informing the sheikh that, while it would be necessary to begin by renewing the proposal that the questions at issue should be examined jointly by Saudi and Koweiti commissioners, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared, if that solution failed, to seek a settlement on the basis favoured by the sheikh himself, namely, that customs posts should be established inside Saudi territory. They could not, of course, guarantee success, but they would use their best endeavours, subject to an essential preliminary, namely, that the sheikh should abandon his old claims against Ibn Saud, with the exception of one item. They considered that his position in regard to the claims generally had been hopelessly compromised. 48. These instructions treated the matter as one of some urgency, but the Resident was to have regard also to the desirability of not provoking the sheikh to unfavourable reactions in other directions, e.g., in connexion with the then pending negotiations for an oil concession. In the event the communication was deferred until January 1935. 49. The question of an oil concession for the Koweit Neutral Zone, which can only be granted jointly by Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, also engaged much attention during the year. As it made no substantial progress, it will suffice to sum up the situation as it stood when it was discussed with Fuad Bey in London in September. 50. The Saudi Government had, when granting the Hasa concession to the Standard Oil Company of California in 1933, given that company an option in regard to their rights in the Neutral Zone. The terms of the option, which they disclosed confidentially to His Majesty’s Government in May 1934, were involved but gave the Standard Oil Company a definite hold. The Government nevertheless treated, as though they were free, with another concern which had been formed under the name of the Arabian Development Syndicate (Limited), and in which a Mr. Ydlibi of Manchester, a naturalised Briton of Syrian origin, and the Eastern and General Syndicate (Limited) were interested/ Early in the year, indeed, they went as far as they could go, without committing themselves in writing, towards promising the concession, so far as they were concerned, to the Ydlibi group. On the Koweit side, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were more vaguely interested in the eventual oil potentialities of the Neutral Zone, but they could not seek a concession there except on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company. In any case they were concentrating their attention on the negotiations for a concession in Koweit proper in favour of the Koweit Oil Company, a combination which had been arranged between themselves and the American Gulf Oil Company.13 [11812] b 7 51. The combined effect of these factors was a complete impasse as regards the Neutral Zone. The Saudi Government had created it by treating with two interests in succession without reference to the position of the Sheikh of Koweit. Fuad Bey urged strongly in London that TIis Majesty’s Government should help them to find a way out by promoting a combine of interests. ^Te threw out subsidiarily a suggestion that in the last resort the Neutral Zone might be divided. His Majesty’s Government were not disposed to move quickly as regards the Neutral Zone concession, partly because they were anxious to see the negotiations between the sheikh and the Koweit Oil Company brought to a successful conclusion, as they eventually were, but not until the 23rd December. The balance of opinion in British circles was against any division of the Neutral Zone, and it was eventually decided not to pursue this idea, unless Fuad Bey should revert to it. 52. It will be understood that the above is merely an attempt to summarise the main lines of transactions of a peculiarly tangled kind, involving, moreover, factors so remote from Jedda that it is difficult for the Legation to see all of them in their exact proportions. (B)— With Powers outside Arabia. (1) British Commonwealth of Nations. His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 53. The relations between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were on balance not less friendly in 1934 than in 1933. This statement is, however, more than ever subject to the qualifications indicated in paragraph 69 of the last report, where it was stated that ‘ ‘ the value in Ibn Sand’s eyes of the friendship shown by His Majesty’s Government is impaired by their policy of showing at least equal friendship to other Arab rulers, by their inability to give him material assistance, and to some extent by their hardness in regard to various matters, e.g., debts and slavery and as regards Ibn Saud’s own attitude, that “his friendship, in any case, is always coloured by Islamic feeling and Arab suspicion.” In 1934 the situation between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan practically ceased to trouble Anglo-Saudi relations, but other circumstances threatened them with an even greater eventual strain and gave the King even greater reason to regard the policy of His Majesty’s Government as being unforthcoming, harsh, and even, from his point of view, unjust. 54. During the early part of the year Ibn Saud’s whole outlook was dominated by his difficulties with the Yemen, and he did his best both to enlist the friendly interest of His Majesty’s Government in his cause and to avoid giving them offence. When H.M.S. Penzance arrived at Medi on the 27th April, the day after its occupation by Saudi forces, the Amir Feisal mishandled the situation and the King himself was perturbed, but he quickly came to see that British naval visits to ports which were only in his occupation should not be resented, whatever might be thought of similar Italian visits, so that at Hodeida the relations between His Majesty’s ships and the Saudi authorities were uniformly friendly (see paragraph 192 {a) below). In May the King, who had at certain earlier stages of the Yemen business deluged the Legation with bursts of confidence, caused Fuad Bey to press Sir Andrew Ryan hard as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the possibility of Italian inter vention. It was only with difficulty that he was headed off putting embarrassing questions in a very definite form. This delicate matter was removed from the sphere of practical politics by the termination of the war, but in the meanwhile a question much more directly affecting Anglo-Saudi relations had come into prominence. It was unfortunate that by a pure coincidence it arose when the King was at grips with the Imam and might easily suppose His Majesty’s Government to have chosen the moment purposely to take advantage of his embarrassment. The question was this. 55. Doubts had arisen in the latter part of 1933 (see paragraph 57 of the report for that year) as to what should be considered the southern boundary of14 the Sheikhdom of Qatar. This was one of a complex of problems, which owed their importance to the grant of the Hasa oil concession to the Standard Oil Company of California in 1933, to doubt as to how the eastern limits of that concession had been defined, and lo suspicion lest the Standard Oil Company might wish, perhaps with the support of Ibn Saud, to establish a footing in Qatar in opposition to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The latter already had^^ prospecting option in Qatar which, if it led to the grant of a concession, wouWi have enured to the benefit of the Iraq Petroleum Company. t 56. Study of the Qatar question led His Majesty’s Government to the conclusion that the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Ibn Saud’s dominions were determined legally by two lines, the blue and the violet, laid down in Anglo- Turkish conventions of i913 and 1914, and that, while the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs did not necessarily extend up to the north-to-south or blue line, the area beyond those lines must be regarded as a British sphere. His Majesty’s Government might have postponed asserting this position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud had not the United States Government made enquiries, which necessitated a statement to them of the British view as to the effect of the Anglo-Turkish conventions. It was considered advisable to inform the Saudi Government, “ as a matter of courtesy,” of the American enquiries and the reply given in as unprovocative a form as possible. This was done in a short but carefully considered note addressed by the Legation in Jedda to the Saudi Government on the 28th April. 57. The reaction of the Saudi Government in a note of the 13th May was strong, though they attempted to be conciliatory. They refused to admit that the Anglo-Turkish conventions of 1913 and 1914 had any valid application to the matter. They expressed no positive views of their own as to the frontier, but expressed readiness to discuss the matter at any time. A restatement of the British thesis in a note of the 15th June elicited a more reasoned statement of the Saudi case on the 20th June. They maintained that the Turkish Government could have had no locus standi in the matter after Ibn Saud’s occupation of Hasa on the 13th April, 1913. They invoked the first Anglo-Saudi Treaty of the 26th December, 1915, by which His Majesty’s Government had undertaken to recognise Ibn Saud’s sovereignty over the dominions of his ancestors. They intimated very extensive claims as to what those dominions were. 58. This was all the correspondence that passed between the two Govern ments. Its brutal frankness on both sides was mitigated by conversations about the same time in which Fuad Bey manifested on behalf of Ibn Saud anxiety for an exchange of views with a view to a co-ordination of policy in general and anxiety for a friendly settlement of the “ blue line question ” in particular. His Majesty s Government expressed readiness to give Fuad Bey a hearing during an informal visit which he expected to pay to London in the autumn. 59. Thus encoui aged to hope for the best, Ibn Saud made the spectacular gesture of asking Sir Andrew Ryan to visit him at Taif before proceeding to Lngland on leave. No non-Moslem foreign representative had gone there under r ^? e \ except when the French Charge went very inconspicuously in 1932. Lven Moslem representatives had not been very welcome The King having changed his course in this respect, excelled himself in personal courtesy to Sir Andrew Ryan and saw that his officials showed every attention appropriate to a semi-State occasion. At a series of audiences on the 13th July he discussed yanous questions. He spoke of his fears lest Iraq should be menaced by Turkey and/or Persia and lest he himself should be menaced as a result After some elucidatory discussion, he defined his idea as being that Saudi Arabia mirfit come to some arrangement with Iraq, under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government by which they would stand together and give each other undertakings not to stand against Great Britain or support any Power that went against her. Sir Andrew Byan broached two subjects. His explanation of His Majesty’s Government’s position in regard to the blue line drew from the King a most vehement statement of his own case. He was more amiable, but quite vague, about the Koweit blockade. He himself raised the question of his position vis-a-vis Bahrein and as has been described in paragraph 40, spoke with great bitterness of the attitude which he attributed to His Majesty’s Government.[11812] b 8 15 &amp; ■jr' 60. Fuad Bey Hamza arrived in London on the 18th September. On the following days he and the Saudi Minister conducted a series of conversations with Mr. Rendel, assisted by Sir Andrew Ryan and others. Though informal, they were of great importance, as they covered all major questions outstanding between the two Governments. Consideration was given, subject to higher approval on %)th sides, to the possibility of including a number of these questions in a comprehensive settlement to be negotiated after Sir Andrew Ryan’s return to Jedda. Space does not admit of a full account of the conversations in London, but the following paragraphs will give a general idea of the subjects discussed, with some account, where necessary, of their setting and an indication of the position reached by the end of the year. The order is that in which the questions were raised in the London conversations. As frequent reference is made to what was to happen after Sir Andrew Ryan’s return to Jedda, it may be well to state that, when he did return on the 13th December, Fuad Bey had left for Riyadh and was still there at the end of December. 61. Proposed Rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. —Fuad Bey was told, subject to approval, that His Majesty’s Government would view with sympathy any such rapprochement having for its object peace in Arabia, provided that account were taken of the existing obligations of the parties; but that they would not themselves wish to undertake new commitments, e.g., by becoming parties to any agreement between the two countries. Comforting replies in general terms were given to his remarks on Saudi apprehension in regard to the policy of Turkey and Persia. This portion of the conversations had no definite suite so'far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, but see paragraphs 11-12 above regarding direct Saudi-Iraqi relations. 62. Possible Similar Rapprochements with other Arab States. —Fuad Bey threw out a general enquiry as to His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in this respect. The reaction on the British side was guarded. He was reminded of the interest of His Majesty’s Government in a settlement of differences between Saudi Arabia and Koweit and their special position in regard to the Trucial Sheikhs, whom they would not wish to see reduced to the position of satellites to a more powerful neighbour. It may be noted that, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, the subject of Fuad Bey’s enquiry is closely bound up with the particular questions affecting Koweit, Bahrein and the other principalities in the Persian Gulf. From the point of view of the Saudi Government, however, the matter turns a good deal, though Fuad Bey did not venture to say so in London, on their dislike of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, which even in the attenuated form given to it in 1927 seems to them to affirm the concern of an alien Power in inter-Arabian affairs. 63. Blue Line .—Further study of this question had revealed some doubt as to the clearness of the legal situation, on which His Majesty’s Government had been relying. This and general considerations of policy made it advisable to hold out to Fuad Bey the hope that His Majesty’s Government might be prepared for an amicable settlement, without too much reference to strict legal considerations, if it could be made part of a general settlement of all major outstanding questions. Fuad Bey was pressed to obtain a positive statement of the King’s desiderata. In due course the Saudi Minister made communications from which it was clear that Ibn Saud, while making extensive claims, was unwilling to define them at all precisely. His Majesty’s Government on their side continued to examine the possible bases of a settlement which might be proposed without danger to their own interests and those of their clients in Eastern Arabia. The points for consideration were many and difficult, and His Majesty’s Government were still considering their policy in consultation with the Government of India and other British authorities at the end of the year. 64. Koweit Blockade.—The importance attached by His Majesty’s Govern ment to a settlement of this question was urged on Fuad Bey, who spoke sympathetically but vaguely and suggested that it was for His Majesty’s Govern ment to propose the lines of a settlement. See, as regards this question, paragraphs 43 ff. 65. Future of the Treaty of Jedda,.—This treaty became denunciable by either party at six months’ notice at any time from the 17th March, 1934, onward. The position had been discussed between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey in June16 on lines which indicated that, while neither Government wished to denounce the treaty, the Saudi Government hoped for satisfaction on certain points. When reverting to the subject in London Fuad Bey raised no new point, except the minor question of the language of the treaty, which was not then pursued. The other points really came under the head of individual outstanding questions and fall to be dealt with as such, from the point of view of His Majesty’s Governments^ The standpoint of the Saudi Government is rather different, as on the one hand the denunciability of the treaty affords them an opportunity of putting forward their desiderata, while on the other hand they would like, subject to obtaining some at least of their desiderata, to establish their treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government on a less precarious basis. 66. Slavery .—In earlier conversations with Sir Andrew Ryan, Fuad Bey had intimated that, if His Majesty’s Government would abandon the right of manumission provisionally preserved by the letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda, Ibn Saud might be prepared to promulgate regulations designed to prevent the slave trade and to protect slaves in the country from undue hardship. This idea was further discussed in London, very guardedly on the British side, but not so as to exclude the possibility of an agreement on the lines suggested. The Secretary of State subsequently issued instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan authorising him to explore the matter further on those lines but laying down stringent conditions, as to the information which would be required regarding the proposed legislation and the prospects of its being enforced effectively. Consideration has also been given to the possibility of bringing Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations system by securing her accession, at the instance of His Majesty’s Government or the League, to article 2 {a) of the International Slavery Convention of 1926. 67. Saudi-Transjordan Frontier.—TY iq position before Fuad Bey visited London was briefly as follows. He had reverted to the subject of the Aqaba-Maan legion (see paragraphs 22, 35 and 72 of the report for 1933) in language which implied that the Saudi Government, while maintaining their claim, did not intend to press seriously for a change in the modus vivendi established by the relevant letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda. The unostentatious survey of the Iransjordan-Heja 2 frontier, which was decided on in 1933 (see paragraph 33 oi the last report), had taken place and had been extended to a small southern sector of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier. The northern portion of the latter Iron tier was still the subject of some controversy with the Saudi Government notably as regards the important water-point of Hazim, but this controversy was no longer very active. A mention of the Aqaba-Maan area in the London conversations ed to a more general exchange of views with Fuad Bey who was not encouraged to reassert the Saudi claim to that area, but was sounded as to the Saudi view regarding a possible clarification of the situation in regard to both parts of the frontier. He took the line that, if the Aqaba-Maan question could not be settled, his Government would prefer not to discuss the de facto Trans- jordan-Hejaz frontier in any way whatsoever. He did not exclude the possibility ot a clarification, e.g., by a local commission, in regard to the Transiordan-Neid ron ler. Subsequent study of the question by the British authorities concerned turned fundamentally on the question whether the whole matter should be pursued m any general negotiations with the Saudi Government and if so on what lines t revealed the need for further information and arrangements were made for fronfe S wkb f )' p e S Tb y made ° n the J r « nsj ? rdan side of the ^ f^o trontier with the Hejaz. This was proceeded with notwithstandino- thp Thaniyya Taraif incident described in paragraph 169 below. At the end Sf the year His Majesty s Government were still considering the attitude to be fin all v adopted in regard to the whole question. ^ on., 6 a 8 ’ i lejaz Railway. —Fuad Bey had approached Sir Andrew Evan on the 30th April as to the probable attitude of His Majesty’s Government in the United r » dom the Saudi Government should formally approach them and the French Government with a proposal that a conference should be held to make arrange ments for reconditioning of the line, the question of its ownershin beinn sininlv reserved This led to an exchange of views with the French Government and other authorities concerned. When Fuad Bey reverted to the matter in London sufficient progress had been made to enable the British representatives to Gp! up a generally sympathetic attitude. No definite reply could'be returned how16$ [11812] B 9 17 ever, until November, when His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda informed the Saudi Government orally, under instructions, that His Majesty’s Government for their part saw no objection to the conference proposal being put forward and that, if it were, it would be considered in consultation with the French Government, subject to a clear understanding that the conference would be con- ducted on the basis of the Lausanne declaration (paragraph 72 of the annual report for 1930) and that it would be confined to technical questions. It was added that His Majesty’s Government and the French Government would probably consider it necessary to ensure agreement beforehand on the precise agenda. 69. External Telegraphic Communications of Saudi Arabia. —The Saudi Government have long been anxious to secure some modification of the Working Agreement concluded in 1926 between themselves and the Sudan Government as joint owners of the Jedda—Port Sudan cable and the Eastern Telegraph Company. They consider the rates provided in it too onerous. They dislike a clause which gives the Eastern Telegraph Company a monopoly, at any rate as regards the telegraphic communications of the Hejaz; and they dislike it all the more because of their hope in present circumstances of being able to develop external communi cation by wireless. The latter question came up in one particular form early in 1934 in consequence of an approach made to Cable and Wireless (Limited), who have a station at Bahrein, by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. It was thought undesirable in British circles that, if there were to be wireless communication between Hasa and the outer world, it should be handled at the Saudi end by a private American concern. His Majesty’s Government therefore conveyed to the Saudi Government in September an offer by Cable and Wireless (Limited) to provide in agreement with them, the Saudi Government, a service between the Saudi stations in Hasa and their own in Bahrein. Although this step almost coincided with Fuad Bey’s visit to London, it was taken indepen dently of that visit. The visit did, however, provide the opportunity for a more general discussion between him and the Saudi Minister in London and representatives of Cable and Wireless (Limited) under the auspices of the Foreign Office. There emerged from this discussion, which was informal and non-committal on both sides, a suggestion that definite negotiations for a general agreement to cover all the external telegraphic communications of Saudi Arabia might be undertaken in due course at Jedda. This was still in view at the end of the year, but progress was delayed by perturbation on the part of the company over a report that wireless communication had in the meantime been established between Riyadh and Basra. The particular question of a service between Hasa and Bahrein was also in suspense at the end of the year. 70. Bahrein Transit Dues. —The conversation with Fuad Bey on this subject is dealt with in paragraph 40 above. 71. Passage of Aircraft over Saudi Arabia. —Mr. Rendel reserved the possibility that His Majesty’s Government might wish to bring this question any general settlement. The Saudi Government, without lefening to this, subsequently expressed a wish to arrive at a final settlement on the subject, m the circumstances described in paragraph 168 below. 72. Government of India Dispensaries in the Hejaz. —The Saudi health authorities have more than once in the past displayed jealousy of the .position of the Government of India dispensaries in the Hejaz, which form part of the Legation. This attitude has manifested itself more particularly in connexion with the dispensary which is opened annually at Mecca for the pilgrimage season. Matters came to such a point in March 1934, partly owing to a muddle m the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, that Sir Andrew Ryan appealed to the King m a direct telegram. This put an end to the immediate difficulties in Mecca, but the Saudi Government contested all the more hotly the right of the British authorities to a continuance of the diplomatic privileges which the medical staff of the Legation in Jedda had enjoyed, and in particular the right to make any arrange ments in Mecca implying the maintenance of any sort of Legation establishment there. Acrimonious and unfruitful discussions with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in April were followed by a somewhat more hopeful exchange of views between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey in June, but owing to Fuad Bey’s illness and departure on leave they could not be pursued. In August, when his back was turned, the Saudi Government envenomed the situation by issuing a circular to the foreign missions,18 in which they asked that the missions should in future furnish separate statements of medical supplies imported for their “private ’’ use and those for other uses, in order that the latter should be dutied. His Majesty’s Government urged that the existing situation should be maintained intact pending a resumption of the discussions with Fuad Bey. Following on an inconclusive exchange of views when he came to London and on further correspondence in Jedda, the Saudi Governmentf^ eventually agreed to this proposal, and the discussion of the general question was left over until Fuad Bey and Sir Andrew Ryan could deal with it at leisure. 73. His Majesty's Government's Pecuniary Claims .—Fuad Bey was reminded of the importance which His Majesty’s Government attached to a settle ment of their claims and that of the Government of India (see paragraph 123 of the report for 1933). These had not been pressed during the acute stage in Saudi- Yemen relations, but Sir Andrew Ryan had reverted to the matter in conversation with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin in July. Fuad Bey countered what was said to him by a personal suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might promote the raising of a small Saudi loan in England to enable his Government to pay off their floating debt. Although a promise of consideration was given, the suggestion is not one which could bear fruit. As regards the claims, the position at the end of the year was exactly what it was at the end of 1933. 74. Nationality Question .—This was mentioned to Fuad Bey, but it was not pursued, as it appeared to be in a fair way towards settlement at Jedda (see paragraph 171). 75. Possible Entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations .—See paragraphs 107-8 below. 76. Koweit Neutral Zone Oil Concession .—This was the subject of two long and inconclusive conversations. The subject is sufficiently dealt with in paragraph 49 above. 77. This long sub-section must not be burdened with further details, but it may be mentioned that the usual courtesies during the year included an exchange of messages between Ibn Saud and Flis Majesty the King on the occasion of the marriage of the Duke of Kent and Princess Marina. Dominion Governments. 78. ^ No official questions arose between any of these Governments and the ^audi Government. The latter responded amiably to an informal request from Melbourne that they should provide a Saudi flag for display in connexion with the Victoria-Melbourne centenary celebration in November. The flag was sent to the Legation in Jedda under cover of an official note requesting that it should be forwarded. It is not known whether it reached Melbourne in time. (2) Franee and Syria. 79. Iheie was again no appearance of any important development in Franco-Saudi relations in 1934. The visit of M. Maigret, the French Charge d Attaires, to Riyadh, of which some account was given in paragraphs 77 and 78 ot the report for 1933, had no particular consequences. In the spring French sloops took part in the naval proceedings at Hodeida. Their presence there had less significance for the Saudi Government than that of the British and Italian ships, and was neither welcomed nor resented on its own independent merits, huad Bey Hamza visited Paris more than once in the autumn and was in Syria and th6 Lebanon, his homeland, for a couple of months later. Any conversations he had with French personages do not appear to have produced any important result, although he may have promoted the reported decision of the French Govern- ment to convert their consulate in Jedda into a Legation and to promote the present Charge d Affaires, M. Maigret, to the rank of Minister Resident. The Y^oq.ic !J 1S v!? e,?1S10 N ad ^ en taken was circulated privately towards the end of 1 9 34 by M. Maigret himself, and he gave Fuad Bey the credit for it; but no omciai announcement has been made up to the time of writing. 80. The fact is that the French Government still seem to have no particular policy m Saudi Arabia except that of being generally amiable, defending their quite minor non-political interests and keeping Ibn Saud sweet as regards Syria.19 [11812] b 10 In this last respect they have so far been successful; so much so that on the 5th July last the French High Commissioner in Syria felt able to inform a gathering of journalists that the King had promised not in any circumstances to interfere in the Syrian question. The future must, however, depend on many factors of which it is difficult to form a coherent picture in Jedda. The advance shadow of coming events may be seen in various occurrences in 1934. These need not be dealt with in detail, but some may be briefly enumerated. The year saw a notable rapprochement between Ibn Saud and cunning old Nuri ash-Sha’lan, the paramount chief of the Ruwalla tribe. The mission of Arab mediators mentioned in paragraph 32 included two personages of interest to the French in Syria, viz., Hashim-al-Atasi and Shakib Arslan. Another well-known Syrian politician, Dr. Jamil Mardam, turned up independently at the head of what purported to be a medical mission. He was supposed to have political objects and, inter alia, to be interested in the possible candidature of the Amir Feisal for that will o’ the wisp, “ the throne of Syria.” Fuad Bey Hamza, when in Syria in the autumn, is said to have been loud in his praise of France and the French, and very indiscreet in utterances regarding his sovereign’s designs on Transjordan. Finally, some political importance may attach to even so minor an event as the attendance of a Saudi representative at the Syro-Iraqi conference at Palmyra, which has been noted in paragraph 8. 81. The French Government are co-interested with His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom in the question of the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway, and were in agreement with the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the enquiry by the Saudi Government mentioned in paragraph 68 above. The French Charge is understood to have made in due course a communication similar to that made by Mr. Calvert. There is, nevertheless, reason to believe that the French authorities in Syria are by no means keen on seeing the railway reopened for through traffic. (3) Italy. 82. The relations between Italy and Saudi Arabia in the early part of 1934 were charged with black suspicion, owing to the known interest of the Italian Government in the cause of the Imam of the Yemen. The presence of Italian ships at Hodeida during the Saudi occupation was most repugnant to the Saudi authorities and was their greatest reason for disliking the presence of any foreign warships whatsoever. Some of the proceedings of the Italian authorities showed, moreover, a lack of tact which, without leading to any serious incident, did not help to allay suspicion on the Saudi side. 83. It is possible, as has been suggested in paragraph 33, that fear of Italian intervention was one of the causes which decided Ibn Saud to come to terms with the Imam, instead of continuing the war. The new Italian representative, who arrived in Jedda on the 25th March with no previous experience of Arabia, created a favourable impression by his own attitude, and made a definitely reassuring communication to the Saudi Government on the 12th May under instructions from his Government. It was not Italian assurances, however, but the conclusion of the Treaty of Taif that put an end to the situation, which had existed for so many years, of mistrust of the Italian policy of supporting the Imam. Ibn Saud might still perhaps have misgivings as to the general policy of Italy in the Red Sea, and might still suspect them of kindness to political exiles from the Hejaz, but no manifestation of discontent under these heads came to the notice of the British Legation after the Imam himself had relinquished the territorial claims which the Italian Government had been backing. 84. There were, indeed, notable signs of a general political rapprochement later in the year. When Fuad Bey Hamza left for Europe in July, the Italian Charge in Jedda was authorised to accompany him, and they voyaged from Port Sudan to Suez together in an Italian ship. Fuad Bey was expected to go first to Italy, but, owing to his illness, and possibly because Ibn Saud feared lest Italian effusiveness should make the visit seem too official, he did not finally reach Rome until the 9th September. He stayed three days and was received by Signor Mussolini in person. The interview was described in an Italian communique as cordial, and Fuad Bey, going further, said that it had produced much greater results than he had hoped for. He denied that relations had ever20 been bad, and was even quoted in the press as having stated that “ the presence of Italy on the Red Sea is a guarantee for us of equilibrium and peace.” 85. These exchanges gave rise to the usual talk of loans and so forth. It is possible that the Italians have some hope of extending their interests in Saudi Arabia. Fuad Bey’s visit provided one Italian paper with the text for an article on the importance of the Arabian and Central Asian markets. A member of the Italian Embassy in London spoke at the Foreign Office in October of the opportunities which Saudi Arabia might afford for the development of Italian “ cultural influence.” It is also possible that the welcome given to Fuad Bey in Rome was inspired by more purely political reasons and was part of the general Italian policy of thrust in the Middle East, a policy which is said to have taken the form of supporting the pan-Arab movement, with the exponents of which Fuad Bey is a good deal identified, however much he may be restrained by his responsibilities as the servant of a cautious King. In this connexion see paragraph 5 of this report. (4) Netherlands. 86. The relations between the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia continued throughout the year to be as amiable and as devoid of political interest as usual. Nothing worth mentioning was heard of Ibn Sand’s interest in the controversy between warring Moslem factions in the Dutch East Indies. His sympathies may be supposed to lie with Al-Irshad (see paragraph 85 of the last report), but Java is very far away and still interests him above all as a reservoir of potential pilgrims. He had the satisfaction in 1934 of seeing a hopeful increase in the number of Dutch East Indian pilgrims, though it again fell far short of the numbers in earlier years. There are no signs of his loving Al-Irshad enough to be tempted to interfere in the Hadhramaut any more than in Java. 87. The Dutch Charge d’Affaires in Jedda paid yet another visit to Sana in March for the exchange of ratifications of the treaty which he had concluded with the Imam in 1933. The moment was perhaps awkward for a visit by a representative at Ibn Saud’s court to Ibn Saud’s enemy, but there were no signs of Saudi displeasure. It may be mentioned that on this occasion the Charge took with him a representative of Dutch shipping interests in Jedda, a surveyor from Holland and a Dutch doctor. The idea may have been to spy out the economic possibilities of the Yemen. (5) Soviet Russia. 88. Political relations between Saudi Arabia and the Soviet appeared to be completely stagnant in 1934. There was no notable development in the commercial relations, about which there had been so much talk early in 1933 (see paragraphs 86 to 88 of the last report), but the Soviet Minister still pays not infrequen? visits to Mecca and seems to cultivate Saudi personages, like the Minister of Finance. 89. In the course of the summer the Soviet Government sent a present of automatic telephone apparatus to Ibn Saud with one or more experts to demon strate its use. As the experts knew no Arabic this afforded a pretext for allowing the Russian Minister to go to Taif ostensibly to interpret for them. In the event he stayed there for a considerable portion of the autumn, living quite quietly it would appear, and uninterfered with by the Saudi authorities. He was accompanied by his non-Moslem wife, who wore a veil and disliked it, but who having some medical knowledge, was apparently given access on that score to Ibn Saud’s ladies. The whole episode deserves less attention as a phase in Saudi Soviet relations than as an example of a partial change in Ibn Saud’s attitude towards visits by foreign representatives to the interior. Compare paraoraph 59 regarding Sir Andrew Ryan’s visit to Taif. nor 90. The employment of certain White Russians in the Saudi air force is mentioned in paragraph 162. 91. (6) Germany. Germany remained unrepresented in Jedda during the year. Her commercial inteiests continue to be small. One occasionally hears of a possible or probable German interest in supplies of arms, &amp;c., but they are not shipped from Germany nor are they handled by Germans at the Saudi end.21 (7) Poland. 92. Poland has no representation in Saudi Arabia, but a Polish gentleman visited Jedda in January in the hope of coming to some arrangement about the debt mentioned in paragraph 100 of the last report. Jhe Saudis weie piepared -^to do business on the basis of obtaining fresh credit in return for payment or part payment of that debt. The negotiations failed in spite of the activity or Mr. Philby, who holds a sort of watching brief for the Poles and who was much concerned in this particular affair. (8) Egypt. 93 No palpable advance was made in 1934 towards a settlement of the differences which prevent the establishment of normal relations between Pgypt and Saudi Arabia. There appears to be an important body of political opinion in Egypt in favour of this, but the personal prejudice of King Fuad still blocks the way. In August there was much talk of a note which the Egyptian Govern ment were said to have addressed to the Saudi Government, but the report that such a note had been sent was denied in September. A new Egyptian represen tative was appointed to Jedda in August, but he does not seem to be an othcial ot much standing and he had not arrived up to the end of December. 94 The Saudi Government on their side affect a good deal of indifference, although they would welcome the establishment of normal relations. They were perturbed in May to learn that the Imam Yahya had sought the mediation ot King Fuad in his quarrel with Ibn Saud. Their fears were dissipated by the action of King Fuad himself in declining the Imam’s request. Later m the year, Ibn Saud defined his position in an interview which he gave to an Egyptian journalist. He denied the existence of any Saudi prejudice against Egyptians, with whom his country had ties of religion, of common Arab nationality and ot interest He said he had worked for agreement and minimised the questions which stood in the way, ignoring altogether, if the published version can be trusted, the question of the Sacred Caravan. 95 The commercial drive initiated in 1933 by Talaat I asha Harb and the Banque Misr group (paragraph 93 of the last report) continued with some intensity A conspicuous building was rented in Jedda; the bulk of the Egyptian pilgrims were carried in a former British ship belonging to the group; two smaller vessels made experimental voyages in the Red Sea later; Talaat 1 asha himse f revisited Jedda, with a party containing other persons of some consequence, towards the end of November, travelling by air. He was again well received but is said to have been refused permission to fly to Riyadh to see Ibn Saud. Some of his projects in connexion with banking, concessions, &amp;c., seem to hang hre and little has been heard of the marketing of Egyptian goods in the Hejaz, probably because of the difficulty of competing with Japanese goods. On the other hand, the group are giving great attention to the pilgrimage. Talaat Pasha is credited with a statement that they hoped to carry 8,000 pilgrims (according to another version 10,000) in 1935, and there has been talk of plans for various facilities like the issue of inclusive tickets covering the whole cost of the pilgrimage. Plans were made to provide hotel accommodation for pilgrims of the wealthier class in the Banque Misr building in Jedda. (9) Turkey. 96. Even less was heard in 1934 than in 1933 about Turkish relations with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Government were alarmed in the summer by the appearance of a rapprochement between Turkey and Persia, in which they professed to see an eventual menace to Iraq and through Iraq to themselves. When speaking of this apprehension, however, they represented their existing relations with Turkey as entirely correct and friendly. (Cf. paragraphs 09 and 61.) At the end of the year some attention was attracted by an entertainment 'iven by the Saudi Minister of Finance for the Turkish Charge d Affaires. It was said that the Saudi Government desired a commercial treaty with Turkey and that Turkey sought a monopoly of the import trade m certain lines. I he story is worth mentioning, but need not be taken seiiously at piesent. [11812] 81122 (10) Persia. 97. A new Persian representative arrived in Jedda in January. He proved to have been appointed a full Minister, but this increase in the standing of the head of the mission produced no apparent change in the negative character of the relations between the two countries. Saudi apprehensions in regard to the^ eventual policy of Persia have been mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It may be noted in this connexion that, when giving expression to Ibn Saud’s anxiety in London, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned the Persian claim to Bahrein and the creation of a Persian navy in the Persian Gulf. He defined his view as being that as an Arab he would like to see Bahrein develop into an independent Arab unit, but he had no desire in the meantime to see Persia establish a claim in opposition to His Majesty’s Government. (11) Afghanistan. 98. The Afghan Minister at Cairo comes every year on pilgrimage. Advantage was taken of this to exchange the ratifications of the Saudi Afghan Treaty of the 5th May, 1932, in Mecca on the 1st April, 1934. The treaty was, in due course, published. It presented few features of special interest. There was no other development in the political relations between the two countries. A gentleman who was believed to be a new Afghan consul in Bombay visited the Hejaz as a pilgrim and was understood to have inherited the consular position in Jedda, which had been conferred on his predecessor at Bombay in 1933. No official announcement was made, however. He stayed a very short time and did not reveal himself as a consul, except by asking for special facilities for his return voyage to India. Saudi interest in stimulating the pilgrimage from Afghanistan may have had something to do with the visit to Kabul of a member of the Moslem firm which represents Messrs. Turner, Morrison, and Co. of Bombay at Jedda, but it was probably at least as much due to the commercial interest of the company in getting as many pilgrims as possible to use their ships. (12) Ethiopia. 99. An Ethiopian mission visited first the Yemen and then the Hejaz in June and July. It was headed by M. David Hall, a gentleman of mixed European (but not British) and Abyssinian origin. He apparently brought letters from the Emperor of Abyssinia expressing his regret that Ibn Saud and the Imam were at war and his hopes for the early termination of hostilities. This hope had been realised before the mission reached Taif, and if it had any less altruistic objects, such as the conclusion of a treaty, as was suggested, it was not achieved. The party were very civilly received and departed with great celerity. Its chief interest for the Saudi Government was that they believed it to be the first Ethiopian mission to visit Arabia since the beginnings of Islam, when the Prophet and his followers had curious and friendly relations with the Negus. (13) The United States of America. 100. No further steps were taken in 1934 to develop the meagre political relations described in previous reports or to appoint an official representative of the United States in Saudi Arabia. The only important American interest in the country is still that of the subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California concerned in the Hasa Oil Concession. A short account of its activities will be given in paragraph 139 below. 101. Reference is made in paragraph 56 to the interest displayed by the United States Government in the question of Ibn Saud’s eastern boundaries. Their enquiries, which were made in Angora, were obviously connected with the position of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. The company’s local representatives on at least one occasion crossed the blue line ” in the course of their prospecting.23 /o 102. One amusing incident may be mentioned. Early in the year the United States Minister at Bagdad visited Muscat and airily announced his intention of running up to Riyadh to see Ibn Saud. He reckoned without his host, who firmly though tactfully turned him down. This must be attributed to motives of general policy rather than to any dislike of Americans. Indeed, Dame, an American missionary doctor at Bahrein, is a not infrequent visitor to the King, who has a high opinion of his medical abilities. 1 (14) Japan and Manchukuo. 103. The Saudi-Yemen war seems to have attracted a good deal of attention in Tokyo, where several articles dealing with it and with Saudi Arabia were published. There is some tendency in Saudi circles to be impressed by recent indications of Japanese interest in Islam and Islamic countries, even by rumours that Japan may be going Moslem. The Minister of Finance is reported to have acclaimed Japan, in private conversation, as the greatest of countries and a potential exporter of pilgrims. There has, however, been no confirmation of a report circulated in the autumn about the proposed appointment of a certain Muhammad As-Saqqaf as Japanese consul in Saudi Arabia. This report was denied in Tokyo. 104. For the moment greater importance attaches to the interest shown by Japan in trade with Arabia. Japanese goods of various kinds, especially piece- goods, find their way indirectly to the Hejaz and are in considerable demand. The Japanese drive has manifested itself more directly in the Persian Gulf, which has been visited by Japanese merchants and has begun to be frequented by Japanese ships. Cargoes carried in these vessels to Bahrein in the autumn were in part intended for transhipment to the Hasa coast. 105. In March the Saudi Government sought British advice both in Jedda and London regarding a telegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo announcing the proclamation of the new Emperor and expressing a hope for normal relations with Saudi Arabia. They were informed of the attitude of Great Britain and all the other League of Nations Powers, except Japan, as regards non-recognition, but they were given no formal advice. It is not known what, if any, action they took. (15) Other Powers. 106. There is little or nothing to record under this head. The Vatican continues to include all Arabia in the province of successive Apostolic Delegates for Palestine, Egypt, &amp;c. It should have been mentioned in the last report that in May 1933 the Czechoslovakian consul at Jerusalem was appointed consul for Saudi Arabia also, but did not visit the latter country in that year. He again did not appear in 1934, but a certain amount of Czechoslovakian trade precedes the flag. Some irritation was caused in the French consulate at Jedda and some amusement in other circles in December when the French Moslem, Colonel Ibrahim Depui, a man who has played many roles, military, official and other, in Arabia and the surrounding countries, let it be known at the outset of his latest visit that he wished to resume his position as Belgian consul, which he claimed to have formerly held. The French Charge d’Affaires, who now looks after Belgian interests, declined to recognise the claim in the absence of any notification from higher authority. (C)— Position in regard to the General International System and the League of 'Nations. 107. The Saudi Government were too greatly preoccupied with the internal affairs of Arabia in 1934 to make any real forward move towards participation in the life of the international community as a whole, even had they been disposedvm 24 to abandon the attitude of aloofness described in earlier reports. The question of their possible candidature for membership of the League of Nations was not pursued with His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda. It remained in abeyance in London also, except that in the course of his conversations at the Foreign Office in September Fuad Bey Hamza intimated that his Government might feel inclined to raise it during the suggested negotiations with His Majesty’s#^-- Government in the United Kingdom for a settlement of important outstanding questions. He suggested that such a settlement would remove one difficulty which had been mentioned in earlier discussions of this particular matter, namely, the uncertainty of the boundaries of Saudi Arabia. To a remark that the continued existence of slavery in that country had also been regarded as a possible obstacle to its entry into the League, he replied that that subject would also come into the suggested general negotiations. 108. Fuad Bey spent two days in Geneva in the course of his European tour, but it is not known what he did there. Later in the year a Damascus newspaper recorded an interview given by him to a journalist, who reminded him that the Hejaz had been one of the founders of the League, and enquired as to the intentions of the Saudi Government in regard to this part of their heritage from the previous regime. Fuad turned aside the subject of an inherited position, and to a direct question as to the present intentions of his Government, replied : “ It is possible that this question is now under discussion.” 109. The following isolated points may be briefly mentioned : — (a) The Saudi Government were perhaps represented at the meeting of the International Health Office in Paris in the spring and were certainly represented at that held in October. On the 21st September they published a communique making the International Sanitary Conven tion executory in Saudi Arabia, with the exception of a large number of articles. Subsequent enquiry showed that the decree mentioned in the communique did not contemplate ratification of the convention as an international instrument but its adoption, subject to reservations in regard to the excepted articles, as a piece of domestic legislation. (b) Elaborate regulations on the trade in narcotic drugs were promulgated in September. They did not refer to the international agreements on the subject but were doubtless partly inspired by them (see paragraph 173 below). (c) The Saudi agent in Cairo represented the Saudi Government at the International Postal Congress held there in February and March 1934. He signed the seven agreements concluded on the 20th March, and provision for their ratification was made by a decree of the 12th August, 1934. (d) The Saudi Government acknowledged in sympathetic terms the receipt of two reports on locust outbreaks in Africa and Western Asia, prepared under the auspices of the Economic Advisory Council and forwarded through the Legation. They declined, however, an invitation to take part in an international locust conference which it was proposed to hold in London in September. The most interesting feature of this refusal was that they apparently intended at one period to take part as observers, but abandoned even this intention in consequence of some muddle between them and the Yemeni Government, who had requested that the Saudi representative should represent the Yemen also (see paragraph 32 above as regards possible diplomatic collaboration). (e) The Saudi Government accepted in February an invitation to take part in the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, which was held in London early in the autumn, and which, though approved by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, had no official character. The Saudi Minister sent his first secretary to represent him at the opening meeting, but it is not known what, if anything, further he did to show the interest of his Govern ment in the sciences in question.25 (D)— Treaties. 110. The only treaties concluded by Ibn Baud in 1934 were those shown in the attached table, in which the numbering used in previous reports is continued :— No. With. Place and Date of Signature. Nature and Subject. Place and Date of Exchange of Ratifi cations. Date of Entry into Force. Remarks. 39 Multilateral Cairo, March 20, 1934 Seven Postal Con ventions concluded at the 10th Inter national Postal Congress No details yet avail able in Jedda, but the Saudi ratifica tion was provided for as stated in paragraph 109 (c). 40 Yemen Taif, May 20, 1934 Treaty of Islamic Friendship and Arab Brotherhood, terminating the state of war be tween the parties, determining fron tiers and providing for their future re lations Hodeida, June 22, 1934 June 22, 1934, but see next column With an Arbitration Covenant and six letters attached. The treaty termi nated the state of war as from the date of signature. It abrogated the earlier treaty of December 25,1931, No. 29, as to the validity of which doubt had existed. 111. The only other change in the treaty position of Saudi Arabia was that ratifications of the treaty with Afghanistan signed at Jedda on the 5th May, 1932, No. 35 in the Legation list, were exchanged at Mecca on the 1st April, 1934. 112. The amended note attached to the appendix to the annual report for 1932 requires fuller amendment as follows : “ Soviet Russia and the Netherlands maintain accredited representatives at Jedda without having concluded formal treaties with Ibn Saud. He has been recognised formally by at least two States, Switzerland and Poland, which neither have treaties with him nor maintain representatives. There may possibly be other cases in which such recognition has had no important suite. In certain cases recognition may be inferred, in the absence of treaties or the appointment of representatives, from other acts, e.g., the nominal appointment of a Czechoslovakian consul (see paragraph 108) and the despatch of an Ethiopian mission (see paragraph 99). Egypt has not so far recognised Ibn Saud, but maintains a representative of consular status in Jedda. ” III.— Internal Affairs. General Situation. 113. It is as impossible, as usual, for lack of trustworthy information, to give any coherent general account of the internal situation in Saudi Arabia in 1934. There were no spectacular developments except those in the immediate neighbourhood of the Yemen frontier which preceded the war. No symptoms of disaffection were reported from the towns. If there was discontent among the tribes in Nejd or the Ilejaz, it neither manifested itself in open rebellion nor prevented the King from levying forces sufficient to man the front during the Saudi-Yemen war. Reference has been made in paragraph 2 to the view expressed in Koweit in the autumn that Ibn Saud had lost prestige among his own people owing to his failure to impose more drastic terms on the Imam. This theory derived some support from the action of the paramount chief of the Rashaida tribe, who had in June reverted from his allegiance to Ibn Saud to an older allegiance to the Sheikh of Koweit. On the other hand, there were signs later that the King’s policy of attracting erstwhile rebels back to their loyalty was succeeding. The most notable case, perhaps, was that of Khalid-bin-Hithlain, one26 of a leading family of the Ajman tribe, who were much concerned in the Nejd rebellion of 1929. This “ debonair and handsome young warrior ” was long a refugee in Iraq, burning with a desire for some chance of moving against Ibn Sand. In December 1934 he passed through Koweit on his way back to Nejd, having, he said, made honourable terms with the King, but realising that he would no longer be free. 114. Fear of trouble with tribes in the north-west may have had something to do with the marked rapprochement between Ibn Saud and Nuri-bin-Sha’lan, to which a passing reference has been made in paragraph 80 above. Nuri’s tribe, the Ruwalla, have a wide range and, though now most closely associated with Syria, where Nuri normally resides, they were once a power of some political importance in the Jauf area. They are said to have offered Ibn Saud 20,000 men to serve on the Yemen front; more credibly to have promised him support, if he should have tribal trouble in the neighbourhood of the Transjordan frontier. Be this as it may, Nuri’s grandson and destined successor, Fawwaz, visited the King at the time of the pilgrimage and again towards the end of the year. Another grandson, Nawwash, who is said not to be on good terms with Nuri and Fawwaz and to have come to Saudi Arabia for that reason, spent even more of the year in the King’s entourage. At the end of the year, it was freely reported that the Sha’lans had done a deal with Ibn Saud, which would enable them to establish themselves in his country without restriction, perhaps to re-establish themselves in the Jauf area itself. 115. This leads up to an account of one particular element in the internal situation which had long been developing and which attracted much attention in the latter part of the year. Mention was made in the report for 1933 of the anger said to have been aroused in the Teima oasis by a demand on the part of Ibn Saud that its quasi-independent sheikh, Abdul-Kerim-bin-Rumman, should consent to the erection of a Saudi wireless station and accept the position of a paid Saudi Governor. Reports early in 1934 indicated, not for the first time, that Ibn Rumman was apprehensive of possible action by Ibn Saud. He appeared to be seeking tribal support in various directions besides maintaining correspondence with the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, with whom he has a connexion of long standing. As the situation between Ibn Saud and the Yemen became more acute, it was suggested that Ibn Rumman and certain named tribal chieftains had formed a definite anti-Saudi combine. 116. If the tribal chieftains concerned in this business ever seriously contemplated revolt, they were doubtless discouraged by the settlement with the Yemen and perhaps by the rapprochement between Ibn Saud and Ibn Sha’lan, After June little was heard of those chieftains but much of the continued alarm of Ibn Rumman, whose fears were said to have been restimulated in May by a raid of Harb tribesmen on his flocks, though he had repulsed it. Other raids and counter-raids were reported later. By September it looked as though serious trouble were brewing. Rumours current in Jedda of Saudi military preparations were confirmed by very precise reports which reached Jerusalem. The King’s cousin Ibn Musaid, Governor of Hail, had, it was said, been put in charge of measures against Teima. Ibn Rumman was said to be preparing for vigorous resistance. Saudi posts were established between Jauf and the track of the Hejaz Railway. A Saudi aeroplane went north about the beginning of November. 117. These rumours of impending trouble and the suggestion that Teima could be regarded as independent or semi-independent were scouted in Saudi circles. Whatever the reason, nothing of an impressive nature came of all the alleged preparations. In November it was suggested that Ibn Saud had stayed his hand and given Ibn Rumman four months within which to submit. Up to the end of the year nothing further was heard, but alleged Saudi concentrations at Hail and Jauf were again mentioned in a report from Damascus early in January 1935, a report which did not specifically connect them with Teima but with talk of growing disaffection towards Ibn Saud. 118. It appears to be certain that Teima is a thorn in Ibn Saud’s side, and jt may well be asked why so strenuous a ruler should tolerate it. One suggestion is that during the final struggle between the King and the Hashimites Ibn Rumman transferred his support from the latter to Ibn Saud, and that27 Ibn Saud gave him guarantees, supported by an oath, that he would not interfere with Teima. Another explanation is that Ibn Rumman has not only got walls but three field pieces, and that it would require artillery to reduce him. 119. It cannot be affirmed that Ibn Saud has no internal troubles to cope g^with. One hears increasingly of missions of inspection, investigation and reorganisation being sent hither and thither. These may sometimes be intended to allay discontent, as in the case of one sent to the Southern Hejaz in or about August to deal with complaints that over-taxation had reduced tribes there to a penury so great that they could no longer pay. Other missions may be directed to the task of organising the Saudi administration in areas where it has been imperfect or areas like Asir and Najran, in which the authority of Ibn Saud was at last definitely affirmed by the Saudi-Yemen Treaty of May 1934. 120. Whether his troubles be great or small, the King showed no outward signs in 1934 of being discomposed by them. He departed little from his ordinary routine during his quarrel with the Yemen and after it. He moved from Nejd to Mecca for the pilgrimage in March; from Mecca to his summer capital at Taif in May; and from Taif back to Riyadh in September to distribute largesse to those who had fought for him. 121. One of Ibn Saud’s most notable successes during his recent career has been that he has reduced to impotence or even bound to his cause families who were in the past his enemies. He could boast to Sir Andrew Ryan in July that the descendants of the Bani Rashid of Hail were with his own sons at the front, and that the sons of Feisal-ad-Dawish, his doughtiest opponent in the 1929 rebellion, were there too. When he obtained the surrender of the Idrisis of Asir, he could afford to allow them to reside in the Hejaz, instead of putting them in cold storage in Riyadh. One of the great questions now is whether his system can stand strains at the centre. Ibn Saud himself has lost some of his grip on the machine of government. The bouts of hunting and pleasure may be taking too much out of him at the age of 55. Many tales are told of dissension in the Royal family. They are too highly coloured to be all true, but there are fairly definite indications that the intended succession of the King’s eldest son is not received with favour by other princes, despite their acceptance of it in 1933. Apart from these family differences, there is a more or less clearly defined division of opinion in the King s entourage between those who believe that Saudi Arabia should be run on old- fashioned lines under the personal rule of the King and those who would like to see her institutions and the whole system modernised. Constitutional Development and Administration. 122. Nothing was heard during the year of any steps to give effect to the decision mentioned in paragraph 114 of the report for 1933 to provide a single Constitution for the whole of Saudi Arabia. It is possible that this unpractical proposal has been shelved. There has, however, been some tendency to regard the constitutional machinery at present in existence as being, for certain purposes, concerned with the whole country and not only with the Hejaz, as when a single decree established the same customs tariff for both sides of Ibn Saud s dominions. 123. At least two changes were made in the central machinery in 1934. A decree published on the 22nd June merged the Ministry of the Interior in the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. The language of the decree was somewhat obscure, leaving it doubtful whether it was a merger of administrative services only or whether the post of Minister of the Interior, as such, had ceased to exist. As the Amir Feisal had previously been both President of the Council and • Minister of the Interior, as well as' Minister for Foreign Affairs, there was no change in high places to elucidate this problem. Subsequent decrees mentioned the Ministry of the Interior, as though it still existed, but even that cannot be regarded as certain evidence in a country in which draughtmanship is so sloppy. The other change was the appointment of the Minister of Finance in September to the additional post of Deputy Minister of Defence, a post which would appear to have been thereby newly created. 124. The consultative Legislative Council deserves a word, because of its industry and the continuousness of its existence on the lines laid down in the present Constitution. Though of little real present importance it might conceivably serve as the embryo of a more effective Council of State in a more orderly constitutionalgovernment. On the conclusion of its Inst two years session at the end of A.H. 1353 (the 14th April, 1934) it presented a report on its activities. This showed that it had considered numerous regulations of every kind, some of which, though not all, can be identified with enactments promulgated in due course, besides a limited number of minor budgets. It has also taken some 500 decisions on administrative matters, reviewed the proceedings of the special^ commercial court or Majlis-at-Tujjar in Jedda and concerned itself, jointly with the special commission ad hoc, with pilgrimage affairs. The King opened a new session of the Council, the composition of which remained as before, on the 21st April. 125. What is more important than all this playing about with constitutional and legislative forms at the centre, is the fact that all the principal provisional governors, who, under the King, wield authority on old-fashioned lines, remained the same in 1934 as at the end of 1933; the King’s cousins Ibn Jiluwi and Ibn Musaid at Hasa and Hail respectively; members of the Sadairi family, his connexions by marriage, at Jauf and Abha; a strong, fanatical and arbitrary old Nejdi at Medina; and an amiable young scion of the princely house of Ayaina, once the equals of the Bani Sand, in Jedda. 126. So little is known in Europe of the administrative system of Saudi Arabia, that it has seemed worth while to add as an appendix to this report, a summary of the section of Fuad Bey Hamza’s book, published in 1933, which deals with the subject. IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. Finance. 127. There was no material change in the unhappy financial situation of Saudi Arabia in 1934. Its most remarkable feature was that money was found by hook or by crook to meet the comparatively heavy expenditure entailed by a war even in Arabia and that the King was able in the autumn to distribute to those tribesmen who had served him loyally, amounts in cash estimated at £100,000 gold or more, apart from the cost of their entertainment at Riyadh. So far as foreign suppliers were concerned, the Government were more punctual in their payments than they have often been in the past. 128. Where the money came from is a mystery. It could be accounted for to a small extent by the appreciable, but not great, increase in the number of overseas pilgrims, and by a further payment of £20,000 gold, plus £5,000 annual rental, by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in the summer. No other important sums of money are known to have come from external sources, except perhaps something from the Banque Misr and its associates on account of quarantine dues to be paid in due course in respect of the numerous pilgrims whom they hoped to transport from Egypt in 1935. There may be more truth than previously seemed probable in the suggestion that the King had been accumu lating a gold reserve at Riyadh. There is almost certainly no truth in the belief entertained by some, notably by Mr. Philby, that His Majesty extracted a secret war indemnity from the Yemen (see paragraph 34). 129. It is impossible to say whether additional revenue resulted from known fiscal legislation. The changes of most apparent importance were a revision of the customs tariff and the institution of a licence tax on all persons engaged in trade or other avocations in the towns. The first of these measures fixed flat rates of specific duty for rice, wheat and flour, which had previously been differentiated according to quality. It also provided specific duties for a large number of articles, which had previously been taxed under general headings in the list of goods subject to specific duty or had been dutied ad valorem. The second measure provided that all persons engaged in trade or professions should be divided into four categories and take out licences costing £2 gold, £1 gold, £^ gold and gold according to the category. Another decree provided that an extra “National First-Aid stamp,” value ^-piastre miri, should be affixed to all letters, petitions and documents already liable to stamp duty. Other enactments of less apparent importance dealt with judicial and notarial fees and the regulation on the Coast-Guard Administration, mentioned in paragraph 175 below, had attached to it an impressive list of dues of various kinds./ 29 130. It is probable that pressure on the taxpayer had a greater effect on revenue than new legislation. The Director of Finance of Hasa boasted privately in May that he had increased the revenue of that province tenfold. Mention has already been made of tribesmen in the Southern Hejaz, who complained that their capacity to pay had been exhausted by the exactions of the authorities. Levies ‘in the nature of forced loans may have been imposed in certain towns, but the evidence of this is fragmentary and not entirely convincing. 131. Drafts on customs, a method of anticipating revenue from the duties on newly imported goods, continued to be used in certain cases despite half hearted attempts to get away from the system. They seemed to be still fairly widely held in December, when alarm was created by a report that they were to be refused at the custom-house, a report, which if true, was followed by the abrogation of the decision. 132. There were probably certain attempts to administrative economy, and in any case official salaries displayed their usual tendency to fall into arrear. It was said early in the year that certain arrears had been written off altogether and a cut would appear to have been applied to current salaries. 133. The above review suggests various possible explanations of how the Minister of Finance contrived to weather a difficult period. There is so little publicity and so little uniformity of method or orderliness that the financial position can only be indicated in the general terms that have been used. No general budget has been published since the simulacrum of one in January 1932. In the Report mentioned in paragraph 124 above, the Legislative Council naively admitted that, while they had dealt with some subsidiary budgets, no general budgets had, under higher orders, been submitted to them during the two years under review, ending in April 1934. 134. No effort was made to deal with the floating debt. In particular, the position regarding the debts to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India remained unchanged (see paragraph 73 above). 135. The monetary situation also underwent no important change. It was thought that the silver riyal might slump after the pilgrimage, which sends up its value temporarily owing to the demand for currency. It remained, however, unexpectedly steady, although, as before, at rates far below its theoretical legal value of 10 to the English gold pound. The approximate market rates were 24 to the pound gold on the 31st December, 1933, 23 on the 31st March, 1934, i.e., in the height of the pilgrimage season, 24| on the 31st July, and 22J at the end of the year. Economic Conditions and, Development. 136. Internal economic conditions remained much the same as in 1933. No material is available for a coherent picture of conditions in this respect in tribal areas. Rain came late in the winter of 1933-34, but it did come at last in a good part of the northern regions of Saudi Arabia. It came early and plentifully in the winter of 1934-35. More need not be said except that the Saudi Yemen war too must have produced its effects. It helped to produce or to prolong an unusual dislocation of the tribes in the north-east. It brought the King’s bounty in the autumn to those who had fought for him. It intensified the exactions of the tax collectors in at least one area, namely, the part of the Southern Hejaz already mentioned, and doubtless elsewhere. Little was heard of the state of affairs in the more remote towns. Mecca and Jedda may have been a little less depressed. Black poverty continued to prevail in and around Medina. It was announced in November that the King had ordered seed to be distributed in certain areas in order that advantage might be taken of the early rains. 137. Much was again heard of projects, mostly, though not all, vague, to develop the resources of Saudi Arabia. The ex-Khedive of Egypt was no longer in the picture, but his former henchman, Abdul Hamid Shedid, had the nerve to return to Jedda in January. Purporting to represent a concern called the Hejaz Development Corporation (Limited), he propounded a modified scheme for a30 State bank to be created with British capital in return for concessions. The promoters of the scheme in London were not people to inspire confidence, and there was doubt both as to the reality of the support which they claimed to have enlisted and as to the value of that support if it were given. Impressive names were thrown about, but they seem to be thought less impressive in the City London than might be inferred from the pages of Who’s Who. Nothing^**' definite came of the activities of this corporation in 1934, but it was still in being at the end of the year. 138. Another concern, named the Arabian Development Syndicate (Limited), the prime mover in which was Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi of Manchester, had its own scheme for a bank and its owm hopes of concessions not only for oil in the Koweit Neutral Zone, in connexion with which it has already been mentioned in paragraph 50, but for oil anywhere else and for anything else that might be going. This syndicate also achieved nothing definite during the year. 139. If ink were oil, the quantity of it in the Legation files on that great subject for 1934 would keep a kerosene lamp alight for an appreciable time. Most of the correspondence, however, related to prospects and projects in surrounding areas, notably Kbweit and Qatar. Any developments in those areas might have important reactions in Saudi Arabia, but do not directly concern the Legation in Jed da except as regards the Koweit Neutral Zone. So far as Saudi Arabia itself was concerned, the position can be summed up briefly. The subsidiary company formed by the Standard Oil Company of California under the name of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company worked actively in Hasa under the concession granted in 1933. The work consisted mainly of preparatory surveying, and in the latter part of the year of preparations to start drilling at Jebel Dhahran, a few miles from the coast at the northern end of the Gulf of Bahrein. The company maintains a permanent office in Jedda. The surveying covered a wide area and was facilitated by the use of an aeroplane, for which the Saudi authorities gave permission after some hesitation. 140. In March and April one of the principal geologists of the Standard Oil Company of California, a Dr. Nomland, came to Jedda and made a tour of the Northern Hejaz to spy out the oil potentialities of that area. It also interests Mr. Ydlibi and his associates, who claimed that, while Ibn Saud was willing to let the Americans inspect the area, he had no intention of giving them a concession there and had as good as promised it to Mr. Ydlibi. Nothing definite came of all this nor of further talk of a concession for the Farsan Islands and Asir. 141. Another American, Mr. Twitched, who has been frequently mentioned in previous reports, reappeared in Jedda in June as the representative of a newly-formed company, the Saudi Arabian Mining Syndicate (Limited). This appears to be a respectable concern, made up of a combination of numerous interests, mostly British, each of which has contributed a moderate amount of capital. After arduous negotiations, Mr. Twitched obtained in December a concession to prospect for metallic minerals of ad kinds in an area of varying depth extending from Birk in Asir to the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier. Gold is the principal objective, and immediately after getting the concession Mr. Twitched started making active preparations for an intensive prospecting campaign in the country inland from Yanbu. If his hopes of gold are realised, the Saudi Government will make a good thing out of it eventually, as they are to be given gratis 15 per cent, of the full share capital of subsidiary companies to be formed not later than two years hence to work the particular areas selected for definite mining operations as wed as a royalty of 5 per cent, on ad metals extracted and customs duty at a flat rate of 10 per cent, ad valorem on ad material and supplies imported. 142. Late in the year Abdur-Rahman Qusaibi obtained a concession of some sort for pearl fishing in the Red Sea. He imported a Syrian overseer and some Venezuelan divers. They made a voyage of discovery, after which it soon became evident that Qusaibi had little hope of pursuing the matter further. 143. There is little else to record under this head. Little was heard of the scheme mentioned in paragraph 133 of the last report for the creation of a textile31 industry at Medina. It appears, however, from an advertisement published early in 1935 that a concern there, presumably the same, is prepared to sell a moderate quantity of cloth. The water from Waziriyya (see paragraph 134 of the last report) continues to flow into Jedda, and has proved a very useful source of supply. No progress seems to have been made with schemes for general supplies of electricity, but an Indian notable undertook to provide plant for the lighting of the sacred precincts at Mecca, and it was to arrive early in 1935. The hotels mentioned in paragraph 136 of the report for 1933 have been maintained. At the end of the year the Banque Misr group were preparing to provide similar, perhaps rather better, accommodation in the building which they had rented in Jedda (see paragraph 95 above). Communications, Roads and Ports. 144. The Saudi Government announced officially on the 15th June that they had cancelled the concession for a railway between Jedda and Mecca (see para graph 132 of the report for 1933) owing to the failure of the concessionaires to fulfil their obligations, after the period for doing so had been more than once prolonged. Other railway projects brighten the dreams of the concession-hunters already mentioned. At present, however, the only scheme which merits attention is that mentioned in paragraph 68 above for reconditioning the Hejaz Railway. 145. Motor transport schemes attracted much attention in 1934. The most important, that for a route from Nejef to Medina, has been dealt with in para graph 13. Much interest was taken in certain other projects, but no attempt can usefully be made as yet to deduce the whole story from the tangle of confused information. The Government seemed anxious to organise a route or routes from the Persian Gulf coasts to the Holy Cities and a postal route to Jauf. Several well-known persons were mentioned at different times as being interested, notably Siddiq, the King’s enterprising chauffeur, M. Van de Poll, the Islamised Dutchman, Mr. Philby and Abdur-Rahman Qusaibi, of the well-known Persian Gulf firm. The Government seem to have made the old mistake of offering too little and wanting too much. In October the Umm-al-Qura announced that a transport company had been formed for the benefit of pilgrims wishing to come overland from the Persian Gulf. This was premature, as no commercial scheme had materialised up to the end of the year. All that happened was that on the 4th December the Saudi Director of Finance in Hasa and the Qusaibis announced jointly in Bahrein that the Saudi authorities would provide transport at stated rates for any number of pilgrims up to fifty. 146. These developments have a special interest in connexion with the efforts of certain firms in India to organise through motor services from that country to the Hejaz. One attempt to provide such a service on a commercial scale was made early in 1934, in defiance of the warnings of the Government of India. It was a fiasco, because, while two of the three cars which started reached Mecca, they were late for the pilgrimage, after the passengers had undergone the utmost hardships. The Government of India renewed their warnings in anticipation of the 1935 pilgrimage, but services were again advertised. Two things are clear. There is nothing impossible in the idea of bringing pilgrims all the way by car, and motor transport will eventually provide a convenient means of combining visits to the holy places in Iraq, and perhaps Palestine, with the visits to Mecca and Medina. On the other hand, no responsible British authority can encourage commercial enterprises of the kind until the promoters have proved their ability to organise them properly, with adequate capital, full knowledge of the routes and the consent of the various Governments concerned. 147. No important developments were reported during the year in connexion with the still very primitive system of roads. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company projected towards the end of the year a short road from Jebel Dhahran to the coast at a spot called Khobar or Al-Akhbar, where a pier was also under construction. 148. No port improvements of any consequence were effected in the Hejaz in 1934. The project of creating a port at Ras Tanura on the Hasa coast continued to languish.32 149. The normal communications of the Hejaz by sea remained very much the same as before, except that rather more ships of the British lines making through voyages called, while German shipping has fallen off and Bussian ships seem to have given up Jedda as a port of call completely for the time being. The appearance of Italian and Japanese shipping in the Persian Gulf affects communications with Saudi Arabia for commercial purposes but indirectly only. It was announced on the 5th May that a native “ Arabian Steam Navigation Company ” had beeh formed and had bought two vessels, which would run between Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports. One of these, a steamer of some 300 tons, bought second-hand at Beirut, arrived on the 21st May and sails under the name of Al Fath or Victory. The other is a similar vessel renamed An-Nasr, which arrived on the 26th June. At the end of the year An-Nasr was laid up in dock at Suez for repairs. 150. As regards shipping specially engaged in the pilgrimage trade, the most important event of the year was the incursion of the Misr Navigation Company in pursuance of the projects conceived by Talaat Pasha Harb and the Banque Misr group in 1933. One ship, the Zemzem, formerly the Bibby Line Gloucestershire and later the British Exhibitor, made three voyages from Egypt. This group also ran towards the end of the year, for purposes ancillary to their main enterprise, two much smaller vessels once or twice, but no regular service was established. 151. Telegraphic and postal services continued to work normally. Wireless continues to be extremely valuable for internal communications. As regards external telegraphic communications, see paragraph 69 above; and as regards the Russian gift of automatic telephone sets, paragraph 88 above. The twenty-five sets presented by the Russians were still installed in fhe King’s Palace at Taif at the end of the year. There is no truth in a report which appeared in the Soviet press in November, that an automatic telephone service had been installed in Jedda. The establishment of a regular fortnightly postal service from Mecca to Riyadh was announced in October. Commerce. 152. As usual, very little information of definite value is available on this subject. The survey foreshadowed in paragraph 141 of the report for 1933 had to be postponed. 153. Some idea of the movement of trade at Jedda, the only port of real importance, may be derived from the following figures, which have been obtained privately and must be received with great reserve :— Arabic year 1351 ending the 25th April, 1933— Imports, £gold 1,214,330. Exports, circa £gold 8,260. Arabic year 1352 ending the 15th April, 1934—^ Imports, £gold 989,080. Exports, circa £gold 8,260. 154. If anything, there was probably a moderate increase in imports in 1934. The war gave an impetus in certain directions. Unusual quantities of rice, for instance, were imported in the first six months of the year. There were also certain importations of arms and ammunition, including 2 million rounds of rifle ammunition, worth about £7,000, supplied by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. to the Government in April, and a consignment of 6,000 rifles and three cases of machine guns from Antwerp in October. The rifles in the latter consignment were old German Mausers, bought through Khalid-al-Qarqani, a well-known member of Ibn Saud’s entourage, of Tripolitan origin. 155. It was announced on the 2nd March that the Government had authorised the creation of an “ Arabian Company for Exports,” with a capital of £5,000 gold in £5 shares. The published list of subscribers included a number of high official personages headed by the Amir Feisal and his little boy, but the total of shares subscribed was, according to three lists, only 298 up to the33 24th March. The manager was a high official of the Ministry of Finance. This gentleman’s father was the slave of a family which formerly had a hide-exporting business, and eventually their chief business man. The son 1ms a finger in many pies, but little has been heard of the new export company since its formation. There is so very little to export. 156. The most interesting commercial event of the year was the conclusion of a new agreement between the Government and Sharqieh (Limited) regarding the importation of motor cars, &amp;c., to replace the agreement described in the report for 1933, which had proved for the most part unworkable. The new agreement was signed on the 1st August. In principle it bore a considerable resemblance to the previous contract, but the conditions accepted by the company were in several respects less onerous and the terms of payment provided were much more favourable to it, as 25 per cent, was to be paid in cash before delivery in the case of cars for the Government, and 50 per cent, cash in respect of those supplied to transport companies. The importation of private cars was left unrestricted, but as the Government and the transport companies are the principal buyers, the monopoly in favour of Ford vehicles, except for certain special requirements, has had a considerable adverse effect on the outside importing market. Ford lorries were coming in right merrily at the end of the year. 157. References to the trade from various countries will be found in the earlier section of the report dealing with foreign relations. V.—Military and Naval Organisation. 158. The Saudi-Yemen war showed how completely Ibn Saud is still dependent on tribal levies and the so-called townsmen (see paragraph 145 of the last report) for use in war. Even the Ikhwan, who must be regarded merely as a modified form of tribal forces, were little heard of as such, whether because their organisation has tended to lose its intended character of tribesmen settled on the land, or because it was not wished to strike the religious note implied in the use of their name. It is not possible to estimate the number of men at the front during the war, but it was perhaps something in the neighbourhood of 35,000. 159. The Minister of Finance was in September given the additional, and apparently newly created, post of Deputy Minister of Defence. As Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman was already the principal official concerned in all questions of supplies, &amp;c., this made little effective change, but it coincided with some attempt to pursue the scheme for a regular army. That army still plays no important role, although there are certain forces in Mecca, a few in Jedda and perhaps a few elsewhere. In November, however, two announcements were made. The first stated that a military school for cadets would be opened at Mecca in January and invited applications from Saudi subjects between 18 and 22 years of age to undergo a three years’ course, after which they might hope to pass out with the rank of second lieutenant. The other announcement invited applications from young men of the same age prepared to serve as soldiers for not less than three years. These were promised food and, with unintended irony, pay “ just as other Government officials.” A Syrian ex-officer, Murad Bey A1 Ikhtiyar, who had recently come to the country, was selected for the post of head of the military school. 160. No great addition appears to have been made to the armament of the Saudi forces, but mention is made in paragraph 154 above of two known cases of the importation of arms, &amp;c., from abroad. It has already been noted that a proposed deal with Poland for the supply of further arms, &amp;c., did not come off. Increased use was made of motor lorries for military transport. They played an important part in the organisation of the forces employed in the Saudi-Yemen war. 161. No increase was made in the modest naval forces of the Saudi Govern ment, but the craft mentioned in paragraph 147 of the report for 1933 proved extremely useful during the war and plied frequently between Jedda and the southern ports. The two small steamers mentioned in paragraph 149 of this report may be regarded as ancillary to “the fleet ” as, while they are owned by a technically private company, they have been and would always be available for Government purposes.34 n &amp; V VI.— Aviation and Connected Matters. Air Force. 162. The Saudi aircraft remained in the disused condition described in the last report for the first five months of the year. On the 3rd June, however, two “ White ” Russians, apparently a pilot and a mechanic, who had served in the Hejaz in King Hussein’s time and whom the Saudi Government had engaged iii^^ Egypt, arrived in Jedda. They got to work quickly and found that three of the Wapitis bought under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government—the fourth had been ruined in the crash recorded in paragraph 164 of the report for 1931—needed only tyres and spare parts to be made workable. They took the air on the 2nd July and stuck to their job in spite of a bungled landing at Taif on the 5th July, which did serious damage to one of the machines. Two further “ White ” Russians, who came from Marseilles, and the wife of one of the first two arrived in Jedda in November. The whole party was still there at the end of the year, but kept very much to themselves. 163. Short flights were pretty frequent during the latter part of the year and there were occasional flights between Jedda and Taif. Mention has been made in paragraph 116 above of a longer outing, apparently connected with the situation in the north. The machine which made that flight is stated to have reached Wejh and Tebuk. 164. At the end of the year two Wapitis were definitely usable. It was not certain whether the machine which crashed at Taif in July had ever been repaired sufficiently to take the air again. The machine which crashed in 1931 and the older aircraft inherited from the Hashimite regime may be written off as completely useless. 165. The transfer of the air force from Jedda to a new base at Taif was foreshadowed in an announcement in the Umm-al-Qura in July and seemed likely to be effected in due course, although no definite action had been taken up to the end of the year. The Minister of Finance, now also Deputy Minister of Defence, displayed a good deal of interest in the whole subject of aerial development in the latter part of the year and in the possibility of establishing an air service between Mecca and Riyadh. A representative of Misr Airwork, who accom panied Talaat Pasha Harb’s party (see below) in November, attempted to interest the Government in the products of that firm. The Minister of Finance was thought to be considering also an American type of mass-produced aeroplane. Other Aviation. 166. Talaat Pasha Harb, who had flown from Egypt on the occasion of his first visit in December 1933, flew again with his party in two aeroplanes in November 1934; as already stated, he was apparently refused permission to go by air to Riyadh, and he had to go by car from Yanbu to visit Medina on the homeward journey. These and other indications show the caution of Ibn Saud as regards flights by foreigners in the interior, but the two air voyages of Talaat Pasha have familiarised at least some people in the Hejaz with the idea of civil flying. The Pasha may yet realise his dream of an air service for pilgrims. Such an innovation, revolutionary as it seems, would be no more contrary to religious principles than the many inventions the use of which Ibn Saud has generalised in the face of opposition from Wahabi extremists. Landing Grounds on the Hasa Coast. 167. No progress was made in 1934 towards an agreement with the Saudi Government on this subject. As stated in paragraph 71, the matter was mentioned tentatively in the September conversations with Fuad Bey in London. Otherwise it remained in abeyance. Such incidents as occurred in the absence of any understanding are mentioned in the following paragraph. Alleged Violations of Saudi Territory. 168. The policy of spontaneously admitting and apologising for unavoidable violations of Saudi territory by British aircraft continued to be pursued with success during the year. It was followed in one case of accidentalflying over the Transjordan frontier in February, and in two cases of forced landing by lloyal Air Force aircraft on the Hasa Coast in April and June. In October it was feared that the search for three Indian Moths which went astray in Iraq might entail the entry of a search party into Saudi territory. This did not prove necessary, but the Saudi Government, on being forewarned, showed *^*great eagerness to help, and the episode ended with a perfect deluge of British gratitude. A third case of forced landing by three Royal Air Force machines at Jinnah Island on the 26th October led to a less happy result. For some unknown reason it was not notified to the British Legation until the 15th November. The belated apology then addressed to the Saudi Government was met by a curt intimation that the King would discuss the matter through Fuad Bey Hamza on his return with a view to a final settlement regarding such matters. This illustrates the danger to which attention was drawn in paragraph 151 of the report for 1933 and the importance of playing the British game of prompt confession and apology according to the strict rules. 169. The most important incident, however, was of a different kind. On the 2nd October the Saudi Government complained officially of the presence of two Royal Air Force machines (and an armed ground party) at a place called Thaniyya Taraif about a week earlier. This was not denied, but the particular spot visited lies on a track which runs through the marginal area at the sounthern end of the Transjordan-Nejd frontier and which has been frequented by British and Transjordan forces for some years without remonstrances from the Saudi side. The complaint was disconcerting, as it had not been thought that the Saudi authorities were at all alert along this portion of the frontier, and the complaint arrived just when arrangements were being made for the further survey mentioned in paragraph 67. After careful consideration, the Saudi Government were informed that their complaint appeared to refer to the presence of an armoured car and two aircraft at “ Shaib Thaniyya Taraif” on the 23rd September in the course of a regular patrol. It was pointed out that patrols had been carried out on the track on which the place lay for the previous three years, and it was claimed that this track was in Transjordan territory. There is some obscurity as to the place names in this area, but the Saudi Government did not return to the charge up to the end of the year. VII.— Legislation. 170. Despite the slight improvement noted in paragraph 153 of the last report, Saudi legislation continues to be very haphazard in form and difficult to keep track of. As regards its substance, there is sometimes a tendency to produce regulations of an impressive type, to which exception can seldom be taken, but which take no account of the primitive character of the political and social structure of the country and its lack of equipment. Considerations of that kind do not stay the happy pens of the modernists, especially some of the imported Syrians, whom an indulgent King allows to play with their toys. There was greater activity in the legislative field in 1934 than in 1933. Apart from certain fiscal measures, mentioned in paragraph 129, and decrees covering concessions, &amp;c., referred to in various parts of the report, the most important enactments may be classed under the following heads :— 171. Nationality .—No new regulations directly dealing with nationality as such were promulgated, but “ Communique No. 13 ” published on the 13th July altered materially the effect of the article in the amended regulations of 1931 providing that persons resident in the country at the date of the original regulations of 1926 should be deemed Saudi unless their foreign nationality were proved by official documents. The communique required persons claiming foreign nationality to produce their proof not later than the 5th February, 1935, and, while the text was not explicit as to the categories of persons aimed at or the consequences of default, it was pretty clear that the intention was to impose Saudi nationality on residents of long standing unless they produced proof of their foreign status by the date named. This looks reasonable enough on the face of it, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom saw no reason to object to the communique in principle, subject to reservations which weremm 36 conveyed unofficially to the Saudi Government. These were an expression of doubt as to whether the time allowed would prove sufficient, and a caveat to the effect that, though His Majesty’s Government would not claim to protect defaulters in Saudi Arabia, such persons would not lose their British status by the mere fact of their having acquired Saudi nationality as well under the local law. The further developments can best be reserved for the next report. 172. Trades and Professions. —A few regulations of different kinds dealt with persons engaged in these, notably tailors and chauffeurs. They need not be described in detail, their chief interest from the foreign point of view being the indications they afford of the Saudi Government’s preoccupation with the question of nationality. Their basic idea appears to be to reserve employment as far as possible for Saudi subjects and to put pressure on foreigners who cannot easily be replaced by Saudi subjects by origin, to accept Saudi nationality. There were, however, two signs of moderation. Foreign tailors already in the business were exempted by an afterthought from compliance with a regulation requiring all tailors to be Saudi subjects, and it was announced on the 31st August that foreign Moslems might be chauffeurs, subject to their agreeing to comply with any orders of the Government, should the latter need their services. 173. Public Health .—A series of regulations dealt with the training of midwives, trade in narcotics, the application as a matter of domestic legislation, subject to numerous reservations, of the International Sanitary Convention of 1926 and precautionary measures against infectious diseases. The very elaborate regulations on narcotics were apparently inspired by international agreements, to one of which the Saudi Government is a signatory though they have not ratified it, and probably the legislation of certain other countries. 174. Real Property. —Important regulations, the publication of which was completed on the 26th October, reaffirmed the old principle that foreigners may not hold real property in the Hejaz, as distinct from the rest of Saudi Arabia, and provided for the liquidation of foreign ownership in the cases where former Ottoman subjects had become aliens vis-a-vis Saudi Arabia or where foreigners might inherit property. This regulation caused a good deal of agitation, but the developments to which it gave rise belong to the year 1935. 175. Coastguard Administration. —A very lengthy regulation, the publica tion of which was completed on the 24th August, dealt with a variety of subjects like the policing and marking of ports, the control of ships and lighters, harbour dues, preventive work on sea and land, pilotage, &amp;c. All these matters were to be dealt with by a central “ Coastguard Administration.” 176. Pilgrim Ships .—It is not yet possible to gauge the effective importance of a short regulation sanctioned on the 22nd December but not published until January 1935, requiring shipping companies to notify the authorities of the names, &amp;c., of ships bringing pilgrims to the Hejaz, the number of pilgrims carried and the arrangements for their return. It provided for the creation of a temporary committee before each Haj to arrange for the return of pilgrims on the principle of first come, first served. VIII.— Press. 177. The Umm-al-Qura and Saut-al-Hejaz, both weeklies, continued to be the only ordinary newspapers appearing anywhere in Saudi Arabia. There are said to be one or two other periodicals published in Mecca, but of a purely religious nature. 178. The Saudi-Yemen war attracted a small number of foreign journalists to Jedda but, with the possible exception of one Egyptian, they were persons of little consequence. They arrived a bit late for the war in a place where there was little to learn at any time. It is not certain that the Egyptian and one of the Europeans who went to Taif by special permission learnt very much more. 179. Except that the war and the Treaty of Taif temporarily attracted rather more attention than usual to Saudi Arabia, especially in the press of the37 Arab countries and Egypt, her position of comparative isolation, so far as world interest is concerned, remained very much as before. IX. —Education. 180. There is little to add to what was said at some length in last year’s report on this subject. The opening of a new private school at Mecca was reported in the press in February. In that month also it was said that one of Ibn Baud’s pilgrimage propagandists in India, a rascal named Jamal Pasha Ghazzi, was trying to enlist support there for a proposal to establish a university in Mecca rather than, as proposed by the Grand Mufti of Palestine, in Jerusalem. Jamal Pasha is, however, an irresponsible man and nothing more has been heard of the idea. In November a party of Javanese and Malayan students with two teachers abandoned the important Soultiyya school in Mecca (paragraph 161 of the report for 1933), apparently owing to a difference with the principal over his disapproval of football. This led, but not until early in 1935, to their opening a new school of their own. 181. It is not generally known that the post of Director of Education is still held by the Saudi Minister in London. His Deputy, another Egyptian named Ibrahim Shura, does not seem to count for much and in August there was a talk of the possibility of his being replaced. X.— The Pilgrimage. 182. This section must be again greatly curtailed. Those who are interested in the subjects will find full particulars in the usual separate report on the 1934 pilgrimage, which was submitted to the Foreign Office on the 11th August. 183. The estimated total number of pilgrims who arrived at Jedda and Yanbu from overseas showed an appreciable increase on the figure for the previous year as will appear from the following table :— 1933. 1934. British and British administered— Indian 7,093 7,396 Malayan 101 173 West African... 509 891 Sudanese 420 534 Palestinian 240 385 Dutch East Indies... 2,316 2,827 Egyptian Others, including minor British 1,698 4,302 elements 8,328 8,744 20,705 25,252 184. The most important elements in the miscellaneous figure for 1934 were 2,138 North Africans, 1,700 Afghans, 828 Bokharans and 972 Persians. The figure includes 500 Hejazis. To get a true view of the foreign pilgrimage, it is necessary to subtract these, but a substantial addition has to be made in respect of the largish number of West Africans who again crossed by dhow from Massawa to southern ports and a good many pilgrims who arrived by overland routes, the increased use of which is likely to have an important effect (cf. paragraphs 13 and 145 above). 185. Pilgrimage Day fell on Sunday, the 25th March. The Legation estimated the number of those present at not more than 50,000, but the Saudi Government put it at about 60,000. One reason why, despite an increased overseas pilgrimage, the total was no greater was the almost complete absence of overland pilgrims from the Yemen, whose numbers are sometimes very considerable. The general conditions in which the pilgrimage was accomplished and liquidated were at least as favourable as in 1933 and call for no special comment in this report.38 XI. —Slavery and the Slave Trade. 186. Developments in 1934 in connexion with the general questions arising under this head were mainly a matter of Anglo-Saudi relations, and have therefore been briefly described in paragraph 66 above. The preliminary consideration of the subject was facilitated by the completion of the special report foreshadowed in paragraph 167 of the annual report for 1933. This important paper, the work of Mr. G. W. Furlonge, reviews the position in regard to slavery in Saudi Arabia in all its aspects. It was submitted to the Foreign Office on the 15th May. 187. The following table shows the turnover of slaves dealt with under the right of manumission exercised by the British Legation in Jedda :— On hand at the beginning of January : 1 male. Took refuge during the year : 15 males, 12 females, 5 children. Manumitted and repatriated : 11 males, 4 females, 3 children. Locally manumitted : 1 male, 5 females, 1 child. Disposed of under special arrangements (see below) : 2 males, 1 female, 1 child. Left the Legation voluntarily after taking refuge : 2 males, 1 female. On hand at the end of December : 1 female. 188. An unusual number of these cases presented special difficulty, which might have been aggravated but for the excellence of the relations which in the main prevailed between the Legation and the Saudi Government and the action of two slaves in leaving voluntarily, one being a woman who had fled from the Amir Feisal’s household, the other a man whom his late owner claimed most uncon vincingly as a son of the house, with the support of the local authorities. The other special cases were as follows :— {a) A slave, unmistakably belonging to the King’s personal guard, took refuge on the 11th April. This threatened to reopen the whole question about Koyal slaves (see paragraph 59 ff of the annual report for 1932), but the King had at the time every reason not to embark on a quarrel with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. It was arranged that the man should be returned to the King, without prejudice to any principles, on the understanding that he would be freed by His Majesty after a short interval, treated well in the interval, and held at the disposal of the Legation for repatriation. Ihese undertakings were duly carried out and the man was embarked on the 17th May. (b) The local authorities very strongly supported the contention of a minor shereef of low character that a married couple, who took refuge with their child on the 29th March, were not slaves but freeborn, and that the woman,who accused him of having used her as a concubine, was, in fact, his own daughter. He, indeed, maintained at the outset that the man also was his nephew, but this was sustained less vigorously. There was some danger of exciting religious feeling if the Legation insisted on sending out of the country a woman alleged to be descended from the Prophet. It was eventually arranged that the owner should legally certify the couple to be free and lawfully married, and that they should be looked after in Jedda by a respectable local family, who had an indirect interest in the case. (c) Later in the year a woman took refuge who was undoubtedly the slave of another shereef, but who was enceinte by the son of her owner. This case also required delicate handling, as the shereef was very insistent on getting the child, which was not expected for six months. The woman herself did not desire repatriation, but professed great fear for her safety if she returned, even as a freed woman, to the shereef’s house. To obviate the necessity for further reference to the case in next year s report, it may be said that it was disposed of in February 1935 by a special arrangement with the shereef. He agreed to give the woman local manumission, and to have her housed pending confinement with a relative, who agreed to receive her and to allow the Indian medical officer to visit her regularly.39 XII.— Naval Matters. 189. The presence of British, Italian and French ships oh the Yemen coast during the Saudi occupation has been mentioned earlier. Those adventures interfered somewhat with the usual routine of British naval visits to *Jedda, which was, however, visited as follows by the two Bed Sea sloops : Hastings, from the 10th to the 14th January; Penzance, from the 22nd to the 29th March; Hastings, from the 2nd to the 6th August. The second of these was the visit normally paid at pilgrimage time, and Penzance once again helped with the traditional regatta for pilgrim ships, which was held on the 26th March. 190. The following visits were paid by French warships : Despatch-boat Ypres, from the 23rd to the 27th March; cruiser Amiral Charnel, from the 19th to the 21st May; despatch-boat Vimy, from the 13th to the 15th December. There were no Italian or other foreign naval visits. 191. It has been more convenient to deal with Saudi naval organisation, such as it is, in section V above; see paragraph 161. 192. Nothing further was heard of the Saudi idea of making regulations regarding visits by foreign warships. The only important questions of principle which arose had to do with the Saudi occupation of the Yemen littoral, and were as follows :— (a) When H.M.S. Penzance arrived at Medi on the 28th April there had not been time to forewarn the Saudi Government. The Amir Feisal protested against the visit. A conversation between Fuad Bey Hamza and Sir Andrew Ryan cleared the air. Subsequent visits to Hodeida passed unchallenged. When things had settled down, His Majesty’s Government ruled that it was not the normal practice to draw any distinction as regards procedure between occupied and national ports. After this visits to Hodeida were, when possible, notified beforehand to the Saudi Government, care being taken to emphasise the fact that this was done on grounds of occupation. The Saudi Government had, on their side, tumbled to the political advantage of not objecting to visits, and no difficulty arose at any time after the first incident at Medi, in connexion either with unnotified or notified visits. (5) His Majesty’s ships at Hodeida transmitted a small number of telegrams both ways between the Saudi Government and the Amir Feisal during the first days of the occupation of Hodeida. This was done at the instance of His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, and on his responsibility. It was laid down in due course that such telegrams could not properly be transmitted unless they concerned only the interests of British subjects. By this time the Saudi Government had made their own wireless arrangements. 193. Arising out of correspondence regarding the participation of His Majesty’s ships in the celebration of foreign national anniversaries, the Admiralty expressed in July concurrence in certain proposals which Sir Andrew Ryan had made in consultation with the commanding officer of H.M.S. Penzance in March. The details are not of sufficient importance or general interest to be given in this report. XIII.— Miscellaneous Matters of British Interest. General Position of British Subjects and their Treatment. 194. Little need be added to what was said in paragraphs 177 to 179 of the report for 1933. European British subjects continued to be treated with every consideration. There was little reason to complain of the treatment of individual British subjects and protected persons of the Moslem faith, although many were likely to be affected by the itch of the Saudi Government either to get rid of or to assimilate foreign Moslem elements. 1 his subject is dealt with, in so far as it turns on legal considerations, in paragraph 171 above. The harshness of the Government towards African negroes, the majority of whom are British or British protected, was a conspicuous exception to the general statement in the last40 sentence but one. These Takrunis, as they are called, could formerly earn their livelihood in this country for periods of varying length, often several years, after achieving their primary object of making the pilgrimage. They are industrious and frugal and were greatly in demand for certain forms of labour. Economic depression, combined with the laxity of the Italian authorities in allowing them to cross by dhow from Massawa, has tended to produce a surplus of unemployed irj^: Mecca and Jedda. The position in Jedda was aggravated, though not as greatly in the long run a^s was feared at the time, by a fire which destroyed a great part of the African village outside the Mecca Gate in Jedda early in April. In May the Saudi authorities forced very large numbers of Africans to leave Mecca for Jedda. The Legation was confronted with the problem of dealing with anything up to 1,500 destitutes, or even more. Arrangements were eventually made with the Government of Nigeria and other authorities for the gradual repatriation of about 1,500, mostly by way of Massawa, and good progress had been made with this task by the end of the year. Social Life and Amenities, Facilities for Travel, &amp;c. 195. The last couple of years have witnessed an intensification of social life in the small non-Moslem foreign community in Jedda, which is sufficiently remarkable to place on permanent record. Their standard of living, if still moderate, has greatly improved, thanks partly to their desire for better surroundings and the beneficent effects of electricity. Although their resources out of doors are still restricted, they can at least get afield more easily in an increased number of cars, and the nine-hole golf course a few miles from the town was greatly improved in 1934. Non-Moslems are still not allowed to travel in the interior, but there are signs of a possible relaxation of the restriction, if at present only in the case of persons whose journeys are for the benefit of the Government, like the Russians who have been to Taif, Dr. Nomland, the geoloo-ist of the Standard Oil Company of California, and Mr. Twitchell, the gold hunter. The same tendency was manifested in the greater readiness shown in 1934 to allow foreign representatives to go to Taif, although the only non-Moslem among them was Sir Andrew Ryan, who went there by invitation in July (see paragraph 59). Al Fadhl {Alfazal) Case. 196. This affair, which has been mentioned in successive reports since 1931 drifted on most unsatisfactorily throughout 1934, another commission having apparently been appointed some time after the first had reported. European Cemetery in Jedda. 197. Following on a meeting of the committee on the 7th April, the wall of the cemetery was consolidated and the caretaker’s house practically rebuilt in the summer of 1934. The experiment of planting two rows of Atriplex Hortensis and a few selected palms had already been begun with satisfactory results. It was arranged at the meeting on the 7th April to convert a credit balance held on the 31st December, 1933, into a special fund for major repairs, &amp;c., and to collect regular annual subscriptions to cover ordinary expenditure in 1934 and subsequent years with a magin for the creation of a small reserve. The projected historical record was completed by the end of the year. Bibliography and Cartography. ~ , f^ e books promised by Captain F. H. C. Armstrong and Lady Evelyn Cobbold duly appeared in 1934. The first, dealing with Ibn Saud under the title Lord of Arabia, had not the success of the author’s Grey Wolf, but it was welcomed by the King’s admirers as a work which, if not always accurate, would make Mis Majesty known, and favourably known in circles to which more serious history might not appeal. Lady Evelyn’s book Pilgrimage to Mecca is of very little value, but is better written than might have been expected, thanks, it is said | to the collaboration of a distinguished literary personage. Major N. E. Bray published a woik on the Arab revolt, which the compiler of this report has not / yet seen. Other publications of Saudi Arabian interest include a French work Ibn Seoud, Roi de VArabic, by Antoine Zischka, with a preface by General Bremond, and an Arabic translation of Mr. K. Williams’s Ibn Saud, and an Arabic book, Bin Saud, by Mustafa-al-Hifnawi.41 199. The mapping of Arabia still leaves almost everything to be desired. The War Office produced in 1934 two further sheets of Philby’s Routes in Arabia, twelve sheets of which had been prepared from Mr. Philby’s data in 1933. This map, though no more than a collection of sketches, covers a wide area between parallels 28° north and 36° north and, being the result of surveys on the ground -i^by a competent adviser, should be a valuable contribution to the effort which, it is hoped, will some day be made to improve on the existing general maps of Arabia. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company have also made since 1933 a notable addition to the cartography of Arabia by producing two sections of a 1 / 500,000 map of the north-eastern area. It does not give the results of their own surveys, but is a useful compilation on an adequate scale from information previously available only in a scattered form. Ornithology. 200. An elderly but enthusiastic ornithologist named Bates, who is an American by origin but lives in England and works under the auspices of the British Museum, arrived in Jedda in January and stayed until late in April. Collaborating with Mr. Philby, he made an extensive study of bird life in the neighbourhood of Jedda and collected some 300 specimens representing about 120 species, several rare and one which is said to be a previously unknown species of Red-legged Partridge. Mr. Philby has to some extent continued this w T ork in a field which seems to have been previously little explored on scientific lines. Appendix. Summary of an Account of the Administrative System of Saudi Arabia given in Fuad Bey Hamza's Book, The Heart of the Arabian Peninsula (Mecca, 1933), p. 63 ff. The writer explains that while he was preparing his book the unification of Ibn Baud’s dominions was proclaimed in September 1932. As this was to be followed by a new Constitution for the whole kingdom and the consequent creation of a new administrative organisation adapted thereto, he abandoned his intention of dealing fully with the subject of administration in a separate section and confined himself to adding an account of the existing system to the geographical section of his work. He refers to the position as between the Hejaz on the one hand, and Nejd and its Dependencies on the other, after the Saudi conquest of the former, and describes the legal situation, before the date of the unification, as having been that they were kingdoms independent of each other, having no connexion but that of a common throne and having each its own Administration. In practice, however, the connexion was much closer. There were no customs barriers or defined geographical boundaries. Their foreign policy was one and directed by one person in the name of both, not on behalf of each' separately. Despite the lack of any legal definition of the measure of connexion or separation, they were closely related in such matters as defence, communications, posts, telegraphs and jurisdiction. As regards administrative organisation and Government regulations, each of the kingdoms had its own system. The Hejaz was, perhaps, closer to Western ways than Nejd and its Dependencies, which had its peculiar arrangements adapted to the nature of the territory, the temper of its inhabitants and their conditions of life. The writer proceeds to give an account of the position in regard to each before the unification. Nejd and its Dependencies. The King was the source of all authority and decided all matters in the final resort. There was nothing to condition his absolute authority except the Sharia, i.e., the sacred law. He had no body of Ministers to assist him. His diwanV *1! 42 (secretariat) consisted of permanent officials to deal with business and submit it for his orders. Matters turning on the Sharia were referred to the judicature. Administrative, political, financial and military matters were passed upon by the King. There were no persons responsible for such matters. Provincial administration was in the hands of Amirs appointed by the Kiner and deriving their authority from him as regards administrative, military an|^r financial affairs, and from the Sharia as regards matters concerning it. There was no special regulation defining administrative areas or the functions, &amp;c., of the Amirs. Such matters were governed by traditional arrangements and existing custom. Administrative divisions may be regarded as resting on the old basis of division into four parts as follows :— &gt; (1) The Amirate of Nejd or Aridh, with its seat of Government at Riyadh, which is also the capital of Nejd. (2) The Amirate of Qasim. (3) The Amirate of Jebel Shammar. (4) The Amirate of Hasa. (5) The Amirate of Asir-as-Surat. Each of these comprised many smaller areas, all called Amirates also, without discrimination as regards size, importance, &amp;c. The writer would regard every area that produced a Bayraq or standard in time of war as an Amirate, including a large number of towns and villages. Fuad Bey goes on to give a detailed list of minor Amirates in Aridh with their principal towns and villages, and adds as a tenth heading “ Bedouin Amirates,” directly connected with that province and containing in their area many of the recently created settlements. He distinguishes four such Bedouin Amirates, giving the tribal names as (i) Subai and Suhul, (ii) Atayba, (iii) Qahtan of Nejd and (iv) Mutair. In describing the Amirate of Qasim, Fuad Bey emphasises the separate character of the administration of Anaiza, despite its geographical position. He enumerates three other Amirates, viz. : (i) Qasim, with its centre at Buraida and numerous villages along the Wadi Rumma (Rima); (ii) Russ, with three villages; and (iii) Mezneb, with three villages. Fuad Bey divides the Jebel Shammar into the three Amirates of Hail, Teima and Khaybar, and a group of Bedouin Amirates of the (i) Harb, (ii) Aneza and Huteim, (iii) Shammar, and (iv) the Amirate of Artawiyya, “ if not attached to Aridh.” He notes that the Wadi Sirhan was formerly under the administration of the Jebel Shammar, but has for some years been attached to the Hejaz for purposes of administration and finance. He divides Hasa into the three Amirates of Hasa, with over fifty villages, including Hofuf and its port Uqair; Qatif, also comprising many villages and three islands; Jubeyl; and a group of Bedouin Amirates, viz.; (i) Murra, (ii) Beni Hajer, (iii) Beni Khalid, (iv) Ajman, (v) Mutair-as-Sufliyyin in Qariya, (vi) Manasir, and (vii) Awazim and Rashaida. He divides Asir into five Amirates with villages namely, Abha, Shahran, Qahtan, Rijal-al-Ma and Najran, and treats separately as a dependency of Nejd the former Idrisi territory, consisting of the three Amirates of Sabia, Jizan and Abu Arish. Hejaz. Fuad Bey outlines the separate constitutional arrangements provided for the Hejaz in 1926 and the principal subsequent amendments. It is unnecessary to reproduce his account of the Constitution, which has been fully reported on. He enumerates the present elements in the Central Administration as follows (but see paragraph 123 of the present report as regards the Ministry of the Interior) :— Presidency of the Council. Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Ministry of Finance. Ministry of the Interior. Legislative Assembly.43 (/yr&gt; The following Departments are attached to the Ministry of the Interior :— Department of Public Health and First-Aid. Department of Education. Department of Posts, Telegraphs, Telephones and Wireless. /•n Presidency of the Sharia jurisdiction and courts. Department of Military Affairs (Regular and Bedouin). Department of Awqaf and the Holy Harem. Department of Municipalities. Department of Water Matters and Ayn Zubeyda. Department of Quarantine. Department of Coastguards. Department of Public Security. Department of Dependencies. As regards the provincial administration of the Hejaz, Fuad Bey enumerates eighteen Amirates having jurisdiction over towns and Bedouins as follows :— (1) Qariyat-al-Milh, the most important villages in which are Qaf, Ithra Saidi and Manwa. (2) Jauf, formerly under the Jebel Shammar administration, but now under Mecca, as stated above. Comprises the southern part of the Wadi Sirhan and the villages of Jauf, formerly Domat-al-Jandal, and Skaka. (3) Tebuk, comprising that place and the neighbouring Bedouin, viz., the Beni Atiya, Huwaytat and others. (4) A1 Ala, comprising that place and the Huteym and Walad Ali tribes and part of the Harb. (5) Dhaba, comprising the littoral south of the Transjordan frontier, the villages of Muwayla, Khuraybah, Haql and the Tuqeyqat and Huwaytat Tihama tribes. (6) Wejh, with its headquarters at that place and jurisdiction over all the Billi tribes. (7) Umm Lajj between Wejh and Yanbu, in which is comprised some part of Juhaina. (8) Yanbu with jurisdiction over some of Juhaina, part of Ahamda and the towns of Badr and An Nakhl. (9) Medina which has jurisdiction over the greater part of the Harb tribe, the Ahamda and the Dhuwi Abdalla division of the Mutair. (10) Rabigh. (11) Qadhima, between Rabigh and Jedda. (12) Jedda. (13) Mecca, which extends from the limits of the Qadhima Amirate to Jebel Sadiya in the South. (14) Taif. ' (15) Ghamid and Zahran, in which are the towns of Baha and Dhofir.

THE history of Saudi Arabia continues to be the story of Ibn Saud and his efforts to construct a durable Empire out of a mass of heterogeneous elements, some of which are so imperfectly known to Europeans, that we are apt to see only the bright particular star and disregard too much the firmament which is his setting. Some attempt has been made in the introductions to previous reports to show the relationship between the two. All that need be said on the present occasion is that there was no capital change in either the man or the setting during 1933. 2. At the beginning of the year Ibn Saud appeared to have consolidated his position by his success in repressing two internal revolts and sterilising, at least for the time being, the efforts of the enemies outside his gates. It would be hard to say whether he had gained or lost ground by the end of it, but he retained that pre-eminence which he has established in the Arab world by his personality and achievements. The death of King Feisal of Iraq had removed the only single figure which could be compared with him in importance and ambition combined. 3. The strengthening of Ibn Baud’s position in 1932 was unaccompanied by any improvement in the financial condition of his country. How far the King himself is affected by the penury of the Treasury is, however, a constant mystery. There can be no doubt that a large proportion of the revenues of the Hejaz is remitted to Riyadh, but the Royal disbursements are also heavy. Many believe that His Majesty has had a sufficient balance to build up a large reserve. At any rate, his progress in modernity has led him to make one charming discovery, how sharp a line can be drawn between the privy purse of a ruler and the Treasury of a State. Whether Ibn Saud be rich or poor ? the Treasury of Saudi Arabia has gone more and more bankrupt. 4. Nevertheless, the early months of the year were marked by an unfamiliar optimism. It looked, to put it coarsely, as though there were enough mugs in the world interested in Saudi Arabia to save her from her improvident and unfortunate self. Concessions were granted for a State Bank, a railway between Mecca and Jedda and the development of the unknown oil resources of Hasa. These projects had one thing in common, namely, that each was to bring a substantial sum of ready money. They were, therefore, the fairest-seeming of several flowers that bloomed in the spring. But there was only one sample of golden fruit in the autumn, when the Standard Oil Company of California delivered £35,000 gold, the first payment due in respect of the Hasa Oil Concession. The other schemes languished or died, and the overseas pilgrimage had been the smallest since 1925. 5. During this early part of the year Ibn Saud appeared to be striving, in spite of all adverse circumstances, to ensure the future of his regime and dynasty. He was all things to all men; a pillar of the faith, though a little firmer perhaps with his religious extremists, whose extravagant Wahhabism is inconsistent with progress or with permanent popularity in the Moslem world; not unwilling to allow modernists to play about with constitutional forms, so long as they did not impair his absolute authority; anxious to placate hostile feeling among his tribes, though possibly less prepared than he had been in the autumn of 1932 to buy their devotion by largesse; and willing to the point of eagerness to compose differences with neighbouring States. The most significant internal event was the proclamation in May of His Majesty’s eldest surviving son, the Amir Saud, as heir apparent, a measure surrounded by every circumstance that could make the King’s choice appear to be that of a unanimous people and every precaution3 [10178] B 2 to commit the other members of the Royal Family to fealty to the heir. In foreign affairs Ibn Sand, always conscious that, however little in the way of material help he may get from the United Kingdom, her hostility would be his ruin, fell in whole-heartedly with her policy of promoting a treaty settlement between him and the Amir of Transjordan, and the texts were signed in July. About the end of May the King even made an approach to the Sheikh of Koweit, although in the form of a singularly untempting offer, with a view to the adjustment of their economic relations. 6. All the while there was growing in the south a cloud, which in the latter part of the year overshadowed the whole sky. The Imam Yahya had never forgiven the Saudi annexation of Asir, begun in 1926, completed in 1930 and consummated by the elimination of the Idrisi at the end of 1932. In 1933, however, the Imam struck, not at Asir, but in the little-known inland region of Najran. All the Imam’s sons are Swords of Islam, an Islam most repugnant to Wahhabi tenets. Two of these young blades followed up operations among their father’s tribes by pushing across what Ibn Saud claims to be an agreed frontier. Whether from firmness or from fear, the King proceeded to mobilise what are for Arabia considerable forces, but he continued to negotiate with prudent moderation. Despite much talk of a Saudi ultimatum in October and November, the negotiations were still proceeding at the end of the year. Armies, however, lined the frontier on either side. All was set for war, yet a settlement or a compromise seemed at that stage more likely. What was passing in the obscure mind of the Imam no one can say. As for Ibn Saud, he presented the appearance of a man hesitating on the brink of an enterprise that, if undertaken^ would put his fortunes to the supreme test. II.— Foreign Relations. (1) Iraq (A) With States in Arabia. 7. No major incident occurred in 1933 to disturb the correctness which has, on the whole, marked the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq since the conclusion of the treaties of 1931. Any causes of friction were discreetly handled on both sides. After the departure in June 1932 of Dr. Naji-al-Asil, their first and unhappily chosen Charge d’Affaires, the Iraqi Government yielded to Ibn Saud’s insistence that Jedda should be the seat of their Legation. They refrained for some obscure reason up to the end of 1933 from appointing to it a Charge d’Affaires en titre, but the junior whom they left in charge during the first half of 1933 was a capable and debrouillard young man, and a successor of similar status, who arrived in October, seems at least harmless. Oddly enough, the Saudi Government, on their side, showed greater eagerness to normalise the diplomatic intercourse between the two countries. The^had selected in 1931 a certain Rushayd Pasha, a former hanger-on of the Beni Rashid of Hail, to represent them at Bagdad, but he had never proceeded to his post. In May 1933 they appointed this gentleman to be consul in Damascus and appointed a Nejdi, one Ibrahim-bin-Muammar, as Charge d’Affaires and consul-general at Bagdad. This personage had had experience abroad, though not in an official capacity, and had more recently been principal private secretary to Ibn Saud and to his heir apparent. He left for his new post in June. 8. No very serious trouble seems to have occurred on the frontier, although some raiding was reported early in the year. An intrusion of Saudi tax-collectors into Iraq in the neighbourhood of Wadi Arar in February gave rise to a protest by the Iraqi Government, as a result of which the party were withdrawn. Some publicity, designed to show how friendly and reasonable both sides were, was given in the Saudi press to a meeting between frontier authorities about the end of May to settle claims and devise means of collaboration. The Iraqi Commandant in the Southern Desert visited Jauf and conferred with the Saudi Inspector of Bedouin Affairs, Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, as well as with the Governor of Jauf-Skaka. Claims were exchanged and some basis of co-operation would appear to have been agreed upon. Further meetings were projected and are said to have taken place in due course, but no particulars regarding these are known to the Legation in Jedda.9. In this connexion it may be noted that nothing has been heard since 1931 about the completion of the settlement in respect of old claims recorded m paragraph 11 (a) of the report for that year. In the absence of information regarding any further development, it must be assumed that Saudi Arabia still owes Iraq £23,000 under the settlement, but that the latter are not disposed to press actively for payment. 10. Negotiations regarding the proposed motor-route between Iraq and the Hejaz appeared to be progressing favourably early in the year, although the Saudi Government were dilatory over the survey work which the Iraqi Government considered necessary on both sides. It was agreed in principle that the route should run from Najaf via Hail to Medina, and that the Iraqi cars should run as far as the latter place. It was also agreed, not without difficulty, that all controls, sanitary and other, should be established at Jumayma on the frontier, but an irreconciliable difference arose as to whether they should be housed in permanent buildings, as desired by the Iraqi Government, or in tents, as preferred by the Saudis. This apparently small point seems to have arrested the negotiations. It is understood that the Iraqi Government have recently returned to the consideration of the whole subject, which is one specially dear to Nuri Pasha. 11. Iraq continues to harbour a good many refugees from Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud tolerates this with an appearance of good grace, although he makes occasional efforts to attract the refugees back. One of them, Khalid-bin-Hithlayn, of the Ajman tribe, created a flutter in Saudi circles in July, when it was thought that he was preparing a “ Putsch ” into his homeland. He probably would like nothing better in favourable circumstances and, like others, seems to size up the possibilities from time to time. Nothing materialised on this occasion, however, to justify Saudi alarm; nor did the incident affect the outward friendliness of the relations between the two countries and their rulers. 12. Ibn Saud made in June a gesture calculated to increase this friendship by removing the restrictions which had been imposed on the manage ment and disposal of the revenues of properties of the Hashimite family in the Hejaz, except as regards one sherif, definitely associated with the intrigues of Hejazi exiles abroad. This question affected a very large number of persons, including all the sons of the late King Hussein. Its apparently satisfactory solution was a matter of interest to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, more especially as regards the interest of the Amir of Transjordan. They have always been unwilling to concern themselves officially in the matter, but His Majesty’s Minister was authorised to make a personal effort to promote a settlement. The credit of having achieved it, however, belongs to the late acting Iraqi representative in Jedda. 13. The late King Feisal, who had a certain passion for offering mediation, telegraphed to Ibn Saud on the 19th August an expression of readiness to do anything he could to help towards a peaceful settlement between the King and the Imam Yahya. The King’s reply was full of gratitude, good Arab sentiment and noble piety, but it was entirely vague. 14. The death of King Feisal caused little manifest emotion in Saudi circles. All the suitable telegrams of condolence on the late King’s death, and congratulations on the new King’s accession, were duly sent. Ibn Saud cannot but have left, however, some relief at the disappearance of a ruler who, underneath all forms of friendship, remained his most formidable rival in the latent struggle for ascendency in the Arab world. 15. The struggle just mentioned has of late found expression in the quarrels between the promoters of the long projected Arab Congress. The two principal groups early in 1933, as in 1932, were those who respectively favoured the claims of King Feisal and of Ibn Saud, though the two champions, especially the latter, kept discreetly in the background. King Abdul Aziz received an emissary from Palestine at Riyadh at the end of 1932, and he was represented by a henchman of his at the meeting of the Preparatory Committee in February 1933. It would be outside the scope of this report to relate the various vicissitudes which led to the postponement of the congress until the autumn at any rate. Nothing has been heard of it on the Saudi side for nearly a year. Ibn Sand’s true attitude probably has been that he would prefer the congress not to take[10178] b 3 I &amp; IA 5 place, though he would doubtless wish to dominate it if the promoters should bring it off and, above all, to guard against its being dominated by any Hashimite ruler. (2) Transjordan. General Course of Events. 16. The year opened in a certain atmosphere of anxiety lest Ikhwan concentrations in the north of Saudi Arabia should portend an attack on Transjordan. Ibn Sand countered an expression of this apprehension by referring to alarming rumours of activity hostile to himself on the other side. These mares’ nests were swept away by mutual explanations early in January, and the way was cleared for the continuance of the efforts of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to promote a general settlement between the two countries. 17. Before describing how this settlement was brought about, it will be convenient to dispose of a matter which had played a large part in the controversies of 1932. In that year Ibn Saud was greatly perturbed by the activities of the group of Hejazi political exiles, of whom the best known are the members of the ad-Dabbagh family. He believed them to be hand in glove with the Amir Abdullah; and there can be little doubt that certain members of the Amir’s entourage, if not he himself, were implicated in anti-Saudi political conspiracies. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had exerted themselves in many directions to remove causes of complaint. Steps were taken to defeat, whenever possible, the activities of the Dabbaghs and their associates; two persons who had been connected with them were eliminated from the entourage of the Amir Abdullah; and the Amir himself and his cousin, the Amir Shakir, were adjured to refrain from any compromising action. By the 19th March, 1933, it was possible for His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda to follow up earlier communications regarding what had been done in Transjordan and elsewhere by a systematic statement in writing which described the measures taken in regard to (1) the activities of the Dabbagh family and their associates; (2) persons in the employment of the Amir Abdullah; and (3) the Beni Atiya tribe and their leaders. 18. Sir Andrew Ryan’s letter elicited a cordial expression of appreciation, and except for occasional echoes as when Tahir-ad-Dabbagh and another conspirator made their way to India, little further was heard in the way of complaint from the Saudi Government. They were, indeed, no longer greatly disposed to magnify grievances of this kind, having been converted to the policy of a treaty settlement, the history of which can now be summarised. 19. On the 11th January, 1933, Sir Andrew Ryan conveyed to the Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs the definite proposals of His Majesty’s Government regarding the procedure for mutual recognition between Ibn Saud and the Amir, to be followed by negotiations for a bilateral treaty, for the fulfilment of which by the Amir they themselves would be expressly responsible. The Saudi reply, dated the 22nd January, was reasonably satisfactory, although it was not very precise except on the one point that Ibn Saud’s assent to the proposals was based entirely on his reliance on the promised British guarantee. On the loth February, Sir Andrew Ryan proceeded to Jerusalem and Amman to discuss details of the procedure, including the formulae by which mutual recognition was to be effected and the drafts of treaty texts, based on those between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, to be propounded in due course as a basis of discussion. 20. After Sir Andrew Ryan's return to Jedda on the 26th February, only mechanical difficulties delayed the recognition procedure. It was completed on the 1st April, when the High Commissioner for Transjordan communicated to the Chief Minister of Transjordan a certified copy of a note from the Saudi Government to the Legation in Jedda conveying the recognition by Ibn Saud, while the Legation communicated to the Saudi Government a certified copy of a similar note addressed by the Chief Minister of Transjordan to General Wauchope. On the following day the rulers addressed to each other simultaneous telegrams in previously concerted terms. 21. It had been agreed in principle that the treaty negotiations should be begun in Jedda, and that if they could not be completed in a single stage of limited duration they should be resumed in Jerusalem. On the 23rd April6 Colonel Cox, the British Resident at Amman, who, with Sir Andrew Ryan, was to exert the mediating influence of His Majesty’s Government, arrived in Jedda, accompanied by Taufiq Bey Abul-Huda, Chief Secretary to the Government of Transjordan, representing ihe Amir. Captain Glubb, the officer commanding the Desert Patrol of the Arab Legion, was attached to the mission as expert. Ihe Saudi Government received the party with great honour, and they were accommodated, together with Mrs. Cox, as official guests at the Kandara Villa outside the town. 22. When the mission arrived, the Transjordan draft texts had taken definite shape. The Saudi delegates, Fuad Bey Hamza and Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, agreed to accept the drafts as a basis of discussion after Fuad Bey had produced a long statement of his own on matters which might in the view of his Government be considered. These included the question of the frontier and, notably, the attribution of the Aqaba-Maan area, which the British delegates firmly refused to regard as being within the scope of the conference. The negotiations, thus begun on the 24th April, continued intensively, except for one short lull, until the 4th May. The draft extradition treaty gave rise to so much controversy that the attempt to make one was abandoned by mutual consent. A more unexpected difficulty arose over an apparently innocuous article in the draft Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage ” providing that His Majesty’s Government should conduct the diplomatic and consular relations between the parties. This was shelved by an agreement to eliminate the article altogether and to embody the necessary understanding in an exchange of diplomatic notes between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government, providing inter alia that the parties might appoint consular representatives of their own at Jedda and Amman. 23. It looked towards the end as though the settlement might be completed in Jedda. On the 3rd May the Saudi delegates presented every appearance of desiring this, but on the 4th May they drew back and it was agreed to resume the negotiations at Jerusalem later. The Transjordan mission left on the 5th May, having every reason to be pleased with their reception, except that Ibn Saud confined his personal attention to receiving them in audience during a short visit to Jedda on the 3rd May, and much reason to be pleased with the progress made. It was so great that Fuad Bey Hamza and Sir Andrew Ryan had little difficulty in settling most of the outstanding points in conversations after the departure of the mission, so as to ensure the success of the second stage of the conference. When they left for Jerusalem in July, little remained except to give final form to the texts and to draw up an exchange of letters on the determination of tribal nationality for working purposes. It was intended that those letters should record the maximum of agreement possible, and should express reservations regarding tribes and tribesmen on whose attribution it was impossible to agree; but there was still difficulty in regard to certain important tribes like the Beni Atiya, and very great difficulty owing to a most unreasonable Saudi claim to a minor Transjordan tribe, the Sirhan. 24. The conference was resumed in Jerusalem on the 24th July, Fuad Bey being the only Saudi representative, indeed, the whole of the delegation. The principal persons concerned were otherwise the same, except that Colonel Cox, absent on leave, was replaced by Mr. A. L. Kirkbride. The work proceeded rapidly. Fuad Bey gave way sufficiently over the Sirhan to make possible an agreement with reservations. The treaty and the connected documents were signed on the 27th July at a meeting presided over by the High Commissioner, who had formally opened the proceedings at Jerusalem. Next day the Amir Abdullah entertained General Wauchope and the various delegates at a luncheon at Amman, the atmosphere of which was extremely friendly and at the end of which his Highness and Fuad Bey exchanged happily-worded speeches. 25. The following is a list of the documents constituting the settlement, including the two letters at (8) and (9) which were actually exchanged later, in order to ensure Ibn Saud’s assent, but which it was agreed to treat as having been exchanged on the date of the treaty :— Treaty Texts. (1) Treaty of Friendship and “ Bon-Voisinage.” (2) Schedule of rules to be observed by the special officers on the frontier provided for in the treatv. (3) Protocol on Arbitration.[10178] b 4 7 Saudi-Transjordan notes annexed to the treaty :— (4) Transjordan letter on tribal nationality. (5) Saudi letter on tribal nationality. (6) Saudi letter on meetings of special officers. (7) Transjordan letter on meetings of special officers. (8) Transjordan letter on the cancellation of raiding claims up to date. (9) Saudi letter on the cancellation of raiding claims up to date. Anglo-Saudi notes, not for publication, signed at the same time as the treaty :— (10) British note on responsibility for fulfilment of Transjordan obligations. (11) Saudi acknowledgment of (10). (12) British note on crossing of frontier by British officials in Transjordan. (13) Saudi acknowledgment of (12). (14) British note on diplomatic and consular relations between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. (15) Saudi acknowledgment of (14). (16) British note on Ruwalla tribe. (17) Saudi acknowledgment of (16). 26. It would be an excess of optimism to suppose that this settlement makes an end of discord between the parties. It nevertheless makes a very distinct advance and it provides rational means of adjusting differences, given even a moderate spirit of goodwill on both sides. Some difficulty arose over the modalities of ratification, but the necessary instruments were exchanged at Cairo on the 21st December. 27. It had been agreed in principle at an early stage in these transactions that Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah should consolidate their new-found . friendship by a personal meeting as soon as the settlement had been completed. It was further agreed after a good deal of consideration that the meeting should take place on board a British warship. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were at great pains to elaborate a plan whereby the two rulers might be brought together on board H.M.S. Adventure, which was expected to be passing through the Red Sea towards the end of January 1934, when they had been led to suppose that Ibn Saud might be available. When this arrangement was proposed, he was absorbed in the quarrel with the Imam Yahya, and for that and other reasons declined the proposal. At the end of the year it was evident that the various practical difficulties of arranging a meeting in a British ship would be very great and the outlook as to what might eventually be settled was completely uncertain. Tribal Affairs and Raiding. 28. In view of the major developments described above, only a few salient points need be noted under this heading. The tribes whose affairs were most in evidence in 1933 were the Beni Atiya and the Sirhan, and these were in evidence, not so much because of what the tribes themselves did (although the Beni Atiya did their bit of raiding), as because of Ibn Saud’s attitude in regard to them and the resentment it aroused in Transjordan, where it is thought that the King does not quite play the game. 29. Ibn Saud, in fact, plays an Arabian game, older than cricket. He could not be blamed for showing kindness to the Beni Atiya who had been turned back into his territory from Transjordan in 1932, but it wms disconcerting to find that one leader, who had begged successfully to be allowed to stay in Transjordan and then changed his mind, was received as an honoured guest at the King’s Court. Another, who had been kept in confinement in Palestine, lest he should incite his fellow-tribesmen against Ibn Saud, managed to escape, had only to flee into Saudi Arabia to be pardoned. Thus the British authorities in Transjordan incur odium by taking measures in the King’s interest and the King gets the credit of magnanimity towards those who come under his wing. 30. The Beni Atiya are, however, a familiar nuisance. The Transjordan authorities were much more upset over the Sirhan. This tribe, although no longer of great numerical importance, has a long past history, in the course of which they once established themselves in the region of Jauf and Kaf. Settled8 descendants of theirs still live in Saudi Arabia. Ihe nomad poition ave oiig had their being in what is now Transjordan, but they exercise grazing ug s over the border, and some of them are still entitled to a shaie in the pio uce of date gardens at Kaf. For some time the Governor of the latter place had been putting pressure on them by refusing to recognise their rights and o 101 methods, to accept Saudi nationality and in the course of the negotiations a Jedda the Saudi delegates claimed the whole tribe as owing allegiance to 1 &gt;n Saud. As already stated, the question was settled at Jerusalem m July m a manner which, on the whole, gave satisfaction to Transjordan, but there was reason to believe that later in the year the Governor of Kaf, a knavish fellow at the best, was still up to his tricks. 31. The amount of raiding during the year would appear to have been negligible, judging by the records in the Legation of protests by the two Govern ments. No specific raids in the true sense of the word were alleged against the Transjordan tribes. The Saudi Government tried to represent two incidents in the police work of the Arab Legion as acts of brigandage and in December they stated, without giving adequate details, that their subjects had been the victims of several robberies from the 7th August to the 20th October. One raid by Beni Atiya occurred in January, but Captain Glubb rounded up the raiders before they could leave Transjordan. Members of the same tribe were responsible for a series of small raids on Transjordan tribesmen in the second half of the year. The Saudi authorities gave some, though not complete, satisfaction in respect of these. On the whole, the situation in 1933 justified Captain Glubb’s boast that, while so many political storms have raged about it, the Saudi-Transjordan frontier has become the healthiest in all Northern Arabia. 32. Older raids continued to be the subject of desultory correspondence. At the beginning of the year a further meeting was projected between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd, but the latter evaded it in a manner which exposed him to an accusation of discourtesy. In the event the treaty negotiations superseded, for practical purposes, all previous arrangements for dealing with claims, and the eventual settlement provided for a mutual cancella tion of all claims in respect of raids prior to the signature of the treaty. The only important relic of the past now is the claim of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the still unpaid share of the Saudi Government in the expenses of the MacDonnell enquiry of 1930. Lie of the Frontier. 33. The question of the “ graticule ” (see paragraph 32 of the report for 1932) has continued to engage the anxious attention of Departments in London, but did not advance during 1933 to any point requiring action by the Legation. It was decided at an interdepartmental meeting at the Colonial Office on the 6th October, 1933, that no progress could be made without more precise geographical information and that an unostentatious survey should be made in the first instance of the frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. It was not considered advisable to undertake a similar survey of the portion of the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd, where the attention of the Saudi Government would almost certainly be excited. 34. Early in the year the Saudi Government gave a very lame reply to representations regarding the incidents on the last-named portion of the frontier which were mentioned at the end of paragraph 32 of the report for 1932. A rather more serious situation arose in August 1933 owing to the establishment of a Saudi post at Hazim, an important water point, considered by the British and Transjordan authorities to be unquestionably on the Transjordan side of the frontier. This led to diplomatic correspondence, in the course of which the Saudi Government maintained that Hazim was actually on the frontier. The question had not been settled by the end of the year, but the situation on the spot had been eased in the interval by the withdrawal of the Saudi post to a position some 3^ miles from the wells. Status of Aqaba and Maan. 35. Although this question remained in abeyance during the year, there were definite signs of an itch on the part of the Saudi Government to reopen it[10178] B 5 9 in some shape or form. As has been stated above, the Saudi delegates raised it at the outset of the negotiations in Jedda. They reverted to it again at the end of those negotiations, not so much with the idea of insisting that it should be dealt with, as with the object (a) of asserting that, in their view, it was, in fact, germane to the negotiations, and (6) of establishing the position that, if it could not be discussed at a Saudi-Transjordan conference, it could be discussed otherwise, i.e., with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Sir Andrew Ryan was prepared to admit this on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. He had told Fuad Bey in a personal conversation during the conference how useless it would be to ask His Majesty’s Government to reconsider their attitude, but it is obvious that, by the terms of the letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda on which the status quo rests, the Saudi Government are free to reopen the question, whenever they think that “ favourable circumstances will permit a final settlement.” Sir Andrew Ryan’s admission caused, however, anxiety to Taufiq Bey Abul Huda, who feared that it might prejudice the position in the matter of the Amir Abdullah. In deference to this scruple, Sir Andrew Ryan fell back on the position that the matter was so far outside the scope of the conference, that nothing at all should be postulated regarding it. There was some talk of recording the exchange of views in an agreed minute, but, luckily, this was lost sight of. The position therefore remains intact, but it is quite possible that the Saudi Government may return to the charge with His Majesty’s Government in 1934 (see paragraph 72). Customs Relations. 36. The draft note referred to in paragraph 35 (d) of the report for 1932 remained in its pigeon-hole all the year. No dispute arose regarding trans frontier trade, which appears to be carried on as it always has been, regardless of controversies between Governments. The Saudi delegates pressed for a reaffirmation of article 13 of the Hadda Agreement in the new Treaty of Friendship. This was agreed to, subject to explicit oral statements that all that was being done was to maintain the article with its former effects, whatever they might be. Opportunities were taken during the first stage of the conference and later of expressing the readiness of the Transjordan Government to define those effects in a suitable form by an agreement as to how the principle of free transit between Syria and Saudi Arabia should be reconciled with the legitimate rights of the Transjordan Government, notably in regard to the control of certain classes of trade like arms, narcotics, &amp;c. The suggestion was also thrown out unofficially that it might suit both parties to enter into a simple form of customs agreement. The Saudi Government preferred that these matters should be left outside the main treaty settlement. This was agreeable to everyone concerned. It was thought at the same time that advantage might be taken of the presence of Fuad Bey Hamza in Jerusalem in July to explore the issues further. In anticipation of this possibility, His Majesty’s Minister reviewed the whole subject in a despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan, dated the 27th June, 1933. In the event, no opportunity for dealing with the matter presented itself during the short period of the negotiations in Jerusalem, and the matter remained in abeyance during the remainder of the year. (3) Yemen. Course of Events. 37. Ibn Baud and the Imam Yahya preserved the appearance of friendship appropriate to Arab brotherhood and their common faith throughout the revolt in Asir during the last months of 1932. No jarring note was struck until it became apparent about the end of January that Hasan-al-Idrisi and others had taken refuge in the Yemen. Ibn Baud was eager to obtain their surrender and pressed his point so strongly that the Imam apparently conceded it early in February, on a promise by the King of pardon and good treatment for the refugees. Weeks passed and the surrender did not take place, perhaps because the Imam was insincere, perhaps because he could not overcome the opposition of the Idrisi himself. At last it was announced in a Saudi communique of the 14th April that the King had not only consented to Hasan remaining in the Yemen under the supervision of the Imam, who would guarantee his good conduct,10 but also to pay him a pension. The hope was expressed that Seyyid Abdul Wahhab, the nephew of Hasan and a prime mover in the revolt, would return to Saudi Arabia with other refugees to enjoy the benefit of the amnesty. This hope was not realised in the case of any important member of the family save one who returned later in the year. 38. While these negotiations were proceeding, the secretary whom Ibn Saud had sent to Sana (see paragraph 39 of the report for 1932) brought back the ImanT&amp; reply to a letter from Ibn Saud. This reply was published in the Umm-al-Qura on the 17th February in a form which, as appeared later, gave umbrage to the Imam, having been apparently transmitted by wireless, and corruptly, from Abha. It would be useless, even if it were possible, to probe into the exact character of the letters exchanged. All that matters is that they paved the way for the despatch to Sana at the end of May of a Saudi mission composed of Khalid-al-Qarqani, a Tripolitan ex-adversary of the Italians and a comparatively recent recruit to the service of Ibn Saud, Hamad-bin-Suleyman, the brother of the Minister of Finance, and Turki-al-Madhi, who had long played a role in affairs connected with Asir. 39. After a period of procrastination in Sana, the mission reported in July that the Yemeni delegates appointed to meet them had demanded, albeit “ with shame in their faces,” nothing less than the cession to the Imam, as properly belonging to him, of what had been the Idrisi’s territory and the districts of Qantan and Hamazan. The territorial scope of this demand is not easy to determine, but it clearly extended to a considerable part of Asir, both lowland and highland, and it was not such as Ibn Saud could conceivably accept. Insult was added to injury towards the end of the month, if it be true, as the Saudi Government alleged, that the mission had been refused permission to leave Sana. Whatever the true facts of this, the mission actually left on or about the 3rd August. 40. During all this period another storm had been blowing up from the south. I wo of the Imam’s sons had followed up operations among their own tribes by entering Najran, an area further inland than Asir. Little is known of the geography of this region and it will be seen presently how obscure is its history. It is, however, important because of its position on lines of communi cation, and Ibn Saud was greatly outraged by the Imam’s invasion of an area in which his rights had, he held, been recognised both by the local tribesmen, the Beni Yam, and by the Imam. The tribesmen, it may be said, are hardy fighters and differ from their neighbours in belonging largely, if not wholly, to' the Shia sect of Ismailis. 41. The question of Najran had assumed serious proportions by the time the Saudi mission left Sana. They brought away with them a letter from the Imam suggesting that Ibn Saud should recognise his claim to Najran, and that the settlement of other matters should be postponed until later. Ibn Saud refused to entertain this proposal. 42. Thus, the position in August was that the two rulers were at loggerheads over not less than three areas, the former territory of the Idrisi, Najran and, thirdly, a mountainous region between the other two. Ibn Saud was in possession of at least the littoral or T ihamat Asir, to use what is now the Saudi name, and a convenient one, for the former Idrisi territory. The position in the mountainous region is not so easy to determine, but Ibn Saud would appear to have been in some sort of possession there. In Najran, on the other hand, the Imam’s sons were campaigning against the local tribesmen, with fortunes which had varied and were still to vary later. The tribesmen had the sympathy of Ibn Saud, though he was careful not to send his own forces into the area, 43. While the storm was brewing Ibn Saud took His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom increasingly into his confidence. In July he not only sought their advice, but sounded them as to the possibility of material assistance. The answer to the latter suggestion was naturally in the negative. As for advice, they dissuaded the King from taking any hostile initiative, although, to quote a telegram dated the 3rd August, they considered that “if he feared attack in any important place in Asir, there was no reason why he should not place his own foices theie to defend it. I he position of His Majesty ’s Government was[ 10178 ] b 6 11 throughout embarrassing. Ibn Saud continued to bombard them with his grievances. They were all the more reduced to replying with counsels of moderation, as the Italian Government took the situation seriously and, true to their friendship for the Imam, laid all the blame for it on Ibn Baud’s past aggression, as they considered his annexation of Asir to have been. The Italians refused to budge from this attitude, though they were willing to give in their turn counsels of moderation to the Imam. 44. Both the rulers directly concerned were very ready to meet counsels of moderation with declarations of pacific intention and to correspond with each other direct, but they both proceeded to concentrate forces in their frontier areas, so that by the end of August each had made not inconsiderable preparations for a possible war. From that time to the end of the year the exchanges of telegrams continued in spurts and the military preparations more steadily. It is impossible to estimate in Jedda the number or military value of the Imam’s forces at any given time. Ibn Saud, however, put forward what may be regarded as the maximum effort possible. He sent large parties to the front both by land and sea, built up reserves in the Hejaz and in Nejd, and used all his powers of persuasion and intimidation to ensure the support of his tribes, some of whom were reported to have little stomach for distant fighting. One of his nephews, the Amir Feysal-bin-Saad (not Saud) was made Commander-in-chief at Abha in September, and it was suggested that the Heir Apparent might be sent to replace him, if need arose. On the 19th October, the Minister of Finance, who, in the absence of Fuad Bey Hamza, had been acting as intermediary between the King and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, foreshadowed the completion of the Saudi military preparations in about a week, the issue thereupon of an ultimatum to the Imam, and an offensive, through Najran in the first instance, if the ultimatum were rejected. The Saudi Government proceeded to get ready a Green Book, to be published if war should break out. 45. No formal ultimatum was issued. Its place would appear to have been taken by a stiff telegram on the 10th November, in which Ibn Saud once more restated his demands and called upon the Imam to define his attitude. After some delay, the Imam replied agreeing to come into conference, but ignoring the request for a definition of his attitude on the points regarding which the King sought a preliminary understanding. This correspondence nevertheless paved the way for further communications, as a result of which the situation appeared to be taking a more favourable turn. On the 10th December Fuad Bey described it to Mr. Calvert in terms which foreshadowed the possibility of a settlement on two points. On the 28th December, although there had been some sinister rumours in the interval, he defined it on similar lines, but more precisely, to Sir Andrew Ryan. His language was on the whole hopeful, but he intimated that thore would still be a casus belli unless the Imam agreed to the King’s then latest proposal about Najran. 46. The points insisted upon by Ibn Saud were explained in different terms on different occasions, but they seemed to turn throughout on four subjects, namely, (a) measures to put a stop to the anti-Saudi machinations of which the Idrisi was still accused; (b) Najran; (r) the cessation of intrigues by the Imam’s emissaries in certain areas; and (d) a frontier agreement to be recorded in a proper treaty. As regards (a), Ibn Saud was at first inclined to renew his former demand for the surrender of the Idrisi, but in December he was satisfied with a promise that the Idrisi, and apparently his relatives, would be relegated to Zebid, well away from the frontier. As regards (5), Ibn Saud at first simply demanded the evacuation of Najran, but his final proposal in December was that the Imam should evacuate it on the understanding that he himself would not occupy it, and that, if any trouble should occur in what would thus become a sort of neutral buffer area, the two rulers should concert measures. As regards (c), Ibn Saud’s grievance seemed to relate more especially to the country of the Beni Malik and the Abadil, a part of the mountainous area mentioned in paragraph 42 above. It was difficult to make out in 1933 what the exact trouble was, but, in order to get the picture in its true proportions, it is necessary to state here, in anticipation of the next report, that early in 1934 the dispute over the Beni Malik and the Abadil proved to have become a capital factor in the whole quarrel. The Saudi Government accused the Imam of having, in spite of many***’*'• ' v ' 12 fair promises, fomented a revolt of the local tribes or allowed it to be fomented by his subordinates and Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi. It was suggested, but less confidently, that Yemeni troops had entered the area. As regards (d), Ibn Saud’s objective was to commit the Imam to recognition of his position in lihamat Asir and the hinterland. According to Fuad Bey’s statement on the 28th December, the Imam had then expressed readiness to do this and to conclude a treaty for jp* twenty years, a limitation which would not, however, in Fuad Bey’s view, leave the Imam free to reopen the frontier question at the end of that time. The outlook at the end of the year was that, if the Najran difficulty could be surmounted, delegates of both parties would meet to reduce what had been agreed to treaty form. 47. This rapid review necessarily ignores numerous details of a situation which evolved, at times very foggily, over a period of many months. It is necessary to say a few words as to what actually happened in Najran, so far as is known. The Yemeni forces appear to have had a set-back in their first operations in the early summer. Returning to the charge, they advanced and occupied, probably in July, a place called Badr, which would appear to be a centre of religious importance and is said to be situated about 20 miles south-east of the intersection between latitude 18° N. and longitude 44° E. Eventually they were so pressed by the tribes that they evacuated, probably early in November, the Wadi Habuna Valley, and withdrew after having razed Badr to the ground. The geography of the region is so uncertain that it is impossible to say whether this retreat meant a complete evacuation of Najran. All that need be added is that the conflict against the Yemenis was throughout sustained by the local tribesmen themselves, except that at one moment, probably early in December, neighbouring Wahhabis lent them a hand. The facts of the episode are obscure. Fuad Bey, when admitting with some coyness that it had happened, stated that the interveners, though in sympathy with Ibn Baud, were not part of his accredited forces. Historical and Legal Aspects of the Dispute. 48. Something must be added about the legal merits of the dispute, if only because the Italian Government have been disposed to support the Imam, not only on grounds of general policy, but on juridical or quasi-juridical grounds. Any attempt to study the legal issues must necessarily be tentative, as they turn largely on historical considerations, which cannot be fully explored, and on agreements, or alleged agreements, of which there is very little precise knowledge. 49. Here again it is necessary to give separate consideration to each of the three areas mentioned in paragraph 42 above, but before doing so it will be well to dispose of one argument, which has greatly impressed the Italian Government and which, if valid, might affect not only Tihamat Asir, but also the highlands further inland and possibly Najran. It is that Asir is proved to have been part of the Yemen by the fact that in Turkish times it formed part of the Vilayet of the Yemen. There is in this a great confusion of thought. It may be admitted that in old days Asir was geographically part of the Yemen. It is probable that the political control of past Imams extended to it. There is, however, no evidence that when the Turks reasserted themselves in that part of Arabia over sixty years ago the Imam had any such control. It is true that when the Turks constituted the Vilayet of the Yemen in 1872 Asir was included in it as a sanjak. The vilayet was, however, a Turkish administrative unit, not a territory of the Imam. The Turks never effectively occupied the whole area, but they were from that time on internationally recognised as the sovereign Power. Their authority, never perhaps very secure, was eventually challenged very definitely by two distinct rebels with distinct historical pretensions, the Imam in the Yemen proper and the Idrisi in Asir. Each rebellion had to be tackled as a separate political and military proposition. The Turks were so alive to this that in, or soon after, 1909 they made the Asir a separate administrative unit. In 1911 they effected a composition with the Imam, by which he obtained a measure of autonomy. This did not involve the withdrawal of a Turkish Vali, nor did it involve any recognition of the Imam’s authority over Asir, when the Turks were up against the Idrisi. V-U.50. It is unnecessary to go into the difficult history of the years 1911 to 1920. The essential fact is that, when the Ottoman Empire broke up, two distinct sovereignties had emerged, that of the Imam and that of the Idrisi. The limits of their respective territories varied and in 1920 a new factor was introduced by an agreement between the Idrisi and Ibn Baud, which has not been published, but which, to some extent, defined the eastern boundary of the Idrisi s territory. This is the basis of the distinction now made by the Saudi Government between Tihamat Asir or former Idrisi territory and Asir Surat, in which Ibn Baud established his authority by various proceedings, the most important of which was the final elimination of the Beni Aidh, former rulers of Abha, who had regained a precarious independence there after the Turks evacuated it at the end of the war. 51. Ibn Sand’s claim to Tihamat Asir rests mainly on cession by a lawful ruler, the Idrisi, of the territory ruled by the latter in 1926. If it be admitted for the reasons given above that the Idrisi had, in fact, become a lawful ruler, this contention cannot be resisted, although a doubt may exist as to what was the southern boundary of the territory to which the Idrisi could convey a title. Ibn Saud is understood to maintain that this subsidiary question of the frontier between Tihamat Asir and the Yemen was settled in 1931, when he recognised the Imam’s claim to Jebel Arwa (see paragraph 35 of the report for 1931). 52. The nature of the Saudi tenure of Asir Surat is much more difficult to define. It rests partly on historical considerations too old to be taken seriously as they relate to the early and transitory extension of Wahhabism in its first heyday. It rests mainly on Ibn Saud’s absorption of the territory after the war, when, as has been stated above, he superseded the Beni Aidh at Abha and seems to have asserted himself further south with such effect that one of the principal chiefs, Ibn Dhulaym, went as a Saudi delegate to Sana in 1927. Vis-a-vis the Imam, Ibn Saud claims that the delegation of which this Ibn Dhulaym was a member agreed on a division of territory. If this could be proved, it would be the strongest element in Ibn Saud’s case, but nothing that is known of the history of the two Saudi delegations which visited Sana and the Yemeni delegation which visited Mecca in 1927-28 suggests that definite and binding agreements were then reached. All that can be said is that, in the area north-west of Saada, which comprises both the southern end of Asir Surat and the adjoining highlands of Tihamat Asir, Ibn Saud appears to have exerted in recent years a more or less effective authority. It has been challenged by local tribes, notably at the time of the Idrisi rebellion in 1931, but the Imam is not known to have explicitly claimed the area as a whole until 1933 (see paragraph 39 above). 53. The question of Najran is even more obscure in its historical aspects. It seems improbable that either the Beni Saud, the Turks or the Imams have ever occupied it effectively for any long period since the time in the eighteenth century, when a notable preacher in Najran, one A1 Makrami, carried his doctiine and his’sword far afield. His descendants are still apparently the leading family in Najran and it is probable that the only sound title to it is that of the Beni Yam, though they have doubtless bowed to successive storms of conquest. It is not known in Jedda on what grounds, other than historical, the piesent Imam bases his pretensions. As for Ibn Saud, he may be able to cite earlier exclusions into Najran, like that which his troops made early in 1932 (see paragraph 101 of the report for that year). There is some slight indication that before that date his authority was recognised by the tribesmen, e.g., Mr. Philby relates in Volume 2 of his Heart of'Arabia how two parties of them had referred a dispute to the Saudi Governor of Wadi Dawasir. The upshot of the 1932 expedition appears to have been that Ibn Saud agreed not to interfeie in the district so Ion' as the Beni Yam comported themselves as loyal and peaceful subjects. This derives confirmation from a statement in the Umin-al-Qura in May 1932 that certain Najran notables had submitted to Ibn Saud a document given to their forbears by his ancestor, Saud the Great, and that the King had confirmed it. The document could be read either as a pious tract or as a guai antee of non interference For the rest, in this case also, Ibn Saud relies on the agreement alleged to have been reached in 1927-28. A precise account of it is given m a letter written by the first secretary of the Saudi Legation m London to Mr. Rendel on the 28th July, 1933. It stated that on the 31st December, 1927, the Saudi [10178] B 714 delegates at Sana proposed a settlement whereby Najran and the country north should belong to Ibn Saud, while “ Waya and southwards ” should belong to the Imam and the southern frontier “ from inland to the sea ” should remain as it was. Mr. Zada added that at a meeting two days later the Imam’s delegates accepted this, “except where it related to the Idrisi territory.” This quali fication is ambiguous, but, in any case, the Imam is understood to deny that there was ever any agreement, although the Saudi Government assert that he has himself invoked it in the past. (4) States in the South and South-East of Arabia. 54. There have been signs recently of considerable interest on the part of Hadhramis in the Hejaz in the troubles of their country of origin. As this interest did not come actively to the notice of the Legation until 1934, the subject need not be dealt with in this report. It may, however, be mentioned that, according to information from a good source, Ibn Saud was approached during the 1933 pilgrimage by a party of Hadhramis from Java, who begged him to go and restore order in the Hadhramaut. The King is said to have rejected the appeal on the grounds that it was under British protection. 55. Every pilgrimage seems to bring notables from the Trucial Coast to Mecca. The King doubtless maintains some connexions with the sheikhdoms there through such persons and through his cousin, the Governor of Hasa. There is, however, no evidence that he abuses this connexion £pr political purposes or that any significance attaches to the visit to Mecca of even such a personage as the ex-Sultan of Muscat, who arrived in Jedda on tKe 7th December, 1933, intending to stay for the 1934 pilgrimage. 56. One more important episode occurred in the autumn, when the Sheikh of Qatar visited the King at Riyadh. Rumour assigned various reasons for this excursion. It was most generally attributed to some money transaction between the two rulers, but the versions of this story are so various that it is impossible to know whether the sheikh has lent money to the King and cannot get it back or whether the King was trying to get money out of the sheikh in respect of the secret subsidy mentioned in paragraph 45 of the report for 1930. 57- It is possible that there are deeper reasons for the interest which the King and the bheikh of Qatar take in each other. The sheikh, having so far failed to get His Majesty s Government in the Lnited Kingdom to guarantee him protection against aggression on his land frontier, may be anxious to make interest with Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud may wish to direct the sheikh’s oil policy, foi Qatar, like Hasa, has attracted the interest of the oil magnates. Further examination of the whole subject must be reserved for the report for 1934, but it may here be mentioned that the prospect of oil being discovered in these areas has given rise to important questions as to what is the land frontier of Qatar what should be considered to be the limit of Ibn Saud’s territory on the eastern side and whether Qatar and Saudi Arabia should necessarily be regarded as coterminous. &amp; (5) Bahrein. 58. The reasons for which Bahrein and Koweit were dealt with under a single general heading in previous annual reports have lost much of their cogency. The questions connected with their relations with Saudi Arabia have become more and more disconnected with each other. Some of those which presented features of common interest, e.g., the wish of the Saudi Government to secure an official status for Ibn Saud’s agents in the two sheikhdoms, have fallen into abeyance. Where the questions mentioned in earlier reports are still active, the tendency of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom has been to treat each on its merits, e.g., any idea of using Bahrein transit dues as a means of pressure to secure a relaxation of the “ Koweit Blockade ” has been practically abandoned. The group of “ Persian Gulf Questions ” has in fact disintegrated. ’ ’ 59. The only important question affecting the Arabia and Bahrein in 1933 was that of transit dues. relations between Saudi Its previous phases were15 [10178] b 8 summed up in paragraphs 51 to 53 of the report for 1932. The happy develop ment recorded in paragraph 53 (a) of that report appeared to be connected with a not very explicit arrangement recorded in a letter by Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi, the Governor of Hasa, to the Deputy Ruler of Bahrein on the 30th June, 1932. The situation was again, however, envenomed by the incident of the Ahmedi, the ship mentioned in paragraph 53 (/) of the previous report. The drastic action taken by the Bahrein Government in that case appears to have been effective in discouraging ships from attempts to escape the dues by discharging cargo at Bahrein and proceeding, thus lightened, to the Hasa coast with cargo for the mainland. The action was, however, difficult to defend, except by an extreme application of the doctrine of sovereign rights. His Majesty’s Govern ment made it their aim to merge discussion of the incident in a more general discussion having for its object a settlement which should reconcile the divergent interests of the Bahrein and the mainland in the common interest of both. They proposed in May an informal meeting at Bahrein of representatives of the two Governments, with the assistance of the Political Agent, on the understanding that they should endeavour to devise a solution, which, if approved, could be embodied in an exchange of notes between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Government and which might, if necessary, operate for a fixed period. 60. The Saudi Government did not contest the view expressed by His Majesty’s Government, when making this proposal, that the concession made to Ibn Saud in 1920 was, in its nature, unilateral and terminable. They evaded the conference proposal and explained that they were giving effect to Ibn Saud’s long-entertained intention of developing his own ports, by arrangements for ships and cargo to go direct to Ras Tanura. It was difficult, on the information available (see paragraph 140), to determine whether this was bluff or not. Eventually His Majesty’s Government informed the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs in September that the attitude of his Government left Bahrein no option but to denounce the concession of 1920 and that a claim to most-favoured-nation treatment, which the Saudi Government had slipped into their reply to the pro posals made in May, could not be admitted. There was, however, no intention of immediately raising the transit dues and the official note was accompanied by a personal letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggesting that the conference proposal might be revived. An interim reply dated the 9th October ended the correspondence in Jedda, but a week later the Saudi Minister in London approached the Foreign Office in a manner which showed, on the one hand, that Ibn Saud was not so indifferent to the facilities afforded by Bahrein as he wished to appear in May, and, on the other, that he was not so ready as had been hoped to allow the Ahmedi incident to merge in general discussion. This led to a fresh flow of inter-departmental correspondence, which was still proceeding at the end of the year. (6) Koweit and Koweit Neutral Zone. 61. Blood, they say, is thicker than water, and some think that mineral oilli is a bit thicker than either. The first part of this proposition was quoted by the' Political Agent at Koweit at the end of November last to explain why the sheikh and his people, despite all they had suffered at the hands of Ibn Saud, would sympathise with him, if his quarrel with the Imam Yahya involved him in serious difficulties. The people of Koweit are essentially Nejdi and the two rulers are related through a common Aneza tribal origin. Anyhow, the relations between Ibn Saud and the sheikh during 1933 continued to be the bitter-sweet relations of people who seem both to love and hate each other with some foundation of sincerity in both feelings. They at least understand each other better probably than His Majesty’s Government understand either. What part mineral oil plays is still a matter of speculation, but it may prove later to be a factor of union or of discord. 62. In February the sheikh received a confidential emissary from Ibn Saud, who brought letters and, it was thought, oral messages. Much comment was excited a little later by two mysterious journeys a long way into the desert which the sheikh undertook on the 20th-23rd February and on the 25th-27th February. It was believed that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself, and, while there does not appear to be any very definite evidence, Colonel Dickson at a later date considered it pretty well established that he16 had met either the King or his son, the Amir Sand. The I ohtical Agent saw reason to surmise that the talk related to a possible common oil policy 01 to Ibn Sand’s desire for financial assistance. 63. Whatever passed early in the year between the two rulers did not affect the rigour of Ibn Sand’s embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. It was ^^ maintained, under the supervision of Ibn Jiluwi, the Governor of flasa, by a^ s horrid henchman of his named Al-Bagawi. During the early part of the year the principal preoccupation of His Majesty’s Government was to find means of eliminating the complication which had been introduced into the question in 1932, when Ibn Saud’s attitude in regard to the old claims of the Sheikh of Koweit had held up the proposal for a meeting of commissioners (see paragraph 46 (//) of the last report). The sheikh had done much to create this difficulty by the unguarded nature of his correspondence with Ibn Saud early in 1932. After various preliminaries it was decided at the end of April 1933 to put before him three alternatives, namely, (a) that he should himself pursue with the King the question of the interpretation of the letters exchanged between them regarding claims; (b) that he should authorise His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to inform Ibn Saud that he had had no intention in the correspondence of disposing of any but entirely minor claims; (c) that he should abandon the disputed claims in order to remove the obstacle they constituted to a settlement of the blockade question. It was further decided that, once the claims difficulty had been got out of the way, His Majesty’s Government should press on Ibn Saud their desire for a settlement of the questions outstanding between Saudi Arabia and Koweit and should consider their further action in the light of his reply. 64. When the three alternatives were put to the sheikh on the 10th July, he rejected the first two, but accepted the third, subject to the modest proviso that His Majesty’s Government should undertake to have the blockade removed in the near future under conditions acceptable to him. Ibn Saud had already, however, by this time introduced an entirely new element into the whole situation by a letter of the 1st June, 1933, which reaqlied Koweit on the 16th June. It contained an offer the language of which was obscure, but seemed to mean that, if the sheikh would raise his sea customs duties to the level of those charged in Saudi ports, the King would allow caravans to go into the interior without charging any duty other than an old tribal tax and would guarantee their safety. 65. Consideration of the positions taken up by the two rulers led His Majesty’s Government to form the opinion in July that, while they could obviously not give the sheikh an undertaking to have the blockade removed and contemplated abandonment as the only eventual solution of the claims question, the sheikh’s best course would be to take advantage of Ibn Saud’s spontaneous advance to meet it with some counter-suggestion which would have the appearance of a modification of the King’s proposal rather than a definite rejection of it. At the end of the month, however, they acquiesced in a reply which the sheikh had himself prepared on receipt of the offer. It was couched in language fulsome even for Arabia, but it rejected the suggestion of an increase of Koweit duties. The sheikh expressed readiness to agree to an alternative which had been the subject of discussion between him and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba without the knowledge of the Political Agent, in 1930, viz., that all trade from Koweit should be controlled at a single Saudi post on the frontier, or to consider other solutions, e.g., the creation of a string of customs posts along the frontier. 66. Ibn Saud, in a brief rejoinder, ignored the sheikh’s suggestions, and said, in effect, that he could accept the King’s proposal, or reject it and take the consequent es. It was clear that he had no intention of relaxing his pressure on Koweit except on his own terms. Indeed, when his offer was made there was reason to suspect that it was the first step towards ‘ ‘ a final economic attack on Koweit, and that its rejection would entail a further intensification of the blockade, peihaps, also, a ban on the entry of the Koweit pearlers into Saudi waters which they have always frequented. It was thought about the same time the King might be anxious to see the Koweit oil concession go to the Standard Oil Company of California. 67. Theie was in the event no material alteration in the situation up to the end of the yeai. I he claims question remained in the air. The embargo on trade17 went on much the same as before, to the accompaniment of a good deal of blockade running, the temptation to which was strengthened by the increase of misery in Nejd and the operation of the heavy customs duties imposed by the Saudi Government earlier in the year (see paragraph 122). The menace to the pearlers did not materialise. The question whether Ibn Baud was seeking to impose an oil policy, and, if so, what it was, remained enshrouded in doubt. Ibn Baud’s gesture had so disarranged the cards that His Majesty’s Government did not return to the game, as far as claims and blockade were concerned. Their attention was for the time being diverted to the more general question of Ibn Baud’s fundamental attitude towards Koweit and the possibility of his using inducements to persuade the sheikh that the latter would find it to his interest to stand in with him as a sort of protege, rather than attempt to withstand his pressure. These problems were considered at an inter-departmental conference in London on the 5th October with the object of devising means whereby our ascendancy over the sheikh might be maintained. As final decisions on the problems discussed had not been reached up to the end of the year, any further examination of them can best be reserved for next year’s report. 68. The Koweit neutral zone came in for an unusual amount of attention in 1933 for two reasons. Early in the year Ibn Baud’s consent was obtained to a survey of the zone by the Royal Air Force, on the understanding that the results of this purely technical operation should not be binding on the Saudi Government for eventual purposes of delimitation. This survey was completed in November. The King, having passed his word, placed no obstacles in the way of the operations, though he at least once displayed an interest, perhaps not uncharged with suspicion, by sending an armed party to “ protect ” the surveyors. The petroleum potentialities of the zone also brought it into evidence. Major Frank Holmes appeared to be making efforts to engineer a regrant of a concession which the Eastern and General Syndicate claimed to have obtained in 1924. The syndicate had in 1927 transferred its rights under this concession, and any further rights it might acquire, to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company. On the other hand, the Saudi Government, when giving the Hasa oil concession to the Standard Oil Company of California (see paragraph 128), undertook in a secret agreement to grant that company preference on equal terms, as far as they were concerned, in respect of any concession for the neutral zone. This fact did not come fully to light until January 1934, and the somewhat curious developments must be reserved for the next report. All that need be said here is that there are indications that Ibn Baud may not be as anxious to see an extension of the activities of the Standard Oil Company of California into Koweit and the neutral zone as he seemed likely to be in 1933. (B) With Powers outside Arabia. (1) British Commonwealth of Nations. 69. As in the report for 1932, this sub-section is confined to relations between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. No question affecting the self-governing Dominions arose in 1933. The Government of India and certain colonial Governments are naturally interested in many questions connected with Saudi Arabia, but none of them can be isolated as being outside the scope of her relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. These relations turned mainly on subjects which are dealt with elsewhere in this report, notably the Transjordan-Saudi treaty negotiations and the evolution of the Saudi-Yemeni situation. Ibn Saud became positively keen on the settlement with Transjordan, once it was clear that His Majesty’s Government was prepared to back the bond of the Amir Abdullah, and he professed to rely greatly on their advice in regard to his dispute with the Imam. Other important subjects, which might have given rise to dispute, remained more or less in abeyance. In these circumstances, relations generally throughout the year were good and may be described as friendly, provided that it be borne in mind that the value in Ibn Sand’s eyes of the friendship shown him by His Majesty’s Government is impaired by their policy of showing at least equal friendship to other Arab rulers, by their inability to give him material assistance and to some extent by their hardness in regard to various matters, e.g., debts and [10178] b 9slavery. On Ibn Sand’s side, his friendship in any case is always coloured by Islamic feeling and Arab suspicion. He gave a notable proof of the latter in the letter to the Sheikh of Koweit mentioned in paragraph 64 above. He suggested that the blockade question should be settled secretty between the sheikh and himself, and in a later passage said, with obvious reference to His Majesty s Government, “ May God protect us from her evils. At the moment she is on friendly terms with us, but we greatly fear the consequences. My reasons for saying this are many, but my proofs are clear as the sunshine.” 70. The following paragraphs deal with the more important matters of political interest which engaged attention during the year and which are not dealt with in special sections of the report. Matters of less political interest are reserved for Section XIII. 71. Harameyn Wakfs. —The Saudi Government continue to pursue, rather disjointedly, their efforts to secure for the Hejaz the advantages which they think should accrue from the pious foundations created in other Moslem countries for the benefit of the Holy Places. They were advised in 1932 how to proceed in regard to Wakfs in Palestine, and decided, in the first instance, to collect such information as they could by their own means. They did not ask for further assistance in 1933. Various British authorities were at pains to obtain information regarding the one other Wakf, in which the Saudi mission had manifested special interest in London in May 1932. It was not possible, however, to make any final communication to the Saudi Government up to the end of the year regarding this Wakf, one created under the will of an Indian who had died in Java, leaving property in Burma, and had provided that part of his estate should be applied to the benefit of the poor of the Holy Cities and of his place of origin in the Bombay Presidency. 72. Future of the Treaty of Jedda and the Question of Aqaba and Maan .— The question of Aqaba and Maan was revived during the year in the circum stances related in paragraphs 22 and 35 above. All that need be added here is that this gave rise to some private conversation between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey Hamza regarding the future of the Treaty of Jedda, which either party is free to denounce at six months’ notice any time after the 17th March, 1934. Fuad Bey’s language indicated that Ibn Saud was unlikely to wish to denounce the treaty, but might take advantage of its denunciability to reopen the Aqaba Maan questions and that of slavery. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government in event of his taking this course was considered in a preliminary way during Sir Andrew Ryan’s stay in England in the autumn. 73. Hejaz Railway. —Fuad Bey Hamza’s proceedings in Egypt and Syria in the early autumn of 1933 gave rise to a good deal of gossip on this subject and to a belief that it was to be discussed anew, or was even already under discussion, with the French authorities in Syria, or with both the British and French authorities concerned. There was no truth in this as regards any reopening of the question with His Majesty’s Government. As regards Syria, it seems probable that, following on interviews which he had given to the press in Egypt, Fuad Bey was drawn into informal discussion of the subject in Syria. On the 28th December, however, he assured Sir Andrew Ryan that there had been no sort of negotiations and that, if the Saudi Government reopened the question, as they had it in mind to do, they would approach His Majesty’s Government in the first instance. 74. British Negotiations with the Yemen. —The long preliminaries leading up to the despatch of a British mission to Sana to negotiate a treaty with the Imam came to a head just when the tension between the Imam and Ibn Saud had reached an acute stage. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom decided that this could not stand in the way of their arrangements, but in November they explained their position semi-ofhcially to the Saudi Government. I hey added that, far from implying any weakening of their friendly dispositions towards Saudi Arabia, the establishment of contact with the Imam would, they hoped, enable them to exercise a moderating influence, if, when the mission reached Sana, the direct negotiations between the Imam and Ibn Saud had not already produced a detente. Ibn Saud and Fuad Bey Hamza manifested some little misgiving, but put a good face on the matter. ^[10178] k IQ 10 75. Alleged Murder' of State Prisoners at Riyadh .—It was widely and categorically rumoured at Koweit in the autumn that three leaders concerned in the Nejd rebellion of 1929, who had been imprisoned at Riyadh, had been done to death. Two of these were among the fugitive rebels surrendered by the British authorities to Ibn Saud early in 1930. Sir Andrew Ryan therefore took the matter up in a friendly manner on the 29th December with Fuad Bey, who, in due course, conveyed to him the King’s assurance that the men were alive. Information received in the interval made it seem probable that the prisoners had not been killed, but had been removed from Riyadh to more rigorous confinement at Hofuf. (2) France and Syria. 76. There were no overt developments in the relations between France and Saudi Arabia in the early part of 1933. The French representative in Jedda lives the life of a recluse when at his post and shows no outward signs of political activity, although he is probably kept well informed by his Algerian Moslem vice-consul. In the spring the consulate was stirred out of its appearance of apathy in regard to all matters except a moderate amount of pilgrimage work by a scandalous adventure. A certain Mme. D’Andhurin, a French woman of some birth and education, well known in Syria as an hotel keeper at Palmyra, wished to make the pilgrimage, to obtain copy, it was said, for a book. She conceived the original plan of marrying a Nej di for the purpose and was duly wedded to him at Haifa, after the French authorities in Syria had successfully opposed the union. When the couple came to Jedda, the Saudi Government refused permission to the wife to go to Mecca. She languished in Jedda while the bridegroom made the pilgrimage alone. Very soon after his return to Jedda he died in suspicious circumstances. The lady was arrested on the charge of having poisoned him and was held in prison some three months. The French consulate could not intervene officially as Mme. D’Andhurin had acquired Saudi nationality, but they interested themselves unofficially in the case, which was the more embarrassing for M. Maigret, as his son, a good-looking ne’er-do-well, had been intimate with the accused and had to be whisked away very quickly after the arrest. She was eventually acquitted and left Jedda on the 5th July, seen off by the Algerian vice-consul and demurely attired in widow’s weeds. 77. A month later the French Charge d’Affaires left for Syria for the second time in 1933. It presently became known that he had obtained permission or been invited to go to Riyadh on his return, a journey without recent precedent, as far as any diplomatic representative is concerned, although the King had recently allowed Mr. Twitchell to go there. After various delays, M. Maigret returned to Jedda on the 3rd December and left on the 11th December for Riyadh, accompanied by Fuad Bey Hamza. It had by this time become apparent that there was more of a business side to the affair than had at first been admitted. Curiosity would have been a sufficient motive to take M. Maigret to Nejd,^ but Ibn Saud does not encourage mere curiosity in regard to the interior of his country. After M. Maigret returned on the 21st December, he himself stuck to the story that the King, knowing him to be a friend of this country and of Islam, had' kindly invited him to visit Riyadh to gratify his passion for travel and to enable him to add to the material for a projected book. Fuad Bey told Sir Andrew Ryan in confidence a very different story. He dismissed the more picturesque rumours to which the episode had given rise, that the French were offering the throne of Syria to a Saudi prince, that they were intervening in the Saudi-Yemen quarrel or that they were following up negotiations in regard to the Hejaz Railway, which Fuad Bey himself was supposed to have initiated when in Syria last autumn (see paragraph 73). The facts, according to Fuad Bey, were that, when he and the Amir Feisal were in Paris in 1932, they had explored the possibility of obtaining assistance from the French Government in the shape of facilities for war material and a market loan, as well as a mission to help with military organisation and the Saudi air force. M. Maigret had been invited to Riyadh, he said (without disclosing much of what had happened in the interval), to convey the reply of the French Government to the desiderata of the Saudi Government.20 78. Fuad Bey’s version of the facts was probably accurate in essentials, although his language implied that matters were more advanced than they seem, in fact, to have been. It is still not known what, if any, assistance the French Government are prepared to give, or on what terms. It may be noted as a side light that the Koweiti mentioned in paragraph 91 below was in touch last summer with the French as well as with the German and Italian Legations in Bagdad. 79. Nothing was heard during the year of further negotiations for the commercial agreement in regard to trade between Syria and Saudi Arabia,. The political affairs of Syria are doubtless followed closely by Ibn Saud and his more intelligent advisers. Reference has been made above to the rumour of a Saudi candidature for the Syrian throne. It seems one of the least probable of the various solutions that have been canvassed, although, in his conversation with Sir Andrew Ryan on the 28th December, Fuad Bey based his denial, not so much on the improbability of such a candidature, as on the consideration that the French were committed to a policy in Syria which turned on its having a republican Constitution and any modification of which would raise complicated questions. (3) Italy. 80. Fuad Bey Hamza informed Sir Andrew Ryan on the the 9th January that the incident resulting from the proceedings of an Italian sloop off Asir in December 1932 (see paragraph 75 of the last report) had been closed after an exchange of friendly explanations. He represented the Italian Government as having admitted that there had been a breach of international practice and said that they had given assurances of their entirely friendly dispositions towards Ibn Saud, of whom they asked only that he should not quarrel with “ their friend,” i.e., the Imam Yahya. Fuad Bey did not state that the Italians had expressly recognised the King’s rights over Asir, although his language implied that they had not contested them. The probability is that, on this and subsequent occasions, they have left themselves a loophole for asserting more definitely in case of need the theory, which they have sustained with increasing vigour in their correspondence with His Majesty’s Government, that the King has acquired no valid title to Asir. 81. The King of Italy seems to have been the only foreign Sovereign to send a personal message of congratulation to the Amir Saud on his designation as Heir Apparent. Even this gracious gesture did not prevent the growth of the quarrel between Ibn Saud and the Imam from inflaming, not unjustly, Saudi suspicions of Italian policy. Ibn Saud mistrusts the friendship of the Italian Government for the Imam. He resents the facilities afforded to his enemies for using Eritrea as a base of activities and for shipping supplies to the opposite coast. He is very ready to think that the Italian authorities are not merely tolerant of, but parties to, such activities. The Saudi Government were gratified, however, by a communication made to them in November by the Italian representative in Jedda. M. Tonci conveyed definite assurances of the friendliness of the Italian Government, who intended to preserve good relations with both Ibn Saud and the Imam and deplored mischievous rumours and press reports of Italian lack of sympathy. 82. The Italian representation in Jedda was weak during the year as the Minister appointed last year had no heart in his job and, having gone on leave on the 2nd June, engineered a transfer. The Charge d’Affaires whom he left behind is an ardent Fascist, but a man of queer manners and impetuous disposition. More interest appears to be taken in Arab affairs by the Italian Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad, who has an itch to get into Nejd. He was learning Arabic and growing a beard in March in anticipation of an expedition to Hail and Riyadh, and seemed not only to have curious relations with King Feisal, but to be flirting with the idea of a restoration of the Beni Rashid. If he had any backing from his Government in intrigues to reinstate that dynasty or to promote a Hashamite revival in the Hejaz, they would indeed be playing with fire. Anyhow, it is very unlikely that Signor Porta would be a welcome visitant in Nejd. In this connexion it is worth mentioning that the Italian Legation in Bagdad was one of the missions there visited by the Koweiti mentioned in paragraph 91 below.m [10178] b 11 21 (4) Netherlands. 83. The Dutch financial adviser engaged by the Saudi Government under the auspices of the Netherlands Government in 1932 was as unsuccessful as might have been expected. He ruined his health into the bargain and, having finally left Jedda on the 18th May, died in Holland on the 7th July. 84. There were no signs of any Dutch political activity during 1933 in regard to Saudi Arabia. The Netherlands Legation in Jedda seems to concern itself with little but its pilgrimage work, the volume of which was again diminished by a further heavy falling off in the number of pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies. If the Saudi Government felt any surprise at the conclusion of a treaty between the Netherlands Government and the Imam of the Yemen, when the Dutch Charge d’Affaires was in Sana last March, it was well contained. They cannot have failed to be impressed by this action on the part of a Government who have never made a treaty with Ibn Saud, and they may have felt some little discomfort at the end of the year, when it became known that, notwithstanding the acuteness of the Saudi-Yemen situation, M. Adriaanse was contemplating another visit to Sana early in 1934 for the exchange of ratifications of the treaty signed last March. 85. Ibn Saud, though apparently guarded in his attitude towards the Hadhramaut (see paragraph 54), takes an interest in the quarrel, having its roots in that region, which rages in Java between the rival Moslem factions. One of them are the Seyyids, who claim descent from Huseyn the son of Ali. The most vigorous exponent of opposition to them is an association called Al-Irshad. The cause of the latter was warmly espoused towards the end of 1932 by one of two journalists, who are among the emissaries used by the Saudi Government to stimulate the flow of pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies. This man, a rolling stone from Iraq named Yunus Bahri, seems, however, to have outrun the wishes of Ibn Saud, for the King was reported in March 1933 to have addressed a letter to Al-Irshad, which produced at least an outward mitigation of that party’s animosity towards the Seyyids, and moved their counter-association to send a grateful letter to the King. It is probable that the religious and political sympathies of the latter would lie with Al-Irshad, but his greatest interest of all is to see a revival of the pilgrimage from the Dutch East Indies. That, and perhaps his desire for peace among Arabs in the homeland of the combatants, may explain his readiness to exert a composing influence. (5) Soviet Russia. 86. Much excitement was caused in Jedda in February 1933 by a report that the Soviet had at last arrived at a commercial understanding with the Saudi Government. It was understood that the Soviet Minister, using as a lever the still outstanding claim for benzine and petroleum to the value of £30,000 supplied under a special arrangement in 1931, had secured a partial or total removal of the ban on direct trade from Russia and had agreed that the old debt should be paid off by the total or partial remission of customs duty on goods newly imported, a mode of payment much used by the Saudi Government in the case of their creditors. There was much alarm in local circles as to the effect on other sources of supply and on local merchants of any large influx of Russian goods, perhaps to be supplied under some sort of loan arrangement and to be marketed no one knew how. 87. On the 18th March His Majesty’s Minister questioned Fuad Bey Hamza as to what had actually happened. Fuad Bey stated that, when the Saudi mission visited Moscow at the end of May 1932, the Soviet Government had expressed a desire for three things, viz., a removal of the embargo on trade from Russia to Saudi Arabia, a treaty of friendship and a commercial treaty. They had expressed readiness to accommodate the Saudi Government in a manner which Fuad Bey described vaguely. His language suggested that the offer was to make a loan in the shape of goods on terms of either long or short credit. The Saudi Government, he said, were unwilling to commit themselves for more than a short term, say, three years. Fuad Bey admitted that the exchange of views in Moscow had led to further negotiations, and that they had had a result, but only one result, namely, the removal of the embargo, which had not, however, yet become effective as the Soviet Government had undertaken not to ship goods until the Saudi Government had had time to organise selling arrangements.88. This Soviet success was not followed, as had been anticipated, by a rush of Russian goods. On the contrary, the Soviet Government discontinued at the end of August the service of steamers from the Black Sea, which had called at Jedda about once a month. Nothing more was heard of the deal between the two Governments up to the end of the year. The debt of £30,000 remains unpaid, but it is thought that the Soviet Legation does hold drafts on customs in respect of it. 89. It is possible that the Saudi Government have let things slide, as far as they are concerned, for political reasons. When the trouble with the Yemen blew up, they accused the Soviet, hardly less than the Italian Government, of supporting the Imam. The evidence on which this accusation rests is not known to the British Legation in Jedda, except that the Saudis were in the summer full of a story, which has not been verified, that a Russian ship passed through the Suez Canal carrying arms, &amp;c., for the Imam. 90. The Russian Legation in Jedda continues to present the appearance of being more interested in commerce than in politics. It also presents the appearance of being rather starved by the home Government, and had no superior personnel at the end of 1933 except the Minister and a newly-imported doctor. Reports are heard from time to time of Communist activities in Moslem circles in Mecca, and there are more meagre indications of something of the same sort in Medina. It cannot be said how far propaganda is organised, or whether, if organised, it is directed by the Soviet Legation in Jedda or through other agencies. It probably amounts to little more than a certain infiltration of Communist doctrine into religious teaching, and the sporadic activity of Indians and other agitators with Communist leanings. (6) Germany. 91. All appearance of direct relations between Germany and Saudi Arabia ceased with the departure of the German trading consul in Jedda in June 1932. He was the last German merchant left and appears to have had too little success to make it worth his while to return. There was, nevertheless, talk during the year of actual or potential deals with German concerns, working outside Germany. A Herr Borchers, who was in Bagdad in November 1932, let it be understood there that his principals in Spain had supplied 3,000 automatic pistols to Ibn Saud and had got a further order that month for 10,000 more. Later in the year it was reported that one Abdul Latif-bin-Abdul Jelal, a very active gentleman from Koweit, who purported to be an emissary from Ibn Saud invested with authority to engage in important transactions in arms, &amp;c., got into touch with several foreign missions in Bagdad, and that the German Minister put him into touch with a German firm in Holland. The Legation in Jedda has no direct knowledge of those alleged dealings. (7) Egypt. 92. During a debate in the Egyptian Parliament early in January Opposition Deputies lamented inter alia the absence of any reference in a Speech from the Throne to a settlement of differences between Egypt and the Hejaz. The Prime Minister assured the Chamber that the attitude of Egypt towards the Saudi Government, though not imposed by any formal treaty, was consistently courteous and referred to the sense of neighbourly duty shown during the Ibn Rifada and Asir revolts. If this meant that King Fuad and his Government were quite ready to treat Ibn Saud correctly, but preferred not to alter the nature of their political relations with him, the policy was adhered to during the year. There were no quarrels and no signs of any real approach to recognition of Ibn Saud or to the settlement of vexed questions like those of the Sacred Caravan and Harameyn Waqfs. 93. A non-political factor, which may have ultimate political consequences, came into the situation in December, when Talat Pasha Harb, the chairman of the board of the Banque Misr, paid a spectacular visit to the Hejaz, all the more spectacular as he arrived by air, a revolutionary innovation. One of his objects was to make local arrangements in connexion with the transport of Egyptian pilgrims by sea, in pursuance of the arrangement made some time before between the Egyptian Government and the Banque Misr, whereby the latter secured a monopoly of this transport. The Egyptian interests concerned had bought at23 ~1 } i l least two ships, and it was necessary to make agency arrangements for them. Talat Pasha had, however, further objects. He hoped to organise the sale of Egyptian products, especially textiles, in the Hejaz, to explore the possibilities of establishing a local branch of the Banque Misr, to pursue the idea previously broached in Egypt of arranging for the transport of pilgrims by air, and, perhaps, to stimulate interest in Misr Airworks aeroplanes. The visit was marked by great cordiality on both sides. Talat Pasha made the round of Jedda, Mecca, Medina and Yambu. He received much hospitality and distributed largesse in goods on a considerable scale, both to the poor and the not so poor, besides presenting a good supply of cotton wool and bandages to the Public Health Department. It remains to be seen in 1934 what can be made of his various projects, whether the Banque Misr is prepared to give financial assistance to the Saudi Government, and, if so, on what terms. (8) Turkey. 94. Nothing seems to have come of the suggestions mentioned in para graph 83 of the report for 1932, that Turkey might send to Saudi Arabia missions to help with her air service and her military organisation, or might undertake the training of Saudi youths. There was, indeed, no sign of any development of the relations between the two countries in 1933. (9) Persia. 95. The last sentence of the preceding paragraph applies mutatis mutandis to the relations between Saudi Arabia and Persia. The Governments as such seem to take very little interest in each other. The number of pilgrims from Persia was greater in 1933 than in 1932, and is expected to show a more marked increase in 1934. Shias generally were treated with more consideration than in previous years, a matter more of politic tolerance in Islam than of special friendliness towards Persia. (10) Afghanistan. 96. Various Afghan notabilities, including the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, visited the Hejaz for the pilgrimage. The Minister was, how ever, on sick leave, and the opportunity was not taken of exchanging the ratifications of the Saudi-Afghan Treaty of the 5th May, 1932. It is understood that arrangements for an exchange of ratifications in Cairo were being made later in the year, but were upset by the death of Nadir Shah. 97. The only important development in the relations between the two countries was the appointment of the Afghan consul at Bombay to exercise the same functions at Jedda. The intention of the Afghan Government for the time being was merely, it seemed, to detach him for duty in the Hejaz at pilgrimage time. His first visit was extremely short as he did not arrive until the 16th March and left on the 25th April. The number of Afghan pilgrims again showed an increase and the elementary arrangements made by the Afghan Government in 1932 for assisting them in Mecca were maintained. (H) United States of America. 98. The grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Standard Oil Company of California in May (see paragraph 128) doubtless helped to stimulate American interest in Saudi Arabia, which had already had exponents like Mr. C. R. Crane and Mr. Twitched. Anyhow, a considerable step forward in the development of relations between the Governments was made on the 7th November, 1933, when the United States and Saudi representatives in London signed a “Provisional Agreement .... in regard to Diplomatic and Consular Representation, Juridical Protection, Commerce and Navigation.” This rather curious instru ment purported to confirm and record an understanding arrived at in conversa tions. It contained no mention of full powers. It was made terminable at thirty days’ notice, or at a moment’s notice by the United States, if the future action of the United States Legislature should prevent its execution. No provision was made for ratification. Its most important substantial provision was a reciprocal guarantee of unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment in regard24 to charges on commerce and navigation, as well as in respect of transit, &amp;c. An ensuing article embodied a number of reservations of one sort or another. No mention was made of the slave trade or the manumission of slaves. 99. Towards the end of the year the Standard Oil Company of California installed a permanent representative at Jedda, who is understood to aspire to the position of United States consul. The preference of the Saudi Government ** for Big Business as compared with other forms of American activity was illustrated at the end of December, when a party of three anthropologists, two male and one female, came to Jedda only to find that there was no open door for skull measurers in Saudi Arabia. (12) Other Countries. 100. Saudi Arabia cannot be said to have had serious relations with any other countries in 1933. Poland still whistled faintly for the money due in respect of the arms, &amp;c., supplied to Ibn Saud in 1930. The Vatican included all Arabia in the jurisdiction of a new Apostolic delegate for Palestine, Egypt, &amp;c., but, in the circumstances described in paragraph 180, it is likely to be long before there is any intercourse between the Imam of the Wahhabis and the Pope. (C) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 101. The aloofness of the Saudi Government from any important partici pation in the family life of the nations was almost greater in 1933 than in 1932. They, however, sent their Director-General of Public Health to both meetings of International Health Office in Paris. They were represented by their Minister in London at the World Economic Conference held there in June and July. They were a little worried lest, owing to the anomalous state of their relations with Egypt, they might not receive an invitation in proper form to the meeting of the International Postal Congress intended to be held in Cairo in February 1934, but the invitation was in due course received during the summer and was duly accepted. 102. The question of the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations (see paragraphs 107-8 of the report for 1931 and paragraph 93 of that for 1932) was not pursued in Jedda. On the 3rd March, however, the Saudi Minister in London referred to the subject in conversation with Sir L. Oliphant and asked for the views and advice of His Majesty’s Government. The discussion bore on three particular points. The Minister agreed that, if Saudi Arabia were at any time to seek admission to the League, the request would have to come as from a new country. He made light of the possible difficulty presented by the League’s requirement that an applicant State must have established and well-defined frontiers. When it was pointed out that the continuance of slavery might be severely criticised at Geneva, he invoked the precedent of Abyssinia and added the remarkable statement that Ibn Saud felt that, if his country were a member of the League, the League might help him in the matter of anti-slavery measures. He reverted to the subject on the 11th May, stating that his Government were not asking for a definite promise of support from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, but would be glad to know whether an application by Saudi Arabia would be favourably viewed by them. On being reminded of the difficulties previously adverted to, he agreed not to press for an immediate answer. 103. These conversations led to a re-examination of the subject as viewed by His Majesty’s Government. The results were set forth in an important Foreign Office despatch to Jedda dated the 17th May. A fresh analysis of the pros and cons led to a conclusion rather less favourable than that in the passage from Mr. Henderson’s earlier despatch, which was reproduced in paragraph 107 of the report for 1931. Special attention was given to the possible effect of the uncertainty as regards boundaries. It was not thought (but the despatch was written before the Saudi-Yemen quarrel had entered its acute stage, and before the question of the boundary of Qatar had assumed its present importance) that this uncertainty would be a serious obstacle. It was not thought desirable to25 raise the question prematurely lest a delicate situation should be created in regard to the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia. Subject to what was said on this aspect of the matter, Sir Andrew Ryan was instructed, on more general grounds, to adopt an attitude of complete, but sympathetic, neutrality, if the Saudi Government showed signs of wishing to press the matter. He was to give the Saudi Government any information they might require; to refrain from anything which might be taken for a rebuff; but, at the same time, not to minimise the obstacles in the way of their candidature and to do nothing to encourage them to proceed hastily. 104. On the 28th December the Legation conveyed to the Saudi Government an invitation from the Royal Anthropological Institute to the first session of the new International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sessions to be held in London from the 30th July to the 4th August, 1934, with the approval of His Majesty’s Government, though without having any official character. It was just as this moment that the Saudi Government were showing that coldness towards anthropology in the home, which has been mentioned in paragraph 99, but early in 1934 they proved their readiness to show an intelligent interest in it abroad by instructing Sheikh Hafiz Wahba to attend the congress. (D) T reaties. 105. The following table shows the only formal international agreements entered into by the Saudi Government in 1933. The numbering is continued from that of the appendices to the report for 1931 and 1932. These appendices still hold good, except as regards the United States of America, which country is still not represented in Saudi Arabia, but has concluded the provisional agreement described in paragraph 98 above :— Treaties concluded by Ibn Sand in 1933 (see Appendix No. 1 to report for 1931 and Appendix to report for 1932, the numbering in which is continued) : — With (Country).

III. —Internal Affairs. General Situation. 106. Ibn Saud again spent most of the year in Nejd, visiting the Hejaz only from the 27th March to the 21st June. On the occasion of his first visit to Jedda he seemed ill and worried, but on the whole he appears to keep in good health. He has become increasingly enamoured of country life and hunting, and when in Nejd he found plenty of time for outings from Riyadh, especially9HKBR 26 to a place called Rawdhat-al-Khafs. There were some slight indications in the early summer that His Majesty might be contemplating an ultimate abdication in favour of his eldest son, whose designation as heir apparent is dealt with below. 107. After the collapse of the revolt in Asir Ibn Saud had no major internal difficulties to cope with until late in the year, when his quarrel with the Imam of the Yemen brought in its train trouble among tribes on the frontier whom he claims as Saudi. The tribes elsewhere seemed to be loyal, even though in parts of the Hejaz tribal loyalty may be merely the cowed submission of people many of whom have been reduced to misery, and farther east there is probably more discontent than appears on the surface, e.g., among the Mutair. In the autumn there were many reports of the difficulty of inducing certain tribes to proceed to the southern front. Some were said to have been excused, but whenever the King insisted, he seemed to have his way in the end. Thus, despite talk of disaffection among the Ateyba, their best-known present leader Ibn Rubayyan, decided to obey. Of the tribes most prominent in the rebellion of 1929, the Mutair were probably the most sullen, while the Ajman were thought to be readier to go south, owing to their relationship with the Beni Yam of Najran. 108. The King would appear to have a good hold on the settled folk of the so-called towns in the interior. There is at least one curious exception in the case of the Teima oasis, which maintains a precarious quasi-independence. It was reported in November and December that the people there were angered by a letter from the King to their chief, Ibn Rumman, calling upon him, it was said, to allow a wireless station to be installed and to accept the position of a paid Saudi Governor. 109. Asir has become the heel of Saudi Arabia, and may prove to be an Achilles’ heel. Before describing the course of events there in 1933, a mistake in paragraph 107 of the report for 1932 needs to be corrected. It became apparent early in 1933 that the separate force said to have been sent under the King’s nephew, Khalid-bin-Muhammad, was a myth, and that the Commanders- in-chief from the north and north-east were Ibn Saud’s cousin, Abdul Aziz-bin- Musaid, Governor of Hail, and the redoubtable old warrior Khalid-bin-Luwey. The latter died on the last march from Abha to Sabya in or about December 1932. Ibn Musaid was invested with the supreme command in Asir. 110. By the end of 1932 the rebellion was already at an end along the coast. The Saudi forces had swept south as far as the Wadi Tashar, an operation which was completed later, probably early in 1933, by the occupation of Muwassim, a place said to be about 5 miles north of Medi. On the 1st January the troops took the first important step towards subduing the revolt inland by occupying Abu Arish. Hasan-al-Idrisi escaped from that place and was on the run in the highlands toward the borders of Yemen, until he took refuge in that country with the results described in paragraph 37 above. Ibn Musaid’s task was to deal with the rebel remnants in the mountains. It is not known how numerous or how coherent these were early in the year, but they included portions of important tribes like the Masariha and others. Ibn Saud’s policy was to combine punitive action with promises of pardon. The Government claimed in a communique issued on the 24th February that the situation had been completely restored. Ibn Musaid was left to reorganise Asir. He had completed this task by May, when he returned from the south. The territory, of which the Idrisi had been the ruler before 1926 and in which he had retained a shadow of authority even after 1930, was made into an ordinary Saudi province under the name of Tihamat Asir. It was to be administered by a Governor, assisted by a council of ten, including seven local notables, under the general supervision of a Governor-General of Asir residing at Abha. 111. The Saudi Government attached considerable importance in 1933 to the distinction between what they had previously called the Idrisi territory and now renamed Tihamat Asir, and the hinterland of which Abha is the capital, and which they call Asir Surat. The reasons for this distinction have been given in paragraph 50 ff above as they are more important on their bearing on the Saudi Yemen situation than in connexion with the internal administration of Saudi Arabia. *27 112. It was proposed early in the year to make Ibn Musaid himself Governor-General of Asir. This plan was abandoned, and in the spring it was decided to appoint as Governor-General Turki As-Sdayry, previously Governor of Jauf in the north and a connexion by marriage of Ibn Sand. A certain Hamad Ash-Shuwayir was made Governor of Tihamat Asir. 113. During the remainder of the year both parts of Asir presented an appearance of complete tranquillity. It was not certain, however, how far Ibn Saud made his authority effective in the mountainous regions towards the Yemen. Posts were apparently established at various places, but it is note worthy that, as the quarrel with the Imam developed, the loyalty of the tribes to Ibn Saud became more and more doubtful, and, as described in paragraph 46 above, some of them actually revolted. The King held the Imam, or at any rate his subordinates acting in conjunction with Abdul Wahhab-al-Idrisi, responsible for this outbreak. He also accused the Imam’s people of tampering with the Masariha and other tribes. In fact the principal tribes concerned in the rebellion of 1932, on whom Ibn Saud claimed to have imposed his will, seemed to be reappearing as factors in the dispute between him and the Imam. Constitutional Development and Administration. 114. When Ibn Saud’s dominions were unified under their present name in September 1932, it was announced (see paragraph 112 of the last report) that a single Constitution would be drawn up in due course, and a rule of succession to the throne would be established. No progress seems to have been made with the new Constitution, and, indeed, it is difficult to imagine how a system could readily be devised to meet the requirements of so diversified a country and people. The Council of Ministers appears, however, to have more or less tacitly become a council for the whole country. There are indications, in the Hejaz at any rate, that the King increasingly observes certain constitutional forms, e.g., as regards the manner in which he communicates his decisions through the Amir Feisal as President of the Council. In the sphere of foreign affairs he certainly with draws himself more and more behind the screen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, he has not repeated the 1931 experiment of convoking a partly elective National Conference of urban representatives, which was to be annual, and in all important matters he retains supreme control. It may be noted as a minor sign of the times that in 1933 official communiques began to be numbered and dated. 115. The most spectacular constitutional development of the year was the solemn proclamation of the King’s eldest surviving son in May as heir apparent. This was done in accordance with precedents for the Baya or swearing of fealty to an heir during the lifetime of a sovereign, of which the first great example was the choice of a successor to the Caliph Muawiya in the person of his son Yezid, and of which there was at least one notable instance in the earlier history of the House of Saud. On the present occasion everything was done, as stated in the Introduction, to make the selection of the heir appear to be the election of a unanimous people, endorsed by the King and to commit the remainder of the Royal Family to acceptance of it. The heir himself remained at Riyadh, while his brother Feisal and the local Governors received the Baya of the people of the Hejaz. Then Feisal and a posse of princes waited on the Amir Saud at Riyadh. He and the King exchanged telegrams and letters full of injunctions on the one side and piety on the other. Full justice cannot be done in the space available to this great affair, but two of the King's injunctions are worth recording. He bade his son respect the ulema, who were like stars adorning the sky, guiding travellers and warning devils away, but added that they were of two kinds, those who shone both in knowledge and counsel, and those who had knowledge but whose opinions should not necessarily be followed. He also bade him to pay the utmost attention to foreign affairs, remembering that the relations of States are founded on exchange of benefits and inter-dependence of interests. He recommended close study of the policy of other countries to a prince whose duty it would be to promote the welfare of his own and defend it against enemies. Beware, he said, “of statements made to you in the apparent form of advice, while inwardly something else is meant.’’ But the policy of the prince towards other States should be based, both outwardly and inwardly, on friendship and peace; and he should be mindful of his duty towards all Moslems and Arabs.28 116. Lesser developments in the administrative sphere were, the announce ment in June of the creation of councils to assist Governors, the adoption, officially announced to the foreign missions, of a Royal Great Seal, and an important redistribution of provincial governorates which illustrated the King’s tendency to install wherever possible Nejdis enjoying his confidence. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs was strengthened somewhat in personnel, if not in organisation, and during the early part of the year Fuad Bey Hamza was a more regular visitor to Jedda than he had been. Various changes in the Departments of State are not worth mentioning in detail, but they afforded some indication of a desire for better organisation. 117. The Keeper of the Key of the Kaaba died on the 4th January, and was succeeded by another senior member of the Shaibis, a family of Quraysh descent, in which the post has been hereditary since before the time of the Prophet. Ibn Saud equipped himself in June with a Poet Laureate in the person of the Secretary of the Legislative Council. IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. Finance. 118. The financial situation of the Saudi Government in 1933 was as hope less as in 1932. If there was a difference between the two years, it was mainly that there was even less method in 1933 in the madness of a Government, who have destroyed their credit in reasonable financial markets, not so much by inability to pay their debts as by the irresponsibility they show in regard to them. The farce of publishing a budget, as had been done towards the end of 1931, was not repeated. The moratorium described in paragraph 118 of the report for 1932 was allowed to run out without payment, or at least any all-round payment, of the interest promised for the year of its duration. When the year expired on the 17th November, no announcement was made of the intentions of the Government. The system of settling debts by drafts presentable at the Customs in part payment of new duty was neither maintained nor abandoned. On the 1st December Fuad Bey Hamza told His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that it had been discontinued in April, but there was reason to believe that it was still resorted to for urgent payments. Official salaries again fell heavily into arrear. Mention is made elsewhere (paragraph 83) of the disappearance from the scene of the Dutch financial adviser, who had been engaged in 1932. 119. There were two excuses for this fecklessness. Early in the year the Government had real hopes of relief by means of the schemes which will presently be described. As these hopes faded in every direction but one, a little later on, the Saudi-Yemen crisis grew into a formidable threat of war, and its growth dislocated all internal arrangements. It became necessary to cut down all ordinary expenditure by fair means or foul, and both were used. 120. The principal scheme from which relief was expected in the early part of the year was mainly a financial one, although it may have had an economic side. In the first days of March Abdul Hamid Bey Shed id, representing the ex-Khedive of Egypt and purporting to have full powers, completed negotiations with the Government for the creation of a national bank with a capital of £1 million gold. Half this capital was to be subscribed by the ex-Khedive’s group. The Saudi Government were to have the option of subscribing £250,000, and it was understood that, in the almost certain event of their not exercising it, the promoters had another source in view. The remaining £250,000 was to be offered for subscription in the Hejaz. The bank was to perform the functions of a State bank and to receive all revenue on deposit. It was to have the privilege of issuing notes, but their use was apparently not to be compulsory at the outset. Its first operation was to be to lend £200,000 gold to the Government. Mr. Philby was promised the post of conseiller to the bank, and one of his hopes was that it might take over the business of Sharqieh (Limited), after it had provided funds for the payment of the large amounts due by the Government to that firm and those for whom it had acted as agent. 121. No one has ever discovered what commercial inducement the promotors had to engage in a scheme so unsound on the face of it. They were possibly promised industrial concessions, but the Saudi Government were already in treaty»33 2t) with other interests for the least unpromising of these prospective sources of profit, Hasa oil. It was suggested in some quarters that the ex-Khedive had political objects, but it was hard to suppose that, even if he were aspiring to the Caliphate or the throne of Syria, he would value any support he might obtain from Ibn Saud at £200,000. Anyhow, despite the opposition of the Dutch financial adviser and a Syrian group of merchants, Shed id had the concession in his pocket when he left Jedda on the 10th March, together with a tidy little sum of £2,500 advanced by the Saudi Government for initial expenses. Little or nothing more was heard of him in the Hejaz until it became apparent in the autumn that the ex-Khedive had disowned him; and a little later still that no basis could be found for a revised agreement with Abbas Hilmi Pasha. He and Shedid definitely parted company, one of their quarrels being as to the liability for the £2,500. 122. Deprived of the expected windfall from the bank, the Saudi Government had no other of any importance until they received the first payment of £35,000 in respect of the Hasa concession described below, and this they or the King nursed carefully in view of the prospect of war with the Yemen. They had to struggle on as best they could with their ordinary resources. It is harder than ever to form an estimate of these. The pilgrimage was the smallest of recent years, so that it brought little relief. A new customs tariff was introduced on the 4th May. It provided high specific duties for a number of staple articles and increased ad valorem duties for everything else. I he new system was made applicable to the whole of Saudi Arabia. It increased materially the burdens of the Hejazi importer, though he, poor man, does not react violently. He regards the taxation of Ibn Saud as in some sense the Act of God and an affliction that can be passed on to the consumer, except in some rare cases, as when his Kelly's Directory, dutied as fancy goods, costs him an enormous sum. In Hasa the increase on the old duties levied there was so great that the Political Agent in Koweit described the new duties as “ ferocious ” and as being a strong incentive to smuggling in defiance of Ibn Sand’s ban on trade with the Koweit (see paragraph 63). The increase in revenue from this source cannot have been substantial. There were other less important increases in taxation, e.g., port dues were doubled in July and postal charges were increased. 123. In the spring His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agreed to refund to the Government of India two-thirds of the money which had been due to the latter by the Saudi Government for arms supplied at the time of the Nejd rebellion in 1929. Following on this, the question of recovering this debt and the smaller sum owing as a contribution to the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry in 1930 entered on a new phase of activity. The Legation was instructed to make a vigorous effort in November as soon as the moratorium should expire. After some preliminary efforts to obtain a more satisfactory arrangement, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires put forward in December a minimum proposal that the small MacDonnell debt should be paid at once and interest paid on the larger debt, although His Majesty’s Government still desired that the payment of the principal should not be long delayed. To every proposal the Saudi Government opposed the plea of poverty so grinding that no payment whatsoever could be made. 124. The Legation continued during the year to receive constant complaints from chauffeurs that they could not get payment of the small arrears due to them by the Government or the Government-run transport companies. Otherwise, there were few appeals for assistance from private creditors. Sharqieh (Limited) are debarred from seeking it by the principles of Mr. Philby. He extracted an insignificant sum from the Minister of Finance in the summer, but the Government remain heavily indebted in respect of transactions with Sharqieh and firms which they represent, like the Marconi, Standard Oil of New York and Ford companies. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. put a prudent limit on any new credit transactions with the Government, and the arrangement in respect of the stolen Shell benzine (see paragraph 119 of the last report) worked satisfactorily in 1933. It is only fair to the Saudi Government to say that their Department of Posts and Telegraphs kept the arrears in respect of their monthly cable accounts with the Eastern Telegraph Company within reasonable bounds, and at one moment startled the company by establishing a credit balance.30 125. There was no great change in the monetary situation. The United States of America banking crisis of March 1933 produced a certain transitory mistrust of foreign currencies in the sensitive suqs of Jedda, and the pilgrims’ interests were threatened for a day or two until the situation was restored by responsible houses which knew the difference between impeccable Indian rupees and those chancy dollars. The Saudi riyal went on its dwindling way. At the end p&gt;i m., of the year it stood at about 24 riyals to the gold pound. Economic Conditions and Development. 126. In the absence of subsidies from without, like those paid by Turkey in the old days and by Great Britain during and for some time after the Great War, the pilgrim and the camel are the normal mainsprings of economic life in Saudi Arabia, the former, an importer of wealth in exchange for the invisible export of holiness, has failed her during the last three years, chiefly owing to depression in the countries of origin. The camel had formerly a triple role, as the direct sustainer of Bedouin life, as an article of export and as a means of transport for hire. In the first capacity, he affords simple prosperity if the rains are good, as they were in Nejd early in 1933. But the demand for the exported camel has fallen off in neighbouring countries and, as a means of transport, he has been largely supplanted by the motor vehicle, paid for abroad and fed on fuel from abroad. 127. These basic factors have produced both impoverishment and a dislocation of the distribution system, most perceptible in the towns and among the tribes which supplied camels for the pilgrimage, but pervading the whole of a country on which Ibn Saud makes increasing demands, not so much for the luxury of which he and his family are sometimes accused as for general upkeep of his machine and for military preparations, never so oppressive as in the latter part of 1933. He and his advisers, though not very intelligent in their handling of economic problems, have perceived with increasing clearness the need for developing other resources in addition to the pilgrimage, which has proved so precarious a stand-by. In 1931 they allowed themselves to be hampered by the theoiy that concessions should be given to Moslems only, a theory which was endorsed by the National Conference of Urban Representatives held'in that year. It was abandoned early in 1933, when it was announced that it had become necessary to grant concessions to Moslem or non-Moslem applicants, although the Government hoped that Moslems would come forward. A Moslem, in the person of ARbas Hilmi Pasha, did become the most serious of the competitors for the privilege of creating a State bank, the fate of which project has already been described. It was already clear, however, that non-Moslems w r ere the likeliest candidates foi mining concessions. I he oil possibilities of Hasa were already exciting interest. The main development in this and certain other directions during 1933 are summed up in the following paragraphs. 128. Ihe Standard Oil Company of California and the Iraq Petroleum Company sent representatives to Jedda in February and March respectively to treat for the Hasa oil concession. Both companies found the Saudi Government very exigent, especially as regards money down. After a protracted struggle, Standard Oil of California came to terms with the Minister of Finance^ A contract was signed on the 29th May and was in due course ratified by both sides. The company obtained a concession for the whole of Hasa, in considera tion of a preliminary loan of £50,000 gold, of which £30,000 was to be paid at once, the rest probably after a year; an annual rental of £5,000, pendino- the discovery of oil in commercial quantities; two further loans, believed to have been fixed at £50,000 each, at an interval of a year, when that position should be reached; and a royalty of 4 shillings gold a ton on the oil produced. All loans were to be secured on the eventual royalties. This is believed to be an accurate summary, but the published contract neither defined the area nor stated the amounts of money involved. These and other matters were dealt with in at least one separate and secret agreement. 129. During the negotiations with the Standard Oil Company of California and the Iraq Petroleum Company, Major Frank Holmes, of the Eastern and General Syndicate, created a diversion by visiting Jedda. He appeared to have ideas of his own as to how the Hasa region might be developed, but his immediate31 object was probably connected with the oil potentialities of the Koweit Neutral Zone. This subject has been dealt with in paragraph 68 above. All that need be added here is that, although Major Holmes had got some sort of invitation from the Saudi Government, he left with unexpected rapidity. Since then there has been much reason to believe that Ibn Saud, who has had a grievance against Major Holmes for years, is still hostile to him and that the Standard Oil Company of California have no use for him either. 130. In June Ibn Saud sounded His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as to whether any British group would be interested in an oil concession in Asir and the Farsan Islands, regarding which he had been approached by Italian interests. This led to conversations between Fuad Bey Hamza and a representative of the Iraq Petroleum Company when the former was in Palestine, but the matter was shelved eventually. Even less was heard of potential oil enterprise in the North-Western Hejaz, a subject which, however, interests various people. The Standard Oil Company of California may have their eye on that area, and it certainly interests Mr. Ydlibi, of Manchester, who was mentioned in paragraph 128 (c) of the report for 1932. Towards the end of 1933 this gentleman struck up an alliance with the Eastern and General Syndicate, the outcome of which was the creation of the Arabian Development Syndicate (Limited). The activities of this concern did not, however, become apparent until 1934. 131. The American engineer, Mr. Twitchell, floated on and off the Arabian stage at intervals during 1933. He was connected in some way with the negotiations of the Standard Oil Company of California, but not as their principal representative. He made no apparent progress with his schemes for gold mining. 132. At the beginning of 1933 it looked as though the project for a railway between Jedda and Mecca (see paragraph 128 (d) of the report for 1932) was falling through. In February 1933, however, Dr. S. 0. K. Jeelani obtained a concession on terms very favourable to the Government. He went off to India to get the backing, which he had apparently not previously secured. Up to the end of the year he seemed to be having very little success, and the railway project, though not dead, remained in abeyance. It seemed likely to prove economically unsound, but may still enlist enough religious support for the railway to be built eventually. 133. The Hyderabad! promoters of the scheme of creating a textile industry in the Hejaz, which was mentioned in paragraph 128 (a) of the report for 1932, made some practical progress on a small scale in 1933. A certain amount of money was collected in India, and a certain amount of material was imported into the Hejaz. This, however, must still be regarded rather as a charitable effort to give employment in a moderate scale in the Hejaz than as a serious contribution to its economic development. 134. The question of supplying Jedda with water from Waziriyya, some 10 miles outside the town, excited renewed interest during the year. Mention was made in the report for 1931, paragraph 148, of the erection of a windmill to raise well-water at this spot, under Mr. Twitchell’s auspices, and the efforts made to recondition the old Turkish conduit connecting it with the town. Mr. TwitchelTs installation was not very successful, and in 1933 his method was superseded by that of digging water-galleries, as it were, to collect and canalise the water which abounds in the sub-soil. This system was brought into operation by persons familiar with the arrangements for supplying Mecca. By the end of the year Waziriyya water was actually flowing into a distributing centre in Jedda, although the method of collecting the water had hardly passed out of the experimental stage and the state of the conduit still left much to be desired. 135. Various other schemes were spoken of in one connexion or another during the year. Most of these were no more than the airy visions of would-be concessionnaries, but an Indian firm, Messrs. Ibrahim Jewan Baksh, of Calcutta, made more definite proposals to the Saudi Government for providing a public supply of electricity in Mecca.32 136. Hotels, on what are for the Hejaz modern lines, were opened under Government auspices in Jedda, Mecca and Medina in 1933. They were designed primarily for well-to-do pilgrims, but the hotel in Jedda has been a boon to concession hunters and sundry other visitors as well. Communications, Roads and Ports. 137. The external communications of Jedda improved somewhat during the year, a good deal owing to the maintenance by the Khedivial Mail Line of weekly services with both Suez and Port Sudan. Private wireless sets have increased the facilities for receiving foreign news, although there is still no telegraphic news service. On the Persian Gulf side, arrangements for postal communication between Hasa and the outer world in Bahrein were completed in the summer. Certain improvements were effected in internal communications. An urban telephone service was brought into operation at Riyadh in addition to the existing services in Jedda and Mecca. The last two are interconnected by land-line and the wireless system enables telephonic communications to be exchanged between these three places and certain other centres. Internal postal services seem to have been somewhaf augmented and more or less regular communication by motor launch seems now to exist between Jedda and Jezan. 138. Apart from the repairs to the roads between Mecca and Taif the only important road development reported in 1933 was the improvement of the road from Bisha to Abha, so as to facilitate the through journey by car to the latter place. It was stated in November that this had made it possible to drive from Mecca to Abha in five days. Reference is made in paragraph 10 to the slow progress of the scheme for a motor route from Iraq to the Hejaz. The delays in this connexion have prevented the realisation of larger schemes for through motor routes from India. There has also been talk of a route from Syria, which might join up with the proposed route from Iraq. 139. It must be understood that all roads in Saudi Arabia are still of the most primitive description, and, on the other hand, no road is necessary in many parts to enable even motor cars to make their way across the desert. It may be noted as an example of enterprise that in 1933 two pilgrims claimed plausibly to have come all the way from India on bicycles. One got as far as A1 Ula, the other as far as Medina, but at these places they fell among tax-gatherers and were reduced to continuing on foot. 140. There is even less to be said about port improvements in 1933, except as regards Ras Tanura, which the Saudi Government would like to develop in competition with Bahrein (see paragraph 60) and which was considered suitable by Mr. Twitched in 1932. It is still uncertain how much can, in fact, be made of Ras Tanura as a steamer port or how far the project is merely a bluff. Cargoes have, however, been successfully landed there, and there were signs in the summer of serious efforts to develop the place. Accounts then given of the inner and outer anchorages were not unfavourable. A pier 100 feet long had been constructed, and a large shed had been provided ashore. Fresh water had to be brought from a distant submarine spring, but it was suggested that a better supply might be obtainable from Qatif or that artesian wells might be a possibility. It will be remembered, however, in this connexion that the idea of sinking artesian wells at Ras Tanura was pursued to some extent, but apparently without success, as long ago as 1930. In the latter part of 1933 there appeared to be a slackening of activity in the efforts to make the port. Commerce. 141. There is again very little to say about general trade, except that it was extremely slack. The Legation is now engaged on an attempt at a general review of the economic and commercial position in Saudi Arabia, and it seems preferable to reserve the subject until this can be prepared from the meagre data available. The greatest difficulty continues to be the absence of any statistical information of value. 142. One development must, however, be noted in this report. On the 10th April, 1933, it was officially announced that the Government had decided to allow cars of one type only to be used in the country, and the importation of cars33 135 (/cz) not already shipped was prohibited. This prohibition was relaxed a month later by a communique authorising individuals to import cars for their own use, but the same communique announced the conclusion of an agreement with Sharqieh (Limited), Mr. Philby’s concern, under which that company were to have a monopoly of the import of cars for Government use, and for the use of transport concerns, all of which cars, with certain exceptions, were to be Fords. Sharqieh was also to have a monopoly of the importation of tyres and accessories of all makes. Cars, &amp;c., were to be supplied to the Government and transport companies on credit terms, but 50 per cent, of the receipts of the Naqaba or Government organisation for the control of transport were to be applied to the payments. 143. This agreement, as published in an incomplete form, was in many respects obscure, but the terms agreed to by Mr. Philby were, as far as could be judged, onerous. On the 18th May he left for Egypt and England to make his financial and other arrangements. He had little success as regards cars owing to the unwillingness of the Ford Company, who are already owed money by the Government, to supply them on credit, and the difficulty of financing the purchases otherwise. 1 He made arrangements for tyres, however, with the Goodrich Company, and enlisted Polish assistance in connexion with the reorganisation of the Government workshop at Mecca, which Sharqieh had also undertaken. He eventually prevailed on Ford’s to supply a limited number of vehicles on favourable terms, but not nearly enough to satisfy the requirements of the Government, now faced with the possibility of war in the Yemen. The delay on Sharqieh’s side and their inability to produce an adequate number of cars produced a confused situation in the autumn. A concern called the Red Sea Trading Company, the prime mover in which is the King’s chauffeur, Siddiq, had a large consignment of tyres and spare parts in the Jedda customs. Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., acting for General Motors, were ready to supply Chevrolet lorries. Eventually, the Government published a notice on the 17th November which, without referring to the Sharqieh contract, had the effect of cancelling it at least temporarily, except in regard to tyres and Ford spare parts. This notice was to remain in force until the 15th April, 1934, when the Government promised a further announcement. Simultaneously with the issue of the notice the Government made a contract with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. for twenty-six Chevrolet and Bedford cars and lorries, and deposited a substantial sum on account of the purchase price. 144. It may be mentioned in this connexion that the number of motor vehicles in the country at the end of 1933 was estimated at 616 private cars, and 590 commercial vehicles. This estimate is for various reasons highly conjectural, but it gives an idea of the scale on which motor transport is used. It was stated in the Mecca press in November that there were thirty concerns engaged in the motor transport business, and that over 800 cars had been submitted to the Government transport control board for inspection. V.—'Military and Naval Organisation. 145. This section must necessarily be as jejune as usual, in the continued absence of precise information. There were in 1933 no signs of any important progress with the scheme for a regular army on European lines, some account of which has been given in previous reports. In addition to this almost negligible factor there are forces of unknown number which are regular in the sense that they are permanently employed on military service, either as slaves or wage- earners. These include the retainers of the King and his Governors and the garrison troops in important centres. The experience of 1933 has, however, made it clearer than ever that Ibn Saud must still rely mainly on levies of various kinds for any large scale military enterprise, like the threatened war with the Yemen. These can probably be classed under three distinct heads, viz., Ikhwan, the theory of whose organisation was described in paragraph 133 ff of the report for 1930; purely tribal forces; and what are called “townsmen,” i.e., men from settled centres less artificial than the Ikhwan colonies. It was thought by some that the Ikhwan had lost their old driving force and fanaticism, but they played an important part in the mobilisation at the time of the Ibn Rifada in34 1932. It is not clear how definite a line can now be drawn between them and the tribal contingents, whose response depends a great deal on the attitude of their chiefs. When making his preparations against the Yemen in the autumn of 1933, Ibn Saud had to put a good deal of pressure on certain tribes, but fear of his power and personality seems, on the whole, to have prevailed over the unwillingness of some tribes to go to a distant and dangerous front, with littl^^,,, certain prospect of the reward of loot. The townsmen are reputed to be hardy^*^ fighters, to be relied on at a pinch as rather in the nature of a final reserve. 146. Even so slight a classification can only be attempted with great diffidence. The difficulty is not that Ibn Saud’s forces have no organisation, but that the organisation is entirely different from anything familiar to European minds. It is known, for instance, to be a definite part of his system to maintain large packs of camels at suitable places where they can be fed inexpensively, but it is hard to say who are mounted on the camels, when they are required for warfare.^ No very great additions appear to have been made to armament in 1933. 1 he most definite items of information were a statement made in Bagdad by the German export manager of a firm at Bilbao that Ibn Saud, having previously bought 3,000 “Astra” automatic pistols, had in November 1932 ordered a further consignment of 10,000; and that Mr. Philby had arranged with the suppliers of the arms, &amp;c., bought in Poland in 1930 to collaborate in the reorganisation of the Government workshop in Mecca, so as to facilitate the repair of existing weapons. t 147 - It is still impossible to speak of a Saudi navy; but in 1933 the Government put into working order a large launch, the Bakura, which had been in Jedda harbour for some time and was thought to be useless; and in September they bought two more motor craft in Bahrein, similar to that mentioned in paragraph 138 of the report for 1932. Thus at the end of 1933 the Government possessed four small vessels, which, though negligible as a fleet, were quite useful for transporting moderate numbers of troops by sea to Asir. VI. —Aviation and Connected Matters. Air Force. 148. The position remained completely stationary throughout the year, as regards any effective arrangements; that is to say, the existing aircraft remained m hangars, where they have at most been kept greased, and there was no expert personnel. Reference is made in paragraph 94 to the apparent petering-out of the suggestion that the Turkish Government might help and in paragraph 77 to the more recent suggestion that France might provide an air mission. Landing-grounds on the Hasa Coast. 149. The proposals made by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in December 1932 were countered, after unimportant interludes, by a memorandum which Fuad Bey Hamza handed to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 20th June, 1933. The Saudi Government wished all landing-grounds, except one near Ras Tanura, to be on the islands, asked a yearly rental of £5,000 o-old for each and suggested that His Majesty’s Government should bear as welf all expenditure on buildings, upkeep, police and other officials, &amp;c. These were the most important conditions of a wholly unacceptable counter-proposal. It was decided to await a favourable opportunity of renewing the proposals put forward in December 1932, discretion being allowed to the Legation to offer a maximum rental of £3,000 for all facilities desired. It was recognised that it might be long before such an opportunity occurred and that, as it was imperative to maintain the Arabian air route both for civil and military purposes, accidental violations of Saudi territory were bound to occur. It was decided to meet any complaints to which such violations might give rise by offering such excuses as might be possible and appealing to the ordinary principles of humanity and civilised practice. It was agreed with the Air Ministry that measures should be taken to reduce the number of such cases to a minimum and that the Legation should be informed of them with the smallest possible delay, so as to permit of apology being made before the Saudi Government could protest. It was notto be admitted that the use of a route so close to Saudi territory as to increase the danger of occasional violations lessened the right of His Majesty’s Govern ment to expect the Saudi Government to view them leniently. Alleged Violations of Saudi Territory by British Aircraft. 150. There were, happily, very few complaints in 1933 of flying over or landing without the permission of the Saudi Government. It had to be admitted in January that an Imperial Airways machine had lost its way in the previous November and flown over Jubayl to get bearings. Two new complaints of flying over in the same area were made in February, but proved to have no foundation. An important case occurred on the 31st March when the Imperial Airways liner Hanno made a forced landing at Jubayl. In this case it was possible to notify the Saudi Government the same evening. The local authorities were most helpful and, although the Minister for Foreign Affairs embodied a protest in his reply to a note from the Legation, it was of the mildest possible description. The only other case that arose was on the 24th July, when a Royal Air Force flying-boat was forced by engine trouble to land on the coast close to Jinna Island and immediate relief had to be sent by air, in addition to which H.M.S. Bideford proceeded to the spot. In this case also prompt notice was given to the Saudi Government, although their permission for the visit of the relief and the warship was not awaited. They made no protest on this occasion, preferring to confine themselves to an expression of regret that the incident should have occurred and of solicitude for the flying-boat and its crew. 151. Thus the balance sheet for the year was satisfactory, both as regards the number of incidents and the attitude of the Saudi Government. Their reaction demonstrates the advantage of explaining and apologising for unavoid able trespasses at the earliest possible moment; but it must not be assumed that they will always be so gentle. Their complaisance in July was almost certainly due to Ibn Saud’s anxiety at the time to enlist the sympathy of His Majesty’s Government in his grievance against the Imam Yahya. 152. There were no complaints during the year of aircraft crossing the Transjordan frontier, as to which the Saudi Government are even more sensitive than they are about the Hasa coast. VII.— Legislation. 153. No progress seems to have been made in 1933 with the task of co-ordinating the confused mass of Saudi legislation. It is still difficult in a country where no law in the European sense can be enacted, because the Prophet legislated for all time, and in which there is no official gazette, to keep track of the various acts which may be regarded as legislative. Nevertheless, there has of late been rather more method in the promulgation of such acts, if only because they more frequently form the subject of “high decrees ” and because official communiques, which are often quite important in this connexion, are numbered and dated. 154. The output of legislation of any kind seems, however, to have been small in 1933, apart from enactments relative to matters already mentioned, like the designation of the heir apparent, the Transjordan treaty settlement, the customs tariff and concessions and connected matters. The regulation on rents for the year ending the 25th April, 1933, was renewed with one modification for the succeeding year. Certain existing regulations were amended, e.g., that on fire-arms, which was tightened up, and the regulation regarding the committee to deal with the pilgrimage. 155. Two or three regulations on police and judicial matters were of mainly local interest. The following regulations of more general interest are worth enumerating :— (a) Two communiques of the 21st May and the 7th July dealt with the annulment of old papers of Saudi nationality and the adoption of a new form of Saudi passport.36 (b) A “ high decree ” of the 28th July dealt with the creation of a Board of Education. (r) A communique of the 9th June laid down rules regarding the practice of medicine and allied avocations by private doctors, &amp;c. 156. The regulations at (a) in the preceding paragraph had more to do with the unification of Ibn Baud’s dominions in 1932 than with the drive against* certain categories of foreigners, which will be described in paragraph 179 below, but both may be regarded as parts of a scheme, not unreasonable if it were carried out rationally and without undue hardship, for clarifying the position in regard to the many nondescripts who abound in Saudi Arabia. The regulations at (c) were liberally conceived, but gave rise to some anxiety in the British Legation lest they should be a prelude to efforts to bring the Government of India dispensaries under the control of the Saudi Director-General of Public Health, who has more than once shown signs of longing to have them, or at least the Mecca branch, under his thumb. 157. In a note dated the 13th July, the Saudi Government claimed the right to adhere to the definition of territorial waters adopted in the regulation mentioned in paragraph 150 (/) of the report for 1932. The Legation safeguarded the position of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in a reply dated the 15th July, and the Secretary of State did not consider it necessary to pursue the matter further. VIII.— Press. 158. Practically nothing need be added to what was said in paragraphs 152 and 153 of the report for 1932. The weekly Umm-al-Qura continued to be conducted on the same lines during 1933, and was the effective organ of the Saudi Government for most purposes. The Saut-al-Hijaz survived as a blameless second fiddle. 159. Events in Saudi Arabia attract some attention in Arab countries, and some papers, in Egypt especially, get more or less regular correspondence from the Hejaz. Nothing that happened in 1933 was of sufficient interest in western circles to draw any European foreign correspondents to the country, although the affaire d'Andhurin (paragraph 76) and the Saudi-Yemen imbroglio proved to have some slight news value. Reuters telegraphed “ Unrequire ” to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., when they asked whether to report on the negotiations in Jedda for a Saudi—Transjordan settlement, but reproached them for not telling the world that Mme. d’Andhurin had been hanged in Mecca, when that rumour was circulated by some enterprising newsmonger. Mr. Philby resumed his connexion with the Near East and India at the end of the year, although his first news-letter did not appear until the number of the 4th January, 1934. IX. —Education. 160. Members of the Legation staff have endeavoured to collect information regarding this little known subject. The results of their enquiries are worth summarising, but, in the absence of official information, they can only be given very tentatively. Broadly speaking, the main conclusions are as follows : {a) The Saudi Government appear to have preserved to a large extent in the Hejaz the old Turkish system of primary and secondary schools with certain additions. (b) There are in Mecca, Jedda and Medina a certain number of private schools, some of which are important and with which the Government do not interfere unduly, although they are inspected, (c) The educational system is dominated by the importance attached to religious studies, but purely Wahhabi teaching is not insisted on in all cases, and a certain amount of secular instruction is imparted. (d) Very moderate numbers of students have been sent abroad in past years under Government or private auspices, but the impoverishment of the treasury and of private benefactors has reduced the number to a very low ebb. (e) There is no provision for female education in schools, girls being left to get what they can from private tuition in their houses or from mistresses teaching the Koran, some Arabic and some needlework in their own houses. (/) There is no evidence of an organised educational system in Nejd, where the chief means of instruction is said to be that afforded by mullahs teaching in the mosques.37 161. The data on which conclusions (a) to (d) above are based may be summed up as follows, with reference to the various centres :— Mecca. The Government maintain the following schools : (1) The Mahad-al-Saudi or Saudi Institute, a centre of higher education for the training of teachers. Founded in 1928. Four years’ course, largely secular. Legal studies provided for in 1933. English compulsory. Thirty-five students and six teachers. (2) The Madrassat-al-Hadith, founded in 1933. Devoted to the teaching of the traditions of the Prophet. Twenty students and four teachers. Directed by an Egyptian Imam. (3) The Madrassat-al-Ibtidaiyya, founded in 1924. Said, in spite of its name, to give a secondary education. Four years’ course, largely secular. English compulsory. Four hundred students and twenty teachers. (4) Three primary schools in different quarters. Teaching of the Koran, reading and writing. Nine hundred boys and thirty teachers in all. The three principal private schools are these : (1) Madrassat-as-Soulitiyya, run by Indian Moslems in a fine building of its own, with a boarding house and primary school attached. Founded by a well-known Indian divine, Maulana Rahmatullah, over fifty years ago. Well endowed. Imparts both religious and secular instruction. Full course takes twelve years. Seven hundred and thirty-four students of many different races and forty teachers. (2) Madrassat- al-Falah. Founded in 1904* by Muhammad Ali Zeynal Ali Ridha, a member of the well-known family of Persian origin, to which the late Governor of Jedda belonged. Religious and secular education. Eight hundred students and thirty-four teachers. English formerly compulsory, now optional. (3) There are four less important schools run by natives or Indians and giving elementary education to about 600 pupils. There is one Javanese primary school giving religious education to about fifty pupils. There is a considerable frequentation by Javanese and Malayans of individual preachers and teachers at the Haram and elsewhere. Jedda. The Government maintain a secondary and a primary school similar to those at Mecca, but catering for not more than 200 pupils with some ten teachers. The principal educational establishment is the Madrassat-al-Falah, part of the foundation of the same name at Mecca and run on the same lines with an eight years’ course. There are about 700 pupils and twenty-four teachers. Medina. The Government maintain a secondary and a primary school, which cater for about 600 pupils with about nineteen teachers. The most important educational establishment is, however, a private one called the Madrassat-al- Ulum-al-Shariyya, founded in 1922. It is run by an Indian divine and supported by Indian benevolence. This gives secular, as well as religious, education and has industrial classes. There are about 250 pupils and twenty teachers. An orphanage, accommodating about 100 boys, was founded by a resident Indian merchant in 1933. This provides religious, secular and industrial training. Taif, Yambu, Wejh, Qunfidha, &amp;c. The Government maintain secondary and primary schools at Taif and primary schools in the other smaller towns. In them, as in Mecca, Jedda and Medina, there would appear to be a good deal of miscellaneous teaching in mosques and in the private houses of teachers. Students Abroad. Information under this head is not very easy to collect. As regards persons sent abroad by the Government, the principal informant supplies the names of four students, who were sent to Palestine some years ago and whom he identifies with the four who went to the Marconi school at Chelmsford in 1931 to learn wireless work; three doctors who were sent to Paris, and two only of whom are now in Saudi Arabia, the third having absconded after his return; two doctors who were sent to Egypt and one of whom has stayed on to continue his studies at his own expense; one engineer, who was sent to Istanbul and is now attached to38 the Jedda municipality; and thirty-two lads, sent to Egypt at different times for miscellaneous studies. The Saudi Government is stated to have rented a house for the last named, but would appear to have discontinued this on grounds of expense. Besides these official students, mention is made of two parties sent to India by private benefactors. The larger number were sent some four years ago to Bombay by the Muhammad Ali Zeynal Ali Ridha already mentioned. Practically all of these have recently returned. A small party of four, who went to India in 1933 under the auspices of a Calcutta merchant, seem also to have returned already. There would thus appear to be no Saudi students abroad at the present time, with the exception of a very few sent by their families to be educated abroad. One of these is at the Victoria College in Alexandria. The total number probably does not exceed three or four. 162. The board constituted under the decree mentioned in paragraph 155 (b) above was composed of the Acting Director of Education, who is also the head of the Saudi Institute, and four other persons. The Saudi Minister in London is said still to hold in theory the post of Director of Education. It is clear from the above account, if it is even approximately accurate, that the facilities for modern education in the Hejaz are not negligible. Nevertheless, the provision of higher education in other than religious subjects and its quality seem inadequate to provide Saudi Arabia with a modern minded intelligentsia, or a sufficient supply of capable officials to replace those of alien Arab birth now so lare^eH employed in the key positions. X.—The Pilgrimage. 163. The length of preceding section makes it desirable to curtail this and to refer interested readers to the full report on the pilgrimage of 1933, submitted at the end of July. The most salient feature was a still further falling off in the total number of overseas pilgrims as shown by the following table *— Nationality. 1932. 1933. British and British administered- Indian 9,634 7,093 Malayan ... 80 101 West African 780 509 Sudanese ... 527 420 Palestinian 1,352 240 Dutch East Indian ... 4,375 2,316 Egyptian ... 2,312 1,698 Others, including minor British elements ... 10,005 8,328 29,065 20,705 It may be noted that these figures are only for arrivals at Jedda and Yambu, and do not, therefore, include numerous pilgrims who land from dhows on the southern coast, and who have been the subject of some controversy between the British and Italian authorities. It may also be noted that the Indian figure is for British Indians and that a much greater number of pilgrims, 10,920 in 1933 embark at Indian ports, Afghans in particular having greatly increased in the recent years of general decline. u on T ues day, the 4th April. There were probably about 50,000 in all who stood on Arafat” that day. The general conditions ol the pilgrimage were very similar to those of 1932. Climatic and sanitary conditions were again good, and no authority had any difficulty in pronouncing the returning pilgrimage to be clean. Security was as well maintained as usual m area of the Ilejaz. This is still Ibn Saud s greatest contribution to the welfare of pilgrims, but there were definite, if small, signs of improvement m arrangements in 1933, and there was greater tolerance in the treat- ment of foreign pilgrims. The question of the tariff, which had caused so much i noo U in dealt with in a businesslike fashion in anticipation of the 1 i Primage. The pilgrim, using transport other than his two feet, is heavily mulcted, but there was no ground of controversy between His Majesty’s Govern ment in the United Kingdom and the Saudi Government.165. Perhaps the most exotic of the more notable pilgrims in 1933 were the Amir of Katsina and Lady Evelyn Cobbold. The former, a great lord m Nigeria, brought a considerable posse of wives, children and other followers some ot whom he took on to England. The latter was allowed to go to the holy cities on the strength of having embraced Islam nearly sixty years before, although in the interval she had had less practical experience of the faith than of the duties ot an English wife and mother and the pleasures of a great lady. It was said by the malicious that the King swallowed her Islam the more easily because she had a son-in-law on the Board of the Bank of England. 166. It is worth recording that Sir G. Buchanan, who, as Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health, is much concerned with international sanitary questions, including those connected with the pilgrimage, visited Jedda privately in January. XI.— Slavery and the Slave Trade. 167. This section can also be curtailed, as the Legation is preparing a special report which will bring the whole subject up to date. No major question arose in 1933. The Legation continued to exercise the right of manumission normally without encountering any undue opposition on the part of the Saudi authorities. The number of slaves dealt with were as follows On hand at the beginning of January : 2 males. Took refuge during the year : 17 males, 3 females. Manumitted and repatriated : 17 males, 2 females. Locally manumitted : 1 female. Left the Legation voluntarily after taking refuge : 1 male. On hand at the end of December : 1 male. 168. The Legation investigated the alleged sale by an Abyssinian pilgrim of a woman whom he had brought to the Hejaz, ostensibly as his wife The facts could not be ascertained with sufficient certainty to justify representations to the Saudi Government. Representations were made in another case in which a man in Kamaran alleged that his two children had been re-enslaved, not far trom Jedda after he and they had been manumitted by a former owner. Although he produced a document purporting to be a certificate of manumission, the Saudi Government claimed to have established by careful enquiry that he was a runaway, whose son had been sold and whose daughter had been married and manumitted. It was not found possible to pursue the case for lack of furthei evidence. 169. One unusual case is worth mentioning as an illustration of the need for care in manumission cases. Two girls who took refuge m the Legation pretending to be slaves, were proved conclusively to be free members of a local family, who had naughtily run away from home. 170. Reference is made in paragraph 72 to the possibility that the Saudi Government may seek in 1934 to reopen the question of their position His Majesty’s Government in regard to slavery. It is possible that they will attempt to rid themselves of the Legation manumission system even it they do not attempt to obtain the abrogation of article 7 of the Ireaty of Jedda. XII.— Naval Matters. 171. His Majesty’s sloops in the Red Sea visited Jedda as follows in 1933 . Hastings, January 13 to 15; Penzance, April 1 to 8; Hastings, July 6 to 9; Penzance, November 18 to 23. The visit in April was that normally made at pilgrimage time, and the usual Haj Regatta was held on the 6th April. BigM Moslem ratings made the pilgrimage in accordance with what has become an annual custom. 172. The only other naval visits during the year were those of the French naval yacht Diana with Vice-Admiral Jubert on board from the 3!st January to the 2nd February; the Italian cruiser Libia from the 6th to the 8th May, the French despatch boat Ypres from the 28th to the 29th October.40 173. Further purchases of motor dhows by the Saudi Government are recorded in paragraph 146. These craft have proved useful for military transport despite their insignificant appearance, each being able to carry, it is said, as many as 200 men or more, as well as supplies. 174. I he proceedings of H.M.S. Penzance in March 1933 included a visit to the Farsan .Islands, made with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Minister, who had consulted the Foreign Office, but had misconstrued their agreement as meaning that the visit should be made without previous notification to the Saudi Govern ment, whereas it was understood in London that there would be such a notification, though not a request for permission. The immediate result was that, when the sloop reached the islands, both the Sheikh of Little Farsan and the Saudi Governor of Great Farsan objected, not discourteously, but firmly. So far as the Saudi Government were concerned, the matter was disposed of in friendly conversation between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey Hamza on the 1st April/ The ensuing correspondence with His Majesty’s Government clarified a situation which had been obscure, though not really indefinite, since 1931. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom based themselves on their strongly held principle that Asir had passed, de facto and de jure, under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud and that the Farsan Islands are an integral part of Asir. They reaffirmed a standing ruling that His Majesty’s ships should not, until further notice, visit Hejazi or Asir ports, other than Jedda, except in cases of urgent necessity, and that, even in such cases, His Majesty’s representative in Jedda should be consulted before hand and the Saudi Government notified. In particular, visits to the Farsan islands should for the time being be avoided and, if special circumstances should render any such visit highly desirable, the matter should be referred in the first instance to the Secretary of State. It was recognised that there was no longer any logical basis for a distinction between Asir and the rest of Saudi Arabia, as regards the searching of dhows by His Majesty’s ships in territorial waters, but it was decided, for reasons connected with the slave trade, to maintain in this respect the standing instructions mentioned in paragraph 200 (b) of the report for 1931, which permit a greater freedom of search in Asiri waters than in those of the Hejaz. 175. It was clear from the conversation between Fuad Bey Hamza and Sir Andrew Ryan on the 1st April that the Saudi Government were very much alive to the distinction between naval visits by notification and visits made with the express permission of the Government of the country visited. Fuad Bey intimated that they were studying the whole subject and that they were contemplating the adoption of regulations which should be in accordance with international practice. He did not indicate with any precision what view they were likely to take and nothing further passed on the subject up to the end of the year. 176. It may be mentioned that any final decision on this subject may affect islands less conspicuously placed than the Farsans. Sloops have in the past visited an island called Ashik, off the coast between the Wadi Taashar and Medi, the status of which may depend on the exact line of the frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. No question has hitherto arisen regarding this isolated place and His Majesty’s Government have left in abeyance one which arose in 1933 regarding a proposal (which would have necessitated cruising and anchoring in Farsan waters) that a sloop should examine, for hydrographical purposes, a shoal containing the islands of Jaferi and Kadheiya, about 5 miles south of Jizan. XIII.—Miscellaneous Matters of British Interest. General Position of British Subjects. 177. European British subjects had even less reason in 1933 than before to complain of their treatment by the Saudi authorities. Although certain local laws are vexatious, like the prohibition of alcohol, music, &amp;c., and the passport regulations, the restrictions as a whole weighed very lightly on them. There are few houses which cannot run to cocktails quand meme; the police turn a deaf ear to the gramophones; one unofficial British subject has an unconcealed wireless set; there is no interference with such simple games and sport as Jedda affords;41 and private cinema performances have been added to the resources of Europeans. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that in a country where nearly everything is prohibited except marriage and slavery, they are about the only means of enjoyment of which the European British subject in Jedda avails himself very little in the case of the first and not at all in the case of the second. Moslem residents of a respectable class seem to be also well treated and in 1933 there was little persecution of pilgrims on religious grounds. The only serious ground of complaint was the attitude observed toAvards certain classes of British subjects who are neither permanently resident nor pilgrims making a short stay. This is dealt with in paragraph 179 below. Deportations. 178. Two British subjects deported in 1932 were allowed to return in 1933, an Indian who had mixed himself up with a fanatical agitator and had been deported with him, and a Nigerian, Avho had been deported on a charge of making illicit drink. The number of new cases of deportation and expulsion which came to the notice of the Legation was very small and, though they presented certain features of hardship, they were not important enough to deserve mention in detail. No opportunity arose of attempting to arrive at a general understanding with the Saudi Government of the kind indicated in paragraph 175 of the report for 1932. It is doubtful whether such an understanding Avould be of much practical value and it would be difficult to negotiate it in view of the tendency of the Saudi Government to regard deportation as an easy means of dumping persons they dislike anywhere outside their territory, but to raise objections on the few occasions when they are asked to accept Saudi subjects of whom other authorities wish to be quit. Nationality. 179. Agitation was caused in June, especially in British African circles in Mecca and Jedda, bv various acti\ 7 ities of the ►baudi authorities, the exact natuie of which it was difficult to determine owing to the methods employed, but which appeared to aim at reducing the semi-settled foreign population by forcing them to leave the country, by forcing such as might be allowed to remain to accept Saudi nationality, by enlisting some for military service and by insisting that only Saudi subjects‘should be employed as chauffeurs by the Government and transport companies. As a result of strong representations by the Legation under the first three heads, the following position may be said to have been reached, although the question simmered rather than was settled :— {a) The Saudi Government desisted from threats of general expulsion, which had undoubtedly been used by certain authorities towards British Africans and denied that any pressure was being used to impose Saudi nationality. Fuad Bey'told Sir Andrew Ryan orally that the commission appointed in 1932 to consider the position legal ding persons claiming foreign nationality was continuing its labouis. (b) Efforts were made to convince the Legation that the only definite measure taken was one aimed at mendicants and persons without fixed employ ment. In support of this, a belated communique Avas issued on the 10th July to the effect that the thievery, moral corruption and uncleanliness caused throughout the country, and especially in the holy precincts at Mecca, by African natives and certain T emenis, whether Saudi or foreign subjects, had decided the GoA 7 ernment to require persons with no fixed means of support to return to their homes. All this is not known to have made much difference. ToAvards the end of the year Africans were again coming over from Massawa to the Asir coast and footing it to Mecca. Although the Saudi authorities have turned back at least one dhow, some of its passengers landed on the coast a little way off. (c) It was denied that foreigners had been enlisted for military service. So manv people have no papers that it would be hard to say whether the denial was made in good faith or not, but there has at any rate been no large-scale enlistment of British subjects since the matter was taken up with the Saudi Government.42 (d) The question of chauffeurs is more delicate, as it cannot on principle be claimed that British subjects have a right to exercise any profession in Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, there are no published regulations, and sudden refusals to renew licences in favour of foreigners unwilling to accept Saudi nationality create hardship, aggravated in some cases by the fact that the persons concerned have claims against the Government, Government-controlled companies and other transporters for arrears of wages. The Government stated officially to the Legation in July that they could not employ foreigners in cars used for military purposes. Up to the end of the year the question dragged on confusedly, the Legation being unable to take any strong line, while the Government oscillated between sporadic attempts to enforce their rules and the temptation to employ foreigners all the same, owing to the demand for transport in connexion with military preparations against the Yemen. This question affects a wider range of persons than Africans, as Asiatics also, including Indians and Malays, make their living as chauffeurs. Clerical Visits. 180. Two offers by clergymen of the Church of England to visit Jedda to minister to the needs of the British community caused His Majesty’s Minister to enquire of Fuad Bey Hamza in July what the attitude of the Saudi Government would be if a British clergyman wished to come to Jedda occasionally to hold a service in the Legation. The reply was categorical. Fuad Bey said that no non- Moslem minister of religion could be admitted to the Hejaz in any circumstances; not even as an ordinary traveller not intending to act in a clerical capacity. His Majesty’s Government held that this attitude, however lamentable, could not be contested. The firmness with which it is held by the Saudi Government is proved by an article in the Tablet of the 6th January, 1934. describing how a priest on board a visiting ship was refused permission to land. Incidentally, the ship, according to the Tablet, would appear to have groped its way into the Jedda roads in the utmost ignorance as to the waters it was approaching. It could easily have had a pilot from the shore. Only sky-pilots are barred. AlFadhl (Alfazal) Case. 181. Some account of this case was given in paragraph 215 of the report for 1931 and paragraph 178 of that for 1932. The difficulty in placing the books of the firms in India at the disposal of the Saudi Liquidation Commission having been overcome, and a representative of the Imperial Bank of Persia having spent quite a long time in Jedda, the commission reported in April 1933. Up to the end of the year, however, the Saudi Government had not announced any decision. European Cemetery in Jedda. 182. A certain amount was done in 1933 to carry out the programme outlined in paragraph 202 of the report for 1930. The British Legation remained in charge. The wall and the caretaker’s hovel were to some extent repaired, and the enclosure was cleaned up in July. A plan was drawn up and a fair amount of material was collected for a historical record which it is hoped to complete in 1934. The Legation records with gratitude its appreciation of the sympathetic help received from the Imperial War Graves Commission and its representatives in Egypt. The commission reproduced the plan and gave material assistance in the effort to put together the meagre information regarding the past of the cemetery. Its representatives in Egypt have interested themselves in a scheme for a very modest plantation to relieve the lamentable bareness of the cemetery. It will never be anything but a place of desolation, but, if the present efforts are sustained, it will cease to be a disgrace to Europe in the East. Bibliography. 183. Three books of importance in connexion with Saudi Arabia were published in 1933, viz., Mr. Philby's The Empty Quarter, describing his expedition to the Rub-al-Khali in 1932; Mr. Kenneth Williams’s Ibn Saud; and43 a work in Arabic, by Fuad Bey Hamza, named, not very originally, The Heart of the Arabian Peninsula. Another work on Ibn Saud is projected by Captain F. H. C. Armstrong, the author of Grey Wolf. He devoted much time in 1933 to preparatory work, and arrived in Jedda on the 31st May to see the King. The latter gave him an intensive series of five long audiences in two and a half days. Captain Armstrong’s style is now well known; his method is to put innumerable questions. He addressed many to the King himself, who seems to have been singularly forthcoming with tales of love and war, and he has simply bombarded Fuad Bey Hamza and the Saudi Minister in London. The picture he produces may be distorted, but it should be interesting and certainly more complimentary than Grey Wolf. Another work is promised by Lady Evelyn Cobbold (see paragraph 165). o6864 [8544] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Printed for the use of the Foreign Office.

THE new title of this report embodies the new name given by Ibn Sand to his dominions by a decree of the 18th September, 1932. \ielding, it was said, to the pressing solicitations of his people, he decided that what had been the Kingdom of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies' should be known^fc “ the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ” as from the 22nd September, the date of ^e autumnal equinox. The circumstances in which the decision was taken will be described later. For the moment it is enough to say that the promoters of this “blessed movement,' as the inspired Mecca Umm-al-Qura newspaper called it, aimed at substituting for a mere geographical description a name which should emphasise the essentially Arab character of the State and its inhabitants, and should commemorate the King’s part in creating a united country; under his powerful and benehcent rule. There were indications that some of the promoters had in mind the ideal of a union of all Arabs, but they were vague and discreet enough not to conflict with the King’s own profession that he respects the position of other iVrab rulers, provided they do their duty as good Arabs and Moslems. The immediate purpose, and the only definite purpose, was to affirm the united character of the congeries of territories which he has collected since 1901. The change consummated the gradual reversal of the programme of 1926, when he represented himself as having conquered the Hejaz only to purge it of unworthy rulers, and as intending to hold it in trust, as it were, for its inhabitants and for the Moslem world. In 1926 it was to have its own Constitution, and was to pay stated allowances to the King in respect of services to be rendered. In 1932 it became part of a single kingdom, which, subject to the transitional maintenance of present arrangements, was to be endowed with a new Constitution extending to the whole and to be further consolidated by the establishment of a rule of succession to the throne. The adoption of the new title had one other important effect. It implied, without expressly asserting, the completeness of the merger of A sir in the King’s dominions, as a result of the arrangements made with the Idrisi in 1931. 2. In order to avoid confusion and cumbrousness the word “ Saudi ’’ will be used throughout this report to describe the country, the Government, &amp;c., although it did not properly become applicable until late in the year. 3. An attempt was made in the annual report for 1930 to analyse Ibn Baud’s position and prospects as an empire-builder and as a factor in the international system. The report for 1931 indicated the dangers which appeared to menace his internal position and the extent of his isolation in the modern world. “ He has become,” it was said, “ a lonely and somewhat tragic figure holding his own with difficulty in a situation, the worst immediate feature of which ^ is an impoverishment due largely to world causes beyond his control and almost beyond his comprehension.” Throughout 1932 his country continued to be impoverished, but the King appeared to command resources sufficient to finance all necessary measures to cope with attempts to undermine him. His isolation was less pronounced. He demonstrated his strength in a way which did much to re-estab lish his prestige in Arabia and further afield. If it be true, as it probably is, that he conceives himself to be a man with a divine mission, he could point to much which seemed to indicate the determination of Allah to see him through; the determination of an Arab Allah, no alien God. His position at the end of the year was still far from secure, but it was, in spite of the growing hopelessness of tte financial outlook, more solid than it had appeared twelve months before. 4. The King showed no signs during the year of losing his personal grip. In the spring there were unfavourable reports of his physical state, but when His Majesty’s Minister saw him at the end of August he looked very fit. He still controls all his advisers, and displayed considerable skill in 1932 as an equilibrist among them. Thus he reinstated and promoted his Finance Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, despite his apparent surrender in October 1931 to that gentleman’s enemies; but he allowed the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza, the most conspicuous members of the opposing group, to go on a spectacular mission to Europe, and he retains Fuad Bey as his effective Minister for Foreign Affairs through thick and thin. His relations with the Amir Feisal are obscure. Father and son are not supposed to see eye to eye, but if the King ever had the intention[8544] b 2 3 attributed to him in the spring of keeping the Amir at Riyadh on his return from Egypt he did not adhere to it. At that time he indeed deferred to the Amir’s representations on behalf of citizens of Mecca and Jedda who had been deported to Riyadh. Even less is known of his relations with his eldest surviving son, the Amir Saud, who resides permanently in Nejd. Early in the year there was a story that the King intended to designate Feisal as his successor. It was --- ^derstood in the autumn, after the unification of Saudi Arabia, that the choice nad fallen on Saud. The King is again an equilibrist in dealing with religious extremists. He defers to them when his material interests are not affected, and permits periodical intensifications of the activities of the Committees of Virtue, which in October 1932, for instance, raged in a manner that the Amir Feisal himself could not combat; but in important matters affecting general policy or his schemes for developing the country, Ibn Saud imposes his will on the Ulema of Nejd. 5. The year was one of stagnation as regards many questions dealt with in great detail in the report for 1931. On the other hand, it was marked by events of considerable importance relatively to the Arabian stage. As they had repercussions on most important matters to be discussed in separate sections of the present report, it will help to an understanding of these to complete this introduction by a summary account of the events in question. 6. Friendship, or at least the appearance of friendship, with Great Britain is a cardinal factor in Ibn Baud’s policy. Much of his ascendency in the Arab ? world depends on the widespread belief that he enjoys British support./ Nevertheless, he allowed his relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to be seriously strained about the end of January 1932 by a quarrel over a slave who had taken refuge in the Legation at Jedda during the previous month. The details of this affair will be dealt with later. It is enough to say here that the incident was happily liquidated in April and the way cleared for the inclusion of London in the tour of the mission, presided over by the Amir Feisal, which the King sent forth to visit friendly capitals in Europe and the nearer parts of Asia. 7. While the mission was improving Ibn Baud’s contact with the outer world, he was assailed by a sudden danger at home. One Hamid-bin-Rifada, one of a leading family in the Billi tribe, with an urban establishment at Wejh, had been floating about as an exile in Egypt, Palestine and Transjordan since the failure of a local rising at Wejh in 1929. On the night of the 20th-21st May, 1932, this man entered the Hejaz near Aqaba with a rebel band which he had recruited in Egypt and elsewhere. Although the Saudi Government had known of his activities, they did not get news of his actual invasion until it was conveyed to them by His Majesty’s Legation on the 30th May. Ibn Saud could not tell what it portended. The' rebel force was small, but it might attract support in the Hejaz and any success there might be the signal for revolt elsewhere. Portions of the Shammar tribes were of dubious loyalty. In Eastern Nejd the Mutair and Ajman still smarted under the after-effects of their rebellion in 1929. There might be doubts of the loyalty of the tribes in the Taif region. It had been necessary to send a punitive force some months before to quell disorder in Najran on the northern confines of Asir. Asir itself was uneasy under the new Saudi yoke. The King was conscious of political activities in the background of Ibn Rifada’s enterprise and other possible enterprises. He believed his enemy, the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, to be the head centre of all attempts to undermine his own position. He may at first have shared the belief, then and later held widely in Nejd and to some extent elsewhere, that the British were stimulating the forces hostile to him. 8. Ibn Saud called out the famous Ikhwan. They responded in large' numbers, flocking to A1 Ula and to Taif, where the King remained in summer residence, keeping an eye on every side. The Ikhwan were loud in their loyalty. They complained only of being used for so small an affair as that of Ibn Rifada and of not being allowed to carry on the Holy War, which was duly proclaimed, against the real enemy, Abdullah and his fellow “ hypocrites,” an epithet which recalled the struggles' of the Prophet against hidden adversaries. On the other hand, measures taken by the British authorities in Transjordan and by the Egyptian Government at the instance of His Majesty's Government cut off4 Ibn Rifada from any hope of reinforcements or supplies from outside. He got little local support either. Such as it was, it dwindled when it was seen how little food or money he had to offer. A party of Beni Atiya escaped British control in Transjordan and got over the frontier further east in June, but it amounted to little more than a brigand band. Ibn Rifada himself had no qualities of leadership and no means of making a swift push forward. He hung about undl the 30th July, when he and the main body of his followers were killed off in t 1 ^** neighbourhood of Muwaila by the Ikhwan and other Saudi forces. The latter then proceeded to exterminate such of the remnants as could not escape into Transjordan or join up with the vagabond band of Beni Atiya. No other disaffected element in Saudi Arabia rose at that time. 9. Ibn Rifada had had attaches in Transjordan as well as in Egypt. It has never been formally proved that the Amir Abdullah was privy to his attempt, and, indeed, the Amir disavowed it under British pressure. Definite suspicion attaches to members of the Amir’s entourage, though it would be hard to convict them in a court of law. An important role was also played by a body called the Hizb-al-Ahrar-al-Hijazi, or group of Hejazi Liberals, which had existed for several years and had come into close association with exponents of the cause of a Hashimite restoration in the Hejaz. This organisation has branches in Egypt and the Yemen as well as in Transjordan, and has connexions elsewhere, notably in the Italian colony of Eritrea. It is composed largely of expatriated members of Hejazi town families, notably the Dabbaghs, two of whom, Hussein and Tahir, are the most active spirits. It'is certain that these people projected a rising in Asir to synchronise with and somewhat precede Ibn Rifada’s adventure. This rising did not come off in May, but it broke out independently early in November. Hasan-al-Idrisi, who had accepted the practical annexation of his country by Ibn Saud in 1931, but retained a simulacrum of authority, put himself at the head of the new rebellion. Ibn Saud took this movement very seriously and sent considerable forces to Asir. The course of the affair will be described later. The important point to note in a general review is its close connexion with the Ibn Rifada business, despite the failure of the outside promoters to make them synchronise according to plan. II. —Foreign Relations. (A) With States in Arabia. Iraq. 10. The relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq were correct throughout the year and improved as it wore on. Although disputes arose between the two Governments, they were fewer in number than might have been expected. In the second half of the year it became the fashion in high Saudi circles and the press to acclaim King Feisal as a sound Arab and a ruler with whom it was possible to get on, in contrast with his brother, the Amir of Transjordan. Great care was taken on the Saudi side not to connect the King of Iraq or his Government in any way with the Ibn Rifada affair or other onslaughts on Ibn Saud. The latter sent a cordial telegram of congratulation to King Feisal on the admittance of Iraq to the League of Nations in October. 11. The benevolent attitude of Ibn Saud and his Government towards Iraq and King Feisal did not extend to the eldest brother, ex-King Ali, and persons supposed to belong to his especial circle. His journey to Amman on the 23rd June to make a long stay with the Amir Abdullah aroused violent suspicion, and there was an almost simultaneous scare over an alleged plot in his entourage to assassinate the Amir Feisal during the visit of the Saudi mission to Bagdad. These were, however, transitory emotions. Good sense prevailed, and during the remainder of the year the Saudi Government kept off the subject of the ex-King. 12. Dr. Naji-al-Asil, the first Iraqi Charge d’Affaires and consul-general, arrived in Jedda on the 14th February. Although an Iraqi, he had been at one time closely associated with King Hussein, whom he served as a sort of diplomatic representative in Europe in and after 1922. His general reputation in British circles at that time was not high, but, on his arrival in the Hejaz, he made a favourable impression on His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires. Whatever[8544] b 3 his character or qualifications, he was suspect in the eyes of the Saudi Govern ment. These suspicions came to a head at the time of the Ibn Rifada affair, when the Acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs accused him by name, in confidential conversation with Sir Andrew Ryan, of being an accomplice in the general plot against Ibn Saud, which lay behind the invasion of Ibn Rifada. He was recalled to Bagdad early in June, and left Jedda on the 11th June. There 'as no reason to read into this more than a desire on the part of his Government to consult him on outstanding questions and to have him at hand for the visit of the Amir Feisal’s mission. It was, however, arranged, during or soon after that visit, that a new Charge d’Affaires should be appointed. Colonel Reshid Bey-al-Khoja, the Iraqi consul-general at Beirut, was chosen to succeed Dr. Naji. He did not, however, proceed to Jedda, and was eventually given a portfolio in the new Cabinet formed in Iraq in November. From the date of Dr. Naji’s departure up to the end of the year the Iraqi Legation was run by subordinates, some of whom are also supposed to be tarred with the Hashimite brush, but who have carried on discreetly. Rushaid Pasha, the Saudi Charge d’Affaires and consul-general designate at Bagdad, has never proceeded to his post and seems to be never heard of. 13. The chief event of Dr. Naji’s short tenure of office was the exchange of ratifications of the treaties negotiated by Nuri Pasha in April 1931. This took place at Mecca on the 10th May. The most important other matters which arose between Iraq and Saudi Arabia in 1932 were the following :— (i) Nuri Pasha was most anxious that the Iraqi Legation should be established at Mecca, and believed in his breezy way that he had obtained the assent of the Saudi Government to this. Dr. Naji was accordingly appointed to Mecca, but Ibn Saud would have none of it. The controversy over this was acute, and helped to make Dr. Naji’s position even more difficult than it would in any case have been. He increased the suspicions of the Saudi Government by expressing a wish to take a house at Taif and by visiting Medina just after Ibn Rifada had invaded the Hejaz. He visited the King at Taif on the 8th June, and made a last unsuccessful attempt to get his consent to a Legation at Mecca. The question was finally settled during the Amir Feisal’s visit to Bagdad, when it was agreed that the Legation should be at Jedda, but that the Iraqi representative should have access to Mecca. (ii) In February a Saudi force went to Judaidat-al-Arar, on the Iraqi-Nejd frontier, and claimed the right to levy taxes on the tribes in the vicinity. It withdrew on the appearance of Iraqi desert police cars, but the Nejdis reappeared in March and reasserted the claim to levy taxes. The place is so marginal that the well which gives it its importance may be bisected by the frontier. The Iraqi Government decided not to maintain the territorial claim, which they were at first inclined to advance, but they objected to any taxation of Iraqi tribes, and invoked an article in the Uqair protocols prohibiting the military use by either side of watering places on the frontier. The dispute was still being pursued in June, but, as nothing has been heard of it in British circles since, it would appear to have fizzled out as a practical question. (iii) Nuri Pasha was very keen on establishing a motor route for pilgrims from Iraq to the Hejaz. Protracted negotiations have resulted in an agreement in principle that a service of Iraqi cars should run from Nejef, via Hail (not Jauf, as the Iraqis at first proposed), to Medina, but no further. It has been further agreed that all quarantine and other administrative arrangements, concerning both parties shall be concentrated at Jumaima, on the frontier, and not just outside Medina, as at first suggested by the Saudi Government. At the end of the year there was still a difference as to whether permanent buildings should be erected at Jumaima, an Iraqi desideratum strongly opposed by the Saudi Government. This was the only matter of principle still in dispute, but much spade work remained to be done. It is doubtful how far Ibn Saud really favours the project. (iv) As a result apparently of disputes over the taxation of tribes, both Governments had occasion to complain of violations of the frontier. The Iraqi Government alleged at least two such violations, but had to admit and apologise for a light-hearted escapade on the part of a newly-appointed commandant of police in the Southern Desert, who let himself be provoked into pushing well into Nejd territory. These little affairs do not seem to have had any important effect on relations.6 14. The Saudi Government do not appear to have pressed Iraq much, if at all, since the establishment of direct relations, over the question of the hospitality still enjoyed in Iraq by minor personages concerned in the Nejd rebellion of 1929. 15. It is worth noting as a matter bearing sidewise on relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq that a Yemeni delegation visited Bagdad in April t^^ exchange ratifications of the treaty concluded between Iraq and the Yemen 1931, when members of Nuri Pasha’s mission to the Hejaz went on to Sana. The ratifications were exchanged on the 28th April. In November the Iraqi consul-general at Cairo, apparently a rather irresponsible gentleman, though he professed to have a private watching brief from King Feisal for Syria and Western Arabia, engaged in a curious conversation with the oriental secretary of the Residency at Cairo, whom he sounded as to the desirability of establishing an Iraqi mission at Sana to counter Soviet and Italian influence. He observed, inter alia, that, although Italy was anti-Ibn Saud, Iraq preferred that he should remain in control of the Hejaz for the present; adding that Iraq would gradually grow stronger and would eventually be in a position to help the suffering tribes of the Hejaz without outside help. 16. Another matter which may affect relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia is the project, which was much discussed in 1932 in Palestine and elsewhere, to assemble a general Arab Congress. Ibn Saud has shown so little inclination to commit himself on this subject that it cannot yet be regarded as a matter very directly concerning Saudi Arabia. In an interview with a Mecca journalist in September 1932 he replied to a question on the subject in vague language of general sympathy with all legitimate Arab aspirations. The interesting point is that the promoters themselves seem to be divided into three camps favouring the respective claims of Mecca, Bagdad and Damascus to be the seat of the congress, the arrangements for which have been delayed by their divergence of view. Kamil-al-Qassab, an advocate of Mecca being chosen as the venue, visited Ibn Saud at Riyadh towards the end of the year, with what result is not known. It is more than doubtful whether the King would welcome a gathering of ardent Arabs at Mecca, whereas King Feisal seems only too anxious to see one held in Bagdad. 17. It may be deduced from various indications, only some of which emerge from the preceding paragraphs, that, in spite of all their recent friendliness, there is a latent rivalry between Ibn Saud and King Feisal for hegemony in the Arab world. Their methods are different. Ibn Saud relies on the prestige derived from his conquests. King Feisal, more politic, seems to have some sort of a combine between Iraq and Syria as his first objective, and to think that he can bank on the decay of Ibn Saud to promote the realisation of his ultimate ideal, which is probably some kind of federation of Arab States, ruled to a large extent, though not exclusively, by himself and other members of the Hashimite family. One of the personages who might reappear in connexion with such a project is old Nuri Shalan, who has for a long time appeared to play no major political role, but who still has influence, and is probably in touch with both King Feisal and the Amir Abdullah. Transjordan. General Course of Events. 18. In 1931 such actual incidents as occurred on the frontier between Transjordan and Saudi Arabia were overshadowed by the volume of the political controversies to which they gave rise. It was arranged early in 1932 that Sir Andrew Ryan should visit Jerusalem to exchange views with the High Commissioner on the position generally, and more particularly regarding the only important frontier incident of the previous autumn. On the 28th September, 1931, a party of Shararat tribesmen had raided, inside the Hejaz, but close to the frontier, a mixed camp of tribesmen belonging to the Beni Atiya and the Atun section of the Huweytat-bin-Jazi, a Transjordan tribe which had suffered heavily from earlier raids. The Atun lost nearly 200 camels, and there was a storm of indignation among the British authorities in Transjordan, who considered the Atun to be unquestionably Transjordan nationals. Ibn' Saud had bluntly claimed them as his own, and had insisted that he should be left toi deal with the matter himself. The case was complicated by other factors too numerous to mention, but doubts were entertained in London on the question of nationality, and Sir Andrew Ryan’s departure for Jerusalem was expedited lest the tribal tension to which the raid had given rise should have untoward results, which might be aggravated by delay. ** 19. Sir Andrew Ryan’s discussions at Jerusalem and Amman covered a wide range of subjects, and produced a useful understanding with the Transjordan authorities on many points, including the nationality of the Atun, the Trans jordanian claim to whom appeared to be very strong. He was, however, prevented from attempting a clean-up with the Saudi Government owing to his recall to London in the circumstances related elsewhere. Although His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires dealt in his absence with such matters as arose, there was no general discussion of Transjordan frontier questions up to the end of May, when the Ibn Rifada affair put a new face on the whole situation. 20. The Saudi Government had referred incidentally to the machinations of Ibn Rifada in a note about the Beni Atiya, dated the 14th May, 1932. When they heard on the 30th May that he had actually entered their territory nine days earlier, their first reaction was one of resentment against the Transjordan Govern ment, whom they accused of complicity, the British authorities in Transjordan, whom they accused of negligence if not worse, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, whom they accused of having disregarded their warnings. As a matter of fact, Ibn Rifada had started from Egypt and though he collected recruits in Palestine and possibly in Transjordan, many of his followers had also set out from Egypt, apparently in small unarmed parties. His force may have received assistance and collected arms just outside Aqaba, but the conditions there and the narrowness of the strips of Palestine and Transjordan territory converging on the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, are such that no frontier control could have been expected to detect the movement without express forewarning. When the news reached Amman and Jerusalem, the British authorities took immediate action. The Amir Abdullah was moved to issue, on the 27th or the 28th May, orders which amounted to disavowal of Ibn Rifada. Guarantees were taken from tribal chiefs and steps, which were believed to be effective, were taken to restrain the Beni Atiya tribesmen, most of whom were then in Transjordan, from joining in the revolt. A stringent system of control was gradually built up to prevent reinforcements and supplies from reaching the rebels. ^ Special forces were organised to police the frontier near Aqaba. The Red Sea sloops were detailed for service in the Gulfs of Aqaba and Suez. Arrangements were made with the Egyptian Government to take similar precautionary measures on the Sinai frontier and in their ports. Willingly or unwillingly the Amir Abdullah played the British game. He assented in June to a law prohibiting the export of food-stuffs. He signed a proclamation on the 2nd July creating a prohibited zone along the frontier. He promised General Wauchope on the 7th July to make it known to all that he was supporting the Resident at Amman and Ilis Majesty s Government in their measures, and would not countenance the rebel movement. He gave effect to this promise in orders addressed to the Arab Legion on the 21st July. 21. Space does not admit of a more complete account of what passed between the 20th May and the 30th July, when Ibn Rifada was destroyed. Suffice it to say that after the first reaction described above the Saudi Government modified their attitude. Up to the 15th June they were complaining of the inadequacy of the measures taken and were asking for more. From the 21st June onward they took the line that they and His Majesty’s Government were combating a common danger, and admitted that the British authorities in Transjordan weie doing all they could. They remained unrelenting, however, in their hostility to the Amir Abdullah and his Government. They tried hard to commit His Majesty’s Government to a joint investigation of responsibilities under article 6 of the Hadda Agreement, a suggestion which His Majesty’s Government firmly resisted though they did not exclude the possibility of an eventual investigation of their own. 22. There was undoubtedly a storm of emotion in Nejd over the Ibn Rifada affair, which was attributed universally to the intrigues of the Amir Abdullah and very widely to secret hostility on the p&amp;rt of Gre&amp;t Biit&amp;m. The stiength of [8544] B 4the feeling against the former was demonstrated by a mass of documents published in the Mecca Umm-al-Qura of the 5th August, the first number to appear after the defeat of the rebels. Among those who had clamoured for drastic action were the King’s eldest son, the Ulema of Nejd and the Ikhwan. Ihe King was too politic to let himself be embroiled with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. Having disposed of Ibn Rifada, he dispersed the bulk of the Ikhwajp^ promising, it was said, to inform them of the result of his diplomatic action by middle of October. His first step in a new diplomatic campaign against the Amir was to send a “ personal and private ” memorandum to Sir Andrew Ryan on the 5th August for transmission to His Majesty’s Government. He restated vigorously his grievances against Abdullah. He suggested explicitly that the only cure was the removal of the Amir. Admitting that this was a matter for His Majesty’s Government to decide, he propounded as an alternative that they should guarantee “the neutrality of Transjordan and its non-interference of our affairs.” He would trust such a guarantee, but added that “in that case the Sharif Abdullah should cease from all his activities and foregatherings, both hidden and open.” 23. Although His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to engage in any formal investigation of the origins of the Ibn Rifada affair and the other activities connected with it, Sir Andrew Ryan was asked at this juncture to prepare a review of the available evidence for use on his return to England on leave early in September. He produced a voluminous memorandum which tended to the general conclusion that there was a widespread conspiracy with ramifications in South-Eastern Arabia, Eritrea, Egypt and elsewhere, and that it had the closest connexion with Amman. He considered that three personages in the Amir’s entourage were deeply implicated, namely, the Amir Shakir, Hamid Pasha-al- Wadi and one Abdurrauf-as-Sabban. He discovered no evidence against the Amir Abdullah himself, unless it were a presumption that he must have been a party to proceedings in which so many people about him were involved. 24. By the time Sir Andrew Ryan reached London one more hopeful factor had come into the situation. General Wauchope had obtained from the Amir Abdullah on the 1st September an expression of readiness to recognise Ibn Saud, if required, a course to which the Amir had previously been bitterly opposed. The promise was unconditional, although the Amir expressed some not unreasonable desiderata, one of which was that His Majesty’s Government should arrange for a treaty of friendship between him and Ibn Saud. King Feisal of Iraq would appear to have played some part in producing this result, although an earlier suggestion that he should act as honest broker, on a request from Ibn Saud and with the blessing of His Majesty’s Government, had fallen through. The main credit belongs to General Wauchope, whose action paved the way for a communication addressed to the Saudi Government by Mr. Hope Gill on behalf of His Majesty’s Government on the 6th October. It intimated that the Amir Abdullah was prepared to recognise Ibn Saud as King of Saudi Arabia subject to similar recognition of his own position. It suggested that mutual recognition should be the first step, to be followed by immediate negotiations for a treaty between the two rulers. It expressed the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to take part in the negotiations, and, if a treaty were concluded, to use their best endeavours to secure the loyal execution of its terms. Reference was made to the wish which Ibn Saud had repeatedly expressed during the first stages of the Ibn Rifada affair and earlier for a settlement similar to that arrived at with Iraq in 1931. 25. Ibn Saud replied in a memorandum forwarded to Mr. Hope Gill on the 13th October. He agreed to mutual recognition and to treaty negotiations “on the lines of the treaty with Iraq, subject to the condition that the British Govern ment shall guarantee it and shall be responsible for the execution of the terms of that treaty in Transjordan in the event of the Amir violating any of his obligations.” On receipt of this memorandum, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom prepared a draft reply showing precisely what they had in view. It was proposed to suggest a procedure for mutual recognition and to define the position of His Majesty’s Government vis-a-vis of the Amir, in such terms as to make it plain that they w T ould consider themselves responsible for ensuring the fulfilment of any international obligations contracted by him and9 his Government. The note was to reaffirm the view that His Majesty’s Govern ment should take part in the negotiations and to express readiness to confirm the statement regarding their ultimate responsibility by an exchange of notes at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, if necessary. This draft was referred to the High Commissioner for his views. The communication had not actually ' k 'een addressed to the Saudi Government up to the end of the year. 26. Although Ibn Saud acquiesced guardedly in the political programme of His Majesty’s Government, he did not relax his hostility towards those conspiring against him, at whose head he still saw the Amir of Transjordan. His resent ment was further inflamed by the outbreak in Asir at the beginning of November. His grievances were restated in two memoranda communicated to Mr. Hope Gill on the 15th and 26th November regarding cc the activities attributed to the Sharif Abdullah and his associates.” The first enumerated various people who had been active in Transjordan, Palestine, Aden, Eritrea, Egypt and the Yemen. The second ended on a note which could be construed as one of menace. The Saudi Government wished, they said, ££ to draw the attention of the British Government to the happenings that may possibly occur if they on their side do not institute some decisive action in Transjordan to put an end to the propaganda and intrigues which the conspirators are using to stir up trouble in the country of His Majesty.” These communications stimulated the desire of His Majesty’s Government for intensified measures against the conspirators. Unfortunately, although much had been done in this direction by the end of the year, His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan did not consider that there was a strong enough case to justify drastic action against two of the principal personages concerned, viz., the Amir Shakir and Hamid Pasha A1 Wadi. Maintained in office by the Amir Abdullah with the acquiescence of the British authorities, these two gentlemen still enjoyed a security of tenure which might be envied by the statesmen of other lands, but which was regrettable in its effects on the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. 27. The year ended in an atmosphere of anxiety lest Ibn Saud should attack Transjordan. He was believed to have Ikhwan concentrated at Hail and there were rumours of war standards arriving at Jauf. The further developments belong to 1933, but it may be stated here that the fears which had been entertained were to a large extent dissipated in January. The Beni Atiya. 28. Mention has been made above of the Beni Atiya. This troublesome tribe ranges on both sides of the frontier. Ibn Saud claims them as his subjects, and his claim, though it has never been definitely admitted by Transjordan, is probably valid except as regards an agricultural section, settled in the Kerak area. Whatever their allegiance, the Beni Atiya are, in fact, a potential instrument in the hands of either Ibn Saud or the Amir Abdullah. When the bulk of them were in Saudi Arabia in 1931, they at first enjoyed the King’s favour. To quote the phrases of Captain Glubb, they were then “ his blue-eyed boys” and “his watchdogs on the frontier.” They became so turbulent that they incurred his displeasure in the autumn. It was anticipated that the King would take steps to punish them and that they would migrate again to Transjordan. The authorities there laid preliminary plans to deal with this contingency. The move started in February 1932 and was apparently already in progress when in that month a punitive expedition was launched against the Beni Atiya from Tabuk. It was more of a governmental raid than a military operation and returned quickly to base with a prize of camels. When the tribesmen, still moving northward, reached the frontier, it was not very clear whether they were fleeing from the wrath behind or merely heading for the grazing in front. The Transjordan authorities took the more charitable view and admitted them into their territory, taking measures, however, to control them. The passage of the first parties was the signal for Saudi protests both in London and Jedda, where the Minister for Foreign Affairs, replying on the 9th March to an intimation from Mr. Hope Gill regarding the movement, definitely requested that those who had crossed the frontier should be sent back and that no asylum should be given in Transjordan. By the middle of March large numbers had crossed and had been moved north of Maan in accoi dance with the plan made, when the probability of their entering Transjordan was hi st foreseen. [8544] B 510 On the 22nd April Mr. Hope Gill informed the Saudi Government, under instructions, that the Transjordan Government could not comply with their request for the return of the Beni Atiya, but referred again to the measures taken to prevent them from causing trouble. The Saudi Government retorted on the 14th May with a wordy remonstrance, which Mr. Hope Gill answered on the 22nd May. It was in their note of the 14th May that the Saudi Government firstp^ mentioned the machinations of Ibn Rifada. The subsequent correspondence about his invasion of the Hejaz swamped for the time being that about the Beni Atiya. 29. As stated above, one of the first measures taken in Transjordan in connexion with the Ibn Rifada affair was to reinforce the control of the Beni Atiya. Their chiefs were at that time at Kerak. Following on visits paid by some of them to Amman, the word went round the tribesmen in June that any move against Ibn Saud would be approved by both the Transjordan and British Governments. When this became known, Captain Glubb hurried to Kerak and took strenuous measures to restrain the tribesmen, whom he found in a ferment of saddling and riding. He was too late, however, to stop one party of some seventy men, who had started on the 19th June and got across the frontier east of Mudawwara on the night of the 26th June, after rushing a small Transjordan police patrol. The subsequent adventures of this band were varied. They brought off one successful raid on quite a large scale. A few of them seemed to have joined Ibn Rifada. The others doubled hither and thither on both sides of the frontier and apparently foregathered with remnants of Ibn Rifada’s supporters. It is not clear that the Saudi troops ever finally disposed of them, but they ceased to be an effective force. Some finally got back into Transjordan, including one of the principal sheikhs, Muhammad-bin-Farhan. Towards the end of the year this man was arrested in Transjordan and sentenced to a year’s imprisonment. 30. In October the authorities in Transjordan changed their policy in regard to the Beni Atiya, and decided to move a large portion of them back into Saudi Arabia as a disciplinary measure. The Saudi Government agreed on receiving a preliminary intimation. After some hesitation, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom sanctioned the move, subject to certain understandings, one of which was that the move should not be effected by force and that persons refusing to obey the order should have the choice of remaining in Transjordan to undergo punishment there. There was a slight hitch owing to an attack said to have been delivered by Ikhwan on a small party of Beni Atiya who crossed the frontier on the 10th November, but the arrangements for moving the bulk of the tribe were proceeded with. Captain Glubb reported on the 20th November that the crossing was complete and that the number of tents moved was 110. 31. The principal reason for this action was the belief of the British authorities at Amman that the Beni Atiya were being tampered with and encouraged by the Amirs Abdullah and Shakir in connexion with schemes of their own. The Amir Abdullah, however, consented to the action proposed after a first expression of unwillingness, and suggested sending a personal telegram to Ibn Saud. His message, in a somewhat modified form, was conveyed by Mr. Hope Gill through the Saudi Government on the 19th November and elicited a polite, though cold, reply through the same channels. Lie of the Frontier. 32. A reference was made in paragraph 23 of last year’s report to the thorny question which arose in 1931 over the inaccuracy of the maps in the frontier region, owing to an erroneous showing of the country relatively to the lines of latitude and longitude and to doubt as to the relative placing of the physical features of the country itself. The Legation in Jedda has been little concerned in this question. It has been actively pursued in Whitehall, where “ graticule ” has become a household word in circles to which it was previously unknown. The question came to have an immediate bearing on the frontier situation in the summer of 1932, when the name of Haditha began to recur in a series of complaints by the Saudi Government of visits by Transjordan police, &amp;c., to places in their territory. Haditha is, in fact, a very marginal spot. It was11 [8544] b 6 admitted that it had been patrolled at intervals by the authorities in Transjordan, and it was at first thought that they were within their rights. A prolonged examination of the question proved that it was in Nejd, whatever view were taken of the exact lie of the frontier. A suitable communication was made to the Saudi Government on the 29th October. His Majesty’s Government agreed to regard Haditha as being in Nejd, but the note was sufficiently guarded to leave * ■ ^*1 loophole for reopening the matter in the event of a delimitation. The note rebutted other accusations of violation of Saudi territory. The Transjordan Government had on their side reason to complain of action taken by Saudi authorities in September and October in places much more clearly within their boundaries. Representations regarding these violations were in contemplation at the end of the year. Raiding. 33. The situation as regards raiding on the frontier can be summed up briefly. On the 7th and 8th January a further meeting took place between Captain Glubb and Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeyd. It was very friendly, but no progress was made towards a settlement in regard to outstanding raids. Captain Glubb was unwilling to discuss other cases pending a settlement of that of the Atun (see paragraphs 18 and 19 above). Ibn Zeyd did not, oddly enough, raise the question of nationality, but found other reasons of a nature too technical to describe here for giving no satisfaction. Following on Sir Andrew Ryan’s report of his discussions at Jerusalem and Amman, it was eventually decided in London to urge the Saudi Government that the matter should be pursued between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeyd. They considered that, if certain principles in regard to the technical questions, on which they shared Captain Glubb’s views, were admitted, it would be unnecessary to thresh out the question of nationality, although, if it were pursued, they must regard the Atun as Transjordan nationals. A note on these lines was addressed to the Saudi Government on the 18th May, and Mr. Hope Gill had a conversation with the Acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 25th May. The matter was then submerged by the Ibn Rifada affair and its sequel until October, when the Saudi Government, replying to a reminder, insisted on their view that the Atun were their nationals. On this, Mr. Hope Gill referred for further instructions. The matter was still outstanding at the end of 1932. So were all the other cases intended to be discussed between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeyd. His Majesty’s Government had decided early in the year that the discussion of these should not be subordinated to a settlement of the Atun case, but the course of events precluded any further meetings on the frontier between the 8th January and the 31st December. 34. Despite the perturbation caused by the Ibn Rifada affair, the situation in regard to ordinary tribal raiding remained healthy throughout the year. The raid by the Beni Atiya who crossed the frontier on the night of the 26th June (see paragraph 29) must be regarded as a feature of the general situation rather than as an ordinary raid. Early in the year Fuad Bey Hamza drew attention semi-officially to five raids alleged on imperfect information to have been carried out from Transjordan in December 1931. Enquiries in Transjordan showed that one and probably all were the work of the Beni Atiya in the Hejaz, and the Saudi authorities did not pursue the matter on being so informed. Two other pre-1932 affairs came to the notice of the Legation during the year. The Transjordan authorities called attention to the robbery of forty camels by a single Billi tribes man from his hosts in Transjordan in October 1931. In November the Saudi Government raked up a very old story of a raid in August 1930, which had apparently been mentioned at the Glubb-Ibn Zeyd meetings, but had not hitherto been the subject of diplomatic protest. For the rest, apart from the Beni Atiya affair, the Legation files record only five raids of minor importance alleged to have taken place in 1932. Saudi Arabia was accused in one case; Transjordan in four. In two of the latter the Transjordan authorities effected recoveries of camels and handed them over to the Governor of Qaf to be returned to the owners. In the one case alleged against Saudi tribesmen the Saudi Government gave satisfaction.12 Other Matters. 35. In view of the changes in the situation between Saudi Arabia and Transjordan in 1932 and the prospect of further changes in 1933, it is hardly worth while to deal with any matters other than the above. The following four points, however, may be noted :— (a) MacDonnell Finding .—No question turning on this arose in 1932. Thap^ Saudi share in the cost of Mr. MacDonnell’s investigation remains unpaid. (b) Status of Aqaba-Maan .—This question remained in abeyance throughout the year. Towards the end of it tendentious rumours were circulated in the press that there was serious trouble between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud over Aqaba. They had no foundation or shadow of foundation. (c) Druse Refugees .—^'Permission was given by the Transjordan Government in June for Sultan-al-Atrash to settle in Transjordan not further north than Kerak. (d) Customs Relations .—The draft reply to the Saudi Government’s last communication on this subject took final shape in March 1932, but as the general question had long been in practical abeyance it was decided not to send the note unless the Hejazi Government should return to the charge. The Transjordan authorities had already issued the warning to traders mentioned in paragraph 33 (c) of the annual report for 1931. In May they brought their legislation into accord with the principles hammered out during the discussion of the draft note, by authorising, subject to certain conditions, the passage through Transjordan between Syria and Saudi Arabia of certain goods, other than arms and ammunition, the importation of which into Trans jordan itself is prohibited. Yemen. 36. Asir has now become so much a part of Saudi Arabia that most matters relating to it can no longer be dealt with under the same heading as the Yemen as in the two preceding reports. They are reserved for the sections dealing with the internal situation and relations wuth Italy below. 37. The treaty concluded between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya on the 15th December, 1931, after the former had waived his claim to Jebel Arwa, appears to have been ratified by an exchange of telegrams, one addressed by Ibn Saud to the Imam on the 29th December, 1931, and one by the Imam to Ibn Saud on the 23rd January, 1932. The Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura announced the exchange of ratifications on the 19th February, 1932, and published the text of the treaty a week later. The Saudi Government communicated it to the foreign missions on the 13th March. All this publicity on the Saudi side notwithstanding, it was still thought early in the year that the Imam made very light of the Treaty of Abu Arish. It had been ignored by his one newspaper. The Netherlands Charge d’Affaires in Jedda, who visited the Imam in March, related on his return that the Imam had received his congratulations on the establishment of friend ship between him and Ibn Saud with hearty abdominal laughter at the idea of his having signed any treaty. He represented what had been negotiated as a mere working agreement between local Governors by which a modus vivendi had been established on the frontier. 38. Whatever the value of the treaty, the relations between the two countries appear to have been correct throughout the year. The Idrisi revolt against Ibn Saud at the beginning of November naturally stimulated speculation as to the Imam’s true attitude, and gave rise to rumours that he was behind the rebels. The general consensus of opinion up to the end of the year was that he continued far too cautious to risk a quarrel with Ibn Saud over a doubtful enter prise. What his attitude would be if it promised success is another matter. Anyhow, the position at the end of December was that he and Ibn Saud had exchanged sympathetic telegrams, if all other correspondence was as friendly as two rather curious specimens published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 2nd December, and that the Saudi Government, in communiques and inspired13 a articles had paid warm tributes to the Imam, another of those perfectly sound Arabs whom Ibn Saud loves. 39. While the revolt in Asir was coming to a head, Ibn Saud decided to send an envoy direct from Riyadh to Sana. The person chosen was a secretary or clerk in his Divan, one Muhammad-bin-Dhawi, apparently a man of no great Recount. He seems to have reached Sana some time in November or early in December and was still there at the end of the year. In describing his mission to Sir Andrew Ryan early in January, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned frontier delimitation as one of the questions requiring friendly discussion. Although Fuad Bey seemed to know little about the business, which is one of the King’s own subjects, it is more than likely that the frontier is pretty ill-defined. It is not described or even adverted to in the published treaty. All that is known of it is that it would appear to abut on the sea at the mouth of the Wadi Tashar about 15 miles north of Midi and to run inland in a general north-easterly direction, leaving Jebel Arwa and Saada admittedly inside Yemen territory though close to the boundary. 40. The question of the lie of the frontier was of special interest at the end of 1932 as the Asir rebels appeared to be still in some force in the highlands near the border, and their presence in doubtful territory might easily increase the possibility of complications between Ibn Saud and the Imam. The Idrisi himself was said to have taken refuge in the Jebel Faifa, which is probably in Asir but has nevertheless been described by an informant worthy of attention as belonging to the Yemen and as being inhabited by Zeydi co-religionists of the Imam in real or ostensible revolt against him. States in the South and South-East of Arabia. 41. Nothing that came to the notice of the legation in 1932 suggests any modification of the view expressed in paragraph 41 of the report for 1931 that Ibn Saud seems to respect the undertaking implied in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda not to interfere in Qatar and the Oman coast. It has been suggested in Jedda that he dabbles in the politics of the Hadramaut, but the suggestion lacks substance. 42. There was no serious trouble during the year in connexion with Hadhramis in the Hejaz. His Majesty’s Minister feared at one moment that he might have to intervene eventually on behalf of a Hadhrami notable, who was among the persons arrested in June (see paragraph 104), and deported to Riyadh. The man’s own relatives expressed a wish that the Legation should not intervene, and he was eventually allowed to return. At the time of the urban census (paragraph 176) it looked as though many of the Hadhramis themselves were unwilling to describe themselves as British protected and preferred to call themselves subjects of the Qaiti Sultan. Later in the year those in Mecca seemed likely to be the first victims of pressure on foreigners in Mecca to produce proofs of nationality within fifteen days, failing which it was expected that they would be required either to leave the country or to accept Saudi nationality. This plan was not pursued up to the end of the year, owing largely, it may be supposed, to the action taken by Mr. Hope Gill (see paragraph 176). Bahrein and Koweit. 43. Ibn Saud’s visit to Hasa in January enabled the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to pay him the visit which had long been contemplated. Colonel Biscoe took with him to Hufuf the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein, Colonel Dickson and Captain Prior. They arrived at Hufuf on the 23rd January and stayed four days. The King, haying agreed to sink his former resentment against Colonel Biscoe and having intimated that he would be willing to discuss matters of common interest, kept his word in both respects right royally. The courtesy and hospitality shown to the party left nothing to be desired. At parting the King charged Colonel Biscoe with a cordial message of friendship to the British Government which unfortunately reached London at a moment of tension between the two Governments, but was informally acknowledged through Sir Andrew Ryan after that tension had been relieved. Political Resident's Visit to Ibn Saud. [8544] b 714 44. Colonel Biscoe’s discussions with the King and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin covered a wide range of subjects as follows:— (а) The Saudi embargo on trade between Nejd and Koweit. (б) The proposed creation of emergency landing grounds for aircraft on the Hasa coast. (c) The establishment of telegraphic and postal communication between Hasi and the outer world. ^ (d) The status of Ibn Saud’s representatives at Bahrein and Koweit. (e) Nejdi intrusions in Koweit territory. (/) The possibility of a simple extradition treaty between Bahrein and Nejd and arrangements for the exchange of judicial summonses. (g) Access for the Hindu traders known as Bunnias to Hasa. (h) Various matters relating to passports, visas, &amp;c., and manifests for vessels trading between Hasa and Bahrein. 45. Except as regards (a), which will be dealt with below, and (b), which will be dealt with in the section on aviation, the ensuing position in regard to these matters may be dismissed briefly as follows :— (c) The question of telegraphic communication has not been pursued on either side. The Legation in Jedda communicated to the Saudi Government on the 23rd July, the proposals of the Indian Government regarding mails. The Saudi Government agreed to them in September, and proposed that the service between Hasa and foreign countries via Bahrein should be instituted as from the 1st November. The Government of India found it impossible to inaugurate it so soon, but promised to do so as early as possible. Nothing more had been heard up to the end of December. (d) Colonel Biscoe explained to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin the difficulties in the way of according recognition to Ibn Saud’s agents as persons of consular status. Sheikh Yussuf did not press the matter, and the Saudi Government have not since reverted to it. (e) The Legation in Jedda had already on the 11th January complained of various instances in August and October 1931 of improper action by Ibn Saud’s officials and patrols in Koweit territory. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs returned a somewhat impertinent reply on the 23rd January and, whether by accident or design, misrepresented the purport of Sir Andrew Ryan’s repre sentations to the King. Colonel Biscoe was able to clear the matter up at Hufuf, and Sir Andrew Ryan explained it further to Euad Bey Hamza in a personal letter. After this the diplomatic correspondence was allowed to drop. It is satisfactory to note that a sufficient apology was tendered locally for a further Nejdi intrusion in March 1932. (/) The new Political Resident, Colonel Fowle, informed Sir Andrew Ryan in a letter of the 6th August that a draft extradition treaty prepared by the Bahrein Government had been returned to them for alteration by Sir Hugh Biscoe and would shortly be submitted to His Majesty’s Government. The Legation in Jedda has no later information. The question of judicial summonses does not seem to have been pursued. (g) Colonel Biscoe obtained a promise that Bunnias would be allowed to visit Qatif for trading purposes only and for periods not exceeding two months, subject to an understanding that either side might suggest any modification of this arrangement. In June Sir Andrew Ryan tried, at the instance of Sir H. Biscoe, to get the period extended to three months and to obtain the same concession in regard to visits to Jubail. Ibn Saud agreed to the extension of the time allowed for visits to Qatif, but refused any facilities for visits to Jubail. (h) The Legation has little information regarding these matters, and they are not in any case of sufficient general interest to be dealt with further in this report. Koweit Blockade. 46. One of the main objects of Colonel Biscoe was to induce Ibn Saud to relax the embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd, which has come to be known as the “ Koweit Blockade.” In the earlier discussions at Hufuf, the Kino- broached three alternative suggestions regarding possible customs arrangements! Two of these he admitted in the subsequent discussions to be impracticable. The[8544] B 8 third was that the Sheikh of Koweit should make a fixed annual payment representing the Nejdi share of the duties levied at Koweit. All three were unwelcome to the sheikh. It was therefore decided by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to pursue a more general proposal which had emerged from the discussions, namely, that the whole matter should be referred to commissioners representing both sides, who should attempt ad referendum to find ' solution; and to couple with this a hint, strong enough to amount to an offer, that if a satisfactory arrangement were arrived at, the sheikh would waive claims against Ibn Saud, which he had put at an enormous figure but which had been scaled down to something like £110,000. Colonel Biscoe had expressed in 1931 the view that they were perfectly valid for the latter amount, but His Majesty’s Government had decided at that time not to put them forward. They now thought that they might be used as a lever to obtain a settlement of the blockade question. Sir Andrew Ryan accordingly addressed a note to the Saudi Govern ment on the 19th August regarding the proposal for a meeting of commissioners, and conveyed the offer about claims in a personal letter of the same date. 47. Ibn Saud went right into the air. He was being asked, he said, to negotiate under a threat, and a threat all the more wanton as it had been agreed at the Hufuf meeting and confirmed by subsequent letters exchanged between him and the sheikh that, subject to a single exception, all claims up to Ramadan 1349 (January-Eebruary 1930) should be washed out. He refused to proceed with the discussion of the proposal for a meeting of commissioners until the question of claims was disposed of and he could judge whether the sheikh had any respect for agreements; he offered contemptuously to meet one or two small claims for money lent and rice supplied many years before, if the sheikh, who had then insisted on giving them as presents, now insisted on payment. 48. Nothing that could be said in Jedda would budge Ibn Saud from this attitude. Sir Andrew Ryan believed, and it was subsequently confirmed, that in the view of the authorities in the Persian Gulf the understanding invoked by the King applied only to small claims between tribesmen arising out of frontier incidents and could not be held to rule out the claims against Ibn Saud which the sheikh had advanced. An examination of the correspondence showed, however, that it might be difficult to enforce on Ibn Saud a view which turned on the interpretation of the Arabic letters exchanged. It was considered in London that, unless the sheikh thought he himself could induce the King to accept his interpretation of the letters, it might be more politic to drop at once all claims except those which Ibn Saud had offered to pay. Colonel Fowle was asked in December to give his views on this suggestion. The whole matter was still outstanding at the end of the year. 49. The truth appears to be that, whether honest or not in his attitude about the claims, Ibn Saud has no intention of relaxing the blockade. He enforced it rigorously throughout 1932, and in the autumn replaced the frontier officer responsible for it by another of peculiarly evil antecedents, who proceeded to tighten it up. The King’s ultimate ambition is alleged to be to squeeze the sheikh to such an extent as to get the port of Koweit for himself. 50. Notwithstanding the trouble over the blockade, the personal relations between Ibn Saud and the sheikh were quite delightful in the early part of the year. They exchanged letters of the most charming kind with enclosures about business matters. There was some pretty rapier-play over an acidulous complaint by Ibn Saud that the Koweit pilgrims were smuggling precious merchandise into Nejd, but even this did not mar the harmony. The sheikh visited the King at Riyadh in March. He was greatly impressed by his reception, though he drew a gloomy picture on his return of Ibn Saud s physical condition and thought he over-ate. The two rulers apparently discussed no business. The sheikh went away with handsome presents, including a car that Mr. Crane had given to the King, and a conditional promise of a return visit. The friendship seems to have cooled off somewhat after the claims episode, but the two Arcadians continued to correspond. Bahrein Transit Dues. 51. Apart from the questions mentioned above in connexion with Colonel Biscoe’s visit to Hasa, the only important matter that aiose between Bahiein andI 16 Saudi Arabia in 1932 had to do with transit dues. It would overload this report to trace in detail the vicissitudes of this question, one aspect of which was dealt with briefly in paragraph 52 (c) of the report for 1931. As a matter between Bahrein and Saudi Arabia it turns on the character as an international instrument of the letter addressed by the Political Agent at Bahrein to Ibn Saud on the 14th July, 1920, the material portion of which ran thus : “ It is decided that, in accordance with international rules generally accepted, only 2 per cent will be charged on transit goods consigned to the mainland provided that these are removed from the Bahrein custom-house within twenty days from date of landing. If goods are taken from steamers direct into lighters which proceed to the mainland without touching Bahrein, no duty will be charged by the ruler of Bahrein.” 52. The question of transit dues creates soreness on both sides. The concession in the letter of the 14th July, 1920, was imposed by British authority on the Sheikh of Bahrein. For many years no advantage was taken of the provision regarding “overside” goods delivered direct from steamer to dhow, but of late there has been a growing tendency to arrange for overside delivery, and even for such delivery outside the limits of the port of Bahrein. The revenues of Bahrein have naturally suffered. On the other hand, Ibn Saud resents the unwillingness of the Bahrein Government to exempt from transit dues goods for his use, the fact being that the Bahrein authorities are very ready to exempt goods genuinely intended for his personal use but not those for what are really governmental purposes, like feeding his troops and resale to tribes. Fuad Bey Hamza suggested in London in May that this attitude was compelling his Government to attempt to create a port at Ras Tanura, a project which, he observed, would hit Bahrein hard, if it were carried out successfully. 53. The phases of the question in 1932 may be summed up as follows, without any attempt to give a full account of them :— (a) The suggestion that a threat to increase the dues might be used if Ibn Saud proved recalcitrant over the Kowait blockade (see paragraph 48 of the report for 1931) was not pursued. It is probably no longer a practical proposition. (b) The Political Agent at Bahrein explained in May his part in the arrange ment mentioned in paragraph 52 (c) of the report for 1931, under which it was expected that the British India Steam Navigation Company would refuse goods for oveiside delivery. His restatement of the facts showed that he had not entered into any formal agreement, and that it was the company who were unwilling to accept such goods. (It may be observed in parenthesis that the company were driven by competition later in the year to contemplate a reversal of this policy.) The suggestion that it might be well to cancel the arrangement spontaneously, even if Ibn Saud did not protest, was dropped. (c) Shoi tly before the 26th June the deputy ruler of Bahrein addressed a long letter to the Political Resident announcing and justifying his decision to abolish the exemption in favour of overside goods. The whole question of its disastrous effect on the finances of Bahrein was then much to the fore. (d) On the 23rd June the Saudi Government protested against the action of the Bahrein Government in regard to a particular cargo, and expressly invoked the letter of the 14th July, 1920. They chose their case so badly and stated it so inaccurately that it was easy to rebut their protest. Nevertheless, the Bahrein Government granted exemption as an exceptional measure. (e) Consideration of the deputy ruler’s announcement in India and London pointed strongly to the conclusion that it would be legitimate and only just to Bahrein to denounce the concession in regard to overside goods, which in any case, only applied to goods unloaded from steamers, although sailing ships had been allowed to take advantage of it. It had almost been decided to make a suitable communication to Ibn Saud, when the surprising discovery was made that the Saudi Government were paying without demur dues on overside goods even when unloaded outside the limits of the port at Bahrein. It was therefore decided in November to make no communication, unless the Saudi Government should revert to the question. (/) The whole matter entered on a new phase about the beginning of November. Certain shipowners had conceived the plan of loading cargo both for Bahrein and the mainland, unloading the former at Bahrein and proceeding, thus17 lightened, with the rest to ports in Hasa. The Bahrein Government reinforced stringent, though, perhaps, legitimate measures to preserve their entrepot trade by the very doubtful means of requiring payment of Bahrein dues on cargo for Hasa carried on those conditions. A particular case in which a ship had refused compliance and preferred to carry its Bahrein cargo on to Hasa ports, provoked the Saudi Government to protest on the 15th November, and to raise with His Majesty’s Government the general question of a definite settlement in regard to customs and transit dues between Bahrein and the mainland. This matter was outstanding at the end of the year. (B) With Powers outside Arabia. Saudi Mission to Europe. 54. Ibn Baud decided in March, probably at the suggestion of Fuad Bey Hamza, to send a mission to the capitals of friendly countries. This mission, the principal members of which were his son the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey, visited all the countries with which Saudi Arabia has definite relations, with the exception of the United States of America and Afghanistan. It sailed in an Italian liner, which put in specially at Jedda to embark it. In its later peregrina tions it made several journeys by air. Although anything of importance that is known of its proceedings will be mentioned in the following sub-sections, the demonstration as a whole was sufficiently impressive to merit this short general account. It must have cost an impoverished country, or perhaps the King, who is not quite so poor, a pretty penny; but it helped to consolidate relations and to make Saudi Arabia better known to the outside world. 55. The following is a list of the places visited, with dates, which are, how ever, only approximate in some cases : Rome, April 19 to 25; Geneva, short stay, dates uncertain, between Rome and Paris; Paris, May 2 to 7; London, May 7 to 16; The Hague, May 16 to 20; Berlin, May 20 to 24; Warsaw, May 24 to 28; Moscow, May 29 to June 5; Constantinople, June 8 to 11 and again on return from Angora; Angora, June 12 to 15, or a little longer; Tehran, July 1 to 5; Bagdad, July 8 to 11; Koweit, July 11 to 18. 56. There were one or two scandalous stories of feminine interest in connexion with the Amir's departure from the Hejaz. Once in Europe he appears to have behaved with decorum. In London he discharged his duties as head of the mission with grace, distinction and modesty, showing to much better advantage than he does in his own country. There and presumably elsewhere he left all serious business in the hands of Fuad Bey. He is said to have found the latter wearing and bumptious towards the end of the tour. At Koweit his decorum broke down. He and a brother who met him engaged in the night life of that place in a manner which scandalised the sheikh and the inhabitants. British Commonwealth. 57. This sub-section deals exclusively with the relations between Saudi Arabia and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, as no question arose in 1932 between the Saudi Government and the Dominions, and any questions of important concern to the Governments of British dependencies find a place elsewhere in the report. 58. Various events in 1931 imposed a considerable strain on the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. They had however, remained correct and fundamentally friendly, and in January 1932 the outlook was no unpromising as regards the Transjordan frontier, which had been responsib e oi much of the trouble in 1931. Unfortunately the relations between the two countries were again temporarily clouded in February and March by a \eiy different affair. 59. In December 1931 a slave named Bakhit took refuge in the Biitish Legation. He had fled from the house of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, the Director-General of Finance, who would appear to be also responsible for the King’s establishment of slaves. The Saudi Government affirmed that Bakhit was the property of the King and invoked an oral undertaking said to have been odven by Sir G. Clayton when negotiating the letters attached to the liea y o Jedda, that the Legation would not give asylum to or manumit the King s own [8544] B 9slaves. It is doubtful whether any such undertaking was given. If it was it almost certainly referred to Royal slaves as defined by the King himself, viz., his personal servants and soldiers. Sir Andrew Ryan, after going carefully into Bakhit’s history, could not admit that Bakhit was a Royal slave in this sense, though he did not question the assurance that he was Royal property. After protracted but unsuccessful efforts to obtain the consent of the Saudi Government to the man’s being repatriated in the usual way, he referred the case to His Majesty’s Government. They instructed him to admit no understanding whatso ever about Royal slaves and to embark Bakhit in H.M.S. Penzance, which happened to be visiting Jedda at the time. The Saudi Government were informed of the intended embarkation and objected violently, but it was effected on the 29th January without interference on the part of the local authorities. 60. It had already been arranged that Sir Andrew Ryan should visit Jerusalem to discuss Transjordan affairs, and he was to leave Jedda on the 4th February. In the circumstances of the Bakhit affair, he altered his plans to the extent of leaving in the sloop on the 2nd February. On his arrival at Jerusalem he received instructions to proceed direct to London after finishing his business. This was the result of a memorandum communicated by the Saudi Government to the Foreign Office on the 8th February through the Hejazi Legation in London. It stated various grievances against Sir Andrew Ryan, culminating in a complaint of his action in the Bakhit affair, and it expressed the view that his continuing to act as intermediary between the two Governments could only aggravate their differences. It was not difficult to dispose of the accusations, old and new, against Sir Andrew Ryan. The Secretary of State returned a strong reply to the Saudi Legation on the 21st March, and the incident was liquidated to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government in the first half of April. 61. His Majesty’s Government awaited the termination of this affair before replying to the Saudi Government’s proposal that the Amir Feisal’s mission should visit London. They now intimated their readiness to receive the mission as their official guests. The mission arrived in London on the 7th May, and was handsomely entertained until the 14th, when the official visit ended, although the mission stayed on privately for another two days. It was received by His Majesty the King on the 9th May, and afterwards by the Secretary of State, who also gave an official dinner on behalf of His Majesty’s Government on the 10th May. As stated elsewhere, the Amir left all business in the hands of Fuad Bey, except for attending a first meeting of a formal nature on the 9th May. This was followed by further business meetings that afternoon and on the 13th May, and by less official conversations between Fuad Bey and the head of the Eastern Department. 62. The discussions with Fuad Bey were most amicable though not conclusive, except on one point. The following is a list of the subjects discussed, with brief indications of what ensued later in the year : — (a) General Relations between the Two Countnes. —The mission was assured in emphatic terms of the friendly dispositions of His Majesty’s Government towards Ibn Saud and his Government. (b) Economic Questions and the possibility of a British Lwm.—Fuad Bey emphasised the economic difficulties of the Saudi Government and their urgent need of money. He asked for a loan of £500,000 gold. He was told sympathetically how impossible it would be for His Majesty’s Government to make a loan themselves to Saudi Arabia. He was put into touch with the Bank o England, and learnt there that prospects in the City were equally unpropitious. A suggestion emerged that the Saudi Government might usefully employ a bank m England as an advisory correspondent, and the Imperial Bank of Persia was suggested. Fuad Bey did not pursue the matter with the latter bank at the time but made further enquiries m Jedda later, with the result that the Legation informed the Saudi Government on the 29th December of the conditions on which the Imperial Bank would be prepared to act. (&lt;f) Harameyn Wakfs. 'Fuad Bey raised the question of what steps the Saudi Government could take to secure for the Holy Places the benefit of religious foundations created in their favour in countries under British rule or influence. It was pursued with special reference to Wakfs in Palestine, and a particular Wakt created under the will of an Indian who had died in Java,[8544] B 10 19 I SA. (d) Transjordan .—The only important point which emerged was a statement by Fuad Bey that Ibn Sand was ready to conclude agreements with Transjordan similar to those made with Iraq in 1931. Sir L. Oliphant received this suggestion sympathetically, and said that, while there were considerable difficulties, a further study of the matter would be pursued energetically. The sequel is related earlier in this report under the heading of relations with Transjordan. ^ (e) Soviet Activities and Propaganda and the Relations between Saudi Arabia and Soviet Russia. —Fuad Bey raised this matter in the form of a very general request for advice, and received a general reply to the effect that, while His Majesty’s Government presumed the views and tenets of the Soviet to be very different from those of Ibn Saud, they could not feel aggrieved if he thought fit to alter his attitude towards the Russian Government. In particular, it was stated that, being unable themselves, to their great regret, to give Ibn Saud a loan, they would not misunderstand his action if he tried to raise one “ elsewhere.” Fuad Bey said he thought it unlikely that there would be any important change in the attitude of his Government towards Russia. Later in the year the King begged His Majesty’s Government to consider the possibility of a loan of £150,000. He intimated clearly that, if they could not, he would have to look to the Soviet Government, who were prepared to lend him anything up to £1,000,000, mainly in the shape of merchandise, but with whom he would have to conclude unwillingly a commercial agreement. His Majesty’s Government couched a fresh refusal in very cordial terms. (f) Possibility o/ t sending a Royal Air Force Mission to train the Hejazi Air Force. —This was broached by Fuad Bey as a personal suggestion, and was discussed informally with Mr. Rendel and a” representative of the Air Ministry. The sequel will be related later in the section on aviation, &amp;c. (g) Emergency Landing Grounds on the Hasa CoasZ.—-This was the subject of similar unofficial discussions, the upshot of which will be given later. (h) Transit Dues at Bahrein.— Bey mentioned this to Mr. Rendel on the lines indicated in paragraph 52 above. (i) Commercial Debts, Claims, ^.—Conversation took place between Fuad Bey and Mr. Rendel on the unsatisfactory position in regard to the Shell Company’s claim, the claim of the Government of India, and delays in settling the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cable accounts. It was of a general nature only. 63. Before the mission left London, the Secretary of State handed to the Amir and Fuad Bey, respectively, the insignia of an Honorary G.B.E. and an Honorary K.B.E. which the King had been pleased to confer on them. 64. His Majesty’s Minister, who had been retained in London for the mission’s visit, returned to Jedda on the 30th May and was received with every courtesy. His arrival coincided with the first intimation to the Saudi Govern ment regarding the invasion of Ibn Rifada. The relations between His Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia during the remainder of the year were mainly determined by the effects of that affair and its sequel. It is unnecessary to add much to the account given in the section dealing with Transjordan. That business had the paradoxical effect of improving relations, owing to the strong desire of the Saudi Government to make His Majesty’s Government their allies against the Amir of Transjordan. The King received Sir Andrew Ryan with cordiality on the 30th August before they left for Riyadh and London respec tively. The .conversation was in itself too general to have any value, except as a demonstration of friendliness after what had happened earlier in the year. Mr. Hope Gill carried on the work of the Legation until Sir Andrew Ryan again returned to Jedda on the 21st December. 65. A good many other subjects which affect the relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud are dealt with in the relevant sections of this report. Two questions which have been mentioned in preceding reports as standing in the background of those relations remained in abeyance during the year. That of the King’s claim to Maan and Aqaba was not revived. There was no development of any consequence in connexion with the Hejaz Railway. It may be noted that the Amir Abdullah has of late expressed anxiety to see the railway reopened for pilgrim traffic.20 66. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba continued to represent the Saudi Government in London until November, when he went on leave. He was rather more in evidence in diplomatic intercourse than he had previously been, and he exercised a valuable moderating influence in connexion with the incident arising out of the manumission of the slave Bakhit. France and Syria. 67. Little is known of what passed between the Amir Feisal’s mission and the French Government, except that the latter seem to have firmly discouraged a Saudi suggestion that the Alexandria Quarantine Board ought not to concern itself with the pilgrimage. The mission lunched with M. Doumer on the day of his assassination, and Fuad Bey interrupted his stay in London to fly to Paris for the funeral. 68. Ratifications w~ere exchanged in Jedda on the 24th June of the Treaty of Friendship between France and Saudi Arabia and the separate convention in regard to Syria and the Lebanon, both of which had been signed on the 10th November, 1931. The texts were published in the Mecca paper Umm-al-Qura on the 12th August. The effect of the General Treaty was generally similar to . that of the Anglo-Saudi Treaty of Jedda. As had been foreseen, there was no I article about the slave trade. In certain respects the French appeared to have I obtained more than Sir G. Clayton, e.y., a most-favoured-nation clause. The treaty was for ten years, to be prolonged for a similar period, failing express denunciation. The convention in regard to Syria and the Lebanon proved to be not, as had been supposed, a commercial agreement, but a more general instrument in three parts, the first of which was broadly on the same lines as the General Treaty with France. The second dealt with tribal matters. The third reserved commercial and economic matters for further negotiation, but general rules were laid down regarding the caravan trade and the non-collection of dues by tribal chiefs. This convention was for seven years, after which it may be denounced at six months’ notice at any time. 69. Ihe Irench Charge d’Affaires had to occupy himself in the early summer with the case of a small vessel under the French flag which was arrested on suspicion at Wejh in the first stages of the Ibn Rifada affair. He got little satisfaction, but the vessel was eventually brought to Jedda and released. 70. M. Maigret visited Taif from the 13th to 15th August, an event remarkable in the recent history of the Corps diplomatique of Jedda, as no other non-Moslem foreign representative has been allowed to go there under Ibn Saud’s regime. It may be mentioned in this connexion that the Saudi Government are understood to have laid down general rules regarding visits to Taif by members ° u -°i reign 1 I ^ lsslons ’ whether Moslem or non-Moslem, the strict enforcement of which would amount to a temporary deprivation of diplomatic privilege and 71. M. Maigret’s visit to Taif excited curiositv nnd cmv A n OA In loin n-P * Italy.21 their recognition (of Ibn Sand) did not involve any admission that they accepted the Saudi point of view in regard to Asir. It was stated that this had been explained to the Amir Feisal during his stay in Rome, in the course of which ratifications of the two treaties were exchanged on the 22nd April. The Embassy gained the impression that the Italian Foreign Office were allowing the Asir question to remain dormant in the hope that it would settle itself. 73. Space does not admit of a full account of the two treaties. They contained no less than four most-favoured-nation clauses. The Italian Govern- , ment had given way to the Saudi objection to any mention in the treaties of co-operation in the suppression of the slave trade, and they expressly agreed in an exchange of letters not to claim in virtue of most-favoured-nation treatment the right to manumit and repatriate slaves in the same way as £&lt; a third Power,” i.e., Great Britain. They salved their consciences by a rather ingenious combinazione expressed in a further exchange of letters. It was recorded on the Italian side that the Italian Government wished Ibn Saud to assume the obligation of co-operating with them in the suppression of the slave trade, and that they also desired for their representative in Jedda the power to manumit and repatriate slaves making spontaneous application. The Saudi note declared that, since his arrival in the Hejaz, Ibn Saud had exerted himself to prevent the importation of slaves into his territory, with the result that it might be said that for several years no person had been able to import them. It added that the Saudi Government would spontaneously persevere in this line of action; and, as regards manumission, that they were pursuing the highest Islamic ideals, but could not grant the power desired by the Italians, as the matter was one of domestic concern. 74. Apart from the ratification of the treaties, the visit of the Saudi mission to Italy had no political importance, but it was well staged and led to a little business in motor cars. In May the Italian Government transformed their mission in Jedda into a Legation and appointed as Minister a gentleman of practically no previous experience in the East. M. de Peppo arrived in Jedda on the 25th September and presented his credentials to the Amir Feisal, in the King’s absence, two days later. 75. Friendship with the Imam Yahya remains the corner stone of Italian policy in South-Western Arabia. Ibn Saud’s suspicion of this policy was stimulated in the latter part of the year by the tolerance shown in Eritrea to the members of the Dabbagh conspiracy, who had made much use of Massawa and had connexions in Asmara. His Government were perturbed by a report in August that Signor Grandi and the Egyptian Premier had been 'discussing the situation in the Hejaz. The King’s resentment was naturally inflamed by the actual outbreak of rebellion in Asir early in November, and he may have leant to the belief, held in some other quarters, that Italy had a finger in that pie. There is no reason to credit this, but the Italians seem to see no reason why they should not extend hospitality to anti-Saudians while Ibn Saud harbours the Senussi. A distinct breeze blew up between the two Governments towards the end of i December over the proceedings of an Italian sloop which went to Jizan on the ! 21st December and played about in Asir territorial waters for some days. The Saudi Government protested strongly, but allowed themselves to be placated by explanations, in which, if the Saudi version can be trusted, the Italian Govern ment once more avoided asserting a position in regard to the King’s sovereingty over Asir, but would appear to have acquiesced in it as at least a practical hard fact. Netherlands. f here is little to record under this head except that early in the year the Saudi Government engaged a Dutch financial adviser (see paragraph 126), and that at the end of the year the Netherlands Charge d’Affaires in Jedda was very displeased with Saudi tergiversations over a question relative to the repatriation of Javanese destitutes. The existence of large numbers of these in Mecca had confronted the Netherlands Government with a problem which private benevolence in Java seemed likely to solve. The continued decline in the [8544] n 1122 pilgrimage from the Dutch East Indies was a severe blow to the finances of the Saudi Government in 1932. Despite their efforts to stimulate the flow of pilgrims by propaganda, the numbers in 1933 promised to be very much smaller still. 77. Nothing of interest is known regarding any business side to the Saudi mission’s visit to Holland. The only other matter to note is one not strictly relevant to the affairs of Saudi Arabia, viz., that it appears to be becoming ^re settled practice for the Netherlands representative in Jedda to pay an annual’*' visit to Sana. M. van der Meulen went there in the course of an extensive tour in 1931. M. Adriaanse went again in the spring of 1932 to deliver Queen Wilhelmina’s reply to a letter from the Imam, and was to go again early in 1933 for a similar purpose. Soviet Russia. 'f 78. The references made to Ibn Sand’s relations with Soviet Russia during the Saudi mission’s stay in London are recorded in paragraph 62 (e). When the mission reached the Russian frontier it was greeted by brass bands which played the “ Internationale ” and various Arabian airs. Its reception in Moscow was duly ceremonious, but no great prominence was given to the visit in the press apart from an article in the Izvestiya on post-war developments in the Hejaz. The mission travelled through Transcaucasia on its way to Persia, and the Amir in his final thank-you telegram referred to the special impression made on its members “ by the oil derricks and the technique of getting oil, a product so beneficial to humanity.” 79. During the Ibn Rifada episode, the Russian Minister in Jedda appeared deliberately to avoid contact with the British Legation. About the same time M. Turakoulov seemed to be engaged in negotiations with the Saudi Government, probably with a view to a commercial understanding and a quid pro quo for the removal of restrictions on Russian trade in the shape of a loan (compare paragraph 62 (e)). There is no evidence that he achieved any definite result, nor has the Soviet Government so far got a penny for the benzine, &amp;c., supplied to Ibn Saud under a special arrangement in 1931. The Russian Legation appears, however, to devote pains to the cultivation of Saudi official circles. The non-Moslem, who acted for the Minister during a longish absence on leave early in the year, was seen playing football with the Amir Feisal in February, and the Minister himself almost always uses Arab head-dress. 80. The Soviet Government may be expected to persevere in their efforts to obtain a commercial understanding with the Saudi Government. Their interest in trade in the Red Sea was illustrated by the publication in their official trade journal in December 1931 of a special article on the foreign trade of the Hejaz. They may also be expected to do anything they can to discredit Great Britain in . the eyes of Ibn Saud. The Ibn Rifada affair provided the opportunity for a I calumnious article in the Izvestiya of the 21st June on alleged British intrigues I against him. Egypt. 81. There is no indication of progress towards a rapprochement between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In June 1932 the Acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs, speaking confidentially to Sir Andrew Ryan, accused Hafiz Amer Bey, the Egyptian consul in Jedda, of being implicated in the general plot against Ibn Saud, and in the earlier conversations regarding the Ibn Rifada affair he used very hot language about the unfriendly attitude of Egypt. He indeed spoke of breaking off relations. The sedative language of Sir Andrew Ryan, and the measures taken by the Egyptian Government to prevent assistance reaching the rebels from their territory, induced a calmer mood. It is interesting to note on the other side that, when the Egyptian Government conceived doubts as to the legal propriety of some of their measures in regard to shipping, their motive would appear to have been partly political. They were apprehensive of seeming to recognise Ibn Saud. The collapse of Ibn Rifada, while the legal question was being considered, fortunately obviated a continuance of the measures. 82. There was probably no foundation for Sheikh Yussuf Yasin’s accusa tion against the Egyptian consul. The latter is, however, avowedly hostile to the Saudi regime and is unlikely to be an instrument of rapprochement. He returned to Jedda after a very long absence in June, but left again in November and was23 absent up to the end of the year. Reference is made elsewhere to the suspicion engendered in Saudi minds by a report in August that the Egyptian Prime Minister had discussed the situation in the Hejaz with Signor Grandi. Turkey. * 83. In January the Turkish representative in London consulted the Foreign Office on a request by the Saudi Government for the loan of Turkish pilots and mechanics to help to develop their air service and for a military mission to help similarly with the army. Ferit Bey was informed in February that His Majesty’s Government saw no reason why Turkey should not accede to this request. The matter seems to have been pursued during the visit of the Amir Feisal’s mission to Angora. The Amir placed an order for 100 rifles of Turkish make and two mitrailleuses, and arrangements were made for the visit of two Turkish officers to the Hejaz to inspect and repair some old Turkish cannon. It was also arranged then or later that a party of Saudi youths should be sent to Turkey for aerial and military studies. 84. The general reception of the Saudi mission in Angora seems to have been very cordial, and the Amir Feisal was given unusual opportunities of observing Turkish military resources. The promised Turkish officers arrived in Jedda in December, but their mission appears to have produced little result. They are said not to have been allowed near the old cannon and to have been disappointed at finding that the party of students to be sent to Turkey would consist of from ten to fifteen young men only. Persia. 85. There would appear to have been no important development in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Persia in 1932. The only event worth mentioning is a visit to Jedda in October of the new Persian flotilla of six motor gunboats on its way, complete with Persian officers and Italian instructors, to the Persian Gulf. A fghanistan. 86. An Afghan mission headed by Ahmad Shah Khan, a cousin of King Nadir Shah, arrived in Jedda on the 17th March, bent both on pilgrimage and on political business. It negotiated a treaty, which was signed on the 5th May, two days after a formal reception of the mission. It is worthy of note that the Saudi Government arranged that both the reception and the signature of the treaty should take place in Jedda, on the ground that Mecca was no place for diplomatic ceremonies. The treaty had not been ratified up to the end of the year. 87. The Afghan mission also bought a house in Mecca to serve as a hostel for pilgrims, and the Afghan Government created in 1932 a small medical establishment for the benefit of their pilgrims. 88. Some emotion was caused shortly after the pilgrimage by the execution of an Afghan pilgrim, who had been convicted by a specially constituted court of having stolen pieces of the Black Stone and of the cover of the Kaba. The Afghan Government are not known to have intervened. Other Countries. 89. There is little to record about the relations of Saudi Arabia with other foreign countries in 1932. Poland made some pathetically inept attempts to get the balance of the money due for the arms, &amp;c., supplied in 1930. Denmark made, through His Majesty’s Government, further efforts, which were unsuccessful, to elucidate the circumstances of the disappearance of Knud Holmboe in 1931. The United States of America did not follow up in any way their recognition of Ibn Saud in May 1931, but their citizen Mr. Twitched continued to play a role, which will be mentioned elsewhere, in plans for the economic development of Saudi Arabia.24 (C) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 90. During the greater part of 1932 the Saudi Government were too greatly preoccupied with internal affairs to devote much attention to general international affairs, even were they more disposed than before to depart from their attitud^^ of aloofness in regard to most matters of general international concern. 91. In the domain of health Saudi Arabia took one important step forward by acceding in January 1932 to the Rome Convention of 1907. This decision was in accordance with the suggestion made informally by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the l nited Kingdom in 1931. Nothing more was heard of the Saudi idea of adhering to the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, with reservations. In due course the Government despatched their Director-General of Public Health to attend the October meeting of the Office International at Paris. In November and December the Mecca Umm-al-Qura published a certain account about the 1907 and 1926 conventions, emphasising inter alia the fact that a report on sanitary conditions in the Hejaz made some years ago by a League of Nations committee related to conditions under the Hashimite regime. Reference is made in paragraph 67 to the attitude which the Amil Feisal’s mission appears to have taken up in Paris in regard to the Alexandria Quarantine Board. 92. The Saudi Government did not revert during the year to the question of acceding to the Arms Traffic Convention, in which they had previously shown so much interest. 93. The Saudi Government made no move of any kind regarding possible membership of the League of Nations. They, however, appointed their Minister in London to represent them at the Disarmament Conference and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba spent quite a little of his time at Geneva. The statement furnished by his Government regarding their military forces, &amp;c., is dealt with in Section V. On the 27th July the Acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs surprised Sir Andrew Ryan by tackling him on the subject of President Hoover’s then recent disarmament proposals. His idea seemed to be that the Saudi Government would be very ready to follow Mr. Hoover’s lead if they could be assured of security on their northern frontiers. Sir Andrew Ryan smelt a rat and suggested that the Saudi Government would do better to obtain the views of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom through their Minister in London, though he offered to submit to the Secretary of State any points which Sheikh Yussuf might like to set forth in an unofficial letter. He reported the conversation to the Foreign Office, after which nothing further was heard of the matter in Jedda. 94. The Umm-al-Qura announced in November that the Saudi Government had been invited to take part in the “ International Economic Conference which is intended to be held in London.” The reference was presumably to the proposed World Economic Conference, but the apparently premature statement in the Umm-al-Qura is not understood by the Legation in Jedda, 95. On the 8th April the United States Embassy in London informed the Foreign Office of the accession of Saudi Arabia to the 1928 treaty for the renunciation of war, known as the Kellogg Pact. 96. On the 11th January the Saudi Government informed His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires that they had appointed their Minister in London to attend, as an observer, the Fifth International Conference of Local Authorities In March they expressed regret at their inability to participate in the International Conference on Commercial Education. 97. An unsuccessful effort was made in 1930 to induce Ibn Saud to allow the International Locust Bureau of Damascus to send a scientific mission to investigate the extent and nature of the breeding grounds of the Nejdian locust. Arising out of this it was suggested to the Saudi Government in 19'31 that they should accede to the convention of the 20th May, 1926, under which the bureau was created. They declined this suggestion. In July 1932 His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda was instructed to communicate to them a copy of the fourth Report of the Committee on Locust Control of the Economic A.dvisory Council, if he thought25 IS5 it would serve any useful purpose. He did so without much hope and subsequently impressed on Fuad Bey Hamza the importance from an international point of view of joint efforts to combat plagues of locusts. He admitted that it would be difficult for the Saudi Government to organise and complete machinery for reporting on the occurrence and movement of locusts, but urged that any reports all would be of value. Following on this Mr. Hope Gill supplied buad Bey “■^'^ith a concise memorandum showing the sort of information that would be useful and Fuad Bey undertook to forward any information that could be obtained. In due course his Ministry informed the Legation that flying locusts had appeared in small quantities in ihe Nabt district north of Yanbu. 98. It is hoped that too much ridicule will not be heaped on this mouse-like result of the mountainous labour over locusts. In general it may be said that, while the progress of the Saudi Government towards participation in inter national effort on modern lines is slow and painful, the bald facts strung together in this sub-section suggest some faint hope for the future. Unfortunately no information is available regarding the visit of the Saudi mission to Geneva at the end of April. (D) Treaties. 99. The appendix to this report brings up to date the list of Saudi treaties given in Appendix I of the annual report for 1931. HI.— Internal Affairs. General Situation. 100. Ibn Saud was in Nejd at the beginning of the year. He went to Hasa at the beginning of January and stayed until the 7th February. It may be noted that although he had accepted in June 1931 the pronouncement of the Ulema of Nejd that annual celebrations of his accession were un-Islamic, it was nevertheless celebrated in Jedda, though not in Mecca, on the 8th January, 1932. It was, indeed, celebrated officially under the auspices of the Amir Feisal though with less ceremony than in the two previous years. The King himself returned to Mecca on the 7th April in time for the pilgrimage, which he never misses. He intended to go back to Nejd after a short stay in the Hejaz, but was delayed by the Ibn Rifada affair. He summered at Taif from the 22nd May until the 6th September, when he went back to Riyadh for the remainder of the year. 101. The general malaise which prevailed in the Hejaz during all the latter part of 1931 continued into the early part of 1932. Misery was rife among the northern tribes. The towns remained depressed and dissatisfied. A poorei pilgrimage than ever brought no comfort. Early in the year there were the usual rumours of trouble elsewhere. They were as usual exaggerated. No disorder occurred in the Shammar area. The principal tribes involved on the rebel side in the insurrection of 1929, the Mutair and the Ajman, were sullen but inactive. The only regions in which definite trouble is known to have occurred were that south of Hufuf, where a punitive force was sent against the Murra to round up criminals (who duly had their arms and legs cut oft) and the Najran aiea north of Asir, where the disaffection was considerable enough to necessitate the despatch of forces under the well-known leader Khalid-bin-Luwey, Amir of Khurma. There was probably some simmering in Asir itself, but on the whole the internal situation in Saudi Arabia was uneasy rather than disquieting. 102 Then came Ibn Rifada, whose adventure must now be looked at from the Saudi side. The rebel force which crossed the frontier in the night of the 20th-21st May did not probably amount to more than 250 men, who may have been joined by others at their first resting place just inside the frontier. They went on to Haql some 30 miles south of Aqaba, and this was for some time the principal rebel base. By the end of May the numbers had grown to some 500; by the middle of June to some 1,000, of whom over two-thirds were said to have come from over the border; by the end of June to anything from 1,000 to 1,500. These forces were ill-found in every way. The next most important leader after Ibn Rifada, one of the Abu Tuqeyqa family, was soon at loggerheads with the chief. Local adherents began to slip away when they found that there was no money and little food. British action was making it increasingly impossib e to get these or further recruits from across the frontier. The rebel chiefs might have expectedto attract local support because of their family connexions, for Ibn Rifada was of the Eilli tribe and his people were important at Wejh, while the Abu Tuqeyqas had a similar connexion with the country about Dhaba. Had it been possible to make a rapid dash for these ports or even for Muweyla instead of hanging round further north, the rebellion might have had more success. As it was, the furthest points reached on the coast were just east of the southern end of the Gulf of Aqaba and the furthest reached at all was Jebel Shar, a little inland fro^*--' the road between Muweyla and Dhaba, where the main force was cut to pieces on the 30th July. 103. Why was an affair so small in itself, and so ill-organised, of such tremendous importance to Ibn Sand? The general reasons are given in para graph 7 above. The King could take no risks. The number of the Ikhwan concentrated at A1 Ula is unknown. It was anything from 4,000 to 10,000, of whom only a portion went to the front. Forces were also sent from Taif, Mecca and Jedda, and the Hejazi navy, consisting of one armed dhow, proceeded up the coast. Large numbers of Ikhwan, some thousands strong, assembled at Taif also, to be available in the event of trouble elsewhere. The King was prepared for every contingency. When he had smashed Ibn Rifada, he enforced the lesson to his enemies by ordering the extermination of all surviving rebels and all who had helped them. 104. None of the other elements that might have risen moved in the summer. The Amir of Taima was disaffected and was in communication with the Amir Abdullah, but he was more frightened of attack by the Ikhwan than disposed to go into open revolt. The King had also to reckon, however, with the possibility of political disaffection in places like Jedda and Mecca. He had been displeased with the Hejazi notables in 1931. He had conceived a fear of their political tendencies and a dislike of their corruption. In 1932, even before Ibn Rifada’s incursion, he had shown his displeasure by trenchant utterances, notably by a speech addressed to the leading men of the two towns before leaving for Taif on the 22nd May. A note of menace pervaded the pious exhortations to which he is addicted His military preparations to deal with Ibn Rifada were followed by arrests in Mecca, including that of the Syrian ex-officer Faudhi Bey-al- Kawokji, who had been employed as Director-General of Military Organisation, but had fallen into disgrace in 1931, possibly owing to the suspicion of a connexion with the Hashimites. On the night of the 28th June a large number of persons were arrested in Jedda. Some of these were, like Faudhi Bey, deported to Nejd. It was feared in high circles that the younger townsmen might be infected with subversive political ideas. For a time the game of football was discouraged, not because it was a game, but because the clubs might be foci of disloyalty. 105. The defeat of Ibn Rifada relieved all this tension. In the course of the autumn the deportees were allowed to return, and the playing of football was again allowed, subject to certain restrictions on clubs. The townsmen were very ready to declare their loyalty to the victorious King. They tumbled over each other to sign the petitions in September asking that the unity of the kingdom should be affirmed by the adoption of the new name of Saudi Arabia. This movement was said to have originated in meetings at the Taif residence of Sheikh Abdullah-al- Fadhl, the vice-president of the Legislative Council. The list of signatories of the first petition was significantly headed by the name of Fuad Bey Hamza, who is, first and last, an Arab Nationalist. Among the other petitions, of which over 700 were said to have been sent to Riyadh, were many from all classes of townsmen, leading citizens and guilds of craftsmen, as well as those from Hejazi tribes and from Nejdis. The movement was represented as being the direct outcome of the stimulation of national consciousness and loyalty by recent events. What could the King do but defer to the wishes of 'a unanimous people, unanimous in appearance, although the information published about the Nejdi petitions was scanty and there was no mention of petitions from Asir? The decree was issued on the 18th September and the date for the adoption of the new name was fixed for the 22nd September. 106. Except that the public treasury was bankrupt, all seemed to be well with Ibn Saud. Trouble was brewing, however, in Asir. The King had sent thither a new Governor-General earlier in the year, one Fahd-bin-Zuair. He sent a posse of officials in June to reorganise the Administration; among other thingsto make Asir pay. He doubtless knew then, or if not then, he learnt later, of the machinations of the Dabbaghs and other outsiders to stir up revolt in Asir in collusion with certain tribes and certain members of the Idrisi family. Indeed, he prevented one of these, Ali-al-Idrisi, from going back from the Hejaz to his country and sent him to Riyadh instead. He probably thought, however, that the mt de feat of Ibn Rifada would dismay the conspirators, whose original plan was that _e revolt in Asir should synchronise with, and slightly precede, the invasion from the north. 107. Eahd-bin-Zuair appears to have been rough with the Idrisi. He probably saw more clearly than the King how things were moving in Asir itself. It appears from correspondence subsequently published that as early as the 26th September he and Ibn Madhi, the inspector of the province, began to telegraph alarmist reports. The King’s replies enjoined on them to conciliate the Idrisi. The latter himself sent at least one loyal telegram just before the end of October, but he complained of the deportation of his relative, Ali, and he had grievances against Ibn Zuair. The King was ready to believe that the latter had mismanaged things and sent a mission to investigate. He also began to send forces to Asir, though he still did not despair of a settlement. Before his mission could reach the spot, the Idrisi had put himself at the head of the rebels. They took Jizan, the seat of the Saudi Governorate, on the 6th November and interned the Amir and the other Saudi officials. Even after this, the Idrisi continued to profess loyalty and to have no grievance, except against Ibn Zuair. The outrage was, however, too patent. The Saudi forces moved and retook Jizah on the 17th November. Their tenure of it was insecure and the country inland was up. The King poured further forces southward. First and last, there were apparently three expeditions, one along the coast, one further inland under Khalid-bin-Luwey and one from Nejd, where large contingents of Ikhwan were called out, under the King’s nephew, Khalid-bin-Muhammad. Ibn Musaid, the Governor of Hail, was despatched to Abha with the intention of making him Governor-General of Asir. 108. These events filled some weeks. The troops under Khalid-bin-Luwey reached Sabya shortly before the 23rd December, having lost their leader on the way, from illness, it was said. On the 25th December Fuad Bey Hamza told Sir Andrew Ryan that the authority of the Government had been restored as far as a line running inland from Madhaya, a small port some 25 kilom. south of Jizan. A communique of the 30th December claimed that the majority of the revolted tribesmen had submitted within a period of grace allowed early in the month and that the only tribes still in revolt were the Masariha and part of the Beni Shubayl, with whom were the Idrisi and his people. According to subsequent information, the troops at Sabya and Jizan, having joined forces, moved forward on the 28th December, took Madhaya next day, swept the littoral as far as the frontier, and advanced on Abu Arish on the 30th December. It may be added in anticipation of the report for 1933 that they occupied that place on the 1st January. The Government claimed that the revolt was effectively ended and that it only remained to deal with unimportant remnants. The Idrisi was, however, still at large in the mountains, and it was not known how formidable he and his supporters might still prove to be in the inland area. It was not known either what had become of the third force sent from Nejd under the command of the King’s nephew. 109. The longanimity which Ibn Saud displayed towards the Idrisi throughout the earlier stages of this business was remarkable. It may be that he realises the difficulty of holding Asir permanently in defiance of the Idrisi family and the tribes which support it. It may have been part of a larger policy of conciliation, of which there was other evidence in the latter part of the year. It was noted that the King made definite attempts in the autumn to mitigate the hostility of the Mutair and the Ajman by generous treatment, and tried to attract back to his territory chiefs sojourning in exile in Iraq. Again, when the Beni Atiya re-entered Saudi Arabia in the circumstances already described, he did not fall upon them as some had feared he might, but seemed anxious to treat with their leaders.Constitutional Development and Administration. 110. An undated decree, published in Mecca on the 15th January, 1932, announced the creation of a Council of Ministers consisting of a president, who was to control four named departments, the Under-Secretary (or Deputy-Minister as Fuad Bey Hamza prefers to call himself) for Foreign Affairs, the head of the Finance Department, and the vice-president of the Legislative Council. president of the council was to be ex officio Viceroy in the King’s absence. TUj decree was obviously drawn up with reference to a particular person’s position, that of the King’s second surviving son, the Amir Feisal. The Amir had previously held the offices of Viceroy and Minister for Foreign Affairs. The four departments now placed under his control were the existing Viceroy’s office, and the Ministries for Foreign Affairs, the Interior, and War. Each of these three Ministries was described as a Wazara, which may be translated Ministry or full Ministry. The other members of the council were described by the title of Wakil or deputy, which may be interpreted as meaning either a person acting for the head of a department or the head of a department acting on behalf of the Sovereign. In effect the decree brought into existence a council of four persons having apparently joint responsibility and comprising one full Minister with several portfolios and three others of inferior status. It is doubtful incidentally whether it was seriously intended that even the Amir Feisal should be Minister of War, a post the only effective incumbent of which always has been and is still the King. 111. This decree was the last up to date of a series of enactments modifying the Constitution conferred by Ibn Saud on the Hejaz, as such, in 1926. They were collected and ably reviewed in a despatch addressed by Mr. Hope Gill to the Foreign Office on the 18th May, 1932. His study of the matter revealed a complete lack of cohesion in the patchwork. In August there was a new development when it was announced that the Department of Finance had been raised to the status of a Wazara, the head of which was to be Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. It was expressly stated that he would be Minister of Finance for the whole of Ibn Sand’s dominions, with a Wakil, his brother, to assist him. This singular constitutional development had an appearance of even greater political significance, inasmuch as it conferred upon Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, a henchman of the King, but a notorious enemy of the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza, a title hitherto reserved for the Amir. 112. Only a few weeks later the King decreed the union of his dominions under the new name of Saudi Arabia, in circumstances described above. The decree contained two other important provisions, namely, that, while existing arrangements were maintained provisionally, the united country was to be endowed with a single Constitution in due course, and a rule of succession to the throne was to be instituted. No further public announcement was made up to the end of the year, but it was understood that the King had designated his eldest surviving son, the Amir Saud, to succeed him, and had taken steps to ensure the acceptance of this decision by the members of the family. 113. Although these experiments in Constitution-making, which have been largely the work of that bright young Syrian, Fuad Bey Hamza, are interesting, they have had little effect on the administration of the country. The King still runs it with a motley collection of underlings, of whom those most conspicuous at the centre of things are his very powerful Minister of Finance, his ingenious Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs, his factotum Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, and, perhaps, the Vice-President of the Legislative Assembly, Sheikh Abdullah-al- Fadhl. A curious recruit was added late in the year in the person of Muwaffaq Bey A1 Alusi, who came to Jedda in 1931 as a member of Nuri Pasha’s delegation, fell foul of the Iraqi Government later, and was appointed legal adviser to the Saudi Government in due course. The principal posts in the provincial Administration are held by relatives or connexions of the King. His eldest son runs Nejd proper, and, perhaps, more. His cousin, Abdullah-bin-Jiluwi, is Governor, and a strong Governor, of Hasa. Another relative, Abdul Aziz-bin-Musaid was Governor of Hail and was chosen late in 1932 to be Governor-General of Asir. Two Sudairis, relatives of the King’s mother, have governorates in the country adjoining Transjordan. The other governorates are mostly held by Nejdis. In some places hereditary rights seem to be respected.29 Anaiza has a special status under the King and independent of the more extensive governorate of Buraida, to which it is geographically close. The Governor of Taima, of which a good deal was heard in 1932, seems to be still a semi independent local personage. One important change was made in 1932. The old Governor of Jedda, who was the principal local merchant and retained from King Hussein’s time the old Turkish title of Kaimakam, died, and was replaced a Nejdi official of high family in Anaiza, with the same title of Amir as is borne by other Governors. IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. Finance. 114. The finances of Saudi Arabia went from bad to worse again in 1932, although it is only fair to say at the outset that some attempts at economy were made. In January the Umm-al-Qura published what purported to be a budget for the lunar year beginning the 12th December, 1931. It had only one side, an expenditure side, which contemplated disbursements to the total amount of 105,956,086 or 106,442,544 piastres miri, according to whether an obvious discrepancy was due to a mistake in items or in addition. It was assumed in the covering regulation that receipts would balance expenditure. 115. The budget was for the Hejaz only. It allocated 45,100,000 piastres for Royal and military expenditure. This may be taken to be the King’s share in the revenues of the Hejaz. Although the Hejaz gets rule and security as a quid fro quo, the allocation represents in the main, from a financial point of view, a heavy drain on the revenues of the Hejaz in favour of Nejd. It may be supposed that it is a first charge on any available receipts, a fact which doubtless explains constant reports that the bulk of the latter are remitted to Riyadh. Otherwise the budget must be regarded as eye-wash. It is impossible to estimate the actual revenue. An attempt made by the Legation in March to calculate it approximately, suggested a figure of £619,000 gold for the current year, but there was reason later to suppose that customs revenue had been put at too high a conjectural figure. 116. Nothing precise can be said of the finances of Nejd and its Dependencies. How poor they are on the receipts side may be gauged by the report that Muhammad-at-Tawil, the head of the commission of reorganisation sent to Hasa in 1930, undertook to produce 11 lacs of rupees from customs there and failed to do so. 117. The Hejazi budget allocated 16,500,000 piastres for the payment of debts. It had been understood that 25 per cent, of the total revenue would be devoted to this purpose. In explanation of the smaller proportion borne to the total by the figure shown in the budget, Fuad Bey Hamza naively explained to Sir Andrew Ryan that the discrepancy was not so great as might appear, as some of the items, including that for debt redemption, were at gold rate, while others were at riyal rate. In any case, no effort was made during the year to pay off important outstanding debts. In some cases the claimants had been induced to accept promissory notes falling due in November 1932. In others, the claimants continued to be allowed rebates on customs duty in part payment of the sums due to them. This latter system was generalised by a regulation published on the 17th June. It laid down that debts regarding which an agreement had been made with the creditors would be dealt with under such agreements, but that other debts, with certain exceptions otherwise provided for, would be discharged by issuing drafts on customs which would be accepted in payment of 25 per cent, of the duty on new goods. Creditors other than import merchants were to designate import merchants to receive and handle drafts on their behalf. This created a discount market for drafts on customs, which was naturally a very poor one. The drafts were said to be changing hands towards the end of the year at something like one-third of their face value. 118. The regulation just mentioned appeared at first sight to get right away from the system contemplated at the beginning of the year of setting aside a stated amount of revenue for the redemption of floating debt. They were brought into ingenious harmony by a circular issued to all creditors, including His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, in November. It treated30 drafts on customs accepted in lieu of duty as creating a debt by the Treasury to the customs revenue, repayable from the contents of the debt chest. A dexterous calculation showed that the two more or less balanced, leaving, however, enough in hand to pay 5 per cent, interest for a year on the sums still due, which must stand over for that period. The Government were full of regrets for a past which they attributed to world conditions, and full of hope for the future. The promissoi notes due in November were dishonoured about the same time. 119. The claims in which His Majesty’s Government are directly interested, viz., the debt of about £31,500 for arms supplied to Ibn Saud by the Government of India in 1929 and a smaller sum due in respect of the cost of the McDonnell enquiry in 1930, remained unsettled during the year. The monthly settlements with the Eastern Telegraph Company were always behindhand, but the balance outstanding at the end of the year was rather less than at the end of 1931. The formidable dispute over the misappropriation by the Saudi authorities of the Shell Company’s stock of benzine in September 1931 was finally settled in November 1932 by the conclusion of a fresh agreement between the Government and the company. It provided for the issue of two drafts for the amount due, to be met by rebates of 50 per cent, on future sums payable to the Government in respect of customs duty and quarantine dues respectively, and it assured to Shell (on paper at least) a share in the local market for benzine. 120. The Legation continued to be bombarded throughout the year with petitions from British chauffeurs, chiefly Somalis and Sudanese, who could not get paid arrears of wages due by Royal princes, the Government or Government- controlled companies. The Government fobbed some of these off in June with payment of one-third in full satisfaction of their claims. Many other claims were outstanding at the end of the year. 121. The total floating debt of the Government is relatively small, though it reduces them to so many miserable expedients. Mr. Hope Gill estimated the total of important known outstandings at the end of December, not including arrears of salaries and other such individually small items, at £219,200 gold or over. One of the most important creditors is Mr. Philby, acting on behalf of his own company, Marconi’s and Standard Oil, whose claims were put respectively at £20,000, £15,000 (increasing as further instalments fall due) and £15,000. The first figure includes debts for Ford cars, supplied by Sharqieh (Limited) as merchants, not as agents. Mr. Philby, however, pursues his own methods and does not seek the assistance of the Legation. 122. There has been no substantial change in the monetary situation, which was described at length in the report for 1931. The approximate rates at the end of 1922 were :— No progress seems to have been made with the plan conceived in 1931 for rehabilitating the riyal by generalising its use throughout Ibn Saud’s dominions. 123. The Saudi Government continued to cast about in various directions in 1932 for a loan. This was one of the principal objects of the mission to Europe. The results of its efforts in London are described in paragraph 62 (b), and the supposed outcome of flirtation with Moscow in paragraph 79. Similar efforts were presumably made elsewhere, but no one, with the possible exception of the Russians, seems to have been prepared to help. 124. Notwithstanding his urgent need of money, Ibn Saud was very indignant over a press report in March that he was getting a loan of £500,000 from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in return for certain concessions, including aerial facilities. He was, in fact, about to ask for a loan, and he had professed readiness to consider the question of facilities for aircraft on the Hasa coast, but he feared that, if he were believed to have allowed the two subjects to be connected, his enemies would make out that he was selling sovereignty for lucre. He was equally indignant over suggestions that he exploited the Hejaz. He adverted personally to both these matters in his speech to notable pilgrims in April. He denied the loan rumour and rejected the £ gold 1 =20 riyals. £ sterling 1 = 13| riyals. £ Egyptian = 14 riyals. 20 rupees = £ gold 1.31 accusation that he squeezed money out of the Hejaz. £t The money of the Hejaz,” he cried, £&lt; is for the people of the Hejaz, and I protect and defend them. I declare openly that, if any one of the Moslem Kings, princes or merchants wants to do a benevolent deed for the Moslems in this country, he is warmly welcome, provided he does not violate the honour of our country, neither does he affect our independence or anything of our religious matters.” * 125. Although the King is more vigorous than precise in his public utterances, it is possible that this passage was an appeal to Moslems to render the assistance of which there was so little prospect from Europe. In May he was visited by the “ Amir ” Habib Lotfallah, who, though not a Moslem, has had his eye on the Hejaz since King Hussein’s time, and by one Abdul Hamid Shadid, said to be a representative of the ex-Khedive of Egypt. There was a financial side to the economic proposals of these and others, which will be mentioned presently. Lotfallah seems to have achieved nothing. At the end of the year it looked as though business might be done with Abbas Hilmi Pasha, who told the Cairo Ahram in December that Ibn Baud had asked him in his capacity as a rich Moslem to help in the finances of his country. There may also be some possibility of help from the Nizam of Hyderabad in return for the privilege of being allowed to restore the Prophet’s birthplace. 126. Early in the year the Saudi Government engaged for one year as financial adviser a Dutchman named van Leeuwen, a retired member of the Netherlands Trading Society’s staff. He arrived in April, went on sick leave in July and returned in November. He writes reports, but does not appear to have any hand in the real finance of the country or even to be admitted to Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s counsels. It was stated in the press in September that recommendations of his in connexion with the Customs Administration had been accepted and would shortly be brought into force, but up to the end of the year no improvement was remarked in the Jedda custom-house. M. van Leeuwen will certainly leave in 1933, and the Saudi Government will be the poorer by his salary without having attempted to make serious use of him. 127. Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman continued during the year to squeeze all the money he could out of as many people as he could get at, but there does not appear to have been any important increase in the legal scales of taxation. Economic Development. 128. There was again much talk in 1932 of economic development in Saudi Arabia, but, as nothing definite materialised, it will suffice to give a very brief account of the more important activities which came to the notice of the Legation, as follows :— (a) The American, Mr. Twitched, returned to the Hejaz on the 18th January from a further prospecting tour in Nejd and Hasa, the most important result of which was that he supported the scheme for the construction of a port at Ras Tanura. In February he busied himself with yet another gold-mine, the Mahd Dhahab, or Cot of Gold, near Medina, on which he reported with imprecise hopefulness. His relations with the King seem to have deteriorated early in the year, as the King found him officiously unwilling to stick to his last as a surveyor and too ready to suggest how things should be done, while Mr. Twitched criticised the lack of competent men to help him and the obstructive and dilatory methods of Saudi officials. He left on the 7th March with his wife and his colleague, Mr. Moseley, who had been prospecting for gold near Taif. The latter faded away for good, but Mr. Twitched was back in May, and was understood to be now in the pay of the Government, not as previously of Mr. Crane. He stayed only a short time, but the Hejaz and its possibilities seem to have bitten him. It was reported at the end of the year that he would return early in 1933 with assistants, not necessarily to work in Government employ, but perhaps on behalf of an American group. (b) The schemes propounded in May by Habib Lotfadah and the ex-Khedive’s agent seem to have been independent, but to have presented a general similarity. They hinged on the idea of creating an Arabian National Bank, with privilege of issue, financial assistance to the Government and the grant by the Government of concessionary rights.32 (c) Mr. Abdul Ghani Ydlibi, the enterprising British-naturalised Syrian head of a small company in Manchester, was in Jedda in February bent on developing his trade in cotton and artificial silk, &amp;c., but also on larger schemes in connexion with oil, railways and anything else. He was associated with Huseyn Aweyni, a Syrian who has been much in Jedda and is intimate with Fuad Bey Hamza. It is interesting to note that these gentlemen seemed to have access to Mr. Twitchell’s reports in their complete and original form. Mr. Ydli sought to engage Mr. Hope Gill’s interest in Jedda and later that of His Majesty’s Government at home. It must be recorded with regret that in London he told a lie. He said that he had shown Mr. Hope Gill an undertaking from Ibn Saud, authorising him to form a syndicate to prospect for gold, oil, petroleum, &amp;c., provided it were all-British. He seems to have represented himself to the Saudi Government as having got the definite support of the Calico Printers’ Association (Limited). Mr. Ydlibi made more than one effort to get in some shape or form the blessing of His Majesty’s Government for his all-British syndicate, but was met with an attitude of reserve. (d) A Dr. S. A. K. Jeelani, of Madras, having made the pilgrimage in 1932. returned later in the year with another Indian to ventilate a scheme for the construction of a railway between Jedda and Mecca. The scheme was based on imperfect and out-of-date data; nor was it clear whether Dr. Jeelani had already got his financial backing in India or hoped to secure it after getting the concession. At the end of the year his negotiations seemed to be advancing towards an agreement very favourable to the Saudi Government, including a little loan, but in January 1933 it looked as though they would fall through. &amp; ( e ) Another scheme was mooted late in the year, with some assistance from the Indian vice-consul, to organise under the auspices of Hyderabadi Indians a textile industry in the Hejaz to give employment to the people of the country, who would learn the arts of spinning and weaving from workers imported from India This was still in project stage at the end of December. weie doubtless other authors of projects, including perhaps Mr. Philby, although he devoted most of the year to crossing the Rub-al-Khali gathering resultant laurels and preparing books. While Die dreamers were dreaming the economic state of Saudi Arabia continued to be depressed It differed so little from that in 1931 that it need not be further enlarged upon. Communications and Ports. 130. The most important development under this head in 1932 was the completion of all the wireless stations which the Marconi Company had undertaken to supply and instal, with the exception of the large fixed station at Kiyadh, which was begun but not finished during the year. When this station is working Ibn Saud will have a network of twenty-two fixed stations, four mobile sets and two portable sets presented to him by Sir F. Humphrys on behalf of His Majesty s Government in 1931. The system will comprise 2 relatively powerfu! stations, 6-kilowatt, at Mecca and Riyadh; 9 ^-kilowatt stations, also available both for telegraphy and telephony, at A1 Ula, Tabuk, Qaf, Skaka Buiaida, Jubail, Qatif, Uqair and Hufuf; and 11 old Telefunken telegraphv stations dating from Turkish times at Jedda, Rabigh, Yanbu, Wejh Dhaba Qunfida and Jizan on the Red Sea Coast, and at Medina, Taif, Hail and Abha m the interior. Pending the completion of the station at Riyadh, one of the mobile sets is used there. .v * tu 1 ' 0 Th f creation of an extensive wireless system is the most sensible thing that Ibn Saud has done m recent years. It has provided at comparatively small expense (all the smaller for the moment as only a small portion of the Marconi Company s bill has been paid) means of rapid communication for administrative and militaiy purposes; to some extent also for private purposes, as public services have been instituted 'pari passu with the completion of the imnortanf new stations. 1 ' !32. There is no important progress to record in the matter of roads postal services or port development. An account is given in paragraph 13 (iii) of the position regarding the proposed motor route from Iraq to Medina; and reference is made elsewhere in this sub-section to the still nebulous projects for a railwav between Jedda and Mecca and a port at Ras Tanura, opposite Bahrein J' 5 ? 33 Commerce. 133. Little can be added to what was said in the report for 1931 regarding the general trade of the Hejaz. The capacity of the Saudi Government as buyeis of goods was greatly limited by the exhaustion of their credit as a result of their conduct in 1931. An index of the position in this respect is afforded by the fact that Sharqieh (Limited), which used to do a good deal of business with the ^jvernment, closed down temporarily when the local managing director, Mr. Philby, went home in the spring. They reopened on his return, but do not seem to be importing anything. The general buying market, on the other hand, seems to have been factitiously stimulated in the summer months, with the result that merchants were heavily overstocked at the end of the year. A number of Jedda merchants bought drafts against gold on Bombay, Cairo and London, apparently to finance purchases. The idea seems to have prevailed, in spite of the absence of all reasonable foundation for it, that the next pilgrimage would be good. There was also the attraction that a substantial part of the duty on newly-imported goods could be paid in drafts on the customs, many of these bought in cheap in the market created in the conditions described in paragraph 117. The operations were all the more significant as they were only those of the smaller firms, as the most important firms do their own banking. V.— Military and Naval Organisation. 134. Military matters are touched on generally in various sections of this report which describe the events of the year in various parts of Ibn Saud s dominions. This section can be confined strictly to what little is known of general organisation. 135. No progress is known to have taken place in the development of the embryo regular army mentioned in the reports for 1930 and 1931. As it was little in evidence in Jedda, no secure judgment can be passed on it, but it may safely be assumed that Hamdi Bey, who continued to be Director-General of Military Organisation during 1932', did little more than carry on. The project of sending a partv of youths to Turkey for military, as well as aerial, study is mentioned in paragraphs 83 and 84. It had not materialised up to the end of the year. 136. The memorandum furnished by the Saudi Government to the League of Nations on the 24th January in connexion with the Disarmament Conference stressed the unique conditions of the country, but supplied, with reserve, the following estimate of the total armed forces. The air force is included here instead of being reserved for the following section, as the figures given under that head provide an index to the value of the document as a whole :— “ Table I .—Total Armed Forces. Number of men ... ... ... ••• 43,437 Number of officers ... ... ... ••• 7J4 Explanatory Notes. (1) The armed forces consist of :— (a) Police, 33 officers and 896 men. {b) Regular troops, 53 officers and 1,780 men. (c) Camel corps, 250 officers and 12,500 men. (d) Coastguards, 14 officers and 211 men. (e) Garrison troops, 350 officers and 26,500 men. (/) Frontier guards, 23 officers and 1,400 men. (g) Air force, 11 officers and 150 men. (2) Military service is not compulsory and men are engaged by voluntary enlistment. In war time, all males between 14 and 65 are liable for active service. (3) In certain units the period of seryice is not specified, the men serving for as long as they wish, or for as long as they give satisfaction. (4) The police, coastguards and regular troops serve under contract for a definite period, which may not exceed five years.34 “ Table II .—A ir Force. Number of aeroplanes ... ... ... ... 9 Total horse-power ... ... ... ... 3,780 ” 137. 1 he reserve with which these figures were given and should be receiv^^^ is all the more justified, as a further table showed the annual expenditure at^*^ total of £930,151 gold, a figure exceeding the total of the Hejazi budget described earlier. It is true that that budget was for the Hejaz only, but the relevant items in it, reckoned at the highest, amount to a total just under £390,000 gold, and it is inconceivable that Nejd and its Dependencies could provide the balance of about £540,000 gold. The statement is interesting as an attempt at classification of the more regular forces, as opposed to Ikhwan and other levies called out on occasion, but it is not merely captious to regard the figures as illusory. The air force is shown as comprising nine aeroplanes, eleven officers and 150 men, and as entailing an expenditure of £12,000 gold per annum. The count of machines can be justified by including the completely worthless aeroplanes left by King Hussein, but when the memorandum was drawn up there was otherwise no air force at all in any true sense of the term. 138. The word “ naval ” is included in the heading because the Saudi Government bought in the spring in Bahrein a sizable dhow, which came to Jedda under its own power and which was, in some sense, armed. It operated on the northern Red Sea coast during the Ibn Rifada affair; ran aground on its outward voyage, but was refloated successfully; and had the capture of one dhow to its credit. There is no other effective navy. VI.— Aviation and Connected Matters. Saudi A rob A ir Force. 139 The derelict state of this force at the end of 1931 was described in the last lepoit. After the failure of the negotiations in that year regarding new British personnel, Ibn Saud turned his eyes elsewhere. A report that he was trymg to recruit airmen in Poland was unconfirmed, but on the 28th January the Turkish Ambassador in London informed the Foreign Office that the Saudi Government had asked the Turkish Government to lend them pilots and machines. ivs stated in paragraph S3, the Ambassador was informed in February that His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom saw no reason why the request should not be complied with. No arrangement seems to have been come to however, between the Turkish and Saudi Governments. The only project known to have been m being at the end of the year was that of sending students to Turkey tor instruction m aerial, as well as military, matters. 140. In May Fuad Bey Hamza broached in London a personal suggestion that His Majesty s Government should reconsider the possibility of sending a Royal Air Force Mission to Saudi Arabia to train native pilots and mechanics. He discussed this informally with Mr. Rendel and Group-Captain Peirse of the Air Ministry, and m due course the suggestion was sympathetically considered r urther examination revealed many difficulties. On the 11th August HG Majesty’s Minister in Jedda communicated to Fuad Bev an unofficial memorandum explaining them and drawing attention to certain points on which the Air Ministry would require further information before the matter could usefully be pursued. Fuad Bey expressed gratitude, but did not revert to the subject during the remaider of the year. 141. The Geiman, Krakowski, who had played a role in connexion with the an foi ce in 1931, got into serious trouble with the Saudi Government in 1932. Indiscretions of his at and near the aerodrome led to his being set upon by soldiers on the 30th April and severely beaten. The German consul was able to give him limited assistance, and he left the country on the 20th M!ay. ML Lowe the last survivor of the original air force, had left in 1931, but came to the notice of the Wion m 1932 owing to the persistent failure of the Saudi authorities to pay his bill for travelling expenses to England.35 / 142. In June the Egyptian company associated with Airwork (Ltd.) consulted the Legation regarding a proposal to demonstrate to Ibn Baud Avro 626, a light aeroplane suitable for training and light military duty. His Majesty’s Government took up a discouraging attitude and the proposal was not pursued. ..nergency Landing grounds on the Hasa Coast. 143. Following on what had passed earlier, this subject was discussed with unsatisfactory results between Sir Andrew Ryan and Fuad Bey in January 1932, and with more hopeful results by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in the course of his conversations with the King and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin at Hufuf towards the end of that month. Mr. Hope Gill followed up Colonel Biscoe’s efforts in friendly conversations with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin early in May, but all that had preceded was superseded later in that month by an exchange of views in London during the visit of the Saudi mission. As a result of informal discussions between Fuad Bey, Mr. Rendel and Group-Captain Peirse, it was decided to address new proposals, more concrete and much more comprehensive than had been made before, to the Saudi Government. It took time to elaborate these, but on the 13th December His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires communicated a memorandum for the King’s consideration stating, with suitable explanations, the desiderata of His Majesty’s Government as follows :— First. —That three emergency landing-grounds and seaplane anchorages be provided on the Hasa coast for the use of service aircraft whenever needed. Second. —That the sites be selected and prepared in consultation with experts of the Royal Air Force, and that they be visited quarterly by such experts and maintained by the local authorities in proper condition in accordance with the experts’ advice. Third. —That service aircraft be permitted to fly along and over the coast-line (but not inland) at any time. Fourth. —That service aircraft be allowed to use these landing-grounds and seaplane anchorages in order to give assistance to aircraft in distress. Fifth. —That this agreement be made valid for five years and be terminable thereafter by either Government subject to six months’ notice being given. 144. It was intimated in the note to the Minister for Foreign Affairs transmitting this memorandum that Llis Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom would be prepared to pay £1,000 a year for the facilities they required, but that the desiderata were minimal and must be treated as a whole. It had been decided to seek facilities for service aircraft only. The note to the Saudi Government stated that it was most unlikely that the highly-engined aircraft used by Imperial Airways would have to make forced landings on the coast, but confidence was expressed that, in this improbable event, the Saudi Government could be relied on to render all necessary succour and to allow assistance to be sent by air. 145. The Saudi Government have at least one landing-ground already at Jinna Island. It was known before 1932 that this had been surveyed by the chief pilot of the Hejazi Air Force. It was reported early in February 1932 that the landing-ground was marked out and fit for use, and that a staff of customs clerks, complete with forms in Arabic and English, were on the spot. Alleged Violations of Saudi Territory by British Aircraft. 146. A few further complaints under this head were received from the Saudi Government in 1932. Some of these referred to alleged flying over the Transjordan frontier and were easily disposed of. three cases of forced landings in Hasa came to the notice of the Legation. In the first it was possible to notify the Saudi Government the day before relief was sent, and their accommodating reply, received after it had actually been sent, was couched in very amicable terms. The second case was reported from Bagdad, but was not the subject of Saudi complaint. In the third a complaint was made and investigated. No service aircraft was involved, but an Imperial Airways machine had lost its way and passed over Jubail. r X&lt;?\36 147. The Saudi Government continue to be very sensitive on the subject of unnotified landing or flying over. It is most desirable that, when such technical use of Saudi territory is unavoidable, the earliest possible notice should be given to the Legation. The favourable reaction mentioned above affords a proof of this. A similarly sympathetic attitude was observed in January 1932 when the Saudi Government were notified, unnecessarily as the event proved, that th^^ territory might have to be entered in the course of a search for missing Ira^i aircraft. VII.— Legislation. 148. The position in regard to past Hejazi legislation was apparently as chaotic at the end of 1932 as in 1931. The vice-president of the Legislative Council told Sir Andrew Ryan on the 27th December that it was hoped to remedy the situation during the coming year. It is possible that the unification of Saudi Arabia may lead in due course to the production of an orderly body of legislation. It may be remarked, incidentally, that one of the difficulties of the Saudi Govern ment is that “ laws ” in the strict sense cannot be made without prejudice to the principle that the religious law of Islam is fixed and all-sufficing. This increases the tendency to produce a medley of decrees, regulations and instructions, usually not even dated. 149. Nevertheless, the Advisory Legislative Council seems to be a very active body. A not very clear but nevertheless interesting survey of its work for the period August 1930 to the 6th May, 1932, was published serially in the Umm-al-Qura in May and June. It appeared to show that the council had busied itself with— 41 draft regulations of one kind or another; 110 sectional budgets of offices, courts, &amp;c.; 1,450 miscellaneous decisions; 60 decisions bearing on economic and social questions; and 1,078 memoranda. The council was reorganised in May, and a new session was opened by the King on or about the 12th May, 1932. 150. Among the more important regulations promulgated in 1932 were the following :— (a) A voluminous commercial code, the publication of which, begun in 1931, was completed in February 1932. (5) A decree, published on the 4th March, regulating the transfer of cases between Sharia Courts and instituting a committee of learned men to hear cases of libellous statements made between claimants. (c) A regulation, published on the 6th May, regarding rents. It established a partial moratorium, inter alia. (d) A regulation, published on the 24th June, regarding an urban census in the Hejaz. (e) A regulation on passports, published on the 1st July. This lays down vexatious rules, including a provision, in principle at least, that every departing traveller must have a guarantor. (/) A regulation on coastal fisheries, publication of which was completed on the 5th August. It lays down comprehensive rules for the control and taxation of coastal fishing of all kinds, including the collection of pearls, shells, &amp;c., as well as for boats and their crews. It contemplated, inter alia, a 4-mile limit for territorial waters, and elicited the usual reservation by His Majesty’s Government in November. (g) A regulation to facilitate official formalities and complaints concerning business transactions with Government departments, mentioned, but only partially published in the Umm-al-Qura of the 16th September. An additional article was published on the 9th December. (h) A long regulation on the Ministry of Finance, publication of which was completed on the 21st October. It laid down rules regarding the organisation of the Ministry and the control of public expenditure.37 (i) A decree on the departure of debtors, published on the 25th November, which provided legal means of preventing defendants from leaving the jurisdiction of courts in which they are sued for debt. O') A regulation on motor-car drivers, published on the 2nd December. 151. The above list does not include the constitutional enactments mentioned Section III (2). An omission in the Report for 1931 may be repaired by mentioning that a regulation of Waqfs, published on the 18th September, 1931. was of special interest to foreign Moslems. It provided means whereby, notwithstanding the general prohibition of the acquisition of real property by foreigners, they might acquire such property for the specific purpose of the immediate creation of a Waqf. VIII. —Press. 152. The weekly Umm-al-Qura continued to appear at Mecca during the year and to be the principal vehicle used by the Government for the publication both of official communiques, regulations, &amp;c., and inspired articles. It was especially remarkable for the profusion with which it published documents and inspired comments relative to the defeat of Ibn Rifada, the adoption of the name of Saudi Arabia and the revolt in Asir. The Umm-al-Qura, however, no longer stands alone. A new weekly called the Saut-al-Hijaz, or Voice of the Hejaz, began to appear in April 1932. The choice of this name might have been thought significant at a time when there was much discontent in the Hejaz with the Saudi regime. Some of the promoters were people who might have liked, if they dared, to voice that discontent. Indeed an ex-editor of this paper was among the townsmen arrested during the Ibn Rifada affair. The new organ has always, however, been carefully conducted, and has increasingly professed the best sentiments of loyalty. It had its reward in September when it was allowed to publish an interview with the King himself, in which he gave edifying though vague answers to three questions regarding the situation on the northern frontier since the annihilation of Ihn Rifada, His Majesty’s relations with neighbouring Governments, and the Arab Congress. 153. Nothing more need be said under this heading except that there was in 1932 even less machinery in Saudi Arabia for supplying the European press with news than there had been before. On one or two occasions the local manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. sent telegrams to Reuter at the request of the Government. Mr. Philby was little in the Hejaz, and while there observed the silence which he had imposed on himself as a press correspondent in 1931, when, as was said in the report for that year, he still desired to write nil nisi honum and therefore decided to write nil. IX. —Education. 154. It is again impossible to add anything material to what was said in Section IX of the report for 1930. There are no signs of any reorganisation on modern lines of the native Islamic system of education such as it is, and very little seems to be done in the way of sending young men to study abroad, although the information of the Legation on this subject is imperfect. A small number of doctors are sent to follow special courses, e.g., in X-ray work and bacteriology, but the number is almost negligible. The proposal to send a small party to Turkey for special training in military matters and aviation is mentioned in paragraph 83. X. —The Pilgrimage. 155. It was announced in 1931 (with doubtful propriety, according to some, from an Islamic point of view) that Pilgrimage Day would fall on a Friday in 1932, a coincidence which is believed to bring a much-multiplied blessing. In spite of this and other efforts to stimulate the flow of pilgrims, the numbers from overseas were very disappointing, chiefly owing to continued depression in the countries of origin, a little owing to the adverse attitude of certain Governments.■ MMP'' 38 156. The 1932 pilgrimage was the subject of a very full report sent home by the Legation on the 2nd September. Only the most important features of it can be dealt with here. 157. The following table gives the estimated number of overseas pilgrims of different origins for the last three years :— ^ Nationality. 1930. 1931. 1932. British and British administered— Indian ... 11.061 7,276 9,634 Malayan 2,590 506 80 West African 3,525 1,558 780 Sudanese 1,065 588 527 Palestinian 383 447 1,352 Dutch East Indian 32,000 16,803 4,375 Egyptian 17,127 4,967 2,312 Other, including minor British elements 17,070 7,201 10,005 Totals ... 84,821 39,346 29,065 158. It will be observed that, taking the two most important elements, the Dutch East Indies show an enormous falling off, while India actually sent more pilgrims in 1932 than in 1931. The increasing interest shown in the pilgrimage in India, both by the Moslem population generally, and more especially perhaps by persons of standing and education, has been a notable feature of recent years in spite of adverse economic conditions. Among the other countries which sent more pilgrims in 1932 than in 1931 were Afghanistan, Bokhara, French North Africa, Palestine, Syria and Iraq. 159. Pilgrimage Day duly fell on Friday, the 15th April. Climatic conditions were good. There had been some alarm early in the year owing to a reduction in strength of the Saudi medical service, but health conditions during the pilgrimage were excellent. The usual medical assistance was provided by the Indian, Netherlands and Egyptian Governments, and the Afghan Government installed for the first time a modest medical service at Mecca. After the pilgrimage no special quarantine restrictions were necessary, and the dispersal of the pilgrims was effected without difficulty. Security was once more well main tained in the area frequented by pilgrims. 160. A considerable controversy arose early in the year over the cost of the pilgrimage. The Legation had produced in the early autumn of 1931 a tentative estimate of the probable expenditure of an ordinary Indian pilgrim. This was drawn up before Great Britain went off the gold standard, and when it was discovered at the end of the year that all payments in the Hejaz must be made on the basis of gold, it was necessary to revise the estimate. Both the Saudi Govern ment and agitators in India took violent exception to the revised figures. There was more bad blood than good understanding over the business, which went on inconclusively until the pilgrimage was over. The controversy had, however, one good result. The Saudi Government produced in August a much more workman like and comprehensive tariff of charges for the next pilgrimage, including transport charges, the fixation of which had previously been deferred to the last possible moment. Lhis made it much easier for the Legation to draw up an estimate of expenditure in 1933 which could not be seriously criticised. 161. In other respects the 1932 pilgrimage presented few features of unusual interest and hardly any of a political nature. The King gave his usual banquet to notable pilgrims and made his usual speech, charged with religious emotion and appeals for unity in Islam. He gave offence in certain quarters by violent references to the evils of the Turkish and Shereefian regimes. “By God!” he cried, ‘ £ I fear the foreigner once, but I fear those who pretend to be Moslems three thousand times.” He complained of Moslem interference with Harameyn charities and Waqfs and with the performance of the pilgrimage. In this more practical vein, he referred also to financial problems in the manner described in paragraph 124.39 162. The King paid special attention in 1932 to influential foreign pilgrims. It looked after the pilgrimage as though he might seriously tackle various questions of pilgrimage reform, as regards the system of pilgrim guides, transport, &lt;fec., but there was little evidence of accomplishment up to the end of the year. 163. In the latter part of the year, the Saudi Government intensified their Propaganda in the most important centres from which pilgrims come in the hope of increasing the numbers in 1933. The outlook at the end of December was, how ever, very unpromising. XI. —Slavery and the Slave Trade. 164. An account is given in paragraph 59 ff. of the difficult question which arose in January over the case of a particular slave to whose manumission Ibn Saud objected on the ground that he was a Royal slave. Although the incident was liquidated satisfactorily from a political point of view, it left the situation in regard to Royal slaves even more nebulous than it had been. Trouble was feared in September in connexion with a slave belonging to one of the King’s brothers, who had taken refuge in the Legation, but the Saudi authorities, after a show of resistance, allowed him to be embarked without incident. 165. Possibly as a result of the Bakhit affair there was less obstruction in 1932 to the exercise of the right of manumission by the Legation in ordinary cases than there had been in 1931. Not including the two “Royal ” slaves, the number of those who took refuge in the Legation during the year was eighteen male and nine female, including one freed woman who feared re-enslavement. Their disposal was as follows :— Manumitted and repatriated : 14 males and 7 females. Locally manumitted : 1 male and 2 females. Left the Legation voluntarily before being dealt with : 1 male. On hand at the end of December : 2 males. 166. The problem of the disposal of manumitted slaves, in cases other than the very small number who can be manumitted locally with the consent of their ex-owners, still presents difficulty, but it was not acutely felt in 1932. The Sudan Government showed every readiness to receive Sudanese slaves, who were the majority. Although His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa has not thought it politic to attempt any general understanding with the Ethiopian Government, he has found it possible in practice, though usually with a good deal of delay, to induce them to receive ex-slaves believed by the Legation in Jedda to be Abyssinians. The Emperor imposes one restriction. He will not pay the cost of repatriating persons enslaved before the date of his decree abolishing slavery. It has been suggested that this is logical. To the Legation in Jedda it seems neither logical nor fair that the cost should fall on its charity fund. Had the slaves been in Abyssinia at the date of the decree they would have benefited by it. If they are in the Hejaz they must remain in slavery unless they are manumitted by the British Legation. Whatever may be thought on this subject, it is in practice most difficult to determine the date of enslavement of the persons concerned. 167. Attention was drawn in October to a case in which a Nigerian pilgrim was alleged to have sold into slavery at Medina his wife, a woman belonging by origin to French Equatorial Africa. According to a statement giving the result of enquiries by the Saudi Government, it appeared that the woman had been the slave of the Nigerian, and that he had sold her in Medina to a man who gave her an undertaking that she should be emancipated upon his death. The man had died in September 1932, and it was recognised that the woman had become free, though she preferred, it was said, to remain in Medina. The Nigerian having disappeared and the woman being inaccessible, the case was not pursued further. 168. There is little of more general interest to record under this heading except that slavery in Arabia was one of the subjects discussed by the League of Nations Committee of Experts on Slavery, whose report led to the decision of the Assembly on the 12th October to constitute a standing Advisory Committee of Experts. The experts’ report was tactfully tender regarding the States in Arabia in which slave traffic and slavery are still tolerated. It did more than40 justice to France, Italy and the Netherlands by stating inter alia that the warships of the two former, like the British, devote their efforts to preventing the importation of slaves into Arabia, and that any slave taking refuge in the British, French, Italian or Dutch Legations in Jedda is assured of his freedom. It still remains true that, apart from any action which other nations may take in their own territories, only the British navy and the British Legation in Jedd ^ attempt to combat slavery in Arabia. It will be seen elsewhere that the FrendF^ Government did not insist on the inclusion in their treaty with Ibn Sand of an article regarding the slave trade, and that the Italians had to content themselves with obtaining a statement of what the Saudi Government professed to be doing spontaneously. No further information came to light in 1932 regarding measures actually taken by the Saudi authorities to discourage the importation of slaves. One naval report reproduces a story dating from April that certain merchants had asked the Governor of Jizan whether he would encourage a revival of the traffic and that he had promised to do so, but there is no confirmation of this story. XII.— Naval Matters. 169. Visits were paid to Jedda by the Red Sea sloops as follows : Penzance, the 28th January to the 2nd February; Hastings, the 12th to 18th April the usual visit at pilgrimage time, during which the usual Hajj Regatta was held; Hastings, the 30th May to the 2nd June; Penzance, the 30th August to the 2nd September. H.M.S. Penzance, and for a time H.M.S. Hastings also, were employed in the Gulfs of Aqaba and Suez during the Ibn Rifada affair. 170. The only non-British naval visits during the year were those paid by the Italian Azio for the signature of the Saudi-Italian treaty in February; the French despatch vessel Dunkerque in March; and a Persian flotilla (see paragraph 85) in October. The proceedings of an Italian sloop on the Asir coast in December are mentioned in paragraph 75. 171. Reference is made in paragraph 138 to the purchase by the Saudi Government at Bahrein of a dhow to be used for naval purposes. 172. There is nothing else of general interest to record. The question of more frequent British naval visits to Jedda and of visits to other ports remained in abeyance during the year, so far as the Legation in Jedda is aware. Apologies are offered for a misuse of language in paragraph 200 (a) of the report for 1931. to which the Admiralty drew attention. It was incorrect to say that “His Majesty’s Government felt unable to endorse an Admiralty suggestion that the consent of the Hejazi Government should be sought,” &amp;c. The suggestion was discussed in the course of ordinary inter-departmental correspondence, and called for no decision by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom as such. XIII.— Miscellaneous Matters of British Interest. General Position of British Subjects. 173. There was no change in 1932 in the general situation described under this head in the annual reports for 1930 and 1931. The position in regard to the Capitulations remained as before, and no important lawsuits engaged the attention of the Legation, except the wholly abnormal A1 Fadhl case, which will be mentioned below. The Saudi authorities are inclined at times to introduce restrictive measures, as when early in the year they sought to limit access to ships in port. The passport regulations, too, are of a vexatious nature. On the whole, however, there is little interference with British subjects of European race in Jedda, the only place where there are any. British Moslems are far more at the mercy of the Saudi authorities, but no serious cases of maltreatment, as distinct from the usual grievances of pilgrims, came to the notice of the Legation during the year. 174. The practice of the Saudi Government in regard to deportation continued to be arbitrary, but few cases of special importance arose in 1932. It was suggested in the course of correspondence with the Foreign Office on the41 /&lt;5i general principles involved that an attempt might be made to arrive at some reciprocal arrangement with the Saudi Government for a more rigid application of the principles held by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. This was left to the discretion of the Legation, which up to the end of the year found no opportunity of pursuing the suggestion usefully. It continues to deal with individual cases as best it can. 175. One notable deportation was that of a Nigerian accused of illicit manufacture of alcohol, an offence which may expose the culprit to barbarous penalties. He was in some sense a servant of His Majesty’s Minister, but not exclusively employed by him. It was possible to exert some influence on his behalf, but not enough to save him from deportation. Nationality. 176. In June the Government decreed a census of the male inhabitants of towns in the Hejaz, and the project was carried through with some energy, though its results, considered simply as a census, are unknown. It was feared at the time that it would lead to measures being taken against persons declaring themselves to be foreigners. This apprehension seemed likely to be justified in October, when it was announced that an official committee at Mecca was calling upon all resident foreigners to produce documentary proof of their nationality, retaining the documents of those who could present'them and confronting those who could not do so within fifteen days with the alternatives of adopting Saudi nationality or leaving the country within three months. It might have been difficult to take exception to the principle of this, if adequate time had been allowed for foreigners without papers, who are very numerous, to regularise their position, but the drastic nature of the procedure enabled His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires to enquire regarding it and to make reservations, if it were being followed. It was probably as a result of this action that the Saudi Government suspended the activities of the committee. Nothing alarming happened during the remainder of the year, but it is probable that more will be heard of the matter. Claims against the Saudi Government. 177. The position regarding various claims, including those of the Egyptian Shell Company and the unfortunate chauffeurs in official and quasi-official employment, is briefly described in paragraphs 119 and 120. Al Fadhl (Alfazal) Case. 178. This case, a short account of which was given in paragraph 215 of the last report, was the subject of voluminous correspondence during the year. The special commission appointed by Ibn Saud to examine the affairs of the Fadhls with a view to their liquidation, made no headway owing to a difficulty in India, where the various parties interested have been engaged in most complicated litigation, over placing the books of the Fadhl firms in India at the disposal of the commission in Jedda. The difficulty was overcome at the end of the year, and there was a prospect of the commission being able to get on with its work in 1933, though very little of its achieving anything satisfactory to the creditors in India, the most important of whom is the Imperial Bank of Persia. European Cemetei'y at Jedda. 179. The vicissitudes of the early part of 1932 made it again impossible for the British Legation, which remains in charge of the cemetery, to do more than replenish the funds by taking a collect, effect urgent small repairs, and carry on as before. It is hoped to do better in 1933. Jedda Club. 180. This is quite dead, but has left children in the shape of annual golf and lawn tennis tournaments, not to mention that a handsome cup has been placed at the disposal of the organisers of the annual Hajj Regatta. Mr. Philby's Exploit. 181. Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby is still a minor factor in Arabian affairs. His political role in Saudi Arabia, never really great despite legends to the contrary, was smaller in 1932 than before. He has come to detest certain aspects r42 of the administration of his spiritual homeland, especially that part of it for which the Minister of Finance is responsible. He has become a little doubtful even of the King s ability to control the situation, though his doubts are those of a still fervent, if sorrowing, admirer. The chief reason, however, for the smallness of his political role in 1932 was physical remoteness. He started on his great journey across the Rub-al-Khali on the 6th January, got back to Mecca on the 5th April, and left very shortly after for England, where he spent the summed*** and autumn, not returning to the Hejaz until December. His journey was a very great exploit, valuable as scientific exploration, and most remarkable as a feat of endurance. It may be said of Mr. Philby that, after many wanderings in and on the fringes of civilisation, he found liimself in the “ Empty Quarter ” of Arabia. It is interesting to note that the permission given him to undertake the journey was conditional on certain undertakings. These secured to the Saudi Government exclusive rights in all information obtained by him, all maps and plans, and all finds, none of which were to be published or disposed of without their authority. It was also laid down that the British Government should have no right to claim anything in consequence of discoveries made by Mr. Philby, and that any territory discovered should belong to Ibn Saud. He and the King’s servants were to place His Majesty’s “flags of victory” in all the high places they passed. No international complications have ensued. APPENDIX.

Owing to the unexpected prolongation of my absence from Jedda since I left for Jerusalem on the 2nd February, I have had to write the bulk of this report in London.

The report owes much to the despatches, &amp;c., addressed to you and your predecessors by Mr. Hope Gill, while acting for me from the 15th August to the 15th December, and more particularly to the bi-monthly Jedda reports, which he wrote for the second half of the year. Mr. G. W. Furlonge has contributed the short but useful appendix on the import trade of the Hejaz.

IBN SAUD continued during 1931 to bestride like a Colossus the narrow world that separates the lied Sea from the Persian Gulf, a world of deserts and desert life for the most part. Although he remained the most considerable, as he is the most central, figure on the Arabian stage, he had, by the end of the year, lost something of his prestige and something of his effective power in the Hejaz. Always isolated, he found himself now in an isolation no longer splendid. In his religious policy he had made some show during the summer of swaying towards Wahhabi extremism, without any real abandonment of his modernising tendencies. These, however, are shown more in his readiness to utilise the material equipment of modern civilisation, motor cars, telephones, wireless, and the like, than in any wide religious toleration. He outrages many Moslems by the imposition of Wahhabi observances on pilgrims and by his disregard for shrines. He isolates himself in a more purely political sense by his dislike of any manifestation of Arab nationalism not based on the principle of his own domination. This dislike is intensified by his hatred of the Shereefian rulers of Iraq and Transjordan. It was plainly displayed in 1931, when the Prime Minister of Iraq brought the idea of the “ Arab Alliance ’ ’ into new prominence. It coloured, though it doubtless did not determine, Ibn Saud’s attitude towards the Moslem Congress at Jerusalem in December. The King isolates himself again in a world larger than either the Islamic or the Arabian, the family of civilised nations. He attaches vast importance to his membership of it as an equal of other States. But he is too jealous of his independence, and too suspicious, to commit himself to any serious participation in the life of the family as a whole; and his attitude on one question, that of slavery, sets him definitely apart He has, indeed, developed to some extent his relations with individual Powers, but, in 1931, the relations between him and Great Britain, the Power which still counts most in Arabia, underwent a deterioration, and he acquired no support of value to him in any other direction, despite a flirtation with Russia, in which he was much more wooed than wooing. Towards the end of the year he found it politic to admit the claim of the Imam of the Yemen to an important military position in the south of Asir, the Yemeni occupation of which he had hotly contested some months earlier. 2. Notwithstanding this decline, Ibn Sand weathered not unsuccessfully such political storms as gathered round him in 1931. His prospects at the end of it would have been none too bad but for growing penury; and penury, common in these days to so many greater States, would not have injured them so much, had not he and his Director-General of Finance between them destroyed such little credit as the country might possess internationally, or were the Hejaz, carrying not only its own burdens, but those of Nejd as well to a large extent, less completely dependent for prosperity on the pilgrimage. The outlook in this respect w as black at the end of 1930, black enough to produce the certainty of finoncial stress and to precipitate a monetary crisis in February. Pessimism was more than justified by the event, for, when the pilgrims were all gathered in April, there were only some 40,000 from overseas, half the number for the previous year. The Hejaz struggled on somehow, almost derelict from the time when about midsummer, the King went off to Riadh. Misery approaching to famine[7104] b 2 3 conditions prevailed among several of the tribes, and had its reflex in the towns, ihe Saudian regime became increasingly unpopular in places like Mecca and Jedda, where distaste for its religious principles was reinforced by economic depression. Attempts were, indeed, made to placate public opinion and to restore the situation by financial and other reforms, the future of which was uncertain at the end of the year. It seemed more than dbubtful, however, whether they could lead to much improvement, for, if the pilgrimage prospects in December 1930 were bad, they were very much worse in December 1931. It was evident that the Hejaz would be fortunate if anything approaching 30,000 pilgrims came from overseas; and the average of prosperity among individual pilgrims diminishes from year to year. 3. It used to be asked whether the Saudian system could survive its creator. It is now a question whether it can last during the life-time of Ibn Saud himself, a man little over 50 years of age, and, to all appearance, robust, in spite of the enormous number of his matrimonial adventures and the rumours sometimes circulated that his physical and mental powers are declining. His ability is great, but it is not too much to say that at the present time he holds his dominions together less by his own grip than because there are no potential rivals strong enough or free enough from other commitments Hike those that restrain, for instance, the rulers of Iraq and Transjordan) to challenge his position. There is, therefore, a possibility of disruption, not amounting to a definite probability, but sufficient to make it worth while to consider briefly the nature of the King’s tenure of the various parts of his dominions. 4. Ibn Saud is not in the strict sense a Bedouin, a fact which may explain to some extent the readiness he has shown on occasion to attempt to break up the traditional tribal system of Arabia. His homeland in Nejd consists of the group of more or less settled oases, of which Riadh, his first capital, is the centre of gravity. H aving recovered this ancestral domain in or about 1901, he extended his authority some years later, not very securely, to the adjoining territory of Qasim, a separate region of oases, with at least twx) important towns, which had hung doubtfully between Riadh and the waning power of the Beni Rashid of Hail. His final triumph over the latter and their extinction as a ruling house after the Great War consolidated his position in the whole central area and among the tribes which range over it. It may be regarded as fairly secure, subject to the possibility of a revival of the Rashidite power at Hail, or a revolt of the Shammar tribes on whom that power rested. The inhabitants of the area, both settled and nomad, have at least one thing in common with Ibn Saud in that they are all Wahhabis, though of variable fervour; in some cases indifferent, in some too ardent to tolerate easily the King’s innovations and compromises. The coastal region of Hasa, which Ibn Saud took from the Turks in 1913, is separated from the central area of oases by a desert belt. It resembles it in having a mixed population of settled and nomadic elements, and in consisting largely of steppe and desert; but it differs in climate, and in the fact that the settled ^population comprises an important Shia element. The King’s cousin, Abdullah Al-Jiluwi, is a strong Governor, and there is no evidence that Ibn Saud’s hold on Hasa has weakened. The area is too isolated to be naturally dependent on any other power in the peninsula, unless, indeed, the now insignificant Sheikhs of Koweit should regain their old influence in Eastern Arabia. 5. The territories mentioned in the preceding paragraph are the main constituents of “Nejd and its Dependencies.” Ibn Saud’s conquest of the Hejaz in 1924—25 added to them a kingdom of a very different character and brought him into much closer contact with other States than he had previously been. Unlike Nejd, the Hejaz had been more than a nominal part of the Ottoman Empire. A tradition of administration on some sort of European lines had been transmitted through the regime of King Hussein. It was the gathering place each year of pilgrims from all over the world, many of them the subjects of European Powers. It confronted Ibn Saud with problems which were largely new to him, although the tribal system was similar to that of other parts of Arabia. He approached the problems in a good spirit, considering himself a trustee, as it were, for the Holy Places of Islam. It is significant that his greatest success has been in coping with the tribes and establishing security; his greatest failure in dealing with other aspects of administration. This failure,4 due partly to the King’s lack of comprehension and the inadequacy o is advisers, became patent under the stress of financial pressure m • 18 serious because the Hejaz remains in so many ways a separate entity. It was described in the annual report for 1930 as being united to Me]d and its Dependencies as a separate kingdom in a personal union. This description is m accordance with the programme announced by the King himself eai *ly in when he expressed his intention of keeping the Hejaz distinct under its own Constitution and allowed a Hejazi National Assembly to vote him definite allowances in respect of the services which he was to render. It is not in accordance with Ibn Saud’s more recent tendency, which has been to emphasise the united character of his dominions without re-defining the nature of the union and without abandoning the principle of a separate Constitution for the Ilejaz. On a review of the available data in 1931, the Foreign Office inclined to the conclusion that the relations between the two kingdoms were more in the nature of a c ‘ real ” than a personal union. King and subjects alike would probably be baffled by these subtleties, but the people of the Hejaz, the townsmen at any rate, are conscious of their separate character and traditions. Disliking as they do the religious extremism of the Wahhabis, they are all the more discontented with a regime which brings Nejdi soldiers and officials into their country and drains off a large part of its diminished resources for the benefit of Nejd and an alien monarchy. In these circumstances the detachment of the Hejaz must be regarded as a possible event, which would become probable if anyone with a vested interest, e.g a member of the Shereefian family, were in a position to make a bid for the Hejazi Throne. One at least of the family, the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, would dearly love to get it by hook or by crook. His brothers, King Feisal and the ex-King Ali, are less probable aspirants. Little is known of the activities of the principal rival branch of the family, whose head, the Sherif Ali Haidar, lives in Beirut, but they should not be lost sight of. 6. There remains Ibn Saud’s latest acquisition, Asir, his tenure of which in practically complete sovereignty dates only from October 1930. His hold on it is probably precarious, but the situation there remained obscure throughout 1931. It is too soon to judge whether, if things go reasonably well elsewhere, he can consolidate his position so as to stand against local opposition and the ambitions of the Imam of the Yemen. If things should go really badly for Ibn Saud elsewhere, Asir would almost certainly drop away. He has insured his position to some extent, though at a sacrifice, by the treaty concluded with the Imam in December 1931, but little faith can be placed in the sincerity of either party. 7. The foregoing analysis discloses many weaknesses in Ibn Saud’s position. He has become a lonely and somewhat tragic figure holding his own with difficulty in a situation the worst immediate feature of which is an impoverishment due largely to world causes beyond his control and almost beyond his comprehension. He has been in tight places before and he may overcome his present difficulties, but he has never in the past been so hampered by lack of resources in proportion to the demands on his purse. II. —Foreign Relations. (a) With States in Arabia. (1) Iraq. 8. The relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq took a more favourable turn early in the year. On the 7th February King Feisal telegraphed to Ibn Saud proposing that his Prime Minister, Nuri Pasha, should take advantage of a recess of the Iraq Parliament to visit Jedda later in the month and sign the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Treaty, which had been agreed to in principle a year before and a text of which had been initialled at Bagdad on the 9th March, 1930; and to discuss all outstanding questions, including extradition, which had been so great a stumbling-block in the way of the establishment of treaty relations. Ibn Saud accepted this proposal with alacrity. All promised to go well, especially as, while the Iraq Government had asserted a rather extreme view about extradition as recently as the middle of December 1930, it was ascertained that they were in reality prepared to go some way to meet Ibn Saud on the question of excluding(5 raiding, whether by individuals or groups, and it was provided that attempts on the person of the respective Kings or members of their families should not be considered political offences. In the annexed letters Nuri Pasha gave an assurance, based partly on an Iraqi law of 1927, to the effect that all offences normally committed by Bedouin must necessarily fall outside the category of political offences, and the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs, taking note of this, promised reciprocity. 11. Nuri Pasha dealt with various matters not covered by the treaty. Some of these had been the subject of earlier correspondence, in which His Majesty’s Government were concerned. The following is a comprehensive list of the matters discussed or touched upon, with such information as is available as to how they were left:— iqqh^ ^ h a d been arranged at the Lupin ” Conference in February 19^0 that it should be left to King Feisal to adjudicate on all claims both ways etween Iiaq and Hejaz-INejd in respect of old raids, &amp;c. He had in due course assessed the amount payable to Iraq at £30,000, intending this to be a lump sum payable on balance, although he did not say so, with the result that Ibn Saud suggested a separate award regarding claims by his own subjects. This elicited an explanation from King Feisal in December 1930 of what his intention had een. n a note, dated the 29th January, 1931, the Hejazi Government rather surprisingly accepted it without demur, and stated that the money would be paid when a settlement of other outstanding questions had been reached. Meanwhile His Majesty s Government still held the sum of £10,000 paid by Ibn Saud under pressure m July 1930 in pursuance of a promise to the Political Resident to pay that amount as an act of grace in favour of Iraqi and Koweiti claimants, pending a general settlement. Its allocation had been delayed owing to a claim by the raqi Government that they were entitled to the whole of it.

In the course of the following days, Nuri Pasha placated Ibn Saud sufficiently, and the matter dropped, although ^ the King restated his views, mildly in a personal letter of the 11th April to Sir F. Humphrys, and more emphatically in a note addressed by his Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Legation on the 13th April. It was interesting to note how much less civil the Hejazi Government were to His Majesty’s Government than to the Iraqis over the whole affair. Anyhow, it died a happy death, although it is not clear what happened about the members of Ibn Mashhur’s following, whom King Feisal had undertaken to hand over to Ibn Saud together with his property. A list of persons and effects had been forwarded to the Hejazi Government through Sir F. Humphrys and the Legation at the end of January, and had suggested the comment that the property included no arms. This gave rise to some correspondence, but when it became certain that Nuri Pasha was coming to Jedda, the British authorities tacitly disinterested themselves in this aspect of the case also, and no more was heard of it. As for Ibn Mashhur himself, he remained in Syria throughout the year. It appears that he is not really on good terms with the once famous Nuri Shaalan, paramount chief of the Ruwalla tribes, owing to his having on some past occasion stolen one of the sheikh’s wives; but he has consorted with Nuri Shaalan’s grandson and possible heir, a young rip who seems to feel less strongly about the abdhetion of his step-grandinother. (d) Miscellaneous Matters .—The other subjects dealt with by Nuri Pasha included customs duties, passport arrangements, Haramein Wakfs, and co-operation in regard to scientific and technical matters. He gave Sir F. Humphrys to understand that he discussed the first two with satisfactory results, and he told Sir A. Ryan that he had made some last-minute concession to the Hejazis about Wakfs, without indicating its nature. As the Hejazi communique of the 10th April describes all four subjects as having been reserved for subsequent negotiation, it may be assumed that nothing very definite was settled. The Pasha explained to the Hejazi Government the agreement which he had just concluded on behalf of Iraq with the Transjordan Government. He informed them also of his jntention of sending two members of his delegation, Taha Pasha Al-Hashimi and another, on to the Yemen, a project which Ibn Baud welcomed, or at least did not object to. He claimed, perhaps optimistically, to have reconciled the King to the appointment as Iraqi Foreign Minister of Dr. Abdullah Damluji, who had formerly served Ibn Saud in a similar capacity, and he was given a friendly message to that gentleman. Finally, he broached two subjects, which fall to be dealt with elsewhere in this report, the proposed overland pilgrims’ route from Iraq to the Hejaz and the disposal of the Druze refugees under Sultan Al-Atrash (see paragraphs 154 and 33 (b)). He does not appear to have tackled the King on the delicate subject of the Arab Alliance. 12. Both parties designated in the summer the diplomatic representatives whom they had agreed to exchange. In each case the choice was peculiar. That of Iraq fell on Dr. Naji A1 Asil, who formerly served King Hussein as his representative in London, and who left there no very good reputation. Ibn Saud selected a certain Rushshaid Pasha, who formerly acted as Ibn Rashid’s representative in Constantinople, and who, having passed over to Ibn Saud with the other debris of the Rashidite regime, appears to have since lived obscurely in Mecca. These gentlemen, who were to be appointed to the position of Charge d’Affaires and consul-general, had not taken up their posts up to the end of the year, but were understood to be then about to do so. Some doubt remained as to whether Dr. Naji was to reside at Mecca in accordance with an arrangement which Nuri Pasha thought he had made, or at Jedda in accordance with the usual practice, to which, according to Fuad Bey Hamza, no exception could be made. 13. Little was heard of the relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq after the transactions related above. Calm reigned over their common frontier, although in mid-October King Feisal was perturbed by reports of a concentration of troops at Jauf, which was said to be directed against the pipe-line and railway surveys in Iraqi territory. On one or two occasions the Hejazi Government sought to interest His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in matters [7104] ' B 4between them and Iraq, notably that of the hospitality said to be shown to “remnant chiefs” of the Nejdi rebellion of 1929. His Majesty s Government made some enquiries in that connexion, but were in general very reluctant to be drawn into questions which should henceforward be the subject of direct negotiation between the two Governments concerned. (2) Transjordan. 14. It will be seen later that raiding on the frontier between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan was reduced during 1931 to quite small and manageable proportions. Not so the interminable controversies to which the situation gives rise between Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who have to bear the brunt of them in the continued absence of direct relations or even mutual recognition between the Governments of bransjordan and Hejaz-Nejd. Both sides were equally exasperated at the end of 1930. His Majesty’s Government had received no real reply to the British memorandum communicated on the 25th October of that year to the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs. The latter had raised certain points with which His Majesty’s Minister w r as instructed to deal orally on his return to Jedda in December. Fie found the Hejazi Department for Foreign Affairs in process of reorganisation, but any chance of this bearing fruit was destroyed by the illness of Fuad Bey Hamza, which culminated in his departure on leave on the 30th January. It was not until the 3rd February that Sir A. Ryan w T as able to discuss the question with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, who had been made Acting Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He then went over the whole of the recent ground. He reproached the Hejazi Government with their failure to reply seriously to the British memorandum of October; disposed of the petulant complaint in their interim reply that His Majesty’s Government placed more reliance on the reports of Transjordan and Iraqi officials than they did on information vouched for by the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs; and strongly deprecated the practical condonation of Nejdi raids in another note from Fuad Bey Hamza. Sheikh Yussuf’s reaction was unexpectedly favourable. He made play, indeed, with the argument that His Majesty’s Government were responsible for Transjordan, and that their interposition between the parties served as a protection to Transjordanian raiders, and he manifested openly the hostility of his Government towards Captain Glubb, the officer who had recently been placed in charge of the arrangements to cope with the situation on the Transjordan side. Nevertheless, he stated that the Hejazi Government were preparing a statement of the measures they were themselves taking; that the King w r as taking active steps to bring article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation; that Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Zeid, the former Hejazi agent at the MacDonnell investigation, had been appointed Inspector of Bedouin in the frontier area; and that the notorious Governor of Jauf, En-Neshmi, had been removed from his post. He asked for suggestions as to the best means of providing for the inter-communication contemplated in article 3 of the Hadda Agreement. 15. Before this fairly satisfactory communication was reported home, the indignation of His Majesty’s Government had been raised to boiling point by a report from Captain Glubb, which dealt mainly with the shamelessness and deplorable consequences of the raids of which the Transjordan Howeitat tribe had been the victims in the autumn of 1930. It was decided to make the strongest possible representations to Ibn Saud, and the decision was adhered to, notwith standing the more favourable turn which the negotiations in Jedda had taken. The upshot of an exchange of views between the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Minister was that a proposal to accuse Ibn Saud roundly of personal complicity in raiding was dropped, but every other point was developed with the utmost severity in a memorandum which Sir A. Ryan sent to the King on the 28th February, and in following up which he was to use all the force at his command in order to impress on His Majesty the gravity of the situation. The aspersions cast upon Captain Glubb were strongly repudiated in a separate note addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs earlier in the day, on the 28th February. The main memorandum was given something of the character of an ultimatum by a request for a reply as soon as possible, meaning, it was explained less officially, within four days at latest. His Majesty’s Government propounded9 the following points in the nature of suggestions or demands with the necessary explanatory comments :— (1) Noting Ibn Saud’s expressed readiness to bring article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation, and having in view the proved necessity for immediate co-operation between the authorities on both sides of the frontier, they proposed, in pursuance of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin’s request for suggestions as to the method of initiating such co-operation, that Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid should meet (a) to examine all representations and claims regarding raids since the 1st August, 1930; (b) to arrange for immediate restoration of loot on both sides; and (c) to arrange for the intercommunication of information and mutual restoration of loot in future. (2) They asked that Ibn Zeid should be invested with full executive powers, and that he and Captain Glubb should have power to call upon the representative sheikhs to out forward claims, &amp;c. (3) Having explained the inability of the Transjordan authorities to maintain the recent improvement of the situation unless immediate steps should be taken to return the loot captured from their tribes since the 1st August, His Majesty’s Government dwelt on various flagrant features of those raids, including the proved culpability of En Neshmi and his public statement that Ibn Sand permitted raiding into Transjordan, a statement widely believed and not effectively disproved. They said they “ must insist that, if this has not already been done, the strongest measures should be taken to counteract the effect of En-Neshmi’s action in giving countenance to raiding, and to make it publicly known that His Majesty King Abdul Aziz expressly disavows and condemns it.” They expressed the hope that a recent report of En-Neshmi’s appointment to the command of tribal forces would prove to be unfounded. (4) They asked the Hejazi Government to inform them as soon as possible that they agreed to the proposed meeting, and that Ibn Zeid would receive full powers to deal with the matters proposed, including the immediate restitution of camels and other loot captured from Transjordan tribes since the 1st August. They added that Captain Glubb would be authorised to arrange for the restitution of any loot identified as having been taken from Hejazi or Nejdi tribes. (5) Finally, His Majesty’s Government, having regard to the urgent necessity for restoring the camels looted from Transjordan, offered British co-operation in the Wadi Sirhan, if the Hejazi Government should find themselves confronted with any practical difficulty in returning them immediately. 16. So the stage was set for a battle royal, the first engagement in which took place when Ibn Saud gave audience to Sir A. Ryan on the 2nd March. The language used by the Minister to impress His Majesty with the gravity of the situation was energetic; he referred inter alia to the belief current on the frontier that Ibn Saud himself was at the back of the raiders, though without endorsing it. The King was both frightened and hurt, but he presented a bold front. Having parried Sir A. Ryan’s personal onslaught, with only one open display of indignation, i.e., over the suggestion of personal complicity, he caused replies to be sent to the British communications on the following day. The Hejazi note about Captain Glubb was reasonably satisfactory in form. The reply to the main memorandum combined a minimum of concession with a maximum of evasion. The King reaffirmed his intention of bringing article 3 of the Hadda Agreement into operation, but maintained that the proposed meeting between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid would serve no useful purpose until agreement had been reached as to the method of dealing with raids subsequent to the beginning of the MacDonnell investigation, in connexion with which he made a claim against Transjordan for stated quantities of loot; and as to the principles to be observed by the two representatives. His most important suggestion under the latter head was that, in the case of large-scale raids, they should exchange information and, if necessary, meet, but that any decisions they might take should be ad referendum. He recognised that raids during a meeting like the MacDonnell investigation were scandalously un-Bedouin, but accused Trans-jordan of having been the first to ofiend in this respect. He refused to condemn En-Neshmi, whom he had dismissed only to avoid controversy He undertook to instruct Ibn Zeid to meet Captain Glubb on receipt of a reply from His Majesty s Government, but refused any restitution of loot to Transjordan until a start snou d have been made on the other side. In his answer under the filth heading m paragraph 15 above he raised a new point of his own, which was destined o g lv G 9 trouble. He declined the offer of assistance in the Wadi Sirhan, thanking Go that he had power over all his subjects. The only help he sought, he added, was that criminals fleeing into Transjordan should be handed back. 17. This reply placed His Majesty’s Government on the horns of a dilemma. While they considered it in many ways unsatisfactory, they were a\erse from drastic action such as the occupation of the W adi Sirhan or the temporary re( ^ull of their Minister. They considered that the reply, evasive though it was, did not exclude the achievement of their essential purpose, that of bringing about a meeting of the frontier authorities and the settlement of the questions at u^ue on a local and tribal basis. They were able to accept the principles by wmch Ibn Saud wished the two representatives to be governed, although they did so reluctantly as regards his proposal that decisions relative to important raids should be taken ad referendum only. There ensued a protracted correspondence, the details of which need not be reproduced Its upshot may be summed up as follows :— (a) It was agreed about mid-April that, in view of the delay in establishing a complete basis for the examination of raids subsequent to those investigated by Mr. MacDonnell, Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid should hold a preliminary meeting limited to more general purposes. His Majesty’s Government wished that at this meeting the representatives should exchange information and views as to the best means of policing the frontier. Ibn Sand scouted the idea that there need be any discussion of measures of police, but His Majesty's Government did not allow this caveat to stand in the way of the agreement. It was further agreed, without prejudice to the holding of the preliminary meeting, that Captain Glubb and ibn Zeid should at once begin to communicate with each other by wireless. (b) It remained to settle various points connected with the main meeting to deal with raids. It was agreed that both Governments should publicly disavow and condemn all future raiding and that the representatives should be empowered to supervise the immediate restitution of loot on both sides, as soon as their decision had been sanctioned by the Government in accordance with the ad referendum principle reluctantly accepted by His Majesty s Government. Ibn Saud was most unwilling that the meeting should take the shape of a formal enquiry involving the examination of witnesses. Eventually, however, he agreed to a formula permitting the evidence of sheikhs to be taken, when considered necessary by the representatives, subject to a condition whereby the nationals of either Power seeking to evade compliance with orders to attend by fleeing into the territory of the other should be apprehended and handed over to their own authorities. The correspondence on these various points was completed on the 18th June. {c) The point raised by Ibn Saud in his original reply of the 3rd March relative to what came to be known as “the surrender of raiding criminals” was successfully floated off into a separate channel, so that it should not impede the arrangements for the meetings between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid. 18. There had been much cry, but there was little wool. The outcome of all that had passed may conveniently be stated under the same three heads, as follows :— (a) After various delays the preliminary meeting took place on the 3rd June at Hazim Wells in Transjordan close to the frontier. It was friendly and Ibn Zeid was quite ready to discuss a much wider range of subjects than might have been expected from the diplomatic correspondence. He showed himself very amenable to Captain Glubb’s suggestions until in the end he torpedoed all of them by explaining that he was not empowered to come to any agreement without reference to his master. The most that was achieved (and this did not emerge till long after Captain Glubb had reported that the discussion was generally inconclusive) was a gentleman’s understanding that neither Government wouldseize loot from tribesmen found with it in their territories pending a liquidation of claims. (b) The main meeting to deal with raids subsequent to the 1st August, 1930, began on the 15th August. The two representatives again discussed rather a wider range of subjects than had been defined in the diplomatic correspondence; but they again achieved little except that they broke the period under review into two parts, viz., the 1st August, 1930, to the 18th January, 1931, and the 19th January, 1931, onwards. Arrangements were apparently made for the restitution of such little loot as had been taken since the latter date, but Ibn Zeid professed to be without adequate material to discuss the much more important raids that had taken place in the earlier period, although he was understood to have had full instructions and Fuad Bey subsequently assured His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Jedda that Ibn Zeid had in fact been supplied in good time with a complete list of claims. In reporting on the proceedings of the 15th August, Captain Glubb expressed pessimistic views as to the possibility of arriving at a settlement of the outstanding claims by means of further meetings on the frontier. He went on leave shortly after and for one reason or another there was no resumption of the “ main meeting ” up to the end of the year. (c) Meanwhile, an attempt had been made to meet Ibn Saud on the question of raiding criminals” by means of a carefully devised formula, which in the final form proposed by His Majesty’s Government in May took the following shape:— “Hejazi or Nejdi nationals, who have taken part in raids in Trans jordan territory and have returned to Hejaz-Nejd, and who attempt to escape from penalties imposed on them for raiding by fleeing into Transjordan, will, if possible, be prevented, upon direct notification of their names and other available particulars by the Hejaz-Nejd frontier authorities to the corresponding Transjordan authorities, from crossing the frontier into Transjordan. If they enter Transjordan, the Transjordan authorities will, on receiving the necessary information from the Hejaz-Nejd authorities, use their best endeavours to prevent them from remaining in Transjordan and, if possible, to expel them into Hejaz-Nejd. “This undertaking is given on the understanding that the authorities in Hejaz-Nejd will deal in the same manner with Transjordan raiding criminals in similar circumstances. This undertaking may be terminated either by the Hejaz-Nejd Government or by the Transjordan Government on two months’ notice, and shall thereafter apply only to those raiding criminals who have crossed the frontier before its termination.” 19. The negotiations on this formula, at first promising, broke down completely; and more than anything else on the words “if possible,” to which Ibn Saud demurred and which His Majesty’s Government were unwilling to define. The difficulty was only aggravated by a well-meant attempt on the part of His Majesty’s Minister to explain them in language which would satisfy the Hejazi Government, but which was afterwards found to fall far short of the liberality with which the Transjordan authorities wished to be able to construe the innocent-looking phrase. His Majesty’s Government then despaired of the formula, and took advantage of the fact that the Hejazi Government were not pressing the matter to explore the alternative possibility of some kind of formal instrument to be concluded between Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd. This idea had to be discarded because neither His Majesty’s Government nor the Amir Abdullah were prepared to be formally the ‘ ‘ party of the other part ’ to an agreement with Ibn Saud. No solution could he found for this legal difficulty, and, as the Hejazis still refrained from pressing it, the question of raiding criminals remained in abeyance till the end of the year. 20. It may be deduced from the foregoing account that, while Ibn Saud had been driven by the British quasi-ultimatum of the 28th February to make some show of giving effect to article 3 of the Hadda Agreement, he had no intention of going further than might be necessary to turn the wrath of His Majesty s Govern ment into weary toleration of a nuisance. It would, indeed, be impossible foi him, without abandoning the personal control which is a fundamental condition of his supremacy, to give full powers to any subordinate like Ibn Zeid. Anyhow, his Ministry for Foreign Affairs missed no opportunity of trying to get the12 question back on to diplomatic ground. In conversations at the beginning o September Fuad Bey sought to engage Mr. Hope Gill in a discussion of “ additional principles” to be laid down for the future guidance of representa- tives on the frontier. In a note of the 10th September, conveying a gmc g m g assent to the finding of His Majesty’s Government based on Mr MacDonne 1 s investigation (see paragraph 26), the Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated officially questions which Fuad Bey had already put in a personal letter to Sir A. Ryan as to the procedure to be followed in regard to raids subsequent to the 1st August, 1930, and the measures to be taken to prevent future raiding. The note suggested that the deplorable situation created by the finding ot 1 Lis Majesty’s Government could only be remedied by compensation for past violations; the conclusion of agreements between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan, similar to those between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq; and “ the removal of those causes of friction on the Transjordan frontier which were causes of friction on tne Iraq frontier ”—a hit apparently at Captain Glubb. 21. The situation as a whole was reviewed, with special reference to the Hejazi note just cited, at an inter-departmental meeting at the Foreign Office on the 23rd September, at which Sir A. Ryan, Colonel Cox and Captain Hlubb weie present. As a result of this, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires m Jedda was furnished with the material for a reply to the Hejazi Government, which he sent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 7th November. His Majesty s Govern ment pointed out that the procedure for dealing with raids subsequent to the 1st August, 1930, had already been threshed out, and made it plain that they contemplated a resumption of the meetings between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid. In replying to the enquiry of the Hejazi Government regarding measures to prevent'further raids, they restated their frequently expressed opinion that the object in view could only be achieved by the whole-hearted co-opeiation of the local authorities on the frontier, a view confirmed by the diminution in i aiding since such co-operation had been instituted. They urged the importance of seeking by every means to extend its scope and usefulness, and asked that instructions should be given to Ibn Zeid similar to those which were being given in this sense to Captain Glubb. They preferred, in view of the Amir Abdullah s reluctance to enter into any sort of direct relations with Ibn Saud, to make no reference to the suggestion'that agreements similar to those with Iraq should be concluded between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan. They ignored also the covert request in the Hejazi note for Captain Glubb s removal. 22. The instructions on which Mr. Hope Gill based his note of the 7th November to the Hejazi Government crossed a despatch from him seeking guidance as to his future attitude, having regard to his conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza and the pessimistic conclusion of Captain Glubb s report on his meeting with Ibn Zeid in August. This gave His Majesty’s Government an opportunity of reaffirming, in a despatch of the 27th November, their view that all the questions at issue should be left, as far as possible, at any rate in the first instance, for local discussion between the representatives on the frontier. I hey were reluctant to be drawn into further diplomatic negotiations legardmg the details of future frontier procedure and co-operation. The Legation was informed that, if the Hejazi Government insisted on pursuing such questions at Jedda, they should be treated, as far as possible, as minor matters concerning the Transjordan authorities; that they, the Hejazi Government, should be requested to state their case in writing; that any written statement obtained should be referred to the High Commissioner for his observations, and that his views should form the basis of a reply to the Hejazi Government, subject to the normal discretionary right of His Majesty’s representative in Jedda to seek instructions from home on any point which he might think it necessary to submit for consideration by His Majesty's Government. These instructions reached the Legation about the time of Sir A. Ryan’s return from leave, in December. At the 5 end of the year he was awaiting an opportunity of acting on them in the course of further conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza. r 23. It would overload this already lengthy section to describe in detail the various side issues raised in the correspondence waged during the year. A question arose regarding the Hejazi practice of retaining, as a sort of commis sion or charge for services rendered, a portion of any loot recovered from raiders13 before returning it to the original owners. There were allegations of asylum being given to criminals in Transjordan and of tribesmen being enticed across the frontier. At one moment the Mecca newspaper “ Umm-al-Qura ” took to publishing attacks on the Amir Abdullah, which were known to have been written by Ibn Baud’s factotum, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin. The authorities in Transjordan took exception to the taxation of their tribesmen sojourning in the Wadi Sirhan for grazing. They were not supported by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the view that the principle of such taxation was barred by articles 4 and 7 of the Hadda Agreement, but the arbitrary manner in which it was levied continued to give rise to complaint. The Hejazis, on their side, adduced one instance of Nejdi tribesmen having been taxed on visiting a Transjordan well for watering only, a grievance which still awaited investigation at the end of the year. Captain Glubb drew attention more than once to the tendency of the Hejazi Government to multiply posts in a spirit of competition and to equip them more elaborately than the corresponding Transjordanian posts, although the value of the equipment was happily diminished by shortage of benzine to move the motor transport. There were frequent rumours of concentrations in the interior of Hejaz-Nejd, not 'far from the frontier, whether to menace Transjordan or to overawe Ibn Baud’s own tribesmen. Complaints by the Hejazi Government regarding the action of Captain Glubb in specific cases led, inter alia, to the consideration of a procedure which came to be known as “retaliatory confiscation,” i.e., the retention of looted camels due for return to the original owners, as a means of pressure to obtain the settlement of other cases. In this connexion one particular camel belonging to the Howeitat chieftain Ibn Jazi, already famous in the desert for its swiftness, secured a permanent niche in history; but His Majesty’s Government disallowed “ retaliatory confiscation,” even with the object of obtaining the return to its robbed owner of so notable an animal. The raid of the 28th September on the Atun (see paragraph 32) gave rise to a crop of questions as to the nationality of that section of the Howeitat, the position in regard to Araif, i.e., camels held by one tribe and claimed by another as being returnable loot captured in past raids. Finally, there was in the latter part of the year a very important and complicated question, ventilated in British circles only, and not by the Hejazi Government, as to the lie of the frontier, more especially that between Transjordan and the Hejaz, where it was thought that, owing to an error in the maps used, an area in which the Royal Air Force are established might be south of the de facto boundary resulting from the agreements made by Sir G. Clayton in 1927. It is the less necessary to do more than enumerate these matters as most of them were outstanding at the end of the year. 24. An attempt has been made in the foregoing paragraphs to digest in an intelligible form the voluminous correspondence which passed in 1931. It may be added by way of general comment that, while raiding has been reduced for the time being to almost negligible proportions, the political problem of the Transjordan frontier is almost impossible of solution on any present basis. If Ibn Baud were in a position to delegate authority to his local representatives and were willing to treat the matter as one of frontier police, it would be compara tively easy to control the situation. As it is, every local incident provides the material for diplomatic wrangling. The frontier is purely artificial, one of the worst in the world for practical purposes. Nomad tribes, even if normally located on one side or the other, constantly cross it for purposes of grazing. Any attempt to apply to them ordinary European criteria of nationality or jurisdic tion is futile, the British authorities in Transjordan do their best to maintain order, but nothing short of a redefinition of the frontier, preferably so as to give the Wadi Sirhan to Transjordan, would produce the necessary conditions for its establishment on a stable basis. Worst of all, both Ibn Baud and the Amir Abdullah are more concerned with future contingencies than with present peace. The Amir would like to rule not merely the Wadi Sirhan, but the whole of the Hejaz. Ibn Baud would probably like to include Transjordan in his dominions, even though in his present state of weakness he may play with the idea of placing his relations with the Amir on a treaty basis. For each of them the principal tribes on the frontier, like the Howeitat and the Beni Atiya, are pawns in a high political game. The Howeitat are in the main Transjordanian; Ibn Baud would like to seduce or compel them to his own allegiance. The Beni Atiya, troublemakers wherever they are, are in the main identified with Hejaz-Nejd; the Amir would like to make them the spear-point of his dreamed-of recovery of the Hejaz for a Hashimite ruler. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, unable for reasons connected with Palestine to press the Amir to accept the present situation by recognising Ibn Saud, are bored to tears at having to concern themselves with every detail of tribal squabbling; they would like subordinate authorities to relieve Downing Street of so tiresome a burden. Everyone who has anything to do with the matter is profoundly dissatisfied. It was in con templation at the end of the year that His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda should visit Jerusalem early in 1932 and confer with the High Commissioner with a view to effecting at least such improvement as might result from a closer liaison between the two posts. 25. It is an unfortunate element in the general situation that nothing abates Ibn Baud’s hostility to Captain Glubb, and that his own representative, Ibn Zeid, is in a weak position not only vis-a-vis of his master, but of the Governors on the Hejaz-Nejd side of the frontier. The Hejazi Government, notwithstanding the strong defence of Captain Glubb by His Majesty’s Govern ment in the separate note of the 28th February, miss no opportunity of criticising his proceedings. Various administrative charges made on the Hejaz- Nejd side during 1931 had the general effect of filling the more important Governorates with men more considerable and less conciliatory than Ibn Zeid, and forces of some importance were placed at their disposal. It must be admitted that those steps were probably taken at least as much with the object of asserting control over Ibn Baud’s own tribes as with reference to the frontier. To that extent they are not all to the bad, but there has been reason to complain, none the less, of arbitrary action by the Governors in matters concerning Transjordan. It must further be admitted that, although the police work on the Transjordan side is now admirably done, there is a certain lack of cohesion among the various British authorities ultimately concerned. A singular illustration of this was afforded when the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs stated in a note of the 22nd June that, pending the general settlement between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid, his Government were refraining from recovering from tribes in Hejaz- Nejd territory camels known to have been looted in the course of raids into that territory, and asked that Transjordan should observe similar restraint. The British authorities received this suggestion so coldly that no answer was returned to the Hejazi note; yet it was afterwards discovered that a “gentleman’s agreement” on exactly the lines proposed had been arrived at between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid on the 3rd June (see paragraph 18 (a) above). 26. Incidental reference has been made above to the results of the investigation conducted by Mr. M. S. MacDonnell in 1930 in connexion with raids prior to the 1st August of that year. The limitations imposed on his enquiry by the nature of the subject matter, and still more by the obstructive tactics of the Hejazi authorities, made it impossible for him to provide His Majesty’s Government with the material for an arbitral award on each case submitted to him, and he could do no more than recommend a rough and ready solution on a fifty-fifty basis. After prolonged consideration, His Majesty’s Government decided to adopt this recommendation. In August 1931 they notified the Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan Governments of their conclusion. The note conveying it to the Hejazi Government on the 12th August recited the reasons which had made it impossible to arrive at detailed estimates of loot taken from the nationals of either Government by nationals of the other. The note went on as follows :— I he information furnished to His Majesty’s Government is, however, sufficient to enable them to judge that it would be fair and reasonable that all claims referred to them by both Governments should be held to cancel each other out. His Majesty’s Government conclude, therefore, that all claims arising from raids between the two countries which took place before the 1st August, 1930, should, on the basis of such cancellation, be held to be settled and conclusively disposed of. ‘This is His Majesty’s Government’s final finding.” ihis decision, which was, for legal reasons, expressly described as a finding and not as an award, caused great dissatisfaction on both sidles. The Transjordan15 authorities felt that they had been very hardly used. As for Ibn Saud, he criticised in a note of the 10th September both Mr. MacDonnell and the reasons given by His Majesty’s Government for their inability to arrive at exact estimates. He spoke of the bad effects which the finding would produce and the difficulty which he would have in pacifying his outraged subjects, but declared that he would stand by his undertaking to accept any decision given by His Majesty’s Government. He went on to deal with the actual and future situation in the manner described in paragraph 20 above. The half-heartedness of his acceptance of the finding was emphasised by his reference to “ compensation for past violations ’ ’ in his summary of the measures necessary in his view to remedy a deplorable situation; by his subsequent refusal to hear his half share in the costs of the MacDonnell investigation, a refusal so worded as to suggest that he contemplated the possibility of some further adjustment of the claims covered by it; and perhaps by his willingness to allow Sherarat raiders to retain certain of the camels looted from the Atun on the 28th September, 1931, on the ground that the Atun had previously stolen them from the Sherarat. The “perhaps” in this last sentence is necessitated by the fact that it was disputed whether the camels in question had been raided by the Atun before the 1st August, 1930, in which case they would have become the property of the holders as a result of the MacDonnell finding, or whether the Atun had captured them in subsequent raids, in which case, subject to a doubt cast by the Hejazi Government on the Transjordanian nationality of the Atun, the matter would fall to be decided by Ibn Zeid and Captain Glubb. 27. The MacDonnell finding, even if unlikely to be observed scrupulously, has the one merit of having set up a definite legal position, which can be relied on for diplomatic purposes in case of future need, in regard to all raids prior to the 1st August, 1930. The position as regards raids from the 1st August, 1930, . to the end of the year (more exactly, up to the 18th January, 1931), remains indeterminate. It seems probable that in this case, also, the eventual solution will be a reciprocal cancellation of claims. Strongly as the Transjordan authorities felt about the Nejdi raids of the autumn of 1930, which deprived the Howeitat of several hundred camels and reduced them to the verge of starvation, they would be prepared for such cancellation, if assured of genuine collaboration on Ibn Sand’s side in the future. It has not, however, been thought advisable on the British side to rush into any proposal for a “fifty-fifty” settlement in respect of the period under consideration; partly because there may still be hope of redress for the Howeitat; partly because a settlement regarding the raids in question is the theoretical raison d'etre of continued meetings between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid, which, in spite of all limitations, serve a useful purpose from a more general point of view, and may pave the way for the continuous co-operation which His Majesty’s Government have at heart. 28. It remains to deal with the situation as regards actual raiding on the frontier. From the records in His Majesty’s Legation, it appears that twenty-two raids w T ere alleged to have taken place between the 1st August, 1930 (the end of the period covered by the MacDonnell finding), and the end of that year. Sixteen of these were attributed to Transjordan tribesmen, including two reported by the Transjordan authorities themselves, but not protested against by the Hejazi Government. Six were raids from Hejaz-Nejd. The figure, though small, includes the important raids in September and October, which had the retarded effect of precipitating the controversy described earlier in this section; and one raid through Transjordan into Syria, for which the Syrian authorities sought to hold the Transjordan Government responsible. 29. The raiding situation in the autumn of 1930 was thus one of some anxiety, although even then it was not as grave as might be inferred from the crisis in the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Ibn Saud, to which it subsequently gave rise. It underwent a marked improvement towards the end of the year, after Captain Glubb had taken charge on the Transjordan side. The improvement was maintained throughout the whole of 1931. Leaving out of account an unsubstantiated complaint by the Hejazi Government early in 1932 regarding certain alleged incursions from Transjordan in the previous December, the total number of raids or alleged raids recorded in the Legation files for the year did not exceed twelve, exclusive of some abortive16 W expeditions from Hejaz-Nejd, which were headed off by the Transjordan authorities before any raiding had occurred, and one affair which had formed the subject of an obscure Hejazi note, but which proved to have been an internal raid m the Hejaz anterior to and separate from a raid into Transjordan by the well-known brigand, Nawwaj-al-Awaji. 30. Seven of the twelve raids just mentioned were laid to the charge of Transjordan tribesmen. All but one occurred between the 3rd February and the 3rd April. All were of little intrinsic importance. In five cases in which specific damage was alleged by the Hejazi Government the total of loot and casualties shown in their protests was 183 camels, 620 riyals, one rifle and some clothing, one man killed and four wounded. An element of political importance was introduced into another case in which the Hejazi Government, without stating the amount of loot taken, accused Beni Sakhr tribesmen of a raid against the Al-Fitna section of the Howeitat and a certain Khitam Ibn Jandal. The matter was eventually left for discussion between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid, but in the intervening correspondence both sides raised controversial issues of a troublesome kind. The Transjordan authorities held that both parties were Transjordan subjects, and that the raid was no concern of Ibn Baud’s, although it had admittedly taken place in his territory. The Hejazi Government countered by contesting the nationality of Al-Fitna. They also made explicit accusations, which had to be rebutted, regarding Captain Glubb’s handling of the matter. The seventh and only remaining case was one of rather later date, which only came to the notice of the Legation in August, when the Transjordan authorities spontaneously asked the Hejazi Government to produce the owners of two camels and two rifles which had been recovered from a party of thieves. 31. It may be noted in passing that in several of the cases summarised in the preceding paragraph the Transjordan authorities made a practice of asking that Hejaz-Nejd complainants should be told to report to Captain Glubb. This suggestion was obviously unwelcome to the Hejazi Government, who evaded it by leaving the cases outstanding pending their discussion between Captain Glubb and Ibn Zeid, except in one instance, in which they acquiesced to the extent of undertaking to send a representative of the Governor of A1 Ula to take delivery of loot awaiting restitution. 32. Five of the twelve raids recorded during the year were alleged to have been committed by Hejaz-Nejd subjects. Two of these were insignificant. Three others were more important, namely, an attack on a patrol of the Arab Legion on the 30th March, in which three men of the legion were killed, one wounded and the effects of all stolen; a raid on the 5th May, in which sixty camels were taken and one man killed; and a raid on the 28th September, in which a party of Transjordan tribesmen camping in Hejazi territory were robbed of nearly 200 camels. In the first case the Hejaz-Nejd Government showed some signs of being impressed by the strong representations of the Legation, and eventually returned three camels and three rifles. The second case was chiefly important because the Hejazi Government denied the Transjordan nationality of the victims, members of the Atun section of the Howeitat. The same question arose in the third case. The Hejazi authorities returned thirty-five of the camels direct to the Atun, but they claimed them as Hejazi subjects, and held, moreover, that some of the camels were non-returnable as they were the proceeds of earlier raids by the Atun themselves. The matter created a storm of indignation on the part of the authorities in Transjordan, who saw in it not only a serious aggression against tribes whom they were trying to restrain, but an attempt on the part of Ibn Baud to capture the allegiance of the Atun, as well as to ignore the MacDonnell finding, under which any loot taken before the 1st August, 1930, fell to be regarded as having passed into the ownership of the actual holders at the time of the investigation The affair, thus complicated, gave rise to an active correspondence among the British authorities concerned. On the 25th December His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan forwarded to the Legation, and presumably to the Colonial Office, three reports from the British officers responsible for the maintenance of order in Transjordan, in which they attacked the conciliatory policy of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with hardly less vigour than they upbraided Ibn Baud. Up to the end of the year His Majesty’s Government had taken no decision on the issues raised. * V[7104] c 17 33. A few other matters concerning the position between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan may be dismissed more briefly as follows :— (a) StatuS' of Aqaba-Maan. —This was dealt with as a major political question afiecting the relations between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Ibn Sand in paragraphs 67-68 of the annual report for 1930. It remained in abeyance throughout 1931, but retains some importance from a local point of view, inasmuch as the reluctance of His Majesty’s Government to see it reopened imposes a certain restraint on the British authorities in Transjordan. Ibn Baud, though acquiescent, maintains the view, as Fuad Bey reminded Sir A. Ryan in the summer, that his alleged juridical rights over the area remain intact, a theory which may be at the back of his attitude, e.g., in claiming the Atun section of the Howeitat as his subjects. The purely de facto character of the frontier also increases the difficulty of dealing with the question of the true lie of the boundary between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan, a matter which has been briefly referred to already in paragraph 23. (b) Druse Refugees.- —The disposal of the Druse refugees sojourning in Nejd close to the frontier continued to engage attention throughout the year. During the earlier portion of it the most promising proposal appeared to be that they should be given hospitality in Iraq. Nuri Pasha was anxious to promote this, and during his visit to Jedda in April sought to enlist the assistance of Sir A. Ryan in getting Ibn Saud to put the matter to the Druse leader, Sultan A1 Atrash, in such a way as would ensure his acceptance of King FeisaTs invitation. His Majesty’s Government shared the view of Sir F. Humphrys that it would be premature to move on those lines, pending the assent of the French authorities in Syria, who had expressed in principle their readiness to concur, but wished for further information as to the locality in which it was proposed to settle the Druses and the conditions to which they would be subjected. Eventually the proposal fizzled out, and the Druses remained in two parties at Nebk and a place called Haditha, which appears to be actually in Transjordan, but so marginally placed that all the refugees have been regarded as enjoying Ibn Saud’s hospitality. In the latter part of the year Sultan A1 Atrash sought permission to settle in Transjordan. The Resident at Amman favoured this, subject to the choice of a locality sufficiently remote from Syria, and took action with a view to the consent of the French authorities being obtained. Colonel Cox considered that, if Sultan A1 Atrash and his personal party were thus provided for, the remainder of the refugees would evaporate, as they had already shown a tendency to do. In the circumstances described, the question did not arise in 1931 in any form requiring representations by the Legation in Jedda to the Hejazi authorities. (c) Customs Relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan. —The question of the reply to be returned to the Hejazi Government’s request for an explanation of the note addressed to them by the Legation on the 20th April, 1930, continued to engage the attention of His Majesty’s Government throughout 1931. As the Hejazi Government did not revert to the main subject of the correspondence, the Legation was not called on to take any action beyond reminding the Foreign Office that the matter was growing rather stale. The Hejazi Government did, however, make one move by complaining on the 4th April that Palestinian and Trans jordanian merchants were still introducing goods into Nejd by routes other than those prescribed in 1928. The Minister for Foreign Affairs requested that the merchants should be warned that goods so introduced were liable to confiscation and they themselves to punishment. On the attention of the Transjordan authorities being drawn to the matter, they undertook in June to publish a suitable warning and to forward the text of it to Jedda. This had not been received up to the end of the year. (3) Yemen and A sir. 34. The completion late in 1930 of the practical annexation of Asir by Ibn Saud increased the latent tension between the latter and the Imam Yahya. In January 1931 the Italian Government expressed, through their Embassy in London, anxiety lest the two Sovereigns should come to blows, and suggested that Great Britain and Italy should exercise a moderating influence on the King and the Imam respectively. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were prepared to act on this suggestion if His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda had18 categorical information pointing to a danger of conflict, but no such information was available at the time, and on the 28th February the Foreign Office endorsed Sir A. Ryan’s view that no action should be taken. It was reported somewhat later that Ibn Saud was pressing the Imam to agree to a delimitation of the frontier; a little later still that some sort of a mission, which the King had sent to Asir, was to go on to Sana to treat with the Imam. All information received 9 in the spring and early summer was, as usual, uncertain, but in the autumn there were definite developments. Early in August the Imam’s troops occupied Jebel Arwa, a key position in the Jebel Razih massif, inland from a line between Medi and Jizan, and apparently took thirty hostages from among the local inhabitants. Ibn Saud protested, but got little satisfaction from the Imam, whose first replies were reassuring, but slapdash and equivocal. 35. At the beginning of September the Hejazi Government took soundings in Jedda and London as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in case what they represented as an unprovoked aggression by the Imam should lead to a conflict, and they moved troops to Asir, including a force of tribesmen under the redoubtable leader Khalid-bin-Lowai and 200 men who were embarked in a British ship for Jizan. His Majesty’s Government had no intention of inter vening in the event of hostilities, and an intimation in this sense was conveyed to the Hejazi Minister in London; but they urged counsels of moderation on Ibn Saud, and expressed the hope in a telegram to Rome that the Italian Govern ment would take similar action with the Imam. The Italians agreed, although on this occasion they seemed to take a very moderate view of the situation and appeared to think that it was not a matter of aggression by the Imam, but of internal trouble in Asir resulting from its absorption by Ibn Saud in defiance of the wishes of the tribes. The Hejazis on their side alleged early in September that the Imam had made a further advance. They thanked His Majesty’s Government for their friendly advice, but justified their own attitude, and communicated to His Majesty’s Government correspondence showing how strenuously moderate Ibn Saud had been. There appeared in the middle of September to be all the makings of a little war. There was talk in Mecca of a further advance by the Imam; it was even rumoured in Mecca that Jizan had fallen. Not many days later a change came over the situation, when it was announced unexpectedly that Ibn Saud had made and the Imam had accepted proposals for a conference of delegates to determine the frontier and adjust differences. Little more of any importance was heard of the matter until December 14th, when the Hejazi Government issued a communique stating that the delegates had reached a deadlock over the question of Jebel Arwa, that the Imam had thereupon asked Ibn Saud to arbitrate, and that the King, desiring peace, the avoidance of bloodshed and co-operation among Arabs, had given judgment against himself. It was left to the delegates to proceed with the discussion of minor matters, including the question of tribal allegiance. They worked with such surprising expedition that a further communique of the 22nd December announced the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship, “ Bon- Voisinage ” and Extradition, which had been signed at Abu Arish’ on the 15th December. The publication of the text was deferred pending ratification. However agreeable and pious the formula by which he escaped from the difficulty over Jebel Arwa and paved the way for a treaty, it cannot be supposed that Ibn Saud accepted with equanimity what was in effect a humiliating surrender to the Imam. Little reliance is placed in Arabia on the sincerity of either side, and some significance was attached to the fact, if it is a fact, that no publicity was given in Sana to the settlement, which, on the other hand was advertised with some ostentation in the Hejaz. The episode indicates a weakening in Ibn Saud’s general position in the latter part of 1931. In deciding to adopt a conciliatory attitude, he may have been influenced by an exaggerated idea of the support which Italy might be giving or might give to the Imam; a little, possibly, by the knowledge that the members of Nuri Pasha’s mission who went on from Jedda to Sana in April had concluded a treaty between the Yemen and Iraq. 37. Although Asir has become a dependency of the Hejaz, it will be convenient to deal in this section with other matters affecting it! Little can be said with confidence regarding the development of the internal situation in 1931.There was nothing to indicate a failure on Ibn Saud's part to establish his authority over the province as a whole, but he was certainly up against tribal opposition, notably on the part of the unruly Masariha tribe in the region inland from Jizan. It is probable that in sending forces to Asir he was as much concerned with the necessity for controlling the tribes as with that of parrying danger from the Yemen. The objects were, in any case, closely allied, as tribes opposed to Ibn Saud would naturally look to the Imam for support, and the trouble with the latter was definitely ascribed by the Hejazi Government to his interference outside his own domain. One of the many stories which reached Jedda was that the advance of Khalid-al-Lowai was seriously delayed by tribal opposition in the north of Asir, but Ibn Saud would appear to have got the local situation in hand by October. 38. Two further points may be noted in connexion with the Asir situation, namely, that, when expressing their views on the situation between Ibn Saud and the Imam, the Italian Government made considerable play with the hostility of the local tribes, especially the Masariha, to the King’s annexation of Asir, and that one of those concerned in the question of Asir would appear to be Seyyid Ahmed-es-Senussi, who continues to reside under Ibn Saud’s wing in the Hejaz and who is related to the Idrisi family. This relationship was reinforced, it would appear, in June by the marriage of Marghani-al-Idrisi to a daughter of Seyyid Ahmed. There was, however, no indication during the year that the Idrisi shadow-ruler of Asir himself played any role at all. 39. The new situation resulting from Ibn Saud’s practical annexation of Asir engaged the attention of His Majesty's Government early in the year. It was reviewed in a letter addressed by the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office and the India Office on the 14th February, which analysed the legal situation with special reference to the effect of the King’s action on the status of Asir and to the treaty of 1917 between Great Britain and the Idrisi. The Foreign Secretary inclined to the view that the Idrisi must be regarded as having been extinguished as an international person, and that the 1917 treaty, even if it had not previously ceased to operate for other reasons, must be held to have lapsed. Having regard to the more general considerations, however, including those connected with the agreements entered into with the Italian Government in the Rome conversation in 1927, Mr. Henderson proposed, subject to the concurrence of the departments addressed, to instruct His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda not to commit His Majesty’s Government to recognition of the absorption of Asir by Ibn Saud, or to do anything wdiich might imply such recognition without further instructions. It was given as an additional reason for maintaining intact the position regarding the 1917 treaty, that it might still be possible to invoke it usefully in the event of a revival of some measure of Idrisi independence. Before this proposal had become effective, a new turn was given to the matter by an innocent-like note to the Legation, dated the 11th March, in which the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs asked for assistance in the establishment of wireless communication between Jizan and Aden for commercial purposes and a postal service between Jizan and Kamaran. In view of the difficulty of dealing with this request without explicitly refusing to recognise the new status of Asir, or at least tacitly acquiescing in it both de jure and de jcvcto, the Foreign Office modified their previous view. They proposed to seek the concurrence of the Italian Government in their officially recognising the new arrangements, having regard to the change which had come over the situation since 1927, and the practical obstacles in the way of refusing to communicate with the Hejazi Government regarding Asir. The Italian Government were in due course approached on those lines with the concurrence of the other departments of His Majesty’s Government concerned. The immediate reaction of the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs was unfavourable. Their objections were later reduced to writing in a lengthy memorandum of the 25th June, the main thesis of which was that the annexation of Asir by Ibn Saud only aggravated the situation which existed at the time of the Rome conversations of 1927, a situation even then pregnant with danger of conflict between Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya. The Italian Government demurred to an assumption in the memorandum which had been addressed to them that they would themselves have to accept the absorption of Asir into the Hejaz in the treaty whish they were negotiating with Ibn Saud [7104] ^ c 2■BHBKRt 20 40. His Majesty’s Government decided, in deference to those Italian objections to postpone any formal recognition of the new status of Asir, but felt that they could not abstain from corresponding with the Hejazi Government on matters affecting the territory. On the 22nd July His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome was instructed to inform the Italian Government in this sense; and His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda to intimate the assent of His Majesty’s ** Government to the proposed wireless communication between Jizan and Aden, and the absence of any objection on their part to the establishment of a postal service between Jizan and Kamaran. It was realised that this answer would involve a de facto recognition of the position of the Hejazi Government as regards Asir, but His Majesty’s Government preferred to avoid any mention at all of the question of recognition, whether de jure or de facto. His Majesty’s representatives in due course addressed the necessary communications to the Italian and Hejazi Governments. The communication made in Rome explained that, while His Majesty’s Government were refraining from formal recognition in deference to the Italian view, they still considered that Asir had, in fact, become a part of Ibn Saud’s dominions both de facto and de jure. It glided lightly over the fact that His Majesty’s Government would henceforward feel compelled to correspond with the Hejazi Government on matters affecting Asir, but made it clear that a reply was being sent to the Hejazi note regarding the particular matter which had given rise to the discussion. The communication made to the Hejazi Government was supplemented on the 8th August by a note expressing the assumption that the proposed postal service with Kamaran would be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Universal Postal Convention and subsidiary agreements, as far as these might apply. On the 31st August, the Colonial Office instructed the Acting Resident at Aden to go into the details of the Jizan-Aden wireless service, as regards wave-length, &amp;c., with the Hejazi Government through His Majesty’s representative in Jedda. (4) States in the South and South-East of Arabia. 41. There were no signs during 1931 of any overt activity on the part of Ibn Saud in regard to the various sheikhdoms, &amp;c., strung along the coast from the Aden Protectorate to Qatr. He probably maintains some vague connexion with them, but cannot be accused of any interference in the Aden Protectorate or of any breach of his undertaking in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda in regard to the Sheikhs of Qatr and the Oman Coast. 42. No serious difficulty arose regarding the numerous Hadhramis settled in the Hejaz, whom the Legation in Jedda would be entitled to protect, if actually born in British or British protected territory, but with whom it in practice concerns itself as little as possible on grounds of policy. In January Sir A. Ryan took up the case of one Hadhrami, who had suffered prolonged imprisonment, and was alleged to have been treated cruelly, but he preferred to deal with it by way of a personal appeal to the Viceroy on the occasion of the anniversary of the King’s accession, and the man was released shortly after. Many Hadhramis were affected by the closing down of the money changers’ shops in Jedda and Mecca in May, but there were no sufficient grounds for diplomatic intervention, which would probably have been useless in any case. A visit to Jedda in April by the Protectorate secretary at Aden provided the opportunity for an exchange of views between him and Sir A. Ryan regarding matters of common interest. Nothing emerged which seemed to call for action with the Hejazi Government. An understanding was reached as to how matters arising in the Hejaz in regard to persons belonging by origin to the Protectorate should be dealt with. This^was confirmed in due course by the Resident at Aden. It was in the nature of a local agreement between the British authorities concerned, as there was no active question of sufficient importance to require reference to His Majesty’s Government. J ^ 43. The successful crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali by Mr. Bertram Thomas suggested to the ingenious brain of Mr. Philby that it might be necessary for Ibn baud to protect himself against the possibility of excessive territorial claims by the bultan of Muscat and Oman. There were no signs of the Kino- having taken this seriously. ° 8(5) Bahrein and Koweit. 44. The reasons given in paragraph 47 of the annual report for 1930 for dealing together with Ibn Sand’s relations with these two sheikhdoms still hold good. There was no change in 1931 in the legal situation in regard to them. The various inter-connected questions arising out of their position vis-a-vis Hejaz- Nejd remained unresolved, and they still fall to be dealt with by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in the absence of any formal political relations between Ibn Sand and the sheikhs. Ibn Saud continued to maintain his commercial agents at Bahrein and Koweit. There were no signs of any development in his unofficial or personal relations with the sheikhs of Bahrein, but early in the year there was a certain rapprochement between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. They reached a satisfactory agreement over at least one tiresome though insignificant question of frontier camels. The King invited the sheikh to come on pilgrimage, and his eldest son, the Amir Saud, sought the honour of escorting him to the Holy Land. The invitation was declined for financial reasons. 45. The whole position in regard to the complex of Persian Gulf questions was overshadowed in 1930 by the attitude of personal hostility which the King had taken up towards the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. This affair had taken a happier turn towards the end of that year, but it still remained to make the reconciliation effective by bringing about a meeting between them. His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda had written on the 28th December suggesting that Colonel Biscoe should pay a visit to Ibn Saud in Nejd, where the King then was, a visit which was projected on the British side as one of courtesy only, though it was hoped that the King himself might take the initiative in discussing business. 46. Ibn Saud’s then visit to Nejd was a short one. Even if he had been keen, it would have been difficult for him to receive the Political Resident, all the more so as it would have been contrary to his policy to do so at Riadh, no place, in his view, for Europeans. On the 28th January, having returned to Mecca, he wrote a friendly letter to Sir A. Ryan expressing regret that he had been unable to arrange the matter in Nejd, but offering to receive Colonel Biscoe at Jedda. This invitation could not be accepted for practical reasons of distance, &amp;c., apart from any other considerations. A suitably polite explana tion of the Resident’s inability to accept it was conveyed to His Majesty and was confirmed to him personally by Sir A. Ryan at his audience of the 2nd March. The King received it most amiably, and hopes were expressed on both sides that the visit might take place later when His Majesty should be again in Nejd. He added spontaneously that he would be prepared to discuss matters of common interest. The matter rested there for the remainder of the year. On the 17th June Sir A. Ryan reminded the King of his promise, and the King left for Nejd soon after. Up to the end of December, however, he had not gone to Hasa, although at a friendly meeting between Colonel Biscoe and the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London on the 21st July Sheikh Hafiz Wahba held out a hope of His Majesty’s being in that neighbourhood in September. 47. On the 13th May Colonel Biscoe reported to the Colonial Office on a question about which he had been in communication with the Sheikh of Koweit for some time, but which had not loomed very large among the “ Persian Gulf questions” in 1930, namely, that of old Koweiti claims against Nejd under various counts. The sheikh had put these at the modest figure of 111,58,190 rupees. He had been induced to scale them down to 14,86,590 rupees, a more moderate figure, which still, however, represented something like £110,000. Colonel Biscoe considered the claims as restated to be incontestable. He inclined in principle to the view that a claim for the amount should be put forward through the Legation in Jedda, but suggested that a decision should be post poned pending consultation with himself and Sir A. Ryan when on leave in London. Eventually this and other questions which had been under consideration in anticipation of a meeting between the Political Resident and Ibn Saud were reviewed on the 12th August at an inter-departmental conference at the Eoreign Office, at which Colonel Biscoe, Colonel Dickson, the Political Agent at Koweit, and Sir A. Ryan were present. Views were exchanged regarding the mode of negotiation with Ibn Saud, the embargo on trade with Koweit, the proposals for [7104] c 3an agreement between Hejaz-Nejd and Koweit on some such lines as those of the Bahra Agreement between Nejd and Iraq, the question of the old Koweiti claims referred to above, the effect of the Hejaz-Nejd law on nationality as regards Koweitis and Bahreinis, and, subsidiarily, a question which had been raised by the Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad as to the future status of Koweit, with special reference to the possibility of its eventual incorporation in Iraq. 48. In regard to the last of these questions, which concerns only indirectly the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud, the conference relied on the view taken by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1929 that no change in the then status of Koweit should be contemplated, either as regards identifying it with Iraq or declaring a formal British Protectorate until circumstances should appear to make this clearly desirable. As regards the other questions, the main conclusions were as follows: The way should be paved by the proposed visit of courtesy to be paid by Colonel Biscoe, accompanied by Colonel Dickson, to Ibn Saud, at which, it was hoped, outstanding questions might be discussed informally. Further procedure would depend on the result of this first meeting, but, generally speaking, the aim was that any more formal subsequent negotiations should be conducted^ if possible, by the Political Resident with Ibn Saud personally and that the Sheikh of Koweit should be present, rather than that they should be conducted by the Legation in Jedda, or with a Hejazi delegation or by the Sheikh of Koweit himself. Importance was attached to the removal by Ibn Saud of his embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. It was not thought necessary for His Majesty’s Government to shrink from the questions which, it was understood, the King himself might raise regarding dues collected in Bahrein on goods destined for Nejd, his vaguely indicated desiderata in connexion with the position of hm subjects in the Persian Gulf, or the position of his agents in Bahrein and Koweit. It seemed unlikely, however, that satisfaction could be given him on these points, and it was contemplated as a possibility that, if he proved recalcitrant over the embargo, a threat to raise the transit dues at Bahrein might be used delicately as a means of pressure. It was agreed that the question of an agreement for the settlement of future raiding claims (which had been thought of as something roughly analogous to the Bahra Agreement with Iraq) need not be pursued, having regard to the facilities afforded by tribal custom for the adjustment of such matters and the fact that this custom had on recent occasions been applied by the authorities on both sides (as in the case referred to briefly in paragraph 44 above). It was further agreed to continue to hold over the sheikh’s claim in respect of past incidents and transactions, lest its presentation at a time when Ibn Saud could not possibly meet it should appear to him merely as an unfriendly gesture. It was thought that it might, if presented prematurely, even frighten him off the proposed meeting with Colonel Biscoe. The case for dealing with the matter in conjunction with the other questions was all the stronger as the sheikh had intimated readiness to waive the claim altogether if Ibn Saud would remove the embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. The one remaining question, that of the nationality of Bahreinis and Koweitis in Hejaz-Nejd, was also reserved. 49. Although the conference of the 12th August afforded an useful opportunity of crystallising the position in regard to the various questions discussed, it subordinated practically all of them, as far as relations with Hejaz-Nejd were concerned, to the results of the meeting between Colonel Biscoe j I | )n , Saud - further progress was made with them, therefore, up to the end of the year, when the meeting was still being awaited in the circumstances already described. 50. There were no signs during the year of any substantial progress in connexion with the schemes mooted in 1930 for the creation of a port in Neid territory at Ras Tanura, or the organisation of a pilgrim and trade route from the Hasa Coast to the Hejaz, projects which, if realised, would have an important effect on Bahrein. On the 28th February Ibn Saud admitted to Sir A. Ryan at a party at Mr. Philby’s house, that it was intended to bore for water at Ras Tanura but it is not known what, if anything, was done up to the end of the year In April the Persian Charge d’Affaires in Jedda spoke of the idea of an overland route from Hasa to the Hejaz side as one which had been discussed, but could notbe regarded as practical politics for the time being. It may have been still further side-tracked by the subsequent proposals for a similar route from Iraq (see paragraph 154). 51. Pn the latter part of the year the Sheikh of Koweit had reason to complain of various intrusions into his territory by unauthorised parties of Nejdis, headed or sent by Ibn Saud’s frontier officials. They were guilty of various small acts of aggression and inquisition, which became the subject of correspondence between the Political Resident, His Majesty’s Government and the Legation in Jedda, but not up to the end of the year of representations to the Hejazi Government. 52. Three other matters may be mentioned briefly as follows:— (a) On the 10th February the Legation forwarded to Bushire a draft tor £3,000, being Koweit’s share in the £10,000 divided between her and Iraq in the circumstances related ih paragraph 11 (a). (b) It was decided not to raise with the Hejazi Government the question which had arisen in 1930 regarding the attitude of the local authorities in Hasa towards Bahreinis. There had been an improvement in the situation on the spot, and all the British authorities concerned agreed that, so long as no acute question arose, it would be better to leave the matter to be dealt with locally as far as possible, rather than embark on a diplomatic discussion which might open up thorny legal issues. (c) Late in the year the Political Agent at Bahrein agreed to a proposal of the agents of the British India Company at Karachi, in that they should refuse goods for overside transhipment at Bahrein. Under arrangements made in 1920, goods transhipped in this way do not pay the 2 per cent, transit duty levied on goods landed for reshipment to Nejd. The increased use made of this exemption in the summer of 1930 had deprived Bahrein of revenue and the local Indian merchants of middlemen’s profits. A question later arose as to whether the Political Agent’s action might not be contested as being contrary to undertakings given to Ibn Sand when the transit duty of 2 per cent, was fixed. It appeared that the existing transit arrangements were the result of representations made by him, and that, on the 14th July, 1920, the then Political Agent in Bahrein informed him by letter that only 2 per cent., instead of the ordinary import duty of 5 per cent., would be charged on goods in transit, and that no duty would be charged on goods unloaded from steamers direct into lighters pro ceeding to the mainland. It was not, however, until 1932 that the question of the propriety from a legal point of view of the British India Company’s proposal matured. (b) Relations with Powers outside Arabia. (1) British Empire. (a) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 53. Ibn Saud’s partial compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government in connexion with the Transjordan frontier, and their own grace in side-stepping out of an extreme position, averted what might have been an acute breach between the two parties. There was, nevertheless, a gradual deterioration of their relations during 1931. The frontier question was only one of several questions in which the attitude of His Majesty’s Government or the Legation in Jedda, determined in each case by the merits of the particular case, could only appear unsympathetic or even hostile to a monarch who sees all these things in a synthesis, and has a large conception of the obligations of friendship? when it is he himself who is looking for friendly offices. The particular questions referred to are dealt with in various special sections of this report. The most important, after that of Transjordan, were, perhaps, those [7104] c 424 58. The King’s desire for a good understanding with His Maiestv’s Government was obviously sincere, if not as disinterested as might have been relative to the Eastern Telegraph Company, the Hejazi Air Force, the raid on the Egyptian Shell Company’s benzine, and the manumission of slaves, but there were several others which necessitated pressure on the Hejazi Government. 54. Two other factors of a more general kind contributed to the strain. One was the aloofness of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom when confronted with advances by the King with the object of getting British backing all along the line, accompanied by professions of his readiness to accommodate His Majesty’s Government in all that they might desire of him. The other was the dislike which the King and some of his advisers had conceived for the British Minister in Jedda. The first of these elements in the situation falls to be considered in some detail in this section; the second more succinctly. 55. The King was greatly startled by the vigour of the action taken in connexion with the Transjordan frontier question at the end of February. His misgivings were increased by the accidental circumstance that His Majesty’s Minister, about the same time, took a strong line about the constant remissness of the Hejazi Government in settling the cable account of the Eastern Telegraph Company. As soon as the correspondence on the former subject had been steered into a more or less normal course, he sent Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, still Acting Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to see Sir A. Ryan on the 1st April. The rr- described the perplexity created in the King’s mind by the recent severity of His Majesty’s Government and their representative. Sir A. Ryan assured him that there was no change in the fundamental attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards Ibn Saud, which was one of friendship. He explained that it was their practice to deal with all questions as they arose on their individual ments. He emphasised the gravity of the Transjordan frontier affair, a matter which might well react unfavourably on general relations, whereas that of the Fastern Telegraph Company was on a lower plane. He showed how careful His Majesty s Government had been not to let the admittedly acute situation to which the frontier question had given rise become further envenomed and how restrained his own action had been in certain other directions. , ™s conversation helped to clear the air. Fuad Bey Hamza returned a fortnight later from sick leave. He was, perhaps, not sorry to have an opportunity of attempting to prove that things would not have gone so far wrong as they had done if he had had the management of them. He was more con versant with the machinery of foreign affairs than Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, a little more independent of the King, and on sufficiently good terms with Sir A Ryan with whom he had always been genuinely friendly, to think that he could build up with the Minister s assistance a new structure of good relations between Ibn Saud and His Majesty s Government. The King was probably all the more ready to listen to him as his internal affairs and his financial situation were going from bad to worse. His Majesty s stay in Jedda from the 14th to 17th June provided i U A?n ty T f ° r a 17 de ^ n ' te demonstration. In two long conversations on the 13th and 16th June Fuad Bey urged the strong desire of the King for a good understanding on all points He analysed what he understood to be the desiderata His Majesty s Government and what he conceived to be those of mh m fnn er ‘ Those interviews paved the way for a two hours’ audience on the 17th June, when Ibn Saud himself explained his point of view to Sir A. Ryan. fripnH 7 r ° f these convers ^ions was that the King looked to his old fnend Great Britain for support, and, if supported, would do anything asked him. He requested Sir A. Ryan’s assistance in arriving at a clear under- v t fl ! ndamental kmd - He referred to possible future changes in an Fuad B^^id a lfr nt ga 7 CaU - Se f °i anxiet y&gt; hinting at a thesis which had stated more plainly, viz., that Ibn Saud could offer a true and useful friendship, whereas there could be no real friendship between Great Britain and Hashimite-ruled countries, where His Majesty’s Government must tnve to maintain a privileged position. He spoke of his desire to use what influence he had elsewhere in a sense favourable to His Majesty’s Government P e 7 as , not . S if e w ing ^/r h ^ Sai( ?’ t? drive a bargain, but he did want to know where he stood with His Majesty’s Government.25 • y i * * t i * «* inferred from his professions of pure friendship. It was equally obvious that both he and Fuad Bey were thinking much of their financial difficulties. Fuad Bey hinted openly on the 13th June at the possibility of financial assistance. The King confined himself to a request for help in enlisting the services of a British bank (see paragraph 130). Sir A. Ryan endeavoured to be sympathetic but was as cautious as the occasion obviously required him to be. He undertook to report faithfully to his Government all that Fuad Bey and the King had said, but he discouraged fantastic hopes and dwelt on the unwillingness of His Majesty s Government to deal ever with hypothetical issues. He promised to follow the matter up personally in London when on leave. 59. The event justified this guarded attitude. The Foreign Office were unwilling to commit themselves to any general statement in reply to Ibn Saud’s appeal. It was, indeed, evident that they could not help the King in any way that would be really useful to him. Financial assistance was precluded by the critical situation at home, apart from any other considerations, a fact which was made abundantly clear to the Hejazi Minister in London in August and September, when he broached the subject on lines of his own in private conver sations with the head of the Eastern Department and Sir A. Ryan. It was equally clear that, even if His Majesty’s Government were prepared to follow Ibn Saud into hypothetical issues regarding the political future of Arabia, he could not be encouraged to hope that they would abandon pour ses beaux yeux their patronage of the Hashimite rules of Iraq and Transjordan. 60. The upshot of the matter was that His Majesty’s Minister returned to Jedda in December with full material for a general statement of the conclusions which he had himself formed as a result of his discussions in London, but without any more authentic expression of His Majesty’s Government’s views. At the end of the year he was still awaiting an opportunity of resuming his conversations with Fuad Bey, not in the hope that they would lead anywhere, but with the object of showing that the King’s appeal had not been ignored, however difficult it might be to gratify his wishes. In the interval Ibn Saud’s position had become more precarious than ever and fresh obstacles had come in the way of completely cordial relations between him and His Majesty’s Government, e.g., his failure to interest any British bank in his affairs, the collapse of the proposals to restaff his air force with British personnel, and the commandeering of the Shell benzine. A couple of awkward slavery cases in December did nothing to improve matters, although it was not until January 1932 that one of them became so acute as to strain relations almost to breaking-point. 61. The other factor of a general kind mentioned above cannot be disregarded, but may be dealt with rather more briefly. Even in 1930 Sir A. Ryan had become somewhat of a persona ingrata in the eyes of Ibn Saud owing to the frankness of his language on certain occasions, a frankness without which it would be impossible to get anything at all out of the Hejazi Govern ment. An unfortunate incident at the end of January contributed, no doubt, to the legend of the Minister’s harshness, though it is probable that it was not brought to the King’s notice at the time. His son, the Amir Feisal, had in December 1930 become Minister for Foreign Affairs without ceasing to be Viceroy of the Hejaz. Sir A. Ryan’s first business visit to him in his new capacity was fixed for the 30th January. When the Minister got to the Palace there was no one of any sort to receive him. This was due, it speedily appeared, to bad management rather than to any deliberate discourtesy, but the slight was too serious to be ignored, having regard to the nature of the occasion and the risk of its being supposed that a prince need not bother much about a British represen tative. An adequate apology was extracted with some slight difficulty. This closed the incident within a few hours, but it doubtless left a bad taste in Hejazi mouths. The necessary vigour of Sir A. Ryan’s language at his audience with the King on the 2nd March, when he was instructed to use all the force at his command to impress on the King the gravity of the Transjordan frontier situation, outraged the King’s personal feelings, all the more as he and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin were very ready to suppose that the Minister had inspired the instructions on which he was acting. In the June conversations Fuad Bey Hamza made no secret of the fact that the King was seriously indisposed towards26 Sir A. Ryan and evinced a strong desire to restore their relations. On the 17th June the Minister went out of his way to express the friendliness ot his personal dispositions. This, aided by the interested but not insincere co-opera tion of Fuad Bey, probably did something to re-establish Sir A. Ryan in the good graces of His Majesty, but Ibn Saud is too vindictive a man to do more than forgive. He will not forget an injury, real or imaginary. At the most he was prepared to tolerate a representative whose language he had disliked, subject to good conduct in future. The sequel to the story belongs to the early part of 1932. 62. It must not be supposed that throughout this period of tension the relations of His Majesty’s Government and the Legation with Ibn baud and his Government were other than correct. The King’s outward attitude towaids Sir A. Ryan did not cease to be gracious, and he knows too well on what side his bread is buttered to quarrel with His Majesty’s Government more than his own obstinacy and the unwisdom of his advisers so frequently cause him to do. There were, indeed, moments of cordiality. In the realm of pure courtesy, Ibn Saud had the satisfaction of receiving on the 8th January, the anniversary of his accession to the Throne of the Hejaz, a personal telegram of congratulation from King George V, an attention which it was decided to bestow after anxious consideration by His Majesty’s Government of its suitability from the point of view of precedent. Later in that month the King finally overcame his resentment against the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to the extent of consenting to receive a visit from Colonel Biscoe, and suggesting that it might be paid in Jedda rather than stand over until he himself could go to Nejd (see paragraphs 45 and 46). The successful termination of the negotiations with Iraq led to an exchange of courtesies between the King and the Hejazi personages on the one hand and His Majesty’s Government and their representatives in Bagdad and Jedda on the other. On the latter occasion the King expressed proper gratitude, and with every appearance of sincerity, for the efforts of His Majesty s Govern ment and the British intermediaries to promote an understanding between him and Iraq. By a happy accident a present of wireless sets, which Sir F. Humphrys had promised him as a memento of the 4 c Lupin Conference, but which had been delayed, arrived just about the time of the conclusion of the final negotiations with Iraq; and the gift was accompanied by an expression of the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government, in addition to that of the High Commissioner’s personal sentiments. 63. Even after making allowance, however, for these brighter features, it must be admitted that the situation between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud towards the end of the year was none too happy. It may pertinently be asked whether its deterioration’was due in any measure to foreign influences. The answer is almost certainly in the negative. No Power other than Great Britain carries much weight with the King. It would be repugnant to his sentiments to throw himself into the arms of Soviet Russia, though a mild flirtation does not come amiss, if it gets a man cheap benzine. Othei gieat Powers hardly count, politically, in Ibn Sand’s sphere, except in so far as it gratifies him to have their recognition and to be able to point to treaty relations with them as a hall-mark of the respectability of his position among the nations. His relations with one of them, Italy, are tinged with mistrust of her pretensions in the Red Sea and her association with the Imam Yahya. To the lesser European Powers he can look only for advantages of a non-political nature, such as financial transactions with the Dutch, who have a strong business interest in the Hejaz owing to the pilgrimage or a deal in arms with Poland like that which was brought off in 1930. As for his neighbours or quasi-neighbours in the Middle East, there is none whose support he could ask without oveicoming personal distaste and ambition on his own side or else indifference on the other. He hates Egypt and Iraq and Transjordan. Persia is spiritually, if not geographically, remote The Turks have gone too European and too irreligious to concern themselves much with the affairs of their lost Arabia beyond watching with interest what goes on there. 64. This is the most convenient place in which to deal with a small number of questions which are of major political interest in connexion with the position between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud, although two of them assumed no acute form in 1931, while the interest attaching to the third was, from theI go 27 point of view of British relations with Hejaz-Nejd, little more than incidental. They are as follows :—- (a) Status of the Aqaha^-Maan District. —This has already been dealt with in its local bearings in paragraph 33 («). It is only necessary to add here that Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned it in the June conversations as an outstanding question which might require attention in considering any general understanding between Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government. Sir A. Ryan suggested that it was much better that it should remain in abeyance on the basis established by the letters annexed to the Treaty of Jedda; whereupon Fuad Bey observed that he was not saying that his Government wished to reopen it for the time being. (b) Hejaz Railway. —On the 6th February Sheikh Yussuf Yasin referred to this question as one which he would like to discuss on some future occasion. Having had reason to believe in 1928 that the King himself was not really anxious to pursue the question, His Majesty’s Government instructed His Majesty’s Minister to ascertain privately whether His Majesty had altered his views. In the conditions now governing diplomatic intercourse in Jedda, it is not easy to approach the King without reference to his advisers, but Sir A. Ryan found means on the 2nd March to pass an informal note to His Majesty during a momentary absence of Sheikh Yussuf Yasin. On the 9th June the King wrote a reply, which he gave to Fuad Bey Hamza to deliver. The gist of it was that the King’s attitude in 1928 was inspired by a wish not to increase difficulties with His Majesty’s Government, with whom he was at the time engaged in other difficult negotiations; that he had not intended to ignore or renounce Islamic lights in the railway, but to postpone the matter to a more convenient opportunity; that this did not preclude efforts being made to determine the Islamic rights in question; and that it was for this reason that Sheikh Yussuf Yasin had raised the question and that the Hejazi Government were compelled to negotiate about it. This appeared to foreshadow an early reopening of the question, but the Hejazi Government did not revert to it during the remainder of the year. In the meantime His Majesty’s Government had been led to review the position in regard to the railway with special reference to the question whether there was any ground for the constantly repeated suggestion that it is a Moslem Wakf. This theory is relied on by all exponents of a Moslem claim to the railway, whether put forward on behalf of Ibn Saud or by others, not necessarily in sympathy with him, on behalf of “the Moslem world.’’ It was reasserted in the following resolution adopted by the Moslem Congress held at Jerusalem in December 1931 :— “ After hearing the report of the committee on the Hejaz Railway and perusing the documents relating thereto, the congress declares its resentment at the usurpation of Moslem property, which is essentially a Wakf. The congress should approach Islamic and other Governments in this regard, and should empower the Executive Committee to discuss other means for the recovery of the line.’’ 65. It can only be said that the examination of the question by His Majesty's Government in consultation with the Embassy in Turkey in 1931 disclosed no evidence whatsoever that the railway had ever been constituted a Wakf. It is true that in August 1914 the Ottoman Government procured a law transferring its administration to the Ministry of Wakfs, but such an administrative change could not of itself have altered the chai actei of the lailway. The constitution of a Wakf is essentially a proceeding which requires an express act having that for its object and executed in accordance with the provisions of a rigorous system of religious law. 66. (c) Moslem Congress in Jerusalem in December.—The proceedings at this congress do not fall within the scope of the present report, except in so far as they related to the subject of the preceding sub-paragraph. One of the antecedent circumstances, however, was that, on the 14th November, Fuad Bey Hamza acting on urgent instructions from Ibn Saud, informed His Majesty s Charge d’Affaires at Jedda that the Grand Mufti of Palestine had invited the Hejazi Government to send representatives and notables to the congress. The Kin^ was impressed bv the probably anti-British and, as he thought, clearly anti-Saudi complexion of the project. He disliked the agenda and was perplexed at receiving such an invitation from a Palestinian official. He was doubtfulwhether to stand aloof or to send a representative to look after his interests. Fuad Bey enquired as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, to whom His Majesty looked for a lead. Other Governments having also approached His Majesty’s Government on the same subject, a generally similar reply was sent to all, subject to adaptations required by the form of the particular representations made. Mr. Hope Gill informed Fuad Bey, on the 21st November, that Flis ^ Majesty’s Government could not advise the King as to whether to send delegates, but that he might like to know that His Majesty’s Government were in no way associated wdth the proposal to hold the Congress; that it had neither then- encouragement nor support; that their attitude was one of detachment, except as regards possible reactions on public security in Palestine; and that the Grand Mufti was doubtless acting as a religious dignitary, not as a Palestinian official. A week later a further communication was made to the effect that, in view of conversations which had passed between the Grand Mufti and the High Commissioner, His Majesty’s Government did not anticipate that political questions would be raised or that the proceedings at the congress would be embarrassing to Ibn Baud. The Grand Mufti, it was added, had given a specific assurance that the Caliphate question would not be broached. Fuad Bey expressed gratitude for this information, but it would appear from publications in the press that, before receiving His Majesty’s Government’s reply, Ibn Baud had made up his mind to discountenance the congress. No delegate was sent, nor does it appear that any notables from Hejaz-Nejd attended. Though Fuad Bey is said to have sent a sympathetic message, and the Mecca newspapers showed guarded interest, it is evident that the whole affair was repugnant to Ibn Baud. Apart from the danger of criticism of his regime in the Hejaz, which was, in fact, denounced in due course in a leaflet circulated at the congress, he had other reasons for his attitude. He detests the Indian agitator, Shauqat Ali, who was one of the moving spirits. He claims to be the only Simon Pure of Islam, and has himself had no use for Moslem conferences since he held one in Mecca in 1926. The whole affair had enough of a Hashimite complexion to arouse his mistrust. And he may have been impressed by the view held in some quarters that one of the objects of the promoters was to make Jerusalem, rather than a Mecca in the hands of sectaries, the centre of the Moslem world. 67. In the portion of the annual report for 1930, which dealt with the Aqaba-Maan and Hejaz Railway questions, mention was made of the role played by Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby in regard to them. As no report on Hejaz-Nejd is complete without some reference to this gentleman, this opportunity is taken of bringing up to date the account there given of his general activities. During 1931 he resided principally at Mecca, paying occasional visits to Jedda, and going further afield from time to time in connexion with the Marconi wireless installation, or in quest of Ibn Baud’s society at Taif and in Nejd. He made his first pilgrimage in April. Towards the end of the year he followed the King to the Hasa Coast. He thus maintained his position in Ibn Baud’s entourage/but during the summer and autumn his sentiments of complete devotion to the King and belief in his system underwent a change. When the successful accomplish ment of Mr. Bertram Thomas’s journey across the Ruba-al-Khali was announced, Mr. Philby was immeasurably disappointed at not having been himself the first to achieve it; and he accused Ibn Baud of having refused him permission to make the attempt after previously promising to grant it. He had no little trouble over the Marconi affair, and found himself in an awkward position between the company and the Hejazi Government. The financial methods of the Hejazis involved his own concern, Sharqieh (Limited), in grave difficulties. The stock of benzine belonging to the Standard Oil Company, which Sharqieh represents, was raided as mercilessly as that belonging to Eigyptian Shell. He played a leading part in the attempt by Fuad Bey Hamza and others to displace the Director-General of Finance in the autumn. Altogether, Sheikh Abdullah Philby spent ther second half of the year in a state of sad disillusionment: a disillusionment so great that he ceased to write news letters to the “ Near East ” lest he should have only evil to say of his friends. 68. It is of some importance to get Mr. Philby into a true perspective, in view of the increasing tendency of certain sections of the European press to represent him as playing a great role in Arabia. As a European he burnt his29 boats finally by turning Moslem in 1930. It would be hard for him to swing away definitely from Ibn Saud, even if he wished to. He remains, therefore, a hanger on, perhaps still faithful to the King, but in many ways disgruntled. The King probably likes to have him about, and consults him doubtless on occasion; but there was no slightest sign of his being in the know when the Transjordan frontier question was acute, nor has he found it more possible than other traders of late to get money out of the Hejazi Government. His real influence must therefore be rated low. His capacity for affairs cannot be rated high. To represent him as a member of Ibn Baud’s Government, as an eminence grise, or as a “ mystery man of Arabia,” is absurd. He is merely, poor man, a person of considerable parts, some attractive qualities, and a taste for the unusual, adventuring himself in an alien world, in which he has thrown away his old compass to experiment with a new one. In the latter part of 1931, he still ached to cross the Ruba-al-Khali, approaching it in such a way that the exploit, though second to that of Mr. Thomas, would compare with, or even excel, it in magnitude. 69. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba continued to be Hejazi Minister in London throughout 1931. His part in official affairs was inconsiderable, but, so far as it went, helpful. He was much in evidence on social occasions, and showed ability as a propagandist on behalf of Ibn Saud. (b) Other British Governments. 70. Hejaz-Nejd continued during the year to have no contact with any of the Dominions. A few questions primarily concerning the Governments of British dependencies fall to be dealt with in this section, as follows :— (a) Hejazi Consuls at Bombay and Singapore. —His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda discussed this question with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin on the 7th February, the Governments of India and the Straits Settlements having agreed in principle to accept the proposed consuls subject to certain safeguards, and Sir A. Ryan having been authorised to couple his statement of their desiderata with the expression of a hope that, if the consuls were agreed to, Ibn Saud would be equally prepared to receive British consuls in his dominions. It emerged from the conversation that the sheikh was reluctant to agree to the suggested restric tions on the activity of the consuls and that the idea of reciprocity was most unpalatable. He promised to report to the King, but the Hejazi Government did not revert to the subject during the remainder of the year. (b) Money Order Agreements with India and Palestine. —For some time previous to 1931 negotiations had been proceeding with a view to the conclusion of money order agreements between Hejaz-Nejd and these two countries. They had gone very slowly, largely owing to the difficulty of the Hejazi Government in agreeing to clauses providing for the payment of interest on debit balances outstanding for more than a certain period, a provision repugnant to their religious convictions. This question was eventually settled as between Hejaz- Nejd and Palestine by a formula to be embodied in an exchange of letters providing for the payment of interest under another name, and the agreement was completed in the summer of 1931. The Indian postal authorities waived the question of interest The negotiations were completed in the latter part of the year, but the actual exchange of signed texts was delayed by slight hitches of a purely formal kind. (c) Claim by the Government of India. —This is dealt with in the section on finance, &amp;c. (2) France and Syria. 71. The treaty negotiations between France and Hejaz-Nejd dragged on wearily throughout the first ten months of the year. They were conducted on the French side by M. R. Maigret, who continued during the year to be Charge d’Affaires at the head of a consulate. He complained bitterly of the tiresomeness of the Hejazi negotiators, first Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, whom he found incon ceivably meticulous over words, and then Fuad Bey Hamza. A general treaty with France was eventually signed on the 10th November, and simultaneously a new convention on the relations between Hejaz-Nejd and the States of Syria and the Lebanon. These agreements had not been ratified or published up to the end30 of the year. It is known that the French, in deference to strong Hejazi objections, relinquished the attempt to insert an article binding Ibn baud to co-operate in the suppression of the slave trade. Otherwise the treaty is under stood to be on the same lines as the Treaty of Jedda between Great Britain and Hejaz-Nejd. His Majesty’s Legation had no information up to the end of the ^ year as to how the French had turned, if they succeeded in turning, what ^ M. Maigret represented in January as being then the main difficulty, that of the nationality of Algerians settled in Medina, a question to which the French Government attached importance, but which did not seem to be solved by the amendments introduced into the Hejazi Law on Nationality in Jebruary 1931 (see paragraph 172). The Syrian Convention was intended to replace that of March 1926, which was originally concluded for two years and had been provisionally renewed more than once, but had apparently fallen into abeyance some time before the conclusion of the recent treaty negotiations. 72. There is little else to record under this head. France continued to have few interests in the Hejaz, where there are no settled Jrench citizens of European race outside the consulate. M. Maigret lived more and more the life of a hermit crab as the year wore on. Rear-Admiral Deville, Commander-in- chief of the French naval division in the Levant, visited Jedda on the 18th February, towards the end of a long journey by land and sea through Syria and Iraq and down the Persian Gulf. He came in a naval yacht, made no splash and left on the 20th February. Very few pilgrims came from French North Africa, mainly owing to the action of the French authorities in Algeria, who prohibited the pilgrimage from that country on the ground of the prevalence of plague. 73. It was suggested to Sir A. Ryan by the Italian consul in the early summer that the French were at loggerheads with Ibn Saud over the question of the hospitality extended by the latter to the Druze refugees under Sultan Al-Atrash (see paragraph 33 (b )). This report may have been true, but there was no confirmation of it. (3) Italy. 74. Italy, like France, resumed her negotiations for a general treaty with Ibn Saud early in the year. Like France, she abandoned all hope of securing an article relative to the suppression of the slave trade. The negotiations followed a slow though fairly promising course for some months, but had not been completed when M. Sollazzo, the Italian consul in charge of them, went on leave on the 19th July. He returned to Jedda on the 11th October with instructions to delay matters owing to the uncertain situation which had arisen between Hejaz- Nejd and the Yemen. The settlement of the quarrel between these two in December removed this difficulty, and an early resumption of the negotiations was in prospect at the end of the year. 75. Both sides were reticent as to the details of the intended treaty. One sidelight was thrown on the matter by the correspondence between the British and Italian Governments regarding the status of Asir. As has been stated in paragraph 39, the Italians demurred to an assumption on the part of His Majesty’s Government that, if the treaty with Ibn Saud were concluded, they would have to recognise his absorption of that territory. The Italian Foreign Office had shown strong hostility to any such recognition by Great Britain, and in their memorandum of the 25th June, 1931, they explicitly stated that recognition on their part would not ensue from the proposed treaty. It seems probable that, as both sides were equally anxious in 1931 to come to terms, subject to the Italian difficulty over the Imam Yahya in the autumn, they were prepared to use forms of expression which would not compromise their respective points of view. It may be noted in this connexion that it may have been easier in 1931 than at an earlier period for the Italians to disregard the possibility of its being held that Asir had become one of the dependencies included in the official description “ Kingdom (or Kingdoms) of the Hejaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies,” for the final arrangements made by Ibn Saud in 1930 definitely placed Asir under the authority of the Viceroy of the Hejaz. So long, therefore, as a distinction is maintained between the Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies, it might be argued that the latter expression could not include Asir, which had32 Dutch East Indies owing to the large part played by Hadhramis in their commercial life and the politico-religious rivalries between sections of their Moslem population. 79. It appears to be contrary to the policy of the Netherlands Government to enter into treaty relations with Ibn Saud as long as this can be avoided. Their relations with him are, however, eminently friendly. The proposed arrangements for establishing full diplomatic intercourse were completed in principle in July, when the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London was appointed in the same capacity at The Hague, one of the Al-Fadhl family appointed first secretary in charge of the Legation there and a consul appointed to Batavia. These arrangements had not taken effect up to the end of the year, probably owing to the difficulty of financing them. Indeed, the Al-Fadhl earmarked for Holland was subsequently given another post in Jedda. As regards the consul at Batavia, it is interesting to note that the proposal to appoint one was mooted at about the same time as that to send consuls to Bombay and Singapore (see paragraph 70 (a)). The Netherlands authorities at first seemed disposed to block it, but would appear to have ended by giving their consent in accordance with their general policy of following the line of least resistance in matters affecting Ibn Saud and the interest of their Moslem subjects in the pilgrimage. 80. The great diminution in the number of pilgrims from Java, which is referred to elsewhere, has been a severe blow to the Hejaz, as the Dutch East Indian pilgrims had previously been the most important, the most prosperous and perhaps the most manageable single element in the pilgrimage. Ibn Saud showed his politic consideration for them in 1931 by undertaking to finance the repatria tion of some ninety destitute Javanese pilgrims. Destitution on this scale was a new feature, and the Dutch Legation in Jedda had no funds at their disposal with which to cope with it. 81. The Islamised Dutchman, Van de Poll, who had lived many years in Jedda, built up an important business and cut a certain figure, left the Hejaz in the summer to settle in Algeria. His business, the principal element in which was the agency for the British and Dutch Blue Funnel Lines, was reorganised as a mixed Anglo-Dutch concern under the name of International Agencies (Limited). (5) Soviet Russia. 82. There were again no signs in 1931 of Soviet diplomatic activity of a purely political nature in the Hejaz, or of any definite efforts to promote communism by means of unofficial agents in the Holy Cities. In the summer, however, the Russian Minister, M. Touracoulov, became commercially active and made several visits to Mecca. His main objective, or, at any rate, his one visible achievement, was a deal in petroleum products, the way for which was prepared by the non-renewal of the contract between the Government and the Egyptian Shell Company, which had expired at the end of 1930, and the failure of negotiations with other interests, including those represented by the German consul, M. de Haas, who at one time seemed to be on the point of securing a contract to supply Roumanian products. In or about July the Russian Minister obtained an order for some £30,000 worth of benzine and kerosene. It is believed that the original arrangement provided for payment in four equal instalments, the first to be paid on delivery, the remainder at intervals of two months. The Soviet Legation subsequently agreed to easier terms, with the result that, although the benzine, &amp;c., was delivered in Jedda in two consignments on the 20th October and the 26th November, no payment had been made up to the end of the year. 83. This transaction was said to have been to some extent forced on the Hejazi Government by the Soviet Minister, who was understood to be pursuing at the same time the larger object of inducing Ibn Saud to remove the restrictions on Russian trade generally. The precise operation of those restrictions is not very easy to determine. There would appear to be still a general embargo on imports from Russia, co-existent with a regulation subjecting such goods as may be imported in spite of the prohibition to a fourfold duty. In practice, certain Russian goods, e.g., sugar, matches and cement, do find their way into the Hejazi market from Massowah and other ports, but the restrictions, whatever their exact nature, are sufficient to hamper the trade. The Soviet Minister had not33 succeeded in securing their removal when he went on long leave on the 11th October. The fact that he had been continuously resident in Jedda for a very prolonged period might have afforded a sufficient explanation of his depar ture, but His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires gained the impression that his eventual return would depend on the issue of the negotiations which he had initiated. ^ His place was taken by a M. Horace Salkind, who, unlike the Minister, is a non-Moslem, and could not, therefore, go in person to Mecca. This gentleman would not appear to have made much headway during the remainder of the year. He chiefly distinguished himself by his thirst for information about other people’s affairs, and the direct nature of the questions by which he sought to obtain it from his foreign colleagues and commercial residents in Jedda. 84. The Russian steamers trading between the Black Sea and the Persian Gulf continued to call at Jedda at fairly regular intervals during the year. An attempt was made in the early spring to popularise their use by pilgrims from Iraq and Persia. Three sailings were attractively advertised, but the effort was mistimed owing to the decrease in the total volume of the pilgrimage and the action of the Persian Government in practically boycotting it. Few, if any, pilgrims availed themselves of the Russian facilities. (6) Germany. 85. There was little development in the relations between the German and Hejaz-Nejd Governments in 1931, except that the young German merchant, Herr de Haas, who settled in Jedda in 1930, was in due course appointed consul. There was apparently some difficulty in regard to protocol, as his status, unlike that of all other heads of missions representing Governments in normal relations with Ibn Saud, was purely consular. It was apparently decided to recognise him by the issue of an exequatur, probably the first given under the Saudian regime. On the 24th March he notified the other missions of his appointment, which was apparently limited to the Hejaz. In conversation with Sir A. Ryan about that time he foreshadowed the possibility of a career consul being appointed later, perhaps in a year. Herr de Haas was a good deal absent from Jedda for family and business reasons during the remainder of the year. His commercial enterprises seem to have been disappointing. Other German commercial activity in the Hejaz continued on the same lines as those described in paragraph 84 of the annual report for 1930. (7) Poland. 86. There were no signs in 1931 of any development of the relations established with something of a splash in May 1930 between Poland and Hejaz-Nejd. It is more than doubtful whether any further payments were made during the year in respect of the arms, &amp;c., supplied in the summer of that year, for which one-half of the total sum of £80,000 involved was paid at the time of delivery. There was an unconfirmed rumour towards the end of the year that the Hejazi Government were taking steps to recruit new staff for the Hejaz Air Force in Poland, after the breakdown of the negotiations w T ith His Majesty’s Government described in paragraph 165. (8) Sweden. 87. Reference is made in paragraph 150 to the one contact between Sweden and Hejaz-Nejd in 1931, when the Hejazi Government put forward and eventually withdrew a request for the assistance of a Swedish technical mission to prospect for minerals. (9) Denmark. 88. There are no relations between Denmark and Hejaz-Nejd, but mention may be made of a single incident, in which His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom used their good offices on behalf of the Danish Government. This was the disappearance of a foolishly adventurous young Dane, Knud Holmboe, who, having embraced Islam, entered the Hejaz from Transjordan in the neighbourhood of Aqaba, in about October, intending, it appeared, to make his way to the Holy Cities. His Majesty’s Legation in Jedda [7104] ' d34 was unable up to the end of the year to elicit from the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs any information regarding his fate, but there could be little doubt that he had perished in the wild country in the Northern Hejaz. (10) Egypt. 89. The uncertain situation between Egypt and Hejaz-Nejd continued ^ throughout the year. When the Egyptian consul, Hassan Bey-al-Achmouni, returned to Jedda in December 1930, it was supposed that a definite step forward had been made towards an agreement on outstanding questions. A few days later the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs denied that the consul had been instructed to carry on negotiations, but admitted that he was the bearer of a message to Ibn Sand, which was at first supposed to have taken the form of a letter, but proved later to have been merely an oral communication. M. Achmouni was in March superseded, somewhat cavalierly, for reasons which remained obscure; possibly because of accusations of misconduct, including, according to one probably baseless rumour, a suggestion that he had sold himself to Ibn Saud. He was replaced by a certain Hafiz Bey Amer, a perfervid Moslem, with no apparent qualifications for a diplomatic or consular post, except a very poor smattering of English and French. He had been a lawyer and judge in Egypt, and was supposed to be a protege of Emin Yehia Pasha, the Alexandria shipowner and brother to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He maintained a good deal of intercourse with the Hejazi Government, paying several visits to Mecca and Taif, until he went on leave on the 10th September, not to return up to the end of the year. There were no signs of any advance towards an agreement under his auspices. Despite his strong Islamic sentiments, possibly even because of their incompatibility with Wahhabism, he conceived a very adverse opinion of Ibn Saud and his regime. 90. It is possible that the question of the Mahmal, or Sacred Caravan, may have been an even greater stumbling-block in 1931 than previously. Hejazis would welcome its revival as being good for prosperity in the Hejaz; and the Egyptian Prime Minister, speaking in the Egyptian Chamber on the 17th July, expressed the pleasure which it would give his Government to be able to resume the practice of sending the Mahmal with the accompanying gifts and to relieve poverty in Mecca and Medina as in the past. It is noteworthy, however, that in the grand remonstrance addressed to Ibn Saud early in the summer by the Ulema of Nejd, those worthy men expressly commended the King for having discountenanced the system. 91. A passing breeze threatened to disturb the delicate relations between Egypt and Hejaz-Nejd when on the 7th February the “ Aida,” a yacht belonging to the Egyptian Ports and Lights Administration, arrived in'jedda without previous notification to the Hejazi Government, having on board Admiral Tomlin, the British head of the administration. The omission to announce the visit was apparently due to mismanagement in Egypt. The Hejazi Government were violently indignant and directed that a visit which the admiral was to pay to the Governor of Jedda in accordance with arrangements made by the Egyptian consul should not be returned. On hearing of this, His Majesty’s Minister, who had already had occasion to inform Sheikh Yussuf Yasin that the matter ’was of no official concern to any British authority, offered his friendly mediation and succeeded in composing the quarrel after a strenuous Sunday morning’s work. The projected visits were exchanged on the afternoon of the 8th February; Ibn Saud, handsome in a forgiveness which he was glad to be able to ascribe to British intervention, sent presents of meat and fruit aboard the “Aida”; and they all lived happily ever after, so to speak. 92. Notwithstanding the uncertain state of political relations, the Egyptian Government had no reason to complain of the treatment extended to the medical mission which they sent to the Hejaz as usual for the pilgrimage. Happily, there was no repetition of the outrage to Hejazi susceptibilities entailed in 1930 by the action of the Alexandria Quarantine Board in declaring the pilgrims returning by Tor infected. There was a momentary danger of something of the same soil happening in May 1931, but it blew over very quickly. 93. Egyptian financial interests played some little part in connexion with the various schemes for relieving the financial distress of the Hejazi Government.35 [7104] d 2 A representative of the Emir Lutfullah, a rich or once rich Syrian banker of sorts in Egypt, who had dabbled in Hejazi finance in King Hussein’s time, visited Jedda in the spring, ostensibly, or really, to adjust a difficulty over premises rented by his principals. It was rumoured that he brought offers of money, and the Banque Misr was also credited with readiness to accommodate Ibn Saud. ^ Nothing came of these never more than nebulous transactions. (11) Turkey. 94. The Turkish Charg6 d’Affaires, Seni Bey, left Jedda in July to take up a post in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Angora. He was in due course succeeded by one Lutfullah Bey, a younger man with some diplomatic experience in Angora, London and elsewhere. Neither representative showed much sign in 1931 of political activity, beyond keeping in fairly intimate t&lt; th the Russian and perhaps one or two other Legations. There is nothin w that Hejaz-Nejd. (12) Persia. 95. There were equally no signs in 1931 of any development in the relations between Persia and Hejaz-Nejd. The derelict Persian Legation resumed its the beginning of April, but he went on leave again on the 20th June. This time he left his brother-in-law and vice-consul in charge until he came back on the 26th December. Shiite Moslems still suffer from and detest the rigours of Wahhabism. Habibullah Khan frequents everybody and has a passion for taking photographs of his friends by artificial light. His sister and her husband, the vice-consul, were allowed to reside at Taif for some time in the autumn on the distinct understanding that they were there unofficially. There is nothing else to be said about the intercourse between these two Moslem countries during the year. (13) Afghanistan. 96. One of the more notable events of the year was the visit to the Hejaz as a pilgrim of ex-King Amanullah of Afghanistan. He was accompanied by two near relatives of his wife, and his visit was the signal for a gathering of his sympathisers, some of whom arrived in Jedda simultaneously with the King himself on the 18th April. He was received with Royal honours and was entertained by Ibn Saud as his guest. He performed the pilgrimage with great unction, obviously with the object of reinstating himself in the good opinion of Moslems, and showing either that he had always been a good Moslem himself or that, if he had sinned, he was a repentant sinner. His visit passed in an atmosphere of political propaganda on his behalf. It was apparent that, if not definitely preparing for an attempt to regain his throne, he was at least laying a foundation for some such attempt in a not impossible future. He took the opportunity of circulating copies of a long statement, which he had published some little time before, defending his past and attacking Nadir Khan. The Government of India were much perturbed lest Amanullah should endeavour to proceed incognito via one of their ports to Afghanistan. This suspicion was aggravated by the fact that he had grown a beard. This appendage is in the Hejaz an almost necessary proof of piety, but it was thought in India that it might serve the purposes of disguise. In the event the ex-King left Jedda for Italy quite openly on the 9th May, after a short visit to Medina, still wearing his beard, but very anxious to be rid of it. He could hardly have left surreptitiously, even if he had wanted to, without the connivance of Ibn Saud and the Hejazi authorities. There was no reason to suppose that they were in any way associated with his political activities, much less that Ibn Saud, himself so hard pressed for money, was likely to finance a pretender to the Throne of Afghanistan. The King had acted on the principle that he could not deny access to the Holy Places to any Moslem, however embarrassing, and it would have been contrary to his whole attitude not to treat a Royal personage, however decayed, as being entitled to Royal hospitality. Perhaps the greatest honour he did the ex-King was to allow him to participate in the annual sweeping of the Kaaba. the present Turkish Government takes an active interest in irs of. place in the diplomatic life of Jedda on the return of the Charge d’Affaires about36 97. This adventure had no apparent effect on the relations between the present Afghan Government and Hejaz-Nejd. They had been established on a happy basis by the formal recognition of Nadir Khan by Ibn Sand at the beginning of 1930. They had continued to be friendly, though too remote to have much practical effect. A fortnight before Amanullah came to Jedda there had arrived an official delegation from Kabul, which had slipped through India so ^ unostentatiously that its members were taken for ordinary pilgrims. Pilgrimage was, indeed, one of their objects, but they were also charged with the consolida tion of good relations, and possibly, if the Afghan Government had wind of Amanullah’s intentions, with the task of keeping an eye on him. They were hospitably received, and, having accomplished their mission, departed for India on the 7th May. Yet another distinguished personage who made the pilgrimage was the Afghan Minister in Cairo. He, too, may have been sent to watch Amanullah, but his character is such that piety alone would suffice to explain his visit. 98. The events just recorded left little permanent trace. The consolidation of good relations did not make Ibn Saud any more generous towards Afghan pilgrims, many of whom fell into and remained in a state of destitution after the pilgrimage. Early in November the Turkish Charge d’Affaires was put in charge of Afghan interests. This renewed an earlier arrangement which had been made in King Amanullah’s time, but which had lapsed after the accession of Nadir Khan, having been neither cancelled nor confirmed. It is unlikely to prove of much material benefit to Afghans in the Hejaz, but it had the happy effect of killing an idea, which had been ventilated in doubtfully responsible quarters, that the Indian vice-consul might be charged with some sort of Afghan representation. (14) The United States of America. 99. On the 7th May a member of the United States Embassy in London called at the Foreign Office to say that the Ambassador had on the 2nd May formally notified the Hejaz-Nejd Minister of the recognition of Ibn Saud by the United States Government. Earlier in the year the Embassy had intimated privately to the Foreign Office that this step was under consideration in Washington, and had sought and obtained some general information regarding the administration of justice, &amp;e., in Hejaz-Nejd. The recognition caused a mild flutter of satisfaction in Mecca. There is nothing to show what suggested the gesture to the United States Government, who know little about Hejaz-Nejd and have no direct interest in the country, although it is to some extent a market for American products, e.g., the Ford cars and Standard Oil products imported under the auspices of Sharqieh (Limited), Mr. Philby’s firm. It is possible that it may have been a result of the visit to Jedda of Mr. C. R. Crane, a rich American much interested in uplift in the whole East. A gesture it remained, for the United States Government manifested no intention of appointing a diplomatic or consular representative, and are not known to have taken any further action, except when towards the end of the year they invited the Hejaz- Nejd Government to adhere to the Kellogg Pact (see paragraph 109). The activities of the two American experts imported into the Hejaz to prospect for water and minerals are dealt with in the economic section of this report. (c) Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 100. The Hejazi Government have extended their relations with individual Powers. Their attitude towards the general international system is still a mixture of Islamic aloofness, more or less vague mistrust and desire to establish their equal status in the family of nations, whether on general grounds of asserting their independence or to secure specific objects of their own. The last of these three factors tended somewhat to predominate in 1931. It is true that Hejaz-Nejd remains, except in postal matters, almost entirely outside the great system of multilateral treaties in which other Powers are collectively concerned, but this need not be ascribed wholly to aloofness. It is partly due to the fact that the only person in the Hejazi Government who takes an intelligent interest in such matters, Fuad Bey Hamza, suffers from limited knowledge and overwork,[7104] d 3 and is handicapped by his very imperfect knowledge of French. The situation at the end of 1931 may best be gauged by considering two matters of immediate concern to Hejaz-Nejd, viz., international sanitary arrangements and the Arms Traffic Convention, and then, more generally, the position in regard to the League of Nations and certain of its activities. 101. The attitude of the Hejazi Government towards international sanitary arrangements is inspired by an acute inferiority complex. They hate the thought that the Hejaz is branded as a “country of epidemics,” and is the object of special precautions on the part of other Powers. They hate it all the more as they are conscious of, though they will hardly admit, the hopeless inadequacy of their internal sanitary organisation. Their dislike of control was stimulated in 1930 by the action of the Alexandria Quarantine Board in declaring the pilgrimage infected, owing to the discovery of cholera or suspected cholera among returning pilgrims, action which was upheld by the Paris Health Office, though so guardedly that the decision of the office was at one moment claimed to be a vindication of the Hejazi point of view. These considerations, more than any desire for genuine collaboration with other Powers, suggested to them the idea of ratifying the International Sanitary Convention with reservations and inspired an enquiry addressed by Fuad Bey Hamza to Sir A. Ryan in a personal letter of September 1930 as to the possibility of participation in the international arrangements and of securing a seat on the Alexandria Quarantine Board. 102. It was doubtful whether the ratification of the International Convention by the Hejazi Government would be of real advantage, in view of their obvious desire to use participation as a means of escaping from the special position in which the convention places them. On the other hand, there emerged from the proceedings of the International Health Office at Paris in the autumn of 1930 a more useful suggestion, namely, that the British Legation in Jedda should unofficially encourage the Hejazi Government to adhere to the Rome Convention of 1907, and thereby secure permanent representation in the office which it brought into being. On the 5th February, 1931, Sir A. Ryan broached this suggestion to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, with a good deal of explanation. The sheikh knew little about the Rome Convention and his mind was running on the International Convention of 1926, which had become a familiar subject of discussion in Government circles. It was explained to him that the two subjects were separate, and that by acceding to the Rome Convention the Hejazi Govern ment could secure for themselves a solid advantage without prejudice to any views they might hold regarding the convention of 1926. The outcome of the conversation was that Sheikh Yussuf Yasin affirmed definitely the desire of the Hejazi Government to ratify the latter convention if they could make necessary reservations (a point into which Sir A. Ryan promised to enquire), and said that the King would also accede to the Rome Convention. The sheikh did not indicate the nature of the reservations to be made, nor did he on this occasion advert to the wish of his Government to be given a seat on the Alexandria Quarantine Board. 103. His Majesty’s Government were keener on encouraging the Hejazi Government to adhere to the Rome Convention than to ratify the International Sanitary Convention on the lines proposed. They wished to avoid committing themselves in any way as regards the underlying desire of the Hejazis to secure a modification of the special position of the Hejaz under existing arrangements. Ihey foresaw that any question of Hejazi participation in the Alexandria Quarantine Board would be difficult. In general, however, they saw on a balance of considerations advantages in bringing the Hejaz into any useful co-operation with other Powers in international health affairs which might be feasible. The upshot of the whole matter was that on the 13th July, after Fuad Bey Hamza had reverted to the subject, Sir A. Ryan wrote him a letter giving His Majesty’s Government’s views as follows :— (a) The Hejazi Government could attach reservations to their ratification of the International Sanitary Convention only with the previous consent of all States which had signed or adhered to the convention, and should for this purpose communicate the proposed reservations to the French Government for transmission to those States,3S (b) The question of a seat on the Alexandria Quarantine Board was one the decision of which would rest with the Egyptian Government. (c) The Hejazi Government were reminded informally and by way of friendly suggestion of the advantages they might secure by acceding to the Rome Convention of 1907, which could be done by a notification to the Italian Government. 104. In a subsequent conversation on the 15th July Fuad Bey said that before he had received Sir A. Ryan’s letter he had himself reached the conclusion that the best course for his Government would be to adhere, in the first instance, to the Rome Convention. He gave the impression, but did not expressly state, that his idea was to secure a position in the International Health Office, to leave the International Sanitary Convention alone pending its next revision, and to develop the Hejazi sanitary organisation in the meantime. Sir A. Ryan gave him general encouragement, adding a word of warning, however, as to the continued necessity for other countries to protect themselves, within the limits of international arrangements, against the special dangers arising from the dispersal of pilgrims. So far as is known in Jedda, the Hejazi Government took no forward action during the remainder of the year. 105. Fuad Bey Hamza had been somewhat pressing in 1930 regarding the desire of the Hejazi Government to accede to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and had been ill-satisfied with the reply given him that, as the convention had not come into force, no question of accession by non-signatory Powers could yet arise. A re-examination of the matter by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom led to the issue of revised instructions in a despatch to Jedda, dated the 25th March, 1931. It was admitted that, as the Commonwealth of Australia had acceded since His Majesty’s Government expressed their earlier view, it could no longer be urged that there would be insuperable technical difficulties in the way of accession by a non-signatory. It was, however, pointed out that there was little probability of the convention coming into force in the near future, or, indeed, of its coming into force at all without amendment. A Hejazi accession at the time of writing would therefore be in the nature of a meaningless gesture. On the other hand, the hoped-for conclusion of a general disarmament convention as a result of the conference projected for February 1932 might hasten the entry into force of the Arms Traffic Convention. The despatch went on to speak of the evident desire of the Hejazi Government to use accession to the convention as a means of securing the removal of Hejaz-Nejd from the category of “special zones,” and of the conditions with which the Hejazi Government would have to comply for that purpose. Mr. Henderson apprehended that they would have considerable difficulty in carrying out the obligations imposed by the convention, and thought it undesirable that they should undertake them by acceding to it. 106. Sir A. Ryan was given discretion to explain the above considerations to the Hejazi Government if they should revert to the matter, stressing the onerous nature of the obligations which would be entailed if they acceded to the convention, and leaving them to take their own decision. It was not until the 8th July that Fuad Bey again broached the subject in conversation, whereupon Sir A. Ryan sent him a letter, dated the 13th July, embodying in a suitable form the main points in the Foreign Office despatch. Nothing further passed during the remainder of the year. Fuad Bey’s interest had to some extent been diverted to the question of the position of Hejaz-Nejd in regard to the Disarmament Conference, a subject which he also mentioned on the 8th July. Before dealing with it, it will be well to consider the general position of Ibn Baud’s Government vis-a-vis the League of Nations. 107. The position of Hejaz-Nejd as regards possible membership of the League had been discussed tentatively both in Jedda and in London in 1930, in the circumstances described in paragraph 102 ff of the annual report for that year. On the 8th April, 1931, Mr. Henderson addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda a considered despatch dealing with the various points which had arisen. It began with a statement of various arguments in favour of Hejaz-Nejd becoming a member of the League, such as the value it might have in bringing the Hejazi Government into co-operation with other countries in various matters of[7104] d 4 39 Its international concern, especially (though subject to some doubt as to the advisability from a British point of view of stressing the international aspects of the Arabian air route and the sanitary control of the pilgrimage), in connexion with communications, more particularly aerial communications, and health ^ control; and still more its advantages in connexion with the eventual relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Iraq. Mr. Henderson went on to express some doubt, on the other hand, as to whether the League itself would be strengthened by the admission of a country so primitive. He dwelt, in this connexion, on the difficulty created by Ibn Saud’s attitude as regards slavery, which might cause other Powers to object, and thereby place His Majesty's Government in an invidious position were they too active in encouraging the King to seek membership. He glanced next at the awkwardness which might result from the requirement of the League that an applicant State must possess established frontiers, having regard to the uncertainty of the frontier between Asir and the Yemen, and the provisional character of that between the Hejaz and Transjordan, matters the discussion of which at Geneva would be inconvenient. The despatch then dealt at length with the legal questions arising out of the inclusion of the Hejaz, then a separate country under King Hussein, in the list of original members of the League referred to in article 1 of the Covenant and its subsequent incorporation in Ibn Saud’s dominions. The general conclusion reached on a balance of arguments was that the nature of the union between the Hejaz and Nejd was so much in the nature of a “ real ’ ’ union, that both must be held to have disappeared as separate international units, and to have been replaced by a new single State. It was deduced that, while the effects of such a union would not involve an extinction of all the international obligations of the component States, it would no longer be open to the Hejaz to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, or to become separately a member of the League; and that the only possible procedure would be for the new joint state of Hejaz-Nejd to apply for election as a member. Sir A. Ryan was authorised to convey His Majesty’s Government’s views on the legal situation to the Hejazi authorities, if they again approached him, and to discuss the matter generally in the light of the considerations set forth in the despatch; but he was informed in a concluding paragraph that they were all subject to the general principle that His Majesty’s Government desired to see membership of the League as universal as possible. “ They cannot, consistently with this principle,” said Mr. Henderson, “do anything to dissuade a State which is now outside the League, but wishes to come in, from applying for membership. If, therefore, the Hejazi Government express such a wish, you should say that His Majesty’s Government welcome their decision and will support their candidature at Geneva.” 108. On the 8th July, Fuad Bey reverted to the subject in conversation with His Majesty’s Minister. He seemed anxious to obtain a written statement of the conclusions which His Majesty’s Government had formed from their study of the question as broached in 1930. Sir A. Ryan was unwilling to give him one, in view of the delicacy of many of the matters discussed in the Foreign Office despatch, but, on the 15th July, he made an oral statement based principally on the portion of it dealing with the legal situation, which Fuad Bey admitted to be indeterminate so far as the relations between the Hejaz and Nejd were concerned The Minister refrained from any reference to the possibility that the question of frontiers might give rise to difficulty; nor did he revert to the question of slavery, as Fuad Bey had been acquainted with the views of His Majesty’s Government on that subject in other conversations. He asked Fuad Bey in the course of the conversation whether his Government had made up their minds to seek admission to the League, and, having been told that they were merely looking into the matter, he withheld the statement contemplated in the passage quoted at the end of the preceding paragraph. The Hejazi Government did not pursue the matter further with the Legation up to the end of the year. 109. The two preceding paragraphs give a sufficiently accurate general view of what passed in 1931. It is, however, so condensed that anyone specially interested in the matter would do well to peruse the actual correspondence, especially the full text of Mr. Henderson’s despatch. The exchange of views with His Majesty’s Government may have slightly influenced, but did not determine the action of the Hejazi Government in connexion with certain40 particular activities of the League. They accepted early in the year an invitation to attend the Conference for the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs, which sat at Geneva from the 27th May to the 13th July, 1931, and their delegate, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, signed the resultant convention andi final act. This first participation of theirs, even as a non-member, in the work of the League was a hopeful sign, but it is perhaps not too cynical to suggest that the occasion was chosen as one on which the Hejazi Government could appear in the limelight as a civilised State interested in a matter of world concern without the risk of commitments likely to embarrass them in any way. Later in the year, Fuad Bey linked with the discussion already recorded of the Arms Traffic Convention, a more important subject, that of the omission of Hejaz-Nejd from the list of Powers invited to the Disarmament Conference to be held in February 1932, and in due course the Hejazi Minister in London approached the Foreign Office on the same subject. He was referred to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and worked so successfully, that in September the League invited his Government both to attend the conference and to adhere to the one-year armament truce proposed as a preliminary to it. About the same time, or shortly after, the United States Government invited them to accede to the Kellogg Paet. This success gave great pleasure in Mecca, and afforded the inspired “ Umm-al-Qura ” an opportunity of proclaiming the devotion of Ibn Saud to the cause of peace, while, at the same time, commenting with patronising pity on the mess that the Western Powers had got themselves into. The Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs proceeded to deal with the invitations with leisurely dignity. They agreed, on the 23rd November, to the armaments truce, subject to a reservation, similar to that made by certain other Powers at Geneva, regarding their right, without prejudice to the principle of the truce, to adopt “such measures as the normal carrying out of legal enactments relating to effectives, the regular execution of programmes for the upkeep and renewal of land, naval and air material or fortifications, and the constitution of the corresponding stocks.” They were still considering at the end of the year their attitude regarding the Disarmament Conference and the Kellogg Pact. As regards the former,' Fuad Bey confessed privately to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, on the 31st October, how difficult it would be for his Government to make a return of their armed forces, and he admitted that his own comparative ignorance of French hampered his study of the documents which he had received. It may, however, be stated, in anticipation of the report for 1932, that the Hejazi Minister in London was in due course appointed to represent Ibn Saud at the conference. 110. In the course of the summer the Hejazi Government received at least two invitations to international gatherings of a minor character : one from the Netherlands Government to attend an International Conference of Orientalists in Leyden; one from His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to send delegates to the Fifth International Conference of Local Authorities in London in 1932. They were unable to find anyone learned and rich enough to represent them at Leyden. They had not replied to the other invitation up to the end of the year. 111. The progress towards the larger life recorded in the preceding paragraphs does not amount to much. It would be a mistake either to exaggerate or to underestimate its value for the future. At present Hejaz-Nejd is too much on the defensive to approach international questions which really concern her in a spirit of true desire to co-operate with the Powers; too isolated and undeveloped to appear other than ridiculous in toying with international questions outside her range. On the other hand, if she is destined to survive, it is all to the good that a fairly promising younger statesman like Fuad Bey Hamza should feel the urge of the winds that are blowing the nations back to Eden; that Ibn Saud should not be so fanatical as to discourage him; and that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, the most sensible of the King’s tiny band of experts in foreign affairs, should be getting some practical experience of the working of international machinery. * (d) Treaties. 112. An attempt was made in Appendix I to the annual report for 1930 to give a list of agreements concluded between Ibn Saud and other Powers, which41 &lt; ’ was stated to be not necessarily complete. In the autumn of 1931 the Ilejazi Government produced a printed collection of treaties, which did great credit to its compiler, Fuad Bey Hamza, but was also incomplete and occasionally inaccurate in minor respects. Appendix I to the present report gives a revised list derived from these two and certain other sources. The unusual circumstances in which the report has been compiled have made it impossible to ensure absolute completeness and accuracy at all points, but the list as now presented may be taken to contain everything having any important bearing on the international situation of Hejaz-Nejd at the end of 1931. HI.— Internal Affairs. (1) General Situation. 113. Although the internal situation in Hejaz-Nejd suffered an undoubted deterioration in 1931, there was no resistance to Ibn Baud’s authority (except perhaps in Asir, which has already been dealt with) of such importance as 1° become publicly known. There were, indeed, not infrequent rumours of trouble in Nejd ”; reports in January of disaffection among the Ajman tribe and a little later of alleged restiveness on the part of Ibn Musaad, the Governor of Hail, who is related to the King; constant but ill-informed anxiety regarding the situation in the country towards the Transjordan frontier; tales of the escape irom Hai of members of the Rashid family and of the prospect of a Shammar revolt, and so forth. Most of these reports may be dismissed as unsubstantiated gossip, indicative at most of a certain malaise, not so much in the country as a whole as in places like Mecca and Jedda, which serve as sounding-boards for rumour. There is no serious evidence that the King has lost his grip on Nejd He had to make some show of concession to the extremist views of the uleina there, as will be seen presently. He may be unable to count on the continued loyalty of t e Shammar or the tribes which revolted in 1929, but he probably keeps a tight ho d on the remnants of the Rashid family and other possible leaders of rebellion The best known of the latter, Feisal-ad-Dawish, died at Riadh in October o November, almost certainly from natural causes, helped perhaps by lo g confinement. 114 The evolution of the situation in the Hejaz may best be indicated by relating' summarily a sequence of particular events. The anniversary of the K ng’s accession was celebrated at Mecca and Jedda on the 8th and 9th January, with the same pomp as in the previous year, a fact which at the time seemed to indicate that Ibn S p aud was strong enough to defy extreme religious opmion m Neid but which had a later repercussion m a contrary sense The King hi returned from Riadh to Mecca on the 20th January. On the. second day of the Bayram Festival in February he created a sensation by not only allowuigMs Neidi soldiers to execute a war dance, but himself joining n . 7 later on the 25th February, he came to Jedda, timing his visit so as to meet t c rieh old American Mr C. R. Crane, who has taken a lifelong interest sometimes tinned wit^Te^olutionary sympathies, in the affairs of the East, and had on this tinged witnrevouLioiiay^F ^ Atlantic to make the acquaintance of Thn a W° The latter showered attentions on his visitor, possibly hoping (though if the hope were entertained it was unfulfilled) for revivifying dollars from the it w e ie e organised a great review, the principal feature o thi'ch^ a^ioter Nejdl dance,'ll! which tie Princes took part as in teature oi w himself. This stimulated various sections of the Mecca, u t j^ a to s how what they themselves could do in the dancing line. For U ^veral°da\^ gatherings Mkiyal ^subjects went in procession through the greets To dance lutside thf King's’ palace. Jedda presented almost the joyous aspect of a city in the primrose stage of revolution. iik Tinnfi mr was called off after about a week. Some political firsfday of the festival. The Nejdis had then expressed a wish to show then42 skill, and the King, caught in a genial mood, had consented. This version is discounted by the fact that a dance of the same kind had been included several weeks before in the programme of the accession celebrations. It is natural to suppose that the revival of the old custom was a deliberate attempt to conciliate Nejdis and Hejazis alike by a breakaway from the rigid puritanism of the extreme Wahhabis. 116. Graver matters were impending. The financial situation was becoming more and more acute in circumstances which are described elsewhere. It was the indirect cause of an incident in March, which, though isolated, was symptomatic of restless tendencies. A number of chauffeurs, discontented at not receiving heavy arrears of wages due by the Government or associated companies, organised a sort of strike in Mecca. Headed by a Syrian, they attempted to bring their grievances to the notice of the higher authorities, and apparently indulged in some molestation of other chauffeurs or users of certain cars, or both. The facts were obscure, but the demonstration culminated in a party of the recalcitrant chauffeurs being set upon by the King’s men, apparently under his personal orders, and being thrown into prison after being first mercilessly beaten. The sequel to this affair falls to be dealt with in another section of this report. It is mentioned here as an instance of a disturbance of the peace in Mecca which produced a good deal of temporary emotion. 117. The failure of the pilgrimage and its effect on the economic and financial situation opened the eyes of the King and his advisers to the need for measures to cope with the ever-increasing difficulties in the Hejaz. Arab townsmen are not the people for riot or revolt, but there was much latent feeling in places like Mecca and Jedda. The merchants were suffering from acute depression. There was a tendency to criticise the extravagance of the Court, the demands for money for Nejdi purposes, and the drain involved in the importa tion from abroad of motor vehicles. This last cause of discontent had its counterpart in the depression of those interested in camel transport, the camel- owners, and, a more articulate class, because they are townsmen, the carpenters engaged in the manufacture of camel litters. All this provided the setting for a decision taken by the King towards the end of May to convoke a “ National Conference ” of urban representatives, which was to be held annually, and was called upon on this first occasion to advise on a large range of current affairs. His Majesty, it was explained, was in personal touch with his Bedouin subjects. He now wished, in accordance with the best Islamic traditions of consultation with wise and thoughtful men, to enable the people of the town to give expression to their views. 118. The electoral arrangements for the conference was not clearly defined in any public document. Elections of a kind were, however, held to select repre sentatives from among the notables of the various Hejazi towns ajid separate representatives of the ulema. The conference, attended by these and various official personages, was opened at Mina on the 2nd June, and sat afterwards in Mecca until the 11th June. Certain parliamentary forms were observed. The King made a speech and the conference produced a loyal address. Three committees were constituted to deal with the appropriate sections of the agenda prepared by the Government: public morals and pilgrimage matters, judicial matters, and economic and general affairs. A report subsequently published described the subjects dealt with under those heads and gave some idea, though a very imperfect one, of the conclusions arrived at. The committee on public morals, &amp;c., dealt with the means of promoting Islamic morality and the regula tion of the pilgrimage, with special reference to the complaints made against mutawwifs and their agents. The committee on judicial affairs considered two main subjects, the general functioning of the courts and the expeditious disposal of pending cases. The third committee was the largest and the most immediately important, for its agenda comprised a wide range of economic and financial questions. 119. The conference made, according to the published report, many recommendations. As its functions were merely advisory, these were naturall'v reserved for consideration by the appropriate authorities, religious and other. Finance was the most crucial subject considered, and some of the delegates werebold enough to speak their minds as to the character of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman’s Administration and the necessity for a budget. This angered the King, who was reported to have used language that might be summed up in the words, “ le budget, c’est moi! ” According to some, the attitude of the bolder spirits on this question decided His Majesty to bring the proceedings to a premature close. For the rest, the conference produced so little in the way of concrete results during the remainder of the year that it is unnecessary to enlarge much further on its activities. It is worth noting, however, that it advocated a reform whereby the mutawwifs should cease to be intermediaries for the collection of taxes on pilgrims; suggested that all cases pending in the courts should be submitted to a review by four named ulema; approved the idea that Hejazi currency should be brought into use throughout Ibn Baud’s dominions and that the Maria Theresa dollar should be gradually eliminated; and favoured the promotion of economic development by means of foreign experts and concessions, but subject to the reservation that the experts and concessionnaires should be Moslems. 120. The King was now preparing to depart for Riadh. Before he left on the 28th June he took two steps which were, perhaps, intended more to conciliate religious opinion in Nejd than to inaugurate a new policy in the Hejaz. He allowed to be published in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” a letter addressed to him by the ulema of Nejd on the impropriety from an Islamic point of view of repeated annual celebrations to commemorate his accession, together with his own reply. The remonstrance of the ulema was deferential but perfectly firm. The King expressed his delight at receiving their counsel, accepted their view unreservedly and asked pardon of God for his offence. At the same time steps were taken to revive in a slightly modified form arrangements, which had for some time lapsed almost completely, to combat vicious practices like abstention from prayer, the public use or sale of tobacco (an article which the Wahhabis reprehend, although its importation is tolerated), and the use of gramophones, &amp;c. 121. Despite the impoverishment of the Treasury, the King’s progress to Riadh was effected with all the customary parade. Most of his relatives and his household accompanied him, and the vehicles used ran to many hundreds. He was said to have taken with him large quantities of Hejazi silver money for use in Nejd, intending, it was suggested, to pay his subsidies in that coin as one means of extending its use. To some his departure presented the appearance of a flight from the Hejaz. There could be no ground for such a suggestion. He had been absent from Nejd almost without interruption for over a year and could not neglect it indefinitely. Nevertheless, his year in the Hejaz had been a year of failure to cope with problems too complicated for him. He left it in a mess and without any strong or coherent administration, once he himself was not on the spot. The Amir Feisal, the Viceroy, has little apparent capacity for affairs. With him were left Fuad Bey Hamza, a man of ideas and industry, but no compelling influence, the deplorable Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman and others less known, the principal of whom would appear to be Abdullah-al-Fadhl, Vice- President of the Legislative Council. For nearly three months the Hejaz drifted aimlessly. If anyone dominated the local stage it was Abdullah Suleiman, pursuing a policy of extortion which culminated in the flagrant robbery of the benzine”belonging to the Egyptian Shell and Standard Oil companies in September (see paragraphs 213 and 214). Fuad Hamza found himself relegated to a siding, while things went more and more wrong. The benzine affair helped to precipitate a crisis. On the 17th September, the Amir and Fuad Bey came to Jedda to investigate that and certain other matters, including the air force situation and the complaints of the Nejdi soldiers, who were unpaid and restless. At this juncture Mr. Philby came upon the scene and for once played an important role. For some months he had been growing disillusioned with his adopted country and even with Ibn Saud. The theft of the Standard Oil benzine caused him to boil over with indignation against Abdullah Suleiman when he, Mr. Philby, arrived from Riadh at the end of September. It was apparently due to his intervention that the Viceroy, Fuad Bey and the Al-Fadhls combined in an attempt to overthrow the Director-General of Finance. Abdullah-al-Fadhl took to Riadh on the 23rd October a report to the King in which they threatened resignation unless Abdullah Suleiman were removed. Thither went also Abdullah Suleiman himself.mmimr'*'- 44 122. The effects of this demonstration, in so far as they bore on the financial situation, are related in the financial section of this report. When Sheikh Yussuf Yasin brought the King’s orders to Jedda on the 12th November, he announced also measures of constitutional reform. The latter, so His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was informed, were not yet elaborated, but His Majesty had ^ accepted the principle of a Council of Ministers with joint responsibility. The decree providing for this was not published until the middle of January 1932. As it is in any case too soon to judge of the value of the constitutional any more than of the financial reform, it need not be analysed in detail here. It will suffice to say that it falls to be regarded as an amendment of the Hejazi Constitution of 1926 and as applying only to the Hejaz, although this is not clearly stated; that it clearly affirms the joint responsibility of a small council under the presidency of the Amir Feisal, who is still to be Viceroy when the King is absent from the Hejaz, but to be merely President of the Council at other times; that it creates a Ministry of the Interior with several subordinate departments; and that for the time being the Amir is to be head of that Ministry as well as of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 123. It has been possible to give a coherent description of the sequence of events in Mecca and Jedda. No equally clear account can be given of the situation in the interior of the Hejaz. In certain areas, notably that of which Medina is the centre, the tribes would appear to have been reduced to a state of misery bordering on starvation, but there was no indication of revolt. Those towards the Transjordan frontier were probably less unfortunate, for it is necessary to keep them more or less contented, while at the same time maintaining some measure of discipline among them. The way in which a balance is maintained between these opposing considerations was illustrated in 1931 in the case of the important Beni Atiya, who frequent both sides of the frontier. The bulk of this tribe were collected in the Hejaz during the latter part of the year. At first they were allowed considerable license. They raided other Hejazi tribes and were treated with such toleration that Captain Glubb described them in the autumn as Ibn Saud’s “ blue-eyed boys.” It is, nevertheless, probable that the reorganisation of the frontier administration, early in the year, was partly designed to provide the means of controlling disorderly elements. It was suggested later that the Shammar and other tribesmen were being mobilised for a punitive expedition to overawe the Beni Atiya, Be this as it may, they had apparently lost the King’s favour by the end of the year. (2) A dministration. 124. This subject is touched on in so many connexions elsewhere in this report that little need be said of it in a separate section. From a foreign point of view the most salient features of Ibn Saud’s system still are the complete centralisation of all real authority in the hands of the King, whose advisers and officials enjoy some latitude in minor matters, but must refer all important questions for his personal decision; and the continued inadequacy of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It will be remembered that a reorganisation of this depart ment was projected in December 1930. It was hoped that a permanent branch of the Ministry would be established at Jedda, and that Fuad Bey Hamza, who had been made Under-Secretary with the Amir Feisal in titular charge of the Ministry, would spend much of his time there. Steps were taken at and about the same time to collect a small number of young men capable of serving as secretaries. All this broke down completely. Fuad Bey’s illness and his subsequent absence on leave until the middle of April deprived the Ministry of its one energetic element. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, who replaced him and who, in fact, devoted much time to foreign business in Jedda during that period, was more the King’s man than a departmental official. After his visit to Jedda at the end of January and beginning of February, the Amir Feisal manifested no overt interest in foreign affairs and confined himself to signing documents. Fuad Bey, when he returned reverted to his previous system of spending most of his time at Mecca or Taif and visiting Jedda for short periods at irregular intervals. It would probably not suit him to risk the waning of his influence by absenting himself too much from the Centre, and he is too jealous of his position to leave much to subordinates. The small collection of bright young men tended to disintegrate as the year wore on. At the end of December Fuad Bey and ayoung brother of his, who feebly seconds him, appeared to be almost the only persons in the Ministry available for more than mechanical tasks. 125. The mismanagement by Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman of that other one-man show, the Directorate-General of Finance, is illustrated by many passages in this report. It is only necessary to make it clear here that, although 4| he was sent on a mission to Hasa after the crisis which came to a head in November, he was not definitely removed from his post. He, too, has a brother, who appeared to be in charge of the department at the end of the year and to be keeping Sheikh Abdullah’s place warm for him in the most fraternal spirit Indeed, the Directorate-General appeared to be again somewhat of an imyerium in im'perio, judging by the distinction which Fuad Bey attempted to make in January 1932 between it and “the Government.” 126. Little can be said of how the other Departments of State function in Mecca. They are doubtless organised and staffed, but it will be soon enough to speak of them when it is possible to appraise the results of the reforms instituted towards the end of the year. 127. There is no change to record in the system of provincial administra tion. In Jedda, the only place which can be observed at close quarters, the tendency during 1931 was to curtail the power of the rich and respectable merchant who has been Governor for many years. A Hejazi, of Persian origin, he has little love for the present regime, and, though frequently consulted at critical times, he withdrew more and more from the direction of local affairs, leaving it to his assistants to take orders from Mecca. Administrative changes in the neighbourhood of the Transjordan frontier attracted attention in British quarters. Two Sadairis, members of a Nejdi family connected with the King, were installed in the important Governorates of Jauf and Tebuk. The removal of En Neshmi from the former of these posts and the appointment of Sheikh Abdul Aziz-bin-Zeid as Inspector of Bedouin in the whole area are adverted to in the section of this report dealing with Transjordan. The former Governor of Qaf, the post closest to the frontier, was replaced by a person of no great con sideration, but more energetic and less conciliatory than his predecessor. Towards the end of the year the headquarters of what had been the Govern orate of Jauf were transferred to Skaka. IV. —Financial, Economic and Commercial Affairs. 128. The financial situation of the Hejaz-Nejd was extremely precarious at the end of 1930. In 1931 it became well-nigh desperate. The falling off of the overseas pilgrimage from over 80,000 in 1930 to some 40,000 in 1931 was disastrous in its effect not only on the revenue derived from the direct taxation of pilgrims, but on that accruing from the trade to which the annual influx of foreigners bringing money into the country and having to be catered for gives rise. Merchants had neither the inducement nor the means to engage in large transactions. In some cases they were burdened with stocks carried over from the previous year, or even longer. The customs receipts, the principal item in the Hejazi revenue, are stated in a fairly well-informed quarter to have been nearly £1,200,000 in the lunar year ending the 8th June, 1929, and to have dwindled to less than £900,000 for the year ending about the 18th May, 1931. It is doubtful whether they could be expected to yield more than something in the region of £500,000 in the year ending in May 1932. 129. The Government had great difficulty in financing payments early in the year. It was only by exerting the utmost pressure that His Majesty’s Minister obtained payment in March of the long-overdue cable account of the Eastern Telegraph Company up to December 1930. When about the same time Sir A. Ryan reopened the question of the Government of India’s claim for about £31,500 for arms and ammunition supplied in an emergency in 1929, for which that Government had consented to wait until not later than the 28th February, 1931, the King sent a message asking for another year’s delay. He was ashamed, he said, to make a further appeal for consideration, but if he were to discharge the debt he would have to borrow elsewhere, and he would rather owe money to friends than to strangers. Salaries fell more and more into arrear. The failure40 of the Government to pay sums overdue to its chauffeurs caused an incident which is described elsewhere. 130. The leanness of the public purse was fully revealed after the pilgrims had come and mostly gone. When the King decided to convene the National Conference in June (see paragraph 117) finance was one of the principal items on the agenda. The King’s reaction to criticism of existing methods has already been described infra. 119. Desperate efforts were made to enlist foreign assistance at that time and later. In his June conversations with Sir A. Ryan the King asked for assistance to bring a British bank to the Hejaz. Hopes were also entertained of obtaining accommodation from the Netherlands Trading Company. Abdurrahman Qusaibi was sent on a wind-raising tour in Europe. In July the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London approached the Foreign Office on the subject of a British bank, and in August he made strong personal appeals in London to the head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, then in England on leave. He drew a terrible picture of the state of things in the Hejaz. Recognising that there was urgent need of reform in Ibn Saud’s administration, he begged to be put in a position to hold out to the King a prospect of British financial help in some shape or form if he adopted reforms which he, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba, thought of submitting to him personally. 131. All these attempts to get European assistance broke down. His Majesty’s Government were sympathetic but entirely non-committal, except that the Department of Overseas Trade gave some advice and an introduction to Barclay’s Bank, besides complying with a request of the Hejazi Minister that the Ottoman Bank, with which Qusaibi was in touch, should be informed that His Majesty’s Government were cognisant of what was toward. Qusaibi himself had no success anywhere. Business might have been done with the Netherlands Trading Company on the basis of a loan secured on customs had Ibn Saud been readier to accept some effective control in that department and the Dutch more confident of the stability of his regime. Nothing was heard in the latter part of the year of offers said to have been made in the spring by Egyptian financial interests. 132. Meanwhile the situation in the Hejaz was going from bad to worse. The King had gone to Riadh in July, leaving the Holy Land to stew in its own tiresome juice. It was said in his praise that he was himself giving an example of retrenchment. There is some evidence that he subsequently economised at Riadh, but, as has already been stated, the journey thither involved the usual expensive parade. He had left behind his Director-General of Finance. The latter had done his best to fill the till locally by extracting loans from merchants under compulsion. He reached the nadir of unscrupulosity when he stole in September the stocks of benzine belonging to Egyptian Shell and the Standard Oil Company in the Government stores at Jedda, the most scandalous breach of trust by the Government in the recent history of the Hejaz (see paragraphs 213 and 214). 133. Matters came to a head in October in the manner described in paragraph 121. The King’s first reaction to the memorandum submitted by the cabal formed to undo Abdullah Suleiman was to order the closing of the Hejazi Treasury and the suspension of all payments. Some days later he despatched Sheikh Yussuf Yasin post haste to the Hejaz with a Royal proclamation, announcing budgetary reform. It did not, indeed, provide for a public budget, but it established the principle that the revenue was to be allocated to four purposes, viz., current administration, clearance of the floating debt, reserve, and extraordinary expenditure on betterment schemes, such as improved pilgrimage conditions and economic development. His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires was orally informed of the new arrangements, and was told that the revenue, the estimated amount of which was not stated, was to be assigned to the above four headings in the proportion of 35, 25, 15 and 25 per cent. Other reforms were announced, including the constitutional change already described. The Director-General of Finance was not dismissed, but he was sent provisionally to strengthen the committee under Muhammad-al-Tawil. which was already employed in reorganising the administration of the Hasa Coast. A new post of47 Treasurer-General was created, and was given to one of the A1 Fadhls, a family discredited by the embroilment of their affairs described in paragraph 215. 134. Except for the temporary occultation of Abdullah Suleiman, the reforms had produced no palpable result up to the end of the year. The Government continued to live from hand to mouth, salaries remained in arrear, and it was generally felt that the remedy had been devised too late, even if Ibn Saud had men capable of administering it. It detracted from the attractiveness of the reform that the allocation of 25 per cent, of the revenue to the payment of old debts in fact implied a drastic moratorium without any certainty of eventual settlement. It was proposed to treat all creditors on a footing of equality, and to pay them in instalments as and when resources permitted, a process which, according to Fuad Bey's forecast, would take about two years. The hardship on creditors, if this plan should be strictly adhered to, promised to be all the greater, as it was later announced that the new budget would run from the ist of Shaban, i.e., the 12th December, 1931. When explaining the reform to Mr. Hope Gill, on the 13th November, Fuad Bey and Sheikh Yussuf Yasin conveyed an express request that His Majesty’s Government should allow the debt to the Government of India to be treated in the same way as other debts. The position was less clear in regard to certain other claims in which His Majesty’s Government had an interest. An older promise to keep telegraphic receipts in a special account to ensure punctual settlement with the Eastern Telegraph Company was renewed, but the two announcers confined themselves to taking note of Mr. Hope Gill’s view that the agreement regarding payment for the stolen benzine belonging to Egyptian Shell should be strictlv observed. The Government were understood to be negotiating direct with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., for a deferred settlement of other indebtedness to them. At the end of the year that firm was still working on the basis of paying half the duty on new imports in cash, and settling the other half off against monies due to them by the Government. 135. Another project formed in the latter part of the year was that of engaging an European financial adviser. The post was at one moment offered to the Jedda manager of the Dutch Bank. This proposal fell through, and at the end of the year negotiations were pending for the employment of another Dutchman. 136. Among the expedients resorted to during the year to increase revenue was a considerable increase in customs duty early in the year, and a further increase affecting a limited range of important commodities in November. Heavy calls in the nature of forced loans in money or kind were made in the towns. Certain tribes were also tapped. A levy of 10 riyals a head for alleged war purposes was said to have produced 400,000 riyals in the Taif region alone. 137. The financial decline in 1931 was accompanied by a series of exchange crises. Under regulations promulgated on the 3rd January, 1928, the monetary system of the country is based on the English gold pound, a coin of which there has normally been a plentiful supply. The new Saudi riyal, a silver coin similar in weight and content to the old Turkish mejidie, was given a fixed value at the parity of 10 to the £ gold. It was of unlimited legal tender, but the parity was safeguarded in principle by a stipulation that the Finance Department would at any time exchange gold for silver or vice versa at the legal rate. The pound and the riyal were respectively sub-divided into 110 and 11 piastres miri, a theoretical unit used in accountancy, but not represented by any actual coin; and for practical purposes into nickel “ Saudi ” piastres and smaller fractions, with an exchange value of 220 Saudi piastres to the pound. The name halala, which applies properly to the quarter piastre Saudi, is also used more generally to describe the nickel coinage as a whole. 138. In February, owing to unsettled political and economic conditions, the riyal broke away from gold sufficiently to alarm the market and the Government. The latter attempted to restore the situation. They reasserted by proclamation the legal parity. They made an arrangement with the Dutch Bank to accept riyals^at 10, plus a very small surcharge and the bank’s commission, in payment for foreign exchange. They prohibited the export of gold, These measures were temporarily successful, but broke down some weeks later. The riyal again48 weakened in April. The prohibition on the export of gold was tacitly revoked about that time. The arrangement which had been made with the Dutch Bank had ceased to work, apparently because the gold which the Government had earmarked for the repurchase of riyals from the bank was insufficient, and because the Government threw riyals back on to the market. An attempt to come to a new arrangement with the bank with a larger gold backing of £60,000 was v unsuccessful. 139. Round about pilgrimage day, the 28th April, the centre of interest shifted to halalas, which fell to panic rates. The Government took vacillating measures, the upshot of which was a scheme to take large quantities off the market by a sort of forced loan levied on Moslem merchants. The Government were to put up £8,000 worth, the merchants £16,000, on the understanding that repayment w'ould be made at some future date. The shops of the money-changers, who were accused of having exploited the crisis, were mercilessly closed. These devices restored the parity between nickel and silver, but silver itself continued to go slowly west. In the course of the summer the riyal sank to about 17. 140. When Great Britain went off the gold standard in September, a more or less chaotic period ensued in the Hejaz. The market, an isolated one, was slow to adapt itself to new conditions. The Government were incapable of devising a monetary policy in circumstances so extraordinary. Their only definite measure was to reprohibit the export of gold in October, except by permission, to be granted, it was understood, on a guarantee to import equivalent goods within three months. The evolution can best be shown by describing the situation in December, when things had to some extent settled down. Gold had been disappearing in considerable quantities from the market, as a result of buying the Dutch Bank bought in a good deal for its own purposes), hoarding and possibly remittances to Riadh to build up a reserve there for the King’s purposes. Other currencies, like sterling and Egyptian, had come into increased use. The riyal had become little more than a token coin, for the Government, while still trying to pay it out at ten to the £ where they were in a position to enforce its acceptance, e.g., by persons drawing official salaries, would no longer accept it in important receiving departments, e.g., the Customs. Their ideas about trans actions in foreign currencies were illogical but convenient. They seemed to think that they could discharge obligations in pounds, even if payable in gold, by presenting sterling cheques. On the other hand, they required payment at gold rate of certain payments to themselves stated in Egyptian currency. 141. were :— The approximate rates ruling in Jedda at the end of December £ gold £ sterling £ Egyptian 19 rupees = 17^ riyals. = 12^ riyals. = 13 riyals. = 1 £ gold. 142. To complete the foregoing account it is necessary to hark back to the early summer. The Government had then conceived the idea of rehabilitating the riyal by extending its use to parts of Ibn Saud’s dominions other than the Hejaz, that is to say, to Nejd and Asir, where the principal currency had continued to be Maria Theresa dollars. The National Conference approved of this plan in principle, but added the rider that the elimination of the Maria Theresa dollar should be gradual. On the 19th June the Government issued a communique explaining the reasons for postponing any decision to enforce the exclusive use of Hejazi currency, but providing, subject to reservations, that all commercial transactions should be based on Saudi piastres and fixing authorised rates for other currencies as follows :— P. Saudi. Riyal ... ... ... ... =22 £ sterling ... ... ... ... = 220 £ Turkish ... ... ... ... = 190 M.T. dollar = 11 Indian rupee ... ... ... = 13 143. This regulation was ineffective in the Hejaz, but steps were taken to get the riyal going in Nejd. It was said that the King intended to distribute his[7104] e 49 largesse to the tribes in that currency. A plan was devised to retail goods bought (or borrowed) in the Hejaz by means of a network of stalls at which all transactions were to be in riyals. This latter scheme broke down, but in one way or another riyals were put into circulation. They proved extremely unpopular, partly because merchants complained that they were of no use in Koweit and Bahrein. Riyals passed at a much lower gold value than in the Hejaz, although information as to the actual rates is conflicting. 144. The general economic situation in the Hejaz was extremely depressed throughout the year. * The townsmen suffered the direct consequences of a diminished pilgrimage, and carried on apathetically, enduring as best they might the leanness of the land, the atmosphere of political uncertainty with its rumours of trouble in the interior or on the Transjordan and Yemen frontiers and the exactions of the Government. By the end of the year it was certain that the 1932 pilgrimage offered no prospect of relief. Precise information is never obtainable regarding the situation among the tribes, but it is certain that those in the interior of the Northern Hejaz have had a very thin time. An idea of their misery is provided by the influx of half-starved Bedouin into the larger towns, especially perhaps Medina, and the frequent spectacle of hungry tribesmen collecting at the halts on the road between Jedda and that place. Mortality is said to have been high among these unfortunates. The misery of the tribes themselves has been intensified by the demands of the Government for alleged military purposes. Some at least have suffered from a depletion of live-stock, both the camels which are their mainstay and sheep and goats. Early in September the inspired £t Umm-al-Qura” newspaper contradicted a report of famine in the Hejaz which had been circulated in India. At the end of the year such reports, if difficult to substantiate, could not be disregarded. Even less information of real value is available regarding Nejd. 145. There was much talk during the year of the development of new economic resources. The subject was ventilated at the National Conference in June. The debates produced little but pious hopes, significantly accompanied by the stress laid on the principle that the expert assistance required and the concerns to exploit new sources should be Moslem. The King, however, had already taken one practical step. When the American millionaire, Mr. C. R. Crane, visited Jedda at the end of February, the conversation turned on water. Mr. Crane offered to send to the Hejaz the engineer who has been making a road in the Yemen under his auspices, a Mr. Twitched. This gentleman arrived on the 17th April, and was given unusual facilities for research. He made one survey in the region round about Jedda, another much more extensive along the northern littoral. The first accounts circulated in May of the results he had achieved were glowing. He had not only found much water in every direction, but had located an important petroleum field between El Labana and Muwellah, places not far south of the Gulf of Aqaba and a rich gold mine in the neighbourhood of Wejh. 146. In due course Mr. TwitchelTs reports were published in instalments in the &lt;c Umm-al-Qura.” He disabused the Government of the idea that the underground water was such as could be raised by artesian wells, the very name of which, transmuted into a perfect Arabic plural, had bemused the King and others. He described in detail many water points, where primitive wells already existed to tap water close to the surface. He recommended the use of American windmills with simple pumping apparatus. He indicated the cereals, fruits and vegetables which might, in his opinion, be grown in the neighbourhood of those wells and certain watercourses. He suggested that further help in the choice of crops and seeds might be obtained from the Department of Agriculture at Washington. 147. Space does not admit of any full account of Mr. Twitchell’s other results, as disclosed in his published reports. He reviewed the indications which he had collected in connexion with a large range of minerals, comprising mica, iron, talc, coal, emery, gypsum, sulphur, guano and lead, in addition to gold, silver and petroleum. His conclusions were throughout guarded, and in some cases discouraging. He held out rather vague hopes in connexion with some of the minerals named in the earlier part of the foregoing list. He was more optimistic regarding gold with associated silver and petroleum. He indicated the possibilities of finding alluvial gold in the coastal region from Yambo50 to Muweila, and of exploiting the same metal by the use of modern methods at places 20 odd miles to the south-east of Wejh, in one at least of which the remains of old workings existed. He had noted with pleasure the prospects of petroleum in a long strip of land'varying from 2 to 15 kilom. in depth, stretching from Umm Lajj to Muweila, and suggested further research in that region to the north and south of it and on both sides of Yambo. 148. Mr. Twitched revisited Jedda about the end of June and arranged with the Director-General of Finance for the engagement of six experts, of whom he was to be the head. He then went to the United States to recruit this staff and to buy machinery. He returned on the 19th October with one assistant only and one windmill. In the interval there had been other discoveries of gold. The position at the end of the year was that the windmill had been erected at the Waziriya wells, some 10 miles from Jedda, and steps were being taken to repair a disused Turkish conduit connecting those wells with the town; Mr. Twitchell’s assistant was at work in one of the potential gold areas somewhere in the Taif district, and Mr. Twitched himself had been summoned to Nejd, with a view, apparently, to his investigating possibilities on the Hasa Coast. 149. Mr. 1 witched may be said, without detracting from the value of his work, to have brought existing knowledge up to date rather than to have made any startling new discoveries. It is certain that the resources of the Hejaz in water, though limited, might be put to better use than they are at present. The expeditions in search of gold, conducted by the late Sir R. F. Burton under the auspices of the Egyptian Government in 1877, led to no practical results. Mr Twitched probably covered a somewhat different area, and it is possible that modern methods might make the exploitation more profitable now than it seemed likely to be half a century ago. Petroleum also was previously known, and Mr. Twitched does not appear to have done more than indicate the lines on which the possibility of its commercial exploitation in the Northern Heiaz might be further explored. 150. It may be noted incidentally that Mr. Crane’s promptitude in producing Mr. Twitched led to the abandonment by the Hejazi Government of another plan which had taken definite shape in May, that of engaging a Swedish geological mission to prospect for oil, and perhaps other minerals. The Swedish Government were prepared to provide a mission, subject to certain conditions ln - l 6 ®? 01186 a request addressed to them, but the request was subsequently withdrawn with an intimation that the task had been entrusted to an American 151. Mineral developments in Hejaz-Nejd might prove to be of interest to British enterprise. Mr. Philby stated in June that the King had told him in a moment of expansion that he would grant a concession for ad the minerals in the country to anyone who could give him a million pounds. He received a favourable reply to an enquiry as to whether this meant business, in which case something practical might be arranged without plunging into millions He then enlisted the interest of Midian (Limited), a company of old standing which seems to have amalgamated with his own Sharqieh (Limited) in 1926, though it still carries on business under its own name. Midian (Limited) is a small concern with a nominal capital of £32,500 and an issued capital of £16 908 15s They were m negotiation with the Ottoman Government before the war for a mining concession m Palestine and the Hejaz, but have never been able to prove that they obtained it. At a later date they thought of approaching King Hussein Except for any influence that Mr. Philby may still have, their prospects of doing ig business m the Hejaz seem to be small. The odds would appear to be on Mr. Twitched s American friends, unless they prefer to confine themselves to selling windmills and other plant. 152. In contrast with the great expectations raised by Mr. Twitched’s fn P iom tlOI T’j. th Tn 1S hUle t0 reCOrc } in the way of actual econ omic development in 1931. The following paragraphs sum up the available information very A cjriculture. 153. There is no evidence of Hejaz. No information is available any important agricultural progress in the regarding Nejd. The position in regard to51 191 [7104] E 2 the Akhwan colonies (see paragraph 124 of the annual report for 1930) continues to be obscure. In his lecture to the Near and Middle East Association on the 4th December the Hejazi Minister in London dwelt on the excellence of Ibn Sand’s plan of creating villages wherever water existed with a view to the con version of wandering Bedouin into settled and orderly members of the community. His statement that the Bedouin of a short time ago could hardly be recognised in the agriculturists of to-day must be regarded as premature. Roads. 154. Roads in Hejaz-Nejd amount to little more than usable tracks. These are to some extent being improved. The journey by car from Mecca to Riadh can now be undertaken in the confident expectation of completing it in from three to five days, and the King’s head chauffeur is said to have made it by a tour de force in thirty-one hours. A new road for cars between Mecca and Arafat was opened in 1931. Improvements were effected in the route between Jedda and Jizan in order to facilitate through communication by car. Little seems to have been done to improve road communication in the Northern Hejaz. Mr. Twitchell suggested that the roads from Jedda to Mecca and Medina should first be repaired, and then the road from Yambo to Muweila. He recommended the use of American road-clearing apparatus, costing £410 per set. Much attention was given during the year to a project for organising an overland motor route for pilgrims from Iraq to the Holy Cities. Certain reports regarding the progress towards the realisation of this scheme were premature, but it must be regarded as being within the range of practical politics if only because of the interest shown in it by Nuri Pasha, the energetic Prime Minister of Iraq. Little or nothing was heard during the year of the similar scheme ventilated in 1930 for a trans-peninsular route from the Hasa Coast (or, it may here be added, of the Junkers scheme for transporting pilgrims by air). Little importance can be attached at present to the activities of certain British interests, which have nibbled at the idea of equipping the Hejaz with roads and/or railways. His Majesty’s Government were consulted on this subject by Messrs. Lewenz and Wilkinson (Limited) and a group represented by a rather nebulous Sir Logie Elphinstone. No encouragement could be given to them in present circumstances. The person primarily responsible for the ventilation of the schemes would appear to have been one Sheikh Muhammad Crabtree, an enterprising renegade with a varigated past, who has, or had, some connexion with Mr. Philby. Transport. 155. The increasing substitution of motor transport for camels, especially in the pilgrim area, creates an economic problem which assumed a concrete form in 1931. It has a depressing effect, not only on camel owners, but on trades indirectly interested in camel transport, notably the town carpenters who make litters. It also drains money out of the country, all the more because of the wastage of cars due to bad roads and inefficient handling. The subject was discussed at the National Conference. There were advocates at that time of the extreme course of prohibiting motors altogether. The King evidently saw that he could not thus deprive pilgrims of the advantage of modern conveniences; but it may be noted that in December an old and inoperative order was renewed prohibiting the importation of cars except with the permission of the Govern ment. This seemed unlikely to have any serious effect. The motor vehicle has clearly come to the Hejaz to stay, although, in remote regions, nature is still justified of her camels, as in the case of Mr. Bertram Thomas’s iourney across the Ruba-al-Khali. Wireless, 156. After various preliminaries, including the return of a satisfactory reply by His Majesty’s Government to enquiries by the Hejazi Minister in London regarding the adequacy of the proposed equipment and the reasonable ness of the price, the bulk of the material for the eleven wireless stations and four mobile sets which the Marconi Company had contracted to supply was52 r y delivered in Jedda in April and June. The material for the station at Qaf, on the Transjordan frontier, was sent to Beirut, and that for the Persian Gulf stations to Pas Tanura. The contractors sent out two experts, an experienced British member of their staff and an Egyptian. Progress in erecting the stationary sets was very slow owing to the hesitations of the Hejazi authorities. It had been hoped that the British expert, Mr. Boucicault, would personally erect one of the two large (6 kilowatt) stations at Riadh, and that his Moslem colleague would then set up the similar station at Mecca. The King decided not to allow Mr. Boucicault to go to Riadh and everything went slowly there, perhaps owing to the difficulty of choosing a site, perhaps also because of the opposition of the ulema, whose scruples the King was, nevertheless, determined to override. The position at the end of the year appeared to be that stations had been completed at Hofuf, Buraida, Tebuk and perhaps Hail, and mobile sets were in use at Mecca and Riadh. Even these facilities, added to those provided by the old Turkish sets at Jedda and elsewhere, effected an enormous improvement in internal communications. Ports. 157. No important port works were undertaken in 1931. Some new buoys were laid in Jedda harbour early in the year. Serviceable new beacons were provided at Yambo to replace two which had been swept away in January. As stated in paragraph 50 above, no progress would appear to have been made with the project of creating a port at Ras Tanura, on the Hasa Coast. The most urgent requirement under this heading is improvement at Jedda. On the 1st February the Amir Feisal assured Sir A. Ryan in private conversation that the matter was engaging the earnest attention of the Hejazi Government. In August His Majesty’s consul-general at Beirut reported a curious story about a group of Moslem nationalists there who were supposed to be in communication with the Hejazi Minister in London regarding a scheme for constructing a port at Jedda, which Ibn Saud himself was said to have initiated subject to the condition that the group undertaking the work and the capital should be entirely oriental. Notwithstanding this proviso, the Beirut Moslems were said to have approached a local Christian, who, having himself no capital, was prepared to enlist foreign support sub rosa. This gentleman also enquired as to the possibility of getting the Hejazi Government to put up £5,000 themselves for a preliminary survey. His Majesty’s Government thought the whole of this story very queer and preferred not to pursue a suggestion that steps might possibly be taken to interest British capital. 158. The commercial statistics which were stated by Fuad Bey Hamza towards the end of 1930 to be in preparation had not appeared up to the end of 1931. It is still impossible to deal with the trade of the Hejaz except in the most general fashion. Visible exports are almost negligible in a country which subsists almost entirely on its one great invisible export, its holiness in Moslem eyes. There is a small export of hides and skins from Jedda and of various oddments, like water melons and penny fans. There is some little outward trade elsewhere, e.g., in charcoal from Yambo and Wejh. The import trade is much more important, but was affected in 1931 by the general depression described earlier in this section and perhaps by the adverse effect of increased customs duties. A note on the general character of the import trade forms Appendix No. 2 to this report. 159. Even less can be said about the external trade of Nejd. It passes largely through Bahrein, a place which serves as an entrepot for imports like cotton goods, rice, &amp;c., and exports like dates. Other centres through which some of the Nejdi trade may pass are Koweit (though Ibn Saud’s embargo affects this port very adversely), Muscat and Debai. Some sidelights on the matter may be derived from a report based on information from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which was issued by the Department of Overseas Trade in October 1931. It may be supposed, for’instance, that a fair proportion of the cotton piece-goods imported into the four ports just named, which were then stated to amount to some £400,000 worth in a good year, find their way into Nejd.53 [7104] E 3 160. The movement of shipping at Jedda in 1931 was as follows With Cargoes. In Ballast. Entered— No. Tonnage. No. Tonnage. British 140 188,330 8 20,378 Other flags 111 243,462 17 72,607 Cleared— British 91 97,174 57 111,534 Other flags 60 74,288 68 241,781 161. The question of a commercial treaty between Great Britain and Hejaz-Nejd (see paragraph 129 of the annual report for 1931) was not pursued in 1931. Ibn Saud’s proposal that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom should act as his intermediaries for purchases also disappeared from the scene as a result of the negative attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government, who, on the 15th January, furnished the Legation in Jedda with the material for a considered reply. They could not, they explained, act as buyers on behalf of the King, although they would be willing to give advice in connexion with particular transactions of importance, as they had done in the case of the Marconi wireless contract. They drew attention to the desirability of doing business through established houses (e.g., Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., whom Sir A. Ryan was given discretion to name specifically, if he thought it well to do so) and the importance of following sound methods as regards punctual payment, &amp;c. V.— Military Organisation. 162. Little can be added to what was said on this subject in paragraph 133 ff. of the annual report for 1930, in which, inter alia, some account was given of the embryo regular army. Unfortunately for that experiment, the Director-General of Military Organisation, Faudhi Bey Kawokji, fell into disfavour for some obscure reason, possibly connected with Shereefian sympathies or personal ambition, about the middle of May, when he either resigned or was dismissed. Ibn Saud found no one better to replace him than a certain Hamdi Bey, previously commanding officer of the Jedda garrison, this man is a Kurd, who is understood to have risen from the ranks to the post of lieutenant in the Turkish army, the type of person who would be useful in a scrap, but with neither the knowledge nor the experience required for organisation; an intriguer to boot. The bulk of the army was removed later from Jedda to Mecca. It was no longer possible to watch its evolution, but it may safely be assumed that no progress of importance had been made with the scheme up to the end of the year. Ibn Saud must still rely on the retainers of himself and his Amirs and on tribal levies for any important military purpose. VI.— Aviation and Connected Matters. 163. Nothing happened in 1931 to repair the lamentable state into which the Hejazi Air Force had fallen by the end of 1930, when all the mechanics resigned, and two of the remaining British pilots, Messrs. Morris and North, were at daggers drawn with the third, Mr. Lowe. In January the last of the mechanics were filling in their time pending their departure, which took place on the 11th February. Mr. Lowe was intriguing behind the chief pilot’s back with certain local officers. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom were concerned over the situation. They still hoped that the elimination of Mr. Lowe might do good. His Majesty’s Minister, acting on their instructions, strongly advocated this in a conversation with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin on the 2nd February. His advice was not taken then or later, although Messrs. Morris and North had threatened to resign if Mr. Lowe were not removed. The King’s only idea was that he wanted to be quit of all three, but without dismissing them, and to obtain the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in recruiting a new staff of pilots and mechanics. So far as the remnant of the original force is concerned, it is not worth while to recapitulate in detail the story of hesitancy and intrigue, which ended in Messrs. Morris and North tendering their resignations early in April.wmmmmmmMmm* 54 These were not accepted at once, but it was arranged in May that the four Wapitis and other material should be taken over by a commission of military officers and experts. The principal of these was Mr. Lowe, with whom was associated a local German, named Krakowsky, who had for some years eked out a precarious livelihood in Jedda, and some nondescript mechanics. Messrs. Morris ^ and North finally left Jedda on the 18th July, after much delay due to a demand by the Government that the former should account in detail for all material originally delivered at Darin Island, and later, when this question had been adjusted with the assistance of the Legation, to difficulties in making provision for the payment of monies due to the two pilots. 164. The transfer to the commission opened a new and almost more miserable chapter in the history of the air force. Lowe and Krakowsky fell out. The former was denied access to the aerodrome by the guard on duty there one day in July. After various vicissitudes, including an attempt on his part to reinstate himself by entering into a clandestine contract with the Director- General of Military Organisation, which the Government cancelled in due course, and difficulties over the liquidation of his position vis-a-vis of the authorities, in which the Legation became to some extent involved, he left Jedda on the 20th September. While all this was brewing, circumstances arose in which Ibn Saud was anxious to use the aeroplanes. He wished to make a show with them at Jizan in connexion with his quarrel with the Imam Yahya and the troubles in Asir. Lowe was still in Jedda, and, whatever his other drawbacks, he knew how to fly; but by this time he was incapacitated by ear trouble. A Syrian adventurer, whom the Hejazi Government had engaged as part of their provisional organisation, proved incapable of handling a Wa.piti. Neither flogging nor imprisonment made him any better. A Turkish mechanic of sorts, who also hesitated, was mauled by Nejdi soldiers, and took refuge in the Turkish Legation. On the 13th September the German Krakowsky was pulled out of his bed, where he lay ill with dysentery, and order to fly to jizan. He started, but, after a few minutes, fainted, and his machine glided into the Jedda lagoon. The accident was not fatal to the pilot, but it destroyed any further chance of utilising the aeroplanes. They remained useless and more or less derelict up to the end of the year. 165. Ibn Saud had pursued his idea of recruiting a new air force with British personnel. On the 19th March, following on earlier conversations, Sheikh Yussuf Yasin wrote to Sir A. Ryan definitely requesting British assistance. The King’s idea at this time was to engage four pilots and six mechanics as before, but he thought he should be able to get them cheaper. Early in May Sir A. Ryan communicated the views of His Majesty’s Government, which were that they were willing to help, but that the salaries previously paid must be regarded as a minimum, which might, indeed, have to be exceeded, and that the removal of Lowe must be an essential condition of assistance being rendered. The Hejazis clung to the hope of securing men at lower rates. The attitude of His Majesty’s Government was redefined on the 6th June, when the Hejazi Government were informed that His Majesty’s Government could only help them, if assured (a) that the new personnel would receive satisfactory treatment as regards pay, &amp;c.; and (b) that a complete break would be made with the past. His Majesty’s Government reaffirmed their previous view as regards the necessity for salaries at least as high as those previously paid. They did not insist on the immediate removal of Mr. Lowe, but asked for an undertaking that his connexion with the force would Be'severed before the new personnel reached the Hejaz. On the 17th June the Hejazi Government intimated acquiescence in the two conditions, but propounded a new scheme. They said that they proposed to recruit only four men, viz., an aviator instructor specially qualified for training, a pilot with special knowledge of aeronautical engineering, and two mechanics. They proposed, at the same time, to send a mission abroad to be trained in aviation, and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would give facilities for such a mission £o be trained in the United Kingdom. His Majesty’s Government were strongly of opinion that the question of a mission, which was surrounded by various practical difficulties, including that of instructing men unversed in English, should be postponed pending the recruitment of new personnel. They were prepared to try to find the latter on the new basis proposed, subject to certain elucidations. There ensued further negotiations,&lt;^4 [7104] e 4 f;j which, in the end, proved abortive. This was due as much as anything to a desire on the part of Ibn Saud to be free to use the personnel for all purposes. He objected to the reinsertion in any new contracts of a clause in the old entitling the British staff to resign in the event of war. His Majesty’s ^ Government were unwilling to concede this point. Indeed, at the stage now reached, they began to conceive grave doubts as to the desirability of allowing British personnel to be used even for the repression of internal disorder. Both sides were thinking of a situation different from that which had existed when the original Air Force was recruited in 1929. Ibn Saud, apart from his difficulties elsewhere, was confronted with a danger of definitely foreign hostilities in one direction, the Yemen; while the area of possible disaffection was so much wider than it had been towards the close of the 1929 rebellion that the use of British personnel to cope with it might, it was thought by His Majesty’s Government, expose them to odium in the eyes of Indian Moslems. In the event, this latter question of internal use did not actually arise with Ibn Saud. His Government were informed on the 30th September that His Majesty’s Government could in no circumstances agree to British personnel taking part in hostilities against any foreign Power. This caused the negotiations to peter out finally in the second half of November, after some further exchange of views, in the course of which His Majesty’s Government rejected as unpractical a Hejazi suggestion that the proposed British staff might be used for instructional purposes only, and flying personnel recruited elsewhere. His Majesty’s Government discouraged also an idea broached privately by Fuad Bey Hamza to Mr. Hope Gill on the 7th November, that they might be willing to offer the King a British air mission. 166. It may be unfortunate from some points of view that these transactions should have destroyed, so far as can be judged at present, all prospect of further British participation in an air force created under British auspices as recently as a couple of years ago. It is possible that, if the personnel recruited in 1929 had been more happily chosen, the story would have had a happier ending. To that extent His Majesty’s Government do not emerge from the affair without some diminution of credit. Otherwise, however, the fiasco must be attributed to the ineptitude of the Hejazi Government who showed no capacity for managing the force, no inclination to use it intelligently and no readiness to make the conditions of service really tolerable for the men employed. In cannot be supposed that there would have been much improvement in these respects had new British personnel been supplied. In one direction there was every prospect of deteriora tion, i.e., as regards delay in the payment of salaries. There is, moreover, nothing to show definitely that the presence of British airmen in Ibn Saud’s air force would improve the chances of British participation in future aerial developments in Hejaz-Nejd or of the King taking a less jealous view of the frequentation of his territory by British aircraft. In the opinion of the writer of this report His Majesty’s Government were well, if rather ingloriously, out of a bad business when the negotiations described above broke down. 167. One of the matters outstanding at the end of 1930 was the request of the Hejazi Government for assistance in obtaining instructional machines, machine guns and spare parts. The material for a reply to these requests was sent tc the Legation in January and February, but was held in reserve owing to the tense situation over the Transjordan frontier question. The reply was eventually sent to the Hejazi Government on the 18th May. A month later they explained that they preferred to postpone consideration of the matter owing to the lack of technical experts. In June they made a separate request for facilities for the shipment to Jedda via Bahrein and India of 500 bombs, being half a total number of 1,000 which had been supplied with the original material for the air force, but had been left at Darin Island when it was transferred to Jedda. It was agreed that this shipment might be made, subject to compliance with Board of Trade regulations and measures to separate the detonators from the bombs. 168. Little progress was made with the question of obtaining Ibn Saud’s consent to British aircraft flying over his territory adjoining the Persian Gulf. The King had given no indication of the results of the study of this matter by his local authorities (see annual report for 1930, paragraphs 142-143). Early56 in 1931 Sir A. Ryan sought up-to-date instructions. He was informed at the end of February that the project for pearling flights between Bahrein and Iraq had been dropped. His Majesty’s Government were, however, anxious in connexion with possible air routes down the Persian Gulf, to secure facilities for the use of the Hasa Coast by British aircraft, whether military or civil. They did not desire any general permission to fly over Nejd territory, but an assurance that aircraft compelled to enter or alight therein should receive general assistance and good treatment and that no objection would be raised to the despatch of any necessary assistance by air. They wished that pilots should have knowledge of the position of landing grounds between Koweit and Bahrein, of which there should preferably be three, to be spaced at intervals of about 60 miles and to be chosen, if possible, in consultation with the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq. * 169. Owing to the tension over the Transjordan frontier question, action was delayed until the 21st April when Sir A. Ryan intimated in general terms to luad Bey Hamza his intention of making renewed representations, but agreed to await a more complete detente in the relations between the two Governments before doing so. On the 28th May he handed to Fuad Bey a memorandum based on the Foreign Office instructions of February, omitting however any reference to a particular number of landing grounds or to possible consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq. Fuad Bey stated that his Government was preparing regulations which would give evidence of a more liberal attitude than had previously been observed towards foreign aircraft, although there would be a highly centralised control. This project was again referred to in a not very satisfactory official reply of the 18th June at the end of which it was said that, pending the completion of the new regulations, the Hejazi Government wished ‘ ‘ to enquire of the British Government as to the terms on which a mutual agreement can be come to on this subject with a view to their studying such terms also.’’ Surmising that this obscure phrase had reference to the possibility of a financial deal, Sir A. Ryan enquired what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government if this proved to be the case. 1/ 0. The Minister s surmise was confirmed by a subsequent conversation with luad Bey, whose language suggested that his Government had their eye on the arrangements between the Persian Government and Imperial Airways and were unwilling to commit themselves without seeing what they might hope to extract from that company or from His Majesty’s Government. It appeared from instructions sent to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at the end of August that the interest of Imperial Airways in the matter had diminished as they proposed to use flying-boats instead of land-planes in the event of their transferring the Persian Gulf section of the air service to India from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. Flis Majesty’s Government thought that this would do away with the necessity for any arrangements to enable the company to use the Hasa Coast, but they were still anxious to secure the facilities already indicated for military aircraft. In October Mr. Hope Gill thought that the matter might be handled in conjunction with Ibn Saud’s desire to get new British personnel for his air force and that the King’s consent to the use of landing grounds on a rental basis might be obtained as a quid r pvo quo for the assistance he was seeking in the matter of the personnel, but he doubted whether His Majesty would accept a rental of less than £1,000 gold per annum. Very soon after Mr. Hope Gill had reported in this sense, all prospect of the air force being restaffed with British personnel disappeared. The question of landing grounds again fell to be pursued independently and in conditions all the more unpropitious as the Air Ministry considered the suggested rental of £1,000 gold to be excessive. Considering how little they were asking for, no more indeed than might be looked for on grounds of humanity and international courtesy, they suggested than an annual rent of £50 for each landing ground would compensate the Hejaz Government for any necessary expenditure in maintenance and the renewal of markings. These views were communicated by the Foreign Office to the Legation on the 2nd December with instructions to follow the matter up at a suitable opportunity. It was still outstanding at the end of the year. So apparently was the question of the proposed Hejazi regulations of which nothing further was heard.57 # 171. On more than one occasion during the year the Hejazi Government displayed their usual sensitiveness regarding the alleged violation of their terri tory by British aircraft, both on the Transjordan side and on the Hasa Coast. It is unnecessary to go into the details of these complaints. It may be said of them in general that they always lack precision in regard to essential details and are sometimes wholly vague. As a rule they prove to be unfounded, although it does occasionally happen that British airmen lose their bearings and do not quite know where they are in the super-air of deserts or that they become involved in trouble which necessitates alighting on or close to the coast of Nejd. VII.— Legislation. 172. The difficulties of giving any satisfactory account of Hejazi legisla tion were explained in section VII of the annual report for 1930. In 1931 Fuad Bey Hamza was compelled to admit that a commission appointed to make a collection of existing laws and regulations had found them in such a hopeless mess that it had broken down in its efforts. The conditions in which this report has been prepared make it impossible to give a complete account even of the regulations published in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” in 1931. In these circumstances any attempt to deal with the subject comprehensively is deferred. Mention may, however, be made of a few enactments of special interest to foreigners, as follows :— (a) Law on Nationality. —The law of 1926 was amended and extended to the whole of Ibn Baud’s dominions by a further law published in February 1931. The amendments were such as to remove the more serious objections to the original law on the part of His Majesty’s Government. A translation of the consolidated text was appended to the Jedda bi-monthly report for January-February 1931. (b) Legalisation of Documents. —A comprehensive regulation on this subject was published in February. Some of its requirements were stringent, but there was nothing in it to which exception could be taken. (c) Regulation on Pilgrim Passes. —See paragraph 182. (d) Firearms. —In the spring a regulation was issued establishing a licensing system for the trade in firearms and the carrying of them by private individuals. (e) Commercial Law. —At the end of the year the “ Umm-al-Qura ” was still publishing instalments of a commercial code of formidable dimensions. (f) Miscellaneous. —Various regulations were issued regarding the religious courts, Wakfs, the Hejazi civil service, &amp;c. VIII.— Press. 173. The weekly “ Umm-al-Qura ” continues to be the only paper published in Hejaz-Nejd. It retained throughout 1931 its character of an inspired organ, not recognised as having an official character. The publicity given in its columns to certain political matters was noteworthy, as, for instance, when it produced attacks on the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan known to have been written by Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, broadcasted the correspondence between the Kin' and the Ulema of Nejd about the impropriety of annual accession celebra tions, and refuted in language less bald than that of a mere dementi a report circulated abroad that Ibn Saud contemplated abdication. 174. The official Press Bureau published a certain number of communiques, but did not otherwise make itself felt as far afield as Jedda. Very little news expressly intended for publication reaches the outside world from the Hejaz. One,of the few advantages of diplomacy there is that it is possible to conduct discussions even so controversial as that over the Transjordan frontier without attracting the smallest attention in the outer world. Even the letters which Mr. Philby used to send to the “ Near East ” ceased to appear after about the middle of 1931, as he still prefers to write nil nisi bonum about Ibn Saud and could find nothing good to write. The Hejazi Government themselves appear58 to have no organised propaganda service, though they from time to time show attention to itinerant publicists like M. Ameen Rihani, the author of books on Arabia, who visited Jedda in June, and a less notable person of somewhat the: same type, Yunus Bahri-al-Iraqi, a much-wandered Moslem journalist of Mosul origin. Another Moslem, Tewfik Bey Sherif, a political adventurer of Syrian and remoter Yemen origin, once an officer in the Turkish army, attracted attention in the autumn by publishing attacks in India on the Saudian regime. He had previously floated in and out of the Hejaz, serving, or aspiring to serve, the King, but fled from Jedda mysteriously in the early summer. 175. Such meagre snippets are all that can be recorded under this heading. While Mr. Philby sulks, Ibn Saud’s best propagandist abroad is probably the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London, who figures from time to time as a writer and a lecturer. He displayed great gifts of constructive imagination in a lengthy address on Ibn Saud, which he delivered to the Near and Middle East Association on the 4th December. IX.— Education. 176. Pressure of other work has made it impossible to obtain a more comprehensive view of education in Hejaz-Nejd than that given in the corresponding section of the annual report for 1930. X. —The Pilgrimage. 177. Frequent reference is made in this report to the effects of the great falling off in the number of overseas pilgrims who came to the Hejaz in 1931. Its extent may be judged by the following table, which gives the estimated numbers for five years in the same form and subject to the same reservations as in the annual report for 1930 :— Nationality. 1927. 1928. 1929. 1930. 1931. British and British administered. Indian 20,496 13,954 15,146 11,061 7,276 Malayan 29,604 4,418 1,455 2,590 506 West African 589 2,051 2.338 3.525 1,558 Sudanese 957 2.014 1,371 1,065 588 Palestinian .. 333 471 558 383 447 Dutch East Indian 39,704 42,730 31,119 32,000 16,803 Egyptian 15,547 14,099 18,522 17,127 4,967 Other, including minor British elements .. 18,879 21,030 18,029 17,070 7,201 Total 132,109 100,767 88,538 84,821 39,346 178. These figures suffice to give a general idea of the size of recent pilgrimages. The total for 1931 should not be judged with reference to that for 1927, which was abnormally high for reasons connected with earlier vicissitudes. It may be contrasted more fairly with the totals for 1929 and 1930, which may be regarded as normally good years, so far as it is possible to speak of normality in this connexion. The decline in 1931 as compared with those two years will be seen to have affected every important national element in the pilgrimage, notably the Indian, the Dutch East Indian and Malayan and the Egyptian. In these and in most other cases the falling off must be attributed mainly to economic depression in the countries of origin. In one or two special instances it was due to the action of the authorities of those countries. Thus the French authorities in Algeria prohibited the pilgrimage on the ostensible or real ground of the existence of plague there, with the result that the number of pilgrims from Algeria and Tunis fell from the already much reduced figure of 1,155 in 1930 to sixty-seven in 1931, and the Persian Government so discouraged it that the number from that country fell from 3,337 to eighty-eight in the same two years respectively.59 He 179. The 9th Zil-Hijja, the day on which all pilgrims congregate on Mount Arafat, fell on Tuesday, the 28th April. The total assemblage may be put conjecturally at some 50,000 souls, including those from various parts of Arabia, whose numbers were swelled by an unusually large overland contingent from the Yemen, while, owing doubtless to the poverty prevailing in Ibn Saud’s dominions, there were feW pilgrims from Nejd, and even the inhabitants of Mecca did not attend in their usual force. In general the pilgrimage conditions in the Ilejaz were not greatly different from those in 1930. Health conditions before, during and after the pilgrimage were excellent. The proportion of mortality was unusually low. These facts must be ascribed rather to the clemency of the season and the small numbers involved than to any improvement in the Hejazi sanitary arrangements. The religious intolerance natural to a Wahhabi regime was tempered by a politic tolerance, though it was still potent enough to outrage the sentiments of many pilgrims, especially those of the Shia denominations, who complained, moreover, of being subjected to discriminatory taxation. 180. Pilgrims suffered in various ways from the effects of financial stringency in their countries of origin and in the Hejaz. Their purchasing power was reduced. The Hejazi Government sought to offset the reduction in t icii number by greater rigour in the collection of charges and to some extent by increasing taxation. 181. Security, the greatest boon conferred on pilgrims by Ibn Saud, was again well maintained throughout the pilgrim area. There was perhaps an increase in pilferage, e.q., at Muzdalafa, the halt on the way back from Arafat to Mina. There was little or no change for the better m the condition ot the roads, which continue to impose a heavy strain on the motor transport now so widely used to carry pilgrims on the longer journeys, although the bulk ot len heavy luggage is still carried on camel back. Conditions between Mecca and Arafat the most congested area, were improved by the opening of a new road for motors and by confining within narrow limits the privilege of using cars tor this particular journey. The working of the transport system as a whole gave rise, as usual, to much complaint. The problems forced on the attention of the King and his advisers had much to do with the detailed arrangements for regulating motor transport, the repercussion of its increased use on the interests of the camel owners and others interested in camel transport, and the eternal question of the mutawwif, or pilgrim guide organisation. 182 It would overload this report to go into the details of the problems iust mentioned. It must suffice to say that in the latter part of the year the Government showed an inclination to remedy some of the grievances which had a G ri™ connexion with the 1931 pilgrimage. They had de ayed the pubheataon of the tariff of authorised charges for that year until Januaiy 1931 They mat c up for this by producing the tariff for 1932 m July, a show of zeal deserving o all commendation, although it had unfortunate later consequences owmg to the mnnpturv crisis resulting from the abandonment of the gold standara oy Great Britain They rescinded in the autumn an objectionable regulation which had been promulgated suddenly on the 3rd April empowering mutawwifs to impound the travelling papers of pilgrims for the duration of their stay in the Heiaz and to use them, as it were, as a security for the payment of dues. W ha is needed however, is a root and branch reform of the whole of the arrangements fL transDortine and guiding pilgrims. Reference is made elsewhere to the prominence givefi to pilgrimage matters in the agenda of the National Conference which sat in June. 183 The disposal of the 1931 pilgrimage was effected without undue Alexandria Quarantine B , 0 f t rd ,^ la o 1 ^' “ e ‘yg g e dis( ? 0V ery of actual or probable „ repatriated. pad &amp; sas s.60 Government of India in 1929 continued to engage the attention of that Govern ment throughout 1931. In July the Legation in Jedda completed a series of despatches begun in the previous year on the various subjects directly concerning it, including the organisation of its Indian and medical sections, the proposed substitution of the deposit system for that of return tickets, the problem of destitution and many others. An understanding was reached, subject to the ~ elucidation of minor points of detail, among the various authorities concerned on one question which had been the subject of separate correspondence, namely, the conditions under which ships returning to India and Malaya should be dispensed from the necessity for calling at Kamaran for medical inspection. f 185. The question of improved control of the pilgrimage from Nigeria was settled in the autumn, when the Government of that colony expressed concurrence in proposals on which the Sudan Government and His Majesty’s Legation had - agreed as a result of a visit to Jedda by the Commissioner for Port Sudan in the spring. 186. The 1931 pilgrimage presented few features of political interest. At the usual annual banquet to leading pilgrims of all nationalities, Ibn Saud spoke with the vigour habitual to him on such occasions. He dwelt on the paramount necessity for unity of thought and action in the Moslem world, the importance of the Haj as an institution having for its primary purpose the assemblage of Moslems from different countries, the fallacy of reliance on the aping of Western civilisation and his own indifference to all ambition or any object other than the glory of God and Islam. A tribute paid by an Egyptian speaker to the Indian leader Shauqat Ali elicited from His Majesty an angry denunciation of that personage, whom he condemned more particularly for having spoken of ‘ ‘ our brethren the Jews.” The King disclaimed all friendship with either Jews or Christians. Among the guests at the banquet were King Amanullah of Afghanistan, the political aspect of whose adventure in the Hejaz is described elsewhere; Prince Ahmed Tevfid of Turkey, who made the pilgrimage less conspicuously; and Sir Abdul Kerim Ghuznavi, a member of the Council of the Governor of Bengal, who made it as conspicuously as he could, and went away full of admiration for Ibn Saud and all his works. It is only necessary to add that there was again, in the circumstances described in paragraph 90, no Sacred Caravan from Egypt. 187. No attempt has been made in this section to do more than glance at the salient aspects of the 1931 pilgrimage and the more important questions considered during the year. The whole subject is dealt with fully in the usual separate report prepared by the Legation in Jedda. Reference may also be made to paragraph 154 of the present report, which deals briefly with a subject of growing importance, that of the opening up of overland motor routes for pilgrims. XI.— Slavery and the Slave Trade. 188. There is little to add to the review in paragraph 176 of the general situation in regard to the slave trade across the Red Sea and slavery in Hejaz-Nejd. There was no modification in 1931 of the British naval arrangements, nor was any decision taken regarding the creation of an improved intelligence service. It may be assumed that, even if any important extension of the British machinery for repressing traffic in slaves was considered otherwise feasible, it would now be barred by the necessity for rigid economy in public expenditure. The French and Italian authorities manifested, if possible, less interest than before in the question of slavery. Both Governments abandoned any attempt to secure the inclusion in their projected treaties with Ibn Saud of an c article binding him to co-operate in measures to repress the slave trade. When Admiral Deville, Commander-in-chief of the French naval division in the Levant, visited the Red Sea in February, he did not conceal from the British senior naval officer the indifference with which his Government regarded the matter. As for Ibn Saud himself, he made no move towards a European attitude. When the subject was discussed with his Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey gave renewed assurances that measures were really in force to restrain traffic in slaves in accordance with article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda. There is no61 m means of verifying such assurances or of determining the efficacy of the measures prescribed. Fuad Bey likes to make the most of them, as one of the dreams of his life is to induce His Majesty’s Government to abandon an attitude which he regards as derogating from their otherwise complete respect for the independence of his sovereign and his adopted country. 189. The continued exercise by the British Legation of the right of manumitting slaves who seek asylum gave rise to various difficulties in 1931. In a minority of cases, usually those of certain female slaves, it is possible to induce their late owners to emancipate them, and no necessity arises for sending them out of the country. In a practical sense, such persons undoubtedly owe their freedom, for what it may subsequently be worth, to the fact that they have been able to seek asylum, but its legal value derives from the emancipation there agreed to by the owner than to any act of manumission performed by the Legation. In practically all other cases the only way to secure the refugee against re-enslavement is to arrange for his departure from Hejaz-Nejd jurisdiction. The difficulties connected with this are twofold. 190. In the first place, it is now established practice that no ex-slave can be embarked without notice of his having taken refuge being given some little time beforehand to the Hejazi authorities, and he must have papers endorsed by them before he is actually put on board a ship. It is strongly believed that they exert themselves to prevent slaves taking refuge at the Legation at all. When a slave has succeeded in doing so, they are prone to delay their consent to his departure on various pretexts, like the existence, or even possible existence, of claims against him. The Legation normally finds means to overcome such opposition, when it is offered. Delay and trouble are, however, entailed, and the number of instances of Hejazi obstructiveness tends to increase. 191. The second difficulty is that of disposal. In theory it takes the form of “ repatriation,” which merely means embarking the ex-slave for the port most suitable to enable him to proceed to his presumed country of origin. “ Presumed, because in most cases the person concerned, having been enslaved in early childhood, has himself no precise knowledge of his origin, and reliance must be placed on such indications as racial characteristics, tribal marks, and suchlike. 192. Up to 1931 practically all slaves embarked by the Legation were sent either to Port Sudan or to Massowah. The authorities in the Sudan were helpful, and the demand for labour there was such that slaves theoretically in process of repatriation could be received without too much regard to their ultimate disposal. In 1931, owing to a decrease in the demand for labour, the Sudan authorities, though still very ready to help the Legation, were compelled to take a somewhat stricter view. The main difficulty, however, came from the Italian authorities in Eritrea, who, early in the year, took exception to the practice of the Legation in regard to slaves of presumed Abyssinian origin, who had hitherto been accepted at Massowah, and who had, indeed, it must be gratefully recorded, been given free passages in the Italian steamers trading from Jedda to that port. It emerged from the exchange of views in 1931, that the Eritrean authorities were only prepared in future to accept slaves fulfilling conditions so stringent that any hope of making practical use of Massowah in future had to be abandoned. 193. A minor difficulty connected with the disposal of slaves has been that no public funds are available for their repatriation. Any expenditure incurred in getting them as far as an African port has fallen on the small charity fund of the Legation in Jedda. 194. A review of the various considerations in London in October led to the conclusion that the possibility of repatriating slaves of presumed Abyssinian origin via Jibuti should be further explored. This solution had been advocated by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires in Jedda and His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa. It was open to two objections, viz., the infrequency of direct communications between Jedda and Jibuti, and the possible danger of re-onslavement at a place so close to the area of slave-running operations, though otherwise more convenient than Massowah for the onward journey into Abyssinia. The first of these questions was mainly one of expense. As regards the second, Sir S. Barton had expressed the view that it would be a sufficientsafeguard if ex-slaves were consigned to the Ethiopian consul at Jibuti, and a notification made to the Ethiopian Government in each case by the Legation at Addis Ababa. As a result of the discussion in London, it was suggested to him that he should seek the consent of the Ethiopian Government to the procedure, preferably on the understanding that they would accept any ex-slaves as to whose Abyssinian origin the Legation in Jedda had no reasonable doubt, or, if they could not agree to this, on the understanding that each case would be referred to them. It was hoped that they would, moreover, agree to the cost of repatriation. In his reply to these instructions, Sir S. Barton expressed doubt as to the utility of attempting to tie the Ethiopian Government to any general understanding, and suggested that it would be preferable to deal with individual cases as and when they might arise on the lines followed in one recent case (see the following paragraph). His despatch was still being considered at the end of the year. The question of practical arrangements for despatching ex-slaves from Jedda to Jibuti was also outstanding. There are occasional direct opportunities. Otherwise, it is necessary to arrange for transhipment, e.g., at Aden, or perhaps Port Sudan. 195. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda was compelled in 1931 to modify the opinion which he had previously held that the danger of the pilgrimage being used as a cloak for slaving transactions was not serious in present conditions. Two cases in which it had been so used came definitely to the notice of the Legation. In view of the small total number of slaves who succeed in taking refuge, it can only be surmised that these two were merely examples of a larger class. The first was the case of two lads from Addis Ababa who had been induced by a compatriot to undertake the pilgrimage early in the year and who, having accomplished it, were sold into slavery in Mecca. One of them found his way to the Legation. Subsequent enquiries established the truth of his story so completely that the Hejazi Government themselves admitted that the lads had been wrongfully enslaved. They were, in due course, repatriated by arrangement with the Ethiopian Government, who accepted liability for the expenditure involved. The second case arose in December, when a Nigerian took refuge, claiming to have been brought on pilgrimage by his master in 1930, and sold^in the Hejaz. The investigation of this case presented more difficulty, but there were strong grounds for accepting the man’s story, and the Hejazi' authorities, who had at first attempted to claim him as a Royal slave (see the following paragraph), consented to his embarkation for Port Sudan on the ground that he had been improperly enslaved while on pilgrimage. 196. The man just mentioned was one of two who fled from the house in Mecca of Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, the Director-General of Finance. In both cases the Hejazi Government claimed that they were the property of Ibn Saud and should not be given asylum or manumitted by the Legation. They relied on an alleged undertaking given by Sir G. Clayton in 1927 that the right of manumission maintained by the letters attached to the Treaty of Jedda should not be used in favour of slaves belonging to the King. Although Sir G. Clayton left no record of such an undertaking, there are reasons to suppose that he may have given some sort of assurance regarding persons employed by Ibn Saud as personal servants or soldiers. Sir A. Ryan would therefore have been prepared, following on an exchange of views at the Foreign Office in 1930, to assume the existence of an understanding which would compel him to return any slave, not demonstrably a British subject, who had actually fled from the household of the King, or, indeed, any prince immediately related to His Majesty. He was not prepared to refuse manumission to persons in the previous possession of Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman on the ground that they were claimed as being, nevertheless, the King’s property. The case of the Nigerian was speedily disposed of by the admission of the Hejazi Government that he was a wrongfully enslaved pilgrim, so that the claim of Royal ownership lapsed. The other case had important consequences, but did not come to a head until January 1932. 197. The number of slaves manumitted by the Legation in 1931 was sixteen males and six females. All except one male, who preferred to seek work locally, and thiee females emancipated by their owners, were embarked for repatriation. One Abyssinian male slave repented of his desire for freedom after coming to the Legation. One alleged Royal slave was awaiting disposal at the end of63 December. These figures are taken from periodical reports and have not been checked in Jedda for the year as a whole. 198. The question of search for slaves at sea is dealt with in the following section. XII.— Naval Matters. 199. It is perhaps unnecessary to record the fact that Ibn Saud possessed no naval equipment of any form, except by way of comment on the reservations made by his Government when agreeing to the armaments truce proposed by the League of Nations (see paragraph 109). There was no change in 1931 in the naval arrangements of the three Powers who “show the flag” in the Red Sea. His Majesty’s Government continued to maintain two sloops for the repression of the slave trade and more general purposes, H.M.S. “Lupin” replacing the long familiar “Clematis.” One or other of the two visited Jedda in February, April, July and October, the longest visit being that paid in April, when, in accordance with a now well-established tradition, H.M.S. “ Dahlia” came to the port at pilgrimage time and stayed a week. Commander R. A. Jackson vacated this ship shortly afterwards. He will be remembered for his zeal in all matters connected with slavery, and in Jedda for his wholehearted assistance in 1930 and 1931 in organising the annual Haj regatta, an old institution which was revived in 1929 after some years of abeyance. The French maintain no regular establishment in the Red Sea. The sloop “Baccarat” of the French naval division in the Levant visited Jedda in January at the time of the King’s accession celebrations. Rear-Admiral Deville, Commander-in-chief of the division, called there for two days in February, towards the end of a long tour across Syria and Iraq by land and round from the Persian Gulf by sea. There were no French naval visits, nor did either of the Italian ships based on Massowah make any appearance in Hejazi waters during the year. 200. Progress was made with the three questions dealt with in para graphs 187 to 189 of the annual report for 1930. The results may be summed up as follows :— (a) Much consideration was given to the question whether the British sloops should not visit Jedda more frequently and resume the practice of visiting other Hejazi ports. The naval authorities not unnaturally chafe at the restrictions imposed by the recent practice of confining visits to the limited number of three or four a year, all of which are made at Jedda after giving a few days’ previous notice to the Hejazi Government, but without formally asking for their consent. The Legation feared that any extension to other ports would indispose Ibn Saud, and might lead to controversy as to the propriety of ships continuing to visit Jedda without his express permission. It was also pointed out that any change of practice would raise embarrassing questions in connexion with visits to ports in Asir, both as regards the political significance which might be attached to them and the danger of compromising the negative attitude of His Majesty’s Government in respect of the recent absorption of that country by Ibn Saud. His Majesty’s Government felt unable to endorse an Admiralty suggestion that the consent of the Hejazi Government should be sought on each occasion in the hope that this concession would overcome any objection they might have to a wider range of visits. It was eventually decided in November to maintain the existing practice for four months and to review the situation again at the end of (b) As a result of further consideration of the legal and other issues involved, His Majesty’s Government issued on the 2nd September two sets of revised naval instructions regarding searches for slaves and arms in the Red Sea. These instructions enumerated various treaties relative to slavery and indicated the somewhat meagre conclusions which could be drawn from them regarding the right of search for slaves. They summed up the still pore meagre effects which would ensue from the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, even if it were in foice. So far as the Red Sea is concerned, the principal conclusions of a practical kind embodied in the instructions were briefly these :— (i) Native vessels in the Red Sea might, by custom, be searched for slaves outside the territorial waters of French and Italian colonies, whatever the flag64 flown, but searches in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper, as distinct from Asir, i.e., north of Dahban, should be conducted with great discretion, and should not be made at all in the vicinity of important ports; and care should be taken to avoid giving offence to the French and Italian authorities by undue restraint on dhows legitimately sailing under their colours. It was added that, in view on the one hand of the irritation likely to be caused among Arabs by the extension of refuge to runaway slaves, and on the other hand of the conflict with British principles involved in refusing it, commanding officers should consult British consular or political representatives as soon as possible regarding the action to be taken in cases of asylum being sought on board their ships. (ii) Native vessels in the Red Sea might, by custom, be searched for arms, whatever the flag flown, in the same waters as those defined for slaves and subject to the exercise of similar discretion in the territorial waters of the Hejaz proper; but, in the absence of specific legal sanction for such action, all searches should be ostensibly for slaves and not for arms. The instructions providing in detail for various contingencies as regards confiscation prescribed, inter alia, that, even if suspect arms were found, no further action should be taken in the case of dhows of proved Hejazi or Asiri origin in the waters of the Hejaz proper. Attention was drawn to the existence of special agreements with Italy and Muscat regarding the right of search for arms and to the necessity for not interfering with small vessels armed by Arabian Governments bordering on the Red Sea for the protection of their shipping or for the repression of smuggling. The full text of the instructions under both heads is given in the bi-monthly Jedda report for September and October 1931. (c) His Majesty’s Government came to a conservative conclusion on the question of naval salutes for Hejazi personages. It was laid down in March that the only salutes to be accorded, apart from those given to Royal personages, should be 17 guns for ministerial heads of fighting services, 13 for the Governor of Jedda and 7 for Governors of other ports. The British authorities concerned made little of the possibility that other navies might adopt a less rigid practice on occasion. It is believed in Jedda that the French and Italians are guided less by strict principles than by a desire to give pleasure, an attitude to which Rear-Admiral Deville confessed in conversation with the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops. The whole matter is, however, of very minor practical importance. 201. Owing to the lack of ports on the Nejd coast, no question of formal visits by British warships arises in that part of the Persian Gulf. No matter connected with British naval activities in that sea came to the notice of the Legation in Jedda in 1931, nor was there any apparent repercussion of the Persian Government’s arrangements for developing their naval organisation with Italian assistance. XIII.—Miscellaneous Matters affecting British Interests. (1) General Position of British Subjects. 202. There was no change in 1931 in the situation described in paragraphs 191-194 of the annual report for 1930. No occasion arose for any further definition of the position in regard to capitulatory rights. The Hejaz- Nejd Government undoubtedly consider them as no longer existent, and the Legation has no alternative but to acquiesce for all practical purposes in this view, without, however, expressly admitting it. So far as the ordinary protection of British interests is concerned, the Government regard the intervention of the Legation with a jealous eye. When representations are made, their tendency is to receive them without demur, but to keep any consequential action in the hands of their own authorities. This is seen especially in matters concerning Moslem British subjects or protected persons, and more particularly pilgrims, although there was, perhaps, a somewhat greater readiness on the part of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1931 than in 1930 to recognise the legitimate concern of the Legation with general questions relative to the pilgrims’ temporal affairs. 203. Fortunately, the Legation seldom has to concern itself with litigation in which British subjects are involved. Such lawsuits as arise mostly relate to the family affairs or estates of Moslems. Commercial cases are rare.' There is no65 [7104] f indication that the revival of the Majlis-at-Tujjar (see paragraph 114 of the annual report for 1930) has materially increased the facilities for the settlement of disputes. The Majlis was apparently in being throughout the year, and it was occupied, with nebulous results, with at least one case brought by a British firm. 204. One case arose during the year in which both parties were British subjects, Mr. Philby claiming the reimbursement of a sum of £10 advanced for travelling expenses to a fellow-Briton, who had come to Jedda under contract to take up a post in Sharqieh (Limited), but had decided to throw it up within a day or two of his arrival. The matter was dealt with very sloppily by the administrative authorities, the Legation intervening not so much to procure a settlement of the affair itself as to prevent its being made a ground for detaining the defendant in Jedda. He was allowed to leave on condition of depositing a wardrobe trunk, his only valuable possession, in the hands of a third party, also a British subject, by way of security. The authorities in due course called upon the holder of the trunk to sell it in satisfaction of Mr. Philby’s claim, a proceeding which led His Majesty’s Minister to express the view, subject to the usual caveat against giving legal advice, that the third party could not safely take any action unless the authorities were prepared to certify in writing that their demand was based on something having the effect in Hejazi law of an executory judgment or else asked for the delivery of the trunk, in which case the holder might properly hand it over in submission to an act of sovereign authority. The case then passed out of the ken of the Legation. 205. The Hejazi authorities exercised on several occasions, and with their usual levity as regards procedure, the right of deporting British subjects and protected persons. The Legation adhered to its attitude of not contesting this right, but endeavouring to uphold the principles that British subjects should not be deported until it had been ascertained that the authorities of their alleged country of origin were willing to receive them, and that they should be in possession of or provided with the means of reaching their destination. The most important correspondence in 1931 was that relative to a case which had occurred in the previous year, when, after exchanging views inconclusively with the Legation regarding a British Indian whom they wished to deport and were holding in prison in the meantime, the local authorities dumped him on the Asir coast and left him to find his own way to Kamaran. The man had become a burden on the authorities in that island, who had, after consultation with the Legation, forwarded him to Aden as a destitute. The Legation took this case up with some vigour but got little satisfaction, except that the Hejazi authorities admitted liability for the cost of shipping the man from Kamaran to Aden and refunded it. They considered their liability thereby ended. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Minister was considering the desirability of obtaining a Foreign Office ruling as to the interpretation to be given to earlier instructions stating that a Government deporting a British subject should send him to the nearest point of British territory. He delayed this action, however, pending the receipt of a reply to a despatch which he had written in the summer regarding other difficulties connected with deportation. (2) Nationality. 206. The amendments made in February in the Hejazi Law on Nationality are referred to in paragraph 172 (a). Apart from matters of tribal nationality on the Transjordan frontier, which do not turn on this law, no specific questions of nationality arose with the Hejazi Government in 1931. (3) Protection. 207. No diplomatic question arose in 1931 concerning the various categories of persons regarded by His Majesty’s Government as British-protected persons. As stated in paragraph 52 (6), it was decided not to raise with the Hejazi Government the question of Bahreinis in Hasa. The somewhat similar question of Hadhramis in the Hejaz also remained in abeyance. It is probable that many of them, besides those who make short visits for pilgrimage or other purposes, might be claimed as British-protected persons, but it is the policy of the Legation to concern itself with them as little as possible. Various matters concerning66 persons belonging by origin to the Aden Protectorate, which, in the opinion of the authorities immediately responsible for its administration, includes the Hadhramaut, despite the distinction sometimes made, were discussed in April when the Protectorate Secretary visited Jedda. The conversations led to a satis factory working agreement of a local nature between His Majesty’s Minister and the Resident at Aden regarding minor matters of current interest. It was thought unnecessary and undesirable to trouble His Majesty’s Government with ' ' fundamental issues, which might prove very difficult and which do not at present give rise to practical difficulty. Correspondence passed in 1931 regarding the status of Hadhramis in Egypt, but it was of only indirect interest to the Legation in Jedda, as it related to questions of capitulatory jurisdiction which do not arise in the Hejaz. (4) Mutual Judicial Assistance. « 208. Certain cases arose in 1931 which drew attention to the absence of any regular machinery for co-operation between the Hejazi courts and courts in British territory. Individual cases are dealt with in a more or less haphazard fashion. It is probably best that this should continue, so long as no serious question arises, especially as more often than not the British courts concerned are those administering Moslem law in British dependencies. Some correspondence passed regarding a case pending in the High Court of Zanzibar, in which, after considering various courses in consultation with the Legation, the authorities in Zanzibar forwarded a letter of request to the Hejazi courts with a view to obtaining evidence. The Hejazi Government declined to give effect to the request, but in conditions which suggested that, so far as they have any clear views on such matters at all, they were looking at the matter from the point of view of conflict of jurisdiction, rather than from that of judicial assistance. The matter was of a complicated nature and was still outstanding at the end of the year. 209. The new Hejazi law on the legalisation of documents for use in the Hejaz is mentioned in paragraph 172 (ft). (5) Estates of British Subjects Dying in the Hejaz. 210. On the 16th April His Majesty’s Minister submitted to the Foreign , y Office a report on the question of the disposal of the estates of British subjects, other than pilgrims, dying in the Hejaz. He gave particulars of certain cases* in which the Hejazi authorities had acted, subject to slight variations, on the t general view that the local courts had exclusive jurisdiction in all proceedings up to and including the distribution of any property left by the deceased in the Hejaz and that interested parties elsewhere must apply to or appoint repre sentatives in those courts. It did not appear that exception could be taken to this, but some doubt arose as to the effect of letters Nos. 7 and 8 appended to the Treaty of Jedda. In a despatch dated the 22nd August the Secretary of State reviewed the legal position created by that treaty and the annexed letters. They gave rise to no difficulty as regards the estates of pilgrims. With regard to the question raised by Sir A. Ryan, it was considered by the Foreign Office that the letters were too confused to provide any practical working basis. His Majesty’s Government preferred that no rights should be claimed under the treaty or letters as regards the estates of non-pilgrims. The Legation was instructed that, if the Hejazi Government insisted on their view, it could not be contested. On the other hand, advantage might be taken of any readiness on their part to agree to a shortening of the procedure and to allow the Legation more freedom of action. * (6) Claims against the Hejazi Government. 211. There are fortunately few important claims against the Hejazi i Government with which the Legation has to concern itself. In such cases as arose in 1931 the attitude of the authorities was evasive and unsatisfactory. Some of the claims have been referred to elsewhere, in other connexions, in this report, but it may be useful to sum up briefly the position at the end of the[7104] f 2 aoo 67 year. No progress had been made with the recovery of the money due to the Government of India for arms, &amp;c., supplied to Ibn Saud in 1929, a matter of some £31,500. Early in the year His Majesty’s Minister had, by very strenuous representations, compelled a settlement of the Eastern Telegraph’s cable account up to the end of December 1930, but, despite promises of reform, the account was again in arrear at the end of 1931 to the extent of something like £2,000, an amount not large in itself, but disquieting because of the perpetual difficulty of keeping the Hejazi Government up to scratch and the danger of an inter ruption of the cable service between Jedda and Port Sudan, should the company lose patience. The Government had sought to deny liability for their share in the cost of the MacDonnell investigation (see paragraph 26). The Legation had in February given some support to Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. in connexion with a claim in respect of a financial transaction. During the remainder of the year that firm succeeded by its own careful management in keeping its various undertakings (not including the amount claimed by them as agents for the Egyptian Shell benzine, which is dealt with separately below) within what it considers a reasonably safe figure. They are satisfied if the debit balance does not exceed at any given moment £7,000 or £8,000. Sharqieh (Limited) were understood to be owed large sums by the Government on their own account and/or that of companies like Ford Motors and Standard Oil, but the Legation had no precise information regarding the total amount due, as it is a fixed principle with Mr. Philby not to seek British assistance in business matters. It was known that the items included some £10,000 due to Ford’s for cars lying in Jedda, but not yet delivered to the Government, and some £5,000 due in respect of overdue instalments on the Marconi wireless contract. Finally, the Legation was still endeavouring to secure payment of numerous sums, individually small, but fairly important in the aggregate, due to British and British-protected chauffeurs by the Government and transport companies working under their auspices or those of the Director-General of Finance. It had concerned itself during the year with various other money matters of a kind which do not call for mention under this heading as they arose in the ordinary nature of business contracted with pilgrims and other persons. (7) British Chauffeurs. 212. An account has been given in paragraph 116 of the incident at Mecca in March, when a number of chauffeurs were beaten and imprisoned in consequence of a demonstration provoked by the non-payment of their wages. The affair was of direct concern to the Legation in Jedda, as ten of the men were British or British-protected Sudanese, Somalis, &amp;c. His Majesty’s Minister, who had already drawn Sheikh Yussuf Yasin's attention in February to the grievance of the chauffeurs, took up the case of the beaten men with some energy, though he refrained from taking strictly official action, owing to the difficulty of obtaining precise evidence and the undesirability of aggravating the tension caused by the Transjordan frontier question. He urged that, if the men concerned had behaved foolishly, the original fault lay with the Government, and suggested that, once order had been restored, they should be treated leniently and be given satisfaction as regards their arrears of wages. The King was too incensed to act on this advice. He ordered the men to be deported, and the Governor of Jedda asked the Legation to provide the necessary travelling papers and visas for the ten British chauffeurs involved. His Majesty’s Government, to whom the matter was referred, felt that they could not resist this decision, though Sir A. Ryan was instructed to do what he could in other directions to mitigate its harshness. Fortunately, at this juncture, Fuad Bey Hamza came into the picture, full of anxiety to relieve the strain which had been produced by the Transjordan frontier question. It was agreed with him that the men should appeal to one of the King’s sons to intercede for them. The Legation was not apprised of the precise steps taken, but, in due course, the men were released and a moderate sum of money was given to each. The scandal of the wholesale deportation of British subjects, who, in the first instance, had been the victims of the Government, was thus averted. The majority eventually left the Hejaz of their own accord. The question of chauffeurs’ wages continued, however, to need the attention of the Legation, and, as stated in the preceding paragraph, there were many cases outstanding at the end of the year.68 (8) Egyptian Shell Benzine. 213. This matter has also been referred to incidentally in other connexions. The facts of the case may be summed up briefly. All bulk supplies of petroleum products imported by merchants into Jedda are deposited in a store controlled by the municipal authorities. The Government had not renewed at the end of 1930 the previous contract with Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., the Shell agents, to supply their requirements. Negotiations with other interests for a similar contract broke down in the early part of the year, and in the autumn the first consignment of the special order placed with Soviet Russia in the summer had not yet arrived. In these circumstances, the Government relied on the local market for supplies during the greater part of the year. They had increasing difficulty in inducing Messrs. GelTatly, Hankey and Co., and Sharqieh (Limited), the agents for Egyptian Shell and Standard Oil, respectively, to accommodate them, except on terms of payment in cash. By September, they had neither benzine nor money to buy it with. Their efforts to overcome the reluctance of the two firms to supply it on credit were unsuccessful. The Dutch Bank refused to advance money pending the outcome of the financial negotiations then proceeding. On the 12th September, the bank informed the Director-General of Finance of the failure of those negotiations. The same evening a clean sweep was made of all the benzine in the municipal store. It presently came out that this coup was merely the consummation of a series of thefts effected under the cloak of falsified returns and excuses for preventing the agents from getting access to their stocks for purposes of verification. Including the stocks raided on the night of the 12th September, Egyptian Shell found that they had been robbed to the tune of about £12,000, Standard Oil of about £4,000 worth. 214. The scandal was great. It is uncertain how far other authorities were implicated in the proceedings of Abdullah Suleyman. As a result of protests by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., and the strong intervention of His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, the commercial side of the matter was patched up so far as Egyptian Shell were concerned, by a contract under which the Finance Department undertook to pay the company off on an instalment basis, which promised to be not unfavourable if it were adhered to. This was satisfactory, as far as it went, but it did not do away with the fact that British property, held in trust by the Hejazi authorities, had been arbitrarily appropriated. Mr. Hope Gill followed up his initial action by an official protest made under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, and a request for a formal assurance that such action would not occur again. The Hejazi Government attempted a feeble defence, turning on an attempt to show that the benzine had been taken in accordance with a standing arrangement of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co., and that their proper course, if they had a grievance, was to seek a judicial remedy. A cavalier reply was returned to a further communication from Mr. Hope Gill, forwarding a memorandum, in which Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. rebutted the arguments put forward by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Director-General of Finance. On his return to Jedda in December, His Majesty’s Minister preferred not to pursue this unsatisfactory diplomatic discussion until after the date fixed for the payment of the first instalment provided for in the commercial contract. To complete the record up to the end of the year, it is only necessary to add that no payment was forthcoming at the end of December, and that the scandal, thus restored to its original proportions, became one of the most serious preoccupations of the Legation in 1932. (9) Al Fadhl Bankruptcy 215. This case began before 1931 and was outstanding at the end of the k year. It is of considerable commercial importance, but need only be described in outline. The Al Fadhls are an influential family of Nejdi origin settled in the Hejaz. Various members of the family were concerned in a business carried ^ ^ on in the latter country and in India. The affairs of the firm having become involved they eventually closed down their branches in India, leaving very little in the way of assets and certain liabilities, the most important of which was a debt to the Imperial Bank of Persia in respect of a loan secured on a deposit of pearls. The value of this deposit was alleged to have been grossly overstated.69 goi S3 As the firm and/or its members were all in the Hejaz and had important assets there, the bank were anxious to seek redress in that country. The Legation in Jedda, while considering them the victims of their own imprudence in accepting the pearls without verification, did what it could in circumstances rendered difficult by the lack of proper judicial machinery and the known influence of various members of the A1 Fadhl family. Following on earlier action by Mr. Hope Gill in 1930, His Majesty’s Minister handed a strong, though not official, statement on the subject to Sheikh Yussuf Yasin in February 1931 and mentioned the matter to Ibn Saud himself on the 4th March. Among the reasons for thus taking the matter to the highest quarter were the fact that members of the A1 Fadhl family occupied important official positions, the fact that the firm were believed to have acted as the King’s agents in the past and a suggestion that their difficulties were partly due to the failure of the Hejazi Government to discharge debts due to them, a suggestion which was, however, of doubtful foundation. The King was much concerned to assure Sir A. Ryan that the leading member of the family, who is Vice-President of his Legislative Council, had nothing to do with their business enterprises, but he gave much personal attention to the affair. In due course it was decided to set up a special commission under the presidency of the Governor of Jedda to examine the firm’s position with a view to the liquidation of their affairs. This decision was, with the assistance of the Legation, advertised in India, where bankruptcy proceedings had already been instituted. The work of the special commission was still proceeding at the end of the year. (10) European Cemetery in Jedda. 216. The British Legation remained in charge of this cemetery during 1931, but was unable, owing to pressure of more immediate affairs, to carry out the programme of reform outlined in paragraph 202 of the annual report for 1930. By the end of the year, the matter had become urgent, not only because the condition of the cemetery was as deplorable as ever, but because the proceeds of the last collection made to meet the expenses of upkeep were exhausted. It was hoped to make a more successful effort early in 1932 to place the cemetery on a sound basis. (11) Jedda Club. 217. For reasons which have since lost their force, a disproportionate amount of space was given to this institution in the annual report for 1930. The club continued to exist in theory throughout 1931, a bright example of solvency in these dismal days, rich in trophies, crockery and minor oddments, and the possessor of a boat, which for at least part of the year was reputed seaworthy, but almost completely ineffective for the purposes for which it had been misbegotten, of no interest to the community for which it was supposed to exist and unlegitimated from the point of view of the Hejazi law which had been found to apply. At the end of the year His Majesty’s Minister, convinced that it must be mended or ended, took steps to ascertain the views of the members still in Jedda. They were unanimous in the view that the club served no useful purpose. It only remained to arrange for a formal act of suicide. In order to avoid the necessity for returning to this melancholy subject in the next annual report, it may here be recorded that at a general meeting held in January 1932 it was decided to wind up the club subject to the completion within a stated short period of arrangements to redistribute among the original members the accumulated funds, including the proceeds of sale of various articles of property and to make the silver cups, &amp;c., available for competitions to be organised under the auspices of the interested Legations and the committee of the annual Haj Regatta, as the case might be.70 Appendix No. 1. Treaties and Similar Instruments concluded by Ibn Saud, arranged in Chronological Order. (This list can be regarded as reasonably complete and accurate, except possibly as regards agreements with other Arabian potentates. It may, however, require further revision for the reasons given in the text of the report, paragraph 112. It will be remembered that agreements concluded before 1926 were entered into by Ibn Saud as Sovereign of Nejd and do not necessarily apply to the Hejaz or imply recognition of Ibn Saud’s position as Sovereign of the latter country. The letter H means that the agreement is included in the Hejazi collection of treaties published in 1931.) 1. 1910—A convention of some sort with the Grand Sherif, afterwards King Hussein, regarding Qasim (see “Handbook of Arabia,” vol. I, p. 355). 2. Autumn of 1913.—'Agreement with Turkey following on Ibn Saud’s occupation of Hasa. Defined his relations with the Turkish Empire.

Soviet Russia and the Netherlands are in relations with Hejaz-Nejd, and maintain representatives at Jedda, without having concluded formal treaties with Ibn Saudi Afghanistan, Poland and the United States of America have formally recognised Ibn Saud, without concluding treaties and without establishing missions of their own at Jedda. Italy and Egypt maintain representatives of consular status at Jedda without having concluded treaties with or formally recognised Ibn Saud. 2. Negotiations for a general treaty with Italy were in an advanced stage at the end of 1931. More nebulous negotiations were pending with Egypt and possibly with Soviet Russia. A money order agreement, similar to No. 26, had been negotiated with the postal department of the Government of India, but signed copies had not actually been exchanged. Appendix No. 2. Note by Mr. Vice-Consul G. W. Furlonge on the Import Trade of the Hejaz. There are no industries in the Hejaz; and the local production of food-stuffs is far from sufficient for the needs of the inhabitants. Imports are therefore largely confined to the necessities of life sufficient for a primitive population. Amongst food-stuffs, the chief are : flour, imported from India; rice from Burma, India and Egypt; barley and wheat from Basra and India; dates from Basra; dhall from India and Egypt; sugar, formerly from Java, but now largely supplied from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Belgium and Germany; coffee from72 If East Africa and the Yemen; and tea from China and India. Cotton piece-goo s come from Great Britain, India, Japan, and Italy. The greatest demand is tor plain whites, but the demand for fancies and for artificial silk mixtures is increasing. Artificial silk goods are largely imported from France, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Syria, with some better-class articles from Great Britain. Hosiery and underwear come from Japan; other woollen goods from Great Britain, the United States of America and Germany. An important import is petrol and oil, which was formerly supplied by the Standard Oil Company and Egyptian Shell, but latterly by ^Russia. Motor vehicles, mostly Fords and Chevrolets, with a few Fiats, were formerly imported in large numbers, but the import has practically ceased through general poverty and the restriction of credit facilities by the companies concerned. Hollow-ware and glass-ware come mainly from Czechoslovakia, Germany and India. Timber, chiefly teak, is imported from Java and Malaya. Cement comes from Italy and Germany. British trade with the Hejaz seems to have maintained its position, the increased competition experienced in some lines, e.g., in cotton goods, from Japan, being offset by the depreciation of sterling in the latter half of the year. The position as regards Russian goods is dealt with in paragraph 83 of the text of the report dealing with general relations with the Soviets o 's. /. uTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT 5 0fU Printed for the use of the Foreign Office L-. 1981 CONFIDENT IA1^. (13906) HBJAZ-NEJD. Annual Report, 1930. [E 2485/2485/25] Sir A. Ryan to Mr. A . Henderson.—(Received May 12.) (No. 149.) Sir, Jedda, April 18, 1931. I HAVE the honour to submit herewith my annual report for 1930. It is, I fear, lengthy, As it is the first report of the kind from this post, I have thought it desirable to make it as comprehensive as possible, and to include a certain amount of recent historical matter, in order to make the report more intelligible and possibly more useful for future reference. 2. I spent only about four months of the year in Jedda, and have, therefore, relied greatly on the detailed reports furnished by other heads of the post, more especially Mr. Bond, who was Charge d'Affaires until my arrival in May, and Mr. Hope-Gill, who acted for me during my absence on leave from the 15th August to the 19th December. 3. I have also made many calls on the subordinate members of tlhe Legation. I am particularly indebted to Mr. F. V. Jones, of the Chancery staff, who has performed in arduous conditions most of the necessary searching through archives and the whole of the more mechanical work entailed. Captain B. W.

AS this is the first annual report on the Hejaz-Nejd, it may be well at the outset to glance very briefly at the sequence of events which have made King Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdurrahman A1 Feisal Aal Saud (commonly known as Ibn Saud) the greatest personage in Arabia, and one of the most considerable in the Moslem world. He is descended from that small chieftain of Daraiya, in Nejd, who, towards the middle of the 18th century, embraced the doctrines of the puritan reformer, Muhammad Ibn Adbul-Wahhab, and married the reformer s daughter. This lady, according to one authority, became the ancestress of the Saudian dynasty. The rise and conquests of successive members of the family brought on them the wrath of the Turks, whose main instruments in the early struggles were Mehmed Ali Pasha of Egypt and his sons. The Turks later promoted the growth of the llashidite power at Hail to serve as a counter weight to that of the Sauds. Daraiya had been razed in 1818, and its place taken later by a new capital, Riadh. Eventually, the Sauds were driven out of their principality by the Rashidites. Their fortunes, which had throughout been variable, were at their lowest ebb during the last years of the 19th century. Abdurrahman, the father of Abdul-Aziz, became an exile with his family at the Court of Kowait during the reign of Mubarak as-Sabah. The tide changed when, in 1901, Abdul-Aziz, starting from Kowait, delivered a surprise attack on Riadh and ousted the Rashidite authorities. His father, Abdurrahman, though he long survived, had made way for this enterprising son, and Ibn Sand began to build up his position. 2. Four capital events mark the stages in the growth of Ibn Saud since his coup Riadh. Early in 1914 he sw^ooped on the coastal province of Hasa and, having chosen his moment, took it without effort out of the weak grasp of the I urks, but he w as prudent enough to make a composition with them whereby he theoretically recognised their sovereignty and himself retained all authority m his new dominion. The Great War brought grist to his mill (including a fat subsidy from Great Britain, which continued until March 1924) and havino- at earlier dates stripped the Rashidites of provinces, he in the end disnossessed them completely. They could no longer rely on Turkey, and their ruin was consummated by the fall of Hail towards the end of 192l' He and his had been at loggerheads with the Sherifs of Mecca, and the Wahhabis had held the Holy Cities for nine years or so early in the 19th century. Kino- Hussein of the Hejaz had worked with the Rashidites and used them Ihn Saud after destroying that influence, was free to liquidate his old feud with Hussein He set about this new task after an abortive effort by Great Britain to preserve the balance m Arabia. His forces entered Mecca in October 1924. A year later Medina fell to him after a siege. A fortnight after that event, Ali' who had succeeded his father, Hussein, in the Kingship of the Hejaz and’had been holding Jedda, was forced to abdicate. The Wahhabi conquest of the Heiaz was complete by the end of the year. Finally, in 1930, Ibn Saud established a complete hold, amounting to practical sovereignty, over the reduced principalitv of Asir, whose sovereign, the Tdrisi, had accepted his suzerainty in 1926.[5545] B 2 3. These conquests have enlarged Ibn Baud’s dominions from an isolated principality in the interior of Arabia to an empire extending from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf, and from the confines of Iraq and Transjordan to an indefinite southern boundary, undetermined as between Asir and Yemen, and lost further east in deserts so desolate as almost to serve the purposes of a sea. He owes his success to a personality, a capacity for seizing opportunity, and other qualities such as have conducted other Moslem rulers to greatness in the past, especially when they have been directed by or used religious impulses; and Wahhabism, whether it has directed him or been his instrument, has from the outset provided Ibn Baud, like its other votaries, with all the impetus of a creed at once simple and fanatical. But the success has been achieved in the conditions of a modern world, in which there can be no isolation even for the most fanatical, and no complete escape from the dependence of nations on each other. The Saudian system presents a double problem. Can Ibn Baud so organise his dominions as to sustain them internally and to make them a possible element in a world-system of States? Can he adjust his international relations and adapt' himself to the world system so as to maintain his position as an independent factor in that system ? The problems are inter-related and each of them turns on many considerations. 4. The Hejaz is a poor country with a single industry, most vicious considered in the light of an industry, namely, the pilgrimage. Nejd is not in any sense rich. Except for a few urban centres indifferently civilised, both countries are entirely primitive in administrative and social organisation. The tribal system preserves its ancient features almost intact. Underneath the appearance of unity imposed by a powerful ruler, the old divisions and dissensions subsist. Under an apparent uniformity of religion throughout a great part of the King’s dominions, there survive many differences of religious outlook. The work of giving cohesion to regions so diverse, moulding their inhabitants to some kind of common form, and training them in the ways of peace and modern civilisation, would tax the highest statesmanship over a long period of sustained effort. It would require a strong central administration with trained local administrators; a regular army to be used for police purposes rather than for warfare; a policy of gradual settlement of nomadic and turbulent elements; a steady development of communications; and, above all, a sound, though simple, financial system. Ibn Baud has aspirations in these directions, but he brings to his problems the qualities of a desert sheikh, although he is a sheikh of strong will and great natural intelligence, and is withal a fine man of six foot three, God bless him, as we might say in Ireland. But he has too long been absorbed in the military enterprises necessary to his aggrandise ment, and too hampered by the necessity for constant vigilance to settle down seriously to the task of reorganising what he has won. He is hampered, too, by his dependence on a narrow and intolerant form of Islam, a religion in which he certainly has a sincere belief, even though his Wahhabism be more reasonable than that of the early fanatics. That intolerant creed has been his driving force, and it is a question whether he is willing or able to dispense with it to the extent necessary for the implantation in his dominions of a modern civilisation. 5. Willing, he may be. Ardent Wahhabites already accuse him of having lapsed so far as to be no better than a renegade. He has shown readiness to admit the use of inventions which to the extremists savour of devilry. Motor cars abound. It is told of the King, and the story is symbolically if not actually true, that, in order to convert one of his religious advisers to approval of the telephone, he induced him to put his ear to an instrument which, by previous arrangement, recited into it the first chapter of the Koran. He has signed a contract with the Marconi Company for a considerable wireless installation. He has provided himself with an air force with a British staff. He not only accepts all these things, but he compromises to some extent on matters which may be considered to touch the principles and not merely the prejudices of his creed. He allows himself to be photographed. He tolerates the importation of tobacco. He sends students to be trained in Godless countries. In January 1930 the anniversary of his accession to the Throne of the Hejaz was celebrated in Jedda and Mecca with a pomp reminiscent of similar ceremonies in Constantinople in the days of Abdul-Hamid, despite the criticism of those who considered such a celebrationim-Islamic. In short, the King shows many Europeanising tendencies, and, if it be said that he displays most interest in things that directly or indirectly serve the purposes of war, it cannot be denied that many of them are things useful in peace. 6. Yet when all is said there is little progress to show so far. The human element necessary for a well-ordered Administration hardly exists in the country. The King’s most capable advisers are aliens. His principal experts in foreign affairs are two Syrians; his Minister in ixmdon an Egyptian; the organiser of his embryonic regular army another Syrian, a German-trained officer formerly in the Turkish army. Ibn Saud will employ almost anyone of Arab race, men more intelligent and better educated than his own subjects but too likely in the majority of cases to consider their own interests before his. Except in the air force, he employs no European experts. His attempts to promote and improve agriculture in his dominions have produced little result up to date. He has done little for his roads, nothing for his ports, very little of any real value for public health; something but again not much for education. He is content with a financial system which amounts to little better than putting the money in a stocking when it comes in and taking out as required to meet the cnlls of urgent necessity or prodigality. 7. These are facile reproaches and perhaps ungenerous to a man struggling in a sea of difficulties. The point is that Ibn Saud shows few signs of ability to keep pace with the modern world—and he bestrides a peninsula stretching from a great maritime highway to a sea lying in the line of aerial and telegraphic communications between Europe and the Further East. This brings us to the second problem, that of his international position. 8. It is instructive to note the successive titles assumed by Ibn Saud. After retaking Riadh he was content to be Amir of Nejd and Imam of the Wahhabis. When Feisal became King of Iraq, he was elected Sultan of Nejd and its Depen dencies. In 1926 he became King of the Hejaz “ by the suffrage of its people.” In 1927 he assumed his present title. Contrasting him with King Hussein, who would be nothing less than King of the Arabs, one might infer that Ibn Saud had measured his pretensions by his actual achievements. But, if there be to-day a true Sword of Islam, he is that sword, and, if he himself is content to be the King of two Kingdoms which he holds, many look to him as the instrument chosen to realise the ideal of an Arabian unity. The spirit of enterprise which is his, economic necessity and megalomania may tempt him to further conquests. He has shown an aversion from recognising fixed frontiers when he can avoid it. 9. No power is more concerned in the possibility of further expansion on the part of Ibn Saud than Great Britain. His conquests up to date have brought him in every direction save one into contiguity with countries in which we have an interest. His frontiers march with those of Transjordan, Iraq and Kowait. He is over against Bahrain. The sea of sand which rounds off his dominions to the south is capable of being circumnavigated if not easily traversed, and we may have to reckon with him one day in our relations with the chiefs strung along the sea from Qatr to Hadramaut. Only towards the Yemen can he advance without running into us. He is credited with ambitions in that direction which, if realised to the full, would substitute him for the Imam Yahya as our neighbour at Aden. It would appear to be our interest, as it is in fact our present policy, to respect the independence of which he is increasingly jealous and to recognise that, so long as he lasts, he is an element of stability in an Arabia too prone to chaos; but we should at the same time watch every sign of encroachment on our spheres of influence and seek to confine him within his present limits. 10. “ So long as he lasts,” it has been said. We should beware of counting too confidently on the survival of Ibn Baud’s empire. His power is still the power of the sword. His regime has not yet acquired the cohesion or the momentum necessary to carry it over slack periods. Men, both able and strong, have seldom succeeded able and strong men in his dynasty. He has perhaps divided his favour too equally between his two eldest surviving sons, the elder a less impressive chip of the old block, the younger an already jaded pleasure-seeker. There are other dangers inside the family and still others outside it. The Sherifian family were too long powerful in the Hejaz to make it credible that both of the principal6 property belonging to such rebels should remain in Iraq or Kowait. He further promised to pay as an act of grace £10,000 by way of compensation to Iraq and Kowait tribes in anticipation of a final settlement of claims. 15. The ground having been thus cleared, and various preliminary discus sions having taken place regarding the modalities of the proposed meeting between Ibn Saud and King Feisal, it was agreed that it should take place on board H.M.S. “Lupin ' in the Persian Gulf. Thither repaired King leisal in H.M.S. “ Nearchus,” and Ibn Saud with a suite of 118 in the steamship “Patrick Stewart,” which had been placed at his disposal. They met on the 22nd February aboard H.M.S. “ Lupin,” which had on board His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Bagdad. They parted on the night of the 23rd February. 16. The kissing of the two Kings, monarchs so picturesque and so full of appeal to the sheikh-mania of sophisticated countries, resounded through two hemispheres. Great Britain was greatly applauded in the role of fairy god mother. While the principals and the good fairy, featured by Sir Francis Humphrys, conversed delightfully, though not without a tiff or two, in the saloon of the “Lupin,” the scriveners, their satellites, discussed the details of settle ments in other parts of the ship. Had it been, what it sounds like, the story of a man and a maid, it might have ended in a marriage, and “ they all lived happy ever after.” Unfortunately, it was the story of two naughty boys, a Saud and a Hashimite. They were on their best behaviour with the fairy godmother, although each of them told her behind the other’s back how really naughty the other was. At the parties they conducted themselves like little gentlemen. If Ibn Sand's strenuousness in breaking the ribs of a sheep cooked whole and helping out the stomach to Sir Francis Humphrys contrasted unfavourably with the more refined table manners of Feisal, it could be put down to the fact that he had not had the advantages of an English education. It was not to be inferred that his heart was other than of gold. 17. The question of the desert posts loomed large in the “Lupin ” con versations. There were newer bones of contention. One of the leaders of the 1929 rebellion in Nejd, one Farhan Ibn Mashhur, had escaped into Iraq and surrendered to the police there early in January. Ibn Saud attached capital importance to his being handed back. There were claims and counter-claims in respect of raids. The question of the conclusion of a “ Bon-Voisinage ” Agree ment, one of the proposals mooted in 1928, had been revived. The programme was a full one for two days, even though it had been lightened by not including the question of an extradition treaty, which had previously been linked with “ Bon-Voisinage.” At the end of the conversations the Kings exchanged identic letters addressed by each to his “dear brother,” after a quarrel as to whether they should give each other titles, the use of which on FeisaFs side would have implied a recognition, considered by him premature, of Ibn Sand’s Kingship of the Hejaz. The one agreement expressly stated in these letters was that a further attempt should be made to settle the question of the posts amicably within six months, and that if this failed it should be referred to an arbitral board, to which each side should appoint two members, and the president of which should be nominated by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. In the course of the conversations Feisal promised, in return for an undertaking by Ibn Saud to pardon Ibn Mashhur, that he would not allow him to stay in Iraq and would do his best to induce him to return to Nejd. The position reached as regards claims was not very clear at the time, but apparently a document passed whereby it was left to Feisal to assess them for both sides, notwithstanding the arrangement already recorded that they should be passed upon by a tribunal constituted in accordance with the Bahra Agreement. The Ministers to whom it had been left to draft a Bon-Voisinage Agreement had been unable to complete their task, but it was agreed in principle that such a treaty should be concluded. 18. Ibn Saud summed up the results of the “ Lupin meeting, as he under stood them, in a telegram to Sir F. Humphrys dated the 26th February. Ho referred to the question of his recognition by Feisal and “ the question relating to Ibn Mashhur and others” as matters which he was expecting the High' Commissioner to get settled in accordance with promises made aboard H.M.S. Lupin. He referred also to 'Bon-Voisinage,” to the posts, to the[5545] B 4 7 claims question (as one to be settled in one of the two alternative manners mentioned above) and, ominously as the event proved, to extradition. This had not been mentioned aboard the “ Lupin,’' but had apparently been discussed at a preliminary conference of Ministers at Kowait shortly before the Kings met. 19. Ibn Saud’s Minister’s called at Bagdad on their way home. They found there a moribund Iraqi Ministry. This was afterwards given as a reason why they confined themselves to initialling, not signing, the now completed text of the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Agreement on the 9th March. One matter was, however, really settled, for when the draft was initialled, King Feisal wrote a letter to Ibn Sand, in which he gave him his full kingly title. They continued to correspond throughout the rest of the year, not merely as “ dear brothers,” but as monarchs recognising each other. 20. Apart from this everything went wrong, as the following summary under the various heads mentioned above will show : — (a) Desert Posts. —Nothing further was done to implement the agreement on this point. (b) 'Bon-Voisinage.' —In May Ibn Baud and his Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed their opposite numbers in Bagdad that the King was not prepared to confirm the agreement initialled on the 9th March until an extradition treaty should also have been negotiated. As has been said, the two questions had been linked at an earlier stage, but it had become clear that extradition negotiations were likely to break down over the definition of political offenders. Iraq had always inclined towards the usual European formula excluding them; Ibn Sand had insistently maintained that offences by tribesmen should in no case be considered political. There had been a certain rapproche ment of these extreme views in 1928 under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, but nothing definite had then been arranged, and each side proved to have stiffened in its attitude rather than advanced towards any formula of conciliation. It was therefore a great disappointment, both to His Majesty’s Government and to Iraq, when Ibn Baud made the settle ment of the question a condition sine qua non of the completion of the “ Bon- Voisinage treaty, which, as drafted, would have served many useful purposes, by consolidating the relations between the two States, providing for an exchange of representatives, &amp;c. Laborious negotiations ensued, conducted partly by correspondence between the interested parties and partly by His Majesty’s Government through their Minister at Jedda. In July Ibn Baud was induced to promise grudgingly, and, as he expressly stated, only in deference to the views of His Majesty’s Government, that he would for his part sign the “ Bon- Voisinage ” Agreement and proceed to ratify it, independently of an extradition treaty, if the Iraq Government were prepared to send a representative to Jedda and to empower him not only to sign the “ Bon-Voisinage ” Agreement, but to conduct negotiations for the further treaty. Having given this promise to His Majesty’s Government, the Hejazi Government confirmed it in wilting to Bagdad on the 27th July, but they did their utmost at the same time to extract a preliminary acceptance in general terms of their views regarding political offenders and to obtain a promise from His Majesty’s Government to support them. King Feisal and his Prime Minister had left Bagdad and the negotiations slowed down. It was not until the middle of December that replies were despatched from Bagdad to letters written from Mecca in the summer. Nuri Pasha, the Iraq Prime Minister, about the same time informed Sir F. Humphrys of his readiness to visit Jedda to sign the “ Bon-Voisinage ” treaty and embark on extradition negotiations. He possibly had in mind a greater enterprise, of which he had spoken to the Bagdad press in October, that of promoting a federation of Arab States, which should include Iraq, Transjordan and Hejaz- Nejd. Whatever he had in mind, however, the letter sent to Mecca in December on the subject of political offenders was of such an uncompromising nature as to augur ill for the success of any visit he might make to the Hejaz. The whole question of “ Bon-Voisinage ” was very much in the air at the end of the year. (c) Ibn Mashhur. —The question of the disposal of this wretched individual poisoned every other negotiation with which Ibn Baud could possibly connect it. He became the King Charles’s head of all discussions from February to8 December 1930. He belongs by origin to the Syrian Rualla tribe. He has been variously described in official reports as “an untutored Bedouin youth, and as an upstanding man of 40, with a sense of humour, more intelligence than the average Bedouin and a knowledge of Damascus Arabic. He fears the sea and the air, it would appear, like poison, but he has shown the true condottiere spirit in his desert adventures. He has raided both Iraq and Transjordan from Nejd,^| and he became a leader in the rebellion of 1929 against Ibn Saud. The latter bears him an understandable grudge, and has held that not only Iraq but His Majesty’s Government are responsible for his surrender in virtue of assurances regarding the non-admission of rebels into Iraq and Kowait territory, which were given freely and perhaps without sufficient thought for their form and implications throughout 1929. He appears to have some pull with the Iraqi authorities, who let him go free soon after his surrender and never showed eagerness to expel him into Ibn Baud’s dominions. When at last they were gingered up by British pressure to get rid of him in a manner which would ensure his return to Nejd, the matter was complicated by difficulties as to the route by which he should be shepherded (for he was still a free man) back to the arms of Ibn Saud. The latter was'eager to get him to Jedda, preferably by air. Part-sea routes were considered, but, as has been said, Ibn Mashhur detests all elements except the land. The upshot was a tragi-comedy. Of all the alternatives the worst was chosen. It was agreed by everyone (except Ibn Saud) that Ibn Mashhur should be allowed to proceed via Syria, in reliance on King Feisal’s assurance that he could be relied upon to go on to Jedda, and that he would be personally conducted all the way by one of Feisal’s own men. Ibn Mashhur got as far as Syria and stayed there, He took up with the notorious Nuri Shaalan. The French were not only unwilling to help, but objected to any attempt to persuade their guest, in some sense a Syrian citizen, to leave. He was still in Syria, apparently with a distinct animus manendi, in December. All that King Feisal could do was to write to Ibn Saud protesting the whiteness of his own soul in the matter and the blackness of Ibn Mashhur’s, and promising by way of amends to hand over the faithless fellow’s family and property. The situation was the more embarrassing for His Majesty’s Govern ment because what was meant in regard to property was obscure. The Iraqi Government had themselves seized the greater number of the camels brought in by the rover when he skipped the frontier, on the ground that they had been looted from Iraqi tribes. (d) Claims .—King Feisal, in pursuance of the arrangement made aboard H.M.S. “ Lupin,” and after much trouble had been expended on the question of convoking a tribunal under the Bahra Agreement owing to some misconcep tion of what had been arranged, offered in June to accept £30,000 in settlement of Iraqi claims against Nejd. He intended this to be a lump sum payable on balance, and had reduced his own people’s claims from a total of £70,000 in order that there need be only a one-way settlement. Unfortunately he did not make this clear in his letter to Ibn Saud, who was not slow to take advantage of the omission. He and his advisers replied in effect : “ Fine! It was left to your Majesty to assess both your own claims and ours. You have put yours at £30,000. Will you please now assess the Nejd counter-claims? ” They put in a little bill for £20,500 for these. The same delays that had held up the “ Bon- Voisinage ” business delayed the answer to this communication. At last, in December, King Feisal replied explaining his idea of a one-way settlement by payment of a lump sum of £30,000 in liquidation of everything. There had been two minor complications in this affair, which was still outstanding at the end of December. It will be remembered that in January the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf had extracted from Ibn Saud a promise to pay £10,000 on account in respect of raids from Nejd into Iraq and Kowait. Ibn Saud later tried to evade this promise as not having been absolute. He eventually paid up in July under the strongest British pressure, borrowing the money 1 from the Dutch to hand it to the English; but his Minister for 1 Foreign Affairs when forwarding the cheque referred to it as money payable to Iraq, and in writing direct to Bagdad he repeated the same mistake. Iraq was delighted, and persistently maintained a scandalous claim to the whole amount, £3,000 of which His Majesty’s Government had intended to apportion to Kowait. The Hejazi authorities admitted freely to the Legation in Jedda that the money wasintended for both Iraq and Koweit, but for an obscure reason of amour-yrofi'e they refused to write a further letter in the same sense to Bagdad. The second complication was that Ibn Sand’s bill for £20,500 included a claim for £4,000 in respect of damage done by the Royal Air Force. He left it to Iraq and His Majesty’s Government to settle this between them. It is not uninstructive to '^Niote that the £20,500 claimed by Ibn Sand, plus the £10,000 paid by him under the Biscoe Agreement, made up almost exactly the £30,000 which Feisal was willing to accept. So the tortuous ways of Arab diplomacy lead to perfectly simple equations. 21. The “ Lupin ” Conference was a constructive effort on the part of His Majesty’s Government, ably served by Sir Francis Humphrys, to substitute good sense for bad feeling in the relations between Nejd and Iraq. The above relation of subsequent events shows that the two naughty boys had been too much for all of us up to the end of 1930. Serious raiding had ceased, but they still squabble over the wall. Ibn Saud professed to think that His Majesty’s Government can do what they like with Iraq, and complains bitterly that they shirk their responsibility. Iraq had a complaint in August that Saudi an agents were busy in Iraq territory. So the wrangle goes on. Ibn Saud is probably the more unreasonable, but Iraq does nothing to help by such gestures as the selection of a member of the Hashimite family as Governor of the Southern Desert, and the appointment to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs last October of Dr. Abdullah Damluji Bey, who was employed in the same capacity by Ibn Saud some years ago and ratted on him. If morals need to be drawn from the melancholy story, they are twofold. The misunderstandings which have run through it show that we cannot ever be too precise in the undertakings and assurances we give to people with the exigencies of Shylock and without his business capacity. The consequences of the various delays prove how excellent it is in dealing with Arab Kings, no less than Arab raiders, to apply the motto : “ When you get 'em on the run, keep ’em on the run until you run ’em to earth.” (2) Transjordan. 22. There are no direct political relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Trans jordan. The question of the recognition by the Emir Abdullah of Ibn Saud’s Kingship of the Hejaz, and the recognition by Ibn Saud of Transjordan as an independent State under the Emir, was included in the agenda prescribed in Sir G. Clayton’s instructions when he paid his second visit to Jedda in 1928. This question was not pursued to a conclusion owing to the breakdown of the negotiations regarding the desert posts in Iraq, but Sir G. Clayton conveyed a general intimation to Ibn Saud that the questions of recognition and exchange of representatives as between himself and Iraq and Transjordan respectively were susceptible of solutions favourable to him, if a satisfactory settlement could be arrived at in regard to the posts. 23. No advance having been made since 1928 towards direct relations between Heja_z-Nejd and Transjordan, the brunt of their quarrels still falls entirely on His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. These quarrels are envenomed at least as much as in the case of Iraq by the mutual hatred of Ibn Saud and the Hashimite Emir Abdullah. They turn principally on a frontier situation similar in many respects to that which prevailed on the Nejd- Iraq frontier before 1929; with this difference, that Ibn Saud is or should be in a better position to control the tribes on his own side, and that the nature of the frontier between Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd renders control on the Trans jordan side even more difficult than in the Southern Desert of Iraq. The I ransjordan frontier is bad in every sense. On the east is a line drawn on mathematical principles through the desert, without regard to the distribution of the tribal areas across which it cuts; and so drawn as to make the tempting Wadi Sirhan valley a Nejdi salient projecting into Transjordan territory. For reasons which will be explained in paragraphs 67 and 68 the line to the south of Transjordan is recognised by Ibn Saud as a de facto boundary only. 24. Raiding has been endemic on this frontier ever since it was drawn It is a difficult matter to get the simple Bedouin to understand the political significance of imaginary lines. In so far as he tumbles to it at all, he finds thatthe existence of a political frontier sometimes improves his facilities for retreat and sometimes cramps his ability to play the old game according to the old rules. He is slow to appreciate the greater refinement of the sport, just as our ruder forefathers may have been slow to welcome the introduction of nets and goal-posts and things into their primitive ball games. His backers in high places see more clearly how much grist the new system brings to their political mills, especially if they invoke the old rules or the new according as it suits them. His Majesty’s Government, interposed between the backers rather than between the tribes, have had an infinity of trouble. They have made constant efforts to improve the situation by two methods, viz. : (1) That of reducing ill-feeling by a liquidation of claims in respect of past raids, and (2) that of putting an end to further raiding by suitable measures of prevention and repression and trying to induce Ibn Sand to adopt similar measures. 25. A basis for the first method was provided by the Hadda Agreement negotiated by Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1925. This defined the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd and provided inter alia for tribunals to adjudicate on raids. Attempts to give effect to this judicial procedure failed and the problem (which had been enlarged by the completion of Ibn Saud’s conquest of the Hejaz soon after the conclusion of the Hadda Agreement) was still unsolved at the time of Sir Gilbert Clayton's final negotiations in 1928. As has already been stated elsewhere these negotiations failed of their main object, but they brought to a head a proposal for the settlement of Transjordan frontier claims by arbitration. This broke down in its first form, but led to another arrangement, namely, that His Majesty’s Government should themselves arbitrate, on the understanding that Ibn Saud and the Emir Abdullah should give them carte blanche. The first step towards giving effect to this final proposal was the appointment of an investigator to go into all claims in respect of past raiding on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. The officer chosen for this purpose was Mr. M. S. MacDonnell, a retired Sudan civil servant who had had considerable experience of tribal matters and had later been High Commissioner at Danzig. After many preliminaries, which took up much time, he arrived in Jedda on the 3rd June,' 1930, to confer in the first instance with Ibn Baud. The latter showed a very curious conception of carte blanche and it was only after most difficult negotiations with him and his advisers tha.t a more or less reasonable basis for the investigation was agreed upon. The principal point laid down, subject to a similar agreement being reached with the Emir, were that the Hejazi Government should be represented at the enquiry by an agent and that selected spokesmen should represent the tribes concerned, while the Hejaz Government agent should speak for persons not identified with tribes as such. Mr. MacDonnell in due course arrived at roughly similar arrangements with the Emir Abdullah. 26. It would take too long to describe all the difficulties which dogged the path of Mr. MacDonnell. From the outset Ibn Saud firmly refused to give him access to Nejd territory. After he had chosen Amman as his headquarters, he had to wait weeks for the Hejazi agent, who, after missing two steamers, accomplished the tour de force of going overland to Amman by car, picking up tribal spokesmen on the way. He was most difficult over important points of procedure and they had to be settled by direct negotiations with the Hejazi Government. During the Jedda conversations in June Ihn Saud had airily suggested that all Mr. MacDonnell need do was to go through the Hejazi Govern ment’s files and accept their conclusions, as they had been reached after the fullest enquiry, but the ineptitude of their preparation of their case was proved when their agent had to make 259 corrections in a statement of 248 Hejaz-Nejd claims. The investigation almost broke down over certain personal incidents, in one of which the Hejazi Government complained that their honour had been outraged by insults levelled at their agent by a leading Transjordan sheikh. Other difficulties arose over cases involving the inevitable Ibn Mashhur, with whose past raids from Nejd into Transjordan the Hejazi Government refused to have anything to do in the investigation so long as he remained unsurrendered by Iraq; and cases involving the Beni Atiya tribe, which they refused to accept as being excluded from the investigation by the fact that the principal leaders had crossed into Nejd, unless assurances were given that the return to Trans jordan not only of those leaders, but of other less determinate persons would not be tolerated.11 aq&lt;} y 27. It must not be assumed that there were no faults on the side of Trans jordan or that in those various matters Ibn Saud’s attitude was always unreasonable. There is, however, no doubt that, while repeatedly professing that he was entirely in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, he did everything to ^hamper the investigation and to establish grounds of possible objection to Conclusions based on it. It says much for the tenacity of Mr. MacUonnell that he completed his enquiry in a great final spurt in November, lie left for London on the 17th November to report to His Majesty’s Government. 28. Investigation or no investigation, raiding from both sides of the frontier went on merrily, though with varying intensity, throughout 1930. Each side scores its points by recording protests through His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. One point was happily settled in the course of the MacDonnell enquiry, when agreement was reached on the following formula : “ The present arbitral enquiry shall be regarded as covering all raids committed before the 1st August, 1930, and no claims shall hereafter be submitted in respect of such raids.” This makes it convenient to divide the year into two periods for the purpose of summarising the number of raids alleged by the contending Governments in their protests. For the seven months January to July inclusive, Transjordan complained of nine raids by Nejdis and Hejaz-Nejd of forty raids by Transjordanians. For the months August to December, Transjordan complained of four raids, Hejaz-Nejd of thirteen. The disparity in numbers leaps to the eye. Ibn Sand naturally puts it down to the greater innocence of his own people and the superiority of his measures of control. It may equally well be ascribed to his greater readiness to base protests on imperfect information, to the superiority of Transjordan measures for keeping raiders out and to the lure of the Wadi Sirhan. It must also be remembered that the number of raids does not necessarily indicate their importance, either individually or in the aggregate. The two most considerable raids in the whole series were those conducted from the Nejd side in February by officers deriving their authority from Ibn Saud, one of them being the Governor of Hail. The King at first disavowed these personages, but afterwards more than half condoned their unauthorised action on the ground that the activity of the Transjordan tribes had driven them into punitive expeditions and he always made reservations as to whether the raiders had actually penetrated into Transjordan territory. 29. Whatever the merits of these endless disputes, Ibn Saud’s protests caused His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to review the situation closely in April, and the Minister then about to proceed to Jedda was instructed to go into the whole matter with Ibn Saud; to endeavour as far as possible to get away from the old atmosphere of recrimination; to explain to the King the measures taken on the Transjordan side; to urge him to take corresponding action; to stress the deplorable results of his failure to punish the officers responsible for the great Nejdi raids of February; and to press him to give effect to article 3 of the Hadda Agreement, which provided for direct and constant communication between the jBritish Resident at Amman and the Governor of Wadi Sirhan, but which had never been brought into operation. These instruc tions were carried out at an audience on the 11th June, when an exchange of views took place, unsatisfactory and nebulous, but sufficient, in view inter alia of the hopes founded on the MacDonnell mission, to relax tension for a time. Unluckily, however, there had been a recrudescence of raiding in May which continued during June and July. On receiving news of one particular raid towards the end of the latter month, Ibn Saud went right up into the air and delivered a violent general protest accompanied by assertions that the raids from Transjordan had assumed the character of organised expeditions and by disclaimers of future responsibility. It was not difficult to prove that he was grossly exaggerating the situation, but it was sufficiently serious to force on His Majesty's Government a fresh review and the consideration of further measures on the Transjordan side. 30. The results were embodied in a considered Foreign Office memorandum, drawn up in September and communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 25th October after Treasury sanction had been obtained for the further measures contemplated. This paper reviewed the situation in detail; rebutted many of Ibn Saud’s assertions; insisted on the need for co-operation between the authorities12 on both sides and the desirability of giving effect to article 3 of the Hadda Agreement; refused to admit any disclaimer of future responsibility; and enumerated the measures already taken and now proposed on the Transjordan side. These included :— (1) The continued utilisation of the Bedouin Control Board already in existence. (2) The mechanisation of one company of the Transjordan Frontier horce. (3) The closing to Bedouin of an area between the eastern and southern frontiers of Transjordan and Bair, Jaffar and Tell Shahem. (4) The stationing of armoured car detachments and aircraft at the few water-points in the Southern Desert of Transjordan and intensive reconnaisance work by aircraft. (5) A declaration by the Amir Abdullah as to the punishment of tribes who raided, or instigated raiding, or withheld information about raids. (6) Powers of arrest given to British detachments patrolling the frontier area and stationed at the water-points. (7) The appointment of a British intelligence officer on the establishment of the Arab Legion with powers to ensure respect for the decisions of the Bedouin Control Board, of which he would be a member. (8) The establishment of two advance intelligence posts at Azrak and Imshash (Bir Nam), the stationing of an intelligence detachment in the old Turkish fort near Mudawwara, and their provision with wireless apparatus. 31. Up to the end of the year the British memorandum remained unanswered, except for a petulant interim reply complaining that His Majesty’s Government placed more confidence in the reports of authorities in Transjordan and Iraq than they did in information vouched for by the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs and a sinister semi-justification of Nejdi raids, as being of a retaliatory character, in a note dealing with a particular matter and not directly referring to the memorandum. It was considered best in London that the matter should be pursued orally on the return of His Majesty’s Minister to Jedd.a, but the breakdown of the Hejazi Government’s foreign affairs arrangements (see paragraph 113) made it impossible to take any action in this sense up to the end of December. 32. At the end of the year both sides were in a state of extreme exasperation. Ibn Saud was working up every sort of grievance and was elaborating a theory, which was not new in its elements, but which early in 1931 assumed a shape perhaps more definite than had been given to it before. It was that His Majesty’s Government were not merely shirking their responsibility by their alleged failure to take effective measures to restrain the Transjordan tribes, but were actually contributing to the continuance of raiding by interposing themselves between Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd. The Transjordan tribes, the King contended, were encouraged by the knowledge that he and his tribesmen could not take their own vengeance without embroiling him with Great Britain. He violently resented, moreover, the appointment to the new post created in pursuance of the British memorandum of Captain Glubh, who had been previously employed in the Southern Desert of Iraq and to whose proceedings there Ibn Saud had in the past taken exception. 33. In Transjordan, on the other hand, great resentment had been aroused by a raid from Nejd shortly after the MacDonnell enquiry had begun, a thing which is held to be entirely contrary to the rules of the game as ordinarily observed among tribes and by three large-scale raids in October, which deprived the Howaitat tribe of so many camels that they were said to be in the direst misery at the end of the year. 34. A minor question affecting Nejd and Transjordan is that of certain Druze refugees, who for some time previous to 1930 were settled in Nejd in close vicinity to the Transjordan frontier. An unacceptable application made in 1929 by their leader Sultan Pasha el Atrash for permission to settle in Transjordan raised the question of their disposal, either by an arrangement with Ibn Saud to move them further into Nejd or an alternative arrangement which would enable13 them to settle in Iraq on the invitation of King Feisal. No decision had been taken up to the end of 1930 and no necessity arose during the year for represen tations to Ibn Baud. 35. Only one other matter calls for attention in connexion with the relations •between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan. It may be dismissed briefly as it began before 1930 and made no material progress during the year. In August 1928 the Hejazi Government complained that goods were being imported from Trans jordan into Nejd without being brought to the proper customs posts and paying duty. The ensuing correspondence, which was lengthy and somewhat confused, turned on two things, viz., the refusal by the Hejazi Government of a Transjordan proposal that trade both ways in goods originating in the respective countries should be free and their insistence on the fulness of their rights under article 13 of the Hadda Agreement, which provided inter alia for free transit trade by caravan through Transjordan between Syria and Nejd. That article had been drafted with a view to subsequent arrangements of detail, which have never been made. There was some room for misunderstanding as to its effect and there was further misunderstanding on the British side as to what the Nejd Government were getting at. The latter had been captious throughout and the final reply of His Majesty’s Government, which was delivered on the 20th April, 1930, was brief to the point of obscurity. The main paragraph expressed agreement with the Hejazi Government on a point which the latter had not in fact raised and the last expressed the view that the points of detail raised in the correspondence could “ be more easily dealt with by the Transjordan Government direct.” The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs not unnaturally asked for explanations. This necessitated a re-examination of the whole question, which was still proceeding at the end of December. 35a. No account is given in this section of the questions relative to the Aqaba and Maan district and the Hejaz Railway. Transjordan is materially interested in them, but they are so much matters of high British policy that they can more suitably be dealt with in the section dealing with the general relations between Ibn Baud and the British Empire. (3) Yemen and A sir. 36. It is convenient to deal with these countries together, although the Imam Yahya of Sa'na is the only really independent ruler in Arabia with whom Ibn Baud has to concern himself and Ibn Baud’s relations with Asir can no longer be called foreign. They now present a very close resemblance to the final position between the tiger and the young lady of Riga who went for a ride on him. The ride seems to have begun in 1920 when the then Idrisi ruler of Asir concluded a treaty with Ibn Baud. This treaty does not appear to have been published and little is known of its contents, but the fact that it determined certain frontiers is established by the reference to them in a later published treaty concluded at Mecca in October 1926 between the new Idrisi Seyyid Hasan and Ibn Baud. The latter treaty was made at the end of a period during which the Idrisi was so squeezed between the Imam and Ibn Baud that he had to elect between the suzerainty of one or the other. By the 1926 treaty he placed himself under that of Ibn Baud. It was defined in somewhat ambiguous language, to judge by the available translations, as extending to Asir territory within the frontiers laid down in the earlier agreement in 1920, but it emerged from enquiries made by His Majesty’s agency at Jedda in 1927 that these frontiers had been defined in part only and that no frontier between Asir and Yemen had been indicated. 37. The suzerainty established by Ibn Baud in 1926 preserved in form the sovereignty of the Idrisi. It was, nevertheless, sufficiently stringent to enable Ibn Baud to build up his position in Asir, though he apparently had trouble there not so much with the Idrisi himself as with recalcitrant tribes, e.g., the Masariha inland from Jizan, who would appear to have destroyed or expelled a Saudian garrison and other authorities at Abu Arish in the spring of 1930. That or similar events, whether inspired or not by the Imam Yahya, may have precipi tated Ibn Baud’s great political coup, which was so advertised in November that we can abandon for the moment the recurring phrases “ seems ” and “ would14 i appear.' The Hejazi Government announced that in May 1930 the King had sent a commission to study and report on the administration of Asir in consultation with the Idrisi and his council. After the first commission had reported a second was sent in the autumn. The upshot of the consultations is described in two Green Books—for Mecca now produces Green Books after the approved fashion. Encouraged by his suzerain, the Idrisi had telegraphed on thsiw 9th October inviting Ibn Saud to take charge of the administration and finance ol Asir. Ibn Saud replied, in terms the most pious, accepting the burden. The Idrisi and his council sent a delegation to Mecca with letters describing, with more embroidery but without more precision, the decision which had been taken on the 9th October in consultation with Ibn Sand’s commissioners and which had been telegraphed to Mecca the same day. 38. Ibn Saud lost no time in tackling his task. In a decree issued on the 20th November he approved and supplemented a joint report submitted by his own officials and the delegates from Asir. The Viceroy of the Hejaz was charged with the execution of this decree. The effect of it, combined with the report, was to establish organic rules for the administration of Asir, which may be summarised as follows :— (1) The Idrisi to remain as head of the Government and all orders to be issued in his name on behalf of the King. (2) The King to appoint an Amir to administer the country, supervise improvements, ensure peace and give effect to Sharia law, in accordance with the principle laid down at (1). (3) The Amir to be assisted by a council, consisting of five natives of Asir, all honourable men, to be chosen from among village-dwellers by the tribal chiefs in conjunction with the authorities. (4) The council to be presided over by a representative of the Amir, and its decisions to be approved by the Idrisi as a condition of validity. (5) The council to occupy itself with all matters pertaining to the well-being of the country, both moral and material, subject to its causing no confusion affecting the interests of neighbouring countries and to its having no concern with foreign affairs or having any right to object to action taken by the Amir to enforce Hejaz-Nejd regulations in Bedouin affairs. (6) The King to appoint a Director of Finance to see to the collection of revenue and to expenditure in accordance with an approved budget. (7) All civil and military officers, however appointed, to pay due regard to the position of the Idrisi and to uphold the prestige and honour of him and his family. (8) The council to have the right of appealing to the King or the Viceroy of the Hejaz against any irregularity committed by the Amir or the Director of Finance, subject to the appeal being signed by the Idrisi and to the criticism being true and founded on actual facts. 39. The Hejazi Green Books on Asir were officially communicated to His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda, which, more by accident than by design, did not acknowledge receipt of them. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had not decided up to the end of the year what, if any, attitude they would take up. It may be noted that in 1917 they themselves concluded a treaty with Asir, which superseded an earlier treaty of 1915. By the 1917 treaty His Majesty’s Government undertook to protect the independence and territories of the Idrisi against foreign intervention, an engagement which they subsequently declared not to apply in the event of aggression by an Arabian ruler. The Idrisi agreed on his side not to part with the Farsan Islands or places on his seaboard to any foreign Power. This treaty was made with reference to the circumstances of the Great War. The effect on it of the termination of the war, the further effect of the subsequent arrangements between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud and the position in regard to a previous concession granted to British subjects in the Farsan Islands are all matters of doubt. So far as the two most interested European Powers are concerned, Great Britain gave an undertaking to Italy during the Rome conversations of 1927 not to volunteer recognition of the Treaty of Mecca between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud, to postpone such recognition as long as15 an possible and in any case to withhold recognition of the territorial provisions and implications of the treaty. 40. Ibn Sand’s new arrangements were completed by the appointment of Hammad Ash-Shuwair as Amir of Asir and, it was said, by a strengthening of Ibn Sand’s forces. These dispositions consolidated the practical annexation '^Nof Asir to the Hejaz, and they gave rise to speculation as to the Imam Yahya’s attitude, a speculation all the more natural in view of the indeterminate character of the southern boundary of Asir. There was a recrudescence of the rumours which had been so often current before of impending trouble between Ibn Saud and the Imam. The latter did not show his hand up to the end of 1930, although it was reported from Aden towards the end of the year that he had been discreetly moving forces towards Asir and had caused his tribes to be warned of their obligation to mobilise if called upon. 41. As regards the frontier question, all that can be said is that de facto it abuts on the sea in the neighbourhood of Medi, which place appears to be claimed by both Sovereigns. It has been suggested that when Ibn Saud assumed the suzerainty of Asir in 1926 the reference made in the treaty to frontiers was designed to protect him against any obligation to recover lost territory for the Idrisi. This inference seems to be defeated by the fact that the frontiers referred to had never included a definite frontier between Asir and Yemen. It is quite conceivable that, if Ibn Saud and the Imam fell out, the former might assert a claim to the coastal region as far as Hodeidah, which not so long ago was part of Asir. 42. This brings us to the general relations between the King and the Imam. Like so much in this section, they are obscure. There are no normal political relations, but correspondence appears to pass. Ibn Saud has two motives for a possible forward movement, namely, the attraction of a comparatively rich country which might be a valuable addition to his barren dominions, and his real or assumed religious sympathy with the tribes along and inland from the Yemen coast, who, being Sunnis of the Shafi rite, are uneasy in their allegiance to a Sovereign professing the Zeidi brand of Shiite heresy, ft is doubtful whether these motives would suffice to draw Ibn Saud into an adventure in which he might easily be worsted if he were fighting the Imam on his own ground. On the other hand, he has always been successfully adventurous, and he might be tempted to commit himself at least in the coastal region south of Asir. It was strongly rumoured in the Hejaz in the spring of 1930 that he was preparing to attack the Imam. Some colour was lent to the rumours by the activity of two persons, the notorious Turkish ex-Vali, Mahmoud Nedim Bey, an expert in Yemen affairs, once the friend of the Imam, later a protege of the King; and a less well-known ex-Turkish officer of Syrian and remoter Yemeni origin named Tewfik Sherif. In the summer it was reported that Ibn Saud had relinquished his intention for the time being owing to financial stringency, and the two persons named certainly disappeared from the scene. Later came the Asir coup, but the Imam, who has on his side sometimes been credited with hostile intentions of his own, has not reacted strongly to that provocation. According to an Aden report of the 6th December, the tone of communications addressed to him by Ibn Saud had been friendly. (4) Sheikhdoms in the South and South-East of Arabia. 43. Except where his dominions extend to the confines of the Qatr Peninsula and the adjoining Trucial Coast, Ibn Saud has no direct contact with these principalities, most of which lie beyond the bare desert of the Ruba-al-Khali. There is, indeed, considerable intercourse between the Hejaz and Hadramaut, and there is always a latent question regarding the treatment of Hadramis in the former country, where they are to be found in every variety, from those who are completely settled in Ibn Saud’s territory to those who go to and fro, making short stays in the Hejaz. The question forms part of the general subject of protection, to which further reference will be made in paragraphs 198 and 199 below. The particular case of the Hadramis did not at any time during 1930 come to a head in a form requiring His Majesty’s Government to define an attitude. It cannot therefore be regarded as having been fully explored.16 44. As for the other principalities, all that need be said is that Ibn baud showed no sign during the year of wishing to interfere with the sheikhs in the British sphere, and seems to have respected his undertaking in article 6 of the Jedda Treaty of 1927 “to maintain friendly and peaceful relations • • • • with the Sheikhs of Qatr and the Oman Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” It may be noted here that on th&lt;^^ 4th December, 1927, the British agency at Jedda, acting on instructions issued in consequence of a request which had been addressed by Ibn baud to Sir G. Clayton, communicated to the Hejazi Government the texts of the treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Chiefs, the Sheikh of Qatr and the Sultan of Muscat, as well as those with Asir, Bahrain and Kowait. Ibn Saud was, however, reminded that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast did not rest merely on the agreements which had been concluded, ‘ ‘ but in the custom, consent and long-established relations of all the Persian Gulf chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India.” 45. Although, as has been stated, there has been no aggressive action by Ibn Saud against the principalities now in question, the Sheikh of Qatr expressed to the Political Agent at Bahrain in July 1930 considerable misgiving. He complained that certain of his own relatives were in the habit of appealing against him to the Amir of Hasa, who sent him letters in their favour which he could not disregard owing to his fear of Ibn Saud. He admitted that his present relations with the latter were good, and disclosed confidentially that he, the sheikh, paid the King a secret annual subsidy of a lakh of rupees, but he manifested great apprehension for the future and sought a promise of British protection against Ibn Saud in case of need, failing which he would have “ to seek some other way,” meaning, in the Political Agent’s opinion, some under standing with the King. 46. Wahhabism appears to enlist a good deal of support in the princi palities on the Persian Gulf littoral, and it seems probable that Ibn Saud, while refraining from aggression, takes advantage of this sympathy and the impression he makes on all Arabs to cultivate prestige. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, however, expressed in August 1930 the preliminary view, subject to further enquiry, the results of which were not known in Jedda up to the end of the year, that the apprehensions of the Sheikh of Qatr were somewhat exaggerated. Colonel Biscoe thought it unlikely that Ibn Saud would commit any sort of aggression in view of his preoccupations elsewhere and the improbability of his getting more by active interference than the position of influence and financial advantage which, according to the sheikh’s statement, he already enjoyed. Colonel Biscoe was inclined to think that Wahhabi influence in the Persian Gulf principalities was waning rather than increasing, as Ibn Saud had lost much of his appeal as a spiritual leader, although the fear of his temporal power remained. (5) Bahrain and Kowait. 47. For the present purpose these two sheikhdoms may most conveniently be dealt with in a single section, despite the considerable differences between them. Their peculiar status has been defined for each in the same peculiar terms as being that of an independent Arab State, in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, but not a British protectorate, a convenient, if baffling, formula. Each is restrained by its treaties with Great Britain from free intercourse with other Powers, although the clauses are different in form and substance. Ibn Saud’s treaty obligation in regard to each, under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, is the same, viz., “ to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kowait and Bahrain.” His practical relations with them are not dissimilar, for while he has no normal political relations with either, he is on terms of ostensible personal friendship with the rulers of each, corresponds with them not infrequently, and has in each a commercial agent of sorts. Each of the sheikhdoms has a British Political Agent, and both are within the province of the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Finally, and this is the principal reason for dealing with both together in a report for 1930, the[5545] c 17 questions outstanding between the two sheikhdoms and Ibn Saud, though widely different, have tended to form a synthesis such that any negotiation with a view to their settlement seems likely to embrace questions affecting both. 48. The similarities just noted do not preclude a differentiation. Bahrain ^sis an island State; Kowait a continental one having common frontiers with Iraq and Nejd, the latter determined by one of the agreements reached at Uqair on the 2nd December, 1922. This geographical distinction, supported by the clause in the Treaty of Jedda quoted above, places Bahrain in a stronger position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud, all the more so as it is a natural distributing centre and a good part of the trade with the Hasa Coast passes through it in transit. Only treaty stipulations and British protection secure the frontiers of the Sheikh of Kowait, now much less influential in Arabia than he was in the days of the present sheikh’s grandfather, Mubarak. 48a. The Sheikhs of Bahrain (i.e., the present ruler, Sheikh Hamad, and his father, Sheikh Isa, who was deprived of control in 1923 but allowed to retain the honorary sheikhdom) seem, in spite of their stronger position, to go in mortal terror of Ibn Saud. The latter uses as his unofficial agent in their territory one of the Qusaibis, a family of merchants established in Bahrain and Hasa, who have a strong interest with the King. The Sheikh of Kowait has seen the influence of his house diminish in inverse proportion to the increase of that of Ibn Saud. Not only has the latter established his authority over tribes which formerly acknowledged the paramountcy of Kowait, but he has for many years maintained an embargo on trade between Nejd and Kowait. The sheikh’s resentment is fanned by the reflection that Ibn Saud, in his early days of exile, was befriended by Mubarak, and he bitterly accuses the King of ingratitude to his quondam hosts and protectors. In one respect perhaps the Sheikh of Kowait is in a better position than the Sheikhs of Bahrain; for, when in 1927 His Majesty’s Government communicated to Ibn Saud their Arabian treaties (see paragraph 44 above), they defined separately and in express terms their position vis-a-vis Kowait. 49. The situation outlined above has long existed, but for an under standing of what passed in 1930 it is unnecessary to go further back than May 1929, when the Hejazi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey Hamza, proposed a discussion of certain matters connected with relations in the Persian Gulf, which Ibn Saud wished to get settled. In reply to a request for further information as to what matters the Hejazi Government had in mind, lie specified them in June as follows :— (1) Customs and transit dues collected by the Bahrain Government on goods imported into Nejd. (2) Certain points relating to the nationality and passports of the King’s subjects in the Persian Gulf. (3) The position of the King's agents in Bahrain and Kowait. It may be observed, without going into detail, that under an arrangement made several years before, goods passing through Bahrain in transit for Nejd had been charged a duty of 2 per cent, ad valorem instead of the usual rate of 5 per cent., and it was anticipated that the Sheikhs of Bahrain would strongly resist any further reduction; wFile the Political Resident in the 1 ersian Gulf was himself strongly opposed to any official recognition of the trading agent, who already served Ibn Sand’s interests in Bahrain, lest other countries, and more especially Persia, should claim to have similar representation. As regards the second point in Fuad Bey’s suggested agenda, it was not clear what he was drivino- at, but one of the questions it suggested was whether Ibn Saud would prefer to leave his subjects in Bahrain under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent in accordance with an arrangement made some years before at his instance or n to see the jurisdiction restored to the sheikh. 50. Shortly after the formulation of Fuad Bey’s proposal, His Majesty’s Government had occasion to consider, in connexion with Ibn Sand’s desire for co-operation in repressing the then rebellion in Nejd, the terms on which an honourable settlement of outstanding differences might be arranged between the Sheikh of Kowait and the King. They elicited from the sheikh a statement18 under eight heads of what he desired and what he was prepared to accept. These may be summed up as follows:— (1) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) All trade between Kowait and Nejd to be free. Ibn Sand to be free, if he wished to charge duty on goods from Kowait, to establish posts at four places suggested by the sheikh, these posts to be near watering places in Kowait territory and to be provisioned, duty-free, from Kowait. Manifests of all goods to be sent by hand of the Amir of each caravan and copies to be forwarded monthly to Ibn Sand, who should have the right to punish the Amir in case of discrepancy at destination. All raiders and troops of Ibn Sand to be forbidden entry into Kowait territory. Ibn Saud to have the right to collect Zikat through his officials from Nejdi tribes entering Kowait territory for grazing. Mutual surrender of criminals. iVny complaints by Ibn Baud to be addressed direct to the sheikh and, failing an agreement, to be referred to His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty’s Government to consider whether the time was propitious for taking up the question of the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim tribes, which in the time of Sheikh Mubarak w r ere in the Kowait sphere. 51. It emerged from the then Political Resident’s comments on the sheikh’s proposals that, although Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kowait had agreed at Uqair to have a frontier, neither of them really wanted one, apparently preferring to remain free to secure the adhesion of such tribes as they could dominate; and that, in Colonel Barrett’s opinion, it would not be practical politics to restore the Ajman and Mutair to the sheikh’s orbit, although he might well assert a claim to the Awazim. The Political Resident suggested another point to be added to those on the sheikh’s list, namely, that provision should be made against the possibility of Ibn Baud’s imposing discriminatorv duties on goods imported into Nejd from Kowait. 52. The two sets of desiderata enumerated in paragraphs 49 to 51 above show the general scope which might be given to an attempt to deal with Bahrain and Kowait questions in a comprehensive negotiation, although they were not put forward in connexion with each other, and His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had not up to the end of 1929 taken a decision as to how far they should endorse the proposals of the Sheikh of Kowait. The two sets of questions are not, indeed, necessarily connected with each other, except to this extent, that, as between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud, there mhffit be a better chance of agreement if each side had something to ask and something to concede. It must, however, be admitted as against this that, if it were necessary to buy bettei tieatment for Kowait by making concessions in regard to Bahrain the latter would have a legitimate grievance. o3. When matters had reached the above stage the Nejd revolt of 1929 was at the point of collapse. The hard-pressed rebels were making so free with Kowait territory that His Majesty’s Government were seriously preoccupied lest Ibn Baud should make this a pretext for an attack on Kowait.' This danger did not materialise, but, as ill-luck would have it, the principal rebel leaders escaped into Kowait territory and surrendered to the British authorities there This led m January 1930 to the mission of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to bn Saud which has already been partly dealt with m paragraph 14 above The points settled by Colonel Biscoe m regard to Kowait were these : (1) and (2) The three rebel leaders who had surrendered in Kowait territorv and their followers were to be surrendered to Ibn Saud on his undef- taking to spare their lives and to inflict only punishment “ saturated with the spirit of justice and mercy.” (.!) 1 lie undertaking given by Ibn Saud to prevent raids extended to Kowait as well as to Iraq. J-Ie promised, in the event of future raids to restore unmediately anything plundered from Kowait, in accordance with the custom current between Kowait and Neid and he intimated readiness to enter into an agreement with the sheikh similar to he Bahra Agreement if the sheikh desired this.313 [5545] c 2 19 (4) Ibn Saud agreed to settle claims by Kowait in respect of past raids in accordance with current procedure, subject to the same condition as in the case of Iraq, i.e., that none of the rebel Mutair and Ajman who were in the hands of the British authorities or their property should remain in Iraq or Kowait territory. Finally, Kowait tribes were to receive an unspecified share of the £10,000 to be paid in anticipation of a final settlement of claims—an arrangement which was still held up at the end of the year in the circumstances described in paragraph 20 (d) above. 54. Colonel Biscoe took advantage of his meeting with Ibn Saud to discuss privately the customs question with Kowait, but he found the King uncom promising, and he thought it better to leave the matter over until the effect of more settled conditions could be appreciated. He hoped that under^ such conditions there might be a revival of trade and a relaxation of Ibn Saud’s embargo, and suggested that, if this proved not to be the case, a meeting might be arranged between the King and the sheikh to thresh the matter out with the assistance of a political officer. Thus the Biscoe mission, though it achieved its main object, left the complex of “Persian Gulf Questions’’ intact, with one addition, namely, the proposal that an agreement similar to the Bahra Agreement should be come to between Nejd and Kowait. 55. A few days before the “Lupin” Conference in February Ibn Saud suggested that the Persian Gulf questions which he on his side had raised should be dealt with during the “ Lupin ” meeting. His Majesty’s Government declined to agree to this at such short notice, but expressed readiness to arrange a meeting later between the Political Resident and the King, provided that the latter would in the meantime produce a detailed statement of his desiderata. This elicited a month later, i.e., on the 26th March, a reply from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that “ it was not possible for His Majesty my Lord the King to meet the present Resident in the Persian Gulf about affairs connected with the Persian Gulf.” This surprising reply completely baffled His Majesty’s Government until it was ascertained in May that Ibn Saud had conceived a violent resentment against Colonel Biscoe personally over an incident which had previously attracted no particular attention in British circles. The King, when returning from the “ Lupin ” Conference, had signified his intention of looking- in at Bahrain. Such a visit, ostensibly intended as one of courtesy to his friends the sheikhs, was considered by the Political Resident to be undesirable, partly for political reasons, partly because, so far as Colonel Biscoe knew, no prepara tion had been made for it* The King had not approached him direct, but had signified his wish to the captain of the “ Patrick Stewart.” He sent, not to the King but to the captain, a discouraging message, which Ibn Saud construed as an insult. In circumstances which need not be related in detail, he accomplished his object of visiting Bahrain, but he nursed his grievance against Colonel Biscoe and gave expression to his feelings in the refusal to meet him which has been recorded. 56. This torpedoed for the time any question of a meeting to discuss Ibn Saud’s Persian Gulf desiderata. In the meantime His Majesty’s Government had been considering those of Kowait. In July they decided to approach Ibn Saud with a proposal that he should meet the Political Resident to discuss {a) the Kowait customs question, and (5) the proposed quasi-Bahra Agreement. They attached importance to any such discussion being conducted by Colonel Biscoe, and they hoped that, if the King renewed bis objection to meeting him, explana tions which had been furnished by the Resident regarding the Bahrain affair would overcome the objection. They were prepared to take the risk of Ibn Saud’s again raising the question of his own desiderata in the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Minister at Jed da was on the 2nd August instructed to broach the matter with Ibn Saud on this basis, but it had just come to Sir A. Ryan’s notice that the King’s resentment against Colonel Biscoe was even more bitter than had been supposed. For this and other reasons he asked permission to make an attempt to allay the King’s wrath by a personal lettei which would at the same time serve to draw the King out as regards his attitude towards the two Kowait questions which His Majesty’s Government had decided to take up. This20 permission was given, and Sir A. Ryan wrote a letter which elicited a personal reply from the King, dated the 26th September. He agreed that any resentment he had against Colonel Biscoe might be regarded as washed away, but made it clear that he conceived himself to be forgiving an injury rather than accepting an explanation. The Arab character, he explained, did not admit of rancour, and no one’s action could affect his good relations with His Majesty’s Govern- ment. He had no objection to meeting the Resident, but his impending journey to Nejd was to be for a change of air and of short duration. Should the British Government wish to employ Colonel Biscoe, he would either send a delegation to negotiate with him in the Gulf, or he would engage in negotiations (he did not say in person) if Colonel Biscoe or anyone else were sent to Jedda. The King blandly added that he knew of no important matters relating to Kowait, although Sir A. Ryan had stated in his own personal letter what the two matters were. The most important matters, the King explained, were those connected with the commercial interests of his subjects as regarded Bahrain. He had written to his brother, Sheikh Hamad. If the British Government wished to negotiate in either of the two ways he had suggested, he was ready. 57. The Indian authorities were averse from treating with a delegation, which they feared would have no authority. They were still eager that Colonel Biscoe should negotiate and should negotiate with Ibn Saud himself. The King’s letter might have been taken as closing the personal incident between them, but it was clear from various sources of information that His Majesty was far from being appeased. After further consultations, including a midnight discussion with the Hejazi Minister in London at a club in St. James’s Street, it was decided to make a further attempt to restore really good relations by engineering a personal visit by Colonel Biscoe to the King, when the latter went to Nejd. Various views were held as to the character which should he given to this visit, i.e., whether it should be in the nature of a mission in which the Sheikh of Kowait might take part or should be a visit of courtesy and respects. It was eventually decided to ask Ibn Saud to receive a visit of the latter kind at Riadh or elsewhere m Nejd and to leave it to him to decide whether matters of business should be touched on, not by way of for al negotiations but by way of prelude. Letters embodying this proposal were despatched to Mecca on the 28th December, but the King had left for Riadh a week earlier and it was doubtful whether the proposal would reach him in time for the visit to be arranged, even if he were, in principle, willing to receive it. 58. The upshot, at the end of December, of this tangled tale may be summed up as follows :— (1) Ibn Saud was throughout keen on his own desiderata, which related mainly to Bahrain, but he never defined them in detail and he allowed his pique to stand in the w r ay of discussion on the lines on which His Majesty's Government were willing to discuss them. He made something of a scoop by bringing off this visit to Bahrain in February, but he sustained a rebuff later when he asked in vain for a remission of the 2 per cent, transit duty on rice which he was importing for his troops. (2; His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom, after prolonged consideration, reduced their points for discussion in connexion with Kowait to two, namely, the customs question and the conclusion of a quasi-Bahra Agreement, but their proposal that Colonel Biscoe should negotiate these two questions was never submitted to Ibn Saud other wise than in the personal letter written to the King in August, in wdnch it was brought in as a pendant to the main subject and as a proposal which His Majesty’s Government intended to broach in due course. (3) Despite His Majesty’s Government’s decision in July to pursue the two Kowait questions, the Government of India did not apparently attach so much importance to them as to think that His Majesty’s Govern ment should take the initiative. They suggested that “it would be better tactics to let the other side come forward with proposals for negotiation if the King’s Persian Gulf desiderata are of sufficient weight to compel him to do so.’’ This pronouncement seemed to[5545] c 3 21 ignore a good deal of what had already passed, hut it must he remembered that at no time had the Government of India contemplated negotiations other than personal negotiations between Colonel Biscoe and I bn Baud. (4) During practically the whole year and up to its close the trivial Bahrain incident enveloped in a mist any prospect of serious negotiations, whether initiated by His Majesty’s Government or by Ibn Baud. 59. To complete the picture it may he added that one minor question, that of the treatment of Bahrainis in Jbn Baud’s territory, remained outstanding; and that the main progress made during the latter part of the year was the preparation on the British side of a draft agreement on the lines of the Bahra Agreement, but of more limited scope. The question of the Bahrainis will be explained more fully in another connexion later (see paragraph 199 below). Another question, that of proposed pearling flights between Bahrain and Basra, will he dealt with in the section on aviation. (B )—Relations with Powers outside A rabia. (1) British Empire. (a) His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. HO. So far as Ibn Baud is concerned, Great Britain is the one European Power permanently and continuously concerned with Arabia. Our relations with him therefore run through almost the whole of this report. They turn largely on the questions affecting the Arab countries in regard to which His Majesty’s Government have a special position and are to that extent dealt with in the preceding paragraphs. Various other aspects of them will be dealt with in special sections relative to trade, &amp;c., aviation, the pilgrimage, slavery, the British naval position and miscellaneous matters. HI. As for our general position vis-d-vis Ibn Baud, it may be said that the strain, to which our relations are constantly subjected by the number and delicacy of the questions arising in connexion with Transjordan, Iraq and the Persian Gulf, is eased by his genuine desire to stand well with us. This desire is dictated by reasons of general policy and a lively sense that Great Britain is the one Power that counts politically in the peninsula; perhaps by a sentiment of past connexion; perhaps also by the hope of future favours. The desire co-exists with the suspicion of the western world and fear of encroachment common among Moslems of his type; hut our greatest difficulty arises from the King’s inability to under stand or unwillingness to recognise that His Majesty's Government do not completely control the rulers and Governments with whom they are in special relations, especially in the case of Iraq and Transjordan. Hating the Hashimites as he does, he likes to regard their territories as British dependencies. His dislike of the practical position is intensified by his knowledge that, while his own relations with His Majesty’s Government are in the hands of the Foreign Office, British control, such as it is, over the adjoining countries with which he is at loggerheads is exercised by other Departments, viz., the Colonial Office and the India Office. It is an object of his policy to assert the position that, as an independent monarch, he is only concerned with the department of His Majesty’s Government responsible for foreign affairs, and he hates to think that half the handling of the political questions which concern him lies with other British authorities. This is one of the reasons for his growing reluctance to deal with Great Britain through representatives dependent on the Colonial Office or the Government of India, who, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, are more qualified to deal with questions affecting the eastern side of his dominions than a Minister in Jedda can be. 62. The creation of a British Legation in Jedda in the autumn of 1929 was a feather in the cap of a monarch who wishes above all things to treat on equal terms with other Powers and who had himself suggested the change. His success in this direction was complete when a Minister was actually appointed towards the end of January 1930. By that time he already had at his court a Soviet Minister, but he has little use for Bolsheviks and Russia has no real interests in the Hejaz. Some other Powers had turned their consulates into some-22 what nondescript diplomatic missions and some bode their time. ^ lien a u is Minister arrived in Jedda on the 6th May, Jbn Baud was a made man as regards the international position that he coveted. He tumbled over himsclt in grateiu and very graceful courtesy. He was occupied at the moment with the pilgi image, but as soon as it was over he came specially to Jedda to receive Sir A. Kyan s ^ credentials on the 16th May. There is no doubt that the presence in Jedda ot a British representative of senior rank presents many advantages from our own point of view. Unfortunately they are offset by the failure of the King to produce a Ministry for Foreign Affairs worthy of the name and by the impossibility oi personal access to Ibn Baud himself except on the rare occasions when he visits Jedda. The first of these difficulties will be dealt with in another section. 62 a. Before Sir A. Ryan’s arrival, Ibn Baud had chosen Sheikh Hafiz Wahba to be his own representative in London. This gentleman is an Egyptian and was at one time regarded as anti-British. Since he joined Ibn Baud, his influence would appear to have been used in a sense not unfavourable to His Majesty’s Government. He has been one of the King’s most trusted advisers and it was some time before His Majesty made up his mind to part with him. In July, however, he proceeded to his new post. He presented his letters of credence on the 10th November. 63. No account in a first annual report of the relations between Great Britain and Hejaz-Nejd would be complete without a reference to two questions, one of which, that of the Aqaba and Maan district, was completely in abeyance throughout 1930, while the other, that of the Hejaz Railway, arose only incidentally. They nevertheless remain in the background of our general relations with Ibn Baud. Oddly enough they can best be introduced by an apparently irrelevant interlude on the curious role played in the Hejaz by a private British resident, Mr. H. St. J. B. Philby. This gentleman is a retired member of the Indian Civil Service. Having been employed on special service in Arabia during the Great War, he became in due course British representative in Transjordan. In 1924 he fell violently foul of the Colonial Office and forestalled dismissal by a forced resignation which was followed by his resignation from the Indian Civil Service in 1925. His earlier work in Arabia had taken him to Riadh. He conceived an unlimited admiration for Ibn Baud and he glories, not unjustly, in being able to represent himself as the man who backed the right horse. After breaking with His Majesty’s Government he settled in Jedda and has there combined the functions of managing director of a British firm, Sharqieh, Limited, with the authorship of books on Arabia, the position of correspondent of the “ Near East ” newspaper, the cultivation of Ibn Baud’s friendship and the justification to the outer world of all that monarch’s ways. His influence and his ability have been exaggerated both by those who see in him the power behind the Arabian throne and those who are guileless or anti-British enough to think him a British agent. 64. Mr. Philby’s devotion to Ibn Baud is sincere and as disinterested as it is possible for the attitude of a gentleman concerned with trade in the Hejaz to be. He is supposed in many quarters to use his influence in a definitely anti-British sense and to be a sort of political Fra Diavolo. This view also is exaggerated, but it is certain that he plays a role in Ibn Baud’s entourage, and his activities, even if not expressly directed against Great Britain, do nothing to help, for they at least encourage the King in his frequent stiffness vis-a-vis His Majesty’s Government. In July 1930 Mr. Philby completed a spiritual Odyssey, which had led him through the wilderness of militant atheism, by embracing Wahhabism as a creed. His motives were obscure, but need not be rated too low. He may be regarded as a man wLo has made his religion, negative as such, a matter of political sentiment and quest for further opportunity. To his existing names which included that of St. John he added Abdullah. 65. The really important question is, however, whether Mr. Philby’s change of faith has given him increased influence in political matters. It is not likely to have impressed the King’s other advisers, but it may well have impressed the King himself, and it has certainly enlarged Mr. Philby’s range of action by giving24 in all its details, as the question arose in 1930 only in forms not directly concerning Ibn Sand, but, as it can hardly fail to come up again, the following summary may be useful:— 70. The discussions since 1925 have ranged around the following points . (a) Proposals for the reconditioning of the railway as a whole, and the^ redistribution of the rolling-stock and other material assets. W (b) A general claim, affirmed by the international Moslem Conference, held at Mecca under Ibn Sand’s auspices in 1926, and in various other ways, that the railway, in virtue of its origin and purpose, is the exclusive concern of the Moslem world. (c) A particular claim, affirmed by the Moslem Conference, by Ibn Sand separately and by other parties, that the railway is Wakf, that, as such, it is governed by Moslem religious law, and, more particularly, that the law precludes any partition, such as has resulted de facto from the division among different States of the territory in which it lies. (d) A proposal strongly pressed by the Hejazi Government in 1928 and 1929, that the general question of ownership and status of the railway should be discussed de novo between the Ilritish, French and the Hejazi Government. 71. It is important to keep these four elements distinct, as far as possible; because the reconditioning of the line and distribution of assets are a practical proposition, which might easily he dealt with apart, but which has not appeared to appeal to Ibn Sand since 1928, although he had previously expressed anxiety that the railway should be put into running order throughout; because the Wakf character of the line can in no way be inferred from its admitted quasi-religious character; and because there is no reason to suppose that Ibn Sand, whose effective outlook on things has been increasingly that of a temporal monarch, would welcome any arrangement whereby his own interest in the line was subordinate to that of the Moslem world. In view of the special importance of the contention that the railway is Wakf, it may be added that, so far as is known in Jedda, no definite proof of this has ever been produced. Vague reference has been made to deeds in the Sheikh-ul-Islam’s Department at Constantinople. The only definite text quoted, however, is that of an Ottoman Law of the 1st August, 1914, which placed the railway under the control of the Ministry of Wakfs, but did not purport to, and, in the present writer's opinion, could not of itself make it a Wakf. If the railway had, in fact, been made a Wakf by the necessary specific act of consecration, it would not thereby cease to be the legitimate concern of territorial Governments, however much they might be bound by the recorded wishes of the founder. 72. His Majesty’s Government and the French Government have a clear position. They take their stand on the declaration made by their delegations at Lausanne on the 27th January, 1923, in reply to a Turkish claim that the railway was an appanage of the Caliphate, and on the contention that the ownership of the railway passed from the Ottoman Empire to that of the succession States in whose territories it now lies, a thesis which was affirmed in an arbitral award given by the Swiss jurist, Professor Borel, on the 18th April, 1925, in connexion with the distribution of the Ottoman Public Debt. They have questioned neither the religious purpose of the line nor the desirability of reconditioning it with a special view to the fulfilment of that purpose. It was at their instance that a conference was held at Haifa in August 1928, to consider with this very object various technical questions, viz., the work required to put the line in a state of repair, estimates of the necessary expenditure, the method of covering the expenditure, the organisation of train services, and the eventual allocation to the Hejaz of a certain amount of rolling-stock. 73. Ibn Saud accepted this programme beforehand, but at the outset of the Haifa Confeience his delegates made it impossible to proceed, by insisting that the ownership of the line should be discussed, that the railway was Wakf, and that the sections in Syiia, Palestine and Transjordan should be handed over to Ibn Saud to be administered by a special committee. The effective result of this attitude wa&amp; that the conference broke up, the question of reconditioning the line thioughout was shelved, and a diplomatic correspondence ensued from T916 25 a remonstrance made by the British and French Governments in September 1928. The last paper in this correspondence was a note from the Hejazi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 16th March, 1929, after which the British and French Governments preferred not to pursue the controversy, although Fuad Bey Hamza pressed for an answer later in the year. A 74. In these circumstances, the whole question remained in abeyance throughout 1930, so far as the Hejazi Government were concerned. It arose in three other ways as follows :— {a) The so-called Syro-Palestinian delegation at Geneva has been one of the exponents of Moslem claims. A petition addressed in November 1928 by Shekib Arslan to the League of Nationshaving been turned down by the Permanent Mandates Commission, he and a colleague returned to the charge in November 1929. The second petition was considered in 1930, and was again rejected by the Permanent Mandates Commission, whose decision relied on the Anglo-French declaration at Lausanne, the Borel award, and the commission’s decision of Shekib Arslan's earlier petition. (b) A question arose in 1930 as to certain alleged rights of the railway to exploit mineral deposits in Transjordan. This is mentioned for completeness, but it is outside the scope of the present report. (c) As already stated, Mr. Philby revived the general question in his book on Arabia, published in the autumn of 1930. It need only he added here that, while asserting the general Moslem interest in the railway and its Wakf character, he makes more of the grievance that the Hejaz has never had its share of the material assets. He proposes an elegant solution of this question, combined with that of Aqaba and Maan, namely, that the latter district should be handed over to Ibn Sand, and the material assets of the railway left in Maan station, to be taken over with the territory. (b) Other Imperial Governments. 74a. Ibn Sand has no contacts with the self-governing Dominions. The Government of India are much concerned in all questions affecting him because of his position on the Persian Gulf and his standing in the Moslem world. The only question, however, which need be expressly dealt with in the present section is that arising out of a proposal broached by the Hejazi Government in the autumn of 1930, that they should be allowed to appoint consuls at Bombay and Singapore. This proposal was very unwelcome to the Governments of India and the Straits Settlements. It was feared that the appointment of consuls might be used (1) as a means of harrying pilgrims by means of consular formalities and fees, and (2) as a means of spreading Wahhabi propaganda. It was realised that it might, nevertheless, be difficult to refuse Ibn Sand’s request and suggestions were made as to how the danger to pilgrims might be mitigated by preliminary understandings with the Hejazi Government regarding the limits to be set to the rights and activities of the consuls in connexion with pilgrims. The conflicting considerations were still being examined in London at the end of the year with a view to the preparation of a suitable reply to the proposal. (2) France and Syria. 75. France remains faithful to her undertaking to recognise the predominance of British interests in Arabia and confines herself to her legitimate concerns, such as the maintenance of good general relations with Ibn Sand, the pilgrimage, relations between Hejaz-Nejd and Syria, and an ostensible participa tion in measures for the repression of the slave trade. Although she recognises Ibn Sand, she has not converted her consulate in Jedda into a Legation, but she has made the head of it a Charge d'Affaires. Apart from the official staff, there are no French citizens of European race settled in the Hejaz. 76. The French Charge d’Affaires is a senior officer, w T ho has had a long consular career in Morocco and the Near East. During part of 1930 he was engaged in negotiations for the conclusion of a general treaty with Ibn Sand. These negotiations reached a deadlock in the autumn. It w r as believed at the20 time—and, indeed, the British Legation received confidential injormation in this sense from both sides—that the breakdown was due to Ibn Sand’s refusal to agree to an article similar to article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda, which binds the King “ to co-operate by all means at his disposal with His Britannic Majesty in the suppression of the slave trade.' Subsequent correspondence between the French Embassy in London and the Foreign Office showed that the Hejaz Govern- W ment had also been trying to obtain an undertaking from the French regarding Haramein Wakfs in countries under French authority, and had apparently mis represented the very guarded attitude taken up on this subject by the British Government in 1927. At the end of 1930 the negotiations had not been resumed, but they were still in being and there was a prospect of resumption early in the New Year. In a conversation with Sir A. Ryan early in January the French Charge d’Affaires rather brushed the question of slavery aside and said that the only important question at issue was that of the Hejazi Nationality Law as affecting the nationality of Algerians settled in Medina on the establishment of whose French status the French Government were keen. 77. The French element in the pilgrimage consists of pilgrims from North Africa, other African dependencies, and Syria. Practically all of them are sea-borne. 77a. Relations between Syria and Nejd were the subject of a convention signed at Mecca on the 22nd March, 1926, which was to remain in force for ten years from ratification. It was stated in the press in May 1930 that a revised convention had been signed, but there would appear to have been some mis understanding as the text given in the Italian c ‘Oriente Moderno ” for that month was not substantially different from that of 1926. A member of the French consulate in Jedda informed a British colleague unofficially that there was no new convention, but that the old one was renewed every three months. The position at the end of 1930 appeared to be that the 1926 convention remained in force by way of modus vivendi, but that a new convention was in contemplation. 77b. French participation in such efforts as can be made independently of Ibn Saud to repress the slave trade does not seem to be very effective. Like Great Britain and Italy France maintains sloops in the Red Sea, but the authorities in French Somaliland are accused of indifference and sometimes even of negligence amounting to connivance at the traffic. This subject will be dealt with more fully in the section on slavery. (3) Italy. 78. Ibn Sand showed no signs during 1930 of any revival of the extreme apprehension which he felt in 1927 and 1928 regarding Italian activity in the Red Sea. At that time he was alarmed lest the Italian Government should support the Imam in the event of a conflict between himself and the Yemen, and at least one of his agents waved the scarecrow of an Italian attempt to supplant Great Britain in her predominant position in Arabia. On the other hand the Italian Government were filled with suspicion of the Asir policy of Ibn Saud. In and out of this situation ran the question of the recognition of Ibn Saud by Italy, which went through many vicissitudes in the years' preceding 1930. Early in that year a treaty]^ which would! have conferred the recognition, was in contemplation, but Italian opinion was divided as to whether it should merely be of a general nature or be accompanied by a commercial agreement. The former view would appear to have prevailed and negotiations were initiated through the Italian consul, who, despite the non-recognition of Ibn Saud, is maintained in Jedda. The consul declared his intention of staying in Jedda to see the thiim through, but he was too optimistic. The negotiations broke down over the question of a slavery article similar to article 7 of the British Treaty of Jedda, and the consul went on leave on the 26th September. He returned in December' but the negotiations were still in abeyance at the end of the year. There was no light in Jedda on the Italian reaction to the practical annexation of Asir b Ibn Saud. London heard of the echo of anxious questionings in Rome but it was difficult up to the end of December to take the measure of the situation resulting from the coup; all the more difficult as it is stated in some quarters that Italy has lost much of her interest in the Yemen.27 3R ^70/ 79. Apart from this external question of the Hejaz-Asir-Yemen complex, Italy has few interests in Hejaz-Nejd. Outside the consulate there are but few Italian subjects in dedda. An Italian firm in Egypt maintains an agency at the head of which is an Italianate British subject. An independent business is carried on by a motor-car mechanic and importer of Fiat cars, ^fcho in the autumn followed that other importer of cars, Mr. Philby, into the Islamic fold and now rejoices in the name of Salih Delicata. (4) The Netherlands. 80. Holland has no political interest in Hejaz-Nejd, but is more concerned than any other Power except Great Britain with the pilgrimage, which normally brings very large numbers of pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies to the Holy Places. On the average these are among the more prosperous pilgrims and their national habit is to make a prolonged stay in the Hejaz. Arising out of this pilgrimage connexion, the Dutch have two important commercial establishments in Jedda, each of which has several European employees. It results from this that commercially and as a settled European colony, the Dutch are second only to the British. 81. The Netherlands Government make all their arrangements in Jedda with reference to the pilgrimage. They have an elaborate system whereby their representative and his assistants are specially trained members of their East Indian service, appointed to Jedda for a definite term and overlapping for set periods. In May 1930 they transformed their consulate into a Legation with the existing consul as Charge d’Affaires en litre. The change was purely technical, made without either reluctance or enthusiasm, to bring the Netherlands into line with other Powers which had gratified Ibn Sand's desire for properly accredited diplomatic representatives. It was apparently decided late in 1930 to make the Hejaz-Nejd Minister in London Minister at The Hague also, with a resident Charge d’Affaires to represent him. It was understood early in 1931 that this was held up over questions of finance. (5) Soviet Russia. 82. The U.S.S.R is the only country besides Great Britain which maintains a Minister in the Hejaz. The Minister, Nezir Bey Touracoulov, who had been in Jedda perviously as agent and consul-general, presented his letters of credence to the Emir Feisal, in the King's absence, on the 26th February, 1930. He is a Moslem from Turkestan. The Soviets showed few signs during the year of any special political interest in Hejaz-Nejd, and their principal activity in Arabia appears to be concentrated on the Yemen. Their Minister in Jedda makes no sort of splash. They are sometimes credited with maintaining unofficial connexions in Mecca, and one notorious Indian agitator, who has certainly had a close connexion with them in the past, figures as a religious teacher there. In a conversation with Sir A. Ryan in June, Ibn Saud disavowed any official relationship between the Hejazi Government and this person, and offered either himself to watch him or to allow Sir A. Ryan to take his own measures to do so. There is little or no evidence of any definite policy on the part of the Soviets of tampering with pilgrims. Their ships engaged in the Red Sea trade make Jedda a port of call once a month or so. Jhere is no Russian colony, but the Legation staff includes a doctor, who enjoys some distinction as a bacteriologist, a fact which gives him a certain importance in the little world of Jedda. (6) Germany. 83. Ratifications were exchanged in Cairo on the 6th November, 1930, of a Treaty of Friendship concluded between the Reich and Ibn Saud at the same place on the 26th April, 1929. This treaty provides for the eventual exchange of diplomatic and consular representatives; for the admission of the subjects of each country to the territory of the other in accordance with the principles of international law and “ in conformity with its known necessities,’' most-favoured nation treatment being accorded; and for reciprocal most-fayoured-nation treatment of ships and cargoes and of goods imported for consumption, tranship ment or transit. *28 84. The relations between the two countries amount to little. There are a. small number of German citizens in Jedda. The two of longest standing are men of little account. A third, who arrived in October, is the son of the head of a department of the German Foreign Office. He went into partnership in business with a Tripolitan, who entered Ibn Sand’s service earlier in the year, but apparently fell foul of his employers. It was suggested that, if this Herr d^ Haas succeeded in his venture, he might become official German representative. A fourth German started a general store in Jedda later in the year as represen tative of a Hamburg firm of merchants. (7) Poland. 85. A Polish mission headed by Count Edward Raczynski, a councillor in the Polish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who was accompanied by the Grand Mufti of the small body of Polish Moslems, visited Jedda with somewhat of a flourish at the beginning of May 1930. The count was very fulsome and the King very cordial, when the mission was received on the 3rd May and intimated the recognition of Ibn Saud by Poland. Not a little was said of the Moslem religion and of struggles for freedom. Catholicism and other religions practised in Poland were ignored, but stress was laid on the value of commercial inter course, which appears to have been the main objective of the Poles. They had their reward when at the end of August a Polish vessel, the “ Cracow,” arrived at Jedda with a cargo consisting largely of arms, hut containing also coal, sugar and cement; in all, £80,000 worth of goods, half the price of which was payable, and apparently paid with some little difficulty, on delivery. The King ran over from Taif to inspect his acquisitions, and received a minor military mission which had accompanied the war material. Apart from this, the relations between Hejaz- Nejd and Poland do not amount to much, but there are in Mecca one or two Islamised Poles in Government service. (8) Egypt. 86. The Egyptian Government maintain a consul in Jedda and Ibn Saud has an agent in Cairo. The two countries are not, however, in normal relations owing to the reluctance of the Egyptian Government to accord recognition to the King of the Hejaz. The somewhat strained, though not hostile, relations between the two countries have an historical background, for it cannot he forgotten that in the early 19th century the Pasha of Egypt was the scourge of the Wahhabis; and perhaps a background of jealousy on the part of Ibn Saud, who has taken Egyptians into his service, but dislikes the idea that Egypt is a superior country to his own, as it obviously is. Present quarrels turn on the question of recognition, in which King Fuad’s Caliphate ambitions have been a factor, and on questions relative to the pilgrimage, notably that of the traditional Sacred Caravan, the annual despatch of which to Jedda has been in abeyance for several years. There have also been difficulties in connexion with the Egyptian arrange ments for medical assistance to pilgrims. The medical mission, which is sent annually, encountered, however, less obstruction in 1930 than in the previous year. 87. Successive Egyptian Governments have favoured the establishment of normal relations, but any efforts in this direction would appear to have broken down on the opposition of King Fuad himself, whose aspirations to the Caliphate suffered a severe set-back owing to the extension of Ibn Saud’s power to the Holy Land. In 1930 the Caliphate question had receded into the background of practical politics, and it looked as though the indeterminate situation between Egypt and the Hejaz might he liquidated. The Egyptian consul in Jedda mentioned in June the possibility of a mission being sent from Cairo to negotiate an agreement on all outstanding questions. If there was any definite intention of this kind, its failure may be attributed to political vicissitudes in Egypt and a little, perhaps, to the unfavourable atmosphere created by the action of the international sanitary authorities in Egypt in declaring the pilgrimage infected owing to the discovery of gravely suspicious symptoms of possible cholera among returning pilgrims at Tor. This gave great offence to the Hejaz Government, who had officially declared the pilgrimage clean. (See also paragraphs 98 and 169.)29 88. It was understood later in the year that active steps were being taken to promote an agreement and that the Egyptian consul at Jedda had made definite progress. Hope ran high when he left for Cairo at the end of November after a series of visits to Mecca. He took with him a letter from Ibn Sand to King Fuad, and when he returned on the 25th December it was thought that he had brought reply, but it appeared later that it was only an oral message. The consul was extremely guarded as to the results he had achieved, and created the impression that both the scope and the results of his activity had been exaggerated. On the 29th December the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs denied explicitly in a statement to the press that there had been any negotiations at all or that the Egyptian consul had been instructed to take any action, although the Minister admitted the exchange of communications between the Kings. The conclusion at the end of the year was that there had been much rubbing of sensitive noses but that nothing serious had been accomplished. The people of Jedda and Mecca, who have little stomach for Wahhabism and a passion for gain, would dearly love to see a Sacred Caravan, which they think would give a fillip to a depressed economic situation. At the end of December there seemed to be no prospect of their hopes being gratified in 1931. (9) urkey. 89. The Treaty of Friendship between Turkey and Hejaz-Nejd, which was signed at Mecca on the 3rd August, 1929, was in due course ratified by both parties, and the ratifications were exchanged at Jedda on the 10th December, 1930. The Turkish Government had already in July regularised the position of their “diplomatic representative,’’ Seni Bey, who had previously borne that title without definition of rank, by appointing him Charge d’Affaires at the head of a Legation. He is an amiable Turk of the old school, who has taken kindly to modern ideas. There are no signs of really active political relations between the two countries, nor is Seni Bey the man to create or conduct them, although he has fair intelligence and had a good deal of experience in Arab countries as a Turkish administrative official in old days. The scaremongers, however, occasionally put about tales of deep-laid plots between Ibn Saud and Turkey, and there is a picturesque story of the King’s having had a secret meeting in the desert with the Turkish representative. These rumours are almost certainly devoid of foundation. 90. Reference has been made elsewhere to the activities of another Turk, Mahmoud Nedim Bey, who has at different times played a considerable part in Yemen affairs, and after the armistice worked hard for the Turkish interest in that country. He was at that time in close relation with his own country, and he still draws a salary or a pension from it, but there is no evidence that his more recent activities have been inspired from Angora. Ibn Sand’s entourage includes some other Turks, Kurds and ex-Turkish officers of other origins, but they seem to be nothing more than his paid servants or dependents on his bounty, and in some cases they are persons repugnant to the new regime in Turkey. As against this it may be noted in passing that the Syrian ex-Turkish officer engaged in reorganising Ibn Saud's incipient regular army (see paragraph 133 {c) below) spent some time in Angora as recently as 1927-28 or thereabouts (10) Persia. 91. Ratifications were exchanged at Jedda in June 1930 of the treaty between Persia and Hejaz-Nejd, which was signed at Tehran on the 24th August, 1929. This treaty is of a simple type, but it contains one clause of interest in view of the mutual dislike between Wahhabis and Shiites. By this clause the Hejaz-Nejd Government undertake “ to give Persian pilgrims in every respect the same treatment as they give to other pilgrims, and to allow no difficulty to be created in regard to the ritual ceremonies of the pilgrims to the Kaaba and the discharge of religious obligations by Persian pilgrims.’’ 92. Persia having, like certain other Powers, created a Legation at Jedda, sent thither in April 1930 Mirza Habibullah Khan Hoveida as diplomatic repre sentative and Charge d’Affaires. He went on leave in June and was followed on the 30th July by the junior whom he had left in charge. The Legation remainedBO derelict until the end of the year without any perceptible effect on the diplomatic life of Jedda except the occultation of the least attractive element in it. It does not follow that there is nothing doing between the two countries in regard to one matter of possible common interest, namely, the creation of a new pilgrim route overland by car from a port in the Persian Gulf, which might cut out Bahrain. Ibn Saud despatched a commission to the Hasa coast in September to study thw^ among many other subjects. This alone would not point to an active Persian participation in the scheme, but Habibullah Khan, who went to Tehran some time in the autumn, was stated in the press to have given an interview foreshadowing a further treaty with Hejaz-Nejd. He referred, the report stated, to the new pilgrim route and to a decision of the Persian Government that the transport of pilgrims, which had hitherto been a monopoly of Syrian and Iraqi companies, should be effected through Persian Gulf ports and on by motor car to the Hejaz. The main object of the Persian Government appears to be to cut out Syria, and in 1930 a fair number of Persian pilgrims came to Jedda by Russian steamer from Muhammarah. (11) Afghanistan. 93. Following on the accession of Nadir Khan to the Throne of Afghanistan on the 16th October, 1929, his Foreign Secretary telegraphed the news about the beginning of 1930 to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Government of Hejaz-Nejd and its Dependencies, thus giving full titles. The communication was inspired by the religious connexion and Islamic sympathy between the two countries, and an earnest hope was expressed that the notification would meet with “kind acceptance owing to our mutual wishes and religious bonds.' 94. Since his conquest of the Hejaz, Ibn Saud has been more accustomed to seek recognition than to be asked to accord it. It is evident from what was published in the “ Umm-al-Qura' that Nadir Khan’s request created a pleasurable flutter in Mecca; and in January the Ministry for Foreign Affairs sent a telegram, the material portion of which ran : “In view of the religious bonds and mutual Islamic sentiments between our two countries, His Majesty’s Government have received the news with great pleasure and have instructed me to convey their official recognition of His Majesty Muhammad Nadir Khan as King of Afghanistan.’’ 95. Although Hejaz-Nejd and Afghanistan have established relations by the above exchange of telegrams, there is little or no connexion between them, except that a fair number of Afghans take part in the pilgrimage. The Turkish representative at Jedda is by way of being in charge of Afghan interests, but does not appear to concern himself with them overmuch. It appears, indeed, that the arrangement made under the previous regime was neither renewed nor cancelled on Nadir Khan’s accession, and Seni Bey does not know where he is. In reply to a question by Sir A. Ryan early in 1931 regarding the establishment of relations, he laughed and said he could talk for some hours on the episode. This would appear to indicate that there were certain dessous to the matter, but time has not admitted of further exploration. (C )—Position in regard to the General International System and the League of Nations. 96. The attitude of Hejaz-Nejd towards the general international system is nicely blended of ignorance, a mistrust of European contraptions and a halting desire, in certain cases, to participate, not so much from a wish to collaborate with other Powers as to escape from a situation of real or imagined inferiority. The difficulty of estimating the proportions of those various elements is increased by a personal factor. Ibn Saud prides himself on his knowledge of Bedouin life. His outlook on the rest of the world is that of a shrewd but ill-informed sheikh. Few of his influential advisers can supply his deficiencies in this respect, but one in particular, Fuad Bey Hamza, is a man of ranging mind and considerable knowledge of international affairs. This remarkable young Syrian—he is not more than 32 years of age—has never been outside the Near East, but he has acquired by study and practice as Acting Director for Foreign Affairs a great amount of knowledge. Imbued with Arab national sentiments, he has always71 ^ 31 encouraged the King in chauvinism, but he has also been a modernising influence. Ihe difficulty is to know how far interest displayed in international matters not immediately affecting current affairs is an interest felt by Ibn Saud, who alone counts in the long run, or a personal interest on the part of Fuad Bey, who played a very important role until his health broke down on the 21st December, 1930. ^ 97. Tbn Saud was represented at the Postal Union Congress held in London in June 1929. On the 15th June, 1930, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs notifled to His Majesty's Legation at Jedda the King’s ratification of the seven agreements signed there. He is not a party to the International Telegraph Convention, or apparently a party by ratification or accession to any other general international agreement, though it is difficult to affirm this with certainty in Jedda in the absence of any proper local series of official publications. His attitude will be best illustrated by the following paragraph on matters to which attention was directed in 1930. 98. The Bejaz Government sent a representative in rather peculiar circumstances to the conference held in Paris in 1926 to revise the International Sanitary Convention. His Majesty’s Government procured him an invitation to take part in it. He at first refused, then accepted. Certain points raised by his delegation were taken into account in giving final form to the new convention. In due course the delegate signed, doing so, it must be noted, as representative of the King of the Hejaz only, without reference to the sister kingdom. It would appear that he wished to make at least one reservation, but was restrained from doing so by the consideration that he was not in possession of his full powers, a fact of which the British delegation made use to dissuade him. In this way the Hejaz became a signatory, without reservations, to the convention of 1926. Ibn Saud left it at that for some years. In the summer of 1930, however, at the time of, and perhaps because of, the action of the Alexandria Quarantine Board in declaring the pilgrimage unclean (see paragraphs 87 and 169), he and his advisers became keenly interested in the 1926 convention and considered the question of ratifying it with reservations. It was apparently decided to adopt this course, if possible, quite obviously with the object of placing the Hejaz in a stronger position to resist the control imposed by the convention. It was apparently hoped that the ratification might be linked with an attempt to secure a seat on the Alexandria Board. 99. In the meantime the Hejazi Government had taken steps to ventilate their recent grievance against the Alexandria Board. They sent all the papers bearing on it to the French Government, which passed them to the International Health Office, created under the Rome Convention of 1907. For reasons too technical to be set out here the Health Office was somewhat embarrassed. Its Pilgrimage Commission proceeded on the assumption that the circumstances were exceptional and unlikely to recur. On that assumption, it extended a qualified approval to the emergency action taken by the Quarantine Board, but suggested that on any future similar occasion means might be found, by the use of some such term as “ suspect,” to strike a middle course between accepting the pilgrimage as clean and declaring it infected. There emerged from this episode an unofficial suggestion that Hejaz-Nejd might do well to adhere to the Rome Convention and thereby secure a right to permanent representation in the Paris Health Office. It was decided in December that this suggestion should be brought to the notice of the Hejaz Government by the British Legation in Jedda. This action has not yet been taken up to the end of the year, nor had His Majesty’s Government decided how far they should encourage the Hejazi Government to ratify the 1926 convention with reservations, a matter which is not strictly speaking a British concern, but on which the Hejazi Government hoped to get a lead from His Majesty’s Government. 100. Another convention which not unnaturally creates in the minds of the Hejazi Government an acute inferiority complex is the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925. They expressed in 1929 a desire to adhere to it, again in the hope of escaping from the situation whereby the whole of the Arabian Peninsula is treated as a special zone. Their suspicion that they were being got at was not allayed by an intimation that, as the convention had not come into force, no question of accession by States which had not been originally parties to it could32 yet arise. In and after July 1930 they restated unofficially, but somewhat insistently, their desire to become somehow or other parties to the convention. As usual they looked to His Majesty’s Government lor assistance in the matter, and the attitude to be observed was still under consideration at the end of the year. | 101. The Hejazi Government have not manifested the interest in other general conventions, which they might be expected to show, il they were animated by a real desire to enter the international system, like the convention tor the simplification of customs formalities and the Air Convention, although late in 1930 they asked the Legation in Jedda for a copy of the latter. They, or at least Fuad Bey Hamza, have, however, displayed some little interest m the League of Nations in the following circumstances. 102. Following on conversations in London before he first proceeded to Jedda, but without definite instructions, Sir A. Ryan took soundings in the summer of 1930 as to the attitude of Hejaz-Nejd towards the League. Care was taken to broach the matter in a very general, though encouraging way, and at the same time to hint that the position of Ibn Sand in regard to slavery might create a difficulty. I hat position, which will later be described in detail, is briefly that he reluctantly consented to bind himself by an article in the Treaty of Jedda to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government in measures for the suppression of the slave trade, but, as has been already stated, he has refused to commit himself similarly to the French and Italian Governments; and, while he professes to have taken steps to prevent the trade, he shows no inclination whatsoever to suppress domestic slavery in his dominions. 103. Fuad Bey manifested distinct interest, and in a personal letter which he sent to Sir A. Ryan in England in October, he threw out a very general enquiry as to the position of Hejaz-Nejd as regards the League. Before this letter was received, the subject had been discussed at the foreign Office. It was thought that, apart from the question of the desirability or otherwise of increasing the number of ill-developed States in the League (on which question the balance of opinion was on the whole favourable to the entry of Hejaz-Nejd), the slavery question might constitute so grave an obstacle that it would be unwise for His Majesty’s Government to encourage Ibn Saud to move. 104. There was another issue of a peculiar kind. King Hussein of the Fie jaz became an original party to the Covenant of the League by signing the Treaty of Versailles. Being animated by a spirit of general “ cussedness ” and a peculiar dislike of mandates in Arab countries, he never proceeded further. This gives rise to the question whether Ibn Saud, having succeeded to the Throne of the Hejaz, is in a position to make himself a member of the League by a process of' ratification, and, if so, whether he could bring in both his kingdoms, or whether a new application for membership would be necessary. 105. Fuad Bey’s letter precipitated these various questions, and, as a lead was sought from His Majesty’s Government, they were being considered up to the end of the year. 106. One illustration may be given, although it is not strictly relevant to this section, of the way in which Hejaz-Nejd is hampered in international matters by the rigour of Wahhabi tenets. For some time before 1930 negotia tions had been in progress for the conclusion of Money Order Agreements between the Hejaz and Palestine and India. They were delayed for a long time by I bn Sand’s reluctance to accept a clause providing that interest should be payable by the debtor Administration on balances of account outstanding after a stated lapse of time. In the case of Palestine this difficulty was at last over come by the adoption of a formula providing for percentage “ charges,” which would obviously operate as interest. The Government of India finally waived the point. It must not be supposed that Ibn Saud is always so scrupulous. Provision for interest is made in more ordinary financial agreements. Never theless, it is awkward that in a case like that of the Money Order Agreements, Wahhabism should be an obstacle to normal arrangements.33 [5545] d III.— Internal Affairs. (1) General Situation. ^ 107. This must be a short section. Only the most spectacular events in ,he interior become known with any certainty in Jedda. The country possesses one poor weekly newspaper, which appears and is carefully controlled at Mecca. There is no internal telegraphic service, except for some old Government wireless. There are no rapid means of communication of any kind away from the few main tracks dignified by the name of roads. There are no foreign press correspondents worth mentioning, even on the coast. There are no facilities for Europeans to travel. There are no instructed people except in a few main centres, and not many in these. The rumours of the bazaars are as fantastic as in other oriental countries and less controllable. “ There is trouble in Nejd, ' one hears in Jedda. “ The Ataibah are up and have cut the road to Riadh.” “ A revolt has broken out north of Medina, and the heir apparent has been sent to quell it.' “ The Mutair are loose in the neighbourhood of Hail.” “ Feisal-ad-Dawish is dead.' “ Feisal-ad-Dawish has escaped.” “ The King’s brother, the Amir Muhammad, has gone against him and liberated all the political prisoners at Riadh.' 108. All that can be said is that in 1930 there were no spectacular events from the middle of January up to the end of the year. The rebellion of 1929, to which reference has already been made, had practically collapsed by the end of that year. The surrender of the principal leaders in Iraq and Kowait on and before the 9th January marked the end of it. Ibn Baud vas still personally conducting operations on his own side of the Kowait frontier at that time. Just before the 12th January he destroyed two parties of rebels, one under a certain Ibn Ashwan, who had been of some consequence among the Mutair tribe. These were the last recorded incidents of a warlike character. Up to the end of December, despite rumours of the kind described above, there was no sign of any situation with which the King could not deal without organising fresh expeditions. 109. Ibn Baud’s rule is not popular in places like Mecca and Jedda, but it is uneasily tolerated. Early in the year comment was excited by the visit to Mecca of one Abdullah-bin-Blaihid, who had been appointed by the King in 1925 to be Grand Mufti of the Hejaz, but who was relegated in 1927 to the post of Qadi of Hail. He is said to be an outspoken man, and his visit to Mecca was reported to be embarrassing to the Government. They have little to fear from townsmen, however. These are not of the stuff of which revolutionaries are made, and, in any case, they enjoy a curious freedom under the autocracy of Ibn Baud. Now and then attempts are made to impose a more serious observance of Wahhabite principles. A drive was made in this direction early in 1930, when special policemen from Nejd were imported to enforce regulations drawn up by Committees of Public Virtue of a sort. They raged against music, laxity in attendance at mosque, public smoking, &amp;c. It was suggested that this activity was due to a desire to propitiate unco’guid chieftains who were expected to arrive from Nejd or to impress pilgrims, and it was thought that the naturally easy-going inhabitants of Jedda would have to put up with it for some time. From May onwards, however, little was heard of extreme measures. During the summer of 1930 Jedda Gaol, a picturesque ruin opposite the British Legation, was a conspicuous centre of evening merriment. It was not known whether the warders or the prisoners were concerned in the revels or whether they were the result of a combined effort. 110. It would be easy but useless to prolong this chronicle of small beer. Anything of importance that was known of the internal situation in 1930 can be summed up in a few r sentences. After his conquest of the rebels, Ibn Baud dominated the tribal situation everywhere. The tribes which had been in revolt were cowed rather than loyal, and these included the Ataibah, who bestride the road between the two capitals. There were no evidences of serious insecurity, and it is due to the King to say that the more accessible regions, e.g., the country round Jedda and up to Medina, have, under his regime, been made safer than they w r ere in old days, wdien it was a dangerous adventure to go more than a mile outside the walls of Jedda. Accurate news of what passed in the interior of Nejd34 was impossible to come by during the year. In the towns of the Hejaz there was a latent struggle between a certain tendency towards Nejdification ” and the passive resistance of the Hejazi. Passive resistance seems to have had the best of it on the whole, but the Nejdi penetration scored its points from time to time, as when the little boys of Jedda were deprived of their mouth organs and their elders driven into the mosques, when the gates of the enclosure which formerl'-N. contained Eve's tomb, were built up in the spring, or when, towards the end 01 the year, it was made a Government order that all officials should wear the picturesque Bedouin headdress, previously little used in Hejazi towns. There has also been a tendency to increase the Nejdi element in the Administration, and it will be noted in the section dealing with the pilgrimage that, while the attendance from the interior of Arabia was small, the number of Nejdi officials, &amp;e., who came to Mecca on Haj in 1930 was considerable. The proposal mooted by the statesman of Mecca in the autumn, but not followed up, that marriage should be made compulsory, was perhaps a subtler move in the direction of “ Nejdification,” for it is said to have been accompanied by a suggestion that the bachelors of the Hejaz could supply any local deficiency of brides by importing maidens from the sister kingdom. (2) A dministration. 111. The Hejaz and Nejd and its Dependencies are, in theory, two separate kingdoms, joined in a personal union. A concept so Western is necessarily some what unreal in Arabia, but it finds expression in one fact, namely, that the Hejaz has a Constitution, promulgated in 1926, whereas the other kingdom is governed like a sheikhdom or congeries of sheikhdoms. Neither country appears to possess a national flag as distinct from the Royal Standard, which consists of a green ground embroidered with the profession of faith and a sword beneath, the whole flanked by a broad white band on the flagstaff side. Incidental mention was made to His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires early in 1930, when he was trying to recover money due to the Government of India, of there being two Treasuries, but when Sir A. Ryan adverted to this early in 1931 he was told that by the King’s order they had been merged. 112. The Hejaz Constitution is in any case of an elementary type. All authority is vested in the King, who is bound by the religious law. Certain powers, extensive on paper, are delegated to the Viceroy of the Hejaz, who was before and throughout 1930 the King’s second surviving son, the Emir Feisal, and to six departments of State. The King himself, however, retains control of the departments concerned with military and foreign affairs, except in the latter case as regards administrative and consular matters. Provision is made for various councils and other administrative machinery, including an advisory legislative council and municipal bodies. It is to be hoped, though it cannot be said with certainty, that this administrative machine works better in other directions than it does in the case of finance and foreign affairs. Finance, such as it is, is completely in the hands of a certain Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who began life m a humble capacity in the service of the Qusaibi family of Persian Gulf merchants, but rose rapidly after passing into that of the King. He would appear to be a capable till-manager and he has handled his personal finances with no little skill. Foreign affairs were also a one-man show throughout nearly the whole of 1930, for, except in so tar as they were controlled bv the King and other members of his entourage, they were in the hands of Fuad Bey Hamza the Syrian mentioned in paragraph 96 above. The system created much difficulty for the foreign representatives in Jedda. The headquarters of the Ministry were in Mecca, and the four representatives who are Moslems could obtain occasional access to it there. The other four, who are non-Moslems, had to do what they could by correspondence or using an imperfect telephone system, and to reserve business requiring oral discussion for the rare visits of Fuad Bev or the still rarer visits of the King to Jedda. 113. The situation gave rise to much complaint, and in December, after long cogitation, a reform was instituted. The Directorate of Foreten Affairs was elevated to a Ministry, with the Emir Feisal, already Viceroy of the Heiaz as Minister and Fuad Bey, who had been acting “ Director,” as Under-Secretary35 of State. When this scheme was first mooted, it was suggested that the King wished for reasons of health to rid himself of some of his responsibilities and that the Emir would act as his delegate for foreign affairs, while Fuad Bey would continue to do the ministerial work. It was understood that there was to be a permanent branch of the Ministry at Jedda, in which Fuad Bey would ^Npend much of his time. The plan broke down owing to the sudden and serious illness of Fuad Bey, less than a week after the new arrangements came into force on the 16th December. Up to the end of the year foreign affairs were practically unattended to. 114. The King took advantage of his prolonged stay in the Hejaz in 1930 to give attention to other administrative matters. His attempts to reorganise his finances, if made, would appear to have been a failure up to the end of the year. Various new appointments were made in the customs and other depart ments. A new Pilgrimage Committee was appointed. A former Hejazi institution, the Majlis-at-Tujjar, something between a chamber of commerce and a special tribunal to deal with commercial disputes, was revived, but had not got to work before the end of December. An Inspectorate of Government Depart ments was created. Nejd was not neglected, for a commission headed by a well- known Jeddawi, Mohammed-at-Tawil, was sent to the Hasa Coast to report and reorganise. This body seems to have displayed some energy. At any rate it indisposed the Qusaibi family, who have great interests in the Persian Gulf and are employed by Ibn Sand as money-lenders and for other purposes, by abolishing certain abuses by which they had profited. 115. The various achievements of the Government during the previous year were enumerated in an article in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” newspaper on the 3rd October. This list, though meagre enough, is of sufficient interest to be reproduced in extenso in the second appendix to this report. The principal administrative measures enumerated in it, in addition to those mentioned in the preceding paragraph or elswhere in special connexions, are the renewal of the mandate of the Legislative Council and a reorganisation of the police system. 116. Lack of complete information makes it more difficult to describe the administrative system of the two countries as a whole. The tribal sheikhs retain much power, but in certain places Ibn Sand has representatives who may be regarded more in the light of officials in an European sense. Thus El-Hasa is held and strongly held by the Amir, Abdullah Ibn Jiluwi, who is a relative of Ibn Saud. The King’s eldest son, the Amir Saud 1 , has a position at Riadh, comparable to that of the Viceroy of the Ilejaz. The towns have Governors of different types. The Governor of Jedda, for instance, is the head of the principal native firm of shipping agents. The variety of administrative system is doubtless suited to the conditions of the country, but does not provide the uniformity and centralisation (except in so far as there is centralisation in the King’s person) which would be necessary, if it were desired to organise the two kingdoms as a whole on modern lines. IV.— Financial, Economic and Commercial Situation. 117. It is hardly necessary to say that neither the Hejaz nor Nejd has any public budget. No accurate idea can be formed of the revenue from customs, the pilgrimage and other sources; or of the expenditure on administration, military enterprise and equipment and the important item of doles to the tribes. It has already been explained that all central finance is in the hands of one man, Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman. He lives from hand to mouth, collecting what he can and meeting or evading liabilities as best he can. Ibn Saud is poor and spend thrift. It can be said with certainty that the financial situation grew steadily worse during 1930. At the beginning of August the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, when pleading for delay in enforcing a payment, assured Sir A. Ryan that the King was going into the situation seriously and that an improvement might be looked for in a few months. The position at the end of December, however, was worse than in the summer. [5545] d 236 118. The claim just mentioned was lor the value of arms and ammunition to the value of some £31,500 supplied by the Government oi India in 19!29, as a matter of urgency and without a commercial agreement, in order to assist the King to cope with his rebels. A settlement had frequently been pressed tor. When the matter was again taken up in the summer, Ibn Sand had been induced to promise payment of the £10,000 due under the Biscoe agreement of January This money was procured by borrowing from the Dutch Bank in Jedda and Fuad Bey begged ad misericordiam for a postponement of the Indian claim on grounds of financial stringency and on the strength of the assurance mentioned above. This delay was accorded, but a letter agreeing to it, if a firm undertaking could be given that the payment would be completed by the 28th February, 1931, remained unanswered. Tire Eastern Telegraph Company had similar difficulty in obtaining settlement of their cable account with the Government, and at the end of the year they were owed about £5,000 for a period of eight months, although their agreement provides for a monthly settlement. Messrs. Gellatly Hankey and Company, Limited, had constant trouble over the settlement of outstanding debts. At the end of the year they were owed on various accounts nearly £13,000 plus £17,000, of which payment had been made and accepted in the form of drafts on the customs, drafts which could only be realised on the market at a heavy loss, but which could be worked off gradually by tendering them in payment of duty on imported goods. 119. The position in regard to these British claims is an index of the genei al financial situation. By the end of the year the King was similarly indebted to the Dutch. He was said to owe the Qusaibi family in the Persian Gulf about £80,000, and to be heavily indebted to the rich Governor of Jedda also. On the other hand, when it is necessary to pay on the nail, Abdullah Suleiman contrives to produce the money, as in the case of the £40,000 paid for the Cracow cargo at the end of August (see paragraph 85). 120. None of the sums mentioned are spectacular for a Government. The evil feature of the situation is that dealings so comparatively small already necessitate all the shifts which are so familiar in the history of oriental finance. Drafts on customs are issued so freely as to have become unrealisable in cash except at a heavy discount. Financial stringency was aggravated at the end of the year by the prospect of a poor pilgrimage in 1931, and the revenue which was expected to accrue from it would appear to have been discounted in a sense before the end of December by the device of hurrying the first arrivals of pilgrims, mostly Javanese, who come early, through to Medina, in order to obtain payment of the heavy tax imposed on those who include that place in the pilgrimage. Official salaries were heavily in arrear at the end of the year. Government money was so short that even the wages of chauffeurs could not be paid, and as a good many of them are Sudanese and Somalis, this became a matter of concern to the British Legation. 121. Another of the difficulties which beset the Government was that of maintaining, even approximately, the balance of the silver currency, which is supposed to be fixed at the rate of 10 riyals to the gold standard of currency, which is the English sovereign. This, however, did not become acute until earlv in 1931. ^ 122. It is impossible to say whether, in the conditions of the country, the financial situation could be completely restored by better management or not. So far as the Hejaz is concerned, the writer of the “Survey of Internationai Affairs ” for 1925 (Volume I, p. 289) suggests that it is almost indispensible that the profit of the pilgrim trade should he supplemented by some subsidy. On the other hand, the manager of the Dutch Bank in Jedda'told Sir A. Ryan early in 1931, and he was speaking not as an optimist, but as one suffering'from the general difficulty of getting money from the Government, that it should be possible to produce a balanced budget. He put the total of the floating debt at not more than £500,000, and, according to his information, the budget figures in 1926 had been : Revenue £3,437,862; expenditure £3,300,314. Out of the latter amount £1,919,141 was stated to be for the use of the King, a term which would probably cover his subsidies to the tribes. None of the figures can be Guaranteed nor is it clear whether they are for the Hejaz only or for the whole oAbn Saud’s37 QQoL territories. If they have any value at all, it is as an indication that the Govern ment of the country, unhampered as they are by any funded debt, ought to be able to make a better hand of their affairs. 123. It is equally impossible to determine what the economic possibilities &gt;^)f Ibn Sand’s dominions are or might be. The reasons given for the jejune character of the section on internal affairs apply in this case with even greater force. The present position of the Hej^z is clear. It is almost entirely dependent on the pilgrimage, its only important industry. There are some fertile areas like the Valley of Wady Fatma, near Mecca and Taif, and the neighbourhood of Medina. The official list of recent advances (see para graph 115) mentions the publication at Government expense of a work on 14 National Agriculture ’’ by a landowner of Medina. This pamphlet describes the Medina region as an area so fertile that in old days it exported annually to Syria 100,000 loads of wheat, &amp;c. The writer attributes the subsequent decline to slackness and lack of that security which Ibn Saud has now restored, with the result that people have begun again to cultivate their land. He describes in his Georgic the operations proper to the periods corresponding to the signs of the Zodiac and gives a general account of the crops produced, but he supplies no precise or statistical information. 124. Nothing can be ascertained, at any rate in Jedda, about the real economic situation in, much less the potentialities of, Nejd. Stress is laid by certain writers on the agricultural side of the system of land settlement which Ibn Saud brought into operation in or about 1910, when he initiated the system of colonies of Akwan or brethren, who played so large a part in his subsequent enterprises. From the accounts given of them, however, it is clear that agriculture was merely ancillary to the object of creating a, military organisation of tribesmen, who, thus settled, could be more easily disciplined and mobilised, and whose zeal could be inflamed by inculcating the purest principles of Wahhabism. The most precise account is that given by Ameen Rihani in his “ Ibn Saud of Arabia,” published in 1927. He gives a nominal list of sixty-one settlements, and puts the total number at about seventy, without indicating the source of his information. He emphasises the agricultural side of the scheme, but little appears to be known of its success in that direction. Mr. Philby in his latest book, published in 1930, refers also to the agricultural character of the colonies, but he does little more than eulogise Ibn Saud and echo a little more cautiously Mr. Rihani. 125. Lack of water must obviously be the greatest obstacle to any serious agricultural development in the greater part of Ibn Saud s dominions. It is possible that it might be overcome to some extent by the use of artesian wells and devises for tapping underground watercourses in certain regions. It is stated in the list of Government achievements mentioned in paragraph 115 that they included the importation of modern pumping machinery, the success of which had encouraged private persons to order similar plant. It does not appear that up to the end of 1930 anything important had been done in the direction of finding or raising new water. The King would appear to be interested in the subject, probably too vaguely and unintelligently. Particular mention may be made of an inchoate scheme of an ambitious nature to bore for watei at Ras Tanura at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Bahrain, with a view to the creation of a port there. 126. One also hears the talk of possible mineral wealth, common in con nexion with unexplored and undeveloped countries. There is, so far as the author of this report knows, nothing to substantiate it, unless it be the fact, stated elsewhere, that certain American oil companies thought it worth while early in 1930 to explore the possibility of organising an aerial geological survey of the Hasa littoral. The poverty of the Sudan in mineral resources may perhaps be taken as an indication that they are unlikely to prove considerable in similar areas on the other side of the Red Sea. 127. No commercial statistics are available, although late in 1930 the Hejazi Ministry for Foreign Affairs informed the British Legation that steps were being taken to produce them. No survey of the trade of Nejd is at present possible in Jedda. So far as the Hejaz is concerned, all that can be said is that [5545] D 3mem 38 it depends on importation for nearly all supplies, and that its requirements are of a simple nature in the main. The bulk of the trade passes through Jedda. Little is done in the more modern lines of trade, unless it be motor cars, which are bought in disproportionately large numbers, as they are quickly ruined by bad roads and incompetent handling. 1*28. Some idea of the importance of Jedda, the principal port for the^ pilgrimage and general commerce, may be derived from the following summary of the statistics of ships in foreign trade for 1930 :— Entered— With No. cargoes. Tonnage. In No. ballast. Tonnage. British 162 260,312 240,321 62 168,209 Other flags 108 37 161,950 Cleared— British 86 96,155 138 332,366 Other flags 28 30,255 117 372,016 129. Certain of Ibn Sand’s treaties contain general provisions regarding commercial intercourse. In February 1929 he expressed a wish to conclude a commercial treaty with Great Britain. The proposal was first broached in the course of a conversation on Soviet activities in the Hejaz and in such a way as to make it clear that the King sought special advantages in return for his taking measures to encourage trade with Great Britain rather than with Russia. A draft treaty, prepared in consultation with the Board of Trade, was communicated to the Hejazi Government on the 13th April, 1930. It was realised that it would probably disappoint the King, as little could he put into the draft which would really attract him. He did not return to the subject up to the end of the year. In July he approached His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom with another commercial proposal different in its nature, but similar in tendency. He intimated his desire to do his buying in Great Britain, notwithstanding the temptations of other nations, hut he expressed dissatisfaction with the ordinary commercial channels and asked whether His Majesty’s Government would them selves act as his intermediaries. On being pressed to define his proposal more closely he explained that what he looked for was durability, quick delivery and payment by instalments. He was rather coy about indicating the classes of goods he required, but eventually produced in October a list of general headings of a rather alarmingly military character. There was ground for suspicion that what he was really after was to induce His Majesty’s Government to finance his transactions by placing his orders, ensuring delivery and not being too hard in the matter of exacting payment. Even were this not so, the proposal as formulated was not one which His Majesty’s Government could entertain. After due consideration, it was decided to inform Ibn Sand that His Majesty’s Government could not undertake to act as buyers on his behalf, but to add that they would be willing to give him advice in connexion with particular transactions of importance as they had recently done in the case of the Marconi wireless contract. The King was to have urged on him the desirability of doing business through established commercial houses. It was left to the discretion of His Majesty’s Minister to point out, if he thought fit, the advantages presented in this respect by Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Limited), having regard to their old standing and numerous commercial and financial connexions; and to draw attention to the importance of following sound business methods as regards punctuality of payment, &amp;c., if the Hejazi Government wished to do business with British firms on favourable terms. 130. It would be unjust to say that Ibn Sand is wholly indifferent to economic and commercial development, but he is wholly ignorant of how to set about it. Those of his advisers who are most interested in such matters are also those most likely to seek their own gain rather than take a large view of the interests of the country as a whole. Neither King nor advisers have any use for European experts, the employment of whom would be an almost essential condition of real progress. Were such experts employed, the creation of a port at Jedda would be an easy matter, as the roadstead consists of deep water enclosed by solid reefs of coral. The importance of this particular object may be gauged by the quantity of shipping which visits Jedda in connexion with the pilgrimage andgeneral trade, as shown in paragraph 128. Other necessary improvements like the construction of decent roads to replace the present tracks to Mecca and Medina and the laying on of water from the hills to Jedda and Mecca should present no difficulty other than that of providing initial capital for enterprises which would cost a good deal, but which would he remunerative, if well managed. It would Naturally be a much slower affair to provide a more extensive system of communications in a country so wild, so poor and so sparsely populated. 131. It is probable that some little progress was made with road improve ment in 1930. Reference has been made elsewhere to the project for an overland pilgrim route from the Persian Gulf Coast to Mecca, a distance of some 850 miles, which can already be traversed by car. It is also possible to use motor transport between Taif and the southern ports of Lith and Kunfunda. The Mecca newspaper 41 Umm-al-Qura of the 7th November proclaimed the existence of a motor route from Jedda to the Transjordan frontier on the strength of its having been traversed with cars by the Hejazi Government agent at the MacDonnell enquiry (see paragraph 26). The stages were given in kilometres as being Jedda to Medina, 420 ; Medina to Al-Ula, 360; Al-Ula to Qariyat, 748. 132. The King took an important step towards the development of other communications by placing a contract with the Marconi Company early in October 1930 for a system to link up Mecca Riadh and nine subsidiary stations at Qasim (? Ayun), Hail, Hasa (? Hofuf), Fabuk, Sha ara, Uqair, Qatif, Jubail and Uaf. The equipment was to include four mobile sets on Ford trucks. It was apparently arranged to work into the scheme the few existing wireless stations at Jedda, Jauf, Jizan and some other places. The cost, payable in instalments over three and a half years, was to he £36,900. lour selected youths were sent about the same time to be trained at the Marconi school at Chelmsford, and a wireless school was established at Jedda. According to the press forty-eight pupils were chosen out of a larger number of applicants. The school was a going concern at the end of the year. 132a The list of achievements mentioned in paragraph 115 and reproduced as a whole in Appendix II enumerates a few minor measures of an economic kind, not important enough to be dealt with in detail in this section, even if more were known of them. V.—Military Organisation. 133 Little can he said with confidence as to the exact nature of Ibn Sand s military organisation in 1930. Up to 1929 he had apparently relied on forces composed of personal soldiery including or consisting of slaves tribal levies and the Akhwan who may be regarded as an experiment in the creation of something between tribal levies and a standing army. The agricultural aspec of the Akhwan colonies has been dealt with in the preceding section. Mr. H'ham, in his description of the colonies, emphasises their military character and div . thl population into three categories' “ The first class,” he says, ‘ are hose who are ever ready, with rifle and ‘ zelul,’ to respond to the call—the jihad, the second class are the reserves, who in time of peace are herdsmen an journeyme ^ while the third class of the male population are those who f, n , th ® keep up its trade and agriculture. Even these are likely to be called to arms The same writer in his nominal list of sixty-one settlements, shows for each a quota of fighting men ranging from 300 to 2,500 men and divides his list according to tribes The quota given is, he says, as a rule, one-third of the male population, representing the men who respond to the first call. His list shows a total number of 65,300 fi|rting men of this kind, and he says that there were several settlements of two tribes not included in his nominal list. 133a If this account is accurate, Ibn Sand possessed before 1929 something in the nature of readilv available forces with a certain organisation; and he nossessed also considerable quantities of armament to which he has added largely Fn recent vears. What do2s not appear is how the Akhwan organisation was affected by the revolt of 1929, the tribes concerned in which on the rebel side were some of the most important shown in Mr. Biham’s list as supplying the 155451 D 4V 40 material for the colonies. Thus the Mutair, a tribe in which revolt was wide spread, if not universal, account for 13,200 men in the above total of 65,300. Artawiya, which was the first of the colonies, and is described by Mr. Philby in his recent book on Arabia as being “ as it were the cathedral town of the Akhwan movement,” was a rebel centre. It can hardly be supposed that the rebellion, however successfully it was suppressed, can have been without its effect on th« organisation considered as a military instrument in the hands of Ibn Sand, for h? saw it turned against him in 1929 by motive forces which included the fanatical Wahhabism that he had himself made the inspiration of the Akhwan. Mr. Philby, writing in 1930, ignores this, and still speaks in his book of the Akhwan as the corner-stone of Ibn Sand’s military power. “ The man-power of those colonies,” he says, “ each of which is in effect the cantonment of a permanent territorial force, constitutes the bulk of what may be regarded as his regular army.” 133b. It may be inferred from the meagre data available that it would be equally rash to assume that Ibn Sand could now count for all purposes on fighting forces in Nejd on the scale indicated by Mr. Rihani and Mr. Philby, or, on the other hand, to assume that he could not count on them for the purposes of a foreign adventure. Ihe matter deserves further attention on the part of those responsible for the defence of Iraq and Kowait, who are much closer to Nejd than is the Legation in Jedda. 133c. In the meantime the King has turned his attention in the Hejaz to the creation of the embryo of a regular army on European lines. In September 1930 it was announced that a certain Nabi Bey A1 Adhma, a Syrian ex-officer in the Turkish Army, had been appointed Director of Military Organisation. This officer resigned his post after a short tenure and was replaced by one Faudhi Bey a man of the same type, German trained, and at one time concerned m the rebellion against the French in Syria. He appears to be a man of intelli- and energy. Army organisation (including the purchase of aeroplanes, which will be dealt with in the next section) was mentioned in a list of the achievements published in the Mecca newspaper ” Umm-al-Qura ” of the 3rd October to which reference has already been made. The results achieved up to the end of the year may be gauged by the show made at a review held in Jedda early m January 1931 to celebrate the King’s accession. It is probable that the forces present represented the bulk of the regular army in the Hejaz. They consisted of two fairly workmanlike detachments of infantry, about 500 men in all; pack animals with various equipment and about 100 men in charge; two armoured cars; an ill-mounted and disorderly rabble of less than forty men forming tlm ‘‘cavalry ”; and a much more impressive camel corps of upwards of 320 men. Although this experiment is being tried in the Hejaz, it would appear that the elements in the force are largely Nejdi. The King’s ultimate ideal would appear to be to have a regular army to serve his purposes in both kingdoms. VI.— Aviation. 134. When Ibn Sand conquered the Hejaz, his prize of war included a certain number of aeroplanes, and he evolved the idea of possessing a small air orce. In and after 1926 the question of his obtaining British assistance to achieve this object was the subject of continuous negotiations, at first with a view to his securing British personnel and finally to his obtaining not only personnel but equipment under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. It had become apparent from the report of Wing-Commander F. W. Stent who visited Jedda in June 1929, that the existing machines could be put to little use except for practice and light flying. At that time Ibn Saud was very eager, perhaps because he hoped that an air force would help him to dominate the rebellious tribes with which he was having so much trouble. His Majesty’s Government were no less eager to help him for reasons of general policy from a desire not to see him turn elsewhere for what he wanted and from an ulterior nf n W1 be dea J w ! th L ‘J t r er ' tv r The scheme came to fruition in the autumn ot 1929. it was agreed that His Majesty’s Government should supply four Wapiti aeroplanes and equipment, and should put the King in the way of41 93 4 cngaging the services of four British pilots and six mechanics. The machines were to he of the most modern type and therefore dear. To make things easier, His Majesty s Government found means, by shouldering a part of the financial burden themselves, to quote a reduced price of about £23,240 for the aeroplanes and equipment, including a tidy supply of 201b. bombs. It was estimated that the jannual cost of the force would he £10,000 or rather more, but Ibn Saud was too Keen to flinch at this. The personnel were recruited with some difficulty. All was ready by the end of 1929, too late for the force to he used to crush the rebellion, which was already on its last legs but soon enough for the King not to go back on his bargain. 135. The King had contemplated a base on the Nejd coast and landing grounds at Shaara, Riadh and El-Mueh, places strung at fairly equal distances along the stretch of about 850 miles cross-country to Jedda. He decided to make a start at Darin Island, opposite Qatif, a spot which, except for its isolation, proved not unsuitable and which was adequately furnished for its purpose by the end of the year. The aeroplanes arrived at Darin iust before the 31st December, 1929. 136. The history of the air force in 1930 belied this bright beginning. Ibn Saud s outlook on his scheme had become increasingly military, but he adhered to his intention of haying civilian personnel. This increased the difficulty of main taining discipline in a place like Darin, and the difficulty was aggravated by the fact that, although the King’s agent at Bahrain looked after all financial matters, the control of the force was placed in the hands of the Emir Feisal, Viceroy of the Hejaz and resident at Mecca. The pilots split into two camps, one consisting of the chief pilot and one other, who were not men of strong personality but main tained the status of officers, while the remaining two pilots consorted freely with the mechanics, carousing with them on occasion and fostering, it would appear, the subversive spirit that animated some of them. A crisis arose in March, when a drunken bout resulted in one of the two pilots who frequented the mechanics being unfit for service on the day fixed for a flight. This led to his dismissal in May, to which Ibn Saud consented on the strong recommendation of His Majesty’s Government. His colleague remained to be a cause of scandal, and it was debated whether the King should not be advised to dismiss this man also—a course which it was desirable to avoid if possible, for Ibn Saud, having got his heart’s desire with the help of His Majesty’s Government, showed himself jealous of his authority over the force. 137. It had also been debated whether the King should not be urged to transfer the force to Jedda. Fortunately, he forestalled any such idea by himself deciding early in June to make the transfer. He requested permission to fly the aeroplanes over Kowait, Iraq and Transjordan, the direct route being impossible as no landing grounds had ever been' prepared; and the loan of a Royal Air Force pilot to bring the fourth machine, in place of the dismissed pilot, whom he had preferred not to replace. These facilities were accorded, and after some delay, including a stop at Hinaidi, the principal Royal Air Force base in Iraq, to fit the Wapitis with the latest improvements, the air force arrived in Jedda on the 14th September. It went on to visit the King at Taif and then settled down in its new home. 138. It was hoped that in the relatively civilised conditions of Jedda and m greater proximity to the Emir Feisal, the air force would regain the moral which had been so shaken by indiscipline at Darin. The question of promoting the dismissal of the one remaining pilot, who had been a source of difficulty there, was left in abeyance. Any hope of an improvement at Jedda speedily disappeared, however. Pilots and mechanics came to a place where there had never been a distinction among true Britons. As they were all civilians, the difficulty due to the necessity of making a distinction between officers and mechanics might have been overcome had it not been for what had happened in Darin. As it was they could not be easily fitted into the framework of the British community without prejudice to the position of the chief pilot and the colleague who was loyal to him; and what was not easy in itself was made impossible by the attitude of the third pilot. He continued to consort with the mechanics. He was not on speaking terms with his colleagues, lived apart and held studiously aloof from most of the British community, including the members42 of the Legation, who in more favourable circumstances might have exercised a soothing influence. The situation was aggravated by a minor but important cause. Hejaz-Nejd is theoretically a “dry' country. At Darin it had been possible to procure supplies of liquor and to some extent to control the use of it. The non-official members of the community in Jedda depend on smuggled alcohol, and some, though not all, of the abuses of a dry regime flourish. The difficulty ^ of getting regular supplies of honest beer and whiskey induces discontent; and it increases the danger of intemperance when liquor is obtainable. The men of the air force had little else to complain of; but they had few rational amusements, had too little to do and were earning more money than they need spend. Just before Christmas two of the mechanics exercised their contract right of resigning after a year’s service. The other four followed suit at the end of December. It looked as though the force were disintegrating, and it seemed difficult to do anything to repair the situation, although the Legation was giving the subject anxious consideration. 139. If His Majesty’s Government were not very successful in recruiting suitable personnel for an unusually difficult task, Ibn Saud on his side showed no capacity for utilising the force. Nothing was done to make landing grounds in the interior or to employ the force on any serious aviation work. In the autumn the King conceived the idea of using it to train native aviators, and it was announced that a school of airmanship was to be established in Jedda. An attempt was made at the same time to stimulate public interest and obtain funds for aeronautical purposes by the creation of an Arab Aeronautical Society. The society came into being. The school did not. The delay may have been partly due to the fact that in October the Hejazi Government sought the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in obtaining two instructional machines, as well as in getting machine guns and spare parts for the Wapitis; and His Majesty’s Government had been unable to reply to any of these requests up to the end of December. Financial stringency may also have been a contributory cause of the failure of the Government to make any real use of the air force. 140. The ulterior motive of His Majesty’s Government in promoting the creation of an air force with British personnel was well summed up in a letter of the 1st August, 1929, from the Foreign Office to the Air Ministry regarding the possibility of making favourable financial arrangements for the supply of material. “ Ibn Saud,” it was said, “controls one of the key positions on a route which is of vital importance from the point of view of inter-imperial communications”; and later in the same letter, “ should it be possible .... to secure that the development of the Hejaz Air Force, which [bn Saud now desires, should take place under British guidance and control, there is reason to believe that the eventual establishment of the proposed Arabian air route, which might otherwise prove difficult or even impossible, would be greatly facilitated.' This was not a new question, but it is unnecessary to go into its previous history. In 1930 the desirability of inducing Ibn Saud to consent in due course to the use of the Hasa Coast by British aeroplanes was increased by the ever more imminent prospect of difficulties with the Persian Government, when the agreement whereby Imperial Airways (Limited) carry the air mail to India over Persian territory should expire in April 1932. Two other causes, arising out of projects which eventually came to nothing, but which were very present in the minds of His Majesty’s Government in the spring, made the matter somewhat urgent early in 1930. Junkers were active and ventilated a proposal to fly pilgrims from Kerbela to Mecca. It was feared that they might pursue this project with Ibn Saud, independently of what they could achieve in Iraq, and that, if they succeeded, the establishment by a non-British firm of the first air route in Ibn Sand’s dominions might be a set-back to British aspirations. Secondly, certain American oil interests approached both Junkers and Imperial Airways (Limited) on the subject of a geological survey along the coast between Bahrain and Kowait to a depth of 100 or 200 miles. It was thought that if Junkers sought the assistance of the German Government in this connexion, His Majesty’s Government might be unable to refuse their own to Imperial Airways. It was felt that, if such support were given, Ibn Saud would not only refuse to entertain the survey scheme, but would conceive suspicions that would make it more difficult than ever to reconcile him to coastal flights by way of El Hasa,43 3as 141. The prospect of success in the last-named direction was not very bright at the best, for Ibn Sand was known to be jealous of his sovereignty and suspicious of foreign enterprise. He was very ready to protest against certain encroachments on his territory due to accident or to a wish to help his air force at Darin. It was nevertheless a point of policy to see how far he could be led in 4j|the direction of agreeing to flights along his coast and to the creation of one or more emergency landing grounds. There was one point in our favour, namely, that the Akhwan rebellion had been crushed, and the King no longer had in 1930 the plausible reasons which he could invoke in earlier years when there was a genuine danger that his recalcitrant tribes might resent the presence of foreign aeroplanes over their heads and accuse the King himself of impiety and complaisance vis-a-vis foreigners. It was eventually decided to approach the subject not with direct reference to the air route to India (although it was hinted at in the ensuing conversations), but by reviving an earlier proposal to institute flights for the transport of pearls from Bahrain to Iraq. When this scheme was again brought up for consideration early in 1930, it was thought that Imperial Airways (Limited) might organise the flights. They declined for reasons of finance to undertake it, though they thought that they might work the pearling flights in conjunction with other projects in 1931. His Majesty’s Government then decided to endeavour to secure Ibn Saud’s consent to a series of pearling flights to be carried out by Royal Air Force machines at fortnightly intervals between Bahrain and Basra during the 1930 season. It was hoped that if this could be achieved, he and his tribes would become familiar with the idea of regular flying over, one or more emergency landing grounds would be brought into being, experience would be gained and an approach made to the possibility of obtaining Ibn Saud’s ultimate consent to the larger scheme for the use of the Hasa Coast as a stage on the route to India. 142. After a preparatory conversation with his Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in May regarding air matters generally, the proposal regarding pearling flights was broached orally to Ibn Baud at an audience on the 12th June. His reaction was not wholly unfavourable. He admitted spontaneously that his former objections, based on the danger of tribal opposition and misrepresenta tion, no longer existed. He said, however, that the proposal required serious consideration and that he must consult his local authorities. His Majesty’s Government decided not to press him unduly, as it was of greater importance to induce a favourable frame of mind than to ensure his consent to pearling flights in the course of a season which had already begun. When the King asked in June for facilities for the transfer of his Air Force from Darin to Jedda, it was con sidered whether he should be asked to make a concession in regard to British flying over El Hasa as a quid pro quo. It was decided not to make the facilities conditional on such a concession, but the King was reminded of the desire of His Majesty’s Government that their proposal regarding experimental flights during the pearling season and the marking out of the necessary emergency landing grounds should be favourably considered. He replied on the 4th July through his Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that he had ordered the competent authorities to study the matter and to seek out suitable places in the islands off the coast for emergency landing grounds, but that owing to the distances involved it would not be possible to return a definite answer for some time. 143. It still seemed unadvisable to press the King too hard, and the matter was allowed to remain in abeyance after a further conversation with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 15th July, which marked no definite advance. Thus the total progress made in 1930 amounted to little, but something important, if not very definite, was achieved Ibn Saud’s attitude had been tested and found not entirely refractory. He had had impressed on him a conception of what might be expected in the way of air facilities from a monarch desirous of marching with the modern world. In August, before the Hejaz Air Force left Darin, the chief pilot was sent to reconnoitre the islands on the Hasa coast for possible landing grounds—the King showed no inclination to have these on the mainland. The chief pilot, after visiting three islands, pronounced in favour of one named Jinnah, in a gulf about half-way from Bahrain to the Kowait border. He indicated the work which would be necessary to adapt it to the proposed purpose. He was accompanied by one of the Qusaibi family of merchants, who44 stand high in Ibn Sand’s favour and who have a commercial interest in the possibility of pearling flights. In October Fuad Bey Hamza displayed interest in the Interna tional Air Convention to the extent of asking the Lega tion in Jed da for a copy of it. VII.— Legislation. 144. Moslem law, as understood by the Wahhabis, is the common law of Hejaz-Nejd and is supposed to govern all matters. The Constitution of the Hejaz (see paragraph 112) provides, however, for legislation by the King on the advice of a consultative council. A number of regulations have, in fact, been issued in recent years, some of them dealing with important matters It is difficult to get a complete or general view of this body of law owing to the fact that it has not been officially collected, nor is there anything in the nature of an “ Official Gazette.” Laws and regulations appear in the columns of the “ Umm-al-Qura ” newspaper and get bulled in its files. 145. The extent of the difficulty was amusingly illustrated in 1930, when the Foreign Office, in order to oblige the Librarian of Congress at Washington, instructed the Legation in Jedda to furnish a list of Hejaz-Nejd official publica tions and to provide information as to the best means of obtaining copies. In a reply of the 23rd November to a private letter from His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires, the then Acting Minister for F'oreign Affairs forwarded a list, on the understanding that he could not vouch for its completeness. He promised to enquire of other authorities about their publications. As for copies, he could not indicate any place in which they could be obtained, but he undertook to do his best to get as complete a collection as possible. 146. Fuad Bey’s list presumably included only publications in separate pamphlet form. That may be why it did not mention the Constitution itself or, for instance, the Hejazi Law on Nationality, which has been a subject of frequent discussion with his own department since its promulgation in 1926. bo far as it went, however, it was sufficiently imposing, as, in addition to certain treaties, it mentioned fourteen regulations on the following subjects :— Pi •ess and printed publications Municipal matters. Registration of deaths of pilgrims and the disposal of their effects. Curriculum of preparatory schools. Schools. Ministry of Finance. Registration of companies. Distribution of charitable funds. Motor service between Jedda and Mecca. Stamp duties. Vaccination. Customs. Hejaz currency. Motor service between Jedda and Medina. 147. It is hoped to deal more satisfactorily with this subject in the annual report for 1931. VIII.— Press. 148. The Hejaz possesses one newspaper, the l ' Umm-al-Qura, which is published weekly on Friday in Mecca It is to all intents and purposes a ment paper, although it is not in theory official. It is a good deal controlled by Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, the King’s private secretary and factotum, a young Syrian with a prolific pen of his own. The views expounded by the paper on political and religious subjects are those of the King and his Government. The paper has little value as a news-sheet, but gives a certain amount of useful information of a local kind, mostly in regard to what happens in Mecca and Jedda.39 6 45 149. The editor of the “ Umm-al-Qura ” told Sir A. Ryan early in 1931 that there were five printing presses in the country besides his own, and that two of them belonged to the Government. There is little sign of their activity, as all printing which comes to the notice of the Legation appears to be done at the “ Umm-al-Qura ” press, including a small output of official publications, like the 4 ^occasional Green Books containing treaties, &amp;c. 150. The existence of an Official Pi’ess Bureau is revealed by the publica tion in its name of occasional communiques. There is no other evidence of organisation for control or propaganda purposes, nor are there any European foreign correspondents settled in the country except Mr. Philby, who sends frequent letters to the “Near East ” and is said to act for the “ Daily Herald.” The manager of Gellatly, Hankey and Co. s Jedda branch acts rather vaguely for Reuter. 151. Foreign press correspondents occasionally visit Jedda, and if they are Moslems they range further afield. Thus Mme. Berthe Gaulis came to the Hejaz in 1929 and M. J. Londres, of the “ Petit Parisien,” in 1930. Such persons are received with courtesy, and suitable attempts are made to ‘‘propagand them. The presence of a delegation of Egyptian journalists was a noticeable feature of the first official celebration of Ibn Baud's accession in January 1930. 152. Nothing is known in Jedda of any press activity in Nejd. There is probably no native press, but the following passage may be quoted from the Administrative Report for the Persian Gulf for 1929, a year, it may be noted, when the rebellion of Feisal-ad-Dawish, &amp;c., drew much attention to the eastern side of Ibn Sand's dominions :— “ Ibn Baud thoroughly understands the use of the press, and a constant stream of Egyptian, Syrian and Iraqi journalists pours through Bahrain to visit Ibn Sand and be suitably fed by him. He has even paid Bahrain schoolmasters to write him up.” IX. —Education. 153. It has not been possible to obtain any general view of this subject for the purposes of this report. It can confidently be said that very little has been done to promote education on modern lines in the country as a whole. The Hejazi Constitution, however, makes provision for a Department of Education, and it is understood that an Egyptian is employed in connexion with this at Mecca. A more or less private school run at Mecca under Indian auspices appears to be well attended. The list of Government achievements mentioned in paragraph 115 states that the number of schools has been increased, and that additions have been made to the number of students sent to Egypt. The incomplete list of laws in paragraph 146 mentions a general regulation on schools, and a regulation on the curriculum in preparatory schools. English is taught in at least one school in Mecca, and there is a school of agriculture, dating from an earlier regime, in Jedda. These scraps of information indicate a certain concern on the part of the Government with elementary education, but there are no signs of anything in the nature of higher education, except perhaps of a purely Islamic kind, and except in so far as a certain number of youths are sent abroad for various studies. 154. An attempt will be made to deal more comprehensively with the subject in the annual report for 1931. X. —The Pilgrimage. 155. As the pilgrimage is the subject each year of a special report from Jedda, only its more salient aspects need be dealt with here. It has already been mentioned that it is almost the sole industry of the Hejaz. It creates for46 the principal countries of origin peculiarly difficult problems of an administra tive, sanitary and, in some cases, economic character. It is therefore worth while to consider the volume and fluctuations of the pilgrimage from overseas, bearing in mind that the figures include a small proportion of sea-borne pilgrims from other parts of the Hejaz and the adjoining Arab countries, and that, while the bulk of the pilgrims arriving by land come from the interior of Arabia, theyj^ include a small proportion of aliens, like those who make their way overland, sometimes from very far afield, across the Peninsula. The sea-borne foreign pilgrims are, nevertheless, by far the most important element from every point of view. All figures are approximate, but those given in successive pilgrimage reports may be taken as being fairly accurate. The total number of overseas pilgrims in the last three years of the Hashimite regime were estimated at 56,319 in 1922; 75,221 in 1923; and 92,707 in 1924. In 1925 Ibn Sand already held Mecca, but the Hashimites were still in possession of Jedda and there was war between them. This reduced the pilgrimage to very small proportions. The following table gives the estimated numbers for the five years after the completion of Ibn Baud's conquest of the Holy Land. It shows the figures for the principal countries of origin, those for the more important countries forming part of the British Empire or directly administered by Great Britain being given in detail. A certain number of miscellaneous British subjects are included under the heading “ Other.” Estimated Number of Overseas Pilgrims for the Five Years 1926 to 1930.

The figure 5,500 was an approximate estimate of the number of Malayans in a total of 9,608 embarked there in 1926. The figure for 1927 is the total number of pilgrims embarked at Singapore, but it is understood that only 12,000 odd of them were Malayans. 156. The above table shows that in 1926, the first year of Ibn Baud’s complete supremacy in the Hejaz and the year of the International Moslem Conference held under his auspices at Mecca, there was a distinct revival of the pilgrimage. In 1927 his reputation in the Moslem world was at its zenith and it was a bumper year. In addition to the 132,000 odd pilgrims from overseas, there was an enormous gathering from the interior, and it was estimated that the total number present during the Aid or festival, which marks the culminating point of the pilgrimage to Mecca, was not less than 220,000. The subsequent years show a falling off attributable to various causes, including economic depression. This made itself most felt towards the end of 1930, and although anticipatory estimates are uncertain, it was clear that in 1931 the decrease would be so great as to menace the finances of the Hejaz most seriously. In December it looked as though the overseas }&gt;ilgrimage must at the best fall short by one-third of the figures for 1930. 157. The Indian pilgrimage presents very difficult problems, not only owing to the number of pilgrims involved, but to their diversity of race and47 language and the large admixture of foreign elements who travel to the Hejaz by way of British Indian jxjrts. The numerous questions which arise were studied in 1929 by a strong committee appointed by the Government of India and consisting of nine leading Indian Moslems with a British chairman. The two reports of this Haj Enquiry Committee, which were printed early in 1930, are documents of great value, although many of the questions dealt with require further exploration. A large part of the published report relates to questions affecting the handling and well-being of the pilgrim in India and shipping arrangements. These are in the main outside the scope of this report. Some, however, of the recommendations relate to matters affecting the work of the British Legation in Jedda. Among other things the committee reported in favour of a system whereby the return journey of the pilgrim should be assured by his making a deposit before departure to replace the present system, under which, subject to certain exceptions, he is compelled to book a return ticket. Suggestions were made regarding the form of pilgrim passes and the organisa tion of shipping with a view to the provision of more regular sailings both ways. Measures were suggested with a view to curtailing the activities in India of the Muallim or pilgrim guide, a subject which will be mentioned later. Broadly speaking the committee favoured, subject to certain reservations, measures to harmonise Indian regulations with the International Sanitary Convention of 1926, which India has not yet ratified. In particular, they favoured compulsory inoculation against cholera before the pilgrim’s departure. 158. The confidential report of the Haj Enquiry Committee dealt more particularly with the pilgrim in the Hejaz. It discussed numerous subjects, including the provision of suitable and adequate staff at Jedda for dealing with pilgrims, landing arrangements, deposit of papers at the Legation, possible improvements in the Mutawwif system, increased medical assistance by the Government of India, taxation and sanitary dues, housing at Jedda, the possibility of preventing the misdirection of Wakfs created for the benefit of pilgrims and various minor matters. The recommendations of the committee were the subject of much correspondence during the remainder of the year, but the work of examining and reporting on them in Jedda was much hampered by the insufficiency of career staff. The Legation comprises a special Indian Section, the head of which has a most extensive knowledge of all pilgrimage matters and cannot be too highly praised for his devotion to the interest of pilgrims. He is, however, somewhat deficient in knowledge of English and in capacity for arranging material or taking dispassionate views. The Indian pilgrimage and matters connected with it consequently throw more work on the Minister and the Head of the Chancery than they can easily perform consistently with their other duties. 159. The Malay pilgrimage has diminished greatly in recent years and is well organised. The special work connected with it is done by a senior Malay member of the Straits Settlements Civil Service, who is sent to Jedda for several months each year. The Sudanese and Palestinian pilgrimages call for no special comment in a general report. 160. The question of a better organisation of the pilgrimage from the British dependencies in West Africa continued to engage attention throughout 1930. Those partaking in it are for the most part of the poorest and most primitive class. They ordinarily trek across Africa and eventually embark at Suakin or Massowah, being in many cases attracted to the latter place by the facilities existing there for obtaining cheap passages by dhow to ports south of Jedda. They thereby escape the obligation to travel by steamer, as they have to do from Suakin, where moreover they are compelled to take return tickets, if they start during the months preceding the pilgrimage time and also apparently the heavy Hejazi dues for quarantine, &amp;c., payable by all pilgrims landing at Jedda. Prepared as he is to give unlimited time to his pilgrimage, in some cases several years, to walk unlimited distances on both sides of the Red Sea and to earn his livelihood by the way, the West African thinks it a small matter to go by land to Massowah in order to save a pound or two on his sea passage. Many undesirable consequences ensue. Sanitary control is less effective. The number of destitutes without return tickets in the Hejaz is increased. The dhow traffic lends itself more easily than steamer traffic to the transport of slaves in smallM 48 numbers, carried in the guise of pilgrims. In 1928 the Italian Government gave a formal undertaking to prevent the departure of pilgrims by dhow from Massowah, but the undertaking has not been carried out. The question whether pressure can be exerted to secure its fulfilment is an important element in the problem of the West African pilgrimage. 161. In 1928 the Nigerian Government propounded a scheme for controlling their pilgrims at source and throughout the pilgrimage with the co-operation of the Sudan Government and His Majesty’s Legation at Jedda. 1 he general plan was to encourage, and perhaps eventually compel, the pilgrim to make a deposit to cover the expenses of the pilgrimage before leaving Nigeria and to take out a special form of passport containing vouchers to be exchanged for return tickets from railhead in the Sudan to Suakin and from Suakin to Jedda by steamer The Sudan Government whose co-operation was essential, received the proposal with distaste, one of the reasons given being that measures of control so bureaucratic were “ alien to the whole age-old spirit of the pilgrimage that long drawn out religious adventure on which the pilgrim embarks without too much thought for the morrow, relying on the opportunities of earning the wherewithal which the journey itself will provide, ignorant of when or where these will occur and of how long the quest may take, but happily untroubled by those uncertainties.” 162. This romantic objection had a more prosaic economic background. One of the objects of the Nigerian Government was to speed up the pilgiim, but his slowness of movement makes him a valuable asset in the Sudan, where his labour is welcome especially in the cotton-growing area. Ihe Sudan Govern ment had, however, more legitimate objections to the Nigerian scheme on the ground that its complexity would entail great labour on their officials; and in its complete form it would also add a great deal to the work of the Legation in Jedda. Both Khartum and Jedda were prepared to assist in a reduced scheme, on the principles of which they were in general agreement at the end of 1930. Unfortunately it is a far cry from Lagos to the Colonial Office; the passage from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office is longer than it seems; and it is a long long way from the Foreign Office to Khartum via Cairo or to Jedda by the bag route. The correspondence since 1928 has proceeded with all the sLitely grace and much more than the slowness of a minuet. At the end of the yeai it was as badly in need of “ speeding up ” as any Nigerian pilgrim. 163. A very brief mention may be made of the tendency to try and create new pilgrim routes. Certain pilgrims from further east make me leasing use of the transdesert route from Iraq to the Syrian coast. The Junkers scheme for transporting pilgrims by air has been mentioned in paragraph 140. Ibn Sand and the Persian Government are understood to be both interested in a scheme for developing an overland route by car from the Hasa Coast to the llejaz (see paragraph 92) The establishment of practicable road communication between Transjordan and the Holy Cities (see paragraph 131) may m due course bring pilgrims from rail-head at Maan in anticipation of the reorganisation of the Hejaz Railway further south. Some of these developments have already created new problems. The question of controlling and directing the movement of pilgrims via Iraq engaged much attention during 1930. It may be noted that an increase in the number of Indian pilgrims arriving via Iraq was given as one of the reasons for a marked increase in the number of destitutes who had to be repatriated from Jedda at the expense of the Government of India at the end of the 1930 season. 164. We turn to the pilgrim in the Hejaz. It is the boast of Ibn Saud that the well-being of pilgrims is his constant concern. The conditions are undoubtedly better than they were in the last years of the Hashimite regime. The King established and has maintained security on the pilgrim roads in the Heiaz There has, however, been little progress in other directions and m some ways there has been a deterioration since 1926-27. The list of Government achievements mentioned in paragraph 115 and reproduced in Appendix II enumerates various measures stated to have been adopted for the benefit of pilgrims Some of the claims made in this statement are justified. 1 he arrange ments for water supply at Mecca have been improved, access to and circulation49 Z6/ [5545] E in Muna have been facilitated and some moderate medical provision with accommodation has been made at Bahra. On the other hand little has in reality been done for the roads. One section of that between Jedda and Mecca, which was remade in 1927, has been allowed to lapse. Any increase in the facilities for medical assistance is more than counter-balanced by the paucity and inefficiency of the doctors employed. Complaints of pilferage and neglect to recover effects ^ lost by pilgrims on the wayside have been on the increase. 165. One of the most serious examples of deterioration is the failure to maintain the strict control of mutawwifs or pilgrim guides which it was sought to enforce in the first years of the new regime. The mutawwif is a constant source of trouble unless he is kept well in hand. His activities in India, where he is commonly called a muallim, are trenchantly criticised in the Haj Enquiry Committee’s published report. The chief grievance against him in that country is that he or the assistants whom mutawwifs frequently send there lure people without adequate means of making the pilgrimage into undertaking it, and they prey in various ways on the pilgrims who commit themselves to their charge. The role played in the Hejaz by the mutawwifs and other persons engaged jointly with them in the business of guiding pilgrims is very important, as law and custom have invested them with functions which make them responsible for everything connected with the pilgrim from the moment of his arrival at Jedda until he departs or dies. The system is too complicated to describe at length here, but it is fully explained in the special pilgrimage report for 1930. Its abuses are partly due to the practice of including various taxes payable to the Govern ment in the charges which the mutawwifs, &amp;c., are authorised to levy. These taxes tend to increase owing to financial stress, and the Government have an interest in not bearing too hard on the guides, who on the one hand serve as tax collectors and are on the other hand apt to see their own margin of profit dimmish unless they compensate themselves by illegitimate means. 165a Two further points may be mentioned in connexion with the mutawwif question as it presented itself in 1930. A proposal was mooted early in the year for the re-establishment of an old system known as Taqrir, whereby pilgrims from particular districts in the Moslem world were assigned definitely to particular mutawwifs. This system is still in force as regards some categories of pilgrims, but in most cases there is a freedom of choice. The generalisation of the Taqrir system would bring financial gain to the Hejazi Government, by enabling them to farm out the Moslem world by a kind of auction to mutawwiis. It would deprive the pilgrim of such little benefit as he derives from a more competitive system. It is to the credit of Ibn Saud that he postponed considera tion of the scheme at least until 1931. Secondly, as part of the efforts which the British authorities constantly make to confine mutawwifs and their agents within certain limits, arrangements were made in 1930 to draw up black lists of undesirables, with a view to their being refused passport facilities to go to India and Malaya. The arrangements in the case of those who might wish to go to Malaya were adopted in concert with the Netherlands legation in Jedda. 166. The increased use of motor cars has done much to revolutionise pilgrimage conditions for those who can afford hired transport. It has turned the camelmen, formerly employed, into a depressed and discontented class. In a country of bad roads and incompetent drivers it leads to a certain number of accidents It leads to various ramps, like that by which pilgrim cars are not allowed to load at Jedda more petrol than will suffice for the single journey to Mecca, so that further supplies must be procured from the purveyors there. On the whole, however, the facilities for motor transport increase the ease and rapidity with which the pilgrimage can be accomplished by the moderately well-to-do, especially those who go to Medina as well as Mecca. In 1930 the use of cars was for the first time allowed in certain cases for the ceremonial visits to Muna and Arafat. The principal persons to enjoy the privilege were members of the Royal Family and household and Nejdi officials, who made the pilgrimage in large numbers, although the contingent of ordinary pilgrims from the interior was small. 167. The climatic conditions at Mecca were good in 1930, and there was unusually little disease or mortality. The dispersal of the pilgrims was effected50 on the whole satisfactorily, although much resentment was aroused by a decision to detain the general run of pilgrims at Mecca for some days until those intending to go to Medina had got away. This was attributed to a desire on the part of the Government to make sure of the revenue accruing from the pilgrimage to Medina. The koshan, or road tax, on those proceeding to that place by hired transport is very heavy, and it was suggested that the Government wished to.^ reduce the possibility of pilgrims, who might intend to go to Medina, getting 1 as far as Jedda with the rank and file and then abandoning their intention. 168. It would take too long to deal in this report with other features of the 1930 pilgrimage, but two or three are worth mentioning. 169. There was no Sacred Caravan from Egypt (see paragraph 86), but the medical mission which is sent annually from that country was accorded greater facilities than it had enjoyed in 1929. Any good effect resulting from this on the relations between Egypt and Hejaz-Nejd was offset by the resentment caused in the Hejaz by the decision of the Alexandria Quarantine Board to declare the pilgrimage infected with cholera. The following was the course of this incident, which has been mentioned more briefly elsewhere in other connexions (see para graphs 87 and 98). On the 14th May the Hejaz Government officially declared the pilgrimage clean. The sanitary authorities at Tor nevertheless conceived suspicions of the possible existence of cholera among returning pilgrims, and on the 22nd May the Permanent Commission of the Alexandria Board declared that the pilgrimage must be considered infected until further notice. The suspicions at Tor do not appear to have been confirmed by the discovery of any unmistakable case of Asiatic cholera there, hut they were grave in themselves, and they were strengthened by the discovery of an undoubted case at Massowah on the 27th May. In these circumstances, the decision of the board was made definite for the rest of the season, with the quasi-political consequences noted in paragraph 87. 170. This episode caused great inconvenience to north-bound pilgrims. It was all the more unfortunate, however unavoidable, because every one acted in complete good faith. The Hejazi Government had no reason to suspect the existence of cholera, and the investigations which they made, apparently with some care when doubt was thrown on the pilgrimage, still revealed no signs of cholera in the Hejaz. They very foolishly imputed bad faith to other authorities, but there is no reason to believe that they themselves concealed guilty knowledge. The only fair criticism is that they have not brought into existence any sanitary organisation adequate to inspire confidence in other Powers. 171. A disaster, unprecedented in the history of Jedda, though not in that of pilgrim ships elsewhere, occurred on the evening of the 21st May. A French steamer, the “ Asia,' caught fire in the outer harbour that afternoon after loading her full complement of some 1,500 pilgrims, mostly from the Yemen, but including some 300 from French Somaliland. The local authorities did what they could by turning out all the dhows and organising relief on shore, and notable assistance worthy of the best traditions of the mercantile marine was rendered by British ships in port; but some 115 persons lost their lives on board the “ Asia ” or by drowning. The causes of the fire were and remain obscure. The “ Asia ” was in any case a worn-out passenger ship, quite unsuitable for the pilgrim trade. An enquiry, conducted incompetently by the local authorities, threw little light on the matter. XI. —Slavery and the Slave Trade. 172. The question of slavery in the countries bordering on the Red Sea attracted much attention during 1930. Few problems connected with Arabia are more baffling. The whole subject, as seen from the Hejaz, was the subject of an able memorandum drawn up early in the year by Mr. Bond, then His Majesty s Charge d Affaires at Jedda. 1 his paper, which was sent home on the 6th March, 1930, should be studied by anyone who wishes for further information than can be given within the limits of this report.51 [5545] e 2 ? 173. The following are the main factors in a very obscure situation :— {a) Large numbers of slaves of Abyssinian and other African origins are available on the African side of the southern entrance to the Red Sea, as a result of the lawlessness and occasional warfare in the regions not effectively controlled ^by the French and Italians or lying outside their dependencies. The cost to the trader on the African coast is put at from £1 to £2 a head in cases where the slaves are acquired by purchase. (b) The slaves are exported mainly, it would appear, from places on the coast of French Somaliland, from Tajura northwards, and there may be a certain export from Eritrea. The measures taken by the French authorities to prevent the trade are either inefficient or, in the opinion of many, half-hearted, even in places where they are in a position to exercise real control. There is less reason to reproach the Italian authorities, but in one respect their attitude is open to definite criticism, for they continue to allow the shipment of pilgrims by dhows from Massowah to the Hejaz, notwithstanding the promise given by them in 1928 to prohibit this (see paragraph 160). The pilgrim dhow is a potential means of smuggling slaves who cannot be identified as such, though it is improbable that many slaves are, in fact, transported in this way. (c) The maritime control of the traffic devolves almost entirely on His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, who maintain two sloops in the Red Sea, mainly for this purpose and that of preventing illicit arms traffic. The French and Italian? theoretically contribute their quota of naval effort, but such small use as they make of sloops in the Red Sea is directed to other objects. French sloops belonging to the naval division in the Levant pay occasional visits, but they do not carry out any patrolling. An Italian sloop based on Massowah is said to be used more for survey work than for patrols and spends a great part of its time in port. (d) The operations of the British sloops are surrounded by every kind of difficulty owing to the greatness of the area for which they are responsible, the nature of the waters at the southern end of the Red Sea, and the lack of an efficient intelligence system working in collaboration with the navy. This last is an element of great importance, for it pays the slavers on their side to maintain what is said to be an efficient intelligence service of their own. No captures of slavers have been effected for many years. It is sometimes inferred that the sloops serve no useful purpose as regards the restraint of slave traffic. This view is probably erroneous. There is no doubt that naval control, even though confined within the narrow limits imposed by the difficulties inherent in the task of the sloops and by considerations of economy, is a deterrent if only because it prevents any large- scale shipment of slaves and the slavers are thrown back on the employment of small, swift dhows, run with every precaution to carry small parties. (e) The institution of slavery is prevalent throughout Arabia. In Hejaz- Nejd, as opposed to certain regions outside the scope of this report, where a form of plantation slavery is said to exist, the demand is for what may be roughly described as slaves for luxury purposes like the use of girls and women as wives or concubines and various forms of personal service, which attach the slaves to the household or immediate entourage of the owner. It is impossible to estimate the total number of slaves or to say to what extent the supply is kept up by repro duction of slave stock in the country and by importation respectively. The market value of slaves is high, and it has been said that a good-looking adolescent girl will fetch as much as £80. This figure cannot be vouched for, but it affords an indication of the profit which may accrue from the successful running of slaves. In the main the condition of slaves once settled in their servitude would appear to be not unhappy and to be favourably affected by the legal safeguards which distinguish slavery, as practised in more or less civilised Islamic countries, from the old plantation slavery, the character of which first aroused the moral sense of Europe to the turpitude of slavery as an institution as distinct from the horrors of enslavement and slave traffic. (/) As stated elsewhere, Ibn Baud bound himself by article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda “ to co-operate by all means at his disposal with His Britannic Majesty in the suppression of the slave trade.” He showed in 1930 the most complete reluctance to enter into a similar commitment vis-a-vis France and Italy. Whatever he has done or left undone to implement his obligation under the Treaty of Jedda, he shows no inclination whatsoever to put an end to slavery inside his5*2 dominions. During the negotiations which preceded the Treaty of Jedda, he refused to commit himself in any way in this respect. He asquiesced unwillingly in the maintenance of the system under which slaves taking refuge at the British agency are manumitted (see letters (3) and (4) annexed to the Treaty of Jedda), but he does not admit the validity of the basis on which this system rests and he has probably taken steps to limit the access of slaves to the present Legation. His^v attitude is probably determined by unwillingness to interfere with an institution which, even though illegal abuses have been grafted on to it, is quite definitely tolerated by Islamic law; by fear of outraging his subjects; and, not least, by considerations of his personal convenience, as he and his family maintain large numbers of slaves for every purpose from that of the harem to that of military service. 174. The factors having been thus analysed, something may be added under the heads which come more particularly within the scope of this report. The ^ Legation in Jedda is not concerned with (a) and (b), except in so far as the continued existence of easy sources of supply may contribute to the continued prevalence of slavery in Hejaz-Nejd. It may, however, be observed that interest in the whole subject of the disposal as well as the recruitment of slaves was stimulated in 1930 by a series of articles by a certain M. Kessel, published in the Paris “ Matin ” in May and June, and to some extent by the allegations of a German named Gruehl, which appeared in various newspapers towards the end of the year. 175. It has been shown under head (c) how little help is afforded by France and Italy in naval measures to control the slave traffic across the Straits of Bab-aT Mandab. Neither Power should be accused too lightly of complete indifference to the survival of the slave trade. Neither could, without taking very drastic and expensive measures, prevent all movement of slaves through French Somaliland and Eritrea. If neither seemed likely at the end of 1930 to insist to the last on the insertion in their treaties with Ibn Saud of articles similar to article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda, it may be urged in their defence that the practical value of such articles would be too small to justify the two Powers in breaking off negotiations of wider scope for the sake of them. When it comes to naval measures, however, France might well be expected to do more to police her ports and the adjoining seas and Italy to give effect to her promise to prevent the shipment of pilgrims by dhow from Massowah, to which reference has been made in paragraph 160. As regards general patrolling of the Straits and the neighbouring- seas, the open failure of France to participate can only be regretted. The position as regards Italy is less clear, for His Majesty’s Government were themselves averse in 1924 from accepting an Italian offer of co-operation; and this aversion, the reasons for which are not known in Jedda, was reaffirmed by the Admiralty in different circumstances in 1929. It seems to have been still entertained in 1930. 175a. Whatever may be said for or against the attitude of the French and Italians, the fact remains that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom stand alone, as regards naval measures, and they will probably stand alone until the time, if it ever comes, when the Arabian potentates in the countries into which the slaves are imported from Africa can be brought within the orbit of action by the League of Nations to promote the repression of all slavery. 176. The justification for the maintenance of British naval measures and the difficulties militating against their complete efficiency have been indicated in general terms under head (d). The quarterly reports by the Senior Naval Officer, Red Sea Sloops, on action taken during 1930 may be summed up as follows for the whole period :— Number of dhows examined, 89, nothing suspicious being found in any of the cases. Special operations {e.g., destroyer patrols and the like), nil. Mileage covered on slave patrol, 16,355 knots. These reports also specify under two heads the intelligence available. The information derived from Aden Intelligence Summaries (which are prepared expressly for other purposes and represent the results of expenditure which can not be made to cover a special intelligence service for the slave trade) was nil. The information from other sources was that supplied by His Majesty’s Legation at Addis Ababa, which %7it(zv ciUa was at one moment able to report the departureZ n a 30 of a convoy of seventy slaves by rail to Jibuti, and miscellaneous items collected by the Commander of H.M.S. “ Dahlia,” who, during the year, was the officer principally employed in specific action for the repression of slave trade, and who has displayed most commendable activity. 177. In presence of the foregoing summary of the naval returns for 1930, it may again be urged that the value of the British naval patrols cannot be judged by the meagreness of the results shown. Their success in the past in restricting the slavers to what are called retail operations only makes the present task of the sloops more difficult. The dhows most likely to carry slaves are those most likely to evade examination, for it pays those interested in a lucrative speculation u take every precaution to disguise the character of any slaves carried if they aie pounced upon. This is easy. The great majority of the slaves carried nowadays are children, both boys and girls approaching adolescence. It is not uncommon for dhowmen engaged in legitimate traffic to carry their families. Small parties of boys and girls carried as slaves can therefore be passed off as the immediate relations of the small-scale slave-runner. It does not appear that any important number of adults are carried, but, if necessary, men can be represented as members of the crew, women as wives. The victims themselves cannot be relied on to give evidence to the contrary, partly because of the difficulty of interrogating them in their own languages, and partly because of their fear lest the danger of ultimate vengeance be greater than the promise of immediate escape. The pilgrimage may also be a cloak for slavery transactions. This is one reason why it is so desirable to induce the Italians to make the prohibition of the transport of pilgrims By dhow effective, and, for our own part, to improve the control of the pilgrimage from West Africa, a subject which has been dealt with in the previous section. 178. It may, perhaps, be hoped that causes other than the fear of naval patrols tend to reduce the number of slaves carried across the Red Sea. It is possible that the exactions of local chiefs in Africa through whose area the slaves pass, increased cost of living in the countries of destination, the diminution in the demand for slaves for certain purposes, and to some extent the necessity for greater circumspection and the abolition of public slave markets tend to make the trade less lucrative. These, however, are matters of surmise, whereas the naval patrols are a concrete fact. It is, therefore, for consideration whether more can be done to increase their utility in the present conditions— (1) By increasing the naval force available and arranging for aerial co-operation; (2) By improved intelligence; and (3) By arrangements with other Powers for freedom to operate in territorial waters and a stricter control of dhow’s papers. 179. Several of the suggestions tentatively put forward in Mr. Bond’s memorandum of the 6th March come under one or other of these three heads. Most, if not all, of the questions on which their practicality turns had been considered before and have been considered since. So many departments at home and so many authorities abroad, not all in close touch with each other, have, however, been concerned that perhaps the time has come for a general stock-taking. 179a. The question of increasing the means at the disposal of the navy assumes two forms, according to whether the object should be pursued by increasing the number of sloops or supplementing the present sloops by the use of lighter craft for localised subsidiary patrols and close pursuit of dhows in waters inaccessible to sloops. The first alternative would facilitate more constant patrolling of the present kind than is possible with two sloops, each of which spends part of the year in the Mediterranean, and one of which is apt to be in the northern part of the Red Sea, even when both are south of Suez. This alternative seems to be barred by the expense of maintaining more sloops and the uncertainty of obtaining results. The various suggestions made up to date in connexion with the second alternative appear to be regarded by the Admiralty as impracticable. As for aerial co-operation, the Air Ministry suggested in September 1930 the experimental use of float planes to obtain information regarding dhows in reef areas, and the Foreign Office concurred subject to their not flying over Yemen or French and Italian territorial waters, but the naval authorities appear to be doubtful as to the utility of any form of air patrol. [5545] ' E 3— 54 180. All concerned agree that a better intelligence service would be ol great value, but up to the end of 1930 little progress had been made in the laying of definite plans to provide it. The most concrete proposal known to the Legation in Jedda was one which emerged in the early summer from consultations between His Majesty’s Minister at Addis Ababa, the commander of H.M.S. “ Dahlia ’ and the Acting Resident at Aden. The latter expressed readiness to organise** special intelligence for slave trade repression purposes subject to funds being provided and to a ruling as to whether it would be politically advisable to employ agents in French Somaliland. It is not known in Jedda how this matter stood at the end of the year, but at a meeting of various British authorities who were gathered at Addis Ababa for Ras Taffari s coronation in November 1930, the Political Resident at Aden held definitely that a service involving the employ ment of agents in French territory could not be organised at his post. It may be doubted whether Aden would in any case be the best centre. It may also be doubted whether it would be useful or desirable to employ, as Mr. Bond suggested, regular agents, who would necessarily be of a low and dangerous type, in Arabia any more than in French Somaliland. The question of a better intelligence organisation in some shape or form is nevertheless of capital importance. The sources of information are widely scattered and there is a great need for its being mobilised, co-ordinated and distributed by a capable officer at one centre, whether that centre be Aden, Perim or some other place. 181. It is even more difficult to pronounce, in the light of the imperfect information available at Jedda, on suggestions regarding arrangements with other Powers, notably France and Italy, for it would be impossible to make any useful arrangements with Arabian potentates. We already claim the right to go into their territorial waters, even though it has sometimes to be used with discretion for political reasons. In any case the commander of H.M.S. “ Dahlia has repeatedly urged that the most effective way of increasing naval pressure would be to patrol the neighbourhood of ports of embarkation, with freedom of entry into the adjoining territorial waters. It would appear to be desirable to review the reasons why, for instance, we were averse in 1924 from accepting Italian co-operation, the present value of the objections to seeking an arrange ment with both French and Italians for a reciprocal right of access to territorial waters, and incidentally the pros and cons of a possible exchange of intelligence with them. 182. Heads (e) and (/) of the prefatory analysis may be considered together. It has been said that it is impossible to estimate the extent to which the slave population of Hejaz-Nejd is kept up by importation. It seems improbable that there is any appreciable importation from original sources other than the parts of Africa close to the southern end of the Red Sea, although slaves of Asiatic origin may occasionally find their way in. The number of slaves brought across annually from Africa was roughly estimated in 1929 at about 1,000 persons, mostly children. The evidence for this figure is scanty and it has been suggested that it is exaggerated. Whatever the true figure, it seems probable that a large proportion of the slaves find their way into Hejaz-Nejd, where the demand is keen. It is much more difficult to determine by what routes the slaves are introduced. It seems clear that they are, in the first instance, run fairly straight across from the African coast in or near the straits of Bab-al-Mandab, the points of departure and arrival varying according to the exigencies of a situation requiring perpetual caution on the part of the slavers. What is doubtful is how exactly the further transport to the north is effected and at what places the slaves are finally landed. Mr. Bond’s information was to the effect that the small port of Medi, which lies somewhat indeterminately on the confines of Yemen and Asir, was an important, if not the chief, distributing centre, but that the distribution from there was by small dhows proceeding both south and north. He believed that arrangements existed at all ports of any size for the reception and disposal of the slaves. In June 1930 the commander of H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” understood from Arab sources that the slaves were brought by sea up the coast to Jizan, which had become the trading centre. 183. It seems certain that the process of educating Ibn Sand into a more modern attitude towards slavery must be gradual. The omens in 1930 were not propitious. Mr. Bond expressed the view in March that the King had done[5545] E 4 as/ 55 nothing to give effect to article 7 of the Treaty of Jedda. In July Fuad Bey Hamza assured Sir A. Ryan that he had done a good deal. He had, according to I'uad Bey, prohibited the entry of slaves into any of his ports, and this prohibition, if it exists and is enforced, presumably applies to Asir, where Ibn Baud is now master. Fuad Bey admitted the possibility of smuggling, but held that smuggling by sea did not account for any important number of slaves, and that, if any substantial numbers were, in fact, imported, they came overland from Yemen. He declared that Ibn Sand had taken action in this direction also, and that any person coming across the land frontier with a slave was compelled to produce a certificate, with photograph attached, that the slave had grown up in slavery. If this conversation proves nothing else, it proves that the King is conscious of a commitment. Should he ever think seriously of entering the League of Nations, he might possibly be induced to take effective measures. 184. There is no present hope, however, of inducing Ibn Saud to abolish slavery as an institution. It is doubtful whether he would dare to do so even if it suited his own book. He looks askance at the manumission of slaves by the British Legation. The majority of slaves so manumitted have to be repatriated to Africa. There were instances in 1930 of an obstructive attitude on the part of the local authorities in regard to the embarkation of freed slaves. Later in the year it was reported that measures had been taken to prohibit the movement of negroes in the interior without special permission. At best, the right of manu mission is of little practical value. The number of slaves who make their way to the Legation is small. It is thought politic to recognise the existence of an alleged understanding, the origin of which has not been traced, that the Legation will not concern itself with Royal slaves. The actual number of slaves manu mitted by the Legation since the year of the Jedda Treaty has been : in 1927, 36 male and 4 female; in 1928, 27 male and 12 female; in 1929, 15 male and 6 female; in 1930, 16 male and 11 female. The most that can be claimed is that the exercise of the right provides a way of escape for slaves who find their condition so intolerable that they surmount the difficulty of flying to the Legation; that it may serve as a bargaining counter in any future negotiations with Ibn Baud with a view to his taking stronger measures to suppress the trade; and that in places within easy reach of Jedda it perhaps creates a certain sense of insecurity of tenure in the minds of actual or would-be slave-owners. XII. —British Naval Position. 185. The previous section deals at length with the activities of the British Red Sea sloops in connexion with slavery. They serve two other purposes, the general one of “ showing the flag ” and maintaining prestige, and the particular one of combining some attempt to prevent illicit arms traffic with operations mainly directed to the repression of the slave trade. The rise of Ibn Saud and his jealousy of his sovereign rights has necessitated the consideration of sundry questions, which were not new in 1930 but were active throughout the year, notably (a) the position as regards visits to Hejaz ports; (b) the extent to which sloops should exercise right of search; and (c) naval salutes for Hejazi dignitaries. 186. It is traditional for the sloops to pay occasional visits to Red Sea ports. The question arising under this head is how far the practice can be kept up in its old form without risk of controversy with Ibn Saud, whose formal consent has not hitherto been asked for. The question has not been threshed out as one of principle, but during the last two or three years a practice has grown up of confining visits to Jedda, as each time the question of visiting other ports has arisen it has been held undesirable to make them. When a sloop intends to visit Jedda notice is given a few days beforehand without any request for consent. The Hejazi Government has not demurred to the visits except on one occasion in 1929, when they asked that a visit should be countermanded for reasons connected with the then situation. This request was agreed to in the circumstances, which were so unusual that this could be done without prejudice to the general position. It seemed probable in 1930 that, if other Hejazi ports56 were visited in the same way as Jedda, the Hejazi Government would object. In this event, it would be more difficult to acquiesce in the objection than it was on the special occasion in 1929, and insistence might raise a general question which would affect visits to Jedda. 187. In December 1930 the Admiralty raised with the Foreign Office the^ question whether visits to Jedda might not be made more frequently and visits to other ports in the Hejaz and Asir resumed. This question was under con sideration at the end of the year. It may he noted that the question of visits to Asir ports as distinct from those of the Hejaz proper presents certain features of its own owing to the peculiarities of the situation in regard to Asir. Visits to Jizan, for instance, might he held to have a special political significance in view of Ibn Saud’s practical annexation of Asir, and, if it were considered necessary to notify them in the same way as visits to Jedda, it might be difficult to know to whom the notification should be addressed. 188. The question of the extent to which the sloops should exercise the right of search was considered at an inter-departmental conference held at the Foreign Office on the 24th April. The subjects of discussion were how far the old practice of search for and seizure of illicit merchandise, whether slaves or arms, could he maintained (a) in Ibn Saud’s territorial waters and (b) in the case of dhows of Hejaz-Nejd nationality in any waters. The conclusion reached, subject to Admiralty reservations, as regards the Red Sea, was in effect that Hejazi and Asiri dhows should continue to be searched, both inside and outside territorial waters, and that they should be taken to a British port if found to contain slaves, but to be allowed to go free if found with arms only. It was suggested that the object of searches should not be specified unless it became necessary, in which case all searches should be represented as being for slaves only. The Admiralty, following up the reservations of its representatives, demurred strongly to any restriction of the old practice. The points at issue were still under consideration at the end of the year, when it was hoped that further light might be thrown on them in personal discussion early in 1931 between His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and the senior naval officer. It may be remarked that, while the reluctance of the Admiralty definitely to abandon the old practice is intelligible, the question is for practical purposes somewhat unreal, as the sloops rarely operate in Hejazi territorial waters, and no seizures of arms or slaves have been effected anywhere in the Red Sea for a considerable time. So far as arms are concerned, the danger of illicit traffic with the Hejaz is diminished by the fact that Ibn Saud, the principal importer, is perfectly free to get all the arms he wants openly. 189. The less importatit question of salutes for Hejazi dignitaries turns on how far the advantage of paying this flattering attention should be allowed to outweigh the application of restrictive general principles. In May 1930 the Legation put forward proposals, which were perhaps inspired more by the former than the latter consideration and which contemplated the giving of salutes, not only to Royal Princes, who would receive them in any case, but also to Ministers, Acting Ministers and Governors. The matter was still unsettled at the end of the year. In the meantime the Governor of Jedda, to whom it was desired to show special consideration, received a salute of thirteen guns in June as an exceptional measure. The matter would be even less important than it is but for the danger of a diversity of practice among British, French and Italian ships. Thus in July, when the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs visited an Italian sloop, he was accorded a salute variously estimated at seventeen or nineteen guns. Fortunately no occasion arose for his going on board a British sloop. If he had the omission of a salute would probably have been regarded as a slight. 190. No attempt is made to deal with the situation in the Persian Gulf regarding which the Legation in Jedda possesses very little information. XIII.— Miscellaneous Matters affecting British Interests. (1) Capitulations and the General Position of British Subjects. 191. The writer of this report knew Capitulations in their heyday in Turkey and attended their funeral at Lausanne. He met them in an outworn but still useful form in French Morocco. It is entertaining to come across them as a57 2 Six. completely disembodied ghost in the Hejaz. When the Treaty of Jedda was negotiated Tbn Sand wished for a formal renunciation. His Majesty’s Govern ment, though prepared to go far in the direction of practical abandonment, were unwilling to commit themselves explicitly. It was eventually agreed to add to Jlie second paragraph of article 5, which bound Ibn Saud to recognise the British Tatus of British subjects and protected persons in his territory, the words “it being understood that the principles of international law in force between independent Governments should be respected.” 192. This formula cuts both ways, but, in its bearing on the question of the Capitulations, it could hardly mean anything but that His Majesty’s Government would not claim extra-territorial jurisdiction for themselves or ex-territorial rights for their subjects in Hejaz-Nejd. The absence of an express renunciation might have some virtue in a changed future, but could have none so long as Ibn baud remained great and independent. The latter view was clearly expressed in a Foreign Office despatch to Jedda of the 3rd October, 1927. His Majesty’s Government, it said, no longer claimed capitulatory rights, but did not intend to make a formal statement to that effect. Their representative was to take no definite step indicating that they either regarded the Capitulations as being in force or had agreed to their abolition. In practice, he was to endeavour to settle cases between British subjects out of court, but he was to acquiesce in the exercise of local jurisdiction, if it were insisted on. This applied to criminal cases between British and local subjects, subject to discretion to protest orally or in writing in the interests of justice but without invoking the Capitulations. Even if both parties to a criminal case were British the same attitude was to be observed, though the Secretary of ^tate did not doubt that the Hejazi authorities would allow the agent to be’ present at the trial of British subjects, and that his presence and representations would probably ensure fair treatment. 193. I his despatch still governs the situation. No opportunity has occurred of testing the hope expressed at the end of it, for the British persons accused in criminal cases are not usually such that a request to be present at the trial would, in view of the delicacy of the matter, be justifiable. It is almost certain that, if such a request were put forward in the cases which arise, it would be resisted. In practice, respectable British subjects in the country are not molested in Jedda or to any serious extent in Mecca. Cases occasionally come to the notice of the Legation in which British subjects of lesser standing and British-protected persons are detained unduly long and sometimes maltreated in prison. There have been instances of beating, but none in recent times of the infliction of the extreme penalties allowed by Moslem law, such as the cutting off of the hand of a thief. In cases of very prolonged imprisonment or maltreatment, the Legation is sometimes able to bring influence to bear. It is probable that others escape its notice altogether. The situation is in principle deplorable, and a grave case might at any time arise. It would be difficult, however, to devise any attitude other than that which is observed at present, without precipitating a contentious question and possibly driving the Hejazi Government into conduct more arbitrary and more secret than they have practised of late. 194. One of the ways in which the Hejazi Government show their independence in exercising completely sovereign power is by deporting British subjects and protected persons whom they consider undesirable. Their practice in this respect is arbitrary, as there are few, if any, judicial safeguards, and they concern themselves very little with anything beyond embarking the victim and seeing, as far as possible, that he has such visas as will enable him to leave the ship at its port of destination. Fortunately there has been no recent case in which it could be urged that they were, in fact, using the right of deportation as a means of persecuting a blameless and respectable British subject. There was, howevei, one case in the latter part of 1930 in which a British Indian was apparently embarked at Jedda and dumped at Jizan. He subsequently made his way to Kamaran, where he came on the hands of the local administration as a destitute. At the end of the year the Legation was still investigating this case with a view to determining whether it called for protest on the ground that the man had been deported to an improper destination without any care being taken to ensure that he could return to his own country.(2) Law on Nationality. 195. Renewed attention was directed in 1930 to the question of the Hejazi Law on Nationality which was promulgated in 1926 and to certain provisions of which foreign Powers took exception. So far as Great Britain was concerned the matter had been more or less dormant since 1928, when the then British^ Agent, acting under instructions, drew attention to various features of the law which His Majesty’s Government would like to see altered, with a view to establishing (a) that the acquisition of Hejazi nationality by children born of British parents in the Hejaz should not take effect until they attained majority, and that they should then have a light of option; (b) that a clause in the law disallowing foreign nationality acquired by naturalisation without the consent of the Hejazi Government, whether before or after its promulgation, should be altered so as to apply only to persons naturalised British after that date; and (c) that a clause declaring persons not possessing papers of foreign nationality at the date of the promulgation of the law to be Hejazi, should be amended so as to enable such persons to prove their foreign nationality at any time. It was hoped that these matters might form the subject of an agreed exchange of notes, but the Hejazi Government did not pursue the matter on their side, and it was not urgent on the side of His Majesty’s Government. 196. A case arose early in 1930 in which the Hejazi Government asserted the Hejazi nationality of a deceased British Indian on behalf of whose heirs in India the Legation wished to intervene. There appeared to be no other reason for the assertion than that the man had for a very long period lived at Mecca, and it is more than likely that he had no British papers. This and certain other considerations suggested the desirability of re-opening the general question, whereupon it was discovered that the Hejazi Government were contemplating the issue of an amended law and wished to give some satisfaction to His Majesty’s Government, without, however, admitting that they were bound to consult any foreign Power as regards the text of a law to which it was within their sovereign rights to give any form they pleased. 197. The matter was the subject of informal conversations with the Acting Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs in the summer, but they produced no definite result, as the Legation wished before committing itself to obtain the guidance of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom on certain points revealed by further study of the question, notably the desirability or otherwise of pinning the Hejazi Government down to a definition of the territories in which the law, which in its 1926 form applied in terms only to the Hejaz, was intended to operate; and the extent to which any alleviation obtained on behalf of British subjects should be claimed equally on behalf of British protected persons. His Majesty’s Government had not decided these points up to the end of the year. (3) Protection. 198. Reference is made in the immediately preceding paragraph to the question of British protected persons. No difficulty arises in practice as regards persons of this kind of non-Arabian origin. It is much more difficult to define the situation as regards persons entitled to British protection on the ground of connexion by origin with Arab States in which His Majesty’s Government have a special position, like Iraqis, Kowaitis, Bahrainis and persons of Hadramaut origin. The matter has given rise to no acute controversy and has never been threshed out. The issues are in reality political rather than legal. So far as they are or might be legal, there are evidences of a conflict between European con ceptions of nationality and a vaguely stated Arab principle that allegiance depends on residence, more especially perhaps in the case of persons who have long sojourned in a territory other than that of their origin. Ibn Saud would probably like to assert this doctrine in the case of Arabs from other States residing in his dominions without conceding it in the case of his own subjects resident in other Arab States. 199. A concrete case which arose early in 1930 illustrates the curiousness of the position. There are numerous persons of near or remote Bahraini origin on the Hasa Coast. A number of them fled to Bahrain as a result of alleged oppressive taxation on the mainland. Matters were patched up and the refugees333 59 returned, some of them with Bahraini papers issued to such of them as were considered entitled to recognition as Bahraini nationals. Cases then arose of maltreatment and forcible seizure by the Nejdi authorities of the papers issued m Bahrain. In one case a man was stated to have been falsely imprisoned and beaten. 1 his man’s release was secured by local action, but His Majesty’s Blinister in Jedda was instructed in May to take up with the Hejazi Government the general question of securing for Bahraini nationals immunity from ill-treat ment and lespect for their papers. Various causes prevented Sir A. Ryan from carrying out these instructions before he went on leave in August. On his return in December it seemed advisable still to leave the matter in abeyance, pending developments in connexion with the Hejazi law on Nationality, and with the complex of Persian Gulf Questions described earlier in this Report. (4) British Claims against the Hejaz-Nejd Government. !20(). It is right to refer to these claims in the present section, but they are sufficiently dealt with in paragraph 118 owing to their bearing on the appreciation there given of the general financial situation. (5) Euro'pean Cemetery. 201. The only permanent European institution in the Hejaz, not being a foreign representative mission or a commercial establishment, is the European cemetery at Jedda, which presents a special interest from a British point of view. It consists of a desolate piece of ground enclosed by walls to the south of the town, half empty, half filled with perhaps a hundred graves, of which only about a fifth have anything to show who lies buried. It is or supposed to be the concern of four missions, the British, the French, the Dutch and the Italian. In the recent past one or other of them has been in charge of it. There are fortunately few deaths to stimulate interest; unfortunately no proper cemetery records, except an account book showing the proceeds of an occasional collect in the community and the expenditure, consisting mainly of the monthly wage of a native caretaker. 202. In June 1930 the Netherlands Legation, which had administered the cemetery for two or three years, invited the British Legation to take charge. There arose out of this transfer a suggestion that something should be done to place the cemetery on a sound basis, to see whether any improvements could be effected, to collect any available records of the past, and to ensure that future records should be kept. The heads of the four interested missions agreed to form themselves into a committee with the consent of any colonies they might have in Jedda. For climatic reasons, further local action was left until the winter, but some steps were taken towards elucidating the past history of the cemetery. 203. In August the Foreign Office produced a valuable memorandum which throws much light on the history of this derelict institution in a far country in which Europeans, unless they compel respect, still pass for “ Christian dogs.” It also stimulates regret that so little has been done locally in the past to preserve records. The uncertain history begins at an undefined moment between 1820 and 1860 when Mehmed Ali gave a grant of land. This was so ill-enclosed and crowded in 1860 that repairs and enlargement were necessary. The bodies of the British and French consuls and the Europeans killed in the Jedda massacre of 1858 had been thrown promiscuously into a trench by the sea. Interest was taken in the cemetery for some years. The British and French Governments contributed money, and a monument was apparently erected to the memory of the Europeans murdered in 1858. It is not known when this was done, but the monument, of which there is now no trace, was in existence in 1881, when the death of the Austrian vice-consul’s wife caused a new wave of interest and led to local action being taken to improve matters under the auspices of the Dutch consul. No record of anything subsequent to 1881 was discovered in the Foreign Office, except that in 1912 the Treasury agreed to a grant of £20 which had been refused in 1910, but permission could not be given to the then British consul to charge an annual contribution to public funds. It is possible that French and Dutch archives may produce some further information.60 204. Everyone in Jedda grows slack and some are over-burdened, but it is sincerely to be hoped that something will be done to wipe out what can only be considered a blot on the history of the European community. At best, it can only be a little, as any attempt to do much would probably be resented by the authorities and would make the cemetery a mark for marauders. '•V (6) Jedda Club. 205. This subject would not deserve mention in an annual report if the controversy regarding it had not had echoes outside the Hejaz. In 1929 certain Europeans in Jedda, the most energetic of whom was the then British consul and agent, conceived the idea of forming a club without a local habitation for purely recreational purposes, like the organisation of games and picnics and an annual evening gathering. The project encountered the violent and unrelenting hostility of Mr. Philby, who considered it useless, racially discriminatory, likely to antagonise the local authorities, and probably illegal. Himself a member of the Atheneum, he seemed to have some difficulty in conceiving a social club which would not lend itself, unless indeed the members were restrained therefrom by specific rules, to the use of “ alcohol, music, dancing, gaming and other inventions of the devil.” Incidentally, this was, perhaps, the first pronouncement of his in Jedda pointing to that belief in another world, to which he finally committed himself by entering the Wahhabi fold. 206. Nothing, except the energy of Mr. Bond, did more to promote the realisation of the project than Mr. Philby’s opposition. He sought to represent the Europeans and the Diplomatic Body of Jedda as being divided into two camps. There were in reality three—the promoters, Mr. Philby, with a young English couple whom he has befriended, and those who from indifference or caution stood aside. The club came into being and was as innocent as the day. A boat was bought. A necktie was designed. The implements of certain games were provided. A portion of the desert was earmarked as a golf course. It became possible for Jedda when playing cricket against a visiting ship to provide its own stumps and things instead of borrowing them from their guests. The bottles used to mark out the field and distinguish it from the rest of the desert were beer bottles, but there was no beer in them, nor were they emptied on any club occasion. The first annual dinner in 1930 was eaten to the accompaniment of soft drinks. As for racial antagonism, the club was, like all clubs, intended to bring together people with common interests and, while the rules were perhaps too exclusive in form, they produced no antagonism. The bulk of the Moslems of Jedda are less inclined to consort with Europeans than Europeans are to consort with natives. As for the Government, it would probably have known little of the project and cared less had it not been for Mr. Philby’s attitude. The Governor of Jedda expressed sympathy on being told of the project. 207. Mr. Philby suggested that the creation of the club should be postponed until the new British Minister should arrive. The promoters saw no reason for this and carried on. When the Minister did arrive, Mr. Philby strained every nerve to attach him to his cause. Sir A. Ryan considered that the only really material point was whether the club was an unlawful association, and waited for two or three weeks before joining it in order to give Mr. Philby every opportunity of proving his points, including this most important one. He declined Mr. Philby’s reiterated suggestion that he should consult the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, considering that, if the Government had a view, it was for them to express it, and that he could not put a question which would have been tantamount to asking the Minister whether he approved of his own joining a European club, innocent in appearance, which had come into being before he arrived. 208. Later in the year two discoveries were made. It appeared that there was buried in the file of the “ Umm-al-Qura ” (see paragraph 144) a regulation on companies and associations requiring a declaration to the Government. The difficulty of ascertaining the law of the Hejaz has been described; Mr. Philby himself had not been alert enough to unearth this regulation when he was challenged on the question of legality. The second discovery proved Mr, Philby i 1 i | r01 right on one point which was irrelevant when he made it. Once everyone had settled down after the controversy interest in the club waned. It became a question for consideration at the beginning of 1931 whether steps should be taken to bring it within the law. Ibn Saud would probably not object to it if the matter were put to him suitably, although the pilots of the Hejaz Air Force, after first ^jeing told by Fuad Bey Hamza that they might join, were afterwards told that it would be contrary to the King’s wish. It became doubtful, however, whether, if an application were made, the club would survive the growing lack of interest of its members. Jedda is like that. Appendix 1.
