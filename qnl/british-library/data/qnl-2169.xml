Company even objected to visit of Ham's Jewish head clerk and refused to let latter come back on Company's launch. Ham had received their approval of visit, (presumably reference is to head clerk) 3.

I do not consider Americans can take this amiss since establishment of a branch of the National City Bank of New York at Dhahran is primarily intended to handle American business employees of Oil Company. 2. Al Khobar is no doubt destined with increase of Oil Company 1 s activities to become principal port on East Coast of Saudi Arabia and as most of its developments will be conducted with India, Iraq, Iran and Trucial Sheikhdoms a branch of the Eastern Bank should fill a need which will grow as time goes on. If and when communications are ?made in Saudi Arabia they will undoubtedly touch coast at this point on account of market offering grounds for imports and internal produce.

I gathered that he was still in telegraphic pursuit of the elusive Abdullah bin Suliman through Abdullah al Fadhl. I told him I thought that this method of approach would be unlikely to achieve any result in the icmediate future. The value of time is unknown to the Arab and his leisurely progress can only be accelerated by pressure from above or the pros pect of personal advantage.

M.A.23.9.44;territory but for the protection of your own connect ions in Bahrain as well as the development of poten tialities in Arabia, our Directors tvish to take action before ccmpetHiors step in. They are pr^pa^e to goto some expense at the outset althou^ they naturally wish to keep this on a mod-rate scale.lt is the Inten tion that the Branch to be opened will be,as proposed by you,a Sub-Branch to Bahrain.Without knowledge of tha actual trade in the region and the Oil CoUfp ^nies* plans for development there we are not convinced fpom the co respopderice that A1 Khobar is the best jblace for a branch on the mainland and it m «y be thsst Ras Tanura,where we understana a refinery is to be built and where there will be anchorage for deep water steam ers, is the more suitable place, w* appreciate that only the man on the spot can judge as t &gt; this and you youiv self may have some doubts. For this reason therefore in opening at A1 Khoba our Directors do not wish you to commit the Bank to any permanent unnecessary expense in case it may be found advisable to close the aub- Branch there and‘open instead at Ras Tanurs. You should ccetnenca enquiries and negotiations with a view to arranging the requisite prenDlses accom modation at the point which you consider to be the moat suitable for the new Bub-Branch without makin any definite com itment before receipt of the Saudi Arabian Governments permission. Having regard to your recommenda tion that at the outset you will need a senior clerk from one of our Branches end n junior clerk from the mainland we think in all the circumstances that it would be undesirable to iastal a Jew or a Hindu there end you should therefore make secret enquiries from other Branch Managers as to the possibility of engaging n reliable Christian or Muslim for the post. The staff must not be allowed to have any knowledge of our pi a ns .Meantime you can be thinking of whnt stationery,equipment,safes etc.you will have to order from India after permission to open has been- received and we should like you to give us also some indication of the probable annual charges account of the Sub-Branch. l/rN/P/17361 of S.9.44.
