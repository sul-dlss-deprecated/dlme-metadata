I hare the honour to refer to jour endorsement No. 1523 dated trie 2nd July and to say that Mr. Chablani is a man of bad character and dissolute habits. 2. When he left for India last year the Adviser wrote to me and said that from reporta received from the Polic&lt; and other sources he was of the opinion that it was most un desirable/ that he should return to Bahrain. 3. He mentioned that he was a notorious drunkard, that he incited people to act contrary to the wishes of Govern ment andthat he had encouraged strikes. In addition he stirre( up trouble between merchants, and, that though an employee of the Eastern Bank ( who discharged him ) he occupied part of hi* time in composing complaints against the Government. 4. I requested the Commissioner in Sind not to give him a visa to return to Bahrain and he has therefore refuj ed him one. Shortly after his departure a decree for a small amount was given against him in the Agency Courts and in reply to his letter I informed him that if he wished any action takei regarding property he might have left, he could appoint an agent for the purpose. He has replied to this by letters in which he accuses members of the Agency and Adviser’s staff of offences, with threats of disclosures if his requests are not accededacceded to* , , 5 .

I most respectfully Tneg to lay down the following few lines before your honour, trusting that the same shall meet with your kind and favourable consideration. Sir, from the enclosed copy of my letter dated 24th October last addressed to H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrein, your honour will see that I first went to Bahrein in the employment of ihe eastern Bank Limited, Bahrein, in the year 1925 and remained in cheir service till the end of October, 1929, when I resigned for the reasons explained in the enclosures forwarded with my abovementioned letter dated 24th ultimo (October last) addressed to H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrein. Sir, after I had left Bahrein, I was informed by the local Government here i.e. The Commissioner-in-Sind that they had received a complaint against me from the Political Agent, Bahrein and hence they called for my Pass-Port and cancelled same. On this, I communicated with the Commissioner-in-Sind for the nature of the complaint they had received from the Political Agent, Bahrein, but they would not tell me anything in the matter. On this I requested the Political Agent, Bahrein, to very kindly inform me about the reasons of the cancellation of my Pass-Port, but I was not told anything in the latter. I was also not very particular at that time to go to Bahrein, as will be seen from the copy of my letter dated 24th October last (enclosed herewith or your honour's perusal), but had always in mind to clear up my conduct as this was a serious blot against my character,because in case I wished to go to any foreign country, there shall always be a hitch in the grant of Pass-Port to me. In fact I was in Basra for a period of 15 months and have returned to Karachi on the 19th ultimo, because the- 2 - o business there also was rather very dull and we could hardly make the two end meet. Side hy side, I knew Major Holmes, Consulting Engineer of The Eastern and General Dyndicate Ltd, since 1925 i.e. from the very time I went to Bahrein in the service of The Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrein, as Major Holmes k’liaw my character and everything elsOf I approached him to help me and he promised me some time in the end of April last i.t-. *hen he was proceeding to London, that he would do some-* thing for me on his return. This gentleman returned from London in October last and I then had an occasion to meet him at Basra and remind him of his promise and he again assured me that he would do something for me when he visited Bahrein. Then Major Holmes went to koweit and from there direct Bahrein and I forwarded him my application to the Political Agent to he kindly forwarded to him and arrange for the necessary NO In fact I did not leave Basra on the 3lst October as originally contemplated by me, so on the 12 th ultimo I wired him at Bahrein as under:- KM. MAJOR HOLMES, BAHREIN. ' tfHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT MY COMING THE RE 11 INTEND PROCEEDING TO INDIA FOURTEENTH GIVE' ^ ASSISTANCE - CHABLANI. - During the interval I left Basra and did not get any reply from him and on the 16 th ultimo i.e. after my departure a cable was received in Basra, which was forwarded to me by post Karachi * / reading as under:- CHABLANI CARE LALWANI, BASRAH. 'TWELVETH WILL CABLE YOU WITHIN A WEEK’S TIME-HOLMES'. I was awaiting for a further information from Major Holmes and it was only yesterday that I received a letter from his Assistan (copy of which is enclosed herewith for your honour's perusal). from this letter, your Honour will Bind that although Major Holmes is still prepared to help me and the Adviser to the Bahrein Covemment (C. Dalrymple Balgrave, Esq) has also no objection to my going to Bahrein, yet H.B.M's Political Agent does not wish my return to Bahrein. Although I have no right to 0 —,^ OIlnlonoBtte4ecisjonof ^^_ s ^yet azn of the opinion that in case, he has once passed orders for the cancellation of my Pass-Port, he himself would never like to change his own decision* For your Honour*s informa tion, I may state here, that there have 'been many instances in which Pass-Ports of people have been cancelled for evert certain Political reasons, hut on a re-consideration of the matter, the| same authorities have changed their decision and granted Pass-Ports to them. In this connection I am enclosing herewith a cutting from the 'SIND OBSERVER', printed at this place to corohorate my statement. This has appeared only on the 9th instant i.e. yesterday* I do not claim this as a precedent, hut only wish to bring it to the notice of your honour. Now as a humble loyal subject of His Majesty the King Emperror, I appeal to your Honour to very kindly look into my case and grant me the necessary N O OBJECTION CERTI FTate, in consultation with H.B.M # s Political Agent, Bahrein,(Captain Prior), to enable me to proceed over there at Bahrein, in company with my wife and son. For your Honour*s information, I might state here that before uhen I was at Bahrein, I was a single man. I am prepared to give any undertaking, which may be required by H.B.M*s Political Agent, Bahrein and this I have already stated in my petition to him dated 24th October last. I am sure your Honour would never wish that any humble loyal subject of His Majesty the King Bmp error should be deprived of his bread - more specially in these hard times, when there is scarcity of everything in India and all over the World. I do not wish to make this appeal of m^ne very lengthy, but once again request your Honour to have jbity on my case and grant me the m_OBJB CTION CERTIFICATE , to enable me to earn my honest living, for which act of kindness, I shall ever remain grateful and pray for your Honour’s long life and prosperity. I beg to remain Sir Yoir Copy of letter dated 30th November, 1931 from Mr.Ashraf, Assistant to Major Frank Holmes, Bahrein, to Mr. D.F.Chablani, 0/0 The Royal Stores, Karachi. * Bear Mr. Chablani, Your telegram (pre-paid) of the 12th to Major F.H. was reached in time, hut there being no occasion either before or immediate after receipt of same to have talks about your matter with party concerned, Major could not reply you promptly, however on the 15th of Nov. reply was sent to Basrah wordings of which was as under:- 'WILL WIRE WITHIN A WEEK' After wiring you as above and since that date until last night there happened to have special talks on frequent occasions in your matter with F.A. and Major was all the time persistent to have the standing order cancelled but • at last he failed, and he is very sorry that now no more he fean do in the matter.

Sir, nth due respects I most respectfully beg to lay flown the following few lines, trusting same shall meet with your Iciiid and favourable consideration. Sir, I first oame to Bahrein in the service of The Eastern Ban* Limited, Bahrein, on a contract of I3 nonths, but when that ne-iod h*d expired, I wan brought on a permanent establishment. After having served the Bank for £b° ut 3© months, I was granted leave in October, 1927 and returned to duty after 3 months. After about 22 month? after my return from leave, T applied for s month and half’s leave (ns per cony of my letter date^ 26 th October, 1929 enclosed herewith for your soods.lf’g u.rusal), but a. I was refused easw, I had r© other Rlterestlve at that time but to resier. Vj resignation was aocsoted by the then manager of the Bank ” r * (original letter enclosed herewith). ’Then I had put in my resignation, my Intention was to return back to Bahrein after my marrlag. and start my own husln.es, as I was •ure to hav. ths backing of almost every on., a. i was always in good books with all. To »y great astonishment, after about a month's arrival at Karachi. I was informed by th. Government- 2 - 7 authorities, that my Fass-port had hseu canoellsd, as thsy had received a complaint against me from your good self. When I left Bahrein In the year 1929 after having resigned fcy Job In the Eastern Bank Limited, I had left all my belongings In a rented house, because ray Intention was to return back and do my ora business as stated above. Oa ree-iet of the Information of tue cancelation of my Faes-port, T communicated with your goodself on the subject, but was mot given any reasons as to why a renort was made against ns. In fact I was not very much interested In Bahrein at that tine, yet T had s -*nd to clear my conduct r.r it was r serious blot against ny charscter, and which I am sure, your icodself would admit ro self respecting man *owld wish. At any rate I was not given any reasons nor was allowed an opportunity to clear my conduct. After all I Obtained ray Pass -port for Basra and cars over here, as ,, aephsv had his business over hers since the time of War. Here r would Ilka to mention Hum., 3lr, that during mv etay of about 5 T&lt; ' ’ 8 lH 3ahr ' 1n i-’- r™ 1925 to the end of 1929 , I never save cause to any one to make a«y „rt of complaint against mo.

At any rate ~ although X do not know the real reasons of the cancellation of my Pass-Port, I most respect fully beg to tender my un-coriditional apology for all that may hov e been agld against me and have every hope, that your good self would accent same.

Ac^^ng on the Above information the IbliticE 1 MVed the Commissioner in Sind not to give Mr.^uabia^i a visa if he attempts to return to Bahrain. 4. He has since °ppliea on several occasions for permission to come to Bahrain,both direct and through the Hon ,M c the Political Resident. The last occasion when he applied through the P.R was in January 1932 and Captain Prior informed the Secretary in reply 'I am still the opinion that his return to Bahrain would be undesirable.' 5. He now requests that if the ban on his coming to Bahrain cannot be removed,it should at least be removed so en°ble him to get a passport to proceed elsewhere. This Agency is only interested so far a~ his coming to r^rain is concerned and unless he ^as done something elsewhere there does not seem to b^ any objection to his getting a visa for any other part of the world. l*' i &gt;l Submitted. 1 fVT’yv*- Vv^vwO»Letter dated the 28th -^pril 1935 from Mp.
