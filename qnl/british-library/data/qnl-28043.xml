Meetings are said to have been held in Bagdad Kerbela and elsewhere with this in view and suitable persons chosen for job. 2. Report states that owing to Saudi-Arabian Government's refusal to allow overland pilgrimage thev may come by sea from Persian Gulf or India and adds that British subjects are being chosen in order to embarrass Saudi-Arabian Government as much as possible. 5. I am of course unable to confirm this report but anything which can be done to discourage prominent Shiahs from travelling will be all to the good. Alleged ringleaders will probably be refused permission to land if they do come. 4. List of names of persons alleged to be involved follows by air bag. Foreign Office please pass to Bagdad, to Tehran as my telegram No. 3 and to Government of India as my telegram No. 76.

Saudi Arabian Minister called on me yesterday and read out the statement about the 'Haram' incident which followed the general lines of paragraph 3 of Jedda despat ch No, 6 of e/*.. January 16th, 2, Regent, whom I saw later, did not appear excited over the affair. He thought however that it was a mistake to have dealt with the man so harshly and summarily. He took the view that if the incident had happened at Medina [gip. undeo: ? immediate] action would have been necessary but Kaaba had not the same sanctity and it would have been better to have given the offender a proper trial. 3. Some indignation continues to be expressed amongst Iraqi Shiahs but so far they have taken no corporate action, Mujtahids of the Holy Cities are apparently hesitant and there seems to be a fair chance that the whole affair will blow over, [Copies sent to Mr, Smyth], fLf^'^D SECRET r HLjE COPY ^ .
