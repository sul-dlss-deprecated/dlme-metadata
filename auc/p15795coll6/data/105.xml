(1213-1216 H.), but the hardships and resistance they have faced during their work, in addition to their ignorance of the Arabic language misled them to put the Arabic names on the right locations. All that lead to various mistakes in the French map and the maps that copied from it until we produced this map.
Therefore, Khedive Ismail of Egypt, ordered me “Mahmoud Bey al Falaky” to draw a new map with the needed corrections. As the needed cartographic tools were not available at the time, I resorted to the astronomical coordinates.
The map was finished in 1287 H. representing all the cultivation and urbanization that has been implemented upon the orders of the khedive on that year."
