Dear Rumbold, NW^vu^v We have in the past allowed Messrs. Hawkers to use the diplomatic bag to and from Tehran for communication with their representatives there, who until recently were employed in the Tehran aircraft factory. Most of Hawkers* men have v now left Persia, including Knight, their senior X, representative, who now has a post in the Civil Aviation Directorate at Simla. Jones, of Hawkers, has forwarded the enclosed letter for transmission to Knight, being apparently under the impression that we can forward corres pondence to him in India as we did when he was in Persia. If the India Office can agree to allow Hawkers to send correspondence to Knight with their official mail, we will so inform Jones and ask him to send his letters for Knight under cover to you. Hitherto, Jones* corresponaence with Knight has not been unduly frequent or bulky. It is of course subject to confidential scrutiny. Yours sincerely. H.A.F.
