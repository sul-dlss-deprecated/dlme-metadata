Shaikh Mubārak's desire for Kuwait to formally be made a British Protectorate is discussed in detail.The file contains a number of reports (in their original Arabic with English translations attached) concerning political affairs in Kuwait that were written by Ali bin Ghulam Reza [‘Alī Ghulām Riḍā] , a news agent in Kuwait employed by the British. Many of these reports are addressed (in Arabic) to Hajji Abbas bin Muhmmad bin Fadhil, a munshi employed by the British in Bahrain and it appears that he translated the reports into English.The file also contains correspondence that discusses the rivalry and conflict between Shaikh Mubārak and the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the Rashidi tribal dynasty, Abdul Aziz Ibn Mitab [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Mit‘ab], in addition to correspondence regarding Russian intentions towards Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001bf#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001bf#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001bf#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
