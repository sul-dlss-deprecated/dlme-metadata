Wifi, tlik last reauisition the Maharanee has at last complied. » t , .f tj ij irrlinfcc however long deferred, as an friendly relations between the two States.[ 31 ] It could not but be felt, that while the late occurrences at Gwalior were an offence to the British Go* vernment, they at the same time created new insecurity to its subjects residing on the frontier. The want of cordial co-operation on the part of the officers of the Gwalior State in the maintenance of order upon the frontier, had long been a subject of just remonstrance, and various orders had been issued by the late Maharaja in accordance with the representations of tl)e British Resident. These orders had but too often remained without due execution; but, in consideration of the long illness of His Highness, and of the consequent weakness ot his administration, the British Government had not pressed for satisfaction with all the rigor which the importance of the subject would have warranted. It knew the good disposition of the late Maharajah, and was willing to attribute his failure to effect what was right, to the want of Power l ather than of Will. But the recent occurrances at Gwalior, and the changed spirit in which the administration has been con ducted, no longer permit the continuance of this forbearance. The British Government must now peremp torily insist upon the adoption of permanent measures for the establishment of 'order upon the frontier, and for the future security ofjts subjects. The British Government has so long deferred intervention in the distracted affairs of the Gwalior State, in the sincere hope that the Chiefs themselves would establish, in supercession of the disgraceful rule to which they have recently submitted, an administration willing and able to satisfy its reasonable demands and to maintain the accustomed friendly relations between the two States. The British Government can neither permit the existence of an unfriendlv Government within the ter ritories of Scindiah, nor that those territories should be without a Government capable of coercino- it, own subjects, and of maintaining every where the relations of good neighbourhood with the subjects of the Bri tish Government and its Allies. The deplorable events which have last occurred, at Gwalior, the hostile conflicts in the Camp before the palace of the Maharaja, and the practical suspension of all Government in His Highness' territories now impose upon the British Government the duty of intervention, not solely for the security of British' inte rests, but for the execution, according to its true spirit and intentions, of the solemn engagement of a Treaty. By the Treaty of Boorhanpoor contracted with the Maharaja Dowlut Rao Scindiah, the British Go vernment engaged to maintain a force to be at all times ready on the requisition of the Maharaja, to protect the person of the Maharaja, his heirs and successors, to overawe and chastise rebels or exciters of disturbance in His Highness territories, and to reduce to obedience all offenders against his Highness' authority. to rrcl e h r Govern merit s st ''f' 0 ' 'v'® 'T™', Mal ' ara J a ^nder it impossible for him to address ; i M • ' in eut such formal lequisitions for aid as circumstances would iustifv him in demand sistenl'titrihe Cd f.dh' 1 '''' - ,lie l' r ; | ,visio ' s | oftl 'e Treaty of Boorhanpoor; hut it would he incon- sis lent with the oocJ faith and injurious to the good name ot the British Government were it to nermif Ihis inability to demand aid, which only gives the Maharaja new claims upon its protection to deprile His Highness of that friendly support in its utmost need which it was the intention of MaSia DoIlTB o Scmdhia to secure for ever by that Treaty, to himself, his heirs, and successors ,,0wlut Kao The Governor General will therefore direct the immediate advance offerees amply sufficient to efferf all the just purposes of the British Government—to obtain guarantees for the future security of its own subjects on the common frontier of the two States, to protect the person of the Maharaja, to quell distur bances within His Highness territories, and to chastise all who shall remain in disobedience. By order of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India, F. CURRIE, Secy, to the Govt, of India, with the Governor General. Camp Hinr/onah, the ttth December, 1843. The British army has entered the Territory of Scindiah, not as an Enemy, but as a Friend to the Maharajah, bound by reaty to protect His Highness' person, and to maintain his Sovereign authority against all who are disobedient and disturbers of the Peace. The Governor General has no object but that of seeing re-established in the Territories of Scindiah a strong Government, willing and able to preserve the accustomed relations of Friendship with the British Government and its Allies, a Government which may at all times do justice to the army as well as to the people, but command both for the good of all. r The Governor General cautions the evil advisers of the Maha Ranee, that they will themselves be held responsible for any resistance which may be offered to the measures deemed to be necessary for the esta blishment of the Maharajah's just authority, and for the security of his person and rights. • Hy order of the Right Hon'ble the Governor General of India, F. CURRIE, Secy, to the Govt, of htdia, with the Governor General.(s) n ( 32 ) Camp Hinyonah, 27/A December 184-3» The British Annies have entered the dominions of Scindiah as the Friends and Allies of the Maharjah whose person and whose rights the British Government is bound by treaty to protect. The British Government desires only to establish the just authority of the Maharajah over all his sub- cts, and to place upon firmer and permanent foundations that/rienship between the two States, which, for eir mutual benefit, has existed so long, and which, not the British Government, but the evil disposed .dvisers of the Maha Ranee have now interrupted. The British Government knows only as enemies those who oppose its armies, and are disobedient to the Maharajah and disturbers of peace. The Armies will regard and treat as friends all peaceful Cultivators and Traders. They will pay for all .supplies brought to the Camp, give compensation for all injury unintentionally done to property, and injure no one but such as act hostilely l ' A strong Government having been established at Gwalior, capable of maintaining the Maharajah's autho- ty over all, and willing as well as able to preserve tranquillity on the common frontier, the British Armies ill return to their own territory.

And here I must do justice to the gallantry of their opponents, who received the shock withoutflm ching; their guns doing severe execution as we advanced, but nothing could withstand the rush of British soldiers Her Majesty's 39th foot, with their accustomed dash, ably supported by the 56th regiment native infantry drove the enemy from their guns into the village, bayonetting the Gunners at their posts. Here a most santJuinarv conflict ensued, the Maratta troops; after discharging their matchlocks, fought sword in hand with the most deter Timed courage. General Valiant's brigade, with equal enthusiasm, took Maharajpoor in reverse, an d 28 guns were captured bv this combined movement : so desperate was the resistance, that very few of the defenders of this very strono- no' sition escaped. During these operations Brigadier Scott was opposed by a body of the enemy's cavalry on the extreme lett, and made some well executed charges with the 10th light cavalry, most ably supported by Oaptai n Grants troop of horse artillery and 4th lancers, capturing some guns and taking two standards; thus thereaten- ing the right flank of the enemy. mcreaieu In conformity with the previous instructions, Major General Valiant, supported by - he 3d cavalry brigade mov ed on the right of the enemy's position at Chonda.

With the two lio-ht field batfp- nes, 1 have every reason to be pleased : they well supported the high character of the Bengal artillery? * I was greatly gratified with a spirited charge made by Major Oldfield, C.

It may therefore be necessary here to observe, that, on finding that all your Lordshio's strenuous atteB.pts to maintain those friendly relations, which had hitherto existed between the two Governments were fruitless ; and that the Mahratta army, the ruling power, appeared determined to rest the fate of their coun try on the hazard of a general action, I instructed Major General Grey, with the troops .under his command to push on as rapidly as practicable to Punmar, 12 miles south west of Gwalior ; thus placing the Mahratta armv between two corps capable of supporting each other, should it remain in the vicinity of its capital or of subdivid mg that army to repel or attack these two columns.

The enemy as it! afterwards appeared) marched from the Antree Pass early on the morning of yesterday by a parallel movement with the left wing, concealed behind a lofty and extensive range of hills, some miles distant on our right, and took up a strong position on the heights in the immediate vicinity of the fortified village of Mangore, near Punniar and commenced firing on my immense line of baggage. I immediately detached all the cavalry 1 could spare under Brigadier Harriott, and an addition of a troop of horse artillery under Captain Brind, which on approaching the baggage on the other side of the town of Punniar, took up a position, and relumed the fire of'the enein&gt; with much precision and effect. Every attempt was made by Brigadier Harriott to attack the enemy, but from the ground being intersected by ravines, this able officer was prevented from bringing the cavalry into action and proceeded with them to the rear guard, having passed under a smart cannonade/ About 4 o'clock p m the enemy was observed to have taken up a very strong position on a chain of high hills, 4 miles to the east of oui camp. I decided immediately to attack him, and detached Her Majesty's 3rd buffs and a company of sappers and miners to take up a position on an opposite ridge, followed afterwards to the right by the 39th reaiment native in fantry, consisting of 5 companies, until I could brim; up the force, amounting to 2007 men, and then make an at tack upon the enemy's left fiank and centre, and drive him from the strong position he occupied; owing to the lateness of the day, jt was some time before I could support the force I had detached. The buffs and sappers at tacked the enemy's centre, exposed to a galling fire from their guns, but most gallantly carried every position be fore them, drove the enemy from height to height, and captured 11 of his guns and the standard. I cannot suffici ently express how much indebted I feel to Lieutenant Colonel Clunie, who commanded the buffs for the '-allant and judicious manner he took his regiment into action, and overcame all obstacles. The wing of the 30thnative iutautMM»tUk Brigadier Y ates, was comlncted to the crest of a hill commanding the enemy's left, and after pourin* in a destructive fire, rushed down on him, and on approaching the nullah below was-exposed to a heavy fire»'-o m two guns, which they captured. Brigadier Yates, and Major Earle, commandinsr the 39th native infantrv, both wounded at this place, and 1 have to thank them for the manner in which the battery was carried. The 2d infantry brigade, undei the cammand of acting Br igadier Anderson, K. H. Her Majest „ reff i. went, arrived in tim.^ to put a finish to the action, and tormed on the crest of the hill, and by a judicious movement attacked the enemy's left and completely defeated him, taking the rer.aiuuer guns. I have to r«turn my thanks to Major White, who commanded the 50th native infantrv * the 2d infantry brigade out of action, B igadier Anderson, K, H. (being wounded. Major Petit, com manding Her Majesty's 50th regiment, distinguished himself by the gallant charge d iwn the hill he' nude at the head ot his regiment. A wing ot the 50th native infantry was posted with the main battery of horse ar- tilltry which attacked the enemy's right, and the remainder accompanied the brigade. The 5«ih native imantrv supported Her Majesty's 50th regiment, under the command of captain Parker, who led his regiment i nto much to his credit. ^ I( 41 ) Brigadier Biddulph, with 6 horse artillery guns, much distinguished himself by the manner he disposed of his bat tery, which silenced those of the enemy on the right, and committed great havock ; he was assisted by Major Ged- ties, commanding the brigade of horse artillery, and by Captain Campbell, commanding the troop, whose fire on the enemy was particularly effective. Lieutenant Olpherts, with 4 guns N'o. 16 light field battery, took up a position south of Mangsre, and opened on the enemy's centre as he retreated up the hills. Lieutenant Tombs, attached to the rear guard, with 2 guns of no. 16 light field battery, fired several shots with great precision and effect on the ene* nay's left. 1 feel indebted to Miyor Fitzgerald, of the llth cavalry, who commanded the rear guard, for bringing up the whole ot tne stores and baggage of the army into camp this morning. Brigadier Stubbs, with the Sippree contingent under his command, moved out of his camp near Punniar in the evening, at my request, to occupy the heights at the scene of action, to enable ma to withdraw the force that had been engaged 2 hours with the eueray, 4 miles from camp, after a fatiguing imrch of 16 miles. This morning the sappers an J miners and i squadrons of the 8tn irregular cavalry joined the contigent, who were fired upon by a^partv of the enemy. A few shots from the contingentartillery cleared the ground and silenced the eneny's only guu, and enabled Captain Christie, with the 8th irregular cavalry, to follow the broken enemy. I beg to draw your Excellency's particular atteufion to the very valuable services I derived from Lieutenant Colo nel Parsons, Deputy Commissary General, on all occasions, but more especially in the field yesterday. I have to thank Lieutenant Counningham, Field Engineer, who turned on the enemy the guns first captured by the 3d buffs and Lieutenant Maxwell, commanding the company of sappers, for their exertions, and for bringing the captured truns into camp over great local impediments. 0 0 B The conduct of Brevet Captain G. fleid, Assistant Quarter Master General, who accompanied the buffs into action and by his gallantry rendered me the greatest service, merits my warmest approbation; I have also to brine to vour Excellency s notice, the able assistance I derived from Captain Guyon, Deputy Assistant Adjutant General and also from my Aid-de-Camp Captain Tudor, Her Majesty's 5Uth regiment, whom I particularly beg to recommend to vour Excellency. The enemy's loss was most severe, but from tlie action closing at nightfall, many of his killed and wounded were car ried off during the night, and it is difiienk to form a correct estimate of his loss; all his wounded found on the field were brought into camp this morning, and are under medical treatment. Owing to the strength of the enemy's position and the number of his guns, I regret to say that our loss has also been My best, thanks are due to all the troops emploved on this occasion, for their unflinching steadiness under heavy cannonade, and the conspicuous gallantry with which they stormed the enemy's strong position. A portion of the 1st cavalry brigade under Brigadier Campbell, K. H. accompanied the force aa far as the ground would admit, but £ regret that an opportunity was not afforded for actively employing them. Rrevet Major Mainwarlng, and captain C.

The evil advice of ill disposed persons considering only their own interest, and not the good of the Gwalior State, and the resolution of the Gwalior Array, over-confident in its strength, to endeavour to preserve the ad vantages it derived from its power over the Government of Sindia have led to two battles between the British I Forces and those of Gwalior, deeply to be lamented on account of the loss of brave Men mutuully sustained, but having for their result the secure establishment of British supremacy. 2. The Governor General successful in the Field has adhered to the principles upon which the intervention of British Government in the affairs of the Gwalior State was from the first based. He has only used the power ■which victory has placed in his hands to carry into effect the necessary measures for securing the future tranquil lity of the common frontier of the two States, for establishing the just authority of the Maharajah's Government, and for providing for the proper exercise of that authority during His Highness 1 minority. 3. A Treaty calculated to effect these legitimate objects and confirming former Treaties, has this day been sign ed by the British Plenipotentiaries and the Council of Regency, and ratified by the Governor General, and His Highness the Maharaja Jyajee Rao Sindia. 4. The accustomed friendly relations between the British Government and the Gwalior State are now restored, and the British Armies will immediately return to their own Provinces.
