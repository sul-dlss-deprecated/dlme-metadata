In my memorandum of last August I explained that the vacancies in the permanent Foreign Service were being filled (a) through the Reconstruction Examinations, candidates for which had to be under 30 on August 1st, 1945# and (b) by establishing a limited number of people over that age who had worked for us during the war in a temporary capacity or were certified by our Representative abroad, who had knowledge of their work, to be suitable as permanent members of the Foreign Service. As regards (a), (the Reconstruction Examinations), we have a large number of candidates drawn from a wide field* The great majority naturally come from the Services and many have distinguished war records. Reports received from Heads of Departments in the Foreign Office on the entrants who hcve already started work here have been uniformly favourable and there is no doubt that the new recruits are of a high all round standard. The Reconstruction Examinations are of course entirely different from the pre-war system. They consist of a qualifying written examination, followed by the G.I.S.S.B. ’’country house” tests and an interview before a final Selection Board. The qualifying written examination is needed to ensure that recruits have the brains to do the work of the Service but apart from this the C.I.S.S.R. tests and the interview are designed to bring out qualities of character, personality and general suitability for work as a Representative abroad. Results prove that they have been successful in doing so and under this system the man with purely academic qualifications is eliminated. The first of these examinations began last August; the second has been completed, the third is now under way, and the fourth and fifth will be held in July and November* From the first two examinations we have secured 52 candidates and from the remaining three to be held this year it is estimated by the Civil Service Commission that we shall get 107 more, (apart from reservists), of whom 32 should be available in July, 45 in September and 30 about the end of January; making a total by that date of at least 159 new recruits from the Reconstruction Examinations* As regards (b), (men over 30) we hrve brought in 20 men, selected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Government White Paper on Recruitment, after appearing before a special Foreign Service Selection Board* A number of women are now sitting for the current examination and we may expect to get the first women recruits shortly* Apart from the above a very considerable number of men have been engaged on a temporary basis for work in all branches of our Missions and Consular posts abroad. Training/Training 2# A separate section has been set up in Personnel Department to handle Training. It deals with: (a) Refresher courses * Under this scheme Foreign Service Officers from all parts of the world are 'brought home by air at public expense under specially favourable financial arrangements, to bring themselves up to date on affairs at home and thus make themselves better interpreters and salesman of Britain abroad. Since the beginning of this year the main emphasis has been on export trade. Programmes for the courses are co-ordinated with the Export Promotions Department of the Board of Trade. Officers work in that Department for two or three v/eeks and then tour the country studying specific industries. (b) Oxford V/eek-ends . This year arrangements have been made for three special week-end refresher courses at Oxford. These cater for 20 officers at a time. They hear talks by exports and leading figures in the political, university and Civil Service worlds on important topics of current interest in Great Britain and the Empire and take part afterwards in informal discussion. The main theme of the first course is to be ’’The changed functions of Government in Great Britain today”. Among the political speakers are to be Hr. Hector McNeil# Mr. Ernest Davies and Mr. Woodcock, Secretary of the Research Department, T.U.C. (c) Initial Training. New Entrants into the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service are given a lecture course of a month 1 s duration dealing generally with the history and work of the Foreign Service and its place in the Government machine. The first was given last November and the second will start shortly. Meanwhile two intensive ten-week courses in French have boen completed for those new entrants vhose French was not up to standard and a third is due to start on the 8th July. A ’’Foreign Offiee Guide” (describing the organisation and methods of work of the Foreign Office) and a “Foreign Service Handbook” (Describing the structure, history and conditions of service of the Foreign Service) have been completed. These, together with other documents of general utility, are supplied to new entrants to all Branches of the Foreign Service. Lectures and refresher courses on the working of the Foreign Office Registry have been given to new entrants, to Foreign Service officers returning to the Foreign Office from the Forces, to clerical officers on promotion and to new temporary clerks. (d) The Middle East Centre for Arab Studies at Jerusalem, This Centre was set up on the initiative of the Foreign Office two years ago. 30 men are given a thorough grounding over a 12 months course in Arabic and associated political, economic, social and religious studies. Results have been very satisfactory. The next course is due to start on the 1st September. Amalgamation/AnalgpjnGtion r\ foo © 3* Araalganation nay now be regarded as conpleted so far as selection of personnel is concerned. The principle of the best nan for the job irrespective of his service ancestry is now always applied. For example three former consular officers have recently been appointed to important political posts, namely Mr. Dening, Assistant Under-Secretary in the Foreign Office supervising Far Eastern Departments, Mr. Helm as British Political Representative in Hungary and Mr. MacKereth, first as Deputy to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in the Dutch East Indies and now as Consul-General in Batavia. Over 100 former consular officers are now employed in the various departments of the Foreign Office, v/hile a substantial number of others are employed on political work at our Missions abroad. Consular officers at foreign capitals now hold diplomatic rank. On 1st April, 1946 the Foreign Office became responsible for commercial diplomatic personnel and we now fill commercial diplomatic vacancies as they arise from the ranks of the Foreign Service as a whole while former commercial diplomatic officers are similarly considered for vacancies at diplomatic and consular posts. So far as Foreign Publicity is concerned the Foreign Office, has, similarly, since the 1st April assumed responsibility for personnel and administration. It has been agreed in principle that a substantial number of posts in the Information Sections of our Missions abroad shall be filled from Branches A and B of the Foreign Service, .about a hundred candidates formerly employed abroad by the Ministry of Information as temporaries have been interviewed by selection boards with a view to establishment in one or other branch of the Foregn Service. Home Service Allowances. 5* This matter, which was described last summer as the greatest financial problem affecting members of the Foreign Service, has been settled on terms satisfactory to the Foreign Office, the allowances are being paid, and we are now at last able to post men to the Foreign Office v/ithout having to ask ourselves whether the individuals in qusstion can afford to live in London. New salary scales for the Foreign Service and regrading of Senior posts. 6. On January 1st a new scale of salaries came into force for the Home Civil Service. This scale was applied to the Foreign Service and we now have 8 posts carrying a basic salary of £ 3 , 500 , 11 at £ 2 , 500 , 12 at £2,200 and 30 at £2,000. Before that date there was no post in the Foreign Service, with the exception of that of the Permanent Under-Secretary (£3,000), carrying a salary of more than £ 2,500 - and only 8 of them. Promotion progpects . 7. General promotion prospects in the Foreign Service have been greatly improved in the course of last year by the re-opening and up-grading of a large number of posts especially on the Consular side. Complements/ms\- * o ConpiGiaonts r.nd gradings of the various hranch e s of the Foreig n Service* 8. The long-tern permanent complements for the various branches of the re-organised Foreign Service have been worked out and are now under discussion with the Treasury* Among other aspects^ these proposals provide for the transfer from Branch A (the highest branch) of some 120 posts to Branch B (the equivalent of the executive and clerical grades)* This will give very much better prospects to members of the executive and clerical grades, and these prospects vail be further improved by the accepted policy of promotion from Branch B to Branch .. of individuals v/ho display suitable qualities 0 Estrbli shn nt of _unqs tab li shed staff at posts abroad. 9* One of the black spots in Foreign Office staff administration in the past has been the existence of a large number of staff at Consular posts abroad who have been employed on an unestablished basis v/ithout any hope of pension-, Discussions with the Treasury with a view to remedying this have been in progress, and agreement has now been reached on proposals which will enable the Foreign Office to confer establishment (and pensionability) on a large proportion of existing temporary employees. This agreed scheme will grant establishment on a much more favourable scale than that laid down for temporary employees of the Home Civil Service in the White Paper on Reconstruction Recruitment. It will apply to staff at missions and commercial diplomatic posts as well as at consular posts* For eign _Sery.ice_ Regu lations 10. The amalgamation of the three former Services&gt; whose terms of service differed in many respects, made it necessary to draw up consolidated regulations regarding things like foreign allowances, outfit grants, travel payments and leave, which would apply to all members of the Foreign Service* It was also desirable to draw up a complete code which would tell all members of the Service what their duties and rights are. The preparation of these new regulations, which in general are more favourable than the existing regulations and take account of modern conditions, has now been practically completed in consultation with the Treasury in so far as the senior Branch of the Service is concerned. We are now discussing with the Treasury the regulations for the other Branches. Rllowances wlii1e_ on duty or le ave in this c_ountry i2 _ 11. This exceedingly complicated question is allied to that of the Foreign Service Regulations. Previous arrangements were not satisfactory but agreement ha.s now been reached with the Treasury on a new scheme v/hich tidies up the situation and covers certain types of cases where at present some hardship is experienceda Foreign/cconnodation in London Foreign Office accoi^.iodation in London 12, Ls regards the long-tern problen v/e are proceeding on the assumption that a decision has been taken in favour of locating the new Foreign Office on the Carlton House Terrace site c The Ministry of Works have told us that a really efficient, up-to-date office building can be constructed on the site and have selected an Architect to plan its development and have asked us to state our requirements as fully and precisely as possible. '.7o are setting up a working party, consisting of a cross-section of Foreign Office opinion, with experts from the Ministry of Works and the Treasury Organisation and Methods Division, to make recommendations as to the best lay-out of departments and the organisation of the administrative machine to secure maximum efficiency* This project will not, of course, mature for some years* (The whole of the present buildings., excluding the Hash frontage of the Mall, will have to be demolished and rebuilt on modern lines)&gt; In the meantime the Secretary of State has written to the Prime Minister suggesting that the Foreign Office should temporarily take over the India Office and the Colonial Office in the Downing Street block. This proposal is understood to be with the Prime Minister but no decision has boon comuonicated. Pending the out-come of this, v/e are still short of elbow room in Downing Street. /-r&gt; Meanwhile a number of existing houses on the Carlton House Terrace site are being put into order so that we may transfer there the Overseas Information Department taken over from the Ministry of Information® They are now in buildings near Baker Street and their move to Carlton House Terrace, which will take place gradually ever the next three months, will represent an important stop towards their closer integration with the Foreign Office Political Departments. Reorganisation of Administrative Departments. 13* When the former Orernnn Embassy was put in order for us, it was possible to effect the ro-organisation of the former Chief Clerk’s Department, Personnel Department, and Establishment Section of Consular Department, and locate them all together in this building® There are now three Departments, viz® Personnel Department, Establishment and Organisation Department and Finance Department. The duties and responsibilities of each have been more closely defined and additional staff obtained. This has resulted in an improvement in the handling of administrative matters. Absorption cf Overseas Information Department from the_ Ministry of „Ipf ormatt.on® 14* These departments have been successfully taken over and integrated into the Foreign Office organisation, so far as accommodation difficulties permit (see para©11 above), .arrangements for establishment and financial control are working satisfactorily.

Both had held the rank of Ambassador* More extensive use of the powers given us by the Foreign Service i;ct to retire men on pension before 60 will undoubtedly be ma.de when we are not so short of trained staff. Relations with the Treasury* 18. I concluded my Memorandum of last august with a tribute to the helpful attitude displayed by the Establishment Branch of the Treasury. I am glad to say that our relations with that Branch continue to be very satisfactory, and our manifold requests are being met in a generous and co-operative spirit. (Signed) DAVID SCOT? July 1st* 19h6.s CIRCULAR No. 45 — Refresher Courses, 1947 Foreign Office, May, 1947. Two more week-end courses will be organised the Foreign Office at Oxford during the coming summer. Dates are not yet definite, but one course will take place about mid-July and the second about mid-September. Both courses will have as their general topic the economic state of the country, in both its internal and external aspects. Any member of the Service who is likely to be in this country at either time, or who qualifies for a refresher tour (the normal qualification is two years’ absence from United Kingdom), and who would like to be included in one of the Oxford courses, should let Personnel Department know.

It should be emphasised that the effective date of 1st January, 1947, means the date of incurring liability and not the date of payment of bills. It follows that expenditure covering a period beginning in 1946 and ending in 1947 will need to be divided up, part being paid for entirely by the officer under the old system and part being chargeable to public funds as to 2/3rds. Any post receiving a claim for payment in such a case should report it to this Department for assessment together with relevant details and recommendations before any payment is made. 3.

Failure to comply with this stipulation will mean that it will be assumed that private arrangements must have been made for an “ set-up,” and an application for demobilisation coupons will not be apparently not understood that actual coupons are not issued to an applicant or to relations in the United Kingdom on behalf of the applicant. The principle is that a credit, to the value of the agreed coupon allowance, is held by the Department keeping the proxy records (in the case of all Foreign Service, Information and Commercial Diplomatic personnel, the “proxy” is Miss B. Coxon of the Establishment and Organisation Department). The applicant is then authorised to order clothing to be exported direct to the overseas address by a retailer in the United Kingdom, up to the total credit allowed, without surrendering actual coupons. The retailer obtains his coupon replacement direct from the “ proxy,” the applicant himself not being concerned in the transaction. Amount of credit to be allowed (i) Male Officers (non-Regulars) and male other ranks—90 + half emigration rate laid down for the country proposed for residence. (ii) Female officers and other ranks—90 + half emigration rate + 56. (iii) Regular officers—90 + half emigration rate + 63 where Admiralty, War Office or Air Ministry Certificate of Entitlement is forwarded with application. Procedure for applications Applicants should give the information contained in the attached pro forma, and send Certificate from last Commanding Officer confirming release overseas with effective dates of the beginning and end of release or retirement leave, together with a certificate from the Head of the Section by whom the applicant is employed. If it is desired that a relative or friend iiCthe United Kingdom select the goods, the name and address should be included in the original applica tion, bearing in mind that coupons will not be sent to the relative, and that therefore he/she should not use his/her personal coupons as no refund can be guaranteed. On receipt of the required information the “ proxy ” will send authority for export (stating the total credit allowed) to the applicant, who will forward his order to the retailer in the United Kingdom and advise the “ proxy ” H.M.

In the case of a relative being nominated to select the goods, the letter of authority will be sent direct to the relative with informa tion as to the available coupon credit, the applicant being informed that this has been done- The retailer or the nominated relative will inform the proxy of the total coupon value of the order, the coupons then being despatched direct to the retail shop, the retailer, in turn, exporting the goods direct to the overseas address In view of the fact that cases continue to occur where personnel released overseas return to the United Kingdom, the following arrangements will be made by the Board of Trade : — (1) Return within a period of six months from the commencement of release leave:— (a) If return only on leave, the above export arrangements must continue, although clothing may be selected for export whilst the officer is in the United Kingdom. (b) If returning to the United Kingdom for residence within six months, a flat rate of 90 coupons will be issued, or 90 plus 56, where appropriate, in the case of women, or 90 plus 63 in the case of a Regular officer on presentation of Certificate. It should be noted that there will be no other entitlement to any additional demobilisation coupons at a future date. (2) If return is made between six months and one year, an issue will only be made on a “ needs test ” up to a maximum of 90 coupons (for a man) or 146 (for a woman) where allowance at United Kingdom rate has been issued, it being borne in mind that the applicant must have made arrangements to obtain civilian clothing in the overseas country for a period of more than six months. (3) If return is made after one year from commencement of release or retire ment leave, the applicant must enter the United Kingdom as a “ civilian immigrant ” and will be dealt with under the normal civilian rules, with no belated entitlements to “ Release coupon allowance ” having been overseas, as a civilian, for a full year or more. N.B.—Applications in any of these circumstances should be made in the first instance to Board of Trade (Section 2a), 91, Victoria Street, London, S.W. 1. and not to the “proxy.” Applications made for proxy after six months Normally, these will be refused on the grounds that there was evidently no immediate need for a “ set-up ” of civilian clothing, but applicants (if holding a British passport) will be informed that exports, to a maximum value of (at present) 50 coupons, can be arranged after they have been overseas as civilians, for one year from the commencement of release leave without return to the United Kingdom. It must be clearly understood that the Board of Trade and the “ proxy ” will in no case take responsibility for the financial transaction between the purchaser and the retailer. None of these arrangements cover personnel released or retired, in Germany, for whom special arrangements have been made for the issue of coupons through the Board of Trade.

N.B.—Applications in any of these circumstances should be made in the first instance to Board of Trade (Section 2a), 91, Victoria Street, London, S.W. 1. and not to the “proxy.” Applications made for proxy after six months Normally, these will be refused on the grounds that there was evidently no immediate need for a “ set-up ” of civilian clothing, but applicants (if holding a British passport) will be informed that exports, to a maximum value of (at present) 50 coupons, can be arranged after they have been overseas as civilians, for one year from the commencement of release leave without return to the United Kingdom. It must be clearly understood that the Board of Trade and the “ proxy ” will in no case take responsibility for the financial transaction between the purchaser and the retailer. None of these arrangements cover personnel released or retired in Germany, for whom special arrangements have been made for the issue of coupons through the Board of Trade.

Xpo 4 ^ &gt; 'on M t, Foreign Office, March, 1947 Payment in the United Kingdom of Monthly Allotments in respect of Established Staff at Posts Abroad Sir, . . , During the war it was found necessary in certain cases when established staff proceeded to posts abroad to institute the system whereby monthly allotments were paid in this country to the dependents of such staff or to their banking accounts. 2. It is considered that the time has now come to revert to the normal method of payment of the emoluments of established staff, namely to pay only at the end of each quarter on receipt from the staff of quarterly life certificates. 3. It is, of course, recognized that the necessity for monthly payments may still exist in cases where married officers have to provide for the maintenance of their families in the United Kingdom and it is not proposed to disturb the existing arrangements in such cases. 4. With effect from 1st April, 1947, however, the payment of monthly allotments in respect of single established officers will cease, the last monthly payment to be made in the United Kingdom being that due on 31st March, 1947. 5. Thereafter it will be necessary for any such officers who may wish to continue to make monthly payments to effect arrange ments for this through their banks or agents in this country. 6. Where such an arrangement cannot be made, and officers, cannot avoid making monthly allotments, payment may be made at the post by Bills of Exchange drawn in favour of the nominee. 7. Until further notice, the above arrangement will not apply to Information staff. . 8. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty s Representatives (as No. 051).

I enclose, for information and guidance, a notice circulated in the Foreign Office and request that every effort be made to observe, as far as possible, the directions outlined therein. 3. As requested in Foreign Office circular of 19th June, 1925 [K 8128/8128/250], care should be given to the storage of supplies in order that they may not deteriorate. 4. Copies of this circular are enclosed for transmission to the consular posts under your superintendence. 5. A circular in similar terms is being addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. 068). ERNEST BEYIN. His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers. 13988—1 33405—22aEconomy in the Use of Stationery For some time, after the acute difficulties of the fuel crisis have been /\ overcome, there will be shortages of fuel, power and raw materials which will make it impossible for Stationery Office services to be restored to levels which as late as the autumn of 1946 would have seemed normal. The supply of paper is a striking example. The estimate of paper to be made for official purposes during the period from Mardh to June this year had to be scaled down substantially because the raw material was not available, and before the immediate fuel crisis the allocation of coal to paper mills had been cut by 50 per cent. : a ton of paper needs from 2^ to 5 tons of coal to make it. Paper will probably be the most acute of the Stationery Office’s supply problems but there- is hardly an industry from which they draw supplies where production is not lagging behind what was formerly desired. It is not practicable to set up official machinery to bring the demands of departments within the limits of a pre-determined ration of paper, printing, &amp;c. In order, therefore, to ensure that there is no serious hampering of vital public business by delay in meeting demands, departments must ease the total pressure by exercising exceptional restraint in their demands. Such war-time restrictions as have been relaxed must be reimposed. In addition to the general objective of seeing that demands are put forward only for essential purposes the following special points should be borne in mind (1) Very special efforts are needed to bring the demand for new envelopes within the manufacturing capacity available. An old envelope and an economy label must always be used for non- confident ial purposes—care being taken to see that any old address is obliterated—and pouches and boxes should be employed as often as possible for the movement of secret material. 18088 [33405—21](2) Surplus quantities of envelopes (and other stationery) should he returned to Supplies Department for reissue where required. Care in opening will add considerably to the life of an envelope. (3) Office rules regarding brevity in minute writing should be scrupu lously observed. Efforts should also be made to place all minutes on the jacket and the spacing of minutes should be reduced to the minimum compatible with legibility. (4) All typing must be in single spacing and both sides of the paper used—except for communications to Foreign Representatives in London. Octavo paper should be used as far as possible and a more frequent use made of quarto instead of foolscap. (5) Waste paper is still urgently needed and any useless documents should be put out for salvage. There are numerous other ways of effecting economies which will occur to all, if the need for doing so is constantly borne in mind, and I rely upon every member of the staff to play his part in helping to solve this present problem. 0. G. SARGENT.MTiU X [ XA 033/1/47 ] CIRCULAR No. 76 Foreign Office, 12th September, 1947. Sir \ Census of Office Machinery. I have to refer to Foreign Office circular despatch No. K 668/668/250 of 29th May, 1939, and to Foreign Office circular despatch No. K 10242/5852/250 of 27th September, 1933, referred to therein, copies of which are enclosed, requesting a triennial return of all office machinery, i.e., typewriters, duplicators, calcu lating machines, &amp;c., held on charge at your post. 2. During the war years the submission of this return, in some instances, unavoidably fell into abeyance, with the result that the records of H.M.S.O. are no longer complete. 3. In view of the general shortage of supplies of office machinery it has become necessary to exercise more stringent control over the supply and disposal of such equipment, and up-to-date records are essential. 4. I have therefore to request that the submission of this tri ennial return may be resumed with effect 1st January, 1948. 5. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. 0161). I am directed by Viscount Halifax to remind you of Foreign Office circular despatch K 10242/5852/250 of the 27th September, 1933, asking for triennial returns of all office machinery such as typewriters, duplicators, calculating machines, &amp;c., at consular posts. No separate return of such machinery has been received from your post this year, and the information required has to some extent been obtained from the annual return of Government property at your post. It is more convenient and more satisfactory, however, to have a separate return containing the information asked for in the circular despatch mentioned above, even although this may involve duplication.

Sir, 14287—1 34142—2It is also desirable that the serial number of each machine mentioned in the return should not, as is sometimes done, be copied from a previous return, but should be verified by inspection of the machine itself. I am therefore to request that note may be taken of these requirements and that action may be taken accordingly in 1942 and every third year thereafter.

The make, size and serial number of all machines should be carefully recorded on the return and a note made against any machine which is no longer in use or has been otherwise disposed of. 2. The return should be furnished in triplicate and the first should be forwarded immediately. The next return thereafter should be rendered on the 1st January, 1936, and should carefully record any change since the date of the previous return.

Scott. Mr. G. A. Carey Foster has been appointed head of this Department and will also be the Foreign Office representative on the Cabinet Security Panel. 2. The Security Department will act as a co-ordinating centre /'' N for collating information and for the provision of directives and expert advice on all security matters which concern the Foreign Service. It will also be responsible for superintending the execution of those measures which may be required to ensure the safety of ^ P rem ^ ses use d by the Foreign Office and posts abroad and for the security of official papers, print and cyphers kept therein or in ! transit. Its functions are primarily advisory rather than executive. »v/ 3. The Department is also the channel through which negotia tions with other Departments and Ministries in regard to security matters are conducted, i.e., Scotland Yard, Service Departments, &amp;c. 4. Within this broad outline the Security Department will be responsible (a) for initiating such action as may be necessary to ensure that proper and adequate arrangements are made by the authorities concerned for the personal safety of the Secretary of State when he visits foreign countries; (/;) for administering and supervising the internal security arrangements of the Foreign Office building proper and of other buildings which are occupied by the Foreign Office, and of the out-housed departments of the Foreign Office; (c) for exercising general supervision, in concert with the individual administrative officers concerned, over the physical security of the ancillary communications estab lishments of the Foreign Office and the recruitment of guards for those establishments; {d) for ensuring that a correct standard of security discipline is maintained both as regards the safe-keeping of docu ments and the control of persons entering the various Foreign Office offices; (e) for advising officers in charge of Foreign Service posts abroad in regard to security matters;I have to inform you that under new regulations British t postage stamps, being of philatelic interest, are subject to licence if exported outside the sterling area. The export of British postage stamps in letters sent through the Foreign Office bag by friends and relatives in this country of staff abroad, therefore, can no longer be permitted. 2. To obviate difficulties thus caused, Heads of Missions may order postage stamps through the Foreign Office, against prior repayment by means of cheques drawn in favour of the Finance Officer, Foreign Office. Arrangements should be made for their distribution only to persons entitled to bag facilities (including personnel of Information and other sections of your staff), on whom it should be impressed that friends and relatives must not be asked to send additional supplies to them direct. 3.

Independently of this authority, facilities are now available for the establishment of typists and shorthand- typists employed at His Majesty’s Consular posts on a temporary basis. For this purpose they will fall into two age categories: (1) those born on or after 2nd August, 1915; and (2) those born before that date. 3. Those in category (1) who wish to become established will have to qualify by examination and should make application direct to Uie Secretary of the Civil Service Commission, 6, Burlington Gardens, London, W. 1, on the appropriate form of which a copy is enclosed in this circular together with an explanatory leaflet. The closing date for applications is the 1st June, 1946, and you should telegraph the number of application forms which will be required at your post. 4. Candidates in category (2) will be considered on an individual basis. The qualifying period of service will be at least six months before the end of October, 1945. The consolidated rates of pay, excluding local allowance, will be 96/- a week for shorthand-typists and 84/- a week for typists, with annual increments for length of service up to a maximum of 108/- and 99/-. Possession of a Royal Society of Arts certificate indicating that a candidate has reached the standard of 50 words per minute in typing or 120 words per minute in shorthand will be accepted asproof of necessary technical qualification. Failing that, candidates will be required to demonstrate ability to reach a standard of 40 words per minute with not more than 2 per cent, of errors in typing, 100 words per minute with not more than 2 per cent, of errors in shorthand. Excep tionally recommended candidates who can attain these speeds with more than 2 per cent, but not more than 6 per cent, of errors may be accepted as trainees involving reduced pay until full standard of efficiency is reached. The qualifications of recommended candidates should be stated. Suitable condidates for whom there are no estab lished vacancies abroad will be considered for posts at home. In making your recommendations, therefore, you should indicate whether any of the candidates would' be willing to serve at home if no established posts abroad could be found for them. If employed outside London the basic salaries would be slightly less than those in dicated above. 5. Full particulars of candidates in category (2) should be forwarded as soon as possible in triplicate with your own comments and recommendation (where appropriate). Each application should be made on a separate sheet. 6. Answers to this circular should be kept separate from answers to the' telegram referred to above and applications and recommendations arising from the latter need not preclude application unde** the present circular. 7. If there is no candidate at your post you should report the fact. 8. All candidates must be of British nationality. Married women whose marriages are still subsisting will not be eligible.

It is expected that these examinations will continue to be held at intervals for at least three years, but the exact period will depend on the subsequent course of the war and on the rate at which release from the Forces proceeds. (ii) The number of vacancies to be filled from these examinations will certainly be very large. It is not yet possible to say exactly how many there will be, but the figure of 20,000 - 25,000 may be given as a provisional estimate. (iii) Candidates must fill in the appropriate Application Form. Civilian candidates can obtain the forms from the Secretary, Civil Service Commission, Burlington Gardens, London, W.l, and should send the completed form to the same address. Candidates serving in the Women’s Services* must obtain Application Forms in accordance with directions given in Service Orders, which will also state the address to which the forms should be sent when completed. (iv) Candidates now serving in the Women’s Services must send in their Application Forms in time to reach the Commissioners not later than six months after the completion of their service. All other candidates must send them in by December ist, 1945 ; but the Commissioners may at their discretion accept an application at a later date if they are satisfied that the delay was due to circumstances outside the candidate's control. A further announcement will be made if the final date should be extended for particular classes of candidates. All candidates are, however, particularly asked to send in their applications as soon as possible, even if, owing to Service exigencies, they see no prospect of being able to compete until after their release from the Forces. This will assist the Commissioners in their task of spreading the vacancies over the whole series of examinations in such a way as to give a fair chance to all candidates, wherever and under whatever conditions they may be serving ; if candidates delay sending in their Application Forms they may find that the Commissioners, through ignorance of the facts, have reserved less than the due proportion of vacancies for late-comers. (v) The receipt of each Application Form will be acknowledged, and any candidate who has filled up and returned the form but has not received an acknowledgment within a reasonable time should write to the Secretaiy, Civil Service Commission, Burlington Gardens, London, W.l. (vi) Candidates will be summoned for examination at the discretion of the Commissioners. The whole series of examinations will be treated as a single competition, an appropriate number of vacancies being reserved for competitors in the later examinations. The intention is that no candidate shall be handicapped if, owing to Service requirements or other reasons, she competes in one of the later examinations. (vii) Many of the vacancies will be in provincial towns. Successful candidates will be asked where they wish to serve. The Commissioners will allocate them to the towns they select in so far as vacancies are available. If this is not possible they will be given an opportunity of appointment elsewhere. No guarantee can be given that a vacancy in a provincial town will be available for any particular candidate. Civil Service Commission, June 1945.

Transfers are more likely to occur in Departments having a arge provincial organization, such as the Assistance Board, Customs and Excise Department, Inland Revenue Department, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of National Insurance, Post Office. Starting Pay 13. I ersons appointed under these Regulations will enter the scale of the Class to which they may be assigned at a salary determined by their age. If a candidate's age on entry is 20 or less, she will enter at the salary for her age indicated in the above scales. If her age on entry is over 20, she will receive one increment for each completed year of age above 20 and a further increment on her next succeeding birthday, which will then become her incremental date. 14. Persons already holding situations in the Civil Service, if successful in obtaining appointment under these Regulations, will also enter at a salary appropriate to their age in accordance with the above rule ; they will not be allowed to carry with them the salary drawn by them in their previous situations, if this would be more favourable. Probation 15. Officers appointed to any of these classes will be regarded as being on probation for at least one year after entry during which they will be required to satisfy the Head of their Department that they are in every \tfay suitable for permanent employment in the Service. An officer whose probationary service is not regarded as satisfactory will not be retained in the public service. Seniority ^ ^i 6 Wh ° le s ^ es exan }inations for the Shorthand Typist, Typist ancbClerical Assistant Classes held under these Regulations will be treated as one competition, and successful candidates will be graded for seniority in the respective Classes according to age, except that, among candidates who are born in the same year, reckoned as any period of twelve months beginning with the 2nd August, seniority will be determined by the candidates’ total marks in the competition. Promotion 17. Shorthand Typists, Typists and Clerical Assistants have opportunities of promotion to the Clerical Class a ter se me years service, if found suitable. Shorthand Typists who prefer to specialize will have chances of promotion to a secretarial grade with pay on the Woman Clerical Officer’s scale. Superannuation /^ &gt;eisons appointed to situations under these Regulations with a certificate of the Commissioners will be eligible for pension and other benefits in accordance with the Superannuation Acts. Women who retire on marriage alter not less than six years’ qualifying service will be eligible for a marriage gratuity. ^. w (31-11/1004) Wt. 33755/116 (20m.) 10/45 T. &amp; B. Op. 468. r* 1/0 .

Sir, I have to inform you that revised rates of pay for established and temporary shorthand-typists and typists have been promulgated with effect from the 1st January, ~ 1946. 2. In the case of temporary staff serving overseas the new scales are applicable only to United Kingdom based staff on identifiable United Kingdom scale of pay, and not to staff in receipt of inclusive salaries. 3. Members of and new entrants to the temporary typing grades will enter the new scales at the rate of pay appropriate to their age, or if over 25 years of age, at the rate of pay for age 25. Temporary officers in these grades who have served for one year or more on the maximum of the old scale will receive an immediate increase of one increment on the new scale with effect from the 1st January, 1946, which will then become the incremental date. 4. Existing members of the established typing grades will be assimilated to the point in the new' scales which they would have reached on the 1st January, 1946, had they been paid on the new scales from the date of their first appointment in the grade. 5. Temporary (United Kingdom graded) shorthand- typists and typists at Consular posts who may hitherto ^ have been assigned an annual rate of pay will, in future, be paid at the revised weekly rates, and this will apply also to the cases of temporary clerks as and when they reach the new maximum of the salary scales (see paragraphs 8 and 9 below). 6 .

To facilitate adjustments of salary in the cases of officers whose emoluments are paid in full locally I enclose copies of a memoradum showing the revised weekly rates of pay. 8 . Following the revision of the salary scales of the typing grades an improvement has also been effected in the pay of temporary clerks on United Kingdom scales of pay. For these grades an addition has been made to the scales of one increment with effect from the 1st January, 1946, the revised maxima (exclusive of consolidated addition), now being: — 9. Temporary clerks who, on the 1st January, 1946, had reached their former maximum may therefore receive a further increment on their normal incremental date or on the 1st January, 1946, if on the latter date they have been on the maximum for one year or more.

Promotion of Foreign Service Officers from Grade YII to Grade YI. Sir, The amalgamation of the former Diplomatic, Commer cial Diplomatic and Consular services has made necessary certain changes in the procedure for promoting Foreign Service Officers from Grade VII to Grade VI. 2. In the past, when a first Secretary in the Diplomatic service was first appointed to a Counsellor’s post, he normally held acting rank for a period of two years. If he had during this period shown that he was capable of filling the higher post, his promotion was then confirmed and he became a full Counsellor. There was, however, no similar probationary period for the Consular and Commercial Diplomatic services. • 8 . It has now been decided that with effect from the date of this circular all Foreign Service Officers of Grade VII provisionally selected for promotion shall hold acting rank for a probationary period of two years, when the confirmation of their promotion will be considered. 4. A Letter of Appointment to their new acting rank will be issued to officers on first appointment to a Grade VI post. During the probationary period officers will hold the local rank of the posts they actually fill, and draw salary and allowances appropriate to Grade VI. 5. A Consular Commission for the purpose of obtaining an Exequatur will be issued to an officer on first appoint ment to a Grade VI Consular post, but no Foreign Service Grade Commission will be issued to an officer promoted from Grade VII until his substantive promotion to Grade VI has been confirmed.

Locally recruited are not eligible. The dividing line between the three age groups should be fixed at 1st January, 1948, as follows. Candidates born on and after 1 st January, 1918, should be included in the 17-30 group, candidates born on or after 1st January, 1908 (but before 1st January, 1918) in the 30-40 group, and candidates bom on or after 1st January, 1888 (but before 1st January, 1908) in the 40-60 group. When the Foreign Office quota for establishment under this scheme has been fixed we shall select suitable officers from among those who wish to be considered for establishment. Will you therefore at the same time please let us have the full names, place and date of birth, grade, parentage, languages (and special qualifica tions), details of Government service (including that in the armed forces, the corresponding women’s services, the Merchant Navy or Mercantile Marine) and the type of work on which employed, of all staff eligible under the agreement who are employed in the (1) Consulate-General; (2) Consulate. '•v These particulars are required only in respect of those officers who can be recommended for establishment. Officers selected will be established in the Home Civil Service. Consideration will be given to the question of their inclusion in Branch B of the Foreign Service when more information is available regarding the grades in which they are to be established. We shall be glad if you will let us have the numbers of eligible staff (divided in the various age groups) and your recommendations with the necessary details (by air) as soon as possible and in any case not later than 15th October, 1947. Nil returns should be sent where appropriate. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty’s Repre sentatives (as No. 0164). Yours ever, Personnel Department. His Majesty’s Consulate-General/Consulate. 14297—1 34142—7aAgreement between the Treasury, the Civil Service Alliance and the Association of Ex-Service Civil Servants, REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TEMPORARY CLERKS 1. It is agreed that 10,000 temporary clerks shall be established in the Treasury Clerical Officer (or analogous clerical grades in departmental class organisations) with effect from 1st January, 1948. 2 . Those eligible for establishment under this Agreement shall be temporary clerks of all grades (and members of such temporary departmental grades as may be agreed departmentally between official and staff sides to be analogous with temporary clerks) who have had five years’ or more continuous service by the 1st January, 1948. The continuity rules which operate in regard to pay, &amp;c., will apply, except that all service in the Armed Forces, the corresponding Women’s Services, the Merchant Navy or the Mercantile Marine (for the purpose of this Agreement all such service shall be reckoned whether or not it took place during the war of 1939-45) shall reckon as if it had been temporary Govern ment service, but a minimum of six months’ actual temporary Government service shall be required in all cases. Officers who, if they continued to serve until 1st January, 1948, would have the necessary qualifying service and are otherwise eligible, but ^ who are discharged on account of redundancy on and after 1st May, 1947, will not thereby be rendered ineligible unless their selection for discharge arises from their having been found unable to carry out the duties of their grade with due efficiency. Married temporary women clerks including former women Clerical Officers and Clerical Assistants and married women officers in analogous clerical grades in departmental class organisations wjjio had resigned established appointments on marriage but had continued to serve in an unestab lished capacity, shall be eligible. As regards the latter, previous established service shall be reckoned towards the qualifying period provided the officer gives an undertaking to refund her marriage gratuity (if any) in the event of being re-established. ■ 3. Temporary Assistants shall not be eligible for establishment under this Agreement except for temporary clerks who have been upgraded to Temporary Assistant on a purely temporary basis after 1st January, 1947, and who are likely to revert within a short period. Subject to agreement on the Departmental Whitley Council such officers shall be given the option of reverting to tem porary clerk before the 1st October, 1947, and thus becoming eligible for establishment under this Agreement. 4. The minimum age limit shall be 17 and the maximum age limit 60, both reckoned as at the 1st January, 1948; and the 10,000 established posts shall be allocated between the three age groups 17-30, 30-40 and 40-60 in proportion to the field of eligible staff in each age group.3 5. The selection of candidates for establishment shall be made by employing Departments, and for this purpose the 10,000 established posts shall be allocated between Departments in proportion to their numbers of eligible temporary clerks. The method of selection should be agreed with the staff representatives in each Department, and Departments should themselves be responsible for carrying out the agreed arrangements. In the case of Departments whose numbers of eligible staff are not large enough to justify the allocation of even one established post, however, candidates should be pooled and the selection carried out by the Civil Service Commission. In all cases the selection should be based on merit, but we would suggest that selecting Departments should take care to ensure that those temporary clerks who have taken up duty relatively recently, after war service, and may not yet have had the fullest opportunity to display their merits, should nevertheless be given full consideration. 6 . It is agreed that the situation with regard to the establish ment of temporary clerks should be examined afresh in the course of 1948. The arrangements which will then be appropriate will depend upon developments, in the meantime, in the total size of the Civil Service and in the size of its established and temporary clerical staffs respectively, and upon further such developments in so far as they can then be foreseen. The Treasury wish to place it on record, however, that at the desire of the staff associations they have brought forward to the 1st January, 1948, the whole of an establishment operation which they had previously proposed to cover the period 1948-50 and that they are in no way committed to any expectation that further operations of this • magnitude will prove possible after 1948. Signed on behalf of the Treasury, (Sgd.) A. J. D. WINNIFRITH. Signed on behalf of the Civil Service Alliance, (Sgd.) L. C. WHITE. Signed on behalf of the Association of Ex-Service Civil Servants, (Sgd.) H. W. FENN. 1th June, 1947. Addendum 1. Paragraph 2 of the Agreement does not mean that Forces service is to reckon regardless of the gap between it and entry into temporary Government service. A gap of more than three months breaks continuity in the same way as between two periods of temporary Government service. For example, a man who has served as a Temporary Clerk for six months only in the course of 1947, having had four and a half years’ Forces service in 1914-18 is not eligible.2. As regards the application of the continuity rules to previous Government service, no officer should be considered ineligible solely by reason of the fact that his previous Government service was in an inferior grade or on a different {e.g., industrial) class of work. 3. Former Temporary Clerks regraded as Temporary Superin tendents of Typists, as Temporary Shorthand Typists or as Tem porary Typists, if qualified on the score of length of service, are eligible for establishment. Personal Assistants are not eligible. Officers eligible under this paragraph should not, however, be included in the numbers to be returned.[ XS 0139(3/47) ] CIRCULAR No. 91. un t&gt; * Foreign Office, 6 /A October, 1947. Consolidation of Salary Scales Sir, I have to inform you that consolidated salary scales as shown in the enclosure have been agreed by the Treasury for the Foreign Service and certain general classes of the Home Civil Service, as from 1st January, 1947, for all grades except the Clerical grade, for which the effective date is 1st July, 1947. In the cases of members of the Foreign Service serving abroad it has, however, been decided that unless the officer is already receiving consolidation addition to his basic salary 7 , these scales will not be payable until the officer commences to receive the new standard foreign allowances. Subject to this provision, officers will, in general, with the exception of those in the Clerical grade, enter the new scales at their rates of salary as on 1st January, 1947, and keep their present incremental dates. But where the pay, including consolidation addition, is below the new minimum for the grade, the officer’s salary will be raised to the minimum or to such higher point as may result from the addition of that proportion of the annual increment which has accrued since the last incremental date. The 1st January will become the new incremental date in either case. In cases where the rate of an officer’s next increment is changed as a result of assimilation to the new scale, accrued increment will be given to 1st January, 1947, which will then be the new incremental date, but officers will retain on a personal basis, until His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers. x 4337—i 34286 —qa2 31st December, 1947, the actual rate of salary reached before 10th May, 1947, if this is more favourable. Clerical officers will, in general, be assimilated to the new scales at age pay, up to age 25 (the minimum being at age 16), with effect from 1st July, 1947, in which case their birthdays will be their future incremental dates. Officers aged 25 and over will receive the pay for officers aged 25 and take 1st July as their incremental date, or if it is to their advantage they will enter the new scales on 1st July, 1947, at their existing basic salary, plus:— {a) accrued increment (within the old maximum) on the old basic scale, (6) consolidation addition on the total so reached, and (c) special increases of £20 (men) and £15 (women). Clerical officers who on 1st July, 1947, with increment accrued at the normal rate and consolidation addition, had reached £428 (men) or £343 (women) will proceed at once to the new maxima. Any arrears due to officers are being included with payment of salary and allowances for the June or September quarters, 1947.

Foreign Office, 1th October, 1946. r Adverse Reports on Staff. On several occasions in recent months an adverse report has been submitted to the Foreign Office by the Head of a Post abroad about an officer who had already left for the United Kingdom on leave, the report being accompanied by a request that the officer should not be allowed to return to that post. It is difficult for Personnel Department to challenge an officer on the basis of second-hand information about his misdemeanours and it places the officer himself in a difficult position if, as is generally the case, he has commitments or has left property at the post to which he had every expectation of returning. If there is cause for complaint against any officer he should be told of it before any formal report is submitted so that he may have an opportunity either to mend his ways or to produce evidence in rebuttal of any charges made against him. In this connexion please see Foreign Office circulars of December 1943 and the 30th August, 1946 (No. 0115), regarding Personal Reports. If a report is submitted to the Foreign Office recom mending his transfer he should be told of it so that he may know what to expect and arrange his affairs accordingly. It is appreciated that there may occasionally be cases in which it is considered desirable to remove an officer without making a specific charge or even discussing the matter with him. In any such case the report should be timed so that the officer can be transferred direct from his post and be given the necessary opportunity to clear up his affairs before his departure. D. J. SCOTT. His Majesty’s Superintendinj Consular Officers. 13579 32321—45i XM9/0/46 | CIRCULAR No. 95 c, CONFIDENTIAL. Foreign Office, S.W. 1. 14^/i October, 1940. My dear Consul, IN hi-§ letter,of 28th of August, Sir David Scott circulated a Report showing what progress has been made in recruiting and re-establishing the Foreign Service. After Dunkirk it took us four years to reconstitute our fighting services to the necessary pitch to enable us to land in Western Europe and defeat the Germans. In much the same way it will inevitably take time for the Foreign Service to recover from the facts that there was no recruitment to the permanent Service during the war years, that many Missions abroad had to be totally withdrawn and started again from the beginning, that the amalgamation of the various branches of the Foreign Service was begun in 1943, and that we shall be faced as a country for some time with a national shortage of men and materials. But although it took the Fighting Services four years to build up sufficiently for a landing in Western Europe, that did not mean that ^ they did nothing during that time. In the same way the Secretary of State is determined that everything possible shall be done as soon as possible to constitute a modernised, efficient and contented Service. This, in fact, was the principal directive which he gave me on my appointment as Chief Clerk. In order to carry it out the Administrative Departments will continue to do everything they can within the limitations, which all will recognise, of shortage of means and trained meh. It is not only the Foreign Service, nor even only Whitehall, but the country as a whole that is faced with the task of pulling itself up by its boot straps and the contribution which all are making in the United Kingdom by austerity is a cardinal factor. 13559 [32411]2 The two first main objectives which the Secretary of State has in hand for the Foreign Service are these. At home more space. Abroad a firm basis for the calculation of allowances. The need for more space does not have to be laboured for any Foreign Service officer who has recently served at home. But for those who are abroad one or two illustrations may be of interest. The Treasury have agreed that the minimum typing staff necessary for the Communications Department to deal with incoming and outgoing telegram distribution is over 60. At present the actual number employed is under 40. Even if the remainder could be recruited, there is nowhere in the present Foreign Office building where they could be seated. This leads naturally to the general question of typing. In the Foreign Office typing for most departments is at present a week behind. It is little consolation to know that in some other Government depart ments it is a fortnight behind. The reason is partly an over-all shortage of typists, whether required by the Government departments or private enterprise. Although all members of the Service at home and abroad can help by avoiding the use of typists except when vital, only time can correct this defect completely. But space comes into this, too. The Secretary of State has taken up the question personally and in conse quence we have hopes of obtaining more space in the very near future. We are also laying - plans now to rebuild a new Foreign Office on a site in Carlton House Terrace. Such rebuilding must, of course, be a loner- term project and will in no way alleviate the present need for more space here and now. While these facts may be of some interest to the Foreign Service as a whole, those abroad will be more directly concerned^ with the question of allowances. The plain fact is that the old systems for the calculation of allowances have broken down, and that until we can reach agreement on a new and equitable basis and bring it into effect for every single post abioad, the situation will be unsatisfactory. As said the Secretary of State himself has put this as one of the two first targets for creating an efficient and contented service. But even with his sup port and backing, it will take time, since it is a most difficult task to construct a pay system which will work efficiently throughout the world in its present state of economic instability. Meanwhile, and again with the Secretary of State’s support we are trying to devise ways and means of clearing up the back log of out standing questions concerning allowances. Once more, for reasons principally of shortage of trained staff, we may not be able to do this'6 as quickly as we and the Foreign Service abroad would wish. But we are doing our best. As an earnest of this, we are bringing in a system of sending acknowledgments to all communications from members of the Service. An example of the form of acknowledgment is attached, and it is meant to help members of the Foreign Service to understand which branch of the administrative departments deals with different aspects. This will enable all members of the Service to know how the reorganisation of the Administrative departments is working in practice. I should add that the words that your letter or telegram and savingram is being dealt with in the first instance by such and such a section should not be taken to imply that, where appropriate, the letter will not be seen by all concerned and if necessary be submitted to the Secretary of State himself. It is meant to show where different questions are devilled, if not decided, and I enclose four tables of organisation showing the various functions of senior members of the Personnel, Establishment and Organisation, Finance, and Establishment and Finance (Information) Departments. It is of course our aim that the last-named should be absorbed by the other three as soon as possible, and you will see from the table of organisation of the Finance Department that this process has alreadv begun. May I end on a personal note asking for your indulgence and help. The Chief Clerk and the Administrative Departments are, we know, here to serve the Foreign Service, and not the other way round. If we sometimes seem slow and often not on your side, we trust that this will be appearance and not reality. So that we shall understand your difficulties and you ours, the Secretary of State is anxious that t, as Chief Clerk, and other senior members of the Administrative Depart ments should get about abroad as much as circumstances allow and without in any way trying to arrogate to ourselves the work of the Inspectors. (See Circular No. 93 of 12th October.) We do not, of course, intend that such visits should be disguised joy-rides and burdens to Missions, and they will indeed never be undertaken except to serve necessary purposes. Yours sincerely, HAROLD CACCIA, Assistant Under-Secretary of State — Establishment and Finance (Chief Clerk).SPECIMEN ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Foreign Office, nth October, 1946. Visits of Foreign Service Officers to United Kingdom. A number of cases have recently been brought to my notice, of Foreign Service officers returning to the United Kingdom at the request of other Government departments, without seeking permission from me sufficiently far in advance to enable full advantage to be taken of the visit. I shall be glad if you will impress upon all members of your staff that not only should the permission of this Department be obtained as far in advance as possible for all visits to this country whether on leave or duty; but also that it is incumbent upon them as a matter of duty to keep the Records Section of Personnel Department informed both of their projected movements and changes of address during their stay in the United Kingdom or elsewhere when absent from their posts. As you are aware, Foreign Service officers frequently return to the United Kingdom on refresher courses involving a period of duty and a period of leave. Since the end of the war the main object of these courses has been to instruct officers regarding the present position and future possibilities of our export trade and with this end in view the Department works in close touch with the Board of Trade in order to arrange the details in each individual case. 1 attach particular importance to this Sir, His Majesty’s Superintending Consular officers. 13607 32471—16*new development but it will be appreciated that, especially in these days of shortage of hotel accommodation, full advantage cannot be taken of these visits unless the Department is given notice well in advance both of the expected date of an ojiicer’s arrival here and of the industries or commercial concerns which it is im portant for him to study during his visit. All officers should report to Personnel Department, Foreign Office, personally as soon as they can on arrival in the United Kingdom, but in the event of their being unable to do this within 24 hours they should report their arrival and address by letter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN.« Report on Personal Aspects of Life at Foreign Service Posts Sir, My attention has been drawn to the fact that information available here about living conditions at Foreign Service posts abroad, of a type that would be useful to newly appointed officers, is seldom up to date. . I should be grateful, therefore, if you would be so good as to furnish a report, as soon as you conveniently can (and in any case before the end of the year), based on such points in the annexed list as apply to your post. It is not intended that these points should be dealt with at any great length, but it is desired that the reports should furnish an accurate account of conditions of life from the personal aspect. Detailed statis tical data should be avoided. Enclosure Suggested Points upon which Foreign Service Officers MAY BASE REPORTS ON THE “ PERSONAL ” ASPECT OF THEIR Respective Posts 1 .

If '-t [ XS 2/C/3 ] Foreign Office, 27^A November, 1946 Recruitment to Established Typing Grades I enclose herewith relevant extracts from Treasury Circular No. 27/46 of 9th October, regarding Special Measures for Recruitment to Established Typing Grades. Please have these brought to the attention of any members of your staff who may be concerned, including members of the Press Section. Research Assistants in the latter section, who have the requisite shorthand and typing qualifications, would be eligible for establishment as Shorthayid-Typists if they so wish. Copies of form A. (T.C.), P.D./ii, iii, and of the passages in Estacode referred to are also enclosed. I would draw your attention to the fact that these names should be with the Civil Service Commission by the 31st December. They should therefore reach the Foreign Office at the latest by 21st December. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN. His Majesty’s Consular Officer 13683—2 32621—26b' * EXTRACT FROM TREASURY CIRCULAR LETTER REGARDING SPECIAL MEASURES FOR RECRUITMENT TO ESTABLISHED TYPING GRADES . 1 . It has been decided that establishment in the appropriate typing grade may be offered on nomination of the Departments in which they are serving to all women in a temporary typing or clerical capacity who satisfy the following conditions, viz.:— (a) that they have prior to 1st October, 1946, given an aggregate of six months satisfactory service in a typing or clerical capacity (effective part-time service may be reckoned towards the qualifying period but it should be understood ^v that full-time service will be required upon establish ment); (See Note A below). (b) that they will on the above date have attained the age of 16 and noj: attained the age of 50*, and (c) that they are recommended by their Departments and certified by them as possessing technical proficiency according to the standards prescribed in extracts from Estacode attached. (See Note B below regarding Tele printer Operators.) 2. Candidates satisfying the above conditions will be offered appointment in the established grades of Shorthand-Typist, Trainee Shorthand-Typist, Typist or Trainee Typist as the case may be, according to their standard of technical proficiency, subject to their satisfying the Civil Service Commissioners as to health, character, &amp;c., and to the usual probationary period. Those who are found to be ineligible for establishment solely on medical grounds will be offered permanent unestablished appointments with the same conditions of service as their established colleagues except in the matter of sick pay and pension, and will be entitled to reconsideration in d\ie course. 3. Departments are asked to take immediate steps to bring the provisions of this Circular to the notice of all women eligible, and to arrange where necessary for the testing of the candidates’ qualifications. It will not be necessary to test candidates who hold a Royal Society of Arts certificate for 120 w.p.m. shorthand or 50 w.p.m. typing; nor those who have already been graded by test and have since given fully satisfactory service. Staff graded as Temporary Shorthand-Typists Grade I, Temporary Shorthand- Typists Grade II, Temporary Typists Grade I, and Temporary Typists Grade II, may, at the discretion of the Department, be nominated for establishment in the corresponding established Note A. — Qualifying Service. [As in E.O.C. 75/46 Para. 1.] Note B. — Teleprinter Operators. [As in E.O.C. 75/46 Para. 7.] * The extension of the upper age limit is under consideration. 13683—1 32691—26 agrades. Where tests are considered necessary the instructions for measurement of speed and errors for grading tests laid down in Estacode (B. i 56), attached, will apply. 4. Establishment under these arrangements will be with effect from a common date—viz. 1st January, 1947. Continuous whole time unestablished service immediately prior to estalishment will reckon as to one-half for superannuation purposes under Section 3 of the Superannuation Act, 1935. 5. Officers established under these arrangements should normally be given seniority below recruits from the Open Reconstruction Competition. Among themselves their seniority will be determined according to age. 6 . Officers established under these arrangements will be eligible for the leave allowance for established officers (Estacode E a 2), attached, but temporary service will not reckon towards the qualifying period'of 5 years service for the higher leave allowance. 7. Particulars of persons to be nominated for establishment have to be forwarded to the Civil Service Commission as soon as possible after the Departments have determined their technical proficiency and in any case not later than 3\st December, 1946. The particulars required are those prescribed in form A (T.C.). Those whom Departments propose to nominate may be so informed and told that they will be established with effect from 1st January, 1947, subject to the usual enquiries by the Civil Service Commis sioners. In general candidates will be assigned on establishment to the Departments in which they are serving but they will be liable to service elsewhere if required in accordance with the usual Service rules. 8 . In view of the above decision to permit establishment in the various typing grades on the basis of Departmental tests of technical proficiency, it has been decided that the following arrange ments shall apply in relation to temporary staff affected by this Circular who have entered for the Reconstruction Competition for appointments in the typing grades but have not yet taken the examination: (*) Temporary staff who are eligible to take the Reconstruction Competition and who still wish to do so in order to secure any more favourable benefits as regards seniority and starting pay which might thereby accrue, may still do so without prejudice to their being considered for establishment under the present arrangements. (ii) Candidates who have already entered for the Recon struction Competition may opt to withdraw their candi dature and rely on the opportunity for establishment conferred by this Circular, in which case any application fees which may have been paid by them will be refunded provided that they give notice accordingly to the CivilService Commission not later than 1st January, 1947. Those who wish to remain candidates for the Clerical Assistant grade in the event of failure to secure establish ment in a typing grade should still take the Reconstruction Competition. (in) Established members of the Clerical Assistant and Typing grades, who under normal arrangements are eligible for regrading within these grades on passing the appropriate shorthand or typing tests in the Open Competitions, will as from a current date and until further notice be eligible for such upgrading on Departmental nomina tion subject to the same Departmental certificates of technical proficiency as required under paragraph 1 (c) above. 9. Established typists who have already been promoted to acting Shorthand-Typists as a result of success in a shorthand proficiency examination may have their appointments confirmed on a substantive basis. EXTRACT FROM ESTACODE B i 56 Shorthand : 1. The writing in shorthand from dictation at 100 words a minute for three minutes of a passage from the extracts from speeches and articles, or the speed tests in the “ Shorthand Teachers’ Supplement ” (Pitman); and 2. The typing with suitable display of a transcript of the shorthand notes with not more than two errors which do not alter the sense of the passage or involve the violation of a fundamental shorthand principle, ‘for example, the word “ which ” substituted for the word italicised in the flowing sentence:— Its situation was wonderful, except for the fact, it must be stated, that it was miles from a town of any kind. The omission of a necessary punctuation mark or the insertion of an unnecessary one is counted as an error if it renders the passage ungrammatical or alters the sense. Time allowed for typed transcription: 25 minutes. Typewriting: The typing of a passage at not less than 40 w.p.m. for a period of 10 minutes. (An average word is reckoned as five letters.) Errors .—The maximum number of errors allowed is ten, but when it is necessary to test a candidate on a keyboard which is unfamiliar to her, errors obviously caused by unfamiliarity with the keyboard should be disregarded for the purpose of standard and assessment of speed.EXTRACT FROM ESTACODE E a 2 Leave Allowances Shorthand-Typists Clerk-Shorthand- Typists Typists Clerk-Typists 21 days rising to 24 days for those of 5 years or more established service in the grade. 18 days rising to 21 days for those of 5 years or more established service in the grade. H.M. Treasury E.O.C. 75/46 Ath November, 1946 ESTABLISHMENT OFFICERS CIRCULAR No. 75/46 Recruitment to Established Typing Grades Treasury File £.50145 The following notes supplement the provisions of T.C. No. 27/46:— 1. Qualifying Service. Service in the Forces may count towards the qualifying period of 6 months under paragraph 1 (a) of the Circular (but not for any other purpose), as also may serviqr m one of the so-called fringe Departments or quasi-Civil Service Departments. For the purposes of aggregating service it is proposed not to prescribe any hard and fast continuity rule, but subject to the requirement of 6 months reckonable service to allow Departments to exercise discretion ^ in the treatment of breaks in service, including cases where service is resumed after 1st October, 1946; provided that the Department feels it has had sufficient experience of the candidate s work and conduct by 31st December, 1946, to enable it to recommend her for establishment. 2. Teleprinter Operators (see also E.O.C. 52/46) To be established under this circular, teleprinter operators must pass at least the test for Trainee Typists. Departments should as far as possible grant operators the facilities necessary for working up their speed for this purpose; where ^present difficulties a short extension of the time limit for submitting nominations may be necessary.P.D. ii &amp; iii REPORT ON SERVICE S.242 Department .

[ XS 15H/0/1 ] Foreign Office 9th December, 1946 Sir, A Welfare Section has now been set up in the Foreign Office, to deal with and advise on questions which arise in connexion with the well-being of the staff of the Foreign Office and the Foreign Service both at home and abroad. Miss E. V. Thomas, M.B.E., has been appointed Chief Welfare Officer and Miss E. D. Price Welfare Officer. The Welfare Section comes under Personnel Department and its office is at 8, Carlton House Terrace. The duties of the Chief Welfare Officer may be briefly summarised as follows: — (1) To examine and make recommendations regarding working conditions of all Foreign Office and Foreign Service staffs whether at home or abroad. (2) To ascertain and circulate to members of the staff particulars of facilities provided by health and hospital associations. (3) 5fo provide information regarding study facilities, care of juveniles, housing and lodging accommodation, enter tainment and recreation facilities. (N.B.—Officers arriving in London from overseas posts and requiring accommodation should continue to apply to Records Section.) (4) To supervise rest room accommodation in the various sections of the Foreign Office and facilities for members of the staff who may be unwell. (5) As regards staff employed at posts abroad, to study local working and living conditions with particular reference to social amenities, and to look into the arrangements for meeting and introducing new arrivals. (6) To deal with any personal complaints regarding working conditions and to act as the liaison between the staff and the authorities in regard to welfare matters generally. His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officer. [p.t.o. 13703—1 [ 32621 — 37 a]The Welfare Officers will see all newly engaged members of the Foreign Office and Foreign Service staff in the junior grades and will, as far as possible, interview before their departure ail officers in these grades appointed to posts abroad. They will be available at all times to assist and advise members of all grades of the Foreign Service (and their wives). I shall be glad if you will bring this information to the atten tion of members of your staff and encourage them to write to the Chief Welfare Officer, who will always be ready to give sympathetic'help and advice on any matter within her sphere. When they are in London they should make a point of calling on her. She will also be glad to discuss with Heads of posts or their representatives any questions concerning the welfare of their staffs. v The Welfare Officers, will from time to time visit Foreign Service posts abroad, and Heads of Missions and Consular posts will be notified in advance when a visit is being arranged. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN.'1 •V [ XS 1/0/10.5 ] ICULAlf No. 121 VyUIRCUl ^ o ^ --T ^ .v-v 1 &gt;5/ U3 Foreign Office, 24^/i December, 1940. Z' Sir, New Regulations of the Foreign Service The creation of the Foreign Service (Branch A) by the amal gamation of the former Diplomatic, Consular and Commercial Diplomatic Services made it necessary to draw up new regula tions, in line with present-day conditions, to govern the terms of service of all members of Branch A of the Foreign Service. 2. A Committee (on which the former Diplomatic and Consular Services were represented) was therefore set up to study the whole question, and their recommendations were examined in conjunction with the Treasury. The ultimate decisions are ^embodied in the new regulations forwarded as an enclosure to this circular despatch. While no pretence is made that these regulations are perfect, and while it would be idle to hope that they will satisfy everybody, they do represent a very considerable overall improvement in the conditions of service. Whereas some officers may lose as a result of one regulation they will gain as a result of others, e.g., ex-consular officers may sometimes lose as a result of the reduction of outfit allowances but they will gain by the grant of furnished accommodation (which removes much of the justification for the former outfit allowance) and by the payment of full travel expenses on leave. It is therefore hoped that very few officers will wish to opt out of the new regulations (as explained in the next paragraph). 3. Copies of the Foreign Service Order-in-Council, 1943, and the provisional Foreign Service Regulation No. 1 are incorporated in the new Regulations, which will be applied to all officers of Branch A as from 1st January, 1947, except that officers who became members of this Branch under Article 2 of the Foreign Service Order-in-Council, 1943,. may opt to remain under the regulations of their former service, taken as a whole. This option will cease to be operative on the officer’s promotion from his existing Grade. Notification of a desire to opt out of the new regulations must reach the Establishment and Organisation Department of the Foreign Office not later than 28th February next. His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officer. [p.t.o. 1373G—1 [32781 —17 a] i My //M-yy . - (Jffi 4. The list of posts for which (1) special leave berms (para graph 7 of liegulation 6^ and paragraph 5 of Regulation 7) and (2) additional outfit allowances (paragraph 5 of Regulation 3) are prescribed is enclosed in circular No. 122 of 24th December, addressed to Superintending Consular Officers. Reconstruction entrants into Branch A will, subject to satisfactory service, receive credit for years of age over 23 for the purposes of entry into Grades 8 and 9 and the salary scales thereof. 5. Pending the introduction of consolidated foreign allowances, the net total of all allowances, except rent, duty and language allowances, will be regarded as the foreign allowance for the purposes of Regulation No. 4 (Foreign Allowances). 6 . Regulation No. 8 (Rent Allowances) provides for furnished accommodation. The rent allowances assigned to officers who occupy furnished accommodation will be re-assessed where necessary, and local drawings on account of rent payments may be increased accordingly, subject to approval from the Foreign Office. 7. Any language allowances at present in issue will be con tinued until the institution of the arrangements described in Regulation No. 9 (Language Allowances) for the assignment of allowances on the new basis. 8 . Pensions are governed by legislation. It is intended in due course to issue information on the subject of retirement and pension. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ERNEST BE YIN.4 [ XS 0141 (1/47) ] I ^ n X Foreign Office, April, 1947 Acceptance by Members of His Majesty’s Foreign Service of Outside Appointments Sir, In my predecessor’s circular despatch XP 6033/6033/907 of the 8 th November, 1944, you were informed of the Treasury Regulations in force at that time regarding the acceptance of business appoint ments by officers of the Crown Services. The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury have now informed me that they have reviewed the instructions which were set forth in that circular, and have now substituted modified regulations. 2. The shortage of experienced staff in relation to the tasks of Government in the transition and reconversion period continues and it is therefore undesirable that established Civil Servants, particularly those filling more responsible posts, should leave the Service save in exceptional circumstances. The Treasury have nevertheless decided to cancel the previous instructions with effect from 1st February, 1947, and to bring into effect the arrangements detailed in the following paragraph. 3. In order that the position can be kept under review the Treasury require to be informed of all impending resignations (other than resignations of women on marriage) as distinct from retirement, of Civil Servants in the Administrative Class or in any non-Administrative grade carrying a maximum salary of not less than £1,000 consolidated. The information required is the present rank of the officer concerned, the date of the proposed resignation, and the employment which he proposes to take up. 4. A similar procedure should be observed with regard to all members of the Foreign Service of similar standing and you should accordingly send me the necessary details should you learn of any impending resignation among senior members of your staff. 5. The existing regulations governing the acceptance of appointments by Civil Servants which may be held concurrently with their official posts remain unaltered. 6 . A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty’s Representatives (as No. 062). I am, | • , Sir . | ,x \ our obedient Servant, ERNEST BEVIN.

Revised Form of Post Preference Cards It has been found that the post preference cards which were circulated to all posts with Sir A. Cadogan’s letter of 30th December, 1943, have served a useful purpose although not all members of the Service have elected to complete them. 2. An additional paragraph asking for particulars of the languages known has now been included and copies of the revised form are enclosed herewith. I shall be grateful if you will invite all members of Branch A and all established officers who are potential members of Branch B now serving on your staff to complete these forms and return them to Personnel Department on 1st January, 1948, and annually thereafter. There is no necessity for officers of grades 1 to 4 to complete these forms unless they themselves wish to do so. 3.

To His Majesty’s Missions and Superintending Consular Officers M5i8 3471 i—21CIRCULAR No. 20 [ XM 017 (1/47) ] Foreign Office 2Q&gt;th February, 1947 tc* *7 Memorandum Foreign Office Circulars '■'N We have had indications from time to time that Foreign Office circulars of general application or interest to members of the Sendee are not always made available to all interested staff at posts abroad. 2. We attach importance to the principle that all members of the Service, whatever the nature of their work, should be regarded as integral parts of one team. Moreover, the process of integration of the former separate services is so near completion that it can be assumed that such circulars of general application affect equally members of the Sendee working in the Chancery, and in the Consular, Commercial, Information or other sections of Missions, or in the various sections of Consular posts. We hope, therefore, that the necessary steps have been or will be taken to ensure that such circulars are seen by all sections. 3. It is also desirable that circulation within a post should be rapid, and if additional copies of circulars are needed to achieve. this, the Despatch section should be asked to supply the necessary numbers of extra copies. 4. A similar circular is being sent to His Majesty’s Repre sentatives (as No. 034). D. J. SCOTT. . His Majesty’s Superintending Consular Officers / 13871—1 33129—6CIRCULAR No. 61. MEMORANDUM. In view of recent changes and the reopening of many consular posts abroad, it is necessary to revise the lists used for the distribution of Foreign Office circulars showing the number of copies of each type of circular which have to be sent to you for transmission, as appropriate, to posts under your superintendence. For this purpose, a form is enclosed which you are asked kindly to complete and return as soon as possible. Communications Department, Foreign Office. 10th July, 1946.

Dear Sir Rupert, We have x agreed with the Foreign Office that they should in future nut the Political Resident snd the Political Agents, Kuwait and. Bahrain on their list of recipients of Foreign Office Circulars. (I gather that Muscat already receives them as a Consul). These printed circulars cover a large variety of subjects mainly of an administrative nature and are sent to all Foreign Office posts abroad, You will of course use your discretion as to how far these are applicable to the Persian Gulf Residency, whether in present circumstances or after April 1st when the Residency will be a Foreign Office post proper. Non-confidential matter will be sent by registered post weekly, and confidential by our bag. Yours sincerely Sgd. F.A.K'. Harrison. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., The Residency, Bahrain.
